10955,traditional rice irrigation systems in uruguay are fully irrigated and early continuously flooded irrigation accounts for a high volume of water used the purpose of this study was to determine irrigation techniques that increase irrigation water productivity wpi allowing a reduction in water input without negatively affecting grain yield in uruguay ten experiments were conducted over a six year period from 2009 to 2015 in three experimental units located among the major rice growing regions treatments included early continuous flooding c alternate wetting and drying awd intermittent flooding until panicle initiation ip and intermittent flooding during all crop growth period i all treatments were planted on dry soil in treatment c flooding started 15 20 days after emergence and a water layer of 10 cm above the soil surface was maintained throughout all the crop cycle in treatments ip and i the water level alternated between 10 cm and 0 cm and was re established when the soil was still saturated the awd treatment allowed the soil to dry periodically water depletion of 50 of soil available water until panicle initiation ip and i over three seasons led to significant savings in irrigation water inputs in the north and central regions averaged 35 or 3986 m3 ha 1 in relation to c in the east region awd allowed for a 29 2067 m3 ha 1 water saving in relation to the control over four seasons but determined a significant yield loss of 1339 kg rice ha 1 15 reduction in relation to c wpi was increased by 0 25 kg m 3 23 in ip and 0 68 kg m 3 62 in i in relation to the control c whole grain percentage was significantly reduced with i in the north region only techniques that maintained the soil water at saturated conditions like intermittent flooding allowed a reduction of water input with no significant effects on grain yield which led to a significant increase in wpi keywords alternate wetting and drying intermittent yield quality water productivity 1 introduction continuously flooded rice is the largest irrigated crop in the world with a higher water demand in relation to other cereal crops pimentel et al 2004 and the major staple food crop with 54 kg consumed per person annually faostat 2018 increasing grain yields and maintaining grain quality while reducing water use is a great challenge for the rice sector globally rising global food demand will increase water use requirements and competition for this resource that is becoming increasingly scarce in some parts of the world tuong and bouman 2003 rijsberman 2006 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 this can be attributed to competition from other sectors environmental concerns and climate change predictions like increased occurrence of drought periods aquifer over extraction loss of water quality by sewage chemical pollution and salinization meybeck et al 1996 bouman et al 2007a siebert et al 2010 reba et al 2013 famiglietti 2014 climate change predictions by many models are indicating increases in temperature more weather variability stocker et al 2013 and higher frequency duration and severity of water shortages spinoni et al 2014 which would limit water availability for irrigation and rice production in the future peng et al 2004 lobell 2007 wassmann et al 2009a 2009b gaydon et al 2010 lyman et al 2013 rice is also the largest irrigated and water consumer crop in uruguay early continuous flooding is the main irrigation technique implemented by farmers to secure the highest yields to maximize profit rice is planted on dry soil conditions flooded from 15 to 25 days after emergence when rice plants have 3 5 leaves v3 v5 according to counce et al 2000 and maintained with a water layer of 5 10 cm until 20 days before harvest rice grown in uy requires from 8000 to 15 000 m3 ha 1 of water battello et al 2009 böcking et al 2008 roel et al 2011 lavecchia et al 2011 riccetto et al 2017 several authors reported rice water requirements for growth within the range from 3550 to 7000 m3 ha 1 pringle 1994 tabbal et al 2002 bouman et al 2007a massey et al 2014 this information is in concordance with the data reported by blanco et al 1984 where only 45 or 6000 m3 ha 1 were evapotranspirated from the 13 300 m3 ha 1 irrigation water input for continuous flooded rice in uruguay those results are also aligned with the ones reported by böcking et al 2008 where evapotranspiration ranged from 5500 to 6780 m3 ha 1 in three studies conducted in the north of uruguay the main benefits of flooding the rice crops are related to more effective weed control an increase in nutrient availability lower disease incidence and thermal insulation protection from cold during microsporogenesis williams and angus 1994 dunn and gaydon 2011 in some countries like australia a deep layer of water 0 20 0 25 m is used during flowering to protect pollen from low temperature humphreys et al 2006 conversely the application of deep water layer during this critical period determined no differences in temperature within the canopy in uruguay roel 2005 some potential disadvantages of the traditional continuously flooded c technique are associated with higher arsenic as accumulation in rice grain linquist et al 2015 carrijo et al 2017 yang et al 2017 carrijo et al 2018 seyfferth et al 2018 and higher green house gas ghg emissions linquist et al 2015 tarlera et al 2016 seyfferth et al 2018 in relation to alternative irrigation techniques like alternate wetting and drying awd uruguay has a subtropical to temperate climate with a great deal of secure water resources river streams lagoon and an average annual rainfall ranging from 1200 mm southwest to 1600 mm northeast castaño et al 2011 average rainfall during the rice growing season from october to march over a 17 year period 1988 2015 was 624 mm ranging from 301 to 934 mm per year carracelas et al 2017 gyga 2019 rainfall it is not evenly distributed during the crop season and for this reason rice cannot be grown without the addition of irrigation water in this country as grain yields are highly penalized resulting in non harvestable yields all rice cultivated in uruguay is irrigated during most of the crop cycle there is an opportunity to optimize rainfall captured by implementing alternative techniques like intermittent irrigation massey et al 2014 de avila et al 2015 the importance of studying and continuing to develop irrigation techniques that use less water while preserving crop yields in uruguay are also driven by the desire to reduce irrigation pumping costs and promote expansion of rice crop area most of the water used to irrigate rice is pumped 56 in uruguay diea mgap 2017 and the cost of energy is a pressing issue for farmers lowering the irrigation cost to increase profit and maintaining enough water to irrigate adequately to secure crop yield potential is one of the main drivers for the implementation of water saving techniques by farmers in uruguay water is a limiting factor for the expansion of rice and other crops dams built for irrigation purposes are the main water source 54 diea mgap 2017 increasing water use efficiency and building new dams would contribute to an increase in irrigated area additionally if more water is available to irrigate other cereal crops and pastures this would create an opportunity for land owners to make more profit and reduce risk by diversification of their products in drought years water stored in the reservoirs in uruguay may not be enough to irrigate 100 of rice fields flooded during the entire growing season new water management techniques have the potential to help farmers cope with water scarcity in dry years worldwide several water saving irrigation techniques have been implemented to reduce water input reduce associated irrigation costs or save water for other purposes bouman et al 2007a but they may have a negative impact on grain yield as rice is very susceptible to water stress tuong et al 2005 much of the research outputs has conflicting result in the impacts of alternative irrigation systems on grain yields rice yields can be reduced under non saturated soil conditions bouman and tuong 2001 tuong et al 2005 parent et al 2010 sudhir yadav et al 2012 and this could be associated with the shallow rice root system parent et al 2010 as well as other factors like diseases weeds or nutrients however other studies reported a significant reduction in water input without affecting rice grain yield and therefore improving water productivity tabbal et al 2002 belder et al 2004 lampayan et al 2005 it is imperative to research and find out the main factors affecting the success of these alternative irrigation techniques over a range of environmental soil and management conditions specific to each country alternative irrigation techniques need to be locally adapted and developed to use less water and minimize off site impacts while preserving grain yield and quality intermittent irrigation and safe alternate wetting and drying are a promising alternative irrigation technique not only for reducing water input and to increase water productivity but also to minimize water footprint environmental impact greenhouse gas emissions and food safety issues especially the accumulation of heavy metals like arsenic in grain linquist et al 2015 tarlera et al 2016 yang et al 2017 carrijo et al 2017 2018 seyfferth et al 2018 this paper is an integrated analysis of different irrigation management practices in experiments conducted at different sites with different soil and slope situations representative of the three rice growing regions of uruguay the main objective of this research was to determine irrigation management practices and techniques that increase wp without negatively affecting grain yield in addition we were looking to identify an optimal irrigation management that could be implemented across all environments or if different techniques need to be developed for each region this study tested the hypothesis that during the crop vegetative phase it is possible to adjust the traditional early irrigation flooding management without affecting grain yield reducing irrigation water input and consequently increasing water productivity wpi and wpir wpi can be defined as the kilograms of grain produced per m3 of irrigation water inputs and wpir is rice yield over volume of water inputs by irrigation and rain kg m 3 evapotranspiration water productivity wpet defined as rice yield over m3 of evapotranspirated water was also reported in this work bouman et al 2007a 2 methods 2 1 study site description the uruguayan rice sector is divided in three regions east 118 391 ha north 33 448 ha and central 12 618 ha representing 72 20 and 8 of

and 3 2 4 treatments and experimental design three irrigation management practices were evaluated in each region north central and east continuous traditional flooding c that represents the most common rice flood management control intermittent irrigation until panicle initiation ip and a third treatment that varied across the region to be able to impose higher water stress in plants intermittent during all cycle i in north central regions and alternate wetting and drying awd in the east fig 2 in treatment c flooding started 15 20 days after emergence and a water layer of 10 cm above the soil surface was maintained after flooding throughout all the crop cycle irrigation water input filled out the bays within levees and replenish evapotranspirated water in treatment ip and i the water layer alternated between 10 cm and 0 cm above the soil surface and was re established when the soil was still saturated the awd treatment permitted the soil to dry periodically allowing a water depletion of 50 of soil available water until panicle initiation the common treatments along the three regions were c and ip and the third treatment was i in north central and awd in east region the experimental design in the east region was a complete randomized block design with four blocks in the north and central region the experimental design was a split plot with 2 blocks main plots

the east region 1 55 kg m 3 and no differences were registered between the north and central regions with an average value of 1 16 kg m 3 fig 8 the analyzed interactions irrigation region and irrigation season were no significantly different also for wpet like the results obtained for wpi and wpir p 0 05 3 3 grain quality implementing alternative water saving irrigation techniques did not influence grain quality parameters such as white grain and chalkiness percentages for all regions in addition whole grain percentage was not affected negatively in the east and central regions table 6 there was no significant effect on number of days to flowering after emergence by implementing alternative irrigation techniques in the north and central regions however ip and awd treatments delayed flowering 50 date by 8 days in average in relation to c in the east region table 6 intermittent irrigation i led to a significant reduction in whole grain percentage of 5 7 in relation to c only in the north region fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 irrigation management effects on water input traditional continuous flooding has been the main irrigation technique for rice implemented by farmers in uruguay irrigation water input measured under continuous flooded conditions averaged 10 000 m3 ha 1 ranging from 7000 to 15 000 m3 ha 1 total water input averaged 16 700 m3 ha 1 when rainfall was included ranging from 12 600 to 21 400 m3ha 1 the big differences measured between regions are associated with the soil characteristics texture organic matter table 1 and land gradients rice in the east and central region is cultivated on lower percolation and lower infiltration rate soils planosols compared to the north areas vertisols slopes in the north region are also higher and field layout techniques in this region are different with lower height and closer contour levees in comparison to the central and east region in this region higher runoff water losses normally occur to maintain the crop being continuously flooded this information is aligned with the irrigation water reported in continuous traditional irrigation by other authors not only in uruguay but also around the world net water input irrigation water plus rainfall minus surface drainage of 15000 15600 m3 ha 1 in australia dunn and gaydon 2011 irrigation water applied from 13 140 to 24 050 m3 ha 1 linquist et al 2015 field measured applied irrigation averaged 8720 ranging from 2440 to 18 800 m3 ha 1 in usa massey et al 2018 total water input rain plus irrigation in field experiments and farmer fields ranged from 6500 to 15 250 m3 ha 1 in china and from 5770 to 35 004 m3 ha 1 in philippines bouman et al 2007a total water input including rainfall measured in experiments ranged from 11 710 14 300 m3 ha 1 in brazil de avila et al 2015 rice receives more irrigation water than is needed according to crop evapotranspiration requirements using traditional irrigation methods the estimated average crop evapotranspiration from emergence until crop harvest etc in this study was 6720 m3 ha 1 with some differences within regions the highest value was registered in the north 7120 m3 ha 1 followed by the central 6650 m3 ha 1 and east region 6390 m3 ha 1 table 2 it was found in validation experiments adapting alternative irrigation techniques on commercial farms on clay soils that 6000 m3 ha 1 of irrigation water input for rice is an achievable target with no yield or quality penalties massey et al 2014 alternative irrigation techniques tested in this paper determined water use savings in all regions evaluated in the north and central the intermittent irrigation ip and i determined a significant input water saving of 28 3237 m3 ha 1 and 41 4736 m3 ha 1 on average in relation to the control continuous flooded respectively there is a chance to optimize rainfall capture and reduce irrigation inputs by implementing alternative irrigation management practices in the east water input saved was lower in relation to the other regions by implementing intermittent irrigation ip 14 1016 m3 ha 1 and even under the more stressed awd treatment 29 2067 m3 ha 1 the lower rainfall received during the crop cycle in the east in relation to the other regions table 2 determined a lower opportunity to optimize rainfall capture by the implementation of alternative irrigation techniques average rainfall registered in our studies from oct to march was 574 mm 670 mm and 795 mm for east north and central regions respectively average rainfall of the three regions 680 mm was 9 higher than the registered historical average over a 17 year period 624 mm database gyga web page carracelas et al 2017 it has been reported by many authors in several studies an increase in rainfall capture by implementing intermittent irrigation techniques and a reduction in irrigation water inputs massey et al 2014 de avila et al 2015 massey et al 2018 the main reasons of reduced water inputs identified by other authors were also associated with a reduction in percolation sudhir yadav et al 2012 and lower floodwater runoff losses bouman et al 2007b reported average water savings of 12 and 18 during two consecutive years were recorded by dunn and gaydon 2011 results from this paper agree with international work and show that intermittent irrigation management has a significant potential to increase wpi across uruguay 4 2 irrigation management effects on grain yield quality and water productivity the implementation of intermittent irrigation until panicle initiation ip technique common experimental treatment along the three regions confirmed that it is possible to reduce water use during the vegetative non critical period without reducing significantly the rice grain yield and not affecting grain quality therefore increasing wpi an average irrigation water saving of 25 approximately 2500 m3 ha 1 and a wpi increase of 23 from 1 09 to 1 34 kg m 3 0 25 kg of grain increase per m3 of water were achieved by implementing the ip irrigation technique in comparison to the traditional continuous flooded practice a non significant yield loss of 4 8 were registered in the ip in comparison with c this result is aligned with information obtained around the world where it was found in several experiments a water saving of 23 on average 5 50 range without significantly reducing grain yield by comparing intermittent saturated soil conditions treatments with continuously flooded c heenan and thompson 1984 borrell et al 1997 bouman and tuong 2001 tabbal et al 2002 results reported in our experiments with the awd treatment tested allowed a 50 depletion of available water indicated a yield loss of 15 in relation to c as soil was allowed to dry down in this paper we confirmed that rice yield can be reduced when soil moisture was below saturation as it was found and reported by other authors bouman and tuong 2001 tuong et al 2005 parent et al 2010 sudhir yadav et al 2012 carrijo et al 2017 also found that yield was reduced by 23 in awd treatments compared to c when soil water potential was lower than 20kpa however there is a high degree of variation in rice yield response to awd depending on timing duration and severity during the drying event of this technique some studies reported a reduction in water input by 15 30 without a significant impact on yield tabbal et al 2002 belder et al 2004 lampayan et al 2005 which were associated with a lower level of stress imposed to rice plants and local climatic conditions soil and slope types ph organic matter texture in some situations of shallow ground water depths 0 10 0 40 m roots can still have access to water even during drying periods in awd like what happens in intermittent irrigation where the soil is always kept saturated in safe awd recommendations soil water depth reaches no more than 0 15 m below the surface and the field is reflooded with the aim to minimize yield penalties to a standing 0 05 m water depth lampayan et al 2009 2015 sudhir yadav et al 2011a 2011b reported an optimum irrigation soil tension of 20 kpa at 0 20 m for awd to reduce irrigation water input without affecting grain yields and therefore improving wpi and wpir other authors also found no yield penalty when soil water potential was higher than 20 kpa carrijo et al 2017 yang et al 2017 or roots were able to provide total transpiration water demand from deeper soil layers carrijo et al 2018 industrial grain quality parameters like whole grain total white chalkiness and green are important in uruguay as poorer grain quality results in reduced paddy price when irrigating intermittently during all the irrigation cycle i whole grain was affected negatively in the north region only land surface gradients and infiltration rate in these soils are higher which makes the successful implementation of this alternative irrigation technique more difficult to maintain soil moisture levels always under saturated conditions uniformly additionally temperature and solar radiation are higher in the north compared to the central and east region table 2 which could increase the stress level and the risk of negatively affecting whole grain percentage this could be attributed to a higher sensitivity of this parameter to higher levels of water stress imposed to plants during the grain filling period this parameter fell below the limit of 58 threshold set by the milling industry and would induce a payment penalty input irrigation water productivity wpi registered in the experiments was on average 1 39 kg m 3 and total wpir was 0 64 kg m 3 averaged across all regions intermittent irrigation implemented during the entire crop cycle i resulted in the highest values of those parameters 1 77 kg m 3 and 0 71 kg m 3for wpi and wpir respectively compared to 1 09 and 0 59 kg m 3 in the control water productivity values reported in this study are very good compared with ranges reported internationally 0 2 0 4 kg m 3 in india with continuous flooded 0 3 1 1 kg m 3 in philippines bouman and tuong 2001 sudhir yadav et al 2012 wp considering total water input equals 0 4 kg m 3 ranging from 0 2 to 1 2 bouman et al 2007a there are several definitions of wp as it was pointed out by bouman et al 2007a which denotes the amount kg rice grain yield over volume of water used water productivity can be defined as the values reported in this paper that consider the rice yield over volume of water inputs by irrigation wpi and rice yield over volume of water inputs by irrigation and rainfall wpir this information is valuable for irrigation engineers managers and farmers that are interested in optimizing the productivity of irrigation water and total water resources rainfall and irrigation water and also for regional water resource planners that could be interested in the amount of grain food that can be produced with total water resources bouman et al 2007a on the other hand rice breeders are interested in the productivity of the amount of transpired water wpt or evapotranspiration wpet for selecting more water efficient cultivars bouman et al 2007b and sudhir yadav et al 2012 reported wpet average values that ranged from 1 0 to 1 5 kg m 3 using the simulation crop model oryza with no significant differences within several irrigation water tension threshold this information is aligned with estimated average wpet values determined in this work 1 15 1 16 and 1 55 kg m 3 for the north central and east region respectively additionally no significant differences were registered for c ip and i irrigation treatments with an average wpet of 1 33 kg m 3 however awd determined a significant wpet reduction of 13 which was mainly explained by the significant reduction of grain yield when this irrigation technique was implemented this study helped to identify irrigation techniques that use significantly less water while maintaining rice grain yield and therefore increasing wp across a range of typical irrigated rice growing regions in uruguay more research is needed in awd and validation studies before promoting wide scale adoption of this alternative technique further research is also required to evaluate ranges of safer alternate wetting and drying management strategies that maintain soil water depletion in a range that does not reduce rice grain yields intermittent irrigation until panicle initiation is the most promising irrigation technique to save water without penalizing grain yields and quality across uruguay if the 25 water saved by implementing the ip technique is used to promote the expansion of rice crops in uruguay an additional 32 000 ha of rice could be annually cultivated equivalent to 0 26 mt of total rice production over the already 1 4 mt available for trade would be possible widespread adoption of intermittent irrigation techniques could have the potential to expand rice crop area and significantly increase total rice production in uruguay however results were obtained on experimental plots where irrigation is easy to manage under commercial conditions the implementation of intermittent irrigation would be more challenging associated with scalability and agronomic concerns such as weeds and nutrients there is a risk of losing yield quality and total income by implementing alternative irrigation techniques on larger scales therefore the implementation of this technology will be limited unless an economic incentive is applied for farmers to use water more efficiently as has been reported in other studies worldwide bouman et al 2007a linquist et al 2015 in the current scenario of increasing production costs low grain prices and lacking economic incentives to adopt water saving techniques continuous flooding from 15 to 20 days after emergence is likely to remain the standard adopted and recommended practice in uruguay unless policy incentives are put in place ip is a potential successful viable irrigation alternative to be validated across uruguay while awd would need more research before wide scale adoption 5 conclusions alternative irrigation techniques like intermittent irrigation in north central and alternate wetting and drying awd in the east region allowed a significant irrigation water saving of 5175 35 2798 34 and 2067 m3 ha 1 29 respectively compared to the early continuous flooded systems average irrigation water input was 7900 m3 ha 1 and total irrigation water input plus rainfall was 14 700 m3 ha 1 in the continuous flooded treatment rice yield was not negatively affected when intermittent irrigation techniques were implemented and soils were maintained above saturation alternating wetting and drying conditions with 50 of soil available water depletion determined a yield loss of 1339 kgs 15 in relation to the traditional continuous flooded treatment average water productivity for all treatments considering only irrigation water wpi and total with rainfall wpir was 1 39 kg m 3 and 0 64 kg m 3 respectively water productivity was significantly increased with the implementation of intermittent irrigation techniques by 0 25 kg m 3 from 1 09 to 1 34 with ip until panicle initiation and by 0 68 kg m 3 from 1 09 to 1 77 with i during all irrigation period in relation to the continuous flooded treatment evapotranspiration wpet was not affected by the implementation of intermittent irrigation ip i in relation to the continuous flooded control c average wpet 1 33 kg m 3 awd determined a significant reduction of 0 20 kg m 3 in wpet in relation to c industrial quality white grain and chalkiness was not affected negatively by implementing alternative irrigation technics in all regions however intermittent irrigation during the entire crop cycle reduced significantly whole grain percentage in the north intermittent irrigation until panicle initiation ip shown in this study to be a technology that allowed a significant increase in water productivity without negatively affecting rice grain yield with no effect on grain industrial quality and a significant reduction in irrigation water input in

10955,traditional rice irrigation systems in uruguay are fully irrigated and early continuously flooded irrigation accounts for a high volume of water used the purpose of this study was to determine irrigation techniques that increase irrigation water productivity wpi allowing a reduction in water input without negatively affecting grain yield in uruguay ten experiments were conducted over a six year period from 2009 to 2015 in three experimental units located among the major rice growing regions treatments included early continuous flooding c alternate wetting and drying awd intermittent flooding until panicle initiation ip and intermittent flooding during all crop growth period i all treatments were planted on dry soil in treatment c flooding started 15 20 days after emergence and a water layer of 10 cm above the soil surface was maintained throughout all the crop cycle in treatments ip and i the water level alternated between 10 cm and 0 cm and was re established when the soil was still saturated the awd treatment allowed the soil to dry periodically water depletion of 50 of soil available water until panicle initiation ip and i over three seasons led to significant savings in irrigation water inputs in the north and central regions averaged 35 or 3986 m3 ha 1 in relation to c in the east region awd allowed for a 29 2067 m3 ha 1 water saving in relation to the control over four seasons but determined a significant yield loss of 1339 kg rice ha 1 15 reduction in relation to c wpi was increased by 0 25 kg m 3 23 in ip and 0 68 kg m 3 62 in i in relation to the control c whole grain percentage was significantly reduced with i in the north region only techniques that maintained the soil water at saturated conditions like intermittent flooding allowed a reduction of water input with no significant effects on grain yield which led to a significant increase in wpi keywords alternate wetting and drying intermittent yield quality water productivity 1 introduction continuously flooded rice is the largest irrigated crop in the world with a higher water demand in relation to other cereal crops pimentel et al 2004 and the major staple food crop with 54 kg consumed per person annually faostat 2018 increasing grain yields and maintaining grain quality while reducing water use is a great challenge for the rice sector globally rising global food demand will increase water use requirements and competition for this resource that is becoming increasingly scarce in some parts of the world tuong and bouman 2003 rijsberman 2006 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 this can be attributed to competition from other sectors environmental concerns and climate change predictions like increased occurrence of drought periods aquifer over extraction loss of water quality by sewage chemical pollution and salinization meybeck et al 1996 bouman et al 2007a siebert et al 2010 reba et al 2013 famiglietti 2014 climate change predictions by many models are indicating increases in temperature more weather variability stocker et al 2013 and higher frequency duration and severity of water shortages spinoni et al 2014 which would limit water availability for irrigation and rice production in the future peng et al 2004 lobell 2007 wassmann et al 2009a 2009b gaydon et al 2010 lyman et al 2013 rice is also the largest irrigated and water consumer crop in uruguay early continuous flooding is the main irrigation technique implemented by farmers to secure the highest yields to maximize profit rice is planted on dry soil conditions flooded from 15 to 25 days after emergence when rice plants have 3 5 leaves v3 v5 according to counce et al 2000 and maintained with a water layer of 5 10 cm until 20 days before harvest rice grown in uy requires from 8000 to 15 000 m3 ha 1 of water battello et al 2009 böcking et al 2008 roel et al 2011 lavecchia et al 2011 riccetto et al 2017 several authors reported rice water requirements for growth within the range from 3550 to 7000 m3 ha 1 pringle 1994 tabbal et al 2002 bouman et al 2007a massey et al 2014 this information is in concordance with the data reported by blanco et al 1984 where only 45 or 6000 m3 ha 1 were evapotranspirated from the 13 300 m3 ha 1 irrigation water input for continuous flooded rice in uruguay those results are also aligned with the ones reported by böcking et al 2008 where evapotranspiration ranged from 5500 to 6780 m3 ha 1 in three studies conducted in the north of uruguay the main benefits of flooding the rice crops are related to more effective weed control an increase in nutrient availability lower disease incidence and thermal insulation protection from cold during microsporogenesis williams and angus 1994 dunn and gaydon 2011 in some countries like australia a deep layer of water 0 20 0 25 m is used during flowering to protect pollen from low temperature humphreys et al 2006 conversely the application of deep water layer during this critical period determined no differences in temperature within the canopy in uruguay roel 2005 some potential disadvantages of the traditional continuously flooded c technique are associated with higher arsenic as accumulation in rice grain linquist et al 2015 carrijo et al 2017 yang et al 2017 carrijo et al 2018 seyfferth et al 2018 and higher green house gas ghg emissions linquist et al 2015 tarlera et al 2016 seyfferth et al 2018 in relation to alternative irrigation techniques like alternate wetting and drying awd uruguay has a subtropical to temperate climate with a great deal of secure water resources river streams lagoon and an average annual rainfall ranging from 1200 mm southwest to 1600 mm northeast castaño et al 2011 average rainfall during the rice growing season from october to march over a 17 year period 1988 2015 was 624 mm ranging from 301 to 934 mm per year carracelas et al 2017 gyga 2019 rainfall it is not evenly distributed during the crop season and for this reason rice cannot be grown without the addition of irrigation water in this country as grain yields are highly penalized resulting in non harvestable yields all rice cultivated in uruguay is irrigated during most of the crop cycle there is an opportunity to optimize rainfall captured by implementing alternative techniques like intermittent irrigation massey et al 2014 de avila et al 2015 the importance of studying and continuing to develop irrigation techniques that use less water while preserving crop yields in uruguay are also driven by the desire to reduce irrigation pumping costs and promote expansion of rice crop area most of the water used to irrigate rice is pumped 56 in uruguay diea mgap 2017 and the cost of energy is a pressing issue for farmers lowering the irrigation cost to increase profit and maintaining enough water to irrigate adequately to secure crop yield potential is one of the main drivers for the implementation of water saving techniques by farmers in uruguay water is a limiting factor for the expansion of rice and other crops dams built for irrigation purposes are the main water source 54 diea mgap 2017 increasing water use efficiency and building new dams would contribute to an increase in irrigated area additionally if more water is available to irrigate other cereal crops and pastures this would create an opportunity for land owners to make more profit and reduce risk by diversification of their products in drought years water stored in the reservoirs in uruguay may not be enough to irrigate 100 of rice fields flooded during the entire growing season new water management techniques have the potential to help farmers cope with water scarcity in dry years worldwide several water saving irrigation techniques have been implemented to reduce water input reduce associated irrigation costs or save water for other purposes bouman et al 2007a but they may have a negative impact on grain yield as rice is very susceptible to water stress tuong et al 2005 much of the research outputs has conflicting result in the impacts of alternative irrigation systems on grain yields rice yields can be reduced under non saturated soil conditions bouman and tuong 2001 tuong et al 2005 parent et al 2010 sudhir yadav et al 2012 and this could be associated with the shallow rice root system parent et al 2010 as well as other factors like diseases weeds or nutrients however other studies reported a significant reduction in water input without affecting rice grain yield and therefore improving water productivity tabbal et al 2002 belder et al 2004 lampayan et al 2005 it is imperative to research and find out the main factors affecting the success of these alternative irrigation techniques over a range of environmental soil and management conditions specific to each country alternative irrigation techniques need to be locally adapted and developed to use less water and minimize off site impacts while preserving grain yield and quality intermittent irrigation and safe alternate wetting and drying are a promising alternative irrigation technique not only for reducing water input and to increase water productivity but also to minimize water footprint environmental impact greenhouse gas emissions and food safety issues especially the accumulation of heavy metals like arsenic in grain linquist et al 2015 tarlera et al 2016 yang et al 2017 carrijo et al 2017 2018 seyfferth et al 2018 this paper is an integrated analysis of different irrigation management practices in experiments conducted at different sites with different soil and slope situations representative of the three rice growing regions of uruguay the main objective of this research was to determine irrigation management practices and techniques that increase wp without negatively affecting grain yield in addition we were looking to identify an optimal irrigation management that could be implemented across all environments or if different techniques need to be developed for each region this study tested the hypothesis that during the crop vegetative phase it is possible to adjust the traditional early irrigation flooding management without affecting grain yield reducing irrigation water input and consequently increasing water productivity wpi and wpir wpi can be defined as the kilograms of grain produced per m3 of irrigation water inputs and wpir is rice yield over volume of water inputs by irrigation and rain kg m 3 evapotranspiration water productivity wpet defined as rice yield over m3 of evapotranspirated water was also reported in this

the north region fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 irrigation management effects on water input traditional continuous flooding has been the main irrigation technique for rice implemented by farmers in uruguay irrigation water input measured under continuous flooded conditions averaged 10 000 m3 ha 1 ranging from 7000 to 15 000 m3 ha 1 total water input averaged 16 700 m3 ha 1 when rainfall was included ranging from 12 600 to 21 400 m3ha 1 the big differences measured between regions are associated with the soil characteristics texture organic matter table 1 and land gradients rice in the east and central region is cultivated on lower percolation and lower infiltration rate soils planosols compared to the north areas vertisols slopes in the north region are also higher and field layout techniques in this region are different with lower height and closer contour levees in comparison to the central and east region in this region higher runoff water losses normally occur to maintain the crop being continuously flooded this information is aligned with the irrigation water reported in continuous traditional irrigation by other authors not only in uruguay but also around the world

brazil de avila et al 2015 rice receives more irrigation water than is needed according to crop evapotranspiration requirements using traditional irrigation methods the estimated average crop evapotranspiration from emergence until crop harvest etc in this study was 6720 m3 ha 1 with some differences within regions the highest value was registered in the north 7120 m3 ha 1 followed by the central 6650 m3 ha 1 and east region 6390 m3 ha 1 table 2 it was found in validation experiments adapting alternative irrigation techniques on commercial farms on clay soils that 6000 m3 ha 1 of irrigation water input for rice is an achievable target with no yield or quality penalties massey et al 2014 alternative irrigation techniques tested in this paper determined water use savings in all regions evaluated in the north and central the intermittent irrigation ip and i determined a significant input water saving of 28 3237 m3 ha 1 and 41 4736 m3 ha 1 on average in relation to the control continuous flooded respectively there is a chance to optimize rainfall capture and reduce irrigation inputs by implementing alternative irrigation management practices in the east water input saved was lower in relation to the other regions by implementing intermittent irrigation ip 14 1016 m3 ha 1 and even under the more stressed awd treatment 29 2067 m3 ha 1 the lower rainfall received during the crop cycle in the east in relation to the other regions table 2 determined a lower opportunity to optimize rainfall capture by the implementation of alternative irrigation techniques average rainfall registered in our studies from oct to march was 574 mm 670 mm and 795 mm for east north and central regions respectively average rainfall of the three regions 680 mm was 9 higher than the registered historical average over a 17 year period 624 mm database gyga web page carracelas et al 2017 it has been reported by many authors in several studies an increase in rainfall capture by implementing intermittent irrigation techniques and a reduction in irrigation water inputs massey et al 2014 de avila et al 2015 massey et al 2018 the main reasons of reduced water inputs identified by other authors were also associated with a reduction in percolation sudhir yadav et al 2012 and lower floodwater runoff losses bouman et al 2007b reported average water savings of 12 and 18 during two consecutive years were recorded by dunn and gaydon 2011 results from this paper agree with international work and show that intermittent irrigation management has a significant potential to increase wpi across uruguay 4 2 irrigation management effects on grain yield quality and water productivity the implementation of intermittent irrigation until panicle initiation ip technique common experimental treatment along the three regions confirmed that it is possible to reduce water use during the vegetative non critical period without reducing significantly the rice grain yield and not affecting grain quality therefore increasing wpi an average irrigation water saving of 25 approximately 2500 m3 ha 1 and a wpi increase of 23 from 1 09 to 1 34 kg m 3 0 25 kg of grain increase per m3 of water were achieved by implementing the ip irrigation technique in comparison to the traditional continuous flooded practice a non significant yield loss of 4 8 were registered in the ip in comparison with c this result is aligned with information obtained around the world where it was found in several experiments a water saving of 23 on average 5 50 range without significantly reducing grain yield by comparing intermittent saturated soil conditions treatments with continuously flooded c heenan and thompson 1984 borrell et al 1997 bouman and tuong 2001 tabbal et al 2002 results reported in our experiments with the awd treatment tested allowed a 50 depletion of available water indicated a yield loss of 15 in relation to c as soil was allowed to dry down in this paper we confirmed that rice yield can be reduced when soil moisture was below saturation as it was found and reported by other authors bouman and tuong 2001 tuong et al 2005 parent et al 2010 sudhir yadav et al 2012 carrijo et al 2017 also found that yield was reduced by 23 in awd treatments compared to c when soil water potential was lower than 20kpa however there is a high degree of variation in rice yield response to awd depending on timing duration and severity during the drying event of this technique some studies reported a reduction in water input by 15 30 without a significant impact on yield tabbal et al 2002 belder et al 2004 lampayan et al 2005 which were associated with a lower level of stress imposed to rice plants and local climatic conditions soil and slope types ph organic matter texture in some situations of shallow ground water depths 0 10 0 40 m roots can still have access to water even during drying periods in awd like what happens in intermittent irrigation where the soil is always kept saturated in safe awd recommendations soil water depth reaches no more than 0 15 m below the surface and the field is reflooded with the aim to minimize yield penalties to a standing 0 05 m water depth lampayan et al 2009 2015 sudhir yadav et al 2011a 2011b reported an optimum irrigation soil tension of 20 kpa at 0 20 m for awd to reduce irrigation water input without affecting grain yields and therefore improving wpi and wpir other authors also found no yield penalty when soil water potential was higher than 20 kpa carrijo et al 2017 yang et al 2017 or roots were able to provide total transpiration water demand from deeper soil layers carrijo et al 2018 industrial grain quality parameters like whole grain total white chalkiness and green are important in uruguay as poorer grain quality results in reduced paddy price when irrigating intermittently during all the irrigation cycle i whole grain was affected negatively in the north region only land surface gradients and infiltration rate in these soils are higher which makes the successful implementation of this alternative irrigation technique more difficult to maintain soil moisture levels always under saturated conditions uniformly additionally temperature and solar radiation are higher in the north compared to the central and east region table 2 which could increase the stress level and the risk of negatively affecting whole grain percentage this could be attributed to a higher sensitivity of this parameter to higher levels of water stress imposed to plants during the grain filling period this parameter fell below the limit of 58 threshold set by the milling industry and would induce a payment penalty input irrigation water productivity wpi registered in the experiments was on average 1 39 kg m 3 and total wpir was 0 64 kg m 3 averaged across all regions intermittent irrigation implemented during the entire crop cycle i resulted in the highest values of those parameters 1 77 kg m 3 and 0 71 kg m 3for wpi and wpir respectively compared to 1 09 and 0 59 kg m 3 in the control water productivity values reported in this study are very good compared with ranges reported internationally 0 2 0 4 kg m 3 in india with continuous flooded 0 3 1 1 kg m 3 in philippines bouman and tuong 2001 sudhir yadav et al 2012 wp considering total water input equals 0 4 kg m 3 ranging from 0 2 to 1 2 bouman et al 2007a there are several definitions of wp as it was pointed out by bouman et al 2007a which denotes the amount kg rice grain yield over volume of water used water productivity can be defined as the values reported in this paper that consider the rice yield over volume of water inputs by irrigation wpi and rice yield over volume of water inputs by irrigation and rainfall wpir this information is valuable for irrigation engineers managers and farmers that are interested in optimizing the productivity of irrigation water and total water resources rainfall and irrigation water and also for regional water resource planners that could be interested in the amount of grain food that can be produced with total water resources bouman et al 2007a on the other hand rice breeders are interested in the productivity of the amount of transpired water wpt or evapotranspiration wpet for selecting more water efficient cultivars bouman et al 2007b and sudhir yadav et al 2012 reported wpet average values that ranged from 1 0 to 1 5 kg m 3 using the simulation crop model oryza with no significant differences within several irrigation water tension threshold this information is aligned with estimated average wpet values determined in this work 1 15 1 16 and 1 55 kg m 3 for the north central and east region respectively additionally no significant differences were registered for c ip and i irrigation treatments with an average wpet of 1 33 kg m 3 however awd determined a significant wpet reduction of 13 which was mainly explained by the significant reduction of grain yield when this irrigation technique was implemented this study helped to identify irrigation techniques that use significantly less water while maintaining rice grain yield and therefore increasing wp across a range of typical irrigated rice growing regions in uruguay more research is needed in awd and validation studies before promoting wide scale adoption of this alternative technique further research is also required to evaluate ranges of safer alternate wetting and drying management strategies that maintain soil water depletion in a range that does not reduce rice grain yields intermittent irrigation until panicle initiation is the most promising irrigation technique to save water without penalizing grain yields and quality across uruguay if the 25 water saved by implementing the ip technique is used to promote the expansion of rice crops in uruguay an additional 32 000 ha of rice could be annually cultivated equivalent to 0 26 mt of total rice production over the already 1 4 mt available for trade would be possible widespread adoption of intermittent irrigation techniques could have the potential to expand rice crop area and significantly increase total rice production in uruguay however results were obtained on experimental plots where irrigation is easy to manage under commercial conditions the implementation of intermittent irrigation would be more challenging associated with scalability and agronomic concerns such as weeds and nutrients there is a risk of losing yield quality and total income by implementing alternative irrigation techniques on larger scales therefore the implementation of this technology will be limited unless an economic incentive is applied for farmers to use water more efficiently as has been reported in other studies worldwide bouman et al 2007a linquist et al 2015 in the current scenario of increasing production costs low grain prices and lacking economic incentives to adopt water saving techniques continuous flooding from 15 to 20 days after emergence is likely to remain the standard adopted and recommended practice in uruguay unless policy incentives are put in place ip is a potential successful viable irrigation alternative to be validated across uruguay while awd would need more research before wide scale adoption 5 conclusions alternative irrigation techniques like intermittent irrigation in north central and alternate wetting and drying awd in the east region allowed a significant irrigation water saving of 5175 35 2798 34 and 2067 m3 ha 1 29 respectively compared to the early continuous flooded systems average irrigation water input was 7900 m3 ha 1 and total irrigation water input plus rainfall was 14 700 m3 ha 1 in the continuous flooded treatment rice yield was not negatively affected when intermittent irrigation techniques were implemented and soils were maintained above saturation alternating wetting and drying conditions with 50 of soil available water depletion determined a yield loss of 1339 kgs 15 in relation to the traditional continuous flooded treatment average water productivity for all treatments considering only irrigation water wpi and total with rainfall wpir was 1 39 kg m 3 and 0 64 kg m 3 respectively water productivity was significantly increased with the implementation of intermittent irrigation techniques by 0 25 kg m 3 from 1 09 to 1 34 with ip until panicle initiation and by 0 68 kg m 3 from 1 09 to 1 77 with i during all irrigation period in relation to the continuous flooded treatment evapotranspiration wpet was not affected by the implementation of intermittent irrigation ip i in relation to the continuous flooded control c average wpet 1 33 kg m 3 awd determined a significant reduction of 0 20 kg m 3 in wpet in relation to c industrial quality white grain and chalkiness was not affected negatively by implementing alternative irrigation technics in all regions however intermittent irrigation during the entire crop cycle reduced significantly whole grain percentage in the north intermittent irrigation until panicle initiation ip shown in this study to be a technology that allowed a significant increase in water productivity without negatively affecting rice grain yield with no effect on grain industrial quality and a significant reduction in irrigation water input in

10956,increasing water reliability in a catchment requires reducing the total quantity of water available to users in some years in order to supply it in more years when its supply is constrained thus the more reliable the supply the more water that needs to be withheld consequently increased levels of water reliability to a catchment which reduces the costs associated with an unreliable supply often comes at an incremental increase in costs that researchers do not consider that of the water foregone that could be have been used productively if the system had been run less reliably in this paper the trade offs between the costs of water foregone to maintain a level of reliability and the costs associated with an unreliable supply of water at different levels of reliability in an irrigation system are discussed the concepts developed are applied to the irrigation sector in the musi catchment in andhra pradesh india from 2011 to 2040 in this catchment it was found that the costs of water foregone to increase reliability rise as the level of reliability rises while the benefits generally fall when the level of reliability exceeded approximately 85 where water is so scarce that it is used on only the most valuable output the costs of greater reliability exceed the benefits resulting in net losses to the system these results were found to vary in each demand centre across the catchment these results have implications for those considering innovations that improve the level of reliability in a catchment keywords water use and management water planning reliability foregone benefits catchments 1 introduction renault 2001 p 216 argued that the trade off between the costs and benefits of a reliable surface water supply is not very well understood studies on reliability in irrigation service are unfortunately rare while a few analysts such as playán and mateos 2006 tongongar et al 2008 and garrote et al 2015 have since dealt with aspects of the reliability at the farm level none have attempted to estimate the trade offs between the benefits and costs from different levels of reliability in a catchment or an irrigation system the benefits of an improved level of reliability are to be found in the reductions in the losses associated with not supplying water to an adequate level in more years while the costs are to be found in valuing the increased amount of water needed to maintain a higher level of reliability complicating this analysis is the fact that as water becomes more scarce the per unit value rises as it is used to produce more valuable crops the aim in this paper is to research these trade offs in an attempt to determine the point at which the costs from a selected level of reliability are minimised and the point at which the costs of further increases in reliability outweigh the benefits across a catchment there are numerous studies on the reliability of water resource systems two seminal studies that stand out are the pioneering work of hashimoto et al 1982 on the interactions between reliability resilience and vulnerability and by griffin and mjelde 2000 on valuing water supply reliability to hashimoto et al 1982 the performance of a water resource system was dependent on its reliability which they defined around the concept of the likelihood of a system failing or not its resilience how quickly it recovers from a failure and its vulnerability the severity of the consequences of a failure using the hypothetical example of a storage facility hashimoto et al 1982 p 19 concluded that realistic policies would have high reliability modest resilience and close to minimal vulnerability many studies especially in the environmental sphere have followed their lead and attempted to measure these concepts with some like moy et al 1986 who found that as reliability increased minimising the limits when a shortfall occurred or if the resilience was increased the vulnerability to larger deficits also increased others like kundzewicz and kindler 1995 and kjeldsen and rosbjerg 2004 found the approach difficult to estimate as an overlap exists between the three criteria something that srinivasan et al 1999 attempted to overcome griffin and mjelde 2000 working on municipal water supply systems argued that perfect 100 water supply reliability was not optimal when water development costs were high they make the point that water supply systems are operated by people whose performance is gauged by their ability to deliver a dependable steady and problem free water supply they are not judged by their ability to deliver water that has value in excess of its costs p 414 not only do griffin and mjelde go on to improve the specification of reliability away from the idea that all that was considered was a fail or not fail outcome to a more realistic one where there is a degree of failure they also valued the consumers perceptions of reliability and what they were willing to pay for it armed with the knowledge of supply and inflows into a system those who establish and maintain the system estimate how much water should be released and when that should occur thus determining the level of reliability however a range of releases could be made from an established supply everything from releasing the stock of water in its entirety at one point in time through to releasing small measured amounts on a regular basis in a consistent manner over a number of years what is not stated explicitly by either hashimoto et al 1982 or griffin and mjedla although moy et al 1986 allude to it with their assertion that an increase in reliability will lead to greater vulnerability is that there must be a relationship between the level of reliability the actual quantity released and the quantity of water withheld to maintain reliability at different levels the higher the level of reliability the greater the amount of water that needs to be held back in the system or spilled if storage is insufficient in the event of adverse circumstances in reserving more water at higher levels of reliability system operators have less water available for current use this water that is held back or lost has a value that should be incorporated in an economic assessment of reliability the measures developed by hashimoto et al 1982 are determined by both the releases of water and the uses they are put to whenever that may be thus taking a dam centric view of a water resource system obscures the fact that reliability measured on the releases from a central system are possibly not the same thing as the reliability measured at the point where water is used even if one accounts for transmission losses in addition other sources of supply such as the contribution of groundwater need to be accounted for further as griffin and mjedla 2000 p 414 point out available water is physically limited in many regions so when municipalities increase water system reliability they are shifting risk to non municipal sectors moreover if one is interested in the reliable delivery of water to a system then there is no guarantee that it will be the same at different points in a complex water system or to a diverse group of water users in reality the exact opposite might well be expected a better approach one that is more consistent with the way those who establish and maintain an irrigation system see it is to work with a simulation model where it is possible to assess the outcomes from coordinating operations between different parts of the system as tilmant et al 2012 and marques and tilmant 2013 did finally it should be acknowledged that increasing reliability comes at a cost as griffin and mjedla 2000 p 414 suggest the reliability of water systems may be too high water supplies dedicated to municipal use may be too great and infrastructure costs may be too large while this is true what tends to be forgotten in this formal accounting of the infrastructural costs of maintaining reliability which are usually fixed and sunk is that there is also a cost associated with holding water in reserve or unused if sufficient storage is not available that is the foregone value of what the water in reserve could be used for often the economic considerations are ignored in many studies of reliability vogel and bolognese 1995 p 645 argue that most approaches do not impart much knowledge about overall resource system behaviour even studies such as tilmant et al 2012 that have attempted to account of coordinating water in different storages have not accounted for the changes in the marginal benefits of that water when different quantities are involved what vogel and bolognese 1995 p 645 argue for are simple yet accurate expressions which can easily be exploited to describe the resilience of water supply systems 2 aims the aim in this paper is to assess more widely the costs and benefits from setting the level of reliability in a complex water resource system of particular interest is to assess the relationship between the level of reliability and the quantity of water available for use at each individual demand centre in a complex catchment or river basin system incorporate the costs of water held within a system into the costs and benefits of maintaining a reliable system and view and assess different levels of system reliability within a complex water resource system one that has multiple spatial and temporal dimensions to it from the perspective of multiple demand centres rather than from a single point of supply ultimately the objective is to reveal the trade offs between the economic costs and benefits of different levels of system reliability as stated earlier the costs of increasing water reliability within an existing system can be defined in terms of the economic losses associated with withholding increasing amounts of water required to maintain it at a higher level the benefits of increasing reliability within an existing system can be defined in terms of the reductions in losses associated with having a reduced supply more regularly delivered in doing this it should be possible to determine the levels of reliability at which a system could be operated where the benefits and costs are equal the breakeven point and where the net costs from the system are minimised to demonstrate the approach developed in this paper a case study of the musi catchment in andhra pradesh india is presented the reliability of flows in the catchment are derived from the flow duration curves associated with each water demand centre in the system which in turn are used to determine the costs and benefits of supplying water at different levels of reliability in the catchment once the value of water has been accounted for this study builds on earlier work undertaken by george et al 2011c on the hydrology of the musi catchment and by hellegers and davidson 2010 on the economic value from irrigated agriculture in the region in presenting these issues the concept of system reliability is defined and quantified then the concepts of the costs and benefits in this context are discussed along with the notion of finding the point where the benefits of increasing reliability by reducing the losses associated with an inadequate supply exceed the costs of maintaining the quantities of water required to achieve it finally the results of the case study are presented and the implications discussed in this study the infrastructure and operating costs of attaining different levels of reliability and the additional flow on benefits to society of different levels or reliability are not considered consideration is only given to the changes in the values of the water itself the focus in this paper is on multiple water demand centres within a catchment system with multiple infrastructure and supply nodes what happens within demand centres along the canal systems and the reliability to individual farmers and users is not considered in this paper 3 the water supply reliability relationship at a very superficial level it is easy to believe that higher levels of reliability are more desirable than lower levels after all greater reliability from any system is thought to be a desirable goal the reliability performance indicators developed by hashimoto et al 1982 suggest that in general reliability increases as supply increases this behaviour is always true when dealing with volumetric reliability from the users perspective mcmahon et al 2006 however can the same be suggested from a system wide perspective especially where the quantity of water available in a catchment is fixed over time there is an inverse relationship between the degree of reliability and the actual amount of water supplied at that level george et al 2011c the greater the level of reliability i e the more years in which a supply amount is guaranteed the smaller the quantity of water that can be securely delivered in each individual year increasing reliability must have a consequence on the uses and hence on the total economic returns to water especially for uses such as irrigated agriculture where less water provided more reliably may well result in lower total returns than a less reliable service kundzewicz and kindler 1995 provide an excellent description of the different ways water management reliability can be measured from a physical perspective they describe occurrence reliability temporal reliability volumetric reliability and annual reliability all in terms of whether a system satisfactorily performs or not over time and or on the quantities supplied and demanded vogel and bolognese 1995 make the point that system reliability is thought of differently in the us when compared to the rest of the world the non us approach is used in this study i e a steady state probability of system failure system reliability is often measured as the frequency or probability of the success of the system and is calculated by counting the number of years that the system was in a satisfactory state compared to the total simulation length asefa et al 2014 it is also expressed the number of years the flow available is equal to or exceeds a certain value out of 100 years hann 1977 ambiguities exist in the way that reliability is attached to the natural water flow available at a specific location in a regulated catchment as opposed to the water available to a specific supply point in the catchment the latter involves considerations of actual demand and hydraulic infrastructure in addition to the sole consideration of natural resource availability questions surrounding reliability can also be directed towards either the system as a whole and or the individual user within it be this an irrigator an urban user or an industrial user while these two elements the system and the individual users are related each element needs to be assessed differently with an individual the risks and uncertainties surrounding reliability centre on the choices of what use to make of their water while with the system the issue is about the bulk supply of a product called water to the system and how secure that supply is the discussion in this paper centres only on system reliability schenk et al 2014 discuss some of the issues surrounding water security and individual user choices in light of water scarcity and security it is also important to note that in the context of this study the focus is not the reliability of resource availability determined by the hydrology of the catchment alone but by the relationship between hydrologic availability actual water demand and constraints of the system infrastructure at a demand centre level that means the minimum volume of water that the system can provide at a given probability of exceedance these criteria also entail that in some years a greater volume can be supplied to the system than that linked to the specified probability of exceedance the concept of system reliability in general has been used for a range of purposes sometimes beyond that which it is intended in this paper of interest is the reliability of water supply to an entire demand centre bulk supply level within a catchment system it is a measure of how well a system performs in meeting a certain level of security of bulk water supply to an entire demand centre under a set of infrastructure and operational settings in the system the concept of system reliability of supply at a bulk level entails the notion of aggregate bulk supply rather than the reliability of supply to users within a system such as individual irrigators or household users in an urban system the reliability of supply at an individual user level is determined by a number of other factors in addition to the system reliability of bulk supply these may include the adequate operation of the canal system in an irrigation district or the frequency of pipe bursts or pump failures in an urban water supply the reliability of bulk water supply is the volume of water supply available to a demand centre corresponding to a given probability of flow exceedance it is typically defined by constructing a flow duration curve in which the probability of exceedance is calculated using a weibull or other plotting position after flows are ranked from largest to smallest or vice versa it is the result of matching the resource availability with demand subject to resource constraints priority of supply and infrastructure constraints bulk water supply is the aggregate volume of water supplied to a demand centre it is typically defined by the aggregate entitlements of the demand centre or other form of resource allocation for the rest of this paper when reliability is mentioned on its own it refers to system reliability as defined above the perception of the user is central to the concept of system reliability as it involves the process of defining expectations and of making strategic and tactical choices for the use of the resource those responsible for managing the physical distribution of water assess their efforts by how well they maintain the reliability of the system and also by advocating how they can improve the reliability of the systems they manage hashimoto et al 1982 playán and mateos 2006 to calculate the level of system reliability there is a need to derive the flow duration curves or the regulated supply flows hann 1977 george et al 2011c in the right hand panel of fig 1 a set of existing regulated river flows is shown these flows are ordered as a time series as they occur year on year on the horizontal axis and include any impacts from the catchment infrastructure and interventions in the river that affect its flow so in some years the flow is quite high as in year 4 and in others quite low as in year 8 and everywhere else anywhere in between the right hand panel in fig 1 the flow duration curve the left hand panel in fig 1 is determined by reordering these flows from highest to lowest and then calculating the probability of exceeding that flow in the series the weibull plotting position hann 1977 is then used to estimate the corresponding probabilities of flow exceedance on the vertical axis of the flow duration curve is the quantity of water that can be supplied and on the horizontal axis is the level of probability on the left hand panel only in fig 1 the quantity supplied decreases as the reliability of supply in the system increases in other words a small amount can be reliably supplied in more years than a larger amount system operators are typically interested in reliably supplying a certain quantity of water to a point in a catchment so many years in 100 thus if asked to provide a system with 90 reliability they would allocate only the lowest flow in year 8 in fig 1 asked to provide a system that is only 40 reliable would result in a medium supply that which would be provided 4 years in 10 with an average return period t equal to the inverse of probability p of reliability or t 1 p which in this example in fig 1 equals 2 5 years if asked to provide only 10 reliability then the quantity supplied is very high with a short return period of 1 1 years at this point it should be noted that the general assertion made by hashimoto et al 1982 and mcmahon et al 2006 that increasing supply leads to an increase in reliability do not apply in a system as the relationship between the two is inversely related a regulated system can be run at any level of reliability required those who establish irrigation systems need to resolve the level of reliability they wish to provide from the system and those who manage irrigation systems then comply their ordering of preferences about which users have priority and where those users are across the system has a large impact on the delivery of water thus the level of reliability chosen determines the quantity supplied to users these levels can also be enshrined legally as the collective users entitlement to water i e the property rights users have to water if new infrastructure or management interventions are implemented in the catchment and the flow rates of the river change the flow duration curve and ultimately the quantities of water allocated to demand centres would also change as will the level of system reliability 4 a method to evaluate the benefits and costs of different levels of system reliability what is apparent from the discussion in the previous section is that the level of system reliability can have a profound impact on the water sector as a whole the aim in this section is to outline a method that can be used to evaluate the economic impacts of maintaining a level of reliability there are both costs and benefits associated with setting a level of system reliability the benefits are derived from using the water supplied in any particular year this level of supply may be equal to or greater than the quantity determined in any particular year by the level of reliability in which case the system has not failed or less than the quantity specified with a particular level of reliability which occurs when the system fails either way the benefits from the system are determined by what is produced from any water provided to the system in any year up to the level associated with a particular reliability rate there are also costs associated with any level of reliability these come in two forms depending on whether the system is failing or not if it is failing then the costs are those associated with not getting the water that was expected from a particular rate of reliability if the system is not failing then there are losses associated with the foregone benefits as resource availability in any one year exceeds that determined by the chosen reliability level and is not utilised in that year in this analysis it is assumed that this excess water may be carried over to other years if the storage capacity permits or may become reservoir spill and is not put to productive use it would not matter if this excess water was used productively as planning and generating a level of reliability is essentially about establishing the property rights users have to water it is about what amount of water users can plan on relying upon in any given year not what might capriciously exist a simple diagram is sufficient to illustrate the physical impacts of establishing and maintaining a given level of system reliability fig 2 two different situations can be envisaged one where it is not possible to supply the established quantity that is to be supplied reliably qr as only q n is actually available the other when it is possible to supply the established quantity as excess supplies exist in the system while q m could be supplied in periods when the established supply could be provided only qr is used because the associated infrastructure was not available to utilise the rest of the resource or there is insufficient demand in the deficit situation the area b represents the quantity of water that is derived from establishing the rate of reliability and all that is available the area a in fig 2 represents the water that is not available to the system as users planned and invested on an expectation of getting qr and yet only receive q n this can be called the deficit loss the loss users experience in not receiving what they thought they would get in the surplus situation when only qr is used the reliable quantity of water is equal to area d however the quantity of water that could have been utilised was a flow equal to q m the difference between q m and that actually used in the reliable system qr is a loss of water to users area c in fig 2 it is equal to the water foregone that users could have utilized from the natural flow but cannot use because they have not planned and or invested in the infrastructure needed to exploit the flows as a consequence these losses can be termed the foregone loss of making a system reliable and once valued represent a cost to the system in this simple explanation the benefits from a reliable system are equal to the sum of areas b and d in fig 2 whereas the losses are equal to the sum of areas a and c increasing reliability reduces the losses associated with area a yet this can only be achieved by increasing the losses associated with area c it is the trade off between these two losses that is of interest in this study it should be noted that if the reliability rate were 99 there would be 99 years in 100 when there were excess supplies of water in the system and only 1 where there was not therefore over a 100 period there would be 99 cases where the cost of foregone water area c would need to be counted and only one where the deficit losses from not getting enough water area a would be counted alternatively if there was a reliability rate of only 1 then the converse would be true and there would be 99 years where there are deficit losses as it would not be possible to supply the established quantity of water and only one year when it were possible so in this situation over 100 years there would be 99 cases where irrigators suffer deficit losses from not getting enough water area a and only one year where there are costs associated with foregone losses area c these gains and losses can be turned into economic benefits and costs by multiplying each quantity by the value of water in the system and summing them over a significant period of time to determine the value of running the system however it is to be expected that the value of water does not remain constant over the whole range supplied this flaw was evident in and admitted to in the study by tilmant et al 2012 when they concluded that the larger the storages the greater the returns water users could be expected to put water to its highest value use first and with every subsequent unit supplied deploy water to ever decreasing valuable uses for example given a small quantity of water irrigators would use it to sustain vegetable and fruit crops but as they received greater quantities they also irrigate the less valuable broad acre crops like rice what this means is that the per unit value of water deployed to irrigation area b in fig 2 is higher than the per unit value of the deficit losses area a which in turn is greater than the per unit value of foregone losses area c as the level of reliability rises and the quantity reliably supplied contracts the per unit value of water supplied will rise to account for the varying per unit value of water in this analysis it is necessary to calculate the relationship between the quantity of water available and its per unit value see fig 3 in other words there is a need to determine the average value or demand function for water it can be assumed that the functional form of this relationship is logarithmic as increasing supplies of water moving from qn to qm would increasingly reduce the per unit value of every extra quantity of water reliably supplied increasing reliability from qr to qn in fig 3 would result in the per unit value of water rising from vr to vn the total value of water actually supplied in any year can be found by multiplying the actual quantity of water by the corresponding per unit value or 1 tva t qa t va where tva t is the actual value of water supplied in any one year t qa t is the quantity supplied in year t and va is the value associated with that quantity the total value of any level of reliability supplied can be calculated by multiplying the quantity of water supplied that relates to that level of reliability by the value that corresponds to that quantity or 2 rvt qr vr where rvt is the value of water supplied at different levels of reliability qr is the quantity of water reliably supplied and vr is the value of water that corresponds to that level of reliability the deficit loss or the foregone loss in any year can be found by taking eq 1 away from eq 2 or 3 lsst tvt rvt where lsst is the difference between what actually resulted tvt and what was expected rvt in any year if lsst is negative then a deficit loss will occur and if it is positive a foregone loss will occur summing all the negative deficit loss values over a range of years for each reliability level will yield the total deficit losses while summing all the positive foregone loss values over the same range of years for each reliability level will yield the total forgone losses it should be remembered that as the reliability level rises the deficit losses are expected to fall while the foregone losses are expected to rise thus the reliability level that corresponds to the point when the foregone losses exceed the deficit losses will yield the point where total losses are minimised 5 a case study the musi catchment india to apply the concepts discussed in this study to the musi catchment detailed water allocation modelling was carried out the river flows and the resulting flow duration curves are based on the same methodology presented in george et al 2011a b c while the value of water is determined from an analysis by hellegers and davidson 2010 and the average value functions specified in davidson and hellegers 2011 the catchment is located in the state of andhra pradesh india and the musi river runs through the city of hyderabad besides the increasing urban demand for water the catchment is characterised by a range of different surface water irrigation schemes downstream of hyderabad and four dry land agricultural zones with supplemental irrigation using groundwater spread throughout the region fig 4 the analysis is conducted in a simulation model that estimates the costs and benefits over a period from 2011 to 2040 the modelling suite used to generate the data on system reliability for this study consists of three models that translate global climate predictions into water availability in the system together with its probability of occurrence george et al 2011c first a series of climate data from 2011 to 2040 were derived based on future climate projections from the hadley centre s global climate model hadcm3 an ensemble of 17 different versions of the hadcm3 model have been undertaken of which three q0 q1 and q14 were found to replicate indian ocean historical rainfall reasonably well the indian institute of tropical meteorology pune india then downscaled this climate data to a 50 km x 50 km grid using the precis providing regional climates for impact studies model corresponding to the ipcc sres a1b emission scenario kumar et al 2006 downscaled the q0 climate series is used in this research second this climate prediction data was translated into stream flows time series using the soil and water assessment tool swat model a semi distributed surface hydrology model arnold et al 1998 nune et al 2013 third these stream flow predictions were used as the basis for the application of the resource allocation model realm perera et al 2005 this model is used to determine the reliability of water allocated to each demand centre within a catchment once consideration of the availability of the resource has been made together with consideration of the physical features and pre determined priorities of the entire system s physical infrastructure in this study irrigation demand is calculated using the penman monteith model allen et al 1998 based on future climate sequences and the historical cropping pattern of the region and population is assumed to grow by 10 per decade the water resource allocation model includes elements from outside the catchment the nagarjuna sagar singur and manjira projects as water is imported from these sources to the city of hyderabad fig 4 the nagarjuna sagar project is an integral part of the system as in addition to being a source of water supply to hyderabad it is also used to supply water to irrigate lower parts of musi catchment in total eight supply structures osman sagar himayath sagar manjira singur nagarjuna sagar musi medium wastewater from hyderabad musi anicut and four groundwater supply nodes are included in the model together with 14 demand centres of the 14 demand centres eight are important to the irrigation sector anicut musi medium irrigation area nagarjuna sagar left and right canals and four groundwater irrigation areas the remaining six demand centres either are outside the catchment or are used by the urban sector water is allocated in the system according to a set of rules with the highest priority accorded to domestic and industrial use followed by agriculture while the domestic and industrial uses are accounted for in the model they are assumed not to change with changes in the level of reliability thus for the sake of succinctness they are not reported in the results the monthly volume supplied from the resource allocation model was aggregated to calculate the annual quantities used in this study the annual quantities were then used to carry out the frequency analysis and reliability of supply for the q0 climate scenario the reliability results for each individual water demand centre in the system are presented in the form of flow duration curves which depict the amount of water expected and its associated level of probability of exceedance estimates of the levels of reliability and the flows that result to each region in the catchment are presented in table 1 hellegers and davidson 2010 report the individual values of water used on different crops in different regions of the musi catchment along with the corresponding quantities of water deployed in each region and these are used throughout this study to determine the value of water to determine the value of water reliably supplied to each demand centre the values of individual crops are ordered from highest to lowest and regressed against the cumulative quantities of water used for each crop using a technique developed in davidson and hellegers 2011 using the values and quantities published in hellegers and davidson it was found that in all cases a linear log relationship existed between the value reliably supplied and the quantity supplied i e p f log q the results of this estimation process for each of the zones and regions determined in this study were as follows with the t stat ratios reported in the brackets dryland zone 1 near hyderabad 4 p 88 762 16 955 log q adjusted r 2 0 62 f stat 20 66 5 17 4 54 dryland zones 2 3 4 5 p 54 337 13 017 log q adjusted r 2 73 f stat 39 27 7 31 6 27 irrigation regions annicut medium musi njlc and njrc 6 p 58 001 11 447 log q adjusted r 2 0 75 f stat 43 05 7 65 6 56 all estimated equations were found to be correctly signed and reasonable approximations of the relationship between the value of agricultural output and the quantities of water supplied it should be noted that these estimated functions display a strong logarithmic functional form and as such it can be expected that when water supplies are limited the values will be high but when plentiful they will be extremely low it should be noted that the common practice in economics is to use the marginal values of the last unit of water deployed in each region rather than the average values the problem in the musi catchment is that because of subsidies to inputs and government purchasing programs the marginal values of the last unit of water deployed in the catchment are negative in all regions where agricultural use dominates in other words from society s perspective the last units of water deployed in the catchment are done so at a loss this process is fully explained in davidson and hellegers 2011 using a negative value into the analysis would yield nonsensical results thus taking the average value of water used in each region in the catchment all that are positive will yield results that are more realistic it is assumed that these values remain constant regardless of the level of reliability they are used to value both the benefits of different levels of reliability and the costs regardless of where they emanate from in addition it is assumed that the system that is currently in place in the musi catchment does not change that is there are no technical improvements are made to it and that the variable o m costs of maintaining and operating the current system are constant regardless of the level of reliability 6 the costs and benefits of different levels of system reliability in the musi catchment it has been maintained throughout this study that water reliability is something that can be altered as a consequence it is quite logical to ask questions about what the costs and benefits of increasing reliability are and in addition is there some level of reliability at which the benefits of reliability are outweighed by its costs these questions are illustrated by observing the costs and benefits of different simulated levels of reliability in the musi catchment in india knowing that the benefits and costs change as the level of reliability changes it should be possible to calculate the level of reliability where the difference between the costs and benefits are greatest and the level at which the costs start to outweigh the benefits the results of this assessment are presented in this section in undertaking this task initially the costs of reliability are presented and then the benefits after this the costs and benefits are combined to address the questions of at what level of reliability would the costs exceed the benefits and at what level are the net benefits maximised it was found that the costs of increasing reliability increase exponentially after the 50 level is attained table 2 at the 50 level of reliability the total costs across the catchment are estimated to be rs 102 129 million at the 60 level it increases by a further rs 959 million and a further rs 7 609 million at the 70 level moving the system from 50 to 60 reliability costs rs 1 28 m3 yet from 60 to 70 it costs rs 9 50 m3 and from 70 to 80 it costs rs 17 83 m3 below the 50 level the total and marginal costs of increasing reliability fall from rs 158 702 million at the 10 level different locations throughout the catchment incur different costs of increasing reliability in the agricultural zones 1 4 the costs of increasing reliability are quite low at around rs 1 2 m3 even though they do exhibit the same exponential pattern as in the rest of the catchment in the left and right canals of the nagarjuna sagar system the costs of increasing reliability are quite high especially on the left side of the system this occurs because of the distribution of the flows in the system flows which are large in the irrigation systems and small in the dryland agricultural systems there are benefits from making water supplies more reliable and these differ in different locations in the musi catchment table 3 over the whole range of reliability levels the benefits decline both in total and in each individual region this was expected as the benefits are derived from the water supplied which declines as reliability increases the steepness of the fall is surprising however increasing with each increase in reliability the net benefits the total benefits less the total costs of different levels of reliability are shown in table 4 while only a small sample of the data is shown here only the 30 90 reliability levels it is apparent that the net benefits of increasing reliability decline at first quite slowly but at an increasing rate eventually the costs overwhelm the benefits and after approximately 80 increasing reliability is economically unviable it should be noted that this break even point is different in different parts of the catchment in the irrigation systems on the left canal nagajuna scheme it occurs quite early at 70 level and at the 90 level in the right canal the other regions do not become economically unviable however as most of the water system is centred on these large scale irrigation schemes the losses there overwhelm the viability of the whole catchment these results are summarised for the whole catchment in fig 5 the declining total benefits curve are shown to be above the total costs curve up to the 80 reliability level and below it beyond this reliability level where they cross is the point at which further reliability is found to be economically unviable at this point the net benefits curve crosses the horizontal axis the level of reliability at which the net benefits are greatest is somewhere between the 30 and 40 levels in order to obtain a better estimate of where the system is most beneficial it is necessary to estimate the marginal cost and marginal benefit functions and then to equate them fitting a quadratic function to the estimated total benefits curve yields the following function 7 t o t a l b e n e f i t s 35 9 x 2 1547 x 253 613 the estimated total costs curve is 8 t o t a l c o s t s 52 7 x 2 5087 2 x 215 003 where x in both equations is the level of reliability the correlation coefficient for eqs 7 and 8 were 0 97 and 0 94 respectively in other words the fitted curves can be considered to be a good approximation for the data the marginal benefits and marginal costs curves are determined by taking the first order differentials of their respective total functions to yield 9 marginal benefits 71 8x 1574 and 10 marginal costs 105 4 x 5087 2 equating eqs 9 and 10 and solving for x yields the point where net benefits are greatest at 37 6 reliability 7 study limitations in undertaking this analysis a number of assumptions and assertions were made that may affect the analysis significantly these limitations apply not only to the general concepts discussed in this paper but also to those associated with the study in the musi catchment it is not feasible to say that in a less than reliable year one in which the expected amount of water cannot be supplied farmers just produce a lower quantity of what they would when water was adequately supplied usually farmers will use whatever supplies they have to produce something even if it is to only graze livestock however of interest in this study is the valuation of the reliability of the system not how individual users may react to a change in reliability the ability of users to make use of the unreliability of the system should not be attributed as a benefit of that reliability to say otherwise is just tautological it could be argued that running a more reliable system incurs more expenses in operation and management than running one at less reliability in this study these additional costs were not accounted for however it is impossible to account for these additional costs in this analysis as they are not known however they should be the focus of further research finally it should be remembered that the quantities of water that are supplied at each reliability level are determined from fitting a flow duration curve these curves are fitted and as such some white noise and error is to be expected the same also occurs with the estimates of the average value functions such differences are expected to have only a minor impact on the results and do not change the broad thrust of the findings 8 conclusions the concept of reliability rests on the well held belief that it is ideal to make the supply of water in a system more reliable in this study the belief that operating a system more reliably is a good thing and whether those who establish and maintain a system should always attempt to increase reliability is questioned situations are identified where less reliability and thus greater variability can be ideal the main finding of this paper is that there are costs associated with making systems more reliable and that these costs come in the form of flows foregone as all the available water is not utilised in some years conversely there are benefits to be derived from regulation and maintaining reliable water supplies from one year to another however as reliability increases ultimately these benefits decline while the costs increase across the musi catchment it was shown that once reliability of supply to irrigation regions exceeds approximately 80 the costs associated with attaining greater reliability exceed its benefits one can only conclude that physical reliability alone is not a measure that should be used to promote and justify the establishment of an intervention intended to improve outcomes in a catchment and at the very least that the economic consequences of increasing reliability also need to be assessed it was also found that what happens in individual regions while broadly consistent with what happens in aggregate in the catchment varies enough to change the outcomes while it may be tempting to influence the reliability level in one region such decisions will have an impact on the reliability of all other regions given that connectivity between system components across the catchment authors contributions all authors contributed equally to this research conflicts of interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgements this

10956,increasing water reliability in a catchment requires reducing the total quantity of water available to users in some years in order to supply it in more years when its supply is constrained thus the more reliable the supply the more water that needs to be withheld consequently increased levels of water reliability to a catchment which reduces the costs associated with an unreliable supply often comes at an incremental increase in costs that researchers do not consider that of the water foregone that could be have been used productively if the system had been run less reliably in this paper the trade offs between the costs of water foregone to maintain a level of reliability and the costs associated with an unreliable supply of water at different levels of reliability in an irrigation system are discussed the concepts developed are applied to the irrigation sector in the musi catchment in andhra pradesh india from 2011 to 2040 in this catchment it was found that the costs of water foregone to increase reliability rise as the level of reliability rises while the benefits generally fall when the level of reliability exceeded approximately 85 where water is so scarce that it is used on only the most valuable output the costs of greater reliability exceed the benefits resulting in net losses to the system these results were found to vary in each demand centre across the catchment these results have implications for those considering innovations that improve the level of reliability in a catchment keywords water use and management water planning reliability foregone benefits catchments 1 introduction renault 2001 p 216 argued that the trade off between the costs and benefits of a reliable surface water supply is not very well understood studies on reliability in irrigation service are unfortunately rare while a few analysts such as playán and mateos 2006 tongongar et al 2008 and garrote et al 2015 have since dealt with aspects of the reliability at the farm level none have attempted to estimate the trade offs between the benefits and costs from different levels of reliability in a catchment or an irrigation system the benefits of an improved level of reliability are to be found in the reductions in the losses associated with not supplying water to an adequate level in more years while the costs are to be found in valuing the increased amount of water needed to maintain a higher level of reliability complicating this analysis is the fact that as water becomes more scarce the per unit value rises as it is used to produce more valuable crops the aim in this paper is to research these trade offs in an attempt to determine the point at which the costs from a selected level of reliability are minimised and the point at which the costs of further increases in reliability outweigh the benefits across a catchment there are numerous studies on the reliability of water resource systems two seminal studies that stand out are the pioneering work of hashimoto et al 1982 on the interactions between reliability resilience and vulnerability and by griffin and mjelde 2000 on valuing water supply reliability to hashimoto et al 1982 the performance of a water resource system was dependent on its reliability which they defined around the concept of the likelihood of a system failing or not its resilience how quickly it recovers from a failure and its vulnerability the severity of the consequences of a failure using the hypothetical example of a storage facility hashimoto et al 1982 p 19 concluded that realistic policies would have high reliability modest resilience and close to minimal vulnerability many studies especially in the environmental sphere have followed their lead and attempted to measure these concepts with some like moy et al 1986 who found that as reliability increased minimising the limits when a shortfall occurred or if the resilience was increased the vulnerability to larger deficits also increased others like kundzewicz and kindler 1995 and kjeldsen and rosbjerg 2004 found the approach difficult to estimate as an overlap exists between the three criteria something that srinivasan et al 1999 attempted to overcome griffin and mjelde 2000 working on municipal water supply systems argued that perfect 100 water supply reliability was not optimal when water development costs were high they make the point that water supply systems are operated by people whose performance is gauged by their ability to deliver a dependable steady and problem free water supply they are not judged by their ability to deliver water that has value in excess of its costs p 414 not only do griffin and mjelde go on to improve the specification of reliability away from the idea that all that was considered was a fail or not fail outcome to a more realistic one where there is a degree of failure they also valued the consumers perceptions of reliability and what they were willing to pay for it armed with the knowledge of supply and inflows into a system those who establish and maintain the system estimate how much water should be released and when that should occur thus determining the level of reliability however a range of releases could be made from an established supply everything from releasing the stock of water in its entirety at one point in time through to releasing small measured amounts on a regular basis in a consistent manner over a number of years what is not stated explicitly by either hashimoto et al 1982 or griffin and mjedla although moy et al 1986 allude to it with their assertion that an increase in reliability will lead to greater vulnerability is that there must be a relationship between the level of reliability the actual quantity released and the quantity of water withheld to maintain reliability at different levels the higher the level of reliability the greater the amount of water that needs to be held back in the system or spilled if storage is insufficient in the event of adverse circumstances in reserving more water at higher levels of reliability system operators have less water available for current use this water that is held back or lost has a value that should be incorporated in an economic assessment of reliability the measures developed by hashimoto et al 1982 are determined by both the releases of water and the uses they are put to whenever that may be thus taking a dam centric view of a water resource system obscures the fact that reliability measured on the releases from a central system are possibly not the same thing as the reliability measured at the point where water is used even if one accounts for transmission losses in addition other sources of supply such as the contribution of groundwater need to be accounted for further as griffin and mjedla 2000 p 414 point out available water is physically limited in many regions so when municipalities increase water system reliability they are shifting risk to non municipal sectors moreover if one is interested in the reliable delivery of water to a system then there is no guarantee that it will be the same at different points in a complex water system or to a diverse group of water users in reality the exact opposite might well be expected a better approach one that is more consistent with the way those who establish and maintain an irrigation system see it is to work with a simulation model where it is possible to assess the outcomes from coordinating operations between different parts of the system as tilmant et al 2012 and marques and tilmant 2013 did finally it should be acknowledged that increasing reliability comes at a cost as griffin and mjedla 2000 p 414 suggest the reliability of water systems may be too high water supplies dedicated to municipal use may be too great and infrastructure costs may be too large while this is true what tends to be forgotten in this formal accounting of the infrastructural costs of maintaining reliability which are usually fixed and sunk is that there is also a cost associated with holding water in reserve or unused if sufficient storage is not available that is the foregone value of what the water in reserve could be used for often the economic considerations are ignored in many studies of reliability vogel and bolognese 1995 p 645 argue that most approaches do not impart much knowledge about overall resource system behaviour even studies such as tilmant et al 2012 that have attempted to account of coordinating water in different storages have not accounted for the changes in the marginal benefits of that water when different quantities are involved what vogel and bolognese 1995 p 645 argue for are simple yet accurate expressions which can easily be exploited to describe the resilience of water supply systems 2 aims the aim in this paper is to assess more widely the costs and benefits from setting the level of reliability in a complex water resource system of particular interest is to assess the relationship between the level of reliability and the quantity of water available for use at each individual demand centre in a complex catchment or river basin system incorporate the costs of water held within a system into the costs and benefits of maintaining a reliable system and view and assess different levels of system reliability within a complex water resource system one that has multiple spatial and temporal dimensions to it from the perspective of multiple demand centres rather than from a single point of supply ultimately the objective is to reveal the trade offs between the economic costs and benefits of different levels of system reliability as stated earlier the costs of increasing water reliability within an existing system can be defined in terms of the economic losses associated with withholding increasing amounts of water required to maintain it at a higher level the benefits of increasing reliability within an existing system can be defined in terms of the reductions in losses associated with having a reduced supply more regularly delivered in doing this it should be possible to determine the levels of reliability at which a system could be operated where the benefits and costs are equal the breakeven point and where the net costs from the system are minimised to demonstrate the approach developed in this paper a case study of the musi catchment in andhra pradesh india is presented the reliability of flows in the catchment are derived from the flow duration curves associated with each water demand centre in the system which in turn are used to determine the costs and benefits of supplying water at different levels of reliability in the catchment once the value of water has been accounted for this study builds on earlier work undertaken by george et al 2011c on the hydrology of the musi catchment and by hellegers and davidson 2010 on the economic value from irrigated agriculture in the region in presenting these issues the concept of system reliability is defined and quantified then the concepts of the costs and benefits in this context are discussed along with the notion of finding the point where the benefits of increasing reliability by reducing the losses associated with an inadequate supply exceed the costs of maintaining the quantities of water required to achieve it finally the results of the case study are presented and the implications discussed in this study the infrastructure and operating costs of attaining different levels of reliability and the additional flow on benefits to society of different levels or reliability are not considered consideration is only given to the changes in the values of the water itself the focus in this paper is on multiple water demand centres within a catchment system with multiple infrastructure and supply nodes what happens within demand centres along the canal systems and the reliability to individual farmers and users is not considered in this paper 3 the water supply reliability relationship at a very superficial level it is easy to believe that higher levels of reliability are more desirable than lower levels after all greater reliability from any system is thought to be a desirable goal the reliability performance indicators developed by hashimoto et al 1982 suggest that in general reliability increases as supply increases this behaviour is always true when dealing with volumetric reliability from the users perspective mcmahon et al 2006 however can the same be suggested from a system wide perspective especially where the quantity of water available in a catchment is fixed over time there is an inverse relationship between the degree of reliability and the actual amount of water supplied at that level george et al 2011c the greater the level of reliability i e the more years in which a supply amount is guaranteed the smaller the quantity of water that can be securely delivered in each individual year increasing reliability must have a consequence on the uses and hence on the total economic returns to water especially for uses such as irrigated agriculture where less water provided more reliably may well result in lower total returns than a less reliable service kundzewicz and kindler 1995 provide an excellent description of the different ways water management reliability can be measured from a physical perspective they describe occurrence reliability temporal reliability volumetric reliability and annual reliability all in terms of whether a system satisfactorily performs or not over time and or on the quantities supplied and demanded vogel and bolognese 1995 make the point that system reliability is thought of differently in the us when compared to the rest of the world the non us approach is used in this study i e a steady state probability of system failure system reliability is often measured as the frequency or probability of the success of the system and is calculated by counting the number of years that the system was in a satisfactory state compared to the total simulation length asefa et al 2014 it is also expressed the number of years the flow available is equal to or exceeds a certain value out of 100 years hann 1977 ambiguities exist in the way that reliability is attached to the natural water flow available at a specific location in a regulated catchment as opposed to the water available to a specific supply point in the catchment the latter involves considerations of actual demand and hydraulic infrastructure in addition to the sole consideration of natural resource availability questions surrounding reliability can also be directed towards either the system as a whole and or the individual user within it be this an irrigator an urban user or an industrial user while these two elements the system and the individual users are related each element needs to be assessed differently with an individual the risks and uncertainties surrounding reliability centre on the choices of what use to make of their water while with the system the issue is about the bulk supply of a product called water to the system and how secure that supply is the discussion in this paper centres only on system reliability schenk et al 2014 discuss some of the issues surrounding water security and individual user choices in light of water scarcity and security it is also important to note that in the context of this study the focus is not the reliability of resource availability determined by the hydrology of the catchment alone but by the relationship between hydrologic availability actual water demand and constraints of the system infrastructure at a demand centre level that means the minimum volume of water that the system can provide at a given probability of exceedance these criteria also entail that in some years a greater volume can be supplied to the system than that linked to the specified probability of exceedance the concept of system reliability in general has been used for a range of purposes sometimes beyond that which it is intended in this paper of interest is the reliability of water supply to an entire demand centre bulk supply level within a catchment system it is a measure of how well a system performs in meeting a certain level of security of bulk water supply to an entire demand centre under a set of infrastructure and operational settings in the system the concept of system reliability of supply at a bulk level entails the notion of aggregate bulk supply rather than the reliability of supply to users within a system such as individual irrigators or household users in an urban system the reliability of supply at an individual user level is determined by a number of other factors in addition to the system reliability of bulk supply these may include the adequate operation of the canal system in an irrigation district or the frequency of pipe bursts or pump failures in an urban water supply the reliability of bulk water supply is the volume of water supply available to a demand centre corresponding to a given probability of flow exceedance it is typically defined by constructing a flow duration curve in which the probability of exceedance is calculated using a weibull or other plotting position after flows are ranked from largest to smallest or vice versa it is the result of matching the resource availability with demand subject to resource constraints priority of supply and infrastructure constraints bulk water supply is the aggregate volume of water supplied to a demand centre it is typically defined by the aggregate entitlements of the demand centre or other form of resource allocation for the rest of this paper when reliability is mentioned on its own it refers to system reliability as defined above the perception of the user is central to the concept of system reliability as it involves the process of defining expectations and of making strategic and tactical choices for the use of the resource those responsible for managing the physical distribution of water assess their efforts by how well they maintain the reliability of the system and also by advocating how they can improve the reliability of the systems they manage hashimoto et al 1982 playán and mateos 2006 to calculate the level of system reliability there is a need to derive the flow duration curves or the regulated supply flows hann 1977 george et al 2011c in the right hand panel of fig 1 a set of existing regulated river flows is shown these flows are ordered as a time series as they occur year on year on the horizontal axis and include any impacts from the catchment infrastructure and interventions in the river that affect its flow so in some years the flow is quite high as in year 4 and in others quite low as in year 8 and everywhere else anywhere in between the right hand panel in fig 1 the flow duration curve the left hand panel in fig 1 is determined by reordering these flows from highest to lowest and then calculating the probability of exceeding that flow in the series the weibull plotting position hann 1977 is then used to estimate the corresponding probabilities of flow exceedance on the vertical axis of the flow duration curve is the quantity of water that can be supplied and on the horizontal axis is the level of probability on the left hand panel only in fig 1 the quantity supplied decreases as the reliability of supply in the system increases in other words a small amount can be reliably supplied in more years than a larger amount system operators are typically interested in reliably supplying a certain quantity of water to a point in a catchment so many years in 100 thus if asked to provide a system with 90 reliability they would allocate only the lowest flow in year 8 in fig 1 asked to provide a system that is only 40 reliable would result in a medium supply that which would be provided 4 years in 10 with an average return period t equal to the inverse of probability p of reliability or t 1 p which in this example in fig 1 equals 2 5 years if asked to provide only 10 reliability then the quantity supplied is very high with a short return period of 1 1 years at this point it should be noted that the general assertion made by hashimoto et al 1982 and mcmahon et al 2006 that increasing supply leads to an increase in reliability do not apply in a system as the relationship between the two is inversely related a regulated system can be run at any level of reliability required those who establish irrigation systems need to resolve the level of reliability they wish to provide from the system and those who manage irrigation systems then comply their ordering of preferences about which users have priority and where those users are across the system has a large impact on the delivery of water thus the level of reliability chosen determines the quantity supplied to users these levels can also be enshrined legally as the collective users entitlement to water i e the property rights users have to water if new infrastructure or management interventions are implemented in the catchment and the flow rates of the river change the flow duration curve and ultimately the quantities of water allocated to demand centres would also change as will the level of system reliability 4 a method to evaluate the benefits and costs of different levels of system reliability what is apparent from the discussion in the previous section is that the level of system reliability can have a profound impact on the water sector as a whole the aim in this section is to outline a method that can be used to evaluate the economic impacts of maintaining a level of reliability there are both costs and benefits associated with setting a level of system reliability the benefits are derived from using the water supplied in any particular year this level of supply may be equal to or greater than the quantity determined in any particular year by the level of reliability in which case the system has not failed or less than the quantity specified with a particular level of reliability which occurs when the system fails either way the benefits from the system are determined by what is produced from any water provided to the system in any year up to the level associated with a particular reliability rate there are also costs associated with any level of reliability these come in two forms depending on whether the system is failing or not if it is failing then the costs are those associated with not getting the water that was expected from a particular rate of reliability if the system is not failing then there are losses associated with the foregone benefits as resource availability in any one year exceeds that determined by the chosen reliability level and is not utilised in that year in this analysis it is assumed that this excess water may be carried over to other years if the storage capacity permits or may become reservoir spill and is not put to productive use it would not matter if this excess water was used productively as planning and generating a level of reliability is essentially about establishing the property rights users have to water it is about what amount of water users can plan on relying upon in any given year not what might capriciously exist a simple diagram is sufficient to illustrate the physical impacts of establishing and maintaining a given level of system reliability fig 2 two different situations can be envisaged one where it is not possible to supply the established quantity that is to be supplied reliably qr as only q n is actually available the other when it is possible to supply the established quantity as excess supplies exist in the system while q m could be supplied in periods when the established supply could be provided only qr is used because the associated infrastructure was not available to utilise the rest of the resource or there is insufficient demand in the deficit situation the area b represents the quantity of water that is derived from establishing the rate of reliability and all that is available the area a in fig 2 represents the water that is not available to the system as users planned and invested on an expectation of getting qr and yet only receive q n this can be called the deficit loss the loss users experience in not receiving what they thought they would get in the surplus situation when only qr is used the reliable quantity of water is equal to area d however the quantity of water that could have been utilised was a flow equal to q m the difference between q m and that actually used in the reliable system qr is a loss of water to users area c in fig 2 it is equal to the water foregone that users could have utilized from the natural flow but cannot use because they have not planned and or invested in the infrastructure needed to exploit the flows as a consequence these losses can be termed the foregone loss of making a system reliable and once valued represent a cost to the system in this simple explanation the benefits from a reliable system are equal to the sum of areas b and d in fig 2 whereas the losses are equal to the sum of areas a and c increasing reliability reduces the losses associated with area a yet this can only be achieved by increasing the losses associated with area c it is the trade off between these two losses that is of interest in this study it should be noted that if the reliability rate were 99 there would be 99 years in 100 when there were excess supplies of water in the system and only 1 where there was not therefore over a 100 period there would be 99 cases where the cost of foregone water area c would need to be counted and only one where the deficit losses from not getting enough water area a would be counted alternatively if there was a reliability rate of only 1 then the converse would be true and there would be 99 years where there are deficit losses as it would not be possible to supply the established quantity of water and only one year when it were possible so in this situation over 100 years there would be 99 cases where irrigators suffer deficit losses from not getting enough water area a and only one year where there are costs associated with foregone losses area c these gains and losses can be turned into economic benefits and costs by multiplying each quantity by the value of water in the system and summing them over a significant period of time to determine the value of running the system however it is to be expected that the value of water does not remain constant over the whole range supplied this flaw was evident in and admitted to in the study by tilmant et al 2012 when they concluded that the larger the storages the greater the returns water users could be expected to put water to its highest value use first and with every subsequent unit supplied deploy water to ever decreasing valuable uses for example given a small quantity of water irrigators would use it to sustain vegetable and fruit crops but as they received greater quantities they also irrigate the less valuable broad acre crops like rice what this means is that the per unit value of water deployed to irrigation area b in fig 2 is higher than the per unit value of the deficit losses area a which in turn is greater than the per unit value of foregone losses area c as the level of reliability rises and the quantity reliably supplied contracts the per unit value of water supplied will rise to account for the varying per unit value of water in this analysis it is necessary to calculate the relationship between the quantity of water available and its per unit value see fig 3 in other words there is a need to determine the average value or demand function for water it can be assumed that the functional form of this relationship is logarithmic as increasing supplies of water moving from qn to qm would increasingly reduce the per unit value of every extra quantity of water reliably supplied increasing reliability from qr to qn in fig 3 would result in the per unit value of water rising from vr to vn the total value of water actually supplied in any year can be found by multiplying the actual quantity of water by the corresponding per unit value or 1 tva t qa t va where tva t is the actual value of water supplied in any one year t qa t is the quantity supplied in year t and va is the value associated with that quantity the total value of any level of reliability supplied can be calculated by multiplying the quantity of water supplied that relates to that level of reliability by the value that corresponds to that quantity or 2 rvt qr vr where rvt is the value of water supplied at different levels of reliability qr is the quantity of water reliably supplied and vr is the value of water that corresponds to that level of reliability the deficit loss or the foregone loss in any year can be found by taking eq 1 away from eq 2 or 3 lsst tvt rvt where lsst is the difference between what actually resulted tvt and what was expected rvt in any year if lsst is negative then a deficit loss will occur and if it is positive a foregone loss will occur summing all the negative deficit loss values over a range of years for each reliability level will yield the total deficit losses while summing all the positive foregone loss values over the same range of years for each reliability level will yield the total forgone losses it should be remembered that as the reliability level rises the deficit losses are expected to fall while the foregone losses are expected to rise thus the reliability level that corresponds to the point when the foregone losses exceed the deficit losses will yield the point where total losses are minimised 5 a case study the musi catchment india to apply the concepts discussed in this study to the musi catchment detailed water allocation modelling was carried out the river flows and the resulting flow duration curves are based on the same methodology presented in george et al 2011a b c while the value of water is determined from an analysis by hellegers and davidson 2010 and the average value functions specified in davidson and hellegers 2011 the catchment is located in the state of andhra pradesh india and the musi river runs through the city of hyderabad besides the increasing urban demand for water the catchment is characterised by a range of different surface water irrigation schemes downstream of hyderabad and four dry land agricultural zones with supplemental irrigation using groundwater spread throughout the region fig 4 the analysis is conducted in a simulation model that estimates the costs and benefits over a period from 2011 to 2040 the modelling suite used to generate the data on system reliability for this study consists of three models that translate global climate predictions into water availability in the system together with its probability of occurrence george et al 2011c first a series of climate data from 2011 to 2040 were derived based on future climate projections from the hadley centre s global climate model hadcm3 an ensemble of 17 different versions of the hadcm3 model have been undertaken of which three q0 q1 and q14 were found to replicate indian ocean historical rainfall reasonably well the indian institute of tropical meteorology pune india then downscaled this climate data to a 50 km x 50 km grid using the precis providing regional climates for impact studies model corresponding to the ipcc sres a1b emission scenario kumar et al 2006 downscaled the q0 climate series is used in this research second this climate prediction data was translated into stream flows time series using the soil and water assessment tool swat model a semi distributed surface hydrology model arnold et al 1998 nune et al 2013 third these stream flow predictions were used as the basis for the application of the resource allocation model realm perera et al 2005 this model is used to determine the reliability of water allocated to each demand centre within a catchment once consideration of the availability of the resource has been made together with consideration of the physical features and pre determined priorities of the entire system s physical infrastructure in this study irrigation demand is calculated using the penman monteith model allen et al 1998 based on future climate sequences and the historical cropping pattern of the region and population is assumed to grow by 10 per decade the water resource allocation model includes elements from outside the catchment the nagarjuna sagar singur and manjira projects as water is imported from these sources to the city of hyderabad fig 4 the nagarjuna sagar project is an integral part of the system as in addition to being a source of water supply to hyderabad it is also used to supply water to irrigate lower parts of musi catchment in total eight supply structures osman sagar himayath sagar manjira singur nagarjuna sagar musi medium wastewater from hyderabad musi anicut and four groundwater supply nodes are included in the model together with 14 demand centres of the 14 demand centres eight are important to the irrigation sector anicut musi medium irrigation area nagarjuna sagar left and right canals and four groundwater irrigation areas the remaining six demand centres either are outside the catchment or are used by the urban sector water is allocated in the system according to a set of rules with the highest priority accorded to domestic and industrial use followed by agriculture while the domestic and industrial uses are accounted for in the model they are assumed not to change with changes in the level of reliability thus for the sake of succinctness they are not reported in the results the monthly volume supplied from the resource allocation model was aggregated to calculate the annual quantities used in this study the annual quantities were then used to carry out the frequency analysis and reliability of supply for the q0 climate scenario the reliability results for each individual water demand centre in the system are presented in the form of flow duration curves which depict the amount of water expected and its associated level of probability of exceedance estimates of the levels of reliability and the flows that result to each region in the catchment are presented in table 1 hellegers and davidson 2010 report the individual values of water used on different crops in different regions of the musi catchment along with the corresponding quantities of water deployed in each region and these are used throughout this study to determine the value of water to determine the value of water reliably supplied to each demand centre the values of individual crops are ordered from highest to lowest and regressed against the cumulative quantities of water used for each crop using a technique developed in davidson and hellegers 2011 using the values and quantities published in hellegers and davidson it was found that in all cases a linear log relationship existed between the value reliably supplied and the quantity supplied i e p f log q the results of this estimation process for each of the zones and regions determined in this study were as follows with the t stat ratios reported in the brackets dryland zone 1 near hyderabad 4 p 88 762 16 955 log q adjusted r 2 0 62 f stat 20 66 5 17 4 54 dryland zones 2 3 4 5 p 54 337 13 017 log q adjusted r 2 73 f stat 39 27 7 31 6 27 irrigation regions annicut medium musi njlc and njrc 6 p 58 001 11 447 log q adjusted r 2 0 75 f stat 43 05 7 65 6 56 all estimated equations were found to be correctly signed and reasonable approximations of the relationship between the value of agricultural output and the quantities of water supplied it should be noted that these estimated functions display a strong logarithmic functional form and as such it can be expected that when water supplies are limited the values will be high but when plentiful they will be extremely low it should be noted that the common practice in economics is to use the marginal values of the last unit of water deployed in each region rather than the average values the problem in the musi catchment is that because of subsidies to inputs and government purchasing programs the marginal values of the last unit of water deployed in the catchment are negative in all regions where agricultural use dominates in other words from society s perspective the last units of water deployed in the catchment are done so at a loss this process is fully explained in davidson and hellegers 2011 using a negative value into the analysis would yield nonsensical results thus taking the average value of water used in each region in the catchment all that are positive will yield results that are more realistic it is assumed that these values remain constant regardless of the level of reliability they are used to value both the benefits of different levels of reliability and the costs regardless of where they emanate from in addition it is assumed that the system that is currently in place in the musi catchment does not change that is there are no technical improvements are made to it and that the variable o m costs of maintaining and operating the current system are constant regardless of the level of reliability 6 the costs and benefits of different levels of system reliability in the musi catchment it has been maintained throughout this study that water reliability is something that can be altered as a consequence it is quite logical to ask questions about what the costs and benefits of increasing reliability are and in addition is there some level of reliability at which the benefits of reliability are outweighed by its costs these questions are illustrated by observing the costs and benefits of different simulated levels of reliability in the musi catchment in india knowing that the benefits and costs change as the level of reliability changes it should be possible to calculate the level of reliability where the difference between the costs and benefits are greatest and the level at which the costs start to outweigh the benefits the results of this assessment are presented in this section in undertaking this task initially the costs of reliability are presented and then the benefits after this the costs and benefits are combined to address the questions of at what level of reliability would the costs exceed the benefits and at what level are the net benefits maximised it was found that the costs of increasing reliability increase exponentially after the 50 level is attained table 2 at the 50 level of reliability the total costs across the catchment are estimated to be rs 102 129 million at the 60 level it increases by a further rs 959 million and a further rs 7 609 million at the 70 level moving the system from 50 to 60 reliability costs rs 1 28 m3 yet from 60 to 70 it costs rs 9 50 m3 and from 70 to 80 it costs rs 17 83 m3 below the 50 level the total and marginal costs of increasing reliability fall from rs 158 702 million at the 10 level different locations throughout the catchment incur different costs of increasing reliability in the agricultural zones 1 4 the costs of increasing reliability are quite low at around rs 1 2 m3 even though they do exhibit the same exponential pattern as in the rest of the catchment in the left and right canals of the nagarjuna sagar system the costs of increasing reliability are quite high especially on the left side of the system this occurs because of the distribution of the flows in the system flows which are large in the irrigation systems and small in the dryland agricultural systems there are benefits from making water supplies more reliable and these differ in different locations in the musi catchment table 3 over the whole range of reliability levels the benefits decline both in total and in each individual region this was expected as the benefits are derived from the water supplied which declines as reliability increases the steepness of the fall is surprising however increasing with each increase in reliability the net benefits the total benefits less the total costs of different levels of reliability are shown in table 4 while only a small sample of the data is shown here only the 30 90 reliability levels it is apparent that the net benefits of increasing reliability decline at first quite slowly but at an increasing rate eventually the costs overwhelm the benefits and after approximately 80 increasing reliability is economically unviable it should be noted that this break even point is different in different parts of the catchment in the irrigation systems on the left canal nagajuna scheme it occurs quite early at 70 level and at the 90 level in the right canal the other regions do not become economically unviable however as most of the water system is centred on these large scale irrigation schemes the losses there overwhelm the viability of the whole catchment these results are summarised for the whole catchment in fig 5 the declining total benefits curve are shown to be above the total costs curve up to the 80 reliability level and below it beyond this reliability level where they cross is the point at which further reliability is found to be economically unviable at this point the net benefits curve crosses the horizontal axis the level of reliability at which the net benefits are greatest is somewhere between the 30 and 40 levels in order to obtain a better estimate of where the system is most beneficial it is necessary to estimate the marginal cost and marginal benefit functions and then to equate them fitting a quadratic function to the estimated total benefits curve yields the following function 7 t o t a l b e n e f i t s 35 9 x 2 1547 x 253 613 the estimated total costs curve is 8 t o t a l c o s t s 52 7 x 2 5087 2 x 215 003 where x in both equations is the level of reliability the correlation coefficient for eqs 7 and 8 were 0 97 and 0 94 respectively in other words the fitted curves can be considered to be a good approximation for the data the marginal benefits and marginal costs curves are determined by taking the first order differentials of their respective total functions to yield 9 marginal benefits 71 8x 1574 and 10 marginal costs 105 4 x 5087 2 equating eqs 9 and 10 and solving for x yields the point where net benefits are greatest at 37 6 reliability 7 study limitations in undertaking this analysis a number of assumptions and assertions were made that may affect the analysis significantly these limitations apply not only to the general concepts discussed in this paper but also to those associated with the study in the musi catchment it is not feasible to say that in a less than reliable year one in which the expected amount of water cannot be supplied farmers just produce a lower quantity of what they would when water was adequately supplied usually farmers will use whatever supplies they have to produce something even if it is to only graze livestock however of interest in this study is the valuation of the reliability of the system not how individual users may react to a change in reliability the ability of users to make use of the unreliability of the system should not be attributed as a benefit of that reliability to say otherwise is just tautological it could be argued that running a more reliable system incurs more expenses in operation and management than running one at less reliability in this study these additional costs were not accounted for however it is impossible to account for these additional costs in this analysis as they are not known however they should be the focus of further research finally it should be remembered that the quantities of water that are supplied at each reliability level are determined from fitting a flow duration curve these curves are fitted and as such some white noise and error is to be expected the same also occurs with the estimates of the average value functions such differences are expected to have only a minor impact on the results and do not change the broad thrust of the findings 8 conclusions the concept of reliability rests on the well held belief that it is ideal to make the supply of water in a system more reliable in this study the belief that operating a system more reliably is a good thing and whether those who establish and maintain a system should always attempt to increase reliability is questioned situations are identified where less reliability and thus greater variability can be ideal the main finding of this paper is that there are costs associated with making systems more reliable and that these costs come in the form of flows foregone as all the available water is not utilised in some years conversely there are benefits to be derived from regulation and maintaining reliable water supplies from one year to another however as reliability increases ultimately these benefits decline while the costs increase across the musi catchment it was shown that once reliability of supply to irrigation regions exceeds approximately 80 the costs associated with attaining greater reliability exceed its benefits one can only conclude that physical reliability alone is not a measure that should be used to promote and justify the establishment of an intervention intended to improve outcomes in a catchment and at the very least that the economic consequences of increasing reliability also need to be assessed it was also found that what happens in individual regions while broadly consistent with what happens in aggregate in the catchment varies enough to change the outcomes while it may be tempting to influence the reliability level in one region such decisions will have an impact on the reliability of all other regions given that connectivity between system components across the catchment authors contributions all authors contributed equally to this research conflicts of interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgements this

10957,canopy temperature depression ctd canopy temperature tc air temperature t a transpiration t and canopy greenness cg have much to do with crop yields and they have been widely used to estimate crop yields however the issues relating to the best measurement time to predict crop yields have seldom been addressed hence the present study was conducted to identify the best measurement time and provide a new way to rapidly predict soybean yield prediction in a semiarid environment tc was measured during the reproductive stage under different water stress conditions using a handheld infrared thermal imager that allowed rapid acquisition of high quality thermal and visible images t was estimated using the three temperature model 3 t model based on thermography and cg was estimated by analyzing visible images the results indicate that yield is positively correlated with cg and t to a certain extent however it is negatively correlated with ctd ctd and t at noon during the soybean reproductive period especially at the flowering and podding stage are effective in predicting soybean seed yield during this period each 1 c increase in ctd at noon will on average reduce the yield of soybean by 273 304 kg ha and when the average t reaches about 1 1 mm h the yield no longer increases significantly moreover there is a high correlation between cg measured by spad soil plant analysis development and the soybean yield during the reproductive stage especially during the podding and pod filling stage r2 0 79 which indicates that chlorophyll based analysis could be used to estimate soybean yield therefore ctd t and cg measurements based on remote sensing can be used as key traits to predict soybean yield and make appropriate adaptions to water stress conditions in semiarid areas keywords transpiration canopy temperature depression canopy greenness remote sensing imagery reproductive stage soybean yield 1 introduction climate change and urbanization are forcing agricultural endeavors into drier and more marginalized land and the global food demand is expected to increase by 70 which will require higher agricultural productivity with less land and water fischer et al 2010 mo et al 2017 however drought is a major environmental factor limiting world food production jones and corlett 1992 and due to the decrease of water resource the main challenge of modern agriculture is to increase crop productivity in arid and semiarid environments this consideration is especially important for cereal and economic crops such as soybean which can provide humans and livestock with plant protein but it is undeniable that these crops are sensitive to low soil moisture fenta et al 2014 kumar et al 2017 so in some arid and semiarid areas of northwest china people irrigate a lot in order to secure high production of soybean resulting in wasted water therefore we need to carry out appropriate deficit irrigation based on local irrigation options to improve water use efficiency and for this reason the comparative adaptability and yield variation of soybean grown under different soil water stress conditions must be understood soil water stress affected by frequent droughts limits soybean production especially in arid and semiarid regions if it occurs during the reproductive stage of crop growth it may have a severe impact on soybean seed yield hanks and rasmussen 1982 eck 1988 liu et al 2003 xue et al 2006 selecting the appropriate level of soil water stress to improve water use efficiency could be a long lasting and low cost solution for drought management therefore determining the minimum amount of water needed to achieve stable crop yields under drought conditions is critical for water saving agriculture and future food security yield stability in different environments is determined by a variety of mechanisms involved in plant growth under low soil water supply conditions tuberosa and salvi 2006 but using only one index to predict crop yield may produce significant error so in this research three indexes covering canopy temperature depression ctd transpiration t and canopy greenness cg were selected to predict yield variation under different levels of soil water stress ctd is deﬁned as the difference between plant canopy temperature tc and air temperature t a jackson et al 1981 balota et al 2008 which indicates the ability of t to cool leaves under severe environmental conditions mahmud et al 2016 ctd has been used for drought yan et al 2012 and irrigation scheduling lobo et al 2004 alchanatis et al 2010 various plant species have been studied wheat balota et al 2007 maize irmak et al 2000 rice takai et al 2010 cotton padhi et al 2012 tilia cordata trees rahman et al 2017 potato mahmud et al 2016 and sorghum o shaughnessy et al 2012 ctd has been recognized as a key trait for assessing crop responses to low water use high temperature and other environmental stresses balota et al 2007 and has been used as an indicator for measuring plant water status penuelas et al 1992 it has also been proven that ctd is well correlated with t status fukuoka 2005 kumar et al 2015 and many studies have been done on the relationship between ctd t and crop yield mo et al 2017 thapa et al 2018 although most of these studies have been based on maize and wheat ctd and t may be useful traits for predicting soybean yield under dry conditions kottmann et al 2013 the resilience of plants to abiotic stresses can also be expressed by chlorophyll content and a plant s ability to absorb solar radiation chaves et al 2002 the content of chlorophyll and other photosynthetic pigments are directly related to photosynthetic potential and primary productivity curran et al 1990 high chlorophyll content is a desired characteristic because it indicates that the degree of photoinhibition in photosynthesis is low therefore leaf senescence induced by water stress is indicated by the loss of chlorophyll content which is considered a promising physiological trait that can quickly identify drought tolerance and predict the yield of crops vesali et al 2015 the commonly used method for determining chlorophyll content is to use a chlorophyll meter such as spad 520 soil plant analysis development 502 which can measure the relative value of plant chlorophyll content that is the spad value also called greenness conveniently quickly and nondestructively huang et al 2007 castelli and contillo 2009 ling et al 2011 many studies have found a significant correlation between chlorophyll content in most plant leaves and the spad value greenness measured by a chlorophyll meter sibley et al 1996 udding et al 2007 león et al 2007 however the application of this method is limited because it is point scale sample data rather than field scale surface data recently though remote sensing based on color pixel image analysis has advanced far enough to provide effective large scale monitoring of crop chlorophyll content and this technique is becoming a new tool for the quantitative evaluation of leaf chlorophyll content in agricultural research li et al 2014 fahlgren et al 2015 using a thermal infrared imaging system to measure tc is an approach that not only measures the extent of evaporative cooling in the crop canopy but also remotely monitors plant water balance in this study ctd and t were estimated by combining thermal infrared data with meteorological data and the three temperature model 3 t model the 3 t model was proposed by qiu 1996b 1996a and xiong and qiu 2011 2012 and tian et al 2013 raised the research scale from a point to region level based on remote sensing which can be used to calculate evapotranspiration at various scales simply and quickly qiu et al 1999 2006 zhao et al 2010 tian et al 2014 xiong et al 2015 wang et al 2016 yu et al 2017 compared to temperature sensors thermal infrared imaging through infrared cameras has several advantages the most prominent of which are the high spatiotemporal resolution and larger sampling area the relationship between ctd t cg and crop yield has been analyzed in separate pieces whereas the relationship between combined indexes and yield has seldom been discussed and issues relating to the measurement time for the best prediction results have seldom been addressed therefore the aims of this study are to 1 study the variations of soybean yield ctd t and cg under different irrigation amounts 2 determine the best measuring time to predict yield by combining ctd t and cg and 3 analyze how soybean yield is affected by ctd t and cg during the best measuring period 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and layout the field experiments were conducted at the shiyanghe experimental station for water saving in agriculture and ecology of china agricultural university which is located in wuwei city of gansu province in northwest china 37 52 n 102 50 e the mean annual temperature precipitation and pan evaporation in this zone is about 7 8 c 164 mm and 2000 mm respectively it is one of the most prominent arid areas with a water supply and demand mismatch li et al 2015 the soil texture is light sandy loam with a mean soil dry bulk density ﬁeld capacity and saturated hydraulic conductivity of 1 40 g cm 3 0 30 cm3 cm 3 and 500 mm d 1 for the 0 100 cm soil layer respectively ran et al 2018 the experimental site and layout are shown in fig 1 the field measurements were mainly conducted on two soybean varieties c08 and longhuang no 2 l2 from june to august in 2017 and 2018 and the local empirical irrigation amount ia on each application of soybean during june july and july august was about 450 and 600 m3 ha respectively under mulch and drip irrigation we set four different irrigation amounts in each year no irrigation 35 of ia 55 of ia and 75 of ia in 2017 and no irrigation 18 of ia 38 of ia and 75 of ia in 2018 the treatments of no irrigation 18 of ia 35 of ia 40 of ia 55 of ia and 75 of ia were represented by i0 ii i1 iii i2 and i3 respectively during the experimental period irrigation was conducted about every 10 days from june 5 2017 or june 7 2018 to august 28 2017 and 2018 the soybeans were sowed in mulch covered holes with a plant spacing of 15 cm and a row spacing of 50 cm on four plots with three replications each of which was 3 6 m six rows of soybeans were planted in each replication and two rows at a time were covered with plastic film all plots received a basal dose of fertilizer before planting 300 kg nh4h2po4 and 150 kg kcl ha 1 2 2 field observation data 2 2 1 meteorological data the meteorological data such as air temperature and solar radiation were monitored by a standard automatic weather station hobo onset computer corp bourne ma usa and the cnr4 four component radiometer kipp zonen delft netherlands which located near the experimental ﬁeld and calculated and stored 15 min averages both net solar radiation and temperature initially rose and then fell during the daytime reaching peaks about 600 850 w m2 and 28 c 38 c at around 12 30 14 30 the temperature in the afternoon was higher than that in the morning but the net radiation was slightly lower than that in the morning 2 2 2 soil water content before and after irrigation soil samples of each experimental plot were collected in aluminum boxes from six soil depths 10 20 40 60 80 and 100 cm at two sampling points under and between mulches with augers the soil samples were weighed immediately and then dried in an oven at 105 c for 72 h to determine the soil water content by gravimetric method the soil water content in the soil proﬁle was considered to be the average of the soil moisture content measured in the 0 100 cm layer the trend of soil water depletion in each treatment was consistent and soil water content increased with increases in the irrigation amount but with water consumption the soil water content of the i1 treatment was close to that of the dry treatment i0 and that of the dry treatment generally fluctuated around 8 the soil water content of the i3 treatment was significantly more than that of the other treatments in 2017 fig 2 however due to experimental limitation soil water content in 2018 was not measured 2 2 3 chlorophyll content eight soybean plants middle four rows were marked in each plot and their chlorophyll content was measured at the flowering and podding stage and the podding and pod filling stage july 15 and august 2 2017 respectively the newly fully expanded leaves on the main stem of each marked soybean were selected as the measurement object the spad values at the upper 1 3 middle and lower 1 3 of the leaf were measured with a chlorophyll meter spad 502 konica minolta holdings inc tokyo japan and the average value was taken as the spad value of the leaf finally the average of the spad values of the eight leaves was used as the spad value of the soybean for the entire plot 2 2 4 yield parameters after maturity the soybean plants were harvested manually from the middle four rows of each plot avoiding the plants at the border five random plant subsamples from each treatment were manually threshed to determine the number of seeds per plant and then the seeds were dried to a constant weight to measure the 100 seed weight and the yield per hectare was calculated based on the plot yield when the moisture content of all the seeds were sunned for less than 10 the average values of the above samples were taken as the final results 2 3 remote sensing data 2 3 1 visible and thermal infrared images the visible

instantaneous field of view and its measuring wavelength are 0 85 mrad and 7 5 14 μm respectively emissivity for the measurements of the leaf and plant canopies was set at 0 95 field measurement was carried out from july to august 2017 and june to august 2018 for different irrigation treatments the plot with better soybean was chosen for the image taking and each plot was captured three times from two different camera angles about 45 and 90 the height difference between the ground and the imager was about 1 5 m and images were taken every two hours from 8 30 to 18 30 on a clear day the best quality images were selected for processing the soil crop and other items can be clearly identiﬁed from these images 2 3 2 image analysis the visible images were processed and analyzed by a program developed in envi which is image analysis software average pixel values of the red r and green g bands in each of the images were extracted to assess the relationship between chlorophyll content measured by the spad 502 chlorophyll meter and leaf greenness analyzed by different rgb color pixels to avoid the influence of soybean stems and branches in this study we chose to analyze visible images obtained at a 90 angle the thermal images were analyzed with smartview to obtain the matrix data for the land surface temperature lst then the crop and soil were classiﬁed using the supervised classiﬁcation method of the envi software and the region of interest for analysis from each image was outlined once combined with the 3 t model and meteorological data the transpiration rate of the crop was calculated finally we also find the average t and the matrix t of the entire plot view for the infrared camera then the temporal and spatial variation maps of t were plotted with excel and arcmap respectively in order to measure the temperature of some leaves located inside the canopy we chose thermal images obtained at about a 45 angle 2 4 transpiration estimation according to qiu 1996b 1996a 1999 2002 2003 zhao et al 2010 xiong and qiu 2011 2015 tian et al 2013 2014 and yu et al 2017 we can use the 3 t model combined with air temperature radiation data and surface temperature to calculate the soybean transpiration rate since the model has been described in detail we only provide a simple description of the model please refer to the above references for more information about this model the foundation of the 3 t model used in the study based on the energy balance at the vegetation surface and can be described as 1 λt rn c hc where λ t is the latent heat ﬂux of vegetation w m2 and λ is the latent heat of vaporization with 2 45 106 w m2 mm1 rn c is the surface net radiation of vegetation w m2 and hc is the sensible heat ﬂux of vegetation w m2 according to jackson 1982 hc can be represented by the following equation 2 h c ρ c p t c t a r a where ρ is the air density in kg m3 c p is the speciﬁc heat at constant pressure mj kg c tc is the canopy temperature c ta is the air temperature c and ra is the aerodynamic resistance s m the diffusion resistance of the air layer we introduced a green piece of paper on the observation canopy as an imitation canopy a canopy without transpiration λ t 0 fig 1 d because the atmospheric conditions around the imitation canopy do not change significantly we assume that the ra and ta of the surrounding canopy are approximately equal to those of the imitation canopy ra ra cp ta ta cp for the imitation canopy we can get eq 3 in combination with eqs 1 and 2 qiu et al 1999 zhao et al 2010 3 r a ρ c p t c p t a r n c p where tcp and rn cp are respectively the temperature and net radiation of the imitation canopy and all units are the same as above for this meter scale research we set rn c rn cp by combining eqs 1 2 and 3 λt can be estimated as 4 λ t r n c 1 t c t a t c p t a where all units are the same as above the only required input parameters in eq 4 are temperature ta tc and tcp and net radiation rn c which were easy to obtain 2 5 model verification although the 3 t model has been proven to be able to estimate the transpiration of various plants well qiu et al 1999 xxiong and qiu 2011 tian et al 2014 wang et al 2016 yu et al 2017 the soybean transpiration rates observed through the li 6400 portable photosynthesis measurement system li cor inc usa were used to verify the transpiration rates estimated by the 3 t model in this study on august 10 2018 three typical soybean plants with uniform distribution were randomly selected from the different treatments and three healthy leaves were selected from each typical plant then the li 6400 photosynthesis measurement system li was used to measure the transpiration rates of these leaves at about 12 00 and 14 00 the target leaves were kept perpendicular to the sunlight at the time of measurement finally the average value was taken as the transpiration rate of the soybeans in the plot at that time the soybeans with different treatments included c08 soybean treated with i0 ii iii and i3 and four other varieties of soybean jin 21 longhuang no 1 longhuang no 2 and longhuang no 3 which were represented by j21 l1 l2 and l3 respectively under i3 treatment 3 results 3 1 the chlorophyll content and its relationship with rgb pixels the chlorophyll content measured in the soybean canopy varied greatly under different irrigation amounts and growth stages in 2017 fig 3 the less the water stress the higher the chlorophyll content of the soybean and the chlorophyll content of the soybean at the podding and pod filling stage was consistently higher than that at the flowering and podding stage with spad ranges of 45 8 48 0 and 42 2 47 2 respectively at the flowering and podding stage the chlorophyll content of the soybean with drier treatments i0 and i1 was close to each other but significantly lower than that of the other two wetter treatments i2 and i3 and the spad difference was about 4 at the podding and pod filling stage the chlorophyll content of the soybean with i0 and i1 treatment was still close but the spad difference from that of the soybean treated with i2 and i3 was reduced to 1 2 which indicates that water stress had a great influence on the soybean chlorophyll content at the flowering and podding stage the analysis reveals the signiﬁcant negative association between actual chlorophyll content to average r and g pixels r2 0 77 and 0 82 respectively in the digital images captured in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum fig 4 this indicates that image analysis based on color pixels can be used to estimate the chlorophyll content in the leaf of soybean 3 2 the daytime variation of ctd and t considering the limitation of available space we present the temporal variation of ctd and t for about every five days during the reproductive period from july 10 to august 18 2017 fig 5 from fig 5 it can be seen that the daily variations of ctd and t both experienced a single peak curve which reached its peak at about 12 30 14 30 the range in variation for the ctd was about 8 c and with the increase of the irrigation amount ctd decreased that is i0 i1 i2 i3 the maximum peaks of the ctd were 8 12 c 4 69 c 3 44 c and 1 39 c respectively with the consumption of soil moisture fig 2 transpiration of each treatment decreased gradually for example from july 10 to july 15 most of the transpiration values generally showed that i3 i2 i1 i0 and the maximum peaks of i0 i1 i2 and i3 were 0 82 1 18 1 82 and 1 94 mm h respectively so we can conclude that there was a negative correlation between ctd and t that is the transpiration rate decreased with the increase of ctd under different irrigation treatments we can also draw the conclusion that under wetter treatment i e i2 and i3 the ctd was mainly negative and the variation was smoother while the t was higher in contrast under drier treatment i e i0 and i1 the ctd was quite positive and t was lower and its variation smoother 3 3 veriﬁcation with li the thermal infrared images were taken at 12 00 and 14 00 on august 10 2018 there were corresponding transpiration values available from li as shown in fig 6 a the changing trend of the measured transpiration t li using the li 6400 photosynthesis measurement system and the estimated transpiration t 3 t using the thermal images and the 3 t model was consistent and most of the t lis were slightly higher than the t 3 ts the scatter plot of the t li and t 3 t shows that they were evenly distributed on both sides of the 1 1 oblique line fig 6 b the slope of the fitting line was 0 96 and the coefﬁcient of determination r2 was as high as 0 88 the results of the error analysis of the t 3 t based on the t li shows that the mean absolute error of them was about 0 06 mm h and the mean absolute percentage error and root mean square error were about 9 53 and 0 07 mm h respectively the results show that the difference between the t 3 t and t li is acceptable which indicates that the monitoring of the soybean transpiration rate based on the thermal infrared remote sensing and 3 t model presents an acceptable precision 3 4 the yield parameters as shown in table 1 the yield traits such as the seeds number per plant 100 seed weight and actual yield y all decreased with the increase of water stress and those of the dry treatment i0 were significantly lower than those of the other wet treatments i1 i3 the actual yields of soybean with the i0 i3 treatments in 2017 and the i0 i3 treatments in 2018 were 721 48 2381 94 3097 22 and 3349 07 kg ha and 540 00 2712 12 3048 26 and 3204 35 kg ha respectively it can be seen that with the increase of the irrigation amount the increments of yield gradually decreased in 2017 δyi1 i0 1661 δyi2 i1 715 and δyi3 i2 252 kg ha in 2018 δyii i0 2172 δyiii ii 336 and δyi3 iii 156 kg ha 3 5 the relationship between chlorophyll and yield the relationship between yield and chlorophyll in 2017 is shown in fig 7 the analysis reveals that soybean yield was positively correlated with chlorophyll content but the coefficient of determination r2 was varied at different growth stages it was 0 71 and 0 79 at the flowering and podding stage and the podding and pod filling stage respectively the high correlation coefficient between chlorophyll content and yield during the reproductive period indicates that chlorophyll based analysis could be used to estimate soybean yield especially at the podding and pod filling stage 3 6 the relationship between ctd and yield fig 8 displays the relationship between ctd and yield at 8 30 10 30 12 30 14 30 16 30 and 18 30 over eight days during the reproductive stage in 2017 and 2018 correlation analysis shows that there was a negative correlation between ctd and yield at different times within the reproductive stage which could explain the effect of tc on the grain yield of soybean however the correlation degree was not only affected by the growth period of soybean but also by the different times in the same day by analyzing the fitting lines and correlation coefficients r2 of ctd and yield we found that the r2 between ctd and yield at 12 30 and 14 30 was much higher and more stable fig 8 2017 a h and 2018 a h the fitting lines of ctd and yield at the six different times over four days in the flowering and podding stage were relatively similar fig 8 2017 a d and 2018 d g however the law of the fitting lines was somewhat disordered during the other stage fig 8 2017 e h and 2018 a c and h therefore we thought that the ctds at noon during the flowering and podding stage were stable and most relevant to yield so we calculated the average ctds from july 10 to july 25 2017 at 12 30 and 14 30 respectively and also calculated the average ctds from july 5 to july 25 2018 at noon 12 30 14 30 then we fitted them with the corresponding yields and got fig 9 according to fig 9 the ctd could explain 86 94 of the variation in yield under water stress conditions for soybean at the flowering and podding stage each 1 c increase in ctd at noon would on average reduce the yield of soybean by 273 304 kg ha in 2017 and 289 kg ha in 2018 which is about 8 9 and 9 of the yield for soybean under i3 treatment in 2017 and 2018 respectively 3 7 the relationship between t and yield fig 10 displays the relationship between t and yield during the reproductive stage in 2017 and 2018 the correlation analysis shows that yield was positively correlated with t to some extent which explains the effect of water consumption on soybean yield similarly the degree of correlation was also affected by the observation time and growth period of soybean we can also conclude that t at noon 12 30 14 30 during the flowering and podding stage was most relevant to yield because the r2 rates at 12 30 and 14 30 were higher and stable and the fitting lines at the six times in the flowering and podding stage were relatively similar and close fig 10 2017 a d and 2018 d g meanwhile the law of the fitting lines was also disordered in the other stage fig 10 2017 e h and 2018 a c and h soybean consumed more water during the flowering and podding stage especially at noon so the transpiration rate averaged over this period could better explain the water consumption during the whole growth period to a certain extent therefore similar to ctd we averaged t at noon during the flowering and podding stage of 2017 and 2018 and then fitted it with the soybean yield according to fig 11 t could explain 97 99 of the variation in yield under water stress conditions for soybean especially at noon during the flowering and podding stage with the increase of average transpiration rate the yield increased gradually but when the average transpiration rate reached about 1 1 mm h the yield basically reached a stable level and no longer increased significantly 4 discussion under the constraints of water shortage and ecological environment agricultural water use must be developed in the direction of precision and accuracy in the practice of agricultural production traditional methods are generally characterized by three major indicators soil moisture meteorological indicators and crop response jackson 1982 which together form local irrigation experiences these experiences are generally good at guiding local production but there remains the question of whether the amount of irrigation is appropriate in scientific study the soil weather and crops are generally considered when making a comprehensive irrigation decision however resulting studies are often time consuming and laborious and include some destruction of the farmland system in this study four different irrigation amounts were designed based on the reduction of the empirical irrigation amount to different degrees then the relationship between ctd t cg and yield was estimated based on remote sensing methods which are simple fast economical practical nondestructive and pixel by pixel calculations with high spatiotemporal resolution and high accuracy this study also determined the best time to measure the indexes to predict yield which provides a new way to rapidly estimate soybean yield in arid and semiarid environments drought is the main limiting factor for soybean production from table 1 we can observe that the yield parameters of soybean all increased with the increase of the irrigation amount however the increment degree decreased gradually according to different irrigation treatments from i0 to i3 water stress reduced yield by reducing the number of seeds per plant and the 100 seed weight due to the fact that low soil water availability affects the amount of ﬂowers and grains under maturity which results in shriveled grains barnabás et al 2008 moreover water stress shortens the seed ﬁlling period as it results in premature ﬂower declines and desiccation of the endosperm with limited embryo size ristic et al 2008 crop canopy temperature has always been an ideal indicator of crop response to water it is determined by the heat and water vapor flow in the soil plant atmosphere continuum which reflects the energy exchange between crops and the atmosphere rahman et al 2017 and transpiration is one main way through which crops dissipate energy when the water supply cannot meet the requirement of plant transpiration the transpiration rate decreases heat consumption decreases and leaf temperature increases urban et al 2007 kashiwagi et al 2008 so a change in ctd can reflect a mismatch between soil water supply and plant water demand mahmud et al 2016 based on analysis of fig 5 the daily variation trend of ctd and t was basically the same but with the increase of irrigation amount ctd decreased while t increased this is because the imitation canopy is without transpiration tc p ta is generally positive and according to eq 4 the larger the ctd the smaller the latent heat of the canopy therefore ctd has a good physical basis and physiological mechanism balota et al 2008 for the research and application of ctd and t especially for irrigation decision making and yield estimation using the indexes many scholars have proposed a number of corresponding experimental results mason et al 2013 mahmud et al 2016 thapa et al 2018 but the best measurement time to predict crop yield is not entirely clear yet according to the analysis of figs 8 and 10 we can conclude that for soybean the optimum stage for yield prediction is the flowering and podding stage and the best measuring time was from 12 30 to 14 30 similar results have also been obtained at the flowering stage and closely after from the study of wheat and soybean grown in a semiarid environment royo et al 2002 balota et al 2007 kumar et al 2017 this may be due to the fact that the reproductive development of crops is susceptible to environmental conditions especially during the flowering stage this reproductive development in turn mainly affects the number of seeds per plant and the 100 seed weight to influence yield under varying environmental limited soil moisture conditions and poor yield may be caused by pod abortion due to stress liu et al 2004 however lower canopy temperature at the reproductive stage of soybean can improve seed firming and thus improve the number of seeds per plant bita and gerats 2013 fig 9 shows that every 1 c increase in ctd at noon will on average reduce the yield of soybean by 273 304 kg ha at noon during the flowering and podding stage kumar et al 2017 have also obtained the similar result that every 1 c change in ctd represents a yield reduction of 193 kg ha fig 11 shows that when the average transpiration rate was greater than 1 1 mm h the yield is basically stable this indicates that the local irrigation experience was high and when the water reaches a certain level it will no longer be the main factor restricting production in addition chlorophyll content and its ability to absorb solar radiation can be used to indicate plant resilience to abiotic stresses chaves et al 2002 and chlorophyll content is directly related to photosynthetic potential and primary productivity curran et al 1990 the chlorophyll content increased with the increase of irrigation amount fig 3 and the soybeans under wetter treatment i2 and i3 with high chlorophyll content exhibited the stay green feature for a longer period which may have caused differences in photosynthetic capacity and contributed to the high yields fig 7 also shows a positive correlation between chlorophyll content and yield during the reproductive period especially at the podding and pod filling stage morrison et al 1999 have also concluded that there is a significant positive correlation between chlorophyll content and grain yield in soybean leaf greenness is an index reflecting plant nutrition and health which is closely related to the amount of chlorophyll content this provides key information for diagnosing plant physiological status and explaining plant water stress tolerance image analysis based on rgb pixels shows a better relationship with canopy greenness and chlorophyll content which in turn indicates the photosynthetic capacity of crops rigon et al 2016 earlier reports have indicated that indexes r and g are negatively correlated with chlorophyll content yadav et al 2010 rigon et al 2016 our result also indicates that r and g have a better negative correlation 0 77 and 0 81 respectively with chlorophyll content and kumar et al 2017 have also obtained very similar results for soybean many studies have shown that rgb based image analysis can be used to estimate chlorophyll content and assess the health of photosynthesis systems in other crops under post anthesis drought conditions pagola et al 2009 yadav et al 2010 hu et al 2013 the ctd t and cg measured during the reproductive stage explain a major proportion of grain yield changes under different water stress conditions this could be attributed to the close relationship between the capacity of a plant to keep its water uptake high transpiration a cooler canopy low canopy temperature and canopy greenness high chlorophyll content as an indicator of efﬁcient photosynthesis which leads to high grain yield therefore predicting yield change and making decisions about irrigation based on ctd t and cg could improve irrigation water use efficiency and promote precision irrigation 5 conclusions based on remote sensing imagery the relationships between ctd t cg and yield under different irrigation amounts were studied and the following conclusions were drawn 1 with the increase of the irrigation amount the yield gradually increased while the yield increment degree gradually decreased which was 1661 715 and 252 kg ha respectively ctd experienced a great decrease however t and cg increased correspondingly 2 temporal variations of ctd and t were basically the same showing a single peak curve and the peak generally appeared at noon a negative association between actual chlorophyll content and the average r and g pixels r2 0 77 and 0 82 respectively was observed 3 yield was negatively correlated with ctd but positively correlated with t and cg the optimum time for predicting soybean yield based on ctd and t was from 12 30 to 14 30 during the reproductive period especially at the flowering and podding stage while predicting soybean yield based on cg was best done at the podding and pod filling stage 4 each 1 c increase in ctd at noon will on average reduce the yield of soybean by 273 304 kg ha which was about 8 9 of the yield for soybean under the i3 treatment when the average t reached 1 1 mm h the yield no longer increased significantly moreover the high correlation coefficient between cg and yield indicates that chlorophyll based analysis could be used to estimate soybean yield this can be attributed to the fact that t reduces ctd while the lower ctd maintains a green character and improves chlorophyll retention as a mechanism to avoid drying which ultimately contributes to a higher photosynthetic rate and more dry matter accumulation acknowledgements we

10957,canopy temperature depression ctd canopy temperature tc air temperature t a transpiration t and canopy greenness cg have much to do with crop yields and they have been widely used to estimate crop yields however the issues relating to the best measurement time to predict crop yields have seldom been addressed hence the present study was conducted to identify the best measurement time and provide a new way to rapidly predict soybean yield prediction in a semiarid environment tc was measured during the reproductive stage under different water stress conditions using a handheld infrared thermal imager that allowed rapid acquisition of high quality thermal and visible images t was estimated using the three temperature model 3 t model based on thermography and cg was estimated by analyzing visible images the results indicate that yield is positively correlated with cg and t to a certain extent however it is negatively correlated with ctd ctd and t at noon during the soybean reproductive period especially at the flowering and podding stage are effective in predicting soybean seed yield during this period each 1 c increase in ctd at noon will on average reduce the yield of soybean by 273 304 kg ha and when the average t reaches about 1 1 mm h the yield no longer increases significantly moreover there is a high correlation between cg measured by spad soil plant analysis development and the soybean yield during the reproductive stage especially during the podding and pod filling stage r2 0 79 which indicates that chlorophyll based analysis could be used to estimate soybean yield therefore ctd t and cg measurements based on remote sensing can be used as key traits to predict soybean yield and make appropriate adaptions to water stress conditions in semiarid areas keywords transpiration canopy temperature depression canopy greenness remote sensing imagery reproductive stage soybean yield 1 introduction climate change and urbanization are forcing agricultural endeavors into drier and more marginalized land and the global food demand is expected to increase by 70 which will require higher agricultural productivity with less land and water fischer et al 2010 mo et al 2017 however drought is a major environmental factor limiting world food production jones and corlett 1992 and due to the decrease of water resource the main challenge of modern agriculture is to increase crop productivity in arid and semiarid environments this consideration is especially important for cereal and economic crops such as soybean which can provide humans and livestock with plant protein but it is undeniable that these crops are sensitive to low soil moisture fenta et al 2014 kumar et al 2017 so in some arid and semiarid areas of northwest china people irrigate a lot in order to secure high production of soybean resulting in wasted water therefore we need to carry out appropriate deficit irrigation based on local irrigation options to improve water use efficiency and for this reason the comparative adaptability and yield variation of soybean grown under different soil water stress conditions must be understood soil water stress affected by frequent droughts limits soybean production especially in arid and semiarid regions if it occurs during the reproductive stage of crop growth it may have a severe impact on soybean seed yield hanks and rasmussen 1982 eck 1988 liu et al 2003 xue et al 2006 selecting the appropriate level of soil water stress to improve water use efficiency could be a long lasting and low cost solution for drought management therefore determining the minimum amount of water needed to achieve stable crop yields under drought conditions is critical for water saving agriculture and future food security yield stability in different environments is determined by a variety of mechanisms involved in plant growth under low soil water supply conditions tuberosa and salvi 2006 but using only one index to predict crop yield may produce significant error so in this research three indexes covering canopy temperature depression ctd transpiration t and canopy greenness cg were selected to predict yield variation under different levels of soil water stress ctd is deﬁned as the difference between plant canopy temperature tc and air temperature t a jackson et al 1981 balota et al 2008 which indicates the ability of t to cool leaves under severe environmental conditions mahmud et al 2016 ctd has been used for drought yan et al 2012 and irrigation scheduling lobo et al 2004 alchanatis et al 2010 various plant species have been studied wheat balota et al 2007 maize irmak et al 2000 rice takai et al 2010 cotton padhi et al 2012 tilia cordata trees rahman et al 2017 potato mahmud et al 2016 and sorghum o shaughnessy et al 2012 ctd has been recognized as a key trait for assessing crop responses to low water use high temperature and other environmental stresses balota et al 2007 and has been used as an indicator for measuring plant water status penuelas et al 1992 it has also been proven that ctd is well correlated with t status fukuoka 2005 kumar et al 2015 and many studies have been done on the relationship between ctd t and crop yield mo et al 2017 thapa et al 2018 although most of these studies have been based on maize and wheat ctd and t may be useful traits for predicting soybean yield under dry conditions kottmann et al 2013 the resilience of plants to abiotic stresses can also be expressed by chlorophyll content and a plant s ability to absorb solar radiation chaves et al 2002 the content of chlorophyll and other photosynthetic pigments are directly related to photosynthetic potential and primary productivity curran et al 1990 high chlorophyll content is a desired characteristic because it indicates that the degree of photoinhibition in photosynthesis is low therefore leaf senescence induced by water stress is indicated by the loss of chlorophyll content which is considered a promising physiological trait that can quickly identify drought tolerance and predict the yield of crops vesali et al 2015 the commonly used method for determining chlorophyll content is to use a chlorophyll meter such as spad 520 soil plant analysis development 502 which can measure the relative value of plant chlorophyll content that is the spad value also called greenness conveniently quickly and nondestructively huang et al 2007 castelli and contillo 2009 ling et al 2011 many studies have found a significant correlation between chlorophyll content in most plant leaves and the spad value greenness measured by a chlorophyll meter sibley et al 1996 udding et al 2007 león et al 2007 however the application of this method is limited because it is point scale sample data rather than field scale surface data recently though remote sensing based on color pixel image analysis has advanced far enough to provide effective large scale monitoring of crop chlorophyll content and this technique is becoming a new tool for the quantitative evaluation of leaf chlorophyll content in agricultural research li et al 2014 fahlgren et al 2015 using a thermal infrared imaging system to measure tc is an approach that not only measures the extent of evaporative cooling in the crop canopy but also remotely monitors plant water balance in this study ctd and t were estimated by combining thermal infrared data with meteorological data and the three temperature model 3 t model the 3 t model was proposed by qiu 1996b 1996a and xiong and qiu 2011 2012 and tian et al 2013 raised the research scale from a point to region level based on remote sensing which can be used to calculate evapotranspiration at various scales simply and quickly qiu et al 1999 2006 zhao et al 2010 tian et al 2014 xiong et al 2015 wang et al 2016 yu et al 2017 compared to temperature sensors thermal infrared imaging through infrared cameras has several advantages the most prominent of which are the high spatiotemporal resolution and larger sampling area the relationship between ctd t cg and crop yield has been analyzed in separate pieces whereas the relationship between combined indexes and yield has seldom been discussed and issues relating to the measurement time for the best prediction results have seldom been addressed therefore the aims of this study are to 1 study the variations of soybean yield ctd t and cg under different irrigation amounts 2 determine the best measuring time to predict yield by combining ctd t and cg and 3 analyze how soybean yield is affected by ctd t and cg during the best measuring period 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and layout the field experiments were conducted at the shiyanghe experimental station for water saving in agriculture and

are shown in fig 1 the field measurements were mainly conducted on two soybean varieties c08 and longhuang no 2 l2 from june to august in 2017 and 2018 and the local empirical irrigation amount ia on each application of soybean during june july and july august was about 450 and 600 m3 ha respectively under mulch and drip irrigation we set four different irrigation amounts in each year no irrigation 35 of ia 55 of ia and 75 of ia in 2017 and no irrigation 18 of ia 38 of ia and 75 of ia in 2018 the treatments of no irrigation 18 of ia 35 of ia 40 of ia 55 of ia and 75 of ia were represented by i0 ii i1 iii i2 and i3 respectively during the experimental period irrigation was conducted about every 10 days from june 5 2017 or june 7 2018 to august 28 2017 and 2018 the soybeans were sowed in mulch covered holes with a plant spacing of 15 cm and a row spacing of 50 cm on four plots with three replications each of which was 3 6 m six rows of soybeans were planted in each replication and two rows at a time were covered with plastic film all plots received a basal dose of fertilizer before planting 300 kg nh4h2po4 and 150 kg kcl ha 1 2 2 field observation data 2 2 1 meteorological data the meteorological data such as air temperature and solar radiation were monitored by a standard automatic weather station hobo onset computer corp bourne ma usa and the cnr4 four component radiometer kipp zonen delft netherlands which located near the experimental ﬁeld and calculated and stored 15 min averages both net solar radiation and temperature initially rose and then fell during the daytime reaching peaks about 600 850 w m2 and 28 c 38 c at around 12 30 14 30 the temperature in the afternoon was higher than that in the morning but the net radiation was slightly lower than that in the morning 2 2 2 soil water content before and after irrigation soil samples of each experimental plot were collected in aluminum boxes from six soil depths 10 20 40 60 80 and 100 cm at two sampling points under and between mulches with augers the soil samples were weighed immediately and then dried in an oven at 105 c for 72 h to determine the soil water content by gravimetric method the soil water content in the soil proﬁle was considered to be the average of the soil moisture content measured in the 0 100 cm layer the trend of soil water depletion in each treatment was consistent and soil water content increased with increases in the irrigation amount but with water consumption the soil water content of the i1 treatment was close to that of the dry treatment i0 and that of the dry treatment generally fluctuated around 8 the soil water content of the i3 treatment was significantly more than that of the other treatments in 2017 fig 2 however due to experimental limitation soil water content in 2018 was not measured 2 2 3 chlorophyll content eight soybean plants middle four rows were marked in each plot and their chlorophyll content was measured at the flowering and podding stage and the podding and pod filling stage july 15 and august 2 2017 respectively the newly fully expanded leaves on the main stem of each marked soybean were selected as the measurement object the spad values at the upper 1 3 middle and lower 1 3 of the leaf were measured with a chlorophyll meter spad 502 konica minolta holdings inc tokyo japan and the average value was taken as the spad value of the leaf finally the average of the spad values of the eight leaves was used as the spad value of the soybean for the entire plot 2 2 4 yield parameters after maturity the soybean plants were harvested manually from the middle four rows of each plot avoiding the plants at the border five random plant subsamples from each treatment were manually threshed to determine the number of seeds per plant and then the seeds were dried to a constant weight to measure the 100 seed weight and the yield per hectare was calculated based on the plot yield when the moisture content of all the seeds were sunned for less than 10 the average values of the above samples were taken as the final results 2 3 remote sensing data 2 3 1 visible and thermal infrared images the visible images fig 1 b and high resolution thermal infrared images fig 1 c were taken with an infrared thermal imager fluke ir flex cam tix620 fluke crop everett wa usa that had both a thermal infrared camera and a visible digital camera the visible images were stored in jpeg ﬁle format and the thermal infrared images were stored in irb ﬁle format the visible digital camera has a resolution of 8 million pixels up to 32 times digital zoom and can take images and record videos and the thermal camera has an image resolution of 640 480 pixels with a sensitivity of 0 05 c and an accuracy of 2 c the instantaneous field of view and its measuring wavelength are 0 85 mrad and 7 5 14 μm respectively emissivity for the measurements of the leaf and plant canopies was set at 0 95 field measurement was carried out from july to august 2017 and june to august 2018 for different irrigation treatments the plot with better soybean was chosen for the image taking and each plot was captured three times from two different camera angles about 45 and 90 the height difference between the ground and the imager was about 1 5 m and images were taken every two hours from 8 30 to 18 30 on a clear day the best quality images were selected for processing the soil crop and other items can be clearly identiﬁed from these images 2 3 2 image analysis the visible images were processed and analyzed by a program developed in envi which is image analysis software average pixel values of the red r and green g bands in each of the images were extracted to assess the relationship between chlorophyll content measured by the spad 502 chlorophyll meter and leaf greenness analyzed by different rgb color pixels to avoid the influence of soybean stems and branches in this study we chose to analyze visible images obtained at a 90 angle the thermal images were analyzed with smartview to obtain the matrix data for the land surface temperature lst then the crop and soil were classiﬁed using the supervised classiﬁcation method of the envi software and the region of interest for analysis from each image was outlined once combined with the 3 t model and meteorological data the transpiration rate of the crop was calculated finally we also find the average t and the matrix t of the entire plot view for the infrared camera then the temporal and spatial variation maps of t were plotted with excel and arcmap respectively in order to measure the temperature of some leaves located inside the canopy we chose thermal images obtained at about a 45 angle 2 4 transpiration estimation according to qiu 1996b 1996a 1999 2002 2003 zhao et al 2010 xiong and qiu 2011 2015 tian et al 2013 2014 and yu et al 2017 we can use the 3 t model combined with air temperature radiation data and surface temperature to calculate the soybean transpiration rate since the model has been described in detail we only provide a simple description of the model please refer to the above references for more information about this model the foundation of the 3 t model used in the study based on the energy balance at the vegetation surface and can be described as 1 λt rn c hc where λ t is the latent heat ﬂux of vegetation w m2 and λ is the latent heat of vaporization with 2 45 106 w m2 mm1 rn c is the surface net radiation of vegetation w m2 and hc is the sensible heat ﬂux of vegetation w m2 according to jackson 1982 hc can be represented by the following equation 2 h c ρ c p t c t a r a where ρ is the air density in kg m3 c p is the speciﬁc heat at constant pressure mj kg c tc is the canopy temperature c ta is the air temperature c and ra is the aerodynamic resistance s m the diffusion resistance of the air layer we introduced a green piece of paper on the observation canopy as an imitation canopy a canopy without transpiration λ t 0 fig 1 d because the atmospheric conditions around the imitation canopy do not change significantly we assume that the ra and ta of the surrounding canopy are approximately equal to those of the imitation canopy ra ra cp ta ta cp for the imitation canopy we can get eq 3 in combination with eqs 1 and 2 qiu et al 1999 zhao et al 2010 3 r a ρ c p t c p t a r n c p where tcp and rn cp are respectively the temperature and net radiation of the imitation canopy and all units are the same as above for this meter scale research we set rn c rn cp by combining eqs 1 2 and 3 λt can be estimated as 4 λ t r n c 1 t c t a t c p t a where all units are the same as above the only required input parameters in eq 4 are temperature ta tc and tcp and net radiation rn c which were easy to obtain 2 5 model verification although the 3 t model has been proven to be able to estimate the transpiration of various plants well qiu et al 1999 xxiong and qiu 2011 tian et al 2014 wang et al 2016 yu et al 2017 the soybean transpiration rates observed through the li 6400 portable photosynthesis measurement system li cor inc usa were used to verify the transpiration rates estimated by the 3 t model in this study on august 10 2018 three typical soybean plants with uniform distribution were randomly selected from the different treatments and three healthy leaves were selected from each typical plant then the li 6400 photosynthesis measurement system li was used to measure the transpiration rates of these leaves at about 12 00 and 14 00 the target leaves were kept perpendicular to the sunlight at the time of measurement finally the average value was taken as the transpiration rate of the soybeans in the plot at that time the soybeans with different treatments included c08 soybean treated with i0 ii iii and i3 and four other varieties of soybean jin 21 longhuang no 1 longhuang no 2 and longhuang no 3 which were represented by j21 l1 l2 and l3 respectively under i3 treatment 3 results 3 1 the chlorophyll content and its relationship with rgb pixels the chlorophyll content measured in the soybean canopy varied greatly under different irrigation amounts and growth stages in 2017 fig 3 the less the water stress the higher the chlorophyll content of the soybean and the chlorophyll content of the soybean at the podding and pod filling stage was consistently higher than that at the flowering and podding stage with spad ranges of 45 8 48 0 and 42 2 47 2 respectively at the flowering and podding stage the chlorophyll content of the soybean with drier treatments i0 and i1 was close to each other but significantly lower than that of the other two wetter treatments i2 and i3 and the spad difference was about 4 at the podding and pod filling stage the chlorophyll content of the soybean with i0 and i1 treatment was still close but the spad difference from that of the soybean treated with i2 and i3 was reduced to 1 2 which indicates that water stress had a great influence on the soybean chlorophyll content at the flowering and podding stage the analysis reveals the signiﬁcant negative association between actual chlorophyll content to average r and g pixels r2 0 77 and 0 82 respectively in the digital images captured in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum fig 4 this indicates that image analysis based on color pixels can be used to estimate the chlorophyll content in the leaf of soybean 3 2 the daytime variation of ctd and t considering the limitation of available space we present the temporal variation of ctd and t for about every five days during the reproductive period from july 10 to august 18 2017 fig 5 from fig 5 it can be seen that the daily variations of ctd and t both experienced a single peak curve which reached its peak at about 12 30 14 30 the range in variation for the ctd was about 8 c and with the increase of the irrigation amount ctd decreased that is i0 i1 i2 i3 the maximum peaks of the ctd were 8 12 c 4 69 c 3 44 c and 1 39 c respectively with the consumption of soil moisture fig 2 transpiration of each treatment decreased gradually for example from july 10 to july 15 most of the transpiration values generally showed that i3 i2 i1 i0 and the maximum peaks of i0 i1 i2 and i3 were 0 82 1 18 1 82 and 1 94 mm h respectively so we can conclude that there was a negative correlation between ctd and t that is the transpiration rate decreased with the increase of ctd under different irrigation treatments we can also draw the conclusion that under wetter treatment i e i2 and i3 the ctd was mainly negative and the variation was smoother while the t was higher in contrast under drier treatment i e i0 and i1 the ctd was quite positive and t was lower and its variation smoother 3 3 veriﬁcation with li the thermal infrared images were taken at 12 00 and 14 00 on august 10 2018 there were corresponding transpiration values available from li as shown in fig 6 a the changing trend of the measured transpiration t li using the li 6400 photosynthesis measurement system and the estimated transpiration t 3 t using the thermal images and the 3 t model was consistent and most of the t lis were slightly higher than the t 3 ts the scatter plot of the t li and t 3 t shows that they were evenly distributed on both sides of the 1 1 oblique line fig 6 b the slope of the fitting line was 0 96 and the coefﬁcient of determination r2 was as high as 0 88 the results of the error analysis of the t 3 t based on the t li shows that the mean absolute error of them was about 0 06 mm h and the mean absolute percentage error and root mean square error were about 9 53 and 0 07 mm h respectively the results show that the difference between the t 3 t and t li is acceptable which indicates that the monitoring of the soybean transpiration rate based on the thermal infrared remote sensing and 3 t model presents an acceptable precision 3 4 the yield parameters as shown in table 1 the yield traits such as the seeds number per plant 100 seed weight and actual yield y all decreased with the increase of water stress and those of the dry treatment i0 were significantly lower than those of the other wet treatments i1 i3 the actual yields of soybean with the i0 i3 treatments in 2017 and the i0 i3 treatments in 2018 were 721 48 2381 94 3097 22 and 3349 07 kg ha and 540 00 2712 12 3048 26 and 3204 35 kg ha respectively it can be seen that with the increase of the irrigation amount the increments of yield gradually decreased in 2017 δyi1 i0 1661 δyi2 i1 715 and δyi3 i2 252 kg ha in 2018 δyii i0 2172 δyiii ii 336 and δyi3 iii 156 kg ha 3 5 the relationship between chlorophyll and yield the relationship between yield and chlorophyll in 2017 is shown in fig 7 the analysis reveals that soybean yield was positively correlated with chlorophyll content but the coefficient of determination r2 was varied at different growth stages it was 0 71 and 0 79 at the flowering and podding stage and the podding and pod filling stage respectively the high correlation coefficient between chlorophyll content and yield during the reproductive period indicates that chlorophyll based analysis could be used to estimate soybean yield especially at the podding and pod filling stage 3 6 the relationship between ctd and yield fig 8 displays the relationship between ctd and yield at 8 30 10 30 12 30 14 30 16 30 and 18 30 over eight days during the reproductive stage in 2017 and 2018 correlation analysis shows that there was a negative correlation between ctd and yield at different times within the reproductive stage which could explain the effect of tc on the grain yield of soybean however the correlation degree was not only affected by the growth period of soybean but also by the different times in the same day by analyzing the fitting lines and correlation coefficients r2 of ctd and yield we found that the r2 between ctd and yield at 12 30 and 14 30 was much higher and more stable fig 8 2017 a h and 2018 a h the fitting lines of ctd and yield at the six different times over four days in the flowering and podding stage were relatively similar fig 8 2017 a d and 2018 d g however the law of the fitting lines was somewhat disordered during the other stage fig 8 2017 e h and 2018 a c and h therefore we thought that the ctds at noon during the flowering and podding stage were stable and most relevant to yield so we calculated the average ctds from july 10 to july 25 2017 at 12 30 and 14 30 respectively and also calculated the average ctds from july 5 to july 25 2018 at noon 12 30 14 30 then we fitted them with the corresponding yields and got fig 9 according to fig 9 the ctd could explain 86 94 of the variation in yield under water stress conditions for soybean at the flowering and podding stage each 1 c increase in ctd at noon would on average reduce the yield of soybean by 273 304 kg ha in 2017 and 289 kg ha in 2018 which is about 8 9 and 9 of the yield for soybean under i3 treatment in 2017 and 2018 respectively 3 7 the relationship between t and yield fig 10 displays the relationship between t and yield during the reproductive stage in 2017 and 2018 the correlation analysis shows that yield was positively correlated with t to some extent which explains the effect of water consumption on soybean yield similarly the degree of correlation was also affected by the observation time and growth period of soybean we can also conclude that t at noon 12 30 14 30 during the flowering and podding stage was most relevant to yield because the r2 rates at 12 30 and 14 30 were higher and stable and the fitting lines at the six times in the flowering and podding stage were relatively similar and close fig 10 2017 a d and 2018 d g meanwhile the law of the fitting lines was also disordered in the other stage fig 10 2017 e h and 2018 a c and h soybean consumed more water during the flowering and podding stage especially at noon so the transpiration rate averaged over this period could better explain the water consumption during the whole growth period to a certain extent therefore similar to ctd we averaged t at noon during the flowering and podding stage of 2017 and 2018 and then fitted it with the soybean yield according to fig 11 t could explain 97 99 of the variation in yield under water stress conditions for soybean especially at noon during the flowering and podding stage with the increase of average transpiration rate the yield increased gradually but when the average transpiration rate reached about 1 1 mm h the yield basically reached a stable level and no longer increased significantly 4 discussion under the constraints of water shortage and ecological environment agricultural water use must be developed in the direction of precision and accuracy in the practice of agricultural production traditional methods are generally characterized by three major indicators soil moisture meteorological indicators and crop response jackson 1982 which together form local irrigation experiences these experiences are generally good at guiding local production but there remains the question of whether the amount of irrigation is appropriate in scientific study the soil weather and crops are generally considered when making a comprehensive irrigation decision however resulting studies are often time consuming and laborious and include some destruction of the farmland system in this study four different irrigation amounts were designed based on the reduction of the empirical irrigation amount to different degrees then the relationship between ctd t cg and yield was estimated based on remote sensing methods which are simple fast economical practical nondestructive and pixel by pixel calculations with high spatiotemporal resolution and high accuracy this study also determined the best time to measure the indexes to predict yield which provides a new way to rapidly estimate soybean yield in arid and semiarid environments drought is the main limiting factor for soybean production from table 1 we can observe that the yield parameters of soybean all increased with the increase of the irrigation amount however the increment degree decreased gradually according to different irrigation treatments from i0 to i3 water stress reduced yield by reducing the number of seeds per plant and the 100 seed weight due to the fact that low soil water availability affects the amount of ﬂowers and grains under maturity which results in shriveled grains barnabás et al 2008 moreover water stress shortens the seed ﬁlling period as it results in premature ﬂower declines and desiccation of the endosperm with limited embryo size ristic et al 2008 crop canopy temperature has always been an ideal indicator of crop response to water it is determined by the heat and water vapor flow in the soil plant atmosphere continuum which reflects the energy exchange between crops and the atmosphere rahman et al 2017 and transpiration is one main way through which crops dissipate energy when the water supply cannot meet the requirement of plant transpiration the transpiration rate decreases heat consumption decreases and leaf temperature increases urban et al 2007 kashiwagi et al 2008 so a change in ctd can reflect a mismatch between soil water supply and plant water demand mahmud et al 2016 based on analysis of fig 5 the daily variation trend of ctd and t was basically the same but with the increase of irrigation amount ctd decreased while t increased this is because the imitation canopy is without transpiration tc p ta is generally positive and according to eq 4 the larger the ctd the smaller the latent heat of the canopy therefore ctd has a good physical basis and physiological mechanism balota et al 2008 for the research and application of ctd and t especially for irrigation decision making and yield estimation using the indexes many scholars have proposed a number of corresponding experimental results mason et al 2013 mahmud et al 2016 thapa et al 2018 but the best measurement time to predict crop yield is not entirely clear yet according to the analysis of figs 8 and 10 we can conclude that for soybean the optimum stage for yield prediction is the flowering and podding stage and the best measuring time was from 12 30 to 14 30 similar results have also been obtained at the flowering stage and closely after from the study of wheat and soybean grown in a semiarid environment royo et al 2002 balota et al 2007 kumar et al 2017 this may be due to the fact that the reproductive development of crops is susceptible to environmental conditions especially during the flowering stage this reproductive development in turn mainly affects the number of seeds per plant and the 100 seed weight to influence yield under varying environmental limited soil moisture conditions and poor yield may be caused by pod abortion due to stress liu et al 2004 however lower canopy temperature at the reproductive stage of soybean can improve seed firming and thus improve the number of seeds per plant bita and gerats 2013 fig 9 shows that every 1 c increase in ctd at noon will on average reduce the yield of soybean by 273 304 kg ha at noon during the flowering and podding stage kumar et al 2017 have also obtained the similar result that every 1 c change in ctd represents a yield reduction of 193 kg ha fig 11 shows that when the average transpiration rate was greater than 1 1 mm h the yield is basically stable this indicates that the local irrigation experience was high and when the water reaches a certain level it will no longer be the main factor restricting production in addition chlorophyll content and its ability to absorb solar radiation can be used to indicate plant resilience to abiotic stresses chaves et al 2002 and chlorophyll content is directly related to photosynthetic potential and primary productivity curran et al 1990 the chlorophyll content increased with the increase of irrigation amount fig 3 and the soybeans under wetter treatment i2 and i3 with high chlorophyll content exhibited the stay green feature for a longer period which may have caused differences in photosynthetic capacity and contributed to the high yields fig 7 also shows a positive correlation between chlorophyll content and yield during the reproductive period especially at the podding and pod filling stage morrison et al 1999 have also concluded that there is a significant positive correlation between chlorophyll content and grain yield in soybean leaf greenness is an index reflecting plant nutrition and health which is closely related to the amount of chlorophyll content this provides key information for diagnosing plant physiological status and explaining plant water stress tolerance image analysis based on rgb pixels shows a better relationship with canopy greenness and chlorophyll content which in turn indicates the photosynthetic capacity of crops rigon et al 2016 earlier reports have indicated that indexes r and g are negatively correlated with chlorophyll content yadav et al 2010 rigon et al 2016 our result also indicates that r and g have a better negative correlation 0 77 and 0 81 respectively with chlorophyll content and kumar et al 2017 have also obtained very similar results for soybean many studies have shown that rgb based image analysis can be used to estimate chlorophyll content and assess the health of photosynthesis systems in other crops under post anthesis drought conditions pagola et al 2009 yadav et al 2010 hu et al 2013 the ctd t and cg measured during the reproductive stage explain a major proportion of grain yield changes under different water stress conditions this could be attributed to the close relationship between the capacity of a plant to keep its water uptake high transpiration a cooler canopy low canopy temperature and canopy greenness high chlorophyll content as an indicator of efﬁcient photosynthesis which leads to high grain yield therefore predicting yield change and making decisions about irrigation based on ctd t and cg could improve irrigation water use efficiency and promote precision irrigation 5 conclusions based on remote sensing imagery the relationships between ctd t cg and yield under different irrigation amounts were studied and the following conclusions were drawn 1 with the increase of the irrigation amount the yield gradually increased while the yield increment degree gradually decreased which was 1661 715 and 252 kg ha respectively ctd experienced a great decrease however t and cg increased correspondingly 2 temporal variations of ctd and t were basically the same showing a single peak curve and the peak generally appeared at noon a negative association between actual chlorophyll content and the average r and g pixels r2 0 77 and 0 82 respectively was observed 3 yield was negatively correlated with ctd but positively correlated with t and cg the optimum time for predicting soybean yield based on ctd and t was from 12 30 to 14 30 during the reproductive period especially at the flowering and podding stage while predicting soybean yield based on cg was best done at the podding and pod filling stage 4 each 1 c increase in ctd at noon will on average reduce the yield of soybean by 273 304 kg ha which was about 8 9 of the yield for soybean under the i3 treatment when the average t reached 1 1 mm h the yield no longer increased significantly moreover the high correlation coefficient between cg and yield indicates that chlorophyll based analysis could be used to estimate soybean yield this can be attributed to the fact that t reduces ctd while the lower ctd maintains a green character and improves chlorophyll retention as a mechanism to avoid drying which ultimately contributes to a higher photosynthetic rate and more dry matter accumulation acknowledgements we

10958,climate change impacts on winter wheat yield and water use were assessed with the aquacrop model for different representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 rcp 6 0 and rcp 8 5 and time slices 2040s 2060s 2080s using ensemble projections from 10 general circulation models gcm for a site in the north china plain to test the role of crop and soil management practices under climate change simulations with deficit irrigation di and mulching were also performed di was defined as a practice where soil water content was restored to field capacity after depleting 150 of readily available water raw the chosen mulching practice had a fixed capacity to reduce evaporation by 60 simulated outputs were compared with the baseline simulations baseline period 1984 2015 the results indicate that yield and water use efficiency wue of wheat will increase under all rcp scenarios and time slices analysis revealed that winter wheat in the ncp would benefit from both co2 fertilization and warming warming will shorten the growing cycle but largely due to curbing of the overwintering period due to accelerated growth development flowering and maturity will be advanced compared to the baseline period warming will also ease the low temperature stress on biomass production the seasonal evapotranspiration will reduce mainly due to the shorter growing cycle and the co2 induced reduction in transpiration increase in yield and wue is expected even under di while mulching can further increase wue projections using individual gcms indicated that the variability in crop production would be higher for the high end scenario rcp 8 5 than for rcp 2 6 these findings imply that in general wheat in the ncp is less vulnerable to climate change than in other parts of the world in addition the expected increase in the yield and wue of wheat may positively affect current depletion rates of groundwater for irrigation however more work is needed to quantify this in future it will be possible to introduce short duration wheat and long duration maize second crop in rotation cultivars keywords aquacrop climate change ensemble projections general circulation models growth cycle irrigation management 1 introduction the future climate is expected to become more extreme e g high frequency of heat cold waves extended periods of drought intensive rainfall and variable schar et al 2004 having negative impacts on wheat production trnka et al 2014 since climate is one of the most important determining factors for crop production changes in temperature co2 concentration and frequency of occurrence of different extreme events drought heat may significantly affect crop yield and field operations field 2012 the magnitude and direction of climate change impacts on crop production are complex and in many details uncertain this is due to the complex nature of interaction among different climate variables viz temperature co2 rainfall walker and schulze 2008 that may result in both positive and negative outcome generally warming is known to decrease crop yields especially where temperature exceeds the optimum range asseng et al 2015a however at higher latitudes where low temperature is a limitation climate change may increase crop yields for instance in north america izaurralde et al 2003 and sweden eckersten et al 2001 increase in co2 concentration can benefit crop production by increasing net assimilation rates and increasing water use efficiency ainsworth and long 2005 vanuytrecht et al 2012 however the co2 fertilization effects on crops are still uncertain and quite variable within both c3 and c4 plants generally the co2 fertilization effects are more pronounced for c3 than c4 crops however the magnitude of these effects is also affected by other factors such as availability of soil water nitrogen temperature dier et al 2018a b pacholski et al 2015 this suggests that the climate impacts are crop and site specific and cannot be generalized for different regions crops thus reiterating the need to conduct crop and site specific impact assessments climate change is expected to perturb key crop processes e g phenological development and crop growth asseng et al 2015a the increase in air temperature is expected to increase crop water demand lobell et al 2013 conversely accelerated growth under high temperature can shorten the crop growth cycle which can reduce the seasonal water use tao and zhang 2013 besides elevated co2 is expected to lower crop transpirational losses ultimately reducing the crop water use drake et al 1997 these changes may also affect current field operations such as amount and timing of different crop inputs liu et al 2013 understanding how crop water use is affected under different climate scenarios might be helpful in agricultural planning the site specific assessment of climate change impacts on crop yield plant processes and crop water use is crucial not only to understand future challenges but also to improve and develop adaptive management practices challinor et al 2014 carried out an extensive meta analysis including more than 1700 research papers and concluded that the climate change impacts on crop production could be minimized reversed through adaptation strategies when evaluating the scenarios of climate change involving changes in temperature rainfall and co2 concentration considering management practices and possible changes is vital especially in areas where freshwater is a limited resource e g the north china plain ncp developing water management practices for increasing crop production as well as safeguarding groundwater resources is of utmost importance in water scarce regions such as the ncp zhang et al 2008 whether or not the current management practices will be effective in future is uncertain climate and management scenarios can be analyzed with process based crop simulation models future climate projections by different general circulation models gcms can serve as inputs to process based models after downscaling and bias correction vanuytrecht et al 2016 a few studies have assessed the impacts of climate change on wheat in the ncp lv et al 2013 tao and zhang 2013 however little is known about how wheat yield water use and water use efficiency will be affected under different rcp scenarios representative concentration pathways and different water management strategies in the ncp most of previous studies considered only the effects of climate change it is however important to investigate the impacts of climate change in combination with different water management practices in the ncp therefore the objective of this study was to assess the impacts of gcm ensemble climate projections on yield and water use efficiency of wheat additionally we aimed to assess the potential of water management practices deficit irrigation mulching in combination with climate change rcp scenarios the hypotheses for this study were i a combination of mulching co2 fertilization and deficit irrigation will reduce water use and increase crop water use efficiency and ii the co2 fertilization and positive or less negative effect of high temperature will increase wheat yield in the ncp this case study focused on a site in the ncp and to our knowledge is the first simulation study applying the aquacrop model for climate impact assessment in combination with different water management scenarios in the ncp 2 materials and methods 2 1 site climate impacts on yield and water use of wheat were assessed for the luancheng site situated at the base of taihang mountain altitude 50 m 37 53 n 114 40 e in the ncp the ncp is characterized by double cropping system where winter wheat and summer maize are grown in rotation winter wheat is sown in october and harvested around 10th of june the long term seasonal sowing to harvest average rainfall and potential evapotranspiration eto for wheat are 132 mm and 498 mm respectively zhang et al 2008 the long term average 1984 2015 monthly temperature and precipitation is shown in table 1 the sub zero temperature during december january and february limits wheat growth however low temperature is also needed for vernalization the ncp is an alluvial plain where soils are classified as sandy loam loam and clay loam the soil at luancheng experimental station is classified as loam which is also the dominant soil type in the ncp the soil is well drained and considered as best for arable cropping average field capacity and wilting point for 2 m soil profile are 36 and 13 v v respectively zhang et al 2008 the readily available water raw for plants in a 2 m deep soil profile is around 240 mm soil hydrological properties for different soil layers are given by zhang et al 2008 2 2 climate change scenarios and data the present study considered the rcp scenarios rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 rcp 6 0 and rcp 8 5 which are greenhouse gas concentration pathways indicating the expected radiative forcing in the year 2100 three future time slices representing the 2040s 2060s and 2080s were chosen general circulation models gcms that are used to project future climate differ in their structure thus may lead to different projections to get reliable and probabilistic climate projections it is advised to use model ensembles knutti et al 2010 we considered two options i future climate projection with an ensemble of 10 gcms that produced an average climate average climatology of 10 gcms ii additionally late century 2080s projections were made using five individual gcms under rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 the gcms were chosen randomly from the available options in the marksim weather generator and those that are also included in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 since our objective was to study the uncertainties in projected crop production due to different gcms but not to highlight the differences among different gcms we did not compare or discuses different gcms climate impact studies have also used infinite change in climate variables iizumi et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 however using the weather generator climate data is also useful because it can cover the unexpected variability in daily weather including unexpected extreme events the details of gcms used in present study are given in supplementary material table s1 climate data were generated using the marksim weather generator jones and thornton 2013 marksim takes outputs from the gcms with original resolution and interpolates these to a 30 arc second climate surface using the worldclim database hijmans et al 2005 to generate an average climate representing multiple gcms the marksim averages the polynomial functions that drive different gcms in this case the differences among different gcms are averaged the weather generator has been extensively calibrated with a large number 10 000 of weather stations throughout the world the data generated with marksim does not need additional bias correction because it uses worldclim database hijmans et al 2005 for this purpose which is probably the most comprehensive 1 km precision historic climate mapping for the world and is widely used in agricultural and geophysical sciences further details about the weather generator its downscaling and bias correction procedures are given by jones and thornton 2013 the marksim weather generator has been used throughout the world including the ncp lv et al 2013 the co2 concentrations under different rcp scenarios were taken from meinshausen et al 2011 and are shown in table s4 the baseline climate data 1984 2015 was taken from the weather station at the luancheng research station 2 3 management scenarios we tested four management options scenarios including mulch no mulch full irrigation fi and deficit irrigation di mulch and no mulch were defined as the surface practices with a capacity to reduce 60 and 0 of soil evaporation respectively mulch has been found to increase wue of wheat by up to 60 qin et al 2015a in aquacrop it s possible to simulate the effects of soil surface practices on soil evaporation i e mulch we defined the soil surface practices such that it would reduce the evaporation by 60 this depends on percentage of soil surface covered by mulch during the growing period and effect of mulch in reducing soil evaporation these two were defined as 80 and 75 respectively with cumulative effect of 60 reduction in soil evaporation for mulch scenario the no mulch scenario was defined where soil surface practices e g mulch had no effect on soil evaporation full and deficit irrigation scenarios were defined as practices where irrigation was applied automatically by the model after depleting 100 and 150 of readily available water raw respectively for both full and deficit irrigation scenarios soil water content was restored to field capacity after depleting the 100 and 150 of raw respectively the irrigation scenarios were defined by considering the fact that in aquacrop model used in this study plants do not suffer any drought stress unless 100 of raw is depleted depleting 100 175 and 175 of raw leads to stomatal closure and senescence related stresses respectively hence the irrigation strategies chosen in the present study represent true full and deficit irrigation practices defining irrigation scenarios on the basis of depletion of raw in the aquacrop is a unique concept because it allows imposing the required level of drought stress accurately the concept is useful to test new adaptation and or irrigation strategies as one of our objectives was to test full causing no drought stress and deficit moderate drought stress causing stomatal closure without senescence irrigation strategies we defined our scenarios on the basis of depletion of raw the soil profile 2 m in the ncp is replenished by summer rainfall thus both for full and deficit irrigation soil was considered to be at field capacity fc at the start of simulations the simulations for each season were carried out separately initializing at fc the assumption of considering the soil at fc at the start of simulations is realistic because more than 70 of total annual rainfall occurs during the summer months leaving soils fully replenished after the harvest of maize if the rainfall is insufficient a soaking irrigation is applied and soil is brought to fc before the start of seedbed preparation for winter wheat soaking irrigation is applied to avoid lower germination rate and delayed emergence we also found that no substantial change is expected in rainfall amount and pattern under future climate scenarios for our study site fig 2 hence both for baseline period and future climate scenarios simulations for each season were initialized at fc 2 4 model climate and management effects were assessed using the aquacrop model aquacrop is a multi crop 10 water driven crop simulation model li et al 2016 steduto et al 2009 vanuytrecht et al 2014 zhuo et al 2016 that has been widely used for many crops including winter wheat in china huang et al 2017 iqbal et al 2014 jin et al 2017 2018 qin et al 2015b xing et al 2017 since aquacrop is a water driven model it has been used in numerous studies to evaluate and design irrigation practices and to help agricultural water management zhang et al 2013 zhuo et al 2016 aquacrop also allows simulating under climate change and has been used to simulate the effects of elevated temperature and co2 fertilization muluneh et al 2015 shrestha and shrestha 2016 vanuytrecht et al 2011 aquacrop model has been tested with multi crop and multi site free air co2 enrichment face experimental datasets and has proved excellent in simulating the effects of elevated co2 on biomass and grain yield r2 0 90 vanuytrecht et al 2011 aquacrop also considers the effects of temperature stress cold and heat on biomass production that is specified by a stress coefficient ks for example for low temperature stress the ks vary between 0 and 1 with 1 indicating no stress on biomass production the shape of the curve between 0 and 1 is logistic the upper and lower thresholds of ks curve are defined in terms of growing degree days gdds per day daily mean temperatures were used to calculate the gdds while the base tbase and upper tupp temperatures for calculating the gdds were 0 ºc and 26 ºc respectively in the present study the upper and lower thresholds for cold stress were fixed at 10 and 0 gdds day 1 respectively where 10 being the minimum gdds required for full biomass production aquacrop is relatively simple but very robust in simulating different plant processes steduto et al 2009 detailed model structure and equations are given by raes et al 2009 aquacrop has previously been calibrated and tested under different irrigation treatments in the ncp iqbal et al 2014 however we re calibrated and validated the model using field data from the luancheng agro ecosystem experimental station aquacrop uses six input files i e climate crop soil management irrigation and initial conditions there are both conservative and less conservative parameters the conservative parameters can be fixed as default however the non conservative parameters need to be updated depending on crop cultivar site or management in this study the less conservative parameters that are cultivar and management specific were carefully adjusted the parameter values used in this process were taken from multiple sources including field measurements local experience and literature supplementary material table s2 the parameters that cannot be easily measured were calibrated with trial and error method supplementary material table s2 the field observations on grain yield final biomass and soil water content were available from the luancheng experimental station the data used for calibration and validation of the model is from a long term irrigation experiment the experiment included different irrigation treatments where efforts were made to avoid any other stresses e g crop was well fertilized and pest weeds insects and diseases attacks were minimized using manual and chemical approaches more details about the experiment crop husbandry and data are given by zhang et al 2017 the data used included two separate sets of 10 independent experimental units viz 5 irrigation treatments 2 years the irrigation treatments varied in frequency and amount of watering starting from rainfed with no supplementary irrigation to well watered with 5 supplementary irrigations zhang et al 2017 since the model was going to be used for full deficit irrigation scenarios the calibration validation datasets also included different treatments that varied in irrigation amounts ranging from deficit to well watered the data from 2007 08 and 2009 10 seasons was used for calibration while 2010 11 and 2011 12 seasons were used for validation of the model no other stress e g nutrient salinity and pests was considered while calibrating validating the model the model was calibrated manually where simulations were compared with observations followed by updating the model parameters to improve model performance model performance was evaluated with a number of statistics viz normalized root mean square error nrmse eq 1 mean absolute error mae eq 2 and percent deviation pd eq 3 where si and mi are simulated and measured values and m is mean of measured values the nrmse values lower than 20 indicates a good model performance jamieson et al 1991 while the mae and pd values close to zero indicate better performance 1 n r m s e s i m i 2 n x 100 m 2 m a e 1 n s i m i 3 p e r c e n t d e v i a t i o n s i m u l a t e d m e a s u r e d 100 m e a s u r

aquacrop the climate and management scenarios were analysed for 48 scenario combinations including four rcps two irrigation strategies two mulching levels and three time slices the simulations for the baseline period were run for the period 1984 to 2015 considering full irrigation with no mulch in order to separate the temperature and co2 fertilization effects additional simulations were performed with future climate and baseline 1984 2015 average co2 concentration 370 ppm the variability in future projections due to different gcms was assessed for the late century time slice 2080s using the climate data from five individual gcms under rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 the impacts of climate change and co2 fertilization are presented as average change from the baseline period the difference between the future and baseline periods was calculated for grain yield water use efficiency and crop evapotranspiration and results are shown as average percent deviation 3 results 3 1 model evaluation the model validation results showed very good agreement between the measured and simulated grain yield of wheat fig 1 the statistical indices in fig 1 confirms the good model performance for independent datasets including five irrigation treatments and two seasons 2010 11 2011 12 the simulated yield of winter wheat averaged over the baseline period 1984 2015 was 7 7 0 5 t ha 1 which corresponded well with the measured average yield 6 0 1 1 t ha 1 agricultural yearbook of luancheng county and 6 5 1 0 t ha 1 luancheng experimental station the model slightly overestimated the observed yields however it should be noticed that yield measured at the experimental station and especially from the farmer s field is affected by additional yield reducing factors e g diseases and pests that are generally not accounted for in the model model performance for simulating the time taken to flowering was also very good viz nmrse 1 16 days mae 1 50 days and percent deviation 0 23 3 2 climate projections ensemble projections average climatology of 10 gcms agree on future temperature rise under all rcp scenarios fig 2 the expected increase in temperature will be higher towards the end of the 21st century except for rcp 2 6 which will result in slight increase followed by a slight decrease the projected increase will be higher in minimum than maximum temperature ensemble projections indicated no substantial difference in seasonal october to may rainfall comparing the future and baseline periods for winter wheat in the ncp fig 2 3 3 climate impacts 3 3 1 grain yield and related processes climate impacts including co2 fertilization effects and changes in rainfall on wheat yield are given in fig 3 the wheat yield is expected to increase with impacts varying with rcp scenarios and timeline compared with the baseline period 1984 2015 the wheat yield during the 2040s 2060s and 2080s is projected to increase with the range varying from 24 to 56 fig 3 full irrigation with no mulch the yield is expected to increase even when co2 fertilization effects are ignored fig 4 the contribution of co2 fertilization was highest under high concentration scenarios rcp 6 0 rcp 8 5 for the late century time slice 2080s comparing the results presented in figs 3 and 4 indicate that the contribution of co2 fertilization in increasing wheat yield could vary between 10 and 32 depending on the rcp scenarios and timeline the wheat growth period is expected to shorten between 8 19 days and 18 43 days when compared with the baseline period fig 5 the low temperature stress affecting the biomass production will also decrease considerably under climate change fig 6 3 3 2 water use and water use efficiency the seasonal planting to maturity evapotranspiration of wheat is expected to decrease compared to the baseline period the seasonal transpiration with co2 fertilization is expected to decrease between 10 and 27 depending on the rcp scenarios and timeline fig 7 full irrigation without mulch the reduction in transpiration is likely even without co2 fertilization beccause of shortening of growing season however the extent will be lower supplementary material fig s1 the evaporation was projected to either remain unaffected or vary marginally from the baseline 6 except rcp 8 5 2080s fig 8 full irrigation without mulch the reduction in evapotranspiration together with the positive effect on yield will increase water use efficiency wue of wheat under all rcp scenarios fig 9 full irrigation without mulch the increase in wue with without co2 fertilization will vary between 36 21 and 109 52 under different rcp scenarios and future times slices figs 9 10 3 4 climate change effects under deficit irrigation and mulching analysis of the management scenarios involving deficit irrigation and mulching indicated that these practices could be useful in sustaining yield and increasing wue of wheat under climate change applying mulch with full irrigation did not significantly affect simulated grain yield 6 vs no mulch fig 3 however the contribution of mulch in increasing wue under full irrigation varied between 15 and 40 fig 9 primarily due to lower evaporation fig 8 furthermore the increase in grain yield under deficit irrigation no mulch was nearly the same 7 with di as under full irrigation fig 3 however the wue did increase 3 15 fig 9 the contribution of mulch in increasing wue under deficit irrigation varied between 13 and 29 fig 9 the amount of irrigation applied under different rcp scenarios time slices and management scenarios is presented in supplementary material supplementary material table s3 the irrigation demand was considerably lower under di with mulch for all rcp scenarios the average irrigation demand under full irrigation treatment was also lower supplementary material table s3 than the average amount of irrigation applied under baseline simulations with full irrigation 242 mm 3 5 variability in projected crop production due to gcms the projected variation in crop production due to different gcms was higher for the high end scenario rcp 8 5 2080s compared to low concentration scenario rcp 2 6 fig 11 the projected increase in grain yield under rcp 8 5 varied between 31 and 51 due to different gcms however this variation was lower yield increase range 21 29 under rcp 2 6 fig 11a likewise the variation in the projected wue fig 11b and growth cycle fig 11c due to different gcms was lower under rcp 2 6 than under rcp 8 5 these results highlight the differences among different gcms to project future climate that ultimately affects the impact assessments 4 discussion climate change is generally characterized by changes in temperature rainfall patterns and co2 concentration its impact on crop production and especially the interaction among the abovementioned variables is complex walker and schulze 2008 with possibility of both beneficial and harmful effects asseng et al 2013 studies considering the temperature increase have indicated that the wheat production can be negatively affected under climate change asseng et al 2011 if temperature exceeds the optimum range ortiz et al 2008 however the increase in co2 concentration is known to have positive effects on all c3 crops including wheat ainsworth and long 2005 we found that the wheat yield at our study site luancheng ncp is projected to increase in future under all rcp scenarios fig 3 previous studies have shown that yield of some crops or crops in specific regions might be positively affected by climate change for instance grain yield of wheat has been reported to increase under climate change mainly in the areas where low temperature is a limitation such as in sweden eckersten et al 2001 northern china tao and zhang 2013 and northern america izaurralde et al 2003 recent studies involving multi method assessments by liu et al 2016 and zhao et al 2017 revealed that the effects of increased temperature on wheat yield in china are less severe than in other regions a number of other climate impact studies have also demonstrated the positive effect of climate change on wheat in the ncp guo et al 2010 lv et al 2013 tao and zhang 2013 the wheat yield at our study site would benefit from both the increase in temperature and co2 fertilization the positive effects of co2 fertilization on crop growth and yield are generally known especially for c3 crops ainsworth and long 2005 amthor 2001 kimball et al 2002 we showed that the co2 fertilization contributed to yield increase by between 10 and 32 depending on different rcp scenarios and timeline figs 3 4 in agreement with our findings a previous modelling study showed that the co2 fertilization could contribute up to 40 to yield increase in different parts of ncp tao and zhang 2013 a three year free air carbon dioxide enrichment face field study showed that elevated co2 can increase wheat yield up to 10 however the grain quality was negatively affected when compared with the ambient co2 concentration högy and fangmeier 2008 högy et al 2009 other experimental studies by fangmeier et al 1996 and schütz and fangmeier 2001 also indicated that elevated co2 can increase wheat grain yield by 34 and 45 respectively likewise dubey et al 2015 analysed the results from 82 experiments and concluded that elevated co2 is expected to increase yield of wheat through positive effects on growth development and net assimilation rate however the positive effects of elevated co2 are likely less prominent if combined with other adverse factors under climate change e g drought heat nutrient deficiency dier et al 2018a b dubey et al 2015 manderscheid et al 2014 the sensitivity of plants to other abiotic stresses i e drought is also expected to change at elevated co2 concentration gray et al 2016 yan et al 2017 thereby adding additional uncertainities the long term adaptation of plants to elevated co2 and how that will affect crop production is also uncertain ainsworth and long 2005 inspite of this the results from present study and previous experiental and modelling studies indicate that wheat in general will benefit from elevated co2 under climate change in addition to the positive effeects of co2 fertilization the wheat yield at our study site also benefited from the temperature increase among the processes affecting yield under climate change the shortening of the growing cycle especially the grain filling period is crucial and has been reported to be the main reason affecting grain yield asseng et al 2015a however despite considerable shorter total growth cycle fig 5 we showed that wheat yield would increase with climate change in the ncp this is because the grain filling duration is expected to remain unaffected supplementary material fig s2 the reduction in the growing cycle was largely due to shortening of overwintering period tao and zhang 2013 also carried out modelling assessment and found that the shortening of the growing cycle of wheat under climate change is due to shorter vegetative phase while the reproductive phase remains unaffected in the ncp relatively shorter vegetative compared to reproductive phase has also been reported from long term warming experiments at the luancheng station ncp liu et al 2013 moreover due to accelerated growth the flowering and maturity can be reached earlier than for the baseline period that may also help to avoid high temperatures in summer supplementary material fig s2 our analysis showed that the increase in temperature will ease the low temperature stress on biomass production of wheat that in return may have an overall positive effect on grain yield conversely tan et al 2018 studied the combined effects of elevated daily mean temperature 2 5 2 8 c and co2 concentration 600 ppm in an open top chamber experiment and reported that the grain yield of wheat decreases in the ncp interestingly they associated the effects to low temperature arguing that elevated temperature accelerated plant growth and exposed the critical developmental stages flowering to a cooler temperature nonetheless our study results in agreement with others studies indicate that winter wheat in the ncp will benefit from both co2 fertilization and warming apart from the effects on crop growth developmental and yield warming is expected to increase the water use evapotranspiration et liu et al 2013 lobell et al 2013 on the contrary the expected reduction in growing cycle and co2 fertilization can decrease seasonal water use lv et al 2013 in addition accelerated growth and early harvest of wheat may also avoid the hot dry periods in late may and early june ultimately reducing the overall crop water demand we showed that the changes in evaporation over the wheat growing season were only marginal when compared with the baseline period fig 8 a substantial reduction in seasonal transpiration fig 7 together with a considerable increase in grain yield increased wue under all rcp scenarios and time slices fig 9 using the modelling approach guo et al 2010 studied the effects of climate change on wheat yield and water use in the ncp and reported that the et of wheat might decrease under a2a and a1b emission scenarios they also reported substantial 40 increase in wue of wheat under climate change in another modelling study lv et al 2013 reported a slight increase 4 8 in et between 2030s and 2070s under different emission scenarios a2 a1 and b1 however the increase in yield was higher 17 26 which increased wue likewise tao and zhang 2013 carried out super ensemble based projections for the whole ncp and reported that the seasonal et might increase by 5 8 a substantial increase in yield will increase wue of wheat climate change induced increase in wue of wheat has been shown in present and other modelling studies guo et al 2010 tao and zhang 2013 analysis of long term experimental data 1983 2010 has also shown that changes in temperature and precipitation significantly increased wue of wheat from 1983 to 2010 zhang et al 2015 despite all the reported positive effects of climate change on wue there also exists sizeable uncertainty in both crop yield and water use under climate change scenarios guo et al 2010 xiao et al 2018 moreover experimental studies have shown that wheat yield and wue can also decrease due to warming driven increase in evaporative water losses and reduced water availability hence it s vital that while reporting the positive effects of climate change on wue the associated uncertainties should also be discussed the irrigation demand based on water use for wheat is expected to decrease under all rcp scenarios the amount of water applied to restore the soil water content to field capacity under different management and climate rcp scenarios indicate a reduction in irrigation demand supplementary material table s3 the demand will further decrease from rcp 2 6 to rcp 8 5 but mainly under di with and without mulch the role of climate change in affecting the irrigation demand will be due to both temperature and co2 the seasonal transpiration is expected to decrease fig 7 because high co2 concentration under different rcp scenarios meinshausen et al 2011 will decrease stomatal opening and thereby leaf conductance drake et al 1997 besides due to accelerated growth the growth cycle will shorten and the crop would avoid the late may and early june supplementary fig s2 which can reduce water use because the atmospheric demand during this period is generally very high the interaction between management and climate scenarios can further sustain crop production and water resources in the ncp because the di and mulching would reduce irrigation demand due to lower transpiration water stress induced stomatal closure fig 7 and evaporation mulch effect fig 8 it should be noticed that the irrigation amounts presented in supplementary table s3 are the average multiple seasons amounts applied to restore the soil water content to field capacity after depleting 100 full irrigation and 150 deficit irrigation of readily available water the irrigation demand under different management and rcp scenarios could also be assessed comparing the total amount of water used in evapotranspiration during the whole season figs 7 and 8 the expected reduction in crop water use evapotranspiration could be helpful to restore and or reduce the groundwater depletion rates in the ncp the present study indicates that adopting di with mulch may significantly reduce irrigation demand and thus could be helpful to reduce groundwater extraction in future we only considered one site luancheng in this study however more work is needed to assess the potential for the whole region apart from management other adaptation measures should also be considered recently research focus has shifted towards changing the cropping system intensity where alternative crop rotation options have been investigated modelling studies have indicated that reducing the cropping intensity 3 crops in two years can help bringing sustainability in water use xiao et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 nevertheless more experimental work is needed to explore the viable adaptation measures climate change impacts on crop production have been studied through a range of methodologies including experimental modelling and analytical approaches the process based crop simulation models are used for long term climate impact assessments and can also provide useful information regarding the upcoming challenge and possible adaption measures vanuytrecht et al 2016 the main issue with modelling studies is uncertainty in impact assessments that may arise due to the limited knowledge of complex biophysical processes model s ability to reproduce the biophysical processes accuracy of input data and limited information on local practices zampieri et al 2018 the climate models that are used to project future climate also differ in their structure which may result in different projections even when starting with same driving scenarios knutti et al 2010 the use of crop asseng et al 2015b and climate knutti et al 2010 model ensembles has been suggested as an option to get probabilistic projections however despite having limitations to reproduce all biophysical responses robust crop models can still be used to assess the relations between yield and climate anomalies lobell et al 2013 and to project the impacts of climate change on crop production muluneh et al 2015 vanuytrecht et al 2016 the approach used in present study is standard where gcms were used to project future climate while the climate change effects were assessed with a simple but robust crop simulation model aquacrop although we did not use an ensemble of crop models the simulated impacts on wheat production in the ncp were fairly comparable with other studies using complex crop simulation models guo et al 2010 mo et al 2009 multi model super ensembles tao and zhang 2013 and multi method approaches liu et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 an advantage of using aquacrop is that it is simple but robust requiring less input data than many other models raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 vanuytrecht et al 2014 in addition it provides an option to assess the climate change effects under different management practices which can also be used to design adaption measures 5 conclusions analysis with the aquacrop model involving the effects of temperature co2 and rainfall changes showed that the wheat yield is expected to increase in the ncp under all rcp scenarios wheat in the ncp is expected to benefit from both the increase in temperature and co2 fertilization the total growing cycle of wheat is expected to decrease under climate change however the actual grain filling duration will not be affected moreover the elevated temperature is expected to ease the low temperature stress on biomass production during the winter the seasonal et is expected to decrease mainly due to a high co2 induced reduction in transpiration and shortened growing cycle reduced et together with an increase in yield are expected to increase wue of wheat the variability in the projections due to different general circulation models is higher for high end scenario rcp 8 5 2080s assessment of mulching and deficit irrigation under different rcp scenarios showed that these practices could sustain grain yield and increase wue of wheat in the ncp acknowledgements financial

10958,climate change impacts on winter wheat yield and water use were assessed with the aquacrop model for different representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 rcp 6 0 and rcp 8 5 and time slices 2040s 2060s 2080s using ensemble projections from 10 general circulation models gcm for a site in the north china plain to test the role of crop and soil management practices under climate change simulations with deficit irrigation di and mulching were also performed di was defined as a practice where soil water content was restored to field capacity after depleting 150 of readily available water raw the chosen mulching practice had a fixed capacity to reduce evaporation by 60 simulated outputs were compared with the baseline simulations baseline period 1984 2015 the results indicate that yield and water use efficiency wue of wheat will increase under all rcp scenarios and time slices analysis revealed that winter wheat in the ncp would benefit from both co2 fertilization and warming warming will shorten the growing cycle but largely due to curbing of the overwintering period due to accelerated growth development flowering and maturity will be advanced compared to the baseline period warming will also ease the low temperature stress on biomass production the seasonal evapotranspiration will reduce mainly due to the shorter growing cycle and the co2 induced reduction in transpiration increase in yield and wue is expected even under di while mulching can further increase wue projections using individual gcms indicated that the variability in crop production would be higher for the high end scenario rcp 8 5 than for rcp 2 6 these findings imply that in general wheat in the ncp is less vulnerable to climate change than in other parts of the world in addition the expected increase in the yield and wue of wheat may positively affect current depletion rates of groundwater for irrigation however more work is needed to quantify this in future it will be possible to introduce short duration wheat and long duration maize second crop in rotation cultivars keywords aquacrop climate change ensemble projections general circulation models growth cycle irrigation management 1 introduction the future climate is expected to become more extreme e g high frequency of heat cold waves extended periods of drought intensive rainfall and variable schar et al 2004 having negative impacts on wheat production trnka et al 2014 since climate is one of the most important determining factors for crop production changes in temperature co2 concentration and frequency of occurrence of different extreme events drought heat may significantly affect crop yield and field operations field 2012 the magnitude and direction of climate change impacts on crop production are complex and in many details uncertain this is due to the complex nature of interaction among different climate variables viz temperature co2 rainfall walker and schulze 2008 that may result in both positive and negative outcome generally warming is known to decrease crop yields especially where temperature exceeds the optimum range asseng et al 2015a however at higher latitudes where low temperature is a limitation climate change may increase crop yields for instance in north america izaurralde et al 2003 and sweden eckersten et al 2001 increase in co2 concentration can benefit crop production by increasing net assimilation rates and increasing water use efficiency ainsworth and long 2005 vanuytrecht et al 2012 however the co2 fertilization effects on crops are still uncertain and quite variable within both c3 and c4 plants generally the co2 fertilization effects are more pronounced for c3 than c4 crops however the magnitude of these effects is also affected by other factors such as availability of soil water nitrogen temperature dier et al 2018a b pacholski et al 2015 this suggests that the climate impacts are crop and site specific and cannot be generalized for different regions crops thus reiterating the need to conduct crop and site specific impact assessments climate change is expected to perturb key crop processes e g phenological development and crop growth asseng et al 2015a the increase in air temperature is expected to increase crop water demand lobell et al 2013 conversely accelerated growth under high temperature can shorten the crop growth cycle which can reduce the seasonal water use tao and zhang 2013 besides elevated co2 is expected to lower crop transpirational losses ultimately reducing the crop water use drake et al 1997 these changes may also affect current field operations such as amount and timing of different crop inputs liu et al 2013 understanding how crop water use is affected under different climate scenarios might be helpful in agricultural planning the site specific assessment of climate change impacts on crop yield plant processes and crop water use is crucial not only to understand future challenges but also to improve and develop adaptive management practices challinor et al 2014 carried out an extensive meta analysis including more than 1700 research papers and concluded that the climate change impacts on crop production could be minimized reversed through adaptation strategies when evaluating the scenarios of climate change involving changes in temperature rainfall and co2 concentration considering management practices and possible changes is vital especially in areas where freshwater is a limited resource e g the north china plain ncp developing water management practices for increasing crop production as well as safeguarding groundwater resources is of utmost importance in water scarce regions such as the ncp zhang et al 2008 whether or not the current management practices will be effective in future is uncertain climate and management scenarios can be analyzed with process based crop simulation models future climate projections by different general circulation models gcms can serve as inputs to process based models after downscaling and bias correction vanuytrecht et al 2016 a few studies have assessed the impacts of climate change on wheat in the ncp lv et al 2013 tao and zhang 2013 however little is known about how wheat yield water use and water use efficiency will be affected under different rcp scenarios representative concentration pathways and different water management strategies in the ncp most of previous studies considered only the effects of climate change it is however important to investigate the impacts of climate change in combination with different water management practices in the ncp therefore the objective of this study was to assess the impacts of gcm ensemble climate projections on yield and water use efficiency of wheat additionally we aimed to assess the potential of water management practices deficit irrigation mulching in combination with climate change rcp scenarios the hypotheses for this study were i a combination of mulching co2 fertilization and deficit irrigation will reduce water use and increase crop water use efficiency and ii the co2 fertilization and positive or less negative effect of high temperature will increase wheat yield in the ncp this case study focused on a site in the ncp and to our knowledge is the first simulation study applying the aquacrop model for climate impact assessment in combination with different water management scenarios in the ncp 2 materials and methods 2 1 site climate impacts on yield and water use of wheat were assessed for the luancheng site situated at the base of taihang mountain altitude 50 m 37 53 n 114 40 e in the ncp the ncp is characterized by double cropping system where winter wheat and summer maize are grown in rotation winter wheat is sown in october and harvested around 10th of june the long term seasonal sowing to harvest average rainfall and potential evapotranspiration eto for wheat are 132 mm and 498 mm respectively zhang et al 2008 the long term average 1984 2015 monthly temperature and precipitation is shown in table 1 the sub zero temperature during december january and february limits wheat growth however low temperature is also needed for vernalization the ncp is an alluvial plain where soils are classified as sandy loam loam and clay loam the soil at luancheng experimental station is classified as loam which is also the dominant soil type in the ncp the soil is well drained and considered as best for arable cropping average field capacity and wilting point for 2 m soil profile are 36 and 13 v v respectively zhang et al 2008 the readily available water raw for plants in a 2 m deep soil profile is around 240 mm soil hydrological properties for different soil layers are given by zhang et al 2008 2 2 climate change scenarios and data the present study considered the rcp scenarios rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 rcp 6 0 and rcp 8 5 which are greenhouse gas concentration pathways indicating the expected radiative forcing in the year 2100 three future time slices representing the 2040s 2060s and 2080s were chosen general circulation models gcms that are used to project future climate differ in their structure thus may lead to different projections to get reliable and probabilistic climate projections it is advised to use model ensembles knutti et al 2010 we considered two options i future climate projection with an ensemble of 10 gcms that produced an average climate average climatology of 10 gcms ii additionally late century 2080s projections were made using five individual gcms under rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 the gcms were chosen randomly from the available options in the marksim weather generator and those that are also included in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 since our objective was to study the uncertainties in projected crop production due to different gcms but not to highlight the differences among different gcms we did not compare or discuses different gcms climate impact studies have also used infinite change in climate variables iizumi et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 however using the weather generator climate data is also useful because it can cover the unexpected variability in daily weather including unexpected extreme events the details of gcms used in present study are given in supplementary material table s1 climate data were generated using the marksim weather generator jones and thornton 2013 marksim takes outputs from the gcms with original resolution and interpolates these to a 30 arc second climate surface using the worldclim database hijmans et al 2005 to generate an average climate representing multiple gcms the marksim averages the polynomial functions that drive different gcms in this case the differences among different gcms are averaged the weather generator has been extensively calibrated with a large number 10 000 of weather stations throughout the world the data generated with marksim does not need additional bias correction because it uses worldclim database hijmans et al 2005 for this purpose which is probably the most comprehensive 1 km precision historic climate mapping for the world and is widely used in agricultural and geophysical sciences further details about the weather generator its downscaling and bias correction procedures are given by jones and thornton 2013 the marksim weather generator has been used throughout the world including the ncp lv et al 2013 the co2 concentrations under different rcp scenarios were taken from meinshausen et al 2011 and are shown in table s4 the baseline climate data 1984 2015 was taken from the weather station at the luancheng research station 2 3 management scenarios we tested four management options scenarios including mulch no mulch full irrigation fi and deficit irrigation di mulch and no mulch were defined as the surface practices with a capacity to reduce 60 and 0 of soil evaporation respectively mulch has been found to increase wue of wheat by up to 60 qin et al 2015a in aquacrop it s possible to simulate the effects of soil surface practices on soil evaporation i e mulch we defined the soil surface practices such that it would reduce the evaporation by 60 this depends on percentage of soil surface covered by mulch during the growing period and effect of mulch in reducing soil evaporation these two were defined as 80 and 75 respectively with cumulative effect of 60 reduction in soil evaporation for mulch scenario the no mulch scenario was defined where soil surface practices e g mulch had no effect on soil evaporation full and deficit irrigation scenarios were defined as practices where irrigation was applied automatically by the model after depleting 100 and 150 of readily available water raw respectively for both full and deficit irrigation scenarios soil water content was restored to field capacity after depleting the 100 and 150 of raw respectively the irrigation scenarios were defined by considering the fact that in aquacrop model used in this study plants do not suffer any drought stress unless 100 of raw is depleted depleting 100 175 and 175 of raw leads to stomatal closure and senescence related stresses respectively hence the irrigation strategies chosen in the present study represent true full and deficit irrigation practices defining irrigation scenarios on the basis of depletion of raw in the aquacrop is a unique concept because it allows imposing the required level of drought stress accurately the concept is useful to test new adaptation and or irrigation strategies as one of our objectives was to test full causing no drought stress and deficit moderate drought stress causing stomatal closure without senescence irrigation strategies we defined our scenarios on the basis of depletion of raw the soil profile 2 m in the ncp is replenished by summer rainfall thus both for full and deficit irrigation soil was considered to be at field capacity fc at the start of simulations the simulations for each season were carried out separately initializing at fc the assumption of considering the soil at fc at the start of simulations is realistic because more than 70 of total annual rainfall occurs during the summer months leaving soils fully replenished after the harvest of maize if the rainfall is insufficient a soaking irrigation is applied and soil is brought to fc before the start of seedbed preparation for winter wheat soaking irrigation is applied to avoid lower germination rate and delayed emergence we also found that no substantial change is expected in rainfall amount and pattern under future climate scenarios for our study site fig 2 hence both for baseline period and future climate scenarios simulations for each season were initialized at fc 2 4 model climate and management effects were assessed using the aquacrop model aquacrop is a multi crop 10 water driven crop simulation model li et al 2016 steduto et al 2009 vanuytrecht et al 2014 zhuo et al 2016 that has been widely used for many crops including winter wheat in china huang et al 2017 iqbal et al 2014 jin et al 2017 2018 qin et al 2015b xing et al 2017 since aquacrop is a water driven model it has been used in numerous studies to evaluate and design irrigation practices and to help agricultural water management zhang et al 2013 zhuo et al 2016 aquacrop also allows simulating under climate change and has been used to simulate the effects of elevated temperature and co2 fertilization muluneh et al 2015 shrestha and shrestha 2016 vanuytrecht et al 2011 aquacrop model has been tested with multi crop and multi site free air co2 enrichment face experimental datasets and has proved excellent in simulating the effects of elevated co2 on biomass and grain yield r2 0 90 vanuytrecht et al 2011 aquacrop also considers the effects of temperature stress cold and heat on biomass production that is specified by a stress coefficient ks for example for low temperature stress the ks vary between 0 and 1 with 1 indicating no stress on biomass production the shape of the curve between 0 and 1 is logistic the upper and lower thresholds of ks curve are defined in terms of growing degree days gdds per day daily mean temperatures were used to calculate the gdds while the base tbase and upper tupp temperatures for calculating the gdds were 0 ºc and 26 ºc respectively in the present study the upper and lower thresholds for cold stress were fixed at 10 and 0 gdds day 1 respectively where 10 being the minimum gdds required for full biomass production aquacrop is relatively simple but very robust in simulating different plant processes steduto et al 2009 detailed model structure and equations are given by raes et al 2009 aquacrop has previously been calibrated and tested under different irrigation treatments in the ncp iqbal et al 2014 however we re calibrated and validated the model using field data from the luancheng agro ecosystem experimental station aquacrop uses six input files i e climate crop soil management irrigation and initial conditions there are both conservative and less conservative parameters the conservative parameters can be fixed as default however the non conservative parameters need to be updated depending on crop cultivar site or management in this study the less conservative parameters that are cultivar and management specific were carefully adjusted the parameter values used in this process were taken from multiple sources including field measurements local experience and literature supplementary material table s2 the parameters that cannot be easily measured were calibrated with trial and error method supplementary material table s2 the field observations on grain yield final biomass and soil water content were available from the luancheng experimental station the data used for calibration and validation of the model is from a long term irrigation experiment the experiment included different irrigation treatments where efforts were made to avoid any other stresses e g crop was well fertilized and pest weeds insects and diseases attacks were minimized using manual and chemical approaches more details about the experiment crop husbandry and data are given by zhang et al 2017 the data used included two separate sets of 10 independent experimental units viz 5 irrigation treatments 2 years the irrigation treatments varied in frequency and amount of watering starting from rainfed with no supplementary irrigation to well watered with 5 supplementary irrigations zhang et al 2017 since the model was going to be used for full deficit irrigation scenarios the calibration validation datasets also included different treatments that varied in irrigation amounts ranging from deficit to well watered the data from 2007 08 and 2009 10 seasons was used for calibration while 2010 11 and 2011 12 seasons were used for validation of the model no other stress e g nutrient salinity and pests was considered while calibrating validating the model the model was calibrated manually where simulations were compared with observations followed by updating the model parameters to improve model performance model performance was evaluated with a number of statistics viz normalized root mean square error nrmse eq 1 mean absolute error mae eq 2 and percent deviation pd eq 3 where si and mi are simulated and measured values and m is mean of measured values the nrmse values lower than 20 indicates a good model performance jamieson et al 1991 while the mae and pd values close to zero indicate better performance 1 n r m s e s i m i 2 n x 100 m 2 m a e 1 n s i m i 3 p e r c e n t d e v i a t i o n s i m u l a t e d m e a s u r e d 100 m e a s u r

aquacrop the climate and management scenarios were analysed for 48 scenario combinations including four rcps two irrigation strategies two mulching levels and three time slices the simulations for the baseline period were run for the period 1984 to 2015 considering full irrigation with no mulch in order to separate the temperature and co2 fertilization effects additional simulations were performed with future climate and baseline 1984 2015 average co2 concentration 370 ppm the variability in future projections due to different gcms was assessed for the late century time slice 2080s using the climate data from five individual gcms under rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 the impacts of climate change and co2 fertilization are presented as average change from the baseline period the difference between the future and baseline periods was calculated for grain yield water use efficiency and crop evapotranspiration and results are shown as average percent deviation 3 results 3 1 model evaluation the model validation results showed very good agreement between the measured and simulated grain yield of wheat fig 1 the statistical indices in fig 1 confirms the good model performance for independent datasets including five irrigation treatments and two seasons 2010 11 2011 12 the simulated yield of winter wheat averaged over the baseline period 1984 2015 was 7 7 0 5 t ha 1 which corresponded well with the measured average yield 6 0 1 1 t ha 1 agricultural yearbook of luancheng county and 6 5 1 0 t ha 1 luancheng experimental station the model slightly overestimated the observed yields however it should be noticed that yield measured at the experimental station and especially from the farmer s field is affected by additional yield reducing factors e g diseases and pests that are generally not accounted for in the model model performance for simulating the time taken to flowering was also very good viz nmrse 1 16 days mae 1 50 days and percent deviation 0 23 3 2 climate projections ensemble projections average climatology of 10 gcms agree on future temperature rise under all rcp scenarios fig 2 the expected increase in temperature will be higher towards the end of the 21st century except for rcp 2 6 which will result in slight increase followed by a slight decrease the projected increase will be higher in minimum than maximum temperature ensemble projections indicated no substantial difference in seasonal october to may rainfall comparing the future and baseline periods for winter wheat in the ncp fig 2 3 3 climate impacts 3 3 1 grain yield and related processes climate impacts including co2 fertilization effects and changes in rainfall on wheat yield are given in fig 3 the wheat yield is expected to increase with impacts varying with rcp scenarios and timeline compared with the baseline period 1984 2015 the wheat yield during the 2040s 2060s and 2080s is projected to increase with the range varying from 24 to 56 fig 3 full irrigation with no mulch the yield is expected to increase even when co2 fertilization effects are ignored fig 4 the contribution of co2 fertilization was highest under high concentration scenarios rcp 6 0 rcp 8 5 for the late century time slice 2080s comparing the results presented in figs 3 and 4 indicate that the contribution of co2 fertilization in increasing wheat yield could vary between 10 and 32 depending on the rcp scenarios and timeline the wheat growth period is expected to shorten between 8 19 days and 18 43 days when compared with the baseline period fig 5 the low temperature stress affecting the biomass production will also decrease considerably under climate change fig 6 3 3 2 water use and water use efficiency the seasonal planting to maturity evapotranspiration of wheat is expected to decrease compared to the baseline period the seasonal transpiration with co2 fertilization is expected to decrease between 10 and 27 depending on the rcp scenarios and timeline fig 7 full irrigation without mulch the reduction in transpiration is likely even without co2 fertilization beccause of shortening of growing season however the extent will be lower supplementary material fig s1 the evaporation was projected to either remain unaffected or vary marginally from the baseline 6 except rcp 8 5 2080s fig 8 full irrigation without mulch the reduction in evapotranspiration together with the positive effect on yield will increase water use efficiency wue of wheat under all rcp scenarios fig 9 full irrigation without mulch the increase in wue with without co2 fertilization will vary between 36 21 and 109 52 under different rcp scenarios and future times slices figs 9 10 3 4 climate change effects under deficit irrigation and mulching analysis of the management scenarios involving deficit irrigation and mulching indicated that these practices could be useful in sustaining yield and increasing wue of wheat under climate change applying mulch with full irrigation did not significantly affect simulated grain yield 6 vs no mulch fig 3 however the contribution of mulch in increasing wue under full irrigation varied between 15 and 40 fig 9 primarily due to lower evaporation fig 8 furthermore the increase in grain yield under deficit irrigation no mulch was nearly the same 7 with di as under full irrigation fig 3 however the wue did increase 3 15 fig 9 the contribution of mulch in increasing wue under deficit irrigation varied between 13 and 29 fig 9 the amount of irrigation applied under different rcp scenarios time slices and management scenarios is presented in supplementary material supplementary material table s3 the irrigation demand was considerably lower under di with mulch for all rcp scenarios the average irrigation demand under full irrigation treatment was also lower supplementary material table s3 than the average amount of irrigation applied under baseline simulations with full irrigation 242 mm 3 5 variability in projected crop production due to gcms the projected variation in crop production due to different gcms was higher for the high end scenario rcp 8 5 2080s compared to low concentration scenario rcp 2 6 fig 11 the projected increase in grain yield under rcp 8 5 varied between 31 and 51 due to different gcms however this variation was lower yield increase range 21 29 under rcp 2 6 fig 11a likewise the variation in the projected wue fig 11b and growth cycle fig 11c due to different gcms was lower under rcp 2 6 than under rcp 8 5 these results highlight the differences among different gcms to project future climate that ultimately affects the impact assessments 4 discussion climate change is generally characterized by changes in temperature rainfall patterns and co2 concentration its impact on crop production and especially the interaction among the abovementioned variables is complex walker and schulze 2008 with possibility of both beneficial and harmful effects asseng et al 2013 studies considering the temperature increase have indicated that the wheat production can be negatively affected under climate change asseng et al 2011 if temperature exceeds the optimum range ortiz et al 2008 however the increase in co2 concentration is known to have positive effects on all c3 crops including wheat ainsworth and long 2005 we found that the wheat yield at our study site luancheng ncp is projected to increase in future under all rcp scenarios fig 3 previous studies have shown that yield of some crops or crops in specific regions might be positively affected by climate change for instance grain yield of wheat has been reported to increase under climate change mainly in the areas where low temperature is a limitation such as in sweden eckersten et al 2001 northern china tao and zhang 2013 and northern america izaurralde et al 2003 recent studies involving multi method assessments by liu et al 2016 and zhao et al 2017 revealed that the effects of increased temperature on wheat yield in china are less severe than in other regions a number of other climate impact studies have also demonstrated the positive effect of climate change on wheat in the ncp guo et al 2010 lv et al 2013 tao and zhang 2013 the wheat yield at our study site would benefit from both the increase in temperature and co2 fertilization the positive effects of co2 fertilization on crop growth and yield are generally known especially for c3 crops ainsworth and long 2005 amthor 2001 kimball et al 2002 we showed that the co2 fertilization contributed to yield increase by between 10 and 32 depending on different rcp scenarios and timeline figs 3 4 in agreement with our findings a previous modelling study showed that the co2 fertilization could contribute up to 40 to yield increase in different parts of ncp tao and zhang 2013 a three year free air carbon dioxide enrichment face field study showed that elevated co2 can increase wheat yield up to 10 however the grain quality was negatively affected when compared with the ambient co2 concentration högy and fangmeier 2008 högy et al 2009 other experimental studies by fangmeier et al 1996 and schütz and fangmeier 2001 also indicated that elevated co2 can increase wheat grain yield by 34 and 45 respectively likewise dubey et al 2015 analysed the results from 82 experiments and concluded that elevated co2 is expected to increase yield of wheat through positive effects on growth development and net assimilation rate however the positive effects of elevated co2 are likely less prominent if combined with other adverse factors under climate change e g drought heat nutrient deficiency dier et al 2018a b dubey et al 2015 manderscheid et al 2014 the sensitivity of plants to other abiotic stresses i e drought is also expected to change at elevated co2 concentration gray et al 2016 yan et al 2017 thereby adding additional uncertainities the long term adaptation of plants to elevated co2 and how that will affect crop production is also uncertain ainsworth and long 2005 inspite of this the results from present study and previous experiental and modelling studies indicate that wheat in general will benefit from elevated co2 under climate change in addition to the positive effeects of co2 fertilization the wheat yield at our study site also benefited from the temperature increase among the processes affecting yield under climate change the shortening of the growing cycle especially the grain filling period is crucial and has been reported to be the main reason affecting grain yield asseng et al 2015a however despite considerable shorter total growth cycle fig 5 we showed that wheat yield would increase with climate change in the ncp this is because the grain filling duration is expected to remain unaffected supplementary material fig s2 the reduction in the growing cycle was largely due to shortening of overwintering period tao and zhang 2013 also carried out modelling assessment and found that the shortening of the growing cycle of wheat under climate change is due to shorter vegetative phase while the reproductive phase remains unaffected in the ncp relatively shorter vegetative compared to reproductive phase has also been reported from long term warming experiments at the luancheng station ncp liu et al 2013 moreover due to accelerated growth the flowering and maturity can be reached earlier than for the baseline period that may also help to avoid high temperatures in summer supplementary material fig s2 our analysis showed that the increase in temperature will ease the low temperature stress on biomass production of wheat that in return may have an overall positive effect on grain yield conversely tan et al 2018 studied the combined effects of elevated daily mean temperature 2 5 2 8 c and co2 concentration 600 ppm in an open top chamber experiment and reported that the grain yield of wheat decreases in the ncp interestingly they associated the effects to low temperature arguing that elevated temperature accelerated plant growth and exposed the critical developmental stages flowering to a cooler temperature nonetheless our study results in agreement with others studies indicate that winter wheat in the ncp will benefit from both co2 fertilization and warming apart from the effects on crop growth developmental and yield warming is expected to increase the water use evapotranspiration et liu et al 2013 lobell et al 2013 on the contrary the expected reduction in growing cycle and co2 fertilization can decrease seasonal water use lv et al 2013 in addition accelerated growth and early harvest of wheat may also avoid the hot dry periods in late may and early june ultimately reducing the overall crop water demand we showed that the changes in evaporation over the wheat growing season were only marginal when compared with the baseline period fig 8 a substantial reduction in seasonal transpiration fig 7 together with a considerable increase in grain yield increased wue under all rcp scenarios and time slices fig 9 using the modelling approach guo et al 2010 studied the effects of climate change on wheat yield and water use in the ncp and reported that the et of wheat might decrease under a2a and a1b emission scenarios they also reported substantial 40 increase in wue of wheat under climate change in another modelling study lv et al 2013 reported a slight increase 4 8 in et between 2030s and 2070s under different emission scenarios a2 a1 and b1 however the increase in yield was higher 17 26 which increased wue likewise tao and zhang 2013 carried out super ensemble based projections for the whole ncp and reported that the seasonal et might increase by 5 8 a substantial increase in yield will increase wue of wheat climate change induced increase in wue of wheat has been shown in present and other modelling studies guo et al 2010 tao and zhang 2013 analysis of long term experimental data 1983 2010 has also shown that changes in temperature and precipitation significantly increased wue of wheat from 1983 to 2010 zhang et al 2015 despite all the reported positive effects of climate change on wue there also exists sizeable uncertainty in both crop yield and water use under climate change scenarios guo et al 2010 xiao et al 2018 moreover experimental studies have shown that wheat yield and wue can also decrease due to warming driven increase in evaporative water losses and reduced water availability hence it s vital that while reporting the positive effects of climate change on wue the associated uncertainties should also be discussed the irrigation demand based on water use for wheat is expected to decrease under all rcp scenarios the amount of water applied to restore the soil water content to field capacity under different management and climate rcp scenarios indicate a reduction in irrigation demand supplementary material table s3 the demand will further decrease from rcp 2 6 to rcp 8 5 but mainly under di with and without mulch the role of climate change in affecting the irrigation demand will be due to both temperature and co2 the seasonal transpiration is expected to decrease fig 7 because high co2 concentration under different rcp scenarios meinshausen et al 2011 will decrease stomatal opening and thereby leaf conductance drake et al 1997 besides due to accelerated growth the growth cycle will shorten and the crop would avoid the late may and early june supplementary fig s2 which can reduce water use because the atmospheric demand during this period is generally very high the interaction between management and climate scenarios can further sustain crop production and water resources in the ncp because the di and mulching would reduce irrigation demand due to lower transpiration water stress induced stomatal closure fig 7 and evaporation mulch effect fig 8 it should be noticed that the irrigation amounts presented in supplementary table s3 are the average multiple seasons amounts applied to restore the soil water content to field capacity after depleting 100 full irrigation and 150 deficit irrigation of readily available water the irrigation demand under different management and rcp scenarios could also be assessed comparing the total amount of water used in evapotranspiration during the whole season figs 7 and 8 the expected reduction in crop water use evapotranspiration could be helpful to restore and or reduce the groundwater depletion rates in the ncp the present study indicates that adopting di with mulch may significantly reduce irrigation demand and thus could be helpful to reduce groundwater extraction in future we only considered one site luancheng in this study however more work is needed to assess the potential for the whole region apart from management other adaptation measures should also be considered recently research focus has shifted towards changing the cropping system intensity where alternative crop rotation options have been investigated modelling studies have indicated that reducing the cropping intensity 3 crops in two years can help bringing sustainability in water use xiao et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 nevertheless more experimental work is needed to explore the viable adaptation measures climate change impacts on crop production have been studied through a range of methodologies including experimental modelling and analytical approaches the process based crop simulation models are used for long term climate impact assessments and can also provide useful information regarding the upcoming challenge and possible adaption measures vanuytrecht et al 2016 the main issue with modelling studies is uncertainty in impact assessments that may arise due to the limited knowledge of complex biophysical processes model s ability to reproduce the biophysical processes accuracy of input data and limited information on local practices zampieri et al 2018 the climate models that are used to project future climate also differ in their structure which may result in different projections even when starting with same driving scenarios knutti et al 2010 the use of crop asseng et al 2015b and climate knutti et al 2010 model ensembles has been suggested as an option to get probabilistic projections however despite having limitations to reproduce all biophysical responses robust crop models can still be used to assess the relations between yield and climate anomalies lobell et al 2013 and to project the impacts of climate change on crop production muluneh et al 2015 vanuytrecht et al 2016 the approach used in present study is standard where gcms were used to project future climate while the climate change effects were assessed with a simple but robust crop simulation model aquacrop although we did not use an ensemble of crop models the simulated impacts on wheat production in the ncp were fairly comparable with other studies using complex crop simulation models guo et al 2010 mo et al 2009 multi model super ensembles tao and zhang 2013 and multi method approaches liu et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 an advantage of using aquacrop is that it is simple but robust requiring less input data than many other models raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 vanuytrecht et al 2014 in addition it provides an option to assess the climate change effects under different management practices which can also be used to design adaption measures 5 conclusions analysis with the aquacrop model involving the effects of temperature co2 and rainfall changes showed that the wheat yield is expected to increase in the ncp under all rcp scenarios wheat in the ncp is expected to benefit from both the increase in temperature and co2 fertilization the total growing cycle of wheat is expected to decrease under climate change however the actual grain filling duration will not be affected moreover the elevated temperature is expected to ease the low temperature stress on biomass production during the winter the seasonal et is expected to decrease mainly due to a high co2 induced reduction in transpiration and shortened growing cycle reduced et together with an increase in yield are expected to increase wue of wheat the variability in the projections due to different general circulation models is higher for high end scenario rcp 8 5 2080s assessment of mulching and deficit irrigation under different rcp scenarios showed that these practices could sustain grain yield and increase wue of wheat in the ncp acknowledgements financial

10959,permanent crops like almond prunus dulcis require significant water inputs for economic yields and long term productivity this demand creates a challenge in drought prone regions like california use of organic matter amendments oma can improve water use efficiency by conserving soil moisture and reducing tree water stress the majority of almond orchards in california are no till with irrigation targeted on a narrow tree berm where oma is applied as surface mulch we examined the effects of composted dairy manure cm and the timing of its application on soil moisture soil water retention and tree water status in a young orchard planted in 2014 treatments including fall applied cm october 2015 and 2016 spring applied cm april 2016 and 2017 and an unamended control were monitored during the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons fall applied cm was more readily incorporated in soil organic matter of the 0 60 cm rooting zone as evidenced by significantly greater soil organic carbon soc for fall versus spring applied cm in 2016 p 0 05 fall applied cm significantly increased soil volumetric water content vwc by 22 from 0 to 150 cm depth during the driest period of year one and tended to make midday stem water potential swp less negative relative to the control fall applied cm tended to increase vwc in 2017 but treatment differences were no longer significant differences in vwc and swp between fall applied cm and the control were most apparent at low vwc 10 two years of fall applied cm increased soil water retention between 0 to 100 kpa at 0 10 cm depth by 13 compared to the control these results demonstrate fall applied cm was more effective at enhancing soil moisture retention and reducing tree water stress compared to spring applied cm we also conclude oma use may buffer against periods of limited water supply for young trees keywords composted manure application timing neutron probe stem water potential almond 1 introduction sustainable water use in permanent crops is a priority in regions of high water demand like california california s central valley hosts the world s largest region of permanent crops where orchards and vineyards comprise 13 of agricultural acreage and produces 80 of almonds worldwide cdfa 2017 usda 2016 irrigated tree crops account for 34 of agricultural water use in california after dairy farming nut crops are the highest net water users defined as water applied minus runoff and leaching johnson and cody 2015 climate change increases the likelihood of more frequent and high intensity droughts swain et al 2018 and given the high dependency of permanent crops on water resources it is critical to increase water conservation and water use efficiency particularly for intensively grown crops such as almond management practices to improve soil water storage and increase water availability during critical growth periods may lead to irrigation water savings and increase orchard resilience during drought events use of organic matter amendments oma such as composted manure cm in orchards is a promising strategy to enhance water use efficiency lordan et al 2015 reganold et al 2001 california is the number one dairy producing state with over 1300 registered dairies cdfa 2017 manure produced by dairies is an abundant oma source available to growers in california s central valley in a survey of oma practices 40 of oma users identified soil water holding capacity as a primary or secondary benefit of oma use khalsa and brown 2017 in california almond orchards are predominantly no till and equipped with microirrigation where water is applied on a narrow tree berm allowing for targeted wetting of soil with tree roots smart et al 2011 tindula et al 2013 as a result oma application is often as a surface mulch placed in the same wetted area in order to facilitate decomposition the effect of oma on soil moisture and tree water status in no till partially wetted orchards is uncertain and even

the few permanent crop studies conducted in apple malus spp in a temperate climate reported no effect of oma on soil awc deurer et al 2008 more research is needed on the complex effects of oma and its management including timing application on soil water availability this need is particularly urgent in permanent crops where stress from limited soil moisture can impact orchard productivity for years beyond stress events de la rosa et al 2016 shackel et al 1998 tree water status measured by midday stem water potential swp is one of several factors that determines growth productivity and water use of orchards reduced photosynthesis canopy development and fruit growth are tree physiological responses to water stress lampinen et al 2001 shackel et al 2000 there is strong evidence that water stress in the early stages of tree growth is detrimental to orchard productivity girona et al 1997 goldhamer et al 1999 shackel et al 1998 few studies have monitored swp response in trees treated with oma lordan et al 2015 it is reasonable to ascertain that management practices such as oma use that increase soil moisture retention will also reduce tree water stress and ultimately improve tree growth and long term orchard productivity this study examines the impact of oma and application timing on soil and tree water status under conditions where oma is applied as mulch and wetted by irrigation during the growing season the aim of this research was to quantify the impact of fall applied and spring applied composted dairy manure cm on volumetric water content vwc soil water retention and tree water status compared to an unamended control we hypothesize som accumulation during oma decomposition will enhance vwc and soil water retention with subsequent impacts on tree water status we also predict higher vwc and tree swp with fall applied cm compared to spring applied cm due to greater c incorporation into som during the winter months prior to the growing season 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the experimental site was a 3rd and 4th leaf almond prunus dulcis orchard during 2016 and 2017 in san joaquin county california 37 49 33 n 121 6 46 w on manteca fine sandy loam mixed thermic typic durixeroll the region has a mediterranean climate with an average annual temperature of 17 c and average annual rainfall 450 mm with most precipitation occurring between october and april the orchard was planted in 2014 at a density of 272 tree ha 1 with 5 5 m tree and 6 7 m row spacings of the cultivar nonpareil and alternating rows of the cultivars aldridge and carmel all trees were grafted on hanson rootstock a native duripan soil layer observed at 120 150 cm depth was ripped prior to planting the trees were irrigated using one microsprinkler per tree each with a 3 m radius and a flow rate of 47 l hr 1 the grower managed the orchard using standard irrigation nutrient pest and weed control practices for california almond orchards duncan et al 2016 the trees were first harvested in 2017 during the second year of our trial the grower managed orchard received 47 more water inputs in the 2017 growing season from april to october than in 2016 growing season fig 1 low vwc in september 2017 was a result of deficit irrigation to dry down the orchard floor prior to harvest operations historical climate data were acquired from the cimis california irrigation management information system station located 9 8 km from our field study site in manteca ca cimis 2018 cumulative monthly reference evapotranspiration eto from may 1st to october 1st was similar in 2016 and 2017 fig 1 with the highest eto measured in june and july in both years the experimental design was a randomized complete split block design with four blocks and two main plot treatments main plots received oma treatments applied with cm or an unamended control and subplots were timing of oma as either fall applied in october 2015 and 2016 prior to the subsequent growing season or spring applied in april 2016 and 2017 during the growing season for a total of 12 plots map 1 duplicate samples were taken at two locations per plot which were randomly selected from a row length of 660 m cm with a c to n ratio c n of 11 1 was applied annually at the equivalent rate of 9 mg ha 1 at 30 moisture as a surface mulch on the tree berm the control was managed using synthetic fertilizer injected in split applications through the microsprinkler irrigation system all plots received the same rate of water and fertilizer 2 2 field measurements aluminum neutron probe access tubes were installed to 1 5 m depth to monitor soil moisture during the growing season from april to october soil moisture was measured using a cpn 503tdr hydroprobe instrotek inc concord ca hydroprobe counts measured soil moisture of a 20 30 cm radius sphere and measurements were taken at 30 cm increments from 30 to 150 cm depth measurements were collected at 2 week intervals between 1 to 3 days before irrigation events to represent drier periods in the growing season and to minimize the variation due to irrigation missing data from october 2017 were the result of conflicting field operations during installation of access tubes soil samples were collected using a madera sampler to determine bulk density and vwc for hydroprobe calibration the hydroprobe count ratio was fitted to a linear calibration equation r2 0 83 to convert the count ratio to vwc dickey et al 1993 irrigation emitter flow rate was measured in all plots and equaled 41 5 l hr 1 0 41 in 2016 and 36 4 l hr 1 1 16 in 2017 distribution uniformity du was calculated using the ratio of average flow rate of lowest ¼ of the orchard and average flow rate of the whole orchard and equaled 92 7 in 2016 and 80 6 in 2017 tree midday stem water potential swp was measured on trees within the same plots where access tubes were installed using a model 3000 pressure chamber soil moisture equipment corp goleta ca readings were taken midday between 1 00 to 3 00 pm on the same day as soil moisture measurements a leaf from a shaded position near the trunk was selected and bagged for a minimum of 10 min prior to recording the swp measurement swp was measured from may to september when mature healthy leaves were available baseline swp swp for a fully irrigated almond tree was determined using the relative humidity and temperature measured at the field site on each day swp measurements were performed and calculated following mccutchan and shackel 1992 swp values are reported as the difference from the baseline a modified litter bag technique referred to here as litter rings was utilized to estimate decomposition of cm on tree berms as total mass loss of cm during the study period pre weighed amendments were contained in a pvc pipe 30 cm diameter by 2 54 cm high with coarse mesh netting 0 08 cm openings attached to the pvc pipe bottom and pinned on top of the soil in august 2016 and 2017 litter rings were collected and weighed to estimate cm decomposition during october 2016 and 2017 soil beneath litter rings from 0 to 60 cm depth were sampled ground de carbonated and analyzed for total soil organic carbon soc harris et al 2001 brown and sanden unpublished data estimated the active rooting zone for almond trees under microirrigation to be between 20 60 cm depth and vrugt et al 2001 determined almond tree water uptake under microirrigation occurred from 0 to 40 cm depth uniformity of soil texture was confirmed between experimental plots to 1 5 m depth by the rapid sieving technique kettler et al 2001 2 3 water retention curves water retention curves were constructed using the simplified evaporation method peters and durner 2008 undisturbed soil samples were collected from fall applied cm and control plots in january 2018 from the 0 10 cm soil layer using 250 ml stainless steel rings at 30 cm from neutron probe access tubes samples were covered with plastic caps stored at 4 c and processed within approximately 10 weeks of collection samples were saturated in a pan of water via capillary action after which two precision tensiometers housed in a cylindrical pressure sensing unit hyprop ums gmbh munich germany were inserted into each samples with sensor units were placed on a digital balance and left to dry gradually via evaporation at room temperature 28 c while water potential pressure head and sample mass were continuously recorded in the hyprop fit software v 3 5 1 13951 pertassek et al 2015 water retention curves were fit using the modified van genuchten model for soil hydraulic properties van genuchten 1980 given in eq 1 below 1 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m where θ is volumetric water content mm3 mm 3 θr is residual volumetric water content θs is saturated volumetric water content h is soil water potential kpa α is a scaling parameter inversely proportional to the mean pore diameter cm 1 and n and m are shaping parameters 2 4 statistical analyses soil moisture and midday swp analyses were conducted using a mixed effects model structured for repeated measures on log transformed data and soc and oma decomposition analyses were conducted by anova and a tukey test using sas 9 4 sas institute cary nc vwc measurements below 150 cm depth were erratic perhaps due to remnants of a duripan layer and therefore eliminated from statistical analyses we averaged vwc across depth in the root zone as the depth by treatment interaction was not significant p 0 05 optimal shaping and scaling parameters for van genuchten soil water retention curves were determined using port routines in the stats package of r gay 1990 to minimize root mean square error a lag element was included in the statistical model to account for residual autocorrelation and non independence across time the response variable was normalized by overall mean to account for different initial saturated water contents among samples a linear model with the optimized van genuchten model and the lag element as explanatory variables was run for pooled both treatments combined as fixed effect and grouped treatment as fixed effect data comparative model fit between the two structures was evaluated using the akaike information criterion aic and mallow s cp metrics to test whether the van genuchten model parameters were significantly different between treatments i e whether the model grouped by treatment was any more informative than the pooled model 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil moisture 3 1 1 seasonal soil moisture patterns soil moisture from 0 to 150 cm depth averaged across treatments and years decreased by 47 over the duration of the growing season fig 2 in 2016 the vwc dropped 38 from april to june and we observed relatively dry soil conditions with an average of 0 09 cm3 cm 3 from july to october in 2017 vwc decreased uniformly from april to september these results are expected because almond trees deplete soil water reserves by mid to late summer and high et during june to august drives water loss from soil and leaf surfaces shackel et al 1997 the overall average vwc was 20 less in 2016 than the average vwc in 2017 and the average monthly vwc ranged from 12 to 20 lower in 2016 compared to 2017 except in september when soil was similarly dry these differences can be attributed to differing water management in a non harvest 2016 and harvest 2017 year 3 1 2 effects of composted manure soil moisture from 0 to 150 cm depth was 8 2 22 higher with cm relative to the control when averaged by month and treatment fig 2 fall applied cm showed the highest mean vwc in all months except april 2016 and was significantly greater than the control from july to october 2016 we measured the largest significant difference between treatments in july 2016 with 24 higher vwc in fall applied cm compared to the control the fall and spring timing treatments were not significantly different at p 0 05 soil moisture in 2017 exhibited similar trends as 2016 but treatment differences were smaller and no longer significant fig 2 soil soc was significantly higher in the fall applied cm compared to spring in 2016 but we observed no differences in 2017 table 1 the lack of a significant difference in 2017 for vwc may be related to increased irrigation or it could be due to lower du of irrigated water in 2017 compared to 2016 which was 80 6 and 92 7 respectively greater soc for fall applied cm likely played a role in the observed significant differences in vwc between fall applied cm and the control fig 2 table 1 an increase in som as well as improved soil structure mays et al 2015 oliveira and merwin 2001 following oma has also been observed in a variety of cropping systems including permanent crops hannam et al 2016 lopez et al 2014 peck et al 2011 higher som from oma in orchards also correlated with higher soil water infiltration and hydraulic conductivity goh et al 2001 lordan et al 2015 merwin et al 1994 studies with permanent crops support the observed increase in vwc in fall applied cm being the result of som accumulation improving soil structure leading to greater water infiltration and soil water retention the findings of this study are well aligned with the majority of permanent crop studies demonstrating enhanced soil moisture from oma use yet the magnitude of the effect may depend on the oma source there is strong evidence that oma with a c n ratio greater than 30 1 significantly increase soil water infiltration and reduce surface evaporation in orchards goh et al 2001 lordan et al 2015 zribi et al 2015 the c n ratio of cm from this trial 11 1 was lower than other organic mulches such as straw 75 1 and bark 200 1 bernal et al 2017 gale et al 2006 apples orchards treated with bark had higher vwc than untreated orchards granatstein and mullinix 2008 while straw mulch increased walsh et al 1996 or had no effect on vwc oliveira and merwin 2001 there is less evidence for increased soil moisture with oma sources with c n less than 30 1 hannam et al 2016 studies in apple walsh et al 1996 and california winegrape bound 2014 report significantly higher soil water content with straw and bark mulch compared to a control but no difference with cm oma with c n greater than 30 1 is more resistant to microbial decomposition and provides physical protection to the soil surface thereby reducing surface evaporation and improving water infiltration the effects of oma sources with c n less than 30 1 are likely related to som accumulation rather than physical protection of the soil surface and tend to be observed in low som soils du et al 2015 mays et al 2015 like many orchard soils in california our results demonstrate that the effect of oma timing on soil moisture alters soil and tree response as evidenced by fall applied cm increasing soil moisture more significantly than spring applied cm table 1 overwintering and greater decomposition of fall applied cm compared to spring applied cm in 2016 and significantly greater decomposition of fall applied cm in 2017 table 2 likely resulted in greater c stabilization in som multiple studies showed cool temperatures reduce the rate of c mineralization of oma ding et al 2007 nicolardot et al 1994 qi et al 2016 whereas warm soil temperatures and adequate moisture accelerated microbial mineralization of soc blanke 1997 lomander et al 1998 as oma undergoes decomposition a fraction of labile c is transformed into more complex less degradable c forms curtin et al 1998 grandy and neff 2008 prescott 2010 decomposition under cooler temperatures may enhance c stabilization derived from cm and increase resistance to mineralization during subsequent growing seasons fall applied cm increased som compared to spring applied cm and hence may be more effective in enhancing infiltration and soil moisture retention significant differences p 0 05 in vwc between fall applied cm and the control were observed in 2016 when orchard soils were drier and in months with maximum soil water depletion fig 2 similarly fall applied cm had greater som compared to spring applied cm in a dry year 2016 but not in a wetter year 2017 due to more intensive irrigation together these findings suggest that cm has a greater effect on vwc in drier years and that this effect is due to lower soil c mineralization in drier years current literature suggests oma has a stronger effect on soil moisture in dry climates and during periods of high tree water uptake granatstein and mullinix 2008 merwin et al 1994 walsh et al 1996 in orchards in an arid and semi arid climate higher soil moisture du et al 2015 and awc li et al 2017 was observed in plots with oma potential water retention with oma in dry soils has clear implications for orchard resilience to drought and suggests the greater benefit from oma use may be during years when irrigation supply is limited 3 2 soil water retention the fall applied cm treatment maintained an average of 13 more vwc between 50 150 kpa in the plant available range than the control fig 3 the best linear model for water retention showed a significant increase in vwc with fall applied cm across all measured matric potentials i e from saturation to slightly beyond field capacity t 3 84 p 0 001 model fit showed improvement with the inclusion of a grouped treatment effect and a lag element to account for auto correlation of sequential measurements indicating that coefficients for the van genuchten function differed for curves between fall applied cm and the control thus although our equipment could not measure water content at the permanent wilting point we suspect the curves would differ enough between field capacity and permanent wilting point to create differences in awc between fall applied cm and the control fall applied cm had a significant effect on soil water retention in the topsoil 0 10 cm depth and retained higher vwc than the control at matric potentials between 0 and 100 kpa fig 3 numerous studies found oma significantly increased soil water retention at saturation and field capacity carter 2007 logsdon and malone 2015 weber et al 2007 water potentials at which som most strongly influences soil moisture hudson 1994 minasny and mcbratney 2018a rawls et al 2003 a clay loam soil amended with cm had higher soil water retention at field capacity which also correlated with lower bulk density and higher porosity compared to an unamended control miller et al 2015 at field capacity soil water is retained in structural macropores 30 microns and improvement in water retention with fall applied cm at field capacity can likely be attributed to macroaggregate formation and stabilization associated with the 10 increase in soc relative to the control in 2017 eden et al 2017 rabot et al 2018 climate soil texture and management factors strongly influence som dynamics and oma effects on soil water retention vary across environmental and agronomic conditions use of oma tends to have the greatest effect on soil water retention of course textured sandy soils with a low initial som content foley and cooperband 2002 gulser and candemir 2015 weber et al 2007 similar to the soil type in this study a loamy sand in field crop rotation retained significantly greater vwc after the second application of oma and awc increase as much as 45 with some oma sources foley and cooperband 2002 few studies have examined soil water retention as a function of oma in permanent crops despite the lack of significant differences in vwc and soc during 2017 we observed significantly higher soil water retention with fall applied cm after the 2017 growing season our findings are well supported by studies that find oma improves soil water retention and awc in dry climates di prima et al 2018 eden et al 2017 li et al 2017 and small increases in som can have a marked effect on awc in course textured soils foley and cooperband 2002 gulser and candemir 2015 weber et al 2007 greater soil water retention at the 0 10 cm depth combined with higher vwc at 0 150 cm depth observed in fall applied cm suggests enhanced water retention in the topsoil may lead to higher vwc in the subsoil oma applied as mulch in no till systems tends to have the greatest effect on soil physical properties in the topsoil mays et al 2014 oliveira and merwin 2001 maintaining adequate soil moisture in topsoil benefits microbial communities which improves soil structure nutrient cycling and plant stress resilience six et al 2004 timmusk et al 2014 and is important for fine root production which facilitates nutrient and water uptake maximum water uptake by almond trees occurs at 20 30 cm depth koumanov et al 2006 vrugt et al 2001 implying the greatest root activity is in topsoil enhanced water retention in the topsoil may lead to higher vwc in the subsoil which can mitigate water stress in permanent crops li et al 2017 soil awc generally improves with oma use but the magnitude of these effects depends on climate and soil types hudson 1994 demonstrated soils with higher soc had significantly greater awc and estimated an increase of 2 2 to 3 7 with every 1 increase in soc eden et al 2017 results from oma studies vary widely some report increases up to 86 in awc on marginal or sandy soils celik et al 2004 foley and cooperband 2002 and others report an increase in vwc at field capacity but no difference in awc carter 2007 gulser and candemir 2015 miller et al 2015 long term annual application of manure over greater than 7 years resulted in a 2 increase in awc for every 10 mg c ha 1 applied with a persistent impact for 2 years after the last application bhogal et al 2011 other studies report short term increases in awc with oma jordan et al 2010 weber et al 2007 while others showed no effect of oma on awc deurer et al 2008 water retention in the fall applied cm and control treatments differed enough to suggest higher awc with fall applied cm as evidenced by higher vwc and swp from fall applied cm during periods of low soil moisture improved awc with oma could help sustain tree growth in drought years and during periods of moisture deficit and potentially delay or reduce the need for irrigation thereby reducing orchard water use 3 3 tree water status 3 3 1 seasonal swp patterns the seasonal pattern in swp differed between 2016 and 2017 in the treatments and control fig 4 average monthly swp was 0 07 to 0 25 mpa more negative from may to august 2016 compared to the same period in 2017 p 0 01 in 2016 swp peaked in july 2016 at 0 97 mpa below baseline in 2017 swp was less than 0 70 mpa below baseline for most of the growing season and most negative 1 07 mpa in september 2017 patterns in soil moisture were reflected in measurements of swp where increases and decreases in vwc equated with lower and higher tree water stress respectively swp was 32 less negative in 2016 compared with 2017 high water stress of 1 1 mpa average swp below baseline in september 2017 coincided with deficit irrigation to dry the orchard floor prior to harvest swp of 1 0 mpa below baseline is thought to be the threshold for onset of growth limiting water stress in almonds espadafor et al 2017 though shackel et al 1998 report a 50 reduction in tree circumference at 0 85 mpa swp below baseline moderate water deficit has been shown to reduce growth of prunus spp de la rosa et al 2016 perez pastor et al 2014 which could reduce future productivity forey et al 2016 shackel et al 1998 maximum vegetative growth is important during orchard establishment to hasten onset of yield in young trees goldhamer et al 1999 our findings suggest oma use in young orchards could have a long term impact on future orchard productivity due to a reduction in water stress at a critical point in tree life 3 3 2 effects of composted manure monthly average swp was 0 03 to 0 15 mpa less negative from cm compared to the control during the majority of 2016 and 2017 but the effects were not significant in any month p 0 05 fig 4 fall applied cm had the lowest water stress from june to september 2016 which averaged 0 13 mpa less than the control monthly average swp was similar for all treatments from may to august 2017 with no apparent trends among treatments in september 2017 when deficit irrigation was applied to facilitate harvest overall water stress levels increased sharply yet fall applied cm trees were the least stressed the consistent pattern of lower tree stress observed in fall applied cm trees in 2016 correlates with the pattern of treatment effects on vwc fig 2 fig 4 measures of tree water status reflect interrelationships among soil climate and crop factors gomez del campo 2013 as a result changes in soil moisture from oma may not be detected by a swp response however lordan et al 2015 reported less water stress in peach trees mulched with compost with greater differences in year two of the trial the trends observed in swp indicate oma application in fall could reduce tree water stress more than spring application and the correlation of increasing vwc and decreasing swp from fall applied cm relative to the control suggests increased awc from cm facilitated greater tree water uptake in fall applied cm trees water stress trended lowest and swp was 14 higher than the control in months when the mean vwc was less than 10 whereas there was no trend in months when the mean vwc was greater than 10 these differences could be related to greater soil water retention with fall applied cm which increased soil water availability when moisture was limiting this observation supports our conclusion that oma use could increase drought resilience of permanent crops 4 conclusion efficient use of water resources from irrigation and precipitation is important for the long term productivity of permanent crops in drought prone regions like california oma enhanced vwc and soil water retention in the tree rooting zone increased soc and decreased tree water stress especially when applied in fall fall application of oma which led to more complete decomposition and greater c stabilization during winter months could contribute to higher som accumulation and vwc compared to spring application the strongest effects of oma were observed in drier soils and during periods of high water demand therefore oma use during orchard establishment or when water supply is limited can increase tree resilience leading to greater assurance of productivity over the long term funding

10959,permanent crops like almond prunus dulcis require significant water inputs for economic yields and long term productivity this demand creates a challenge in drought prone regions like california use of organic matter amendments oma can improve water use efficiency by conserving soil moisture and reducing tree water stress the majority of almond orchards in california are no till with irrigation targeted on a narrow tree berm where oma is applied as surface mulch we examined the effects of composted dairy manure cm and the timing of its application on soil moisture soil water retention and tree water status in a young orchard planted in 2014 treatments including fall applied cm october 2015 and 2016 spring applied cm april 2016 and 2017 and an unamended control were monitored during the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons fall applied cm was more readily incorporated in soil organic matter of the 0 60 cm rooting zone as evidenced by significantly greater soil organic carbon soc for fall versus spring applied cm in 2016 p 0 05 fall applied cm significantly increased soil volumetric water content vwc by 22 from 0 to 150 cm depth during the driest period of year one and tended to make midday stem water potential swp less negative relative to the control fall applied cm tended to increase vwc in 2017 but treatment differences were no longer significant differences in vwc and swp between fall applied cm and the control were most apparent at low vwc 10 two years of fall applied cm increased soil water retention between 0 to 100 kpa at 0 10 cm depth by 13 compared to the control these results demonstrate fall applied cm was more effective at enhancing soil moisture retention and reducing tree water stress compared to spring applied cm we also conclude oma use may buffer against periods of limited water supply for young trees keywords composted manure application timing neutron probe stem water potential almond 1 introduction sustainable water use in permanent crops is a priority in regions of high water demand like california california s central valley hosts the world s largest region of permanent crops where orchards and vineyards comprise 13 of agricultural acreage and produces 80 of almonds worldwide cdfa 2017 usda 2016 irrigated tree crops account for 34 of agricultural water use in california after dairy farming nut crops are the highest net water users defined as water applied minus runoff and leaching johnson and cody 2015 climate change increases the likelihood of more frequent and high intensity droughts swain et al 2018 and given the high dependency of permanent crops on water resources it is critical to increase water conservation and water use efficiency particularly for intensively grown crops such as almond management practices to improve soil water storage and increase water availability during critical growth periods may lead to irrigation water savings and increase orchard resilience during drought events use of organic matter amendments oma such as composted manure cm in orchards is a promising strategy to enhance water use efficiency lordan et al 2015 reganold et al 2001 california is the number one dairy producing state with over 1300 registered dairies cdfa 2017 manure produced by dairies is an abundant oma source available to growers in california s central valley in a survey of oma practices 40 of oma users identified soil water holding capacity as a primary or secondary benefit of oma use khalsa and brown 2017 in california almond orchards are predominantly no till and equipped with microirrigation where water is applied on a narrow tree berm allowing for targeted wetting of soil with tree roots smart et al 2011 tindula et al 2013 as a result oma application is often as a surface mulch placed in the same wetted area in order to facilitate decomposition the effect of oma on soil moisture and tree water status in no till partially wetted orchards is uncertain and even

oma lordan et al 2015 it is reasonable to ascertain that management practices such as oma use that increase soil moisture retention will also reduce tree water stress and ultimately improve tree growth and long term orchard productivity this study examines the impact of oma and application timing on soil and tree water status under conditions where oma is applied as mulch and wetted by irrigation during the growing season the aim of this research was to quantify the impact of fall applied and spring applied composted dairy manure cm on volumetric water content vwc soil water retention and tree water status compared to an unamended control we hypothesize som accumulation during oma decomposition will enhance vwc and soil water retention with subsequent impacts on tree water status we also predict higher vwc and tree swp with fall applied cm compared to spring applied cm due to greater c incorporation into som during the winter months prior to the growing season 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the experimental site was a 3rd and 4th leaf almond prunus dulcis orchard during 2016 and 2017 in san joaquin county california 37 49 33 n 121 6 46 w on manteca fine sandy loam mixed thermic typic durixeroll the region has a mediterranean climate with an average annual temperature of 17 c and average annual rainfall 450 mm with most precipitation occurring between october and april the orchard was planted in 2014 at a density of 272 tree ha 1 with 5 5 m tree and 6 7 m row spacings of the cultivar nonpareil and alternating rows of the cultivars aldridge and carmel all trees were grafted on hanson rootstock a native duripan soil layer observed at 120 150 cm depth was ripped prior to planting the trees were irrigated using one microsprinkler per tree each with a 3 m radius and a flow rate of 47 l hr 1 the grower managed the orchard using standard irrigation nutrient pest and weed control practices for california almond orchards duncan et al 2016 the trees were first harvested in 2017 during the second year of our trial the grower managed orchard received 47 more water inputs in the 2017 growing season from april to october than in 2016 growing season fig 1 low vwc in september 2017 was a result of deficit irrigation to dry down the orchard floor prior to harvest operations historical climate data were acquired from the cimis california irrigation management information system station located 9 8 km from our field study site in manteca ca cimis 2018 cumulative monthly reference evapotranspiration eto from may 1st to october 1st was similar in 2016 and 2017 fig 1 with the highest eto measured in june and july in both years the experimental design was a randomized complete split block design with four blocks and two main plot treatments main plots received oma treatments applied with cm or an unamended control and subplots were timing of oma as either fall applied in october 2015 and 2016 prior to the subsequent growing season or spring applied in april 2016 and 2017 during the growing season for a total of 12 plots map 1 duplicate samples were taken at two locations per plot which were randomly selected from a row length of 660 m cm with a c to n ratio c n of 11 1 was applied annually at the equivalent rate of 9 mg ha 1 at 30 moisture as a surface mulch on the tree berm the control was managed using synthetic fertilizer injected in split applications through the microsprinkler irrigation system all plots received the same rate of water and fertilizer 2 2 field measurements aluminum neutron probe access tubes were installed to 1 5 m depth to monitor soil moisture during the growing season from april to october soil moisture was measured using a cpn 503tdr hydroprobe instrotek inc concord ca hydroprobe counts measured soil moisture of a 20 30 cm radius sphere and measurements were taken at 30 cm increments from 30 to 150 cm depth measurements were collected at 2 week intervals between 1 to 3 days before irrigation events to represent drier periods in the growing season and to minimize the variation due to irrigation missing data from october 2017 were the result of conflicting field operations during installation of access tubes soil samples were collected using a madera sampler to determine bulk density and vwc for hydroprobe calibration the hydroprobe count ratio was fitted to a linear calibration equation r2 0 83 to convert the count ratio to vwc dickey et al 1993 irrigation emitter flow rate was measured in all plots and equaled 41 5 l hr 1 0 41 in 2016 and 36 4 l hr 1 1 16 in 2017 distribution uniformity du was calculated using the ratio of average flow rate of lowest ¼ of the orchard and average flow rate of the whole orchard and equaled 92 7 in 2016 and 80 6 in 2017 tree midday stem water potential swp was measured on trees within the same plots where access tubes were installed using a model 3000 pressure chamber soil moisture equipment corp goleta ca readings were taken midday between 1 00 to 3 00 pm on the same day as soil moisture measurements a leaf from a shaded position near the trunk was selected and bagged for a minimum of 10 min prior to recording the swp measurement swp was measured from may to september when mature healthy leaves were available baseline swp swp for a fully irrigated almond tree was determined using the relative humidity and temperature measured at the field site on each day swp measurements were performed and calculated following mccutchan and shackel 1992 swp values are reported as the difference from the baseline a modified litter bag technique referred to here as litter rings was utilized to estimate decomposition of cm on tree berms as total mass loss of cm during the study period pre weighed amendments were contained in a pvc pipe 30 cm diameter by 2 54 cm high with coarse mesh netting 0 08 cm openings attached to the pvc pipe bottom and pinned on top of the soil in august 2016 and 2017 litter rings were collected and weighed to estimate cm decomposition during october 2016 and 2017 soil beneath litter rings from 0 to 60 cm depth were sampled ground de carbonated and analyzed for total soil organic carbon soc harris et al 2001 brown and sanden unpublished data estimated the active rooting zone for almond trees under microirrigation to be between 20 60 cm depth and vrugt et al 2001 determined almond tree water uptake under microirrigation occurred from 0 to 40 cm depth uniformity of soil texture was confirmed between experimental plots to 1 5 m depth by the rapid sieving technique kettler et al 2001 2 3 water retention curves water retention curves were constructed using the simplified evaporation method peters and durner 2008 undisturbed soil samples were collected from fall applied cm and control plots in january 2018 from the 0 10 cm soil layer using 250 ml stainless steel rings at 30 cm from neutron probe access tubes samples were covered with plastic caps stored at 4 c and processed within approximately 10 weeks of collection samples were saturated in a pan of water via capillary action after which two precision tensiometers housed in a cylindrical pressure sensing unit hyprop ums gmbh munich germany were inserted into each samples with sensor units were placed on a digital balance and left to dry gradually via evaporation at room temperature 28 c while water potential pressure head and sample mass were continuously recorded in the hyprop fit software v 3 5 1 13951 pertassek et al 2015 water retention curves were fit using the modified van genuchten model for soil hydraulic properties van genuchten 1980 given in eq 1 below 1 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m where θ is volumetric water content mm3 mm 3 θr is residual volumetric water content θs is saturated volumetric water content h is soil water potential kpa α is a scaling parameter inversely proportional to the mean pore diameter cm 1 and n and m are shaping parameters 2 4 statistical analyses soil moisture and midday swp analyses were conducted using a mixed effects model structured for repeated measures on log transformed data and soc and oma decomposition analyses were conducted by anova and a tukey test using sas 9 4 sas institute cary nc vwc measurements below 150 cm depth were erratic perhaps due to remnants of a duripan layer and therefore eliminated from statistical analyses we averaged vwc across depth in the root zone as the depth by treatment interaction was not significant p 0 05 optimal shaping and scaling parameters for van genuchten soil water retention curves were determined using port routines in the stats package of r gay 1990 to minimize root mean square error a lag element was included in the statistical model to account for residual autocorrelation and non independence across time the response variable was normalized by overall mean to account for different initial saturated water contents among samples a linear model with the optimized van genuchten model and the lag element as explanatory variables was run for pooled both treatments combined as fixed effect and grouped treatment as fixed effect data comparative model fit between the two structures was evaluated using the akaike information criterion aic and mallow s cp metrics to test whether the van genuchten model parameters were significantly different between treatments i e whether the model grouped by treatment was any more informative than the pooled model 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil moisture 3 1 1 seasonal soil moisture patterns soil moisture from 0 to 150 cm depth averaged across treatments and years decreased by 47 over the duration of the growing season fig 2 in 2016 the vwc dropped 38 from april to june and we observed relatively dry soil conditions with an average of 0 09 cm3 cm 3 from july to october in 2017 vwc decreased uniformly from april to september these results are expected because almond trees deplete soil water reserves by mid to late summer and high et during june to august drives water loss from soil and leaf surfaces shackel et al 1997 the overall average vwc was 20 less in 2016 than the average vwc in 2017 and the average monthly vwc ranged from 12 to 20 lower in 2016 compared to 2017 except in september when soil was similarly dry these differences can be attributed to differing water management in a non harvest 2016 and harvest 2017 year 3 1 2 effects of composted manure soil moisture from 0 to 150 cm depth was 8 2 22 higher with cm relative to the control when averaged by month and treatment fig 2 fall applied cm showed the highest mean vwc in all months except april 2016 and was significantly greater than the control from july to october 2016 we measured the largest significant difference between treatments in july 2016 with 24 higher vwc in fall applied cm compared to the control the fall and spring timing treatments were not significantly different at p 0 05 soil moisture in 2017 exhibited similar trends as 2016 but treatment differences were smaller and no longer significant fig 2 soil soc was significantly higher in the fall applied cm compared to spring in 2016 but we observed no differences in 2017 table 1 the lack of a significant difference in 2017 for vwc may be related to increased irrigation or it could be due to lower du of irrigated water in 2017 compared to 2016 which was 80 6 and 92 7 respectively greater soc for fall applied cm likely played a role in the observed significant differences in vwc between fall applied cm and the control fig 2 table 1 an increase in som as well as improved soil structure mays et al 2015 oliveira and merwin 2001 following oma has also been observed in a variety of cropping systems including permanent crops hannam et al 2016 lopez et al 2014 peck et al 2011 higher som from oma in orchards also correlated with higher soil water infiltration and hydraulic conductivity goh et al 2001 lordan et al 2015 merwin et al 1994 studies with permanent crops support the observed increase in vwc in fall applied cm being the result of som accumulation improving soil structure leading to greater water infiltration and soil water retention the findings of this study are well aligned with the majority of permanent crop studies demonstrating enhanced soil moisture from oma use yet the magnitude of the effect may depend on the oma source there is strong evidence that oma with a c n ratio greater than 30 1 significantly increase soil water infiltration and reduce surface evaporation in orchards goh et al 2001 lordan et al 2015 zribi et al 2015 the c n ratio of cm from this trial 11 1 was lower than other organic mulches such as straw 75 1 and bark 200 1 bernal et al 2017 gale et al 2006 apples orchards treated with bark had higher vwc than untreated orchards granatstein and mullinix 2008 while straw mulch increased walsh et al 1996 or had no effect on vwc oliveira and merwin 2001 there is less evidence for increased soil moisture with oma sources with c n less than 30 1 hannam et al 2016 studies in apple walsh et al 1996 and california winegrape bound 2014 report significantly higher soil water content with straw and bark mulch compared to a control but no difference with cm oma with c n greater than 30 1 is more resistant to microbial decomposition and provides physical protection to the soil surface thereby reducing surface evaporation and improving water infiltration the effects of oma sources with c n less than 30 1 are likely related to som accumulation rather than physical protection of the soil surface and tend to be observed in low som soils du et al 2015 mays et al 2015 like many orchard soils in california our results demonstrate that the effect of oma timing on soil moisture alters soil and tree response as evidenced by fall applied cm increasing soil moisture more significantly than spring applied cm table 1 overwintering and greater decomposition of fall applied cm compared to spring applied cm in 2016 and significantly greater decomposition of fall applied cm in 2017 table 2 likely resulted in greater c stabilization in som multiple studies showed cool temperatures reduce the rate of c mineralization of oma ding et al 2007 nicolardot et al 1994 qi et al 2016 whereas warm soil temperatures and adequate moisture accelerated microbial mineralization of soc blanke 1997 lomander et al 1998 as oma undergoes decomposition a fraction of labile c is transformed into more complex less degradable c forms curtin et al 1998 grandy and neff 2008 prescott 2010 decomposition under cooler temperatures may enhance c stabilization derived from cm and increase resistance to mineralization during subsequent growing seasons fall applied cm increased som compared to spring applied cm and hence may be more effective in enhancing infiltration and soil moisture retention significant differences p 0 05 in vwc between fall applied cm and the control were observed in 2016 when orchard soils were drier and in months with maximum soil water depletion fig 2 similarly fall applied cm had greater som compared to spring applied cm in a dry year 2016 but not in a wetter year 2017 due to more intensive irrigation together these findings suggest that cm has a greater effect on vwc in drier years and that this effect is due to lower soil c mineralization in drier years current literature suggests oma has a stronger effect on soil moisture in dry climates and during periods of high tree water uptake granatstein and mullinix 2008 merwin et al 1994 walsh et al 1996 in orchards in an arid and semi arid climate higher soil moisture du et al 2015 and awc li et al 2017 was observed in plots with oma potential water retention with oma in dry soils has clear implications for orchard resilience to drought and suggests the greater benefit from oma use may be during years when irrigation supply is limited 3 2 soil water retention the fall applied cm treatment maintained an average of 13 more vwc between 50 150 kpa in the plant available range than the control fig 3 the best linear model for water retention showed a significant increase in vwc with fall applied cm across all measured matric potentials i e from saturation to slightly beyond field capacity t 3 84 p 0 001 model fit showed improvement with the inclusion of a grouped treatment effect and a lag element to account for auto correlation of sequential measurements indicating that coefficients for the van genuchten function differed for curves between fall applied cm and the control thus although our equipment could not measure water content at the permanent wilting point we suspect the curves would differ enough between field capacity and permanent wilting point to create differences in awc between fall applied cm and the control fall applied cm had a significant effect on soil water retention in the topsoil 0 10 cm depth and retained higher vwc than the control at matric potentials between 0 and 100 kpa fig 3 numerous studies found oma significantly increased soil water retention at saturation and field capacity carter 2007 logsdon and malone 2015 weber et al 2007 water potentials at which som most strongly influences soil moisture hudson 1994 minasny and mcbratney 2018a rawls et al 2003 a clay loam soil amended with cm had higher soil water retention at field capacity which also correlated with lower bulk density and higher porosity compared to an unamended control miller et al 2015 at field capacity soil water is retained in structural macropores 30 microns and improvement in water retention with fall applied cm at field capacity can likely be attributed to macroaggregate formation and stabilization associated with the 10 increase in soc relative to the control in 2017 eden et al 2017 rabot et al 2018 climate soil texture and management factors strongly influence som dynamics and oma effects on soil water retention vary across environmental and agronomic conditions use of oma tends to have the greatest effect on soil water retention of course textured sandy soils with a low initial som content foley and cooperband 2002 gulser and candemir 2015 weber et al 2007 similar to the soil type in this study a loamy sand in field crop rotation retained significantly greater vwc after the second application of oma and awc increase as much as 45 with some oma sources foley and cooperband 2002 few studies have examined soil water retention as a function of oma in permanent crops despite the lack of significant differences in vwc and soc during 2017 we observed significantly higher soil water retention with fall applied cm after the 2017 growing season our findings are well supported by studies that find oma improves soil water retention and awc in dry climates di prima et al 2018 eden et al 2017 li et al 2017 and small increases in som can have a marked effect on awc in course textured soils foley and cooperband 2002 gulser and candemir 2015 weber et al 2007 greater soil water retention at the 0 10 cm depth combined with higher vwc at 0 150 cm depth observed in fall applied cm suggests enhanced water retention in the topsoil may lead to higher vwc in the subsoil oma applied as mulch in no till systems tends to have the greatest effect on soil physical properties in the topsoil mays et al 2014 oliveira and merwin 2001 maintaining adequate soil moisture in topsoil benefits microbial communities which improves soil structure nutrient cycling and plant stress resilience six et al 2004 timmusk et al 2014 and is important for fine root production which facilitates nutrient and water uptake maximum water uptake by almond trees occurs at 20 30 cm depth koumanov et al 2006 vrugt et al 2001 implying the greatest root activity is in topsoil enhanced water retention in the topsoil may lead to higher vwc in the subsoil which can mitigate water stress in permanent crops li et al 2017 soil awc generally improves with oma use but the magnitude of these effects depends on climate and soil types hudson 1994 demonstrated soils with higher soc had significantly greater awc and estimated an increase of 2 2 to 3 7 with every 1 increase in soc eden et al 2017 results from oma studies vary widely some report increases up to 86 in awc on marginal or sandy soils celik et al 2004 foley and cooperband 2002 and others report an increase in vwc at field capacity but no difference in awc carter 2007 gulser and candemir 2015 miller et al 2015 long term annual application of manure over greater than 7 years resulted in a 2 increase in awc for every 10 mg c ha 1 applied with a persistent impact for 2 years after the last application bhogal et al 2011 other studies report short term increases in awc with oma jordan et al 2010 weber et al 2007 while others showed no effect of oma on awc deurer et al 2008 water retention in the fall applied cm and control treatments differed enough to suggest higher awc with fall applied cm as evidenced by higher vwc and swp from fall applied cm during periods of low soil moisture improved awc with oma could help sustain tree growth in drought years and during periods of moisture deficit and potentially delay or reduce the need for irrigation thereby reducing orchard water use 3 3 tree water status 3 3 1 seasonal swp patterns the seasonal pattern in swp differed between 2016 and 2017 in the treatments and control fig 4 average monthly swp was 0 07 to 0 25 mpa more negative from may to august 2016 compared to the same period in 2017 p 0 01 in 2016 swp peaked in july 2016 at 0 97 mpa below baseline in 2017 swp was less than 0 70 mpa below baseline for most of the growing season and most negative 1 07 mpa in september 2017 patterns in soil moisture were reflected in measurements of swp where increases and decreases in vwc equated with lower and higher tree water stress respectively swp was 32 less negative in 2016 compared with 2017 high water stress of 1 1 mpa average swp below baseline in september 2017 coincided with deficit irrigation to dry the orchard floor prior to harvest swp of 1 0 mpa below baseline is thought to be the threshold for onset of growth limiting water stress in almonds espadafor et al 2017 though shackel et al 1998 report a 50 reduction in tree circumference at 0 85 mpa swp below baseline moderate water deficit has been shown to reduce growth of prunus spp de la rosa et al 2016 perez pastor et al 2014 which could reduce future productivity forey et al 2016 shackel et al 1998 maximum vegetative growth is important during orchard establishment to hasten onset of yield in young trees goldhamer et al 1999 our findings suggest oma use in young orchards could have a long term impact on future orchard productivity due to a reduction in water stress at a critical point in tree life 3 3 2 effects of composted manure monthly average swp was 0 03 to 0 15 mpa less negative from cm compared to the control during the majority of 2016 and 2017 but the effects were not significant in any month p 0 05 fig 4 fall applied cm had the lowest water stress from june to september 2016 which averaged 0 13 mpa less than the control monthly average swp was similar for all treatments from may to august 2017 with no apparent trends among treatments in september 2017 when deficit irrigation was applied to facilitate harvest overall water stress levels increased sharply yet fall applied cm trees were the least stressed the consistent pattern of lower tree stress observed in fall applied cm trees in 2016 correlates with the pattern of treatment effects on vwc fig 2 fig 4 measures of tree water status reflect interrelationships among soil climate and crop factors gomez del campo 2013 as a result changes in soil moisture from oma may not be detected by a swp response however lordan et al 2015 reported less water stress in peach trees mulched with compost with greater differences in year two of the trial the trends observed in swp indicate oma application in fall could reduce tree water stress more than spring application and the correlation of increasing vwc and decreasing swp from fall applied cm relative to the control suggests increased awc from cm facilitated greater tree water uptake in fall applied cm trees water stress trended lowest and swp was 14 higher than the control in months when the mean vwc was less than 10 whereas there was no trend in months when the mean vwc was greater than 10 these differences could be related to greater soil water retention with fall applied cm which increased soil water availability when moisture was limiting this observation supports our conclusion that oma use could increase drought resilience of permanent crops 4 conclusion efficient use of water resources from irrigation and precipitation is important for the long term productivity of permanent crops in drought prone regions like california oma enhanced vwc and soil water retention in the tree rooting zone increased soc and decreased tree water stress especially when applied in fall fall application of oma which led to more complete decomposition and greater c stabilization during winter months could contribute to higher som accumulation and vwc compared to spring application the strongest effects of oma were observed in drier soils and during periods of high water demand therefore oma use during orchard establishment or when water supply is limited can increase tree resilience leading to greater assurance of productivity over the long term funding
