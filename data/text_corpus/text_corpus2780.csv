13900,biochar is a promising heterogeneous catalyst for wastewater treatment and its efficiency can be improved via modification with iron oxide we used food waste as a raw material for the preparation of magnetic biochar mc and the mc containing maghemite was successfully prepared via a pre pyrolysis process the mc was used as a catalyst for heterogeneous fenton like processes to remove organic dyes from water and the synergistic effects of ultrasound us were evaluated the heterogeneous sono fenton like triple us h2o2 catalyst system exhibited a high dye removal efficiency the calculated synergy factors were 5 73 for methylene blue mb and 10 95 for methyl orange mo the dye removal efficiency increased with the h2o2 concentration catalyst dose and ultrasonic power when the catalyst was reused five times the removal efficiency for mb was maintained above 84 whereas that for mo was reduced to 10 the removal efficiency was also evaluated in real textile wastewater keywords magnetic biochar food waste ultrasound heterogenous fenton textile wastewater 1 introduction dye is one of the worst organic pollutants derived from paper textile cosmetic and food industry effluents 1 the release of dyes alters the clarity of water even in trace amounts which interferes with light diffusion and affects the photosynthesis of aquatic plants and poses a great threat to aquatic life and human beings due to their toxicity mutagenic and carcinogenic and poor biodegradability 2 3 various physicochemical techniques such as adsorption membrane filtration precipitation and coagulation have been used for the decolorization process 4 6 however these approaches only collect or transfer the dye molecules from aqueous phase to another thus cannot completely remove pollutants 2 therefore many studies have recently been conducted using advanced oxidation processes aops to destroy organic pollutants such as dyes in various wastewaters including uv h2o2 3 uv tio2 7 and heterogeneous sono fenton processes 8 biochar which is derived from various types of waste such as sewage sludge 9 corncobs 10 litchi peels 11 manure 12 and food waste 13 is an excellent adsorbent for wastewater treatment in addition to its adsorption capacity recent research revealed that biochar is a promising heterogeneous catalyst for wastewater treatment fang et al 14 reported that biochar activates persulfate producing sulfate radicals and efficiently breaking down polychlorinated biphenyls wang and wang 15 found that sludge derived biochar can activate peroxymonosulfate producing sulfate radicals for the degradation of triclosan in wastewater nevertheless to satisfy the requirements of wastewater treatment it is necessary to improve the catalytic performance of biochar through various activation techniques and modification with iron oxide can be an effective and widely adoptable solution 16 17 generally iron impregnation is performed by immersing biochar post pyrolysis or its feedstock pre pyrolysis in a nitrate or chloride salt solution followed by heating to a temperature of 50 300 c to release nitrates or chlorides as no2 and cl2 gases and convert iron ions into iron oxides 18 the produced biochar can be used as a catalyst in the heterogeneous fenton like oxidation process for dyeing wastewater treatment and can be easily recovered through magnetic separation after being used as a magnetic biochar mc in water treatment 17 19 since the formation of hydroxyl radicals using ultrasound in aqueous solutions was first reported 20 we have witnessed the proliferation of ultrasound us applications for removing organic contaminants from water because of its ability to produce hydroxyl radicals sonolysis us which is considered an advanced oxidation process aop has inherent advantages over other aops e g no chemical reagent is needed and the materials are easy to handle 21 22 however sonolysis generally has a low level of mineralization 10 as the resulting product is hydrophilic and nonvolatile which limits its complete removal and ultrasonic waves incur a relatively high cost owing to the high electrical energy consumption 21 these drawbacks can be overcome by combining sonolysis with other aops such as sono photocatalysis 23 sono fenton reactions 24 and sono electrochemistry 25 such combinations enhance the production of reactive radicals leading to synergistic effects and accelerating the degradation of contaminants few studies have been performed on the use of biochar as a catalyst in the heterogeneous sono fenton like process to remove organic pollutants 26 and the derivation of mc from food waste has not been reported therefore in this study food waste derived mc was prepared via a pre pyrolysis method and characterized including its magnetic properties the synergistic effects of the biochar catalyst us and h2o2 on the removal of organic dyes from aqueous solutions in a heterogeneous sono fenton like process were evaluated the effects of the initial h2o2 concentration catalyst dose ultrasonic power initial dye concentration and solution ph were examined additionally the effects of different scavengers on the dye removal and the reusability of the catalyst were investigated 2 material and methods 2 1 materials food waste was obtained from a food waste disposal facility in seoul korea

than 0 15 mm 100 sieve washed with di water to remove impurities and then dried in a vacuum oven ftvo 701 sci finetech korea at 70 c prior to use 2 3 experimental procedure all experiments involving us were performed with 10 ml of mb and mo solutions in 12 ml glass tubes glass tubes containing individual samples were sealed with parafilm m parafilm bemis usa a basic bath type ultrasonic generator elmasonic p 30 h elma germany equipped with a single transducer was used at a frequency of 37 khz the intensity of the ultrasonic power transmitted to the bath was adjusted to power per volume w l using calorimetry which involved measurement of the initial rate of a temperature rise produced by ultrasound irradiation fig s1 the experiments were conducted with 2 g l mc and 200 mm h2o2 and these amounts were changed in the operating parameter tests the temperature of the ultrasonic bath was not adjusted and ranged from 18 to 62 c depending on the ultrasonic power and irradiation time in the experiments without us a shaking incubator sj 808sf sejong science co korea was used at 120 rpm and the experiments were performed at 25 c all the samples were filtered 25hp020an advantec japan and subjected to measurements each filtered sample was diluted with di water for measurement the diluted sample concentration was measured using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer neo s2117 neogen korea the concentrations of mb and mo were measured at 660 and 465 nm respectively which were the λmax values table 1 all experiments were performed in triplicate and one tailed t test was used to determine statistically significant differences between treatments at the 95 confidence level p 0 05 2 4 analytical methods the magnetic properties of the biochar were measured using a vibrating sample

oxygen demand cod and hardness were also evaluated according to standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 29 2 5 artificial neural network ann modeling a three layer feed forward multilayer perceptron artificial neural network ann was applied to simulate the results the initial h2o2 concentration catalyst dose ultrasonic power and solution ph were chosen as the neurons of input layer to optimize the structure of ann the number of neurons in hidden layer were varied from 6 to 12 output layer was consisted with the one neuron removal efficiency input values were rescaled min max normalized as follows eq 1 1 x i x i m i n x max x m i n x where xi is the rescaled i th value in variable x xi is the original i th value in variable x min x is the minimum value of variable x and max x is the maximum value of variable x the transfer functions of hidden and output layer were a hyperbolic tangent sigmoid transfer function tansig and linear transfer function purelin the optimization of ann with above structure was performed with matlab 2019b mathworks usa by the mean square error mse minimization from validation set 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of mc the morphology and chemical composition of the surface of the mc were measured via field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds fig s2 the iron precipitate covered the biochar surface in an aggregated manner as transition metals such as iron tend to aggregate on the surface of composites 30 31 successful iron loading on the biochar derived from food waste was confirmed by the high intensity fe peaks 48 80 0 29 wt for the prepared sample which also contained significant amounts of c 35 93 0 33 wt and o 14 56 0 17 wt the crystalline structure of the prepared sample was investigated via x ray diffraction xrd analysis fig 1 a the strong and sharp peaks indicated that the iron oxide produced in the biochar matrix was highly crystallized the diffraction peaks at approximately 2θ 30 34 35 76 43 46 53 94 57 54 and 63 08 correspond to the 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 planes respectively of the cubic structure of maghemite jcpds no 39 1364 32 this magnetic iron oxide contained in magnetic biochar could be used as a heterogeneous catalyst for the sono fenton process to treat textile wastewaters 8 33 and the band gap of mc estimated by the tauc plot αhν 2 k hν eg was 2 1 ev fig s3 which is due to the influence of formed iron oxide on the biochar surface 34 35 the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curve of the mc are presented in fig s4 the prepared sample exhibited a mesoporous structure and the specific surface area and pore volume were analyzed as shown in table s1 the specific surface area was determined to be 68 555 m2 g via the brunauer emmett teller bet method the pore size distribution calculated from the desorption branch via the barrett joyner halenda bjh method exhibited a bimodal distribution with a narrow distribution centered at 4 nm and a wide distribution centered at 10 nm these bimodal distributions are attributed to the interspaces between the biochar and aggregated maghemite particles the surface functional groups of the mc were investigated via ftir spectroscopy fig s5 the broad peak at approximately 3200 cm 1in the spectrum corresponds to the oh stretching vibration of alcohols phenols and carboxylic acid groups 36 the peak at 1594 cm 1 corresponds to the cc stretching of the aromatic ring and the peak at 1374 cm 1 is related to aliphatic ch 37 38 the band at 540 cm 1 is attributed to the feo vibration 16 39 the magnetic properties of the sample were measured using a vsm fig 1 b the mc had a magnetic saturation of approximately 43 8 emu g which was sufficient 16 3 emu g for it to be manipulated using an external magnetic field e g a conventional magnet fig 1 c 40 3 2 comparison of different processes for dye removal the degradation of organic dyes over time was compared in different processes involving single us h2o2 mc dual us h2o2 us mc h2o2 mc and triple us h2o2 mc systems as shown in fig 2 the single processes of sonolysis us and h2o2 oxidation were not effective for removing either dye from the solution only 10 mb mb 0 50 mg l was removed by us after 180 min while the h2o2 oxidation was negligible in contrast 70 mb was removed after 180 min via a single adsorption mc process this is because the mb was easily adsorbed on the heterogeneous surfaces of the mc 31 41 the adsorption of mo which is an anionic dye on biochar is generally weaker than that of mb which is a cationic dye 10 42 accordingly only 22 of mo mo 0 50 mg l was removed by the adsorption process for the same reaction time fig 2 the degradation of the dyes with the us h2o2 system was nearly identical to that with the us system 11 for mb and 10 for mo indicating that the us was ineffective for promoting the decomposition of h2o2 into reactive radicals under the experimental conditions the removal of the dyes with the h2o2 mc system 68 for mb and 29 for mo was similar to that with the single mc system p 0 05 the combination of us with the mc us mc system enhanced the dye removal 93 for mb and 31 for mo this enhanced adsorption can be attributed to the mass transfer from the liquid phase to the solid pores and the creation of new adsorption sites on the surface resulting from the sonication 43 44 furthermore the presence of mc could provide additional active sites for nucleation of bubbles 1 45 interestingly the us assisted h2o2 mc system us h2o2 mc exhibited synergistic effects on the dye removal with this triple system 90 of the mb was removed after 30 min and 100 was removed after 60 min additionally 95 of the mo was removed after 180 min these results are attributed to the synergistic effects of the us and mc on the decomposition of h2o2 into ho the reactions for the us h2o2 mc system are postulated as follows 2 h 2 o 2 u s 2 h o 3 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 h o h o 4 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 h o 2 h 5 f e 3 h o 2 f e 2 o 2 h 6 o r g a n i c d y e s h o d e g r a d e d p r o d u c t s first h2o2 molecules were decomposed by us irradiation in the presence of mc as a catalyst producing ho eq 2 46 47 simultaneously the fenton catalytic reaction between the mc and h2o2 was facilitated by the us treatment eq 3 48 additionally the oxidized ferric iron was reduced to ferrous iron by the reaction with h2o2 and hydrogen peroxide radicals ho2 eqs 4 and 5 24 49 the ferrous iron could be reused in subsequent fenton reactions finally the hydroxyl radicals ho generated by the aforementioned reactions decomposed the organic dyes eq 6 the apparent first order decomposition rate kapp values were calculated by fitting eq 7 to the initial linear regression part and presented in table 2 the kapp of mb decreased in the order of us h2o2 mc us mc h2o2 mc and mc and that of mo decreased in the order of us h2o2 mc h2o2 mc us mc and mc to evaluate the synergistic effects of the mc us and h2o2 on the dye removal in the heterogeneous sono fenton like process the synergy factors were calculated using the single mc dual us mc and h2o2 mc and triple us h2o2 mc apparent decomposition rates as follows eq 8 7 l n c c 0 k a p p t 8 s y n e r g y f a c t o r k t r i p l e k s i n g l e k d u a l the calculated synergy factors were 5 73 for mb and 10 95 for mo indicating that the us h2o2 mc system had significant synergistic effects on the dye removal for a reaction time of 60 min the mb removal efficiency was 49 with an initial dye concentration of 300 mg l and decreased to 24 with an initial concentration of 1000 mg l in the case of 50 mg l mb the dye had completely disappeared after the same reaction time fig 3 a for mo the removal efficiencies with a reaction time of 60 min were 69 29 and 14 for initial dye concentrations of 50 300 and 1000 mg l respectively fig 3 b this is because large amounts of dye molecules quickly occupied the active sites of the catalyst restricting the generation of reactive radicals in the sonocatalysis process interestingly over the next 60 min the removal efficiency for the dyes increased more significantly than that in the first 60 min which was not observed at low initial concentrations such as 50 mg l during the second 60 min period 50 and 57 of 300 and 1000 mg l mb were removed respectively which were 1 02 and 2 38 times higher respectively than the efficiencies in the first 60 min enhanced removal efficiencies in the second 60 min were also observed for mo 2 24 times 65 for 300 mg l and 2 79 times 39 for 1000 mg l these results agree with previous studies on the two stage decomposition of contaminants the two stages correspond to the induction period and the rapid degradation period 24 50 the following two reaction mechanisms are proposed first the reduction reactions of eqs 4 and 5 occurred during the slow reaction in the first stage and were reflected in the rapid decomposition in the second stage second the effect of degradation intermediates which competed with the parent compound for the consumption of reactive radicals resulted in a slow reaction in the first stage the degradation of dyes over time in the triple us h2o2 mc systems was also compared with identical mass of maghemite nanoparticles instead of mc under the same experimental conditions fig s6 the maghemite nanoparticles were prepared from the same synthetic procedure of mc except for food waste additions the removal efficiency of the dyes gradually increased over time and reached 36 for mb and 53 for mo in 180 min this contrasts with when mc was used as a catalyst mb was completely removed within 60 min and 95 of mo was removed for 180 min the lower degradation efficiency of maghemite nanoparticles might be attributed to the catalyst aggregation and the supporting the maghemite nanoparticles on the mc prevents aggregation and enhances the accessibility of the reactants to the active site 16 51 in addition the adsorption of the dyes on the maghemite is negligible so it is difficult to expect to concentrate contaminants near active sites named trap and zap strategy 52 3 3 effects of the operating parameters on dye removal 3 3 1 effects of h2o2 concentration the production of reactive radicals in heterogeneous fenton like systems is directly affected by the concentration of h2o2 24 49 in this study the effect of the initial h2o2 concentration on the dye removal efficiency was evaluated fig 4 a as the concentration of h2o2 increased from 4 to 40 mm the removal efficiency for mb gradually increased from 31 to 98 owing to the increased production of reactive radicals 16 53 the removal efficiency for mb reached 100 at an h2o2 concentration of 100 mm and remained at 100 until the h2o2 concentration reached 200 mm similarly the mo removal efficiency increased from 26 to 97 as the h2o2 concentration increased from 4 to 40 mm it was maintained at 98 and 99 at h2o2 concentrations of 100 and 200 mm respectively 3 3 2 effects of mc dosage to evaluate the effect of the catalyst dosage on the removal efficiency for the dyes a series of experiments were performed involving a 180 min sonocatalytic process with 200 mm h2o2 in the catalyst dosage range of 0 1 10 g l as shown in fig 4 b the decolorization efficiency for mb in the us h2o2 mc process increased from 65 to 96 as the mc dosage increased from 0 1 to 0 5 g l this was due to the increased amount of catalytically activated sites with the increased mc dosage 30 54 which accelerated the generation of reactive radicals the removal efficiency for mb was maintained at 100 while the dosage of mc was increased to 10 g l the discoloration efficiency for mo increased from 21 to 95 as the dosage of mc increased from 0 1 to 0 5 g l 3 3 3 effect of ultrasonic power the ultrasonic power also significantly affect the dye removal efficiency the compression and expansion of ultrasonic waves generate microbubbles in the liquid medium leading to collapse and acoustic cavitation the energy generated by microbubbles bursting can enhance the generation of reactive species as well as some mechanical and physical effects 46 to examine the effect of the ultrasonic power on the dye removal powers ranging from 0 100 were employed to degrade 300 mg l dyes for 3 h with 2 g l mc and 200 mm h2o2 fig 4 c at 30 ultrasonic power 10 6 w l the removal efficiencies for mb and mo were 56 and 51 respectively which were significantly higher than those under the silent condition 10 for mb and 12 for mo the dye removal efficiencies increased with the output power reaching 99 and 96 for mb and mo respectively at 80 ultrasonic power 28 2 w l this is because larger amounts of microbubbles were generated as the power increased the turbulence generated by the acoustic cavitation can increase the mixing intensity accelerating the mass transfer of the dyes and can remove byproducts from the active sites on the catalyst surface thereby facilitating the generation of reactive radicals 46 49 there was no significant difference in the removal efficiency between the ultrasonic powers of 80 28 2 w l and 100 35 3 w l deterioration in removal efficiency due to excess hydrogen peroxide concentration catalyst dose and ultrasonic irradiation power was not observed under given experimental conditions 3 3 4 effects of solution ph the ph of the solution is generally considered to be an important parameter in fenton like processes 24 the effect of the solution ph on the dye removal was examined in the ph range of 3 11 the removal efficiencies did not vary significantly with respect to the ph p 0 05 under the experimental conditions fig 4 d the removal efficiencies for mo decreased slightly from 100 to 95 as solution ph increased from 3 to 11 while mb was completely removed under all solution ph conditions on the other hand these differences are more apparent under attenuated conditions dye 0 300 mg l mc 0 5 g l h2o2 40 mm us 28 2 w l reaction time 3 h fig s7 under the given conditions the removal efficiencies for mb decreased slightly from 100 to 96 as solution ph increased from 3 to 9 and drastically decreased to 41 at solution ph 11 the removal efficiencies for mo decreased gradually from 100 to 14 as solution ph increased from 3 to 11 under the same conditions the reasons for the efficiency decrease as the ph increases in fenton like processes are as follows the solubility of iron decreases eq 3 the self decomposition of h2o2 to o2 and h2o increases and the oxidation potential of ho radicals decreases 49 50 in addition carbonate and bicarbonate are converted to carbonic acid at low solution ph resulting in low reaction with ho radicals eq 12 55 3 3 5 assessment of the significance of operating parameters using ann modeling in order to find an optimal network the number of neurons in the hidden layer was set within the range of 6 12 for performing training the mse had the lowest value 4 552 when the number of neurons in the hidden layer was 10 fig s8 thus the optimal ann consists of an input layer with 4 neurons a hidden layer with 10 neurons and an output layer with 1 neuron which can be expressed as a 4 10 1 ann model the experimental data sets were divided randomly into training set 60 validation set 20 and test set 20 the correlation of the output of the model to its input is expressed as follows 9 o u t p u t p u r e l i n l w t a n s i g i w x b 1 b 2 where x is inputs i w and b 1 are the weight and bias respectively of the hidden layer and l w and b 2 are the weight and bias respectively of the output layer the weight and bias values obtained for the optimally trained ann are listed in table s2 sensitivity analysis was performed in order to assess the relative importance of each operating parameter affecting the results specifically the relative significance was determined by calculating the connection weights according to the following equation 56 10 i j m 1 m n h w j m i h k 1 n i w k m i h w m n h o k 1 k n i m 1 m n h w j m i h k 1 n i w k m i h w m n h o 100 where ni and nh are the numbers of neurons at input and hidden layer the superscripts of weight i h and o refer to input hidden and output layers while k m and n refer to the neuron s number of input hidden and output layers the relative significance of each input parameter in the 4 10 1 ann model was shown in table s3 these results revealed that initial h2o2 concentration 37 6 and mc dose 30 9 were the most significant parameters for the degradation of organic dyes in the triple us h2o2 mc system followed by less significance in the order of ultrasonic power 19 1 and solution ph 12 4 3 4 effects of scavengers and inorganic salts on dye removal to identify the role of active radical species in the heterogeneous sono fenton like process the effects of etoh ho scavenger on the dye degradation were investigated as shown in fig s9 a the degradation of mb was affected by quenching chemical the removal efficiency for mb over 120 min was reduced to 72 by 2000 mm etoh while completely removed under other conditions in contrast the removal efficiency for mo over 120 min were reduced to 94 75 and 48 as etoh concentration increased to 10 50 2000 mm fig s9 c this indicates that ho radical was involved in the mb and mo degradation 31 57 to ensure the formation of ho radicals during the us h2o2 mc processes photoluminescence pl analyses were conducted as shown in fig s10 the formation of ho radicals were enhanced by increasing the ultrasonic irradiation time chlorides carbonates and sulfates are abundant anions in wastewater and natural water and they can negatively affect the sonocatalytic decomposition performance as ho radical scavengers eqs 11 13 58 59 thus the effects of nacl na2co3 and na2so4 on the decomposition of the organic dyes were investigated figs s9 b and d the effects of the anions on the removal of mb decreased in the order of chloride sulfate and carbonate which agrees with previous reports indicating that chloride is generally a stronger scavenger than sulfate and carbonate 59 in contrast the effects of the anions on the removal of mo decreased in the following order sulfate carbonate and chloride 11 c l h o c l h o 12 c o 3 2 h o c o 3 h o 13 s o 4 2 h o s o 4 h o 3 5 reusability of mc one of the important factors in practical applications is the reusability of the catalyst 49 58 thus the mc was reused for five repeated us h2o2 mc processes after each process the catalyst was separated from the treated solution using a magnet fig 1 c and then dried before it was reused in the next run as shown in fig 5 a over the five reuse cycles the removal efficiency for mb decreased from 100 to 84 and that for mo rapidly decreased from 93 to 10 these results are explained as follows large amounts of the unstable iron in the mc which caused the fenton reaction were eliminated in the initial mb removal experiment whereas stable iron remained during the reuse experiments thus the removal efficiency was not significantly reduced 16 30 this is because the dissociation of iron by the propagated ultrasonic energy is prevented by occupying the active site on mc due to adsorption of mb 1 in contrast in the case of mo removal continuous iron dissociated not only in the initial experiment but also in the subsequent experiments significantly reducing the removal performance fig 5 b xps was performed to examine the changes in the chemical structure and state of the mc after mb and mo removal via the us h2o2 mc processes the deconvoluted spectra of the mc and the mc after mb mo removal are presented in fig 6 the three peaks in the c1s spectrum which correspond to graphitic carbon carbon in carboxyl groups and carbon in carboxyl and or ester groups at 284 6 286 4 and 288 2 ev respectively were observed even after the dye removal 60 61 the three o1s peaks at 529 6 531 and 532 5 ev correspond to fe2o3 co and oh respectively in agreement with xps results for other types of biochar 61 63 the c1s and o1s xps results indicate that the us h2o2 mc process did not affect the chemical structure of the mc and that the mc was not poisoned by dyes during the us h2o2 mc process additionally the peak in the fe2p spectrum corresponding to maghemite was not shifted after the dye removal 64 3 6 comparison of triple us h2o2 mc system for organic dyes removal with literature the removal efficiency and kinetic decomposition constant of dyes by triple us h2o2 mc system were compared with various heterogeneous sono fenton processes in terms of catalyst type and dose ultrasonic power and h2o2 concentration as well as target dye concentration solution ph and reaction time 8 33 49 58 65 71 as shown in table 3 the us assisted heterogeneous fenton triple process exhibits superior decolorization for various organic dyes in aqueous solutions and our results corroborate recent studies particularly convenient separation from wastewater by a magnetic field has been made possible by magnetic catalysts which can lead a benign and pure process for wastewater treatment 3 7 application of triple us h2o2 mc system for textile wastewater treatment the applicability of us h2o2 mc process to treat the real textile wastewater was also investigated the characteristics of the green blue color textile wastewater used in this study were presented in table 4 the experiments were conducted with different mc dose 2 g l and 10 g l and the degradation of textile wastewater was quantified with changes in color λmax 600 nm and toc fig 7 the removal efficiency of the green blue color was 35 in 15 min and reached 60 in 180 min under 2 g l catalyst dose with 200 mm h2o2 and 35 3 w l ultrasonic power the removal efficiency increased rapidly as the mc dose increased to 10 g l and reached 68 in 15 min as described above this is because the amount of catalytically activated sites increased as mc dose increased 30 54 which suggested the removal efficiency of the textile wastewater could be enhanced via catalyst does control compared to decolorization the removal efficiency of toc is generally small because the intermediate products and stable organic compounds of colored wastewater during oxidation are measured as toc 33 72 meanwhile the toc increased as the reaction time increased because the toc can be eluted from the biochar 73 nonetheless the toc can also be controlled by increasing the mc dose 4 conclusions we synthesized mc using food waste and used it to remove organic dye from water i e as a catalyst in the heterogenous fenton like process the mc containing maghemite was successfully prepared via a pre pyrolysis process and had sufficient magnetization to be separated from the water using a conventional magnet after treatment the us assisted heterogenous fenton like triple us h2o2 mc system exhibited synergistic effects compared with single and dual systems and effectively removed organic dyes from water the removal efficiency for the dyes increased with the h2o2 concentration catalyst dose and ultrasonic power the removal behavior differed for cationic and anionic dyes with the us h2o2 mc system and was affected by the amount of iron immobilized on the biochar this study provides useful insights into the environmental application of modified biochar derived from food waste declaration of competing interest there are no conflicts of interest to declare acknowledgement this work

organic dyes from water and the synergistic effects of ultrasound us were evaluated the heterogeneous sono fenton like triple us h2o2 catalyst system exhibited a high dye removal efficiency the calculated synergy factors were 5 73 for methylene blue mb and 10 95 for methyl orange mo the dye removal efficiency increased with the h2o2 concentration catalyst dose and ultrasonic power when the catalyst was reused five times the removal efficiency for mb was maintained above 84 whereas that for mo was reduced to 10 the removal efficiency was also evaluated in real textile wastewater keywords magnetic biochar food waste ultrasound heterogenous fenton textile wastewater 1 introduction dye is one of the worst organic pollutants derived from paper textile cosmetic and food industry effluents 1 the release of dyes alters the clarity of water even in trace amounts which interferes with light diffusion and affects the photosynthesis of aquatic plants and poses a great threat to aquatic life and human beings due to their toxicity mutagenic and carcinogenic and poor biodegradability 2 3 various physicochemical techniques such as adsorption membrane filtration precipitation and coagulation have been used for the decolorization process 4 6 however these approaches only collect or transfer the dye molecules from aqueous phase to another thus cannot completely remove pollutants 2 therefore many studies have recently been conducted using advanced oxidation processes aops to destroy organic pollutants such as dyes in various wastewaters including uv h2o2 3 uv tio2 7 and heterogeneous sono fenton processes 8 biochar which is derived from various types of waste such as sewage sludge 9 corncobs 10 litchi peels 11 manure 12 and food waste 13 is an excellent adsorbent for wastewater treatment in addition to its adsorption capacity recent research revealed that biochar is a promising heterogeneous catalyst for wastewater treatment fang et al 14 reported that biochar activates persulfate producing sulfate radicals and efficiently breaking down polychlorinated biphenyls wang and wang 15 found that sludge derived biochar can activate peroxymonosulfate producing sulfate radicals for the degradation of triclosan in wastewater nevertheless to satisfy the requirements of wastewater treatment it is necessary to improve the catalytic performance of biochar through various activation techniques and modification with iron oxide can be an effective and widely adoptable solution 16 17 generally iron impregnation is performed by immersing biochar post pyrolysis or its feedstock pre pyrolysis in a nitrate or chloride salt solution followed by heating to a temperature of 50 300 c to release nitrates or chlorides as no2 and cl2 gases and convert iron ions into iron oxides 18 the produced biochar can be used as a catalyst in the heterogeneous fenton like oxidation process for dyeing wastewater treatment and can be easily recovered through magnetic separation after being used as a magnetic biochar mc in water treatment 17 19 since the formation of hydroxyl radicals using ultrasound in aqueous solutions was first reported 20 we have witnessed the proliferation of ultrasound us applications for removing organic contaminants from water because of its ability to produce hydroxyl radicals sonolysis us which is considered an advanced oxidation process aop has inherent advantages over other aops e g no chemical reagent is needed and the materials are easy to handle 21 22 however sonolysis generally has a low level of mineralization 10 as the resulting product is hydrophilic and nonvolatile which limits its complete removal and ultrasonic waves incur a relatively high cost owing to the high electrical energy consumption 21 these drawbacks can be overcome by combining sonolysis with other aops such as sono photocatalysis 23 sono fenton reactions 24 and sono electrochemistry 25 such combinations enhance the production of reactive radicals leading to synergistic effects and accelerating the degradation of contaminants few studies have been performed on the use of biochar as a catalyst in the heterogeneous sono fenton like process to remove organic pollutants 26 and the derivation of mc from food waste has not been reported therefore in this study food waste derived mc was prepared via a pre pyrolysis method and characterized including its magnetic properties the synergistic effects of the biochar catalyst us and h2o2 on the removal of organic dyes from aqueous solutions in a heterogeneous sono fenton like process were evaluated the effects of the initial h2o2 concentration catalyst dose ultrasonic power initial dye concentration and solution ph were examined additionally the effects of different scavengers on the dye removal and the reusability of the catalyst were investigated 2 material and methods 2 1 materials food waste was obtained from a food waste disposal facility in seoul korea

than 0 15 mm 100 sieve washed with di water to remove impurities and then dried in a vacuum oven ftvo 701 sci finetech korea at 70 c prior to use 2 3 experimental procedure all experiments involving us were performed with 10 ml of mb and mo solutions in 12 ml glass tubes glass tubes containing individual samples were sealed with parafilm m parafilm bemis usa a basic bath type ultrasonic generator elmasonic p 30 h elma germany equipped with a single transducer was used at a frequency of 37 khz the intensity of the ultrasonic power transmitted to the bath was adjusted to power per volume w l

amounts were changed in the operating parameter tests the temperature of the ultrasonic bath was not adjusted and ranged from 18 to 62 c depending on the ultrasonic power and irradiation time in the experiments without us a shaking incubator sj 808sf sejong science co korea was used at 120 rpm and the experiments were performed at 25 c all the samples were filtered 25hp020an advantec japan and subjected to measurements each filtered sample was diluted with di water for measurement the diluted sample concentration was measured using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer neo s2117 neogen korea the

oxygen demand cod and hardness were also evaluated according to standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 29 2 5 artificial neural network ann modeling a three layer feed forward multilayer perceptron artificial neural network ann was applied to simulate the results the initial h2o2 concentration catalyst dose ultrasonic power and solution ph were chosen as the neurons of input layer to optimize the structure of ann the number of neurons in hidden layer were varied from 6 to 12 output layer was consisted with the one neuron removal efficiency input values were rescaled min max normalized as follows eq 1 1 x i x i m i n x max x m i n x where xi is the rescaled i th value in variable x xi is the original i th value in variable x min x is the minimum value of variable

optimization of ann with above structure was performed with matlab 2019b mathworks usa by the mean square error mse minimization from validation set 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of mc the morphology and chemical composition of the surface of the mc were measured via field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds fig s2 the iron precipitate covered the biochar surface in an aggregated manner as transition metals such as iron tend to aggregate on the surface of composites 30 31 successful iron loading on the biochar derived from food waste was confirmed by the high intensity fe peaks 48 80 0 29 wt for the prepared sample which also contained significant amounts of c 35 93 0 33 wt and o 14 56 0 17 wt the crystalline structure of the prepared sample was investigated via x ray diffraction xrd analysis fig 1 a the strong and sharp peaks indicated that the iron oxide produced in the biochar matrix was highly crystallized the diffraction peaks at approximately 2θ 30 34 35 76 43 46 53 94 57 54 and 63 08 correspond to the 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 planes respectively of the cubic structure of maghemite jcpds no 39 1364 32 this magnetic iron oxide contained in magnetic biochar could be used as a heterogeneous catalyst for the sono fenton process to treat textile wastewaters 8 33 and the band gap of mc estimated by the tauc plot αhν 2 k hν eg was 2 1 ev fig s3 which is due to the influence of formed iron oxide on the biochar surface 34 35 the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms and pore size distribution curve of the mc are presented in fig s4 the prepared sample exhibited a mesoporous structure and the specific surface area and pore volume were analyzed as shown in table s1 the specific surface area was determined to be 68 555 m2 g via the brunauer emmett teller bet method the pore size distribution calculated from the desorption branch via the barrett joyner halenda bjh method exhibited a bimodal distribution with a narrow distribution centered at 4 nm and a wide distribution centered at 10 nm these bimodal distributions are attributed to the interspaces between the biochar and aggregated maghemite particles the surface functional groups of the mc were investigated via ftir spectroscopy fig s5 the broad peak at approximately 3200 cm 1in the spectrum corresponds to the oh stretching vibration of alcohols phenols and carboxylic acid groups 36 the peak at 1594 cm 1 corresponds to the cc stretching of the aromatic ring and the peak at 1374 cm 1 is related to aliphatic ch 37 38 the band at 540 cm 1 is attributed to the feo vibration 16 39 the magnetic properties of the sample were measured using a vsm fig 1 b the mc had a magnetic saturation of approximately 43 8 emu g which was sufficient 16 3 emu g for it to be manipulated using an external magnetic field e g a conventional magnet fig 1 c 40 3 2 comparison of different processes for dye removal the degradation of organic dyes over time was compared in different processes involving single us h2o2 mc dual us h2o2 us mc h2o2 mc and triple us h2o2 mc systems as shown in fig 2 the single processes of sonolysis us and h2o2 oxidation were not effective for removing either dye from the solution only 10 mb mb 0 50 mg l was removed by us after 180 min while the h2o2 oxidation was negligible in contrast 70 mb was removed after 180 min via a single adsorption mc process this is because the mb was easily adsorbed on the heterogeneous surfaces of the mc 31 41 the adsorption of mo which is an anionic dye on biochar is generally weaker than that of mb which is a cationic dye 10 42 accordingly only 22 of mo mo 0 50 mg l was removed by the adsorption process for the same reaction time fig 2 the degradation of the dyes with the us h2o2 system was nearly identical to that with the us system 11 for mb and 10 for mo indicating that the us was ineffective for promoting the decomposition of h2o2 into reactive radicals under the experimental conditions the removal of the dyes with the h2o2 mc system 68 for mb and 29 for mo was similar to that with the single mc system p 0 05 the combination of us with the mc us mc system enhanced the dye removal 93 for mb and 31 for mo this enhanced adsorption can be attributed to the mass transfer from the liquid phase to the solid pores and the creation of new adsorption sites on the surface resulting from the sonication 43 44 furthermore the presence of mc could provide additional active sites for nucleation of bubbles 1 45 interestingly the us assisted h2o2 mc system us h2o2 mc exhibited synergistic effects on the dye removal with this triple system 90 of the mb was removed after 30 min and 100 was removed after 60 min additionally 95 of the mo was removed after 180 min these results are attributed to the synergistic effects of the us and mc on the decomposition of h2o2 into ho the reactions for the us h2o2 mc system are postulated as follows 2 h 2 o 2 u s 2 h o 3 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 h o h o 4 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 h o 2 h 5 f e 3 h o 2 f e 2 o 2 h 6 o r g a n i c d y e s h o d e g r a d e d p r o d u c t s first h2o2 molecules were decomposed by us irradiation in the presence of mc as a catalyst producing ho eq 2 46 47 simultaneously the fenton catalytic reaction between the mc and h2o2 was facilitated by the us treatment eq 3 48 additionally the oxidized ferric iron was reduced to ferrous iron by the reaction with h2o2 and hydrogen peroxide radicals ho2 eqs 4 and 5 24 49 the ferrous iron could be reused in subsequent fenton reactions finally the hydroxyl radicals ho generated by the aforementioned reactions decomposed the organic dyes eq 6 the apparent first order decomposition rate kapp values were calculated by fitting eq 7 to the initial linear regression part and presented in table 2 the kapp of mb decreased in the order of us h2o2 mc us mc h2o2 mc and mc and that of mo decreased in the order of us h2o2 mc h2o2 mc us mc and mc to evaluate the synergistic effects of the mc us and h2o2 on the dye removal in the heterogeneous sono fenton like process the synergy factors were calculated using the single mc dual us mc and h2o2 mc and triple us h2o2 mc apparent decomposition rates as follows eq 8 7 l n c c 0 k a p p t 8 s y n e r g y f a c t o r k t r i p l e k s i n g l e k d u a l the calculated synergy factors were 5 73 for mb and 10 95 for mo indicating that the us h2o2 mc system had significant synergistic effects on the dye removal for a reaction time of 60 min the mb removal efficiency was 49 with an initial dye concentration of 300 mg l and decreased to 24 with an initial concentration of 1000 mg l in the case of 50 mg l mb the dye had completely disappeared after the same reaction time fig 3 a for mo the removal efficiencies with a reaction time of 60 min were 69 29 and 14 for initial dye concentrations of 50 300 and 1000 mg l respectively fig 3 b this is because large amounts of dye molecules quickly occupied the active sites of the catalyst restricting the generation of reactive radicals in the sonocatalysis process interestingly over the next 60 min the removal efficiency for the dyes increased more significantly than that in the first 60 min which was not observed at low initial concentrations such as 50 mg l during the second 60 min period 50 and 57 of 300 and 1000 mg l mb were removed respectively which were 1 02 and 2 38 times higher respectively than the efficiencies in the first 60 min enhanced removal efficiencies in the second 60 min were also observed for mo 2 24 times 65 for 300 mg l and 2 79 times 39 for 1000 mg l these results agree with previous studies on the two stage decomposition of contaminants the two stages correspond to the induction period and the rapid degradation period 24 50 the following two reaction mechanisms are proposed first the reduction reactions of eqs 4 and 5 occurred during the slow reaction in the first stage and were reflected in the rapid decomposition in the second stage second the effect of degradation intermediates which competed with the parent compound for the consumption of reactive radicals resulted in a slow reaction in the first stage the degradation of dyes over time in the triple us h2o2 mc systems was also compared with identical mass of maghemite nanoparticles instead of mc under the same experimental conditions fig s6 the maghemite nanoparticles were prepared from the same synthetic procedure of mc except for food waste additions the removal efficiency of the dyes gradually increased over time and reached 36 for mb and 53 for mo in 180 min this contrasts with when mc was used as a catalyst mb was completely removed within 60 min and 95 of mo was removed for 180 min the lower degradation efficiency of maghemite nanoparticles might be attributed to the catalyst aggregation and the supporting the maghemite nanoparticles on the mc prevents aggregation and enhances the accessibility of the reactants to the active site 16 51 in addition the adsorption of the dyes on the maghemite is negligible so it is difficult to expect to concentrate contaminants near active sites named trap and zap strategy 52 3 3 effects of the operating parameters on dye removal 3 3 1 effects of h2o2 concentration the production of reactive radicals in heterogeneous fenton like systems is directly affected by the concentration of h2o2 24 49 in this study the effect of the initial h2o2 concentration on the dye removal efficiency was evaluated fig 4 a as the concentration of h2o2 increased from 4 to 40 mm the removal efficiency for mb gradually increased from 31 to 98 owing to the increased production of reactive radicals 16 53 the removal efficiency for mb reached 100 at an h2o2 concentration of 100 mm and remained at 100 until the h2o2 concentration reached 200 mm similarly the mo removal efficiency increased from 26 to 97 as the h2o2 concentration increased from 4 to 40 mm it was maintained at 98 and 99 at h2o2 concentrations of 100 and 200 mm respectively 3 3 2 effects of mc dosage to evaluate the effect of the catalyst dosage on the removal efficiency for the dyes a series of experiments were performed involving a 180 min sonocatalytic process with 200 mm h2o2 in the catalyst dosage range of 0 1 10 g l as shown in fig 4 b the decolorization efficiency for mb in the us h2o2 mc process increased from 65 to 96 as the mc dosage increased from 0 1 to 0 5 g l this was due to the increased amount of catalytically activated sites with the increased mc dosage 30 54 which accelerated the generation of reactive radicals the removal efficiency for mb was maintained at 100 while the dosage of mc was increased to 10 g l the discoloration efficiency for mo increased from 21 to 95 as the dosage of mc increased from 0 1 to 0 5 g l 3 3 3 effect of ultrasonic power the ultrasonic power also significantly affect the dye removal efficiency the compression and expansion of ultrasonic waves generate microbubbles in the liquid medium leading to collapse and acoustic cavitation the energy generated by microbubbles bursting can enhance the generation of reactive species as well as some mechanical and physical effects 46 to examine the effect of the ultrasonic power on the dye removal powers ranging from 0 100 were employed to degrade 300 mg l dyes for 3 h with 2 g l mc and 200 mm h2o2 fig 4 c at 30 ultrasonic power 10 6 w l the removal efficiencies for mb and mo were 56 and 51 respectively which were significantly higher than those under the silent condition 10 for mb and 12 for mo the dye removal efficiencies increased with the output power reaching 99 and 96 for mb and mo respectively at 80 ultrasonic power 28 2 w l this is because larger amounts of microbubbles were generated as the power increased the turbulence generated by the acoustic cavitation can increase the mixing intensity accelerating the mass transfer of the dyes and can remove byproducts from the active sites on the catalyst surface thereby facilitating the generation of reactive radicals 46 49 there was no significant difference in the removal efficiency between the ultrasonic powers of 80 28 2 w l and 100 35 3 w l deterioration in removal efficiency due to excess hydrogen peroxide concentration catalyst dose and ultrasonic irradiation power was not observed under given experimental conditions 3 3 4 effects of solution ph the ph of the solution is generally considered to be an important parameter in fenton like processes 24 the effect of the solution ph on the dye removal was examined in the ph range of 3 11 the removal efficiencies did not vary significantly with respect to the ph p 0 05 under the experimental conditions fig 4 d the removal efficiencies for mo decreased slightly from 100 to 95 as solution ph increased from 3 to 11 while mb was completely removed under all solution ph conditions on the other hand these differences are more apparent under attenuated conditions dye 0 300 mg l mc 0 5 g l h2o2 40 mm us 28 2 w l reaction time 3 h fig s7 under the given conditions the removal efficiencies for mb decreased slightly from 100 to 96 as solution ph increased from 3 to 9 and drastically decreased to 41 at solution ph 11 the removal efficiencies for mo decreased gradually from 100 to 14 as solution ph increased from 3 to 11 under the same conditions the reasons for the efficiency decrease as the ph increases in fenton like processes are as follows the solubility of iron decreases eq 3 the self decomposition of h2o2 to o2 and h2o increases and the oxidation potential of ho radicals decreases 49 50 in addition carbonate and bicarbonate are converted to carbonic acid at low solution ph resulting in low reaction with ho radicals eq 12 55 3 3 5 assessment of the significance of operating parameters using ann modeling in order to find an optimal network the number of neurons in the hidden layer was set within the range of 6 12 for performing training the mse had the lowest value 4 552 when the number of neurons in the hidden layer was 10 fig s8 thus the optimal ann consists of an input layer with 4 neurons a hidden layer with 10 neurons and an output layer with 1 neuron which can be expressed as a 4 10 1 ann model the experimental data sets were divided randomly into training set 60 validation set 20 and test set 20 the correlation of the output of the model to its input is expressed as follows 9 o u t p u t p u r e l i n l w t a n s i g i w x b 1 b 2 where x is inputs i w and b 1 are the weight and bias respectively of the hidden layer and l w and b 2 are the weight and bias respectively of the output layer the weight and bias values obtained for the optimally trained ann are listed in table s2 sensitivity analysis was performed in order to assess the relative importance of each operating parameter affecting the results specifically the relative significance was determined by calculating the connection weights according to the following equation 56 10 i j m 1 m n h w j m i h k 1 n i w k m i h w m n h o k 1 k n i m 1 m n h w j m i h k 1 n i w k m i h w m n h o 100 where ni and nh are the numbers of neurons at input and hidden layer the superscripts of weight i h and o refer to input hidden and output layers while k m and n refer to the neuron s number of input hidden and output layers the relative significance of each input parameter in the 4 10 1 ann model was shown in table s3 these results revealed that initial h2o2 concentration 37 6 and mc dose 30 9 were the most significant parameters for the degradation of organic dyes in the triple us h2o2 mc system followed by less significance in the order of ultrasonic power 19 1 and solution ph 12 4 3 4 effects of scavengers and inorganic salts on dye removal to identify the role of active radical species in the heterogeneous sono fenton like process the effects of etoh ho scavenger on the dye degradation were investigated as shown in fig s9 a the degradation of mb was affected by quenching chemical the removal efficiency for mb over 120 min was reduced to 72 by 2000 mm etoh while completely removed under other conditions in contrast the removal efficiency for mo over 120 min were reduced to 94 75 and 48 as etoh concentration increased to 10 50 2000 mm fig s9 c this indicates that ho radical was involved in the mb and mo degradation 31 57 to ensure the formation of ho radicals during the us h2o2 mc processes photoluminescence pl analyses were conducted as shown in fig s10 the formation of ho radicals were enhanced by increasing the ultrasonic irradiation time chlorides carbonates and sulfates are abundant anions in wastewater and natural water and they can negatively affect the sonocatalytic decomposition performance as ho radical scavengers eqs 11 13 58 59 thus the effects of nacl na2co3 and na2so4 on the decomposition of the organic dyes were investigated figs s9 b and d the effects of the anions on the removal of mb decreased in the order of chloride sulfate and carbonate which agrees with previous reports indicating that chloride is generally a stronger scavenger than sulfate and carbonate 59 in contrast the effects of the anions on the removal of mo decreased in the following order sulfate carbonate and chloride 11 c l h o c l h o 12 c o 3 2 h o c o 3 h o 13 s o 4 2 h o s o 4 h o 3 5 reusability of mc one of the important factors in practical applications is the reusability of the catalyst 49 58 thus the mc was reused for five repeated us h2o2 mc processes after each process the catalyst was separated from the treated solution using a magnet fig 1 c and then dried before it was reused in the next run as shown in fig 5 a over the five reuse cycles the removal efficiency for mb decreased from 100 to 84 and that for mo rapidly decreased from 93 to 10 these results are explained as follows large amounts of the unstable iron in the mc which caused the fenton reaction were eliminated in the initial mb removal experiment whereas stable iron remained during the reuse experiments thus the removal efficiency was not significantly reduced 16 30 this is because the dissociation of iron by the propagated ultrasonic energy is prevented by occupying the active site on mc due to adsorption of mb 1 in contrast in the case of mo removal continuous iron dissociated not only in the initial experiment but also in the subsequent experiments significantly reducing the removal performance fig 5 b xps was performed to examine the changes in the chemical structure and state of the mc after mb and mo removal via the us h2o2 mc processes the deconvoluted spectra of the mc and the mc after mb mo removal are presented in fig 6 the three peaks in the c1s spectrum which correspond to graphitic carbon carbon in carboxyl groups and carbon in carboxyl and or ester groups at 284 6 286 4 and 288 2 ev respectively were observed even after the dye removal 60 61 the three o1s peaks at 529 6 531 and 532 5 ev correspond to fe2o3 co and oh respectively in agreement with xps results for other types of biochar 61 63 the c1s and o1s xps results indicate that the us h2o2 mc process did not affect the chemical structure of the mc and that the mc was not poisoned by dyes during the us h2o2 mc process additionally the peak in the fe2p spectrum corresponding to maghemite was not shifted after the dye removal 64 3 6 comparison of triple us h2o2 mc system for organic dyes removal with literature the removal efficiency and kinetic decomposition constant of dyes by triple us h2o2 mc system were compared with various heterogeneous sono fenton processes in terms of catalyst type and dose ultrasonic power and h2o2 concentration as well as target dye concentration solution ph and reaction time 8 33 49 58 65 71 as shown in table 3 the us assisted heterogeneous fenton triple process exhibits superior decolorization for various organic dyes in aqueous solutions and our results corroborate recent studies particularly convenient separation from wastewater by a magnetic field has been made possible by magnetic catalysts which can lead a benign and pure process for wastewater treatment 3 7 application of triple us h2o2 mc system for textile wastewater treatment the applicability of us h2o2 mc process to treat the real textile wastewater was also investigated the characteristics of the green blue color textile wastewater used in this study were presented in table 4 the experiments were conducted with different mc dose 2 g l and 10 g l and the degradation of textile wastewater was quantified with changes in color λmax 600 nm and toc fig 7 the removal efficiency of the green blue color was 35 in 15 min and reached 60 in 180 min under 2 g l catalyst dose with 200 mm h2o2 and 35 3 w l ultrasonic power the removal efficiency increased rapidly as the mc dose increased to 10 g l and reached 68 in 15 min as described above this is because the amount of catalytically activated sites increased as mc dose increased 30 54 which suggested the removal efficiency of the textile wastewater could be enhanced via catalyst does control compared to decolorization the removal efficiency of toc is generally small because the intermediate products and stable organic compounds of colored wastewater during oxidation are measured as toc 33 72 meanwhile the toc increased as the reaction time increased because the toc can be eluted from the biochar 73 nonetheless the toc can also be controlled by increasing the mc dose 4 conclusions we synthesized mc using food waste and used it to remove organic dye from water i e as a catalyst in the heterogenous fenton like process the mc containing maghemite was successfully prepared via a pre pyrolysis process and had sufficient magnetization to be separated from the water using a conventional magnet after treatment the us assisted heterogenous fenton like triple us h2o2 mc system exhibited synergistic effects compared with single and dual systems and effectively removed organic dyes from water the removal efficiency for the dyes increased with the h2o2 concentration catalyst dose and ultrasonic power the removal behavior differed for cationic and anionic dyes with the us h2o2 mc system and was affected by the amount of iron immobilized on the biochar this study provides useful insights into the environmental application of modified biochar derived from food waste declaration of competing interest there are no conflicts of interest to declare acknowledgement this work

btex for electrochemical decomposition using an experimental design based on face centered composite design coupled with response surface methodology the response surface plots verify the results of the statistical analysis since electric current is the most detrimental factor to benzene removal whereas feed flow rate and btex initial concentration are the two most significant factors affecting

correlation models optimization 1 introduction nowadays huge amounts of highly saline wastewaters that are characterized by a multitude of inorganic and organic contaminants including heavy metals e g zinc lead manganese iron barium dissolved organics including toxic hydrocarbons and other pollutants e g oil and grease bacteria and nutrients are typically disposed of in the environment thus posing environmental and ecological risks 1 2 typical examples are brine wastes that originate from the hydraulic fracturing operations in the oil and gas industries flowback and or produced water 3 landfill leachate 4 acid rock and mine drainage 5 chlor alkali plant waste 6 chemical manufacturing 7 8 food processing 9 etc due to shortage of water resources and safety and health concerns associated with traditional disposal techniques e g underground injection discharge to streams rivers and other surface water bodies discharge in standard sewage treatment plants evaporation ponds and land application 10 11 treatment and possible reuse of such wastewaters have become emerging needs the treatment of polluted saline wastewaters by biological processes e g activated sludge is not recommended due to the adverse effects of salts and toxic compounds on the bacteria communities and the existence of residual chemicals in the sewage sludge and the discharge water 12 conventional oxidation methods such as chlorination or ozonation could lead to the formation of toxic byproducts 13 while adsorption on activated carbon or other filter media e g zeolites biochar present several limitations in treatment cost and handling of saturated exhausted filter materials 14 15 pressure driven membrane processes e g nanofiltration reverse osmosis 16 17 and other modern membrane technologies e g membrane distillation forward osmosis have been also considered for both total dissolved solids salts hardness and dissolved organics removal from high saline wastewaters 18 19 however membrane fouling due to organic matter inorganic colloids and micro organisms biofouling is the main disadvantage of these technologies which necessitates feed pre treatment higher pressure requirements during operation and frequent chemical cleanings with obvious negative consequences furthermore pollutants are transferred from one stream to another rather than removed as chemical content is concentrated in the rejection stream 16 17 the convenient application of electrical current instead of chemicals prompted researchers to develop electrochemical wastewater treatment technologies for the prevention of pollution problems 20 24 electro fenton ef and anodic oxidation ao are major representatives of the electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops that have been proven very effective towards the degradation and mineralization of recalcitrant organics present in saline waters offering distinct advantages for large scale applications such as versatility energy efficiency amenability of automation the possibility to avoid addition of chemicals and safety because they operate at mild conditions 25 27 in a recent comprehensive review brillas and garcia segura 28 provide a benchmarking framework of novel ef and related processes based on the oxidation of phenol as model compound and highlight the engineering challenges that need to be successfully addressed toward novel technology commercialization among such challenges the satisfactory long term performance in a realistic operational environment critically determines the technology readiness level of these technologies 29 for example the electrochemical oxidation process applied to brine wastes characterized by a high chloride content resulted in improved performance for organic pollutants degradation due to the formation of reactive chlorine species during electrolysis thus designated as electrochlorination process ecl 22 30 31 in a recent work of the authors a hybrid eaop that couples ao and ecl was greatly effective for the degradation mineralization of phenol compounds in strongly saline waters with reduced specific energy consumption 31 encouraged by the good results of this work the present study was undertaken to investigate the hybrid ao ecl process for removing mono aromatic hydrocarbons benzene toluene ethyl benzene and xylenes referred to as btex from highly saline waters btex are common pollutants found in industrial effluents e g oilfield produced water effluents of industries that utilize petrochemicals for the production of paints adhesives inks and rubber municipal landfill sites as well as in groundwater due to accidental events such as oil spills and oil pipeline leakages 32 although btex compounds are reported to be harmful to the ecosystem and the human health 33 their treatment remains a challenge due to their refractory nature and their higher solubility in comparison to their poly aromatic counterparts polyaromatic hydrocarbons in a recent study by da costa et al 34 good performance in btex removal was achieved during the treatment of a real effluent from oil water separator of fuel station by ao using ti pt as anode the type of supporting electrolyte and solution conductivity played a crucial role in process performance and economics in another study gargouri et al 35 conducted ao of real produced water in an electrolytic batch cell using pbo2 supported on tantalum and boron doped diamond bdd anodes and found that the latter exhibit higher oxidation rates of hydrocarbon compounds with lower consumption of energy in the work of da silva et al 36 the chloride ions content in the produced water was found to be a significant parameter because it promoted the electrogeneration of chlorine species thus leading to improved process efficiency to gain a better understanding on the efficiency and applicability of a chlorine enhanced eaop to treat btex in high salinity waters experiments were conducted in a pilot electrochemical unit with btex concentrations that simulate those found in wastewaters produced in oilfield operations in an effort to assess the technology readiness level of the aforementioned electrochemical process and its potential commercialization a real water matrix of increased salinity and chloride content i e seawater was used under realistic operating conditions thus possible discrepancies and unrepresentative results associated with the use of synthetic solutions could be avoided 29 in the following the experimental work is described first operational parameter optimization and modeling using the response surface methodology rsm is performed next for evaluating the effect of key operating parameters 2 experimental work 2 1 materials analytical grade chemicals were used as received benzene was supplied by merck germany toluene and ethyl benzene by sigma aldrich germany and xylenes by fluka switzerland at minimum purity of 99 5 1 0 g l btex stock solution was prepared by weighing 1 g of each compound in 1 l methanol and then mixed thoroughly subsequently feed water solutions were prepared with the addition of appropriate amounts of btex standard in seawater collected from the arabian gulf as shown in table 1 the seawater used in the experiments is highly saline presents high conductivity high chloride content and a total dissolved solids tds concentration of approx 38 300 mg l while the presence of organics toc is rather modest 2 2 electrochemical pilot scale plant a laboratory scale electrochemical treatment system ets pilot

hmi 2 3 experimental procedure aqueous feed solutions spiked with 0 5 1 25 and 2 5 mg l of btex compounds were circulated at various rates 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 m3 hr through the undivided electrochemical cell the range of btex concentration was selected taking into consideration typical concentrations of btex in wastewaters from oilfield operations produced water 17 in order to attain a homogenize feed the solution was initially recirculated at a high flow rate of 0 4 m3 h until parameters such as conductivity orp and ph readings are stable in both inlet and outlet of the cell after which the power supply was turned on and the experiment began the concentration levels of benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes m p xylene o xylene in the saline water samples collected at certain time intervals i e 0 15 30 60 and 120 min were measured using the gc ms the total organic carbon toc concentrations were not measured due to the low btex and background organic concentrations 0 3 mg l tested in this work 2 4 analytical methods and measurements btex degradation was assessed using thermo scientific trace gc ultra equipped with mass spectrometer and triplus head space autosampler the fused silica gc capillary column used was 60 m long with 0 32 mm internal diameter and a film thickness of 1 8 μm restek rtx 502 2 the carrier gas was high purity helium gas set at a constant flow rate of 1 0 ml min the injector temperature was 225 c while ms transfer line and ion source were set at 280 c and 250 c respectively prior to injection 25 ml sample vial containing 1 ml aqueous sample was incubated for 5 min in head space agitator set at 90 c also the gc oven conditions were set such that initial temperature of 40 c was held for 2 min and then ramped at 5 c min to reach 165 c and finally at 30 c min until 250 c and held for 2 min 2 5 experimental design experimental design by response surface methodology rsm was employed to optimize the electrochemical oxidation efficiency of btex in highly saline waters three independent factors namely the electric current density j factor a the feed flow rate ffr factor b and btex concentration btex factor c were correlated with the desired responses maximizing benzene toluene ethyl benzene m p xylene o xylene percentage removal in comparison to previous work with phenol 31 feeding air to the carbon ptfe cathode was not considered in this study due to its negative effect on the overall process performance determination of percentage removal was made at a fixed time of treatment according to the following equation 1 r c i c t c i x 100 where r is percentage of each btex compound benzene toluene ethyl benzene m p xylene o xylene removed ci and ct are the initial and final concentrations of each compound at electrolysis time t the three independent variables varied over three levels between 1 and 1 at determined ranges chosen based on previous research 31 and literature survey table 2 to determine the effect of the three variables on btex removal the most widely used approach of rsm was employed i e central composite design ccd and speciﬁcally a face centered composite fcc design to obtain optimum values of independent variables this approach resulted in 17 experiments table 3 it is noted that 10 additional experiments were performed at intermediate values allowing elucidation of the effect of process variables on btex treatment performance experimental data were fitted to the optimum mathematical model for each btex compound which was subsequently confirmed using graphs and analysis of variance anova the accuracy and applicability of the proposed models from rsm were evaluated by the statistical f value and the coefficient of determination r2 for the parameters studied the significance of all model coefficients was judged based on the probability value p 0 05 with 95 confidence level three dimensional response surface plots were drawn for the visualization of the interaction effects of the independent operational parameters on btex compounds removal finally an optimization was performed on the basis of the desirability function to determine the optimal conditions for btex removal numerical optimization was used to identify the specific point that maximizes the desirability function the experimental design statistical analysis response surface plots and optimization were performed using design expert v 11 1 2 0 software program stat ease inc minneapolis mn usa 3 results discussion 3 1 preliminary experiments considering the rather low range of btex concentrations applied and the moderate volatility of the respective compounds table s1 supplementary information a series of preliminary experiments were carried out in the absence of electric current aiming to assess the loss of each compound during the recirculation of feed solution in the pilot unit the results of a total nine experiments performed in duplicates are shown in fig s1 supplementary information where the loss of each of the five btex compounds after 120 min of seawater recirculation has been calculated for three different btex and ffr values according to fig s1 supplementary information the loss of btex compounds at 0 2 m3 h ffr followed the order ethyl benzene m p xylene o xylene toluene benzene a decline in the loss of all compounds was observed with the increased ffr with the exception of o xylene which exhibited a larger loss with increasing ffr in the case of btex the larger the initial concentration of all compounds in the mixture the lower was the loss during their recirculation in the pilot unit specifically at 2 5 mg l initial concentration of btex the loss of benzene varied from 9 8 25 4 of toluene from 0 to 16 9 of ethyl benzene from 0 to 23 1 of m p xylene from 0 to 13 4 and of o xylene from 0 to 17 1 for the aqueous system examined one way to explain the above results may be from the view point of btex adsorption on the carbon based cathode and the potential volatilization of the five compounds during the recirculation of the feed water both adsorption and volatilization can be affected by the variation of btex solubility in water i e larger solubility will tend to suppress the rate of adsorption and volatilization indeed the low water solubilities and the higher henry s constants in the case of ethyl benzene and xylenes table s1 supplementary information justify their increased tendency for hydrophobic interactions on the carbon surface and their volatilization however the higher feed water velocities seem to offset this tendency probably due to the better mixing and solubility of all compounds in the water matrix according to literature 37 the solubility of organic compounds decreases with increasing salinity salting out however the effect of brine on the suppression of btex volatilization is expected to be insignificant for the seawater employed in this work chao et al 38 report that a high concentration of nacl i e 35 000 mg l in water does not alter significantly the volatilization of btex it is noted that in real wastewaters as those mentioned in introduction btex compounds are dissolved together with other organic compounds e g phenols surfactants etc which can alter the solubility of btex in water and consequently the rate of their volatilization according to chao et al 38 the solubility of non ionic organic compounds like btex is enhanced due to their partitioning with the additional organic compounds and water this trend results in a suppression of the volatilization rates of btex which becomes even greater when other non polar organic compounds are dissolved 38 considering the aforementioned results the loss of btex due to volatilization is possible and needs to be taken into consideration when assessing the total removal of btex during the electrolysis ao ecl oxidation 3 2 effect of independent experimental variables on btex oxidation the results obtained from the experimental design matrix including the three independent variables j ffr btex are summarized in table 3 the responses btex are presented at electrolysis time 15 min and 30 min for which correlation models of great significance could be retrieved by the design expert programme at longer electrolysis times only mean constant models were obtained for almost all compounds this is due to the rather low btex initial concentrations and the fact that an effective oxidation of all compounds takes place during the first minutes of electrolysis this trend is clearly shown in fig 2 where the changes in btex concentration over the electrolysis time are depicted at constant current density j 100 ma cm2 and high feed flow rate ffr 0 4 m3 h among the five btex molecules xylenes exhibited the fastest removal rates being completely removed 100 within 30 min of electrolysis at the specified conditions more than 90 of toluene and ethyl benzene were removed within 90 min while 70 80 of benzene was removed within 120 min 3 2 1 effect of current density the effect of the three independent experimental variables on btex removal is shown in fig 3 as expected btex removal is drastically enhanced at higher current densities fig 3a this is more evident in the case of benzene toluene and o xylene for which an increase of three two and two orders of magnitude are observed respectively by doubling the current density in the cell these results are in accord with authors previous study with phenol 31 and the works reported in literature with btex and other petroleum hydrocarbons using different types of anodes i e ti pt ti iro2 ta2o5 and bdd anodes by da costa et al 34 and da silva et al 36 pbo2 supported on tantalum and bdd anodes by gargouri et al 35 and ti iro2 ta2o5 and ruo2 tio2 sno2 anode by ramalho et al 39 the increase in current density favours the in situ generation of strong oxidants either directly at the anode surface bdd oh by reaction 2 40 or indirectly in the bulk persulfate and active chlorine species by reactions 3 4 24 41 thus favoring the oxidation of btex compounds in shorter time 2 bdd h2o bdd oh h e 3 2so4 2 s2o8 2 2e 4 2cl cl2 g 2e however the removal rate after the first 15 30 min of electrolysis is not significantly affected by the current density since the percentage removal for each of the five compounds is similar regardless of the current density applied fig s2 supplementary information specifically the concentration decay of all compounds is linear during the first minutes of electrolysis following next an exponential mode that occurs at different rates for each compound this behavior is more pronounced at increased current densities and is attributed to the activation of competitive and parasitic reactions the latter involve primarily the oxidation of bdd oh to o2 at the anode by reaction 5 its dimerization to the less oxidant h2o2 by reaction 6 or the direct o2 evolution from water eq 7 24 40 5 bdd oh 2bdd o2 2h 2e 6 bdd oh 2bdd h2o2 7 2h2o o2 4h 4e 3 2 2 effect of feed flow rate the effect of feed flow rate on btex removal is shown in fig 3 b according to the preliminary experiments the increased flow rate favours the mixing of the five hydrocarbons and therefore their solubility in the feed solution this has reduced the loss of compounds due to volatilization loss less than 15 and has enhanced their mass transport both at the anode surface thus promoting their direct oxidation by bdd oh radicals and in the bulk thus enhancing their indirect oxidation due to reaction with the in situ generated oxidants cl2 s2o8 2 with the exception of benzene the increased recirculation flow rate of the seawater in the cell was followed by a reduced removal of the four mono aromatic hydrocarbons specifically at applied current density 100 ma cm2 and btex initial concentration 2 5 mg l the removal of toluene ethyl benzene m p xylene and o xylene decreased by 65 8 26 15 5 and 31 2 respectively when ffr was doubled from 0 2 to 0 4 m3 h this behaviour is more pronounced in the case of toluene and ethyl benzene as can be seen also in the graphs of the concentration decay with electrolysis time in fig s3 supplementary information the above mentioned behavior differs from the one observed with phenol 31 where a similar flow rate increase did not affect phenol degradation considering the much larger solubility of phenol in comparison to btex compounds due to the polarized oh group of phenol the decline in btex removal efficiency with ffr could be explained by the different oxidation mechanisms occurring in the cell in combination with the suppressed volatilization of btex at high recirculation flow rates while the reaction with bdd oh is favored in the case of phenol manifested in the respective enhancement of toc removal 31 the reaction with oxidants in the bulk seems to be dominant in the case of btex this speciation in the case of btex is attributed to the decreased degradation and consequently mineralization of the four aforementioned compounds since the indirect reaction with chlorine or sulfate active species is less effective in comparison to the reaction with bdd oh radicals 3 2 3 effect of btex initial concentration a similar to ffr effect was observed also in the case of the initial btex concentration as expected the lower the hydrocarbon concentration the faster the btex removal fig 3c this is verified also by the pseudo first order kinetic constants calculated for initial btex concentrations 0 5 and 2 5 mg l fig s4 supplementary information with the exception of benzene for which a slight increase in the kinetic constant of approx 6 was observed from 0 017 to 0 018 min 1 the kinetic constants for the other four hydrocarbons decreased to different extents toluene by 93 2 from 0 364 to 0 025 min 1 ethyl benzene by 85 4 from 0 171 to 0 025 min 1 m p xylene by 20 3 from 0 281 to 0 224 min 1 and o xylene by 8 4 from 0 166 to 0 152 min 1 3 3 validation of the correlation models with the aid of design expert software the models that best correlated the responses and the independent variables shown in table 2 are as follows i reduced quadratic models 8 benzene 161 37 2 75 j 48 76 btex 0 02 j 2 12 55 btex 2 9 toluene 74 02 158 57 ffr 36 16 btex 170 25 ffr btex 23 95 btex 2 10 ethyl benzene 44 24 1358 9 ffr 73 43 btex 155 62 ffr btex 2162 55 ffr 2 34 27 btex 2 11 m p xylene 128 69 277 09 ffr 9 29 btex 37 37 ffr btex 524 43 ffr 2 ii reduced 2fi model 12 o xylene 84 96 12 09 ffr 12 64 ffr btex all models were validated by the analysis of variances anova and the results are summarized in table s2 supplementary information the statistical significance was assessed by means of fisher s test the model f values calculated for the lack of fit of the four quadratic and the one 2fi models were 14 01 6 59 18 01 12 81 and 4 15 respectively suggesting that the models are significant similar conclusions can be drawn from the low probability values p value at a 95 confidence level 0 05 for the five models table s2 supplementary information the statistical significance of the reduced quadratic models for benzene toluene and ethyl benzene is also verified from fig 4 since the actual values of the percentage removal of the three hydrocarbons are randomly distributed around the mean of predicted values the value of determination coefficient r2 for the three compounds is 0 8236 0 6872 and 0 8911 respectively which means that approx 18 31 and 11 of the total variations were not satisfactorily explained by the respective models though these values would be considered statistically low they can be accepted due to the complex interaction pattern taking place during the oxidation reactions at the bdd anode surface and the bulk which could not be fully accounted for by the model equations according to the anova analysis table s2 supplementary information the effects of the three independent variables a j b ffr c btex are different between the five hydrocarbons in the case of benzene factors j and btex are the most significant for toluene btex is the most significant model term whereas the interaction of btex with ffr bc is also obvious p value 0 0171 the interaction between btex and ffr is evident for ethyl benzene and the two xylenes p values 0 05 with btex and ffr being the most significant model terms for ethyl benzene and m p xylene whereas ffr is the only significant term in the 2fi model of o xylene 3 4 optimization by response surface methodology the contour plots fig 5 a and response surface plots fig 5b obtained with the aid of design expert software help identify the interrelationship between the variables j ffr and btex and provide a three dimensional view of the changes in the btex removal efficiency for different combinations of independent variables these rsm plots are functions of two independent variables which maintain the third variable at constant point and help determine the optimum experimental conditions for maximum response btex removal as verified by the anova analysis the elimination of benzene is only correlated well with current density meaning that the direct oxidation of the respective molecule is charge controlled on the contrary there is greater dependence of the toluene ethyl benzene and the two xylenes elimination rates on the initial btex concentration and feed flow rate however these two factors affect differently the elimination of the four hydrocarbons as illustrated also in the different rsm plots in fig 5 b while toluene removal increases at low btex and high feed flow rates o xylene is better eliminated at low feed flow rates and high initial concentrations on the other hand ethyl benzene and m p xylene exhibit maximum removal efficiencies at varied combinations of the two variables specifically there exist regions where one observes neither increasing nor decreasing trend in their removal a number of 55 solutions of optimum j ffr and btex values were proposed by the statistical software yielding maximum benzene toluene ethyl benzene m p xylene and o xylene removal efficiency among the solutions proposed the first solution presenting an excellent desirability of 0 953 was selected as the optimum one this solution required j 74 ma cm2 ffr 0 2 m3 h for a target btex of 2 5 mg l which is representative of the btex content in typical wastewaters originating from hydraulic fracturing operations under these conditions a set of experiments was conducted aiming to validate the correlation models eqs 8 12 the results of two replicate experiments under the aforementioned optimum conditions are summarized in table 4 the relative errors were below 10 and 1 for benzene and the other four hydrocarbons respectively demonstrating the excellent fitting of the experimental results actual values with those predicted by the five models 3 5 comparison with literature results various electrode materials have been examined in literature for the elimination of hydrocarbons from wastewaters including btex ranging from active anodes such as iro2 ruo2 pt and composites to non active anodes such as sno2 pbo2 or bdd the pbo2 active anode however is not recommended for electrochemical applications since this electrode at high cl concentrations brine and saline wastewaters can release toxic lead ions in the treated solution 36 selected results reported for the treatment of petroleum effluents are summarized in table 5 together with those of the present work from table 5 it is evident that the efficient treatment of petrochemical effluents is strongly dependent on anode materials as well as on the nature of the effluent i e type of electrolyte and the operating conditions such as current density chloride concentration and feed flow rate the anode material and current density have greater contribution to the removal efficiency furthermore the results clearly suggest that with the bdd anode significantly better performance is achieved on organic matter elimination than with other anode materials at a lower consumption of energy this is attributed to the bbd greater oxidation capability due to the high reactivity of the strong oxidant species electrogenerated on this electrode type the feed flow rate plays a crucial role as observed in this work and the work carried out by ramalho et al 39 since organic pollutants degradation is reduced at increased flow rates this suggests that electrochemical oxidation is controlled by the rate at which organic molecules are transferred from the bulk liquid to the electrode surface and their indirect oxidation on the anode by electrogenerated oxidants although no consensus has been reached on the oxidation mechanisms or the role of electrolyte composition on the overall oxidation efficiency it is generally agreed that the different cl and so4 2 concentrations in the wastewater can drastically affect the oxidation performance due to the in situ electrogeneration of strong oxidant species i e cl2 hclo clo and s2o8 2 it must be kept in mind however that high conductivity of the electrolyte leads to faster electron transport and better degradation rate for organic pollutants consequently lowering the cell voltage for a given current density and leading to reduced energy consumption energy consumption is an important factor in electrochemical treatment of wastewaters along with high removal efficiency low specific energy consumption is a basic requirement for a treatment system the energy consumption in this work has been calculated by eq 13 at a given electrolysis time t h at the optimum operating conditions j 74 ma cm2 or current value i 7 4 a for an average cell potential ecell 8 v and solution volume vs 5 l 13 e n e r g y c o n s u m p t i o n k w h m 3 e c e l l i t v s literature data included in table 5 suggest that bdd consumes less energy than other anode materials with the exception of the work by dos santos et al 42 it is noted that the estimated energy consumption in kwh m3 reported for batch electrolytic cells i e stirred tank reactors are enormous and not representative of the actual process on the contrary the values reported for electrolytic flow cells as in this work are moderate varying in the case of bdd from 1 to 24 kw h m3 for the near optimum operating conditions determined in this work btex can be effectively eliminated in highly saline waters with energy consumption 5 92 kw h m3 considered modest in comparison with tested alternative treatment schemes for the treatment of brine wastes the improved energy efficiency avoiding use of chemicals the operation at mild conditions and the zero production of secondary effluents render electrochemical oxidation a promising alternative over other conventional technologies including membranes physical biological thermal or chemical treatments the selection of electrochemical oxidation is also supported by a recent techno economic analysis performed by stirling et al 43 where electrochemical oxidation is benchmarked against commercially available carbon block adsorption in that study a promising scenario for electro catalytic devices to overcome commercially available technologies is presented and the key challenges and research needs are identified for removing capital cost limitations such as the increased bdd electrode cost towards industrial applications 3 6 changes in seawater physical properties during electrolysis according to table 6 during seawater electrolysis the values of the recorded properties ph conductivity orp and temperature are altered at different extent specifically ph decreased by 1 7 3 4 units during the first 15 30 min of electrolysis and then stabilized at values close to neutral fig 6 the generation of protons h by the anodic reactions 2 5 and 7 seems to justify this behavior as their respective concentration is greater at smaller current densities larger ph drop at 50 ma cm2 table 6 obviously the larger the current density the larger the reduction of the h on the cathode towards the production of oh h2o2 and or h2 further it is well known that more acidic solutions favor aerobic conditions and more positive redox potential while alkaline solutions favor anaerobic conditions indeed a drastic increase in the oxygen reduction potential was observed with electrolysis with the highest orp elevation recorded at the lower current density value such an increase in redox potential is characteristic of the gradual electrogeneration of oxidizing substances in the bulk like persulfate and active chlorine species by reactions 3 4 as well as the anodic generation of o2 gas by reactions 5 and 7 this trend seems to be mitigated at higher current densities table 6 probably due to the initiation of competitive reactions on the anode that reduce the concentration of oxidant species in the bulk i e chlorine evolution can be decreased due to its transformation to its lesser reactive form of hypochlorous acid eq 14 44 such a decline in orp enhancement is also in agreement with the results of btex oxidation at higher current densities 14 cl2 aq 2h2o 2hocl 2h the recirculation of the feed solution in the cell was followed by a minor reduction of the electric conductivity of the seawater probably due to the loss of dissolved chlorides in form of gaseous chlorine eq 4 on the contrary a significant increase in solution temperature was observed as a result of the batch operation of the system and the applied current in the cell however temperature never exceeded 40 c within the two hours of electrolysis in all pilot runs it is also noted that no pressure drop was observed throughout the pilot runs with the recorded values being fairly stable in the range of 0 4 0 5 bar 4 conclusions for the low concentration of btex in wastewater produced in oilfield operations as btex represents only 1 of organic matter in produced water the removal by conventional wastewater treatment methods is difficult due to their toxic and recalcitrant nature considering btex persistence in the aquatic environment their removal has become a necessity the viability of the bdd anodic oxidation process to remove btex was investigated by performing a systematic pilot study aiming to evaluate the oxidation mechanisms and to optimize the experimental conditions such as current density feed water flow rate concentration of btex for electrochemical decomposition the results of this work are in general agreement with literature and confirm the practical applicability of the bdd electrode for the efficient removal and mineralization of btex from saline wastewater the process efficiency is attributed both to direct anodic oxidation and indirect oxidation by the in situ electrogenerated chemical oxidant species such as h2o2 persulfate and active chlorine in high salinity and high chloride content waters like the seawater tested in this work the indirect oxidation pathway apparently prevails for the four mono aromatic hydrocarbons toluene ethyl benzene m p xylene o xylene used in this work but not for benzene for which a charge controlled elimination prevails characterizing anodic oxidation the electrochemical oxidation of the above four compounds is controlled by mass transfer to the anode surface from the bulk which seems to be favored at low initial pollutant concentrations and at high current densities however further investigation of the degradation mechanisms is necessary in future research works that should involve higher btex concentrations as well as measurements of the formation of low molecular weight chlorinated compounds and perchlorates in the

correlation models optimization 1 introduction nowadays huge amounts of highly saline wastewaters that are characterized by a multitude of inorganic and organic contaminants including heavy metals e g zinc lead manganese iron barium dissolved organics including toxic hydrocarbons and other pollutants e g oil and grease bacteria and nutrients are typically disposed of in the environment thus posing environmental and ecological risks 1 2 typical examples are brine wastes that originate from the hydraulic fracturing operations in the oil and gas industries flowback and or produced water 3 landfill leachate 4 acid rock and mine drainage 5 chlor alkali plant waste 6 chemical manufacturing 7 8 food processing 9 etc due to shortage of water resources and safety and health concerns associated with traditional disposal techniques e g underground injection discharge to streams rivers and other surface water bodies discharge in standard sewage treatment plants evaporation ponds and land application 10 11 treatment and possible reuse of such wastewaters have become emerging needs the treatment of polluted saline wastewaters by biological processes e g activated sludge is not recommended due to the adverse effects of salts and toxic compounds on the bacteria communities and the existence of residual chemicals in the sewage sludge and the discharge water 12 conventional oxidation methods such as chlorination or ozonation could lead to the formation of toxic byproducts 13 while adsorption on activated carbon or other filter media e g zeolites biochar present several limitations in treatment cost and handling of saturated exhausted filter materials 14 15 pressure driven membrane processes e g nanofiltration reverse osmosis 16 17 and other modern membrane technologies e g membrane distillation forward osmosis have been also considered for both total dissolved solids salts hardness and dissolved organics removal from high saline wastewaters 18 19 however membrane fouling due to organic matter inorganic colloids and micro organisms biofouling is the main disadvantage of these technologies which necessitates feed pre treatment higher pressure requirements during operation and frequent chemical cleanings with obvious negative consequences furthermore pollutants are transferred from one stream to another rather than removed as chemical content is concentrated in the rejection stream 16 17 the convenient application of electrical current instead of chemicals prompted researchers to develop electrochemical wastewater treatment technologies for the prevention of pollution problems 20 24 electro fenton ef and anodic oxidation ao are major representatives of the electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops that have been proven very effective towards the degradation and mineralization of recalcitrant organics present in saline waters offering distinct advantages for large scale applications such as versatility energy efficiency amenability of automation the possibility to avoid addition of chemicals and safety because they operate at mild conditions 25 27 in a recent comprehensive review brillas and garcia segura 28 provide a benchmarking framework of novel ef and related processes based on the oxidation of phenol as model compound and highlight the engineering challenges that need to be successfully addressed toward novel technology commercialization among such challenges the satisfactory long term performance in a realistic operational environment critically determines the technology readiness level of these technologies 29 for example the electrochemical oxidation process applied to brine wastes characterized by a high chloride content resulted in improved performance for organic pollutants degradation due to the formation of reactive chlorine species during electrolysis thus designated as electrochlorination process ecl 22 30 31 in a recent work of the authors a hybrid eaop that couples ao and ecl was greatly effective for the degradation mineralization of phenol compounds in strongly saline waters with reduced specific energy consumption 31 encouraged by the good results of this work the present study was undertaken to investigate the hybrid ao ecl process for removing mono aromatic hydrocarbons benzene toluene ethyl benzene and xylenes referred to as btex from highly saline waters btex are common pollutants found in industrial effluents e g oilfield produced water effluents of industries that utilize petrochemicals for the production of paints adhesives inks and rubber municipal landfill sites as well as in groundwater due to accidental events such as oil spills and oil pipeline leakages 32 although btex compounds are reported to be harmful to the ecosystem and the human health 33 their treatment remains a challenge due to their refractory nature and their higher solubility in comparison to their poly aromatic counterparts polyaromatic hydrocarbons in a recent study by da costa et al 34 good performance in btex removal was achieved during the treatment of a real effluent from oil water separator of fuel station by ao using ti pt as anode the type of supporting electrolyte and solution conductivity played a crucial role in process performance and economics in another study gargouri et al 35 conducted ao of real produced water in an electrolytic batch cell using pbo2 supported on tantalum and boron doped diamond bdd anodes and found that the latter exhibit higher oxidation rates of hydrocarbon compounds with lower consumption of energy in the work of da silva et al 36 the chloride ions content in the produced water was found to be a significant parameter because it promoted the electrogeneration of chlorine species thus leading to improved process efficiency to gain a better understanding on the efficiency and applicability of a chlorine enhanced eaop to treat btex in high salinity waters experiments were conducted in a pilot electrochemical unit with btex concentrations that simulate those found in wastewaters produced in oilfield operations in an effort to assess the technology readiness level of the aforementioned electrochemical process and its potential commercialization a real water matrix of increased salinity and chloride content i e seawater was used under realistic operating conditions thus possible discrepancies and unrepresentative results associated with the use of synthetic solutions could be avoided 29 in the following the experimental work is described first operational parameter optimization and modeling using the response surface methodology rsm is performed next for evaluating the effect of key operating parameters 2 experimental work 2 1 materials analytical grade chemicals were used as received benzene was supplied by merck germany toluene and ethyl benzene by sigma aldrich germany and xylenes by fluka switzerland at minimum purity of 99 5 1 0 g l btex stock solution was prepared by weighing 1 g of each compound in 1 l methanol and then mixed thoroughly subsequently feed water solutions were prepared with the addition of appropriate amounts of btex standard in seawater collected from the arabian gulf as shown in table 1 the seawater used in the experiments is highly saline presents high conductivity high chloride content and a total dissolved solids tds concentration of approx 38 300 mg l while the presence of organics toc is rather modest 2 2 electrochemical pilot scale plant a laboratory scale electrochemical treatment system ets pilot

hmi 2 3 experimental procedure aqueous feed solutions spiked with 0 5 1 25 and 2 5 mg l of btex compounds were circulated at various rates 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 m3 hr through the undivided electrochemical cell the range of btex concentration was selected taking into consideration typical concentrations of btex in wastewaters from oilfield operations produced water 17 in order to attain a homogenize feed the solution was initially recirculated at a high flow rate of 0 4 m3 h until parameters such as conductivity orp and ph readings are stable in both inlet and outlet of the cell after which the power supply was turned on and the experiment began the concentration levels of benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes m p xylene o xylene in the saline water samples collected at certain time intervals i e 0 15 30 60 and 120 min were measured using the gc ms the total organic carbon toc concentrations were not measured due to the low btex and background organic concentrations 0 3 mg l tested in this work 2 4 analytical methods and measurements btex degradation was assessed using thermo scientific trace gc ultra equipped with mass spectrometer and triplus head space autosampler the fused silica gc capillary column used was 60 m long with 0 32 mm internal diameter and a film thickness of 1 8 μm restek rtx 502 2 the carrier gas was high purity helium gas set at a constant flow rate of 1 0 ml min the injector temperature was 225 c while ms transfer line and ion source were set at 280 c and 250 c respectively prior to injection 25 ml sample vial containing 1 ml aqueous sample was incubated for 5 min in head space agitator set at 90 c also the gc oven conditions were set such that initial temperature of 40 c was held for 2 min and then ramped at 5 c min to reach 165 c and finally at 30 c min until 250 c and held for 2 min 2 5 experimental design experimental design by response surface methodology rsm was employed to optimize the electrochemical oxidation efficiency of btex in highly saline waters three independent factors namely the electric current density j factor a the feed flow rate ffr factor b and btex concentration btex factor c were correlated with the desired responses maximizing benzene toluene ethyl benzene m p xylene o xylene percentage removal in comparison to previous work with phenol 31 feeding air to the carbon ptfe cathode was not considered in this study due to its negative effect on the overall process performance determination of percentage removal was made at a fixed time of treatment according to the following equation 1 r c i c t c i x 100 where r is percentage of each btex compound benzene toluene ethyl benzene m p xylene o xylene removed ci and ct are the initial and final concentrations of each compound at electrolysis time t the three independent variables varied over three levels between 1 and 1 at determined ranges chosen based on previous research 31 and literature survey table 2 to determine the effect of the three variables on btex removal the most widely used approach of rsm was employed i e central composite design ccd and speciﬁcally a face centered composite fcc design to obtain optimum values of independent variables this approach resulted in 17 experiments table 3 it is noted that 10 additional experiments were performed at intermediate values allowing elucidation of the effect of process variables on btex treatment performance experimental data were fitted to the optimum mathematical model for each btex compound which was subsequently confirmed using graphs and analysis of variance anova the accuracy and applicability of the proposed models from rsm were evaluated by the statistical f value and the coefficient of determination r2 for the parameters studied the significance of all model coefficients was judged based on the probability value p 0 05 with 95 confidence level three dimensional response surface plots were drawn for the visualization of the interaction effects of the independent operational parameters on btex compounds removal finally an optimization was performed on the basis of the desirability function to determine the optimal conditions for btex removal numerical optimization was used to identify the specific point that maximizes the desirability function the experimental design statistical analysis response surface plots and optimization were performed using design expert v 11 1 2 0 software program stat ease inc minneapolis mn usa 3 results discussion 3 1 preliminary experiments considering the rather low range of btex concentrations applied and the moderate volatility of the respective compounds table s1 supplementary information a series of preliminary experiments were carried out in the absence of electric current aiming to assess the loss of each compound during the recirculation of feed solution in the pilot unit the results of a total nine experiments performed in duplicates are shown in fig s1 supplementary information where the loss of each of the five btex compounds after 120 min of seawater recirculation has been calculated for three different btex and ffr values according to fig s1 supplementary information the loss of btex compounds at 0 2 m3 h ffr followed the order ethyl benzene m p xylene o xylene toluene benzene a decline in the loss of all compounds was observed with the increased ffr with the exception of o xylene which exhibited a larger loss with increasing ffr in the case of btex the larger the initial concentration of all compounds in the mixture the lower was the loss during their recirculation in the pilot unit specifically at 2 5 mg l initial concentration of btex the loss of benzene varied from 9 8 25 4 of toluene from 0 to 16 9 of ethyl benzene from 0 to 23 1 of m p xylene from 0 to 13 4 and of o xylene from 0 to 17 1 for the aqueous system examined one way to explain the above results may be from the view point of btex adsorption on the carbon based cathode and the potential volatilization of the five compounds during the recirculation of the feed water both adsorption and volatilization can be affected by the variation of btex solubility in water i e larger solubility will tend to suppress the rate of adsorption and volatilization indeed the low water solubilities and the higher henry s constants in the case of ethyl benzene and xylenes table s1 supplementary information justify their increased tendency for hydrophobic interactions on the carbon surface and their volatilization however the higher feed water velocities seem to offset this tendency probably due to the better mixing and solubility of all compounds in the water matrix according to literature 37 the solubility of organic compounds decreases with increasing salinity salting out however the effect of brine on the suppression of btex volatilization is expected to be insignificant for the seawater employed in this work chao et al 38 report that a high concentration of nacl i e 35 000 mg l in water does not alter significantly the volatilization of btex it is noted that in real wastewaters as those mentioned in introduction btex compounds are dissolved together with other organic compounds e g phenols surfactants etc which can alter the solubility of btex in water and consequently the rate of their volatilization according to chao et al 38 the solubility of non ionic organic compounds like btex is enhanced due to their partitioning with the additional organic compounds and water this trend results in a suppression of the volatilization rates of btex which becomes even greater when other non polar organic compounds are dissolved 38 considering the aforementioned results the loss of btex due to volatilization is possible and needs to be taken into consideration when assessing the total removal of btex during the electrolysis ao ecl oxidation 3 2 effect of independent experimental variables on btex oxidation the results obtained from the experimental design matrix including the three independent variables j ffr btex are summarized in table 3 the responses btex are presented at electrolysis time 15 min and 30 min for which correlation models of great significance could be retrieved by the design expert programme at longer electrolysis times only mean constant models were obtained for almost all compounds this is due to the rather low btex initial concentrations and the fact that an effective oxidation of all compounds takes place during the first minutes of electrolysis this trend is clearly shown in fig 2 where the changes in btex concentration over the electrolysis time are depicted at constant current density j 100 ma cm2 and high feed flow rate ffr 0 4 m3 h among the five btex molecules xylenes exhibited the fastest removal rates being completely removed 100 within 30 min of electrolysis at the specified conditions more than 90 of toluene and ethyl benzene were removed within 90 min while 70 80 of benzene was removed within 120 min 3 2 1 effect of current density the effect of the three independent experimental variables on btex removal is shown in fig 3 as expected btex removal is drastically enhanced at higher current densities fig 3a this is more evident in the case of benzene toluene and o xylene for which an increase of three two and two orders of magnitude are observed respectively by doubling the current density in the cell these results are in accord with authors previous study with phenol 31 and the works reported in literature with btex and other petroleum hydrocarbons using different types of anodes i e ti pt ti iro2 ta2o5 and bdd anodes by da costa et al 34 and da silva et al 36 pbo2 supported on tantalum and bdd anodes by gargouri et al 35 and ti iro2 ta2o5 and ruo2 tio2 sno2 anode by ramalho et al 39 the increase in current density favours the in situ generation of strong oxidants either directly at the anode surface bdd oh by reaction 2 40 or indirectly in the bulk persulfate and active chlorine species by reactions 3 4 24 41 thus favoring the oxidation of btex compounds in shorter time 2 bdd h2o bdd oh h e 3 2so4 2 s2o8 2 2e 4 2cl cl2 g 2e however the removal rate after the first 15 30 min of electrolysis is not significantly affected by the current density since the percentage removal for each of the five compounds is similar regardless of the current density applied fig s2 supplementary information specifically the concentration decay of all compounds is linear during the first minutes of electrolysis following next an exponential mode that occurs at different rates for each compound this behavior is more pronounced at increased current densities and is attributed to the activation of competitive and parasitic reactions the latter involve primarily the oxidation of bdd oh to o2 at the anode by reaction 5 its dimerization to the less oxidant h2o2 by reaction 6 or the direct o2 evolution from water eq 7 24 40 5 bdd oh 2bdd o2 2h 2e 6 bdd oh 2bdd h2o2 7 2h2o o2 4h 4e 3 2 2 effect of feed flow rate the effect of feed flow rate on btex removal is shown in fig 3 b according to the preliminary experiments the increased flow rate favours the mixing of the five hydrocarbons and therefore their solubility in the feed solution this has reduced the loss of compounds due to volatilization loss less than 15 and has enhanced their mass transport both at the anode surface thus promoting their direct oxidation by bdd oh radicals and in the bulk thus enhancing their indirect oxidation due to reaction with the in situ generated oxidants cl2 s2o8 2 with the exception of benzene the increased recirculation flow rate of the seawater in the cell was followed by a reduced removal of the four mono aromatic hydrocarbons specifically at applied current density 100 ma cm2 and btex initial concentration 2 5 mg l the removal of toluene ethyl benzene m p xylene and o xylene decreased by 65 8 26 15 5 and 31 2 respectively when ffr was doubled from 0 2 to 0 4 m3 h this behaviour is more pronounced in the case of toluene and ethyl benzene as can be seen also in the graphs of the concentration decay with electrolysis time in fig s3 supplementary information the above mentioned behavior differs from the one observed with phenol 31 where a similar flow rate increase did not affect phenol degradation considering the much larger solubility of phenol in comparison to btex compounds due to the polarized oh group of phenol the decline in btex removal efficiency with ffr could be explained by the different oxidation mechanisms occurring in the cell in combination with the suppressed volatilization of btex at high recirculation flow rates while the reaction with bdd oh is favored in the case of phenol manifested in the respective enhancement of toc removal 31 the reaction with oxidants in the bulk seems to be dominant in the case of btex this speciation in the case of btex is attributed to the decreased degradation and consequently mineralization of the four aforementioned compounds since the indirect reaction with chlorine or sulfate active species is less effective in comparison to the reaction with bdd oh radicals 3 2 3 effect of btex initial concentration a similar to ffr effect was observed also in the case of the initial btex concentration as expected the lower the hydrocarbon concentration the faster the btex removal fig 3c this is verified also by the pseudo first order kinetic constants calculated for initial btex concentrations 0 5 and 2 5 mg l fig s4 supplementary information with the exception of benzene for which a slight increase in the kinetic constant of approx 6 was observed from 0 017 to 0 018 min 1 the kinetic constants for the other four hydrocarbons decreased to different extents toluene by 93 2 from 0 364 to 0 025 min 1 ethyl benzene by 85 4 from 0 171 to 0 025 min 1 m p xylene by 20 3 from 0 281 to 0 224 min 1 and o xylene by 8 4 from 0 166 to 0 152 min 1 3 3 validation of the correlation models with the aid of design expert software the models that best correlated the responses and the independent variables shown in table 2 are as follows i reduced quadratic models 8 benzene 161 37 2 75 j 48 76 btex 0 02 j 2 12 55 btex 2 9 toluene 74 02 158 57 ffr 36 16 btex 170 25 ffr btex 23 95 btex 2 10 ethyl benzene 44 24 1358 9 ffr 73 43 btex 155 62 ffr btex 2162 55 ffr 2 34 27 btex 2 11 m p xylene 128 69 277 09 ffr 9 29 btex 37 37 ffr btex 524 43 ffr 2 ii reduced 2fi model 12 o xylene 84 96 12 09 ffr 12 64 ffr btex all models were validated by the analysis of variances anova and the results are summarized in table s2 supplementary information the statistical significance was assessed by means of fisher s test the model f values calculated for the lack of fit of the four quadratic and the one 2fi models were 14 01 6 59 18 01 12 81 and 4 15 respectively suggesting that the models are significant similar conclusions can be drawn from the low probability values p value at a 95 confidence level 0 05 for the five models table s2 supplementary information the statistical significance of the reduced quadratic models for benzene toluene and ethyl benzene is also verified from fig 4 since the actual values of the percentage removal of the three hydrocarbons are randomly distributed around the mean of predicted values the value of determination coefficient r2 for the three compounds is 0 8236 0 6872 and 0 8911 respectively which means that approx 18 31 and 11 of the total variations were not satisfactorily explained by the respective models though these values would be considered statistically low they can be accepted due to the complex interaction pattern taking place during the oxidation reactions at the bdd anode surface and the bulk which could not be fully accounted for by the model equations according to the anova analysis table s2 supplementary information the effects of the three independent variables a j b ffr c btex are different between the five hydrocarbons in the case of benzene factors j and btex are the most significant for toluene btex is the most significant model term whereas the interaction of btex with ffr bc is also obvious p value 0 0171 the interaction between btex and ffr is evident for ethyl benzene and the two xylenes p values 0 05 with btex and ffr being the most significant model terms for ethyl benzene and m p xylene whereas ffr is the only significant term in the 2fi model of o xylene 3 4 optimization by response surface methodology the contour plots fig 5 a and response surface plots fig 5b obtained with the aid of design expert software help identify the interrelationship between the variables j ffr and btex and provide a three dimensional view of the changes in the btex removal efficiency for different combinations of independent variables these rsm plots are functions of two independent variables which maintain the third variable at constant point and help determine the optimum experimental conditions for maximum response btex removal as verified by the anova analysis the elimination of benzene is only correlated well with current density meaning that the direct oxidation of the respective molecule is charge controlled on the contrary there is greater dependence of the toluene ethyl benzene and the two xylenes elimination rates on the initial btex concentration and feed flow rate however these two factors affect differently the elimination of the four hydrocarbons as illustrated also in the different rsm plots in fig 5 b while toluene removal increases at low btex and high feed flow rates o xylene is better eliminated at low feed flow rates and high initial concentrations on the other hand ethyl benzene and m p xylene exhibit maximum removal efficiencies at varied combinations of the two variables specifically there exist regions where one observes neither increasing nor decreasing trend in their removal a number of 55 solutions of optimum j ffr and btex values were proposed by the statistical software yielding maximum benzene toluene ethyl benzene m p xylene and o xylene removal efficiency among the solutions proposed the first solution presenting an excellent desirability of 0 953 was selected as the optimum one this solution required j 74 ma cm2 ffr 0 2 m3 h for a target btex of 2 5 mg l which is representative of the btex content in typical wastewaters originating from hydraulic fracturing operations under these conditions a set of experiments was conducted aiming to validate the correlation models eqs 8 12 the results of two replicate experiments under the aforementioned optimum conditions are summarized in table 4 the relative errors were below 10 and 1 for benzene and the other four hydrocarbons respectively demonstrating the excellent fitting of the experimental results actual values with those predicted by the five models 3 5 comparison with literature results various electrode materials have been examined in literature for the elimination of hydrocarbons from wastewaters including btex ranging from active anodes such as iro2 ruo2 pt and composites to non active anodes such as sno2 pbo2 or bdd the pbo2 active anode however is not recommended for electrochemical applications since this electrode at high cl concentrations brine and saline wastewaters can release toxic lead ions in the treated solution 36 selected results reported for the treatment of petroleum effluents are summarized in table 5 together with those of the present work from table 5 it is evident that the efficient treatment of petrochemical effluents is strongly dependent on anode materials as well as on the nature of the effluent i e type of electrolyte and the operating conditions such as current density chloride concentration and feed flow rate the anode material and current density have greater contribution to the removal efficiency furthermore the results clearly suggest that with the bdd anode significantly better performance is achieved on organic matter elimination than with other anode materials at a lower consumption of energy this is attributed to the bbd greater oxidation capability due to the high reactivity of the strong oxidant species electrogenerated on this electrode type the feed flow rate plays a crucial role as observed in this work and the work carried out by ramalho et al 39 since organic pollutants degradation is reduced at increased flow rates this suggests that electrochemical oxidation is controlled by the rate at which organic molecules are transferred from the bulk liquid to the electrode surface and their indirect oxidation on the anode by electrogenerated oxidants although no consensus has been reached on the oxidation mechanisms or the role of electrolyte composition on the overall oxidation efficiency it is generally agreed that the different cl and so4 2 concentrations in the wastewater can drastically affect the oxidation performance due to the in situ electrogeneration of strong oxidant species i e cl2 hclo clo and s2o8 2 it must be kept in mind however that high conductivity of the electrolyte leads to faster electron transport and better degradation rate for organic pollutants consequently lowering the cell voltage for a given current density and leading to reduced energy consumption energy consumption is an important factor in electrochemical treatment of wastewaters along with high removal efficiency low specific energy consumption is a basic requirement for a treatment system the energy consumption in this work has been calculated by eq 13 at a given electrolysis time t h at the optimum operating conditions j 74 ma cm2 or current value i 7 4 a for an average cell potential ecell 8 v and solution volume vs 5 l 13 e n e r g y c o n s u m p t i o n k w h m 3 e c e l l i t v s literature data included in table 5 suggest that bdd consumes less energy than other anode materials with the exception of the work by dos santos et al 42 it is noted that the estimated energy consumption in kwh m3 reported for batch electrolytic cells i e stirred tank reactors are enormous and not representative of the actual process on the contrary the values reported for electrolytic flow cells as in this work are moderate varying in the case of bdd from 1 to 24 kw h m3 for the near optimum operating conditions determined in this work btex can be effectively eliminated in highly saline waters with energy consumption 5 92 kw h m3 considered modest in comparison with tested alternative treatment schemes for the treatment of brine wastes the improved energy efficiency avoiding use of chemicals the operation at mild conditions and the zero production of secondary effluents render electrochemical oxidation a promising alternative over other conventional technologies including membranes physical biological thermal or chemical treatments the selection of electrochemical oxidation is also supported by a recent techno economic analysis performed by stirling et al 43 where electrochemical oxidation is benchmarked against commercially available carbon block adsorption in that study a promising scenario for electro catalytic devices to overcome commercially available technologies is presented and the key challenges and research needs are identified for removing capital cost limitations such as the increased bdd electrode cost towards industrial applications 3 6 changes in seawater physical properties during electrolysis according to table 6 during seawater electrolysis the values of the recorded properties ph conductivity orp and temperature are altered at different extent specifically ph decreased by 1 7 3 4 units during the first 15 30 min of electrolysis and then stabilized at values close to neutral fig 6 the generation of protons h by the anodic reactions 2 5 and 7 seems to justify this behavior as their respective concentration is greater at smaller current densities larger ph drop at 50 ma cm2 table 6 obviously the larger the current density the larger the reduction of the h on the cathode towards the production of oh h2o2 and or h2 further it is well known that more acidic solutions favor aerobic conditions and more positive redox potential while alkaline solutions favor anaerobic conditions indeed a drastic increase in the oxygen reduction potential was observed with electrolysis with the highest orp elevation recorded at the lower current density value such an increase in redox potential is characteristic of the gradual electrogeneration of oxidizing substances in the bulk like persulfate and active chlorine species by reactions 3 4 as well as the anodic generation of o2 gas by reactions 5 and 7 this trend seems to be mitigated at higher current densities table 6 probably due to the initiation of competitive reactions on the anode that reduce the concentration of oxidant species in the bulk i e chlorine evolution can be decreased due to its transformation to its lesser reactive form of hypochlorous acid eq 14 44 such a decline in orp enhancement is also in agreement with the results of btex oxidation at higher current densities 14 cl2 aq 2h2o 2hocl 2h the recirculation of the feed solution in the cell was followed by a minor reduction of the electric conductivity of the seawater probably due to the loss of dissolved chlorides in form of gaseous chlorine eq 4 on the contrary a significant increase in solution temperature was observed as a result of the batch operation of the system and the applied current in the cell however temperature never exceeded 40 c within the two hours of electrolysis in all pilot runs it is also noted that no pressure drop was observed throughout the pilot runs with the recorded values being fairly stable in the range of 0 4 0 5 bar 4 conclusions for the low concentration of btex in wastewater produced in oilfield operations as btex represents only 1 of organic matter in produced water the removal by conventional wastewater treatment methods is difficult due to their toxic and recalcitrant nature considering btex persistence in the aquatic environment their removal has become a necessity the viability of the bdd anodic oxidation process to remove btex was investigated by performing a systematic pilot study aiming to evaluate the oxidation mechanisms and to optimize the experimental conditions such as current density feed water flow rate concentration of btex for electrochemical decomposition the results of this work are in general agreement with literature and confirm the practical applicability of the bdd electrode for the efficient removal and mineralization of btex from saline wastewater the process efficiency is attributed both to direct anodic oxidation and indirect oxidation by the in situ electrogenerated chemical oxidant species such as h2o2 persulfate and active chlorine in high salinity and high chloride content waters like the seawater tested in this work the indirect oxidation pathway apparently prevails for the four mono aromatic hydrocarbons toluene ethyl benzene m p xylene o xylene used in this work but not for benzene for which a charge controlled elimination prevails characterizing anodic oxidation the electrochemical oxidation of the above four compounds is controlled by mass transfer to the anode surface from the bulk which seems to be favored at low initial pollutant concentrations and at high current densities however further investigation of the degradation mechanisms is necessary in future research works that should involve higher btex concentrations as well as measurements of the formation of low molecular weight chlorinated compounds and perchlorates in the

approximately 15 i e 583 billion cubic meters bcm of the total worldwide water withdrawal was used for energy production out of which 11 3 66 bcm was consumed in the oil refining process 1 the refining process consumes a lot of energy and up to 10 of the energy contained in crude oil is consumed in its processing it has been reported that in the u s 1 1 9 gallons 3 8 7 2 l of fresh water is consumed for refining 1 gallon 3 8 l of crude oil water consumption varies for specific refinery products such as gasoline 0 60 to 0 71 l water l gasoline jet fuel 0 09 l water l and diesel 0 90 l water l 1 in general 3 5 to 5 m3 of petroleum refinery wastewater prw is generated per ton of crude oil processed in the global scale 5 34 m3 of prw is produced daily during processing of 13 3 m3 of crude oil 2 due to more stringent environmental standards prw treatment cost has gone up and in addition to that the scarcity of low cost freshwater has given the oil refining industries incentive to reduce water consumption and wastewater generation various petroleum derived pollutants are present in prw including phenolics long chain hydrocarbons pahs heterocyclic compounds and heavy metals 3 specific refinery operations such as crude oil desalting distillation both atmospheric and vacuum thermal catalytic and hydrocracking polymerization alkylation isomerization catalytic reforming solvent refining hydrotreating grease processing drying and sweetening finishing of lube oil blending packaging and equipment cleaning along with oil spills generate a huge volume of wastewater the wastewater is subjected to physicochemical biological and tertiary or polishing treatment in preliminary secondary and tertiary treatment units respectively if the treated wastewater is of high quality a part of it is reused in various cooling units depending on process sensitivity 4 in a conventional prw treatment plant preliminary treatment units include equalization flocculation oil removal using parallel plate interceptors or chemically assisted dissolved air flotation chemical precipitation and filtration among various secondary treatment units activated sludge rotating biological contactors trickling filters aerated lagoons and oxidation ponds are most common tertiary treatment includes polishing filters and polishing ponds researchers have investigated various treatment options for prw such as adsorption biological treatment membrane filtration membrane bioreactors electrochemical oxidation and fenton oxidation however biological treatment is reported to be the most efficient and economical option 4 carbazole cbz fluorene flu and dibenzothiophene dbt have been reported to be present in various wastewaters coking biomass gasification pharmaceutical sewage and wood preservative wastewater and in leachates from municipal landfills at 0 5 12 5 mg l 0 0002 6 8 mg l and 0 00001 10 8 mg l respectively 5 11 flu has been reported to be mostly associated with sewage sludge at concentrations varying from 0 77 to 11 94 μg kg 12 presence of dibenzothiophene and its alkylated analogues have been reported in lake sediments contaminated with refinery wastewater 13 14 prw often contain various pahs and heterocyclic pahs which are toxic mutagenic and sometimes carcinogenic to various organisms and human beings cbz flu and dbt which are representative compounds of the nitrogen and sulfur heterocyclic pahs and pahs containing three fused aromatic rings have been reported to be present in coking wastewater and prw at 7 8 12 5 mg l 12 5 125 mg l and 0 18 μg l to less than 0 02 mg l concentration respectively 7 8 15 16 the current study focusses on the feasibility of applying a bacterial strain pseudomonas aeruginosa rs1 for degradation of cbz dbt and flu in presence of raw prw the bacterial strain gene bank accession number kf751345 was isolated from oily sludge collected from an oil refinery mumbai india and was reported to efficiently degrade the nitrogen heterocyclic pah carbazole 17 and a four ring pah pyrene 18 it also grew well on oil extracted from oily sludge 19 ghosh and mukherji 35 reported the kinetics of cbz utilization by this strain when cbz was provided as sole substrate in an optimized mineral media raw prw was collected and was characterized based on some physicochemical parameters such as ph bod3 27 c and cod various aromatics and heterocyclic pahs in the prw were identified using gc gc tofms the first objective was to investigate the impact of adding various media components on the degradation of cbz flu and dbt each applied at 100 mg l in raw prw by p aeruginosa rs1 two sets of mixture cbz flu and dbt applied together degradation experiments were also conducted at two different initial concentration total applied concentration of 30 mg l 10 mg l of each substrate and 300 mg l 100 mg l of each substrate in order to understand substrate interaction effects at high and low substrate concentration the second objective was to check whether the bacterial strain could degrade various aromatics and heterocyclic pahs present in the prw the bacterial strain acclimatized to cbz flu dbt and their ternary mixture was tested for its capability to degrade various aromatics and heterocyclics present in the raw prw the compounds were selected based on the results obtained from gc gc tofms analyses 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and materials petroleum refinery wastewater prw was collected from the equalized influent entering the wastewater treatment plant in a refinery in mumbai the sample

various sources merck india ranbaxy india thomas baker chemicals ltd india loba chemie india and finar india 2 2 microorganisms and culture conditions p aeruginosa rs1 mtcc 25391 acclimatized to the desired substrate or substrate mixture was used as the inoculum for conducting the degradation experiments in the presence of prw supplemented with various media components initially the bacterial cells were grown in nutrient broth and the cells were harvested by centrifugation 8000 rpm for 10 min followed by washing with 2 phosphate buffer solution pbs and finally adjusting the absorbance od600 to approximately 1 8 the od adjusted culture 3 v v was used as the inoculum for acclimatizing the cells to various substrates the culture was separately acclimatized to 250 mg l of cbz flu and dbt before conducting the degradation studies with cbz flu and dbt as substrate respectively the mixture degradation experiment was conducted using an inoculum acclimatized to a mixture of these compounds 50 mg l of each compound acclimatization was carried out by growing the bacterial strain on the individual substrates and their mixtures and through multiple subculturing of the bacterial cells conducted in a shaking incubator at 37 c and 120 rpm the subculturing technique is discussed in detail elsewhere 17 after acclimatization the bacterial cells were harvested by centrifuging at 12 000 rpm for 10 min and the cell pellet was resuspended in 2 pbs the cells were washed four times using 2 pbs and finally the od600 of the cell suspension was adjusted to 1 this was used as the inoculum in each experiment 2 3 preparation of stock solution of cbz flu and dbt stock solutions of cbz flu and dbt 10 g l were prepared by dissolving solid crystals of the compounds in dichloromethane the solution was subsequently filter sterilized through a 0 2 μm membrane filter the stock solution of each compound was freshly prepared before conducting each experiment screw capped erlenmeyer flasks were sterilized and the required amount of each stock was aseptically added to each flask and the flasks were kept inside the laminar flow hood overnight for evaporating dcm completely subsequently the optimized mineral media 17 was added to the flasks and the contents were sonicated for dispersing the crystals of the compounds in the aqueous phase 2 4 preparation of

characterized by measuring its ph tss vss nh4 n po4 3 p bod and cod 24 for bod analysis greywater collected from an equalization tank in a hostel in iit bombay campus mumbai india was used as inoculum the composition of the prw was analysed using a pegasus 4d gc gc tofms combination of rxi 5 ms 30 m primary column and rxi 17sil ms 2 m secondary column both restek made in usa was used in 2d mode for

petroleum refinery wastewater in order to understand the biodegradability of cbz in presence of prw one set of experiment was set up in which the wastewater 100 was used directly without supplementing any of the salts present in the mineral media cbz 100 mg l was externally applied as carbon source and cbz acclimatized p aeruginosa rs1 was used as inoculum the batch degradation study was set up by adding 50 ml of the wastewater to each flask after adding using the method discussed in section 2 3 cbz 100 mg l as the external carbon source the flasks were sonicated to uniformly disperse the cbz crystals in wastewater the cbz acclimatized bacterial inoculum 3 v v was added to each of the flasks in two other studies 50 ml of the wastewater 100 supplemented with minerals as per the unoptimized and optimized media as mentioned in section 2 4 were used for conducting cbz degradation experiments with initial cbz concentration 100 mg l cbz acclimatized p aeruginosa rs1 was used as the inoculum another two sets of experiments were conducted in which biodegradability of flu and dbt with initial concentration 100 mg l each were investigated using prw supplemented with unoptimized and optimized media components flu and dbt acclimatized cells of p aeruginosa rs1 were used as inoculum for conducting degradation experiments on flu and dbt respectively the objective was to investigate whether the bacterial culture could efficiently degrade these compounds in presence of prwwhich is likely to contain various organic and inorganic constituents two sets of mixture degradation experiments cbz flu and dbt applied together were also conducted at two different initial concentration levels total applied concentrations of 30 mg l containing 10 mg l of each substrate and 300 mg l containing 100 mg l of each substrate p aeruginosa rs1 acclimatized to a mixture of cbz flu and dbt containing 50 mg l of each compound was used as inoculum for conducting both the experiments in presence of prw supplemented with optimized media components the main objective of these experiments was to understand substrate interaction effects at their low 30 mg l mixture and high 300 mg l mixture concentration levels the degradation characteristics of the substrates at 30 mg l total concentration is representative of contaminated wastewater extraction and quantification protocols of cbz flu and dbt are discussed in section 2 5 2 8 biodegradation of various indigenous aromatics and heterocyclic pahs in petroleum refinery wastewater and toc removal by p aeruginosa rs1 biodegradation experiments for various compounds aromatics and heterocyclic pahs present in prw were conducted separately p aeruginosa rs1 was separately acclimatized to cbz 100 mg l flu 100 mg l dbt 100 mg l and a mixture of cbz flu and dbt containing 50 mg l of each compound before use as inoculum in batch flasks 3 v v the compounds were selected based on the results obtained from gc gc tofms analyses of the prw and their degradation was monitored over a period of 14 days 37 c and 120 rpm the method of extraction and the gc oven temperature program were same as discussed previously the peak area of various compounds aromatics and heterocyclic pahs in the gc gc tofms total ion chromatograms tic obtained from the samples containing prw and bacterial inoculum acclimatized to various substrates after incubating for 14 days were compared with those obtained from the controls containing no bacterial inoculum in order to comment on degradation potential of these compounds degradation experiments were also set up in prw using p aeruginosa rs1 acclimatized to cbz 250 mg l flu 250 mg l dbt 250 mg l and a mixture of cbz flu and dbt containing 50 mg l of each compound as inoculum the objective was to monitor variation of toc over 14 days incubation using a toc analyser toc vcsh shimadzu japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of petroleum refinery wastewater table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the prw used in the present study fig 1 illustrates the major aromatics and heterocyclics detected in the prw using 4d gc gc tofms along with their retention time and similarity with the nist library spectra the mass spectra of the compounds detected in the prw and the nist library spectra are included in electronic supplementary information esi 3 2 biodegradation studies in presence of petroleum refinery wastewater 3 2 1 biodegradation studies on cbz flu and dbt present individually fig 2 a c represents the degradation profiles of 100 mg l cbz by acclimatized p aeruginosa rs1 in presence of raw prw and raw prw and distilled water supplemented with unoptimized and optimized media components respectively when raw wastewater was used 27 12 6 cbz was degraded after incubation for 14 days when raw wastewater was supplemented with unoptimized and optimized media components 47 5 2 and 69 4 3 cbz was degraded after 14 days of incubation respectively for media components spiked in distilled water together with 100 mg l cbz and inoculum 54 2 6 and 83 1 1 cbz degradation was achieved after 14 days incubation in presence of unoptimized and optimized media respectively fig 3 a and b represents the degradation profiles of flu 100 mg l by acclimatized p aeruginosa rs1 in presence of raw prw supplemented with unoptimized media components and distilled water and prw supplemented with optimized media components respectively from both the profiles it can be observed that degradation of flu in distilled water was higher towards the end of the study i e 14 days flu degradation was 20 11 and 35 14 after 14 days when raw prw was supplemented with unoptimized and optimized media components respectively in the absence of prw i e in distilled water 52 10 flu was degraded after 14 days in presence of the optimized media thus there was a significant reduction in flu degradation when prw was used as the matrix supplemented with optimized media components fig 3 c and d represents the degradation profiles of dbt 100 mg l by acclimatized p aeruginosa rs1 in presence of raw prw supplemented with unoptimized media components and distilled water and prw supplemented with optimized media components respectively from both the profiles it can be observed that degradation of dbt in distilled water was higher towards the end of the study i e 14 days dbt degradation was 24 10 and 32 13 after 14 days incubation when the raw prw was supplemented with unoptimized and optimized media components respectively on the other hand 47 3 dbt was degraded after 14 days incubation when its degradation was carried out in presence of optimized media prepared in distilled water i e in absence of prw thus a significant reduction in dbt degradation was observed in the prw matrix compared to that observed in distilled water supplemented with optimized media components these studies indicate the important role of the inorganic nutrients in facilitating biodegradation of the compounds both the unoptimized and optimized media were devoid of organic carbon that could serve as carbon source however the prw contained organics as indicated by its bod and cod values as shown in table 1 without any supplementation of nutrients cbz degradation was very low while supplementation of nutrients as per the optimized media further enhanced the degradation of cbz compared to the unoptimized media when compared to the corresponding optimized and unoptimized media in distilled water degradation in prw was significantly lower in case of both flu and dbt degradation was inhibited in prw supplemented with unoptimized and optimized media components compared to that observed in the optimized media prepared in distilled water possibly readily degradable substances present in prw were preferentially degraded such that degradation of the target compounds was lower biodegradation or transformation of other aromatics and heterocyclics may have also caused some hindrance in degradation of the spiked compounds hence it can be concluded that adding this bacterial strain can facilitate treatment of real refinery wastewater provided necessary inorganic nutrients are also supplemented this study also highlights the significant advantage that can be achieved by optimizing the nutrient formulation before attempting biological treatment with bioaugmentation the approach followed for media optimization involved plackett burman design method of steepest ascent and central composite design using response surface methodology as described by ghosh and mukherji 17 3 2 2 mixture biodegradation studies for cbz flu and dbt in presence of petroleum refinery wastewater supplemented with optimized media components degradation profiles of mixtures of cbz flu and dbt at 30 mg l and 300 mg l total initial concentration in prw are shown in fig 4 a and b respectively when the substrates were applied in mixture at 30 mg l total concentration 62 3 64 4 and 48 3 degradation was observed after 14 days incubation for cbz flu and dbt respectively it can be observed that degradation of dbt was significantly less compared to cbz and flu these results indicate possible interaction among the substrates that may be present at environmentally relevant concentration levels when each substrate was applied in mixture at 300 mg l total concentration 28 3 38 6 and 34 2 degradation was observed after 14 days incubation for cbz flu and dbt respectively it can be observed that at higher concentration degradation of all the substrates were significantly inhibited table 2 summarizes the mbr maximum biodegradation rate values of various substrates during their degradation individually and in mixtures in prw mbr was calculated from the degradation data of each of the substrates applied individually and in mixtures applying eq 1 1 m b r s 1 s 2 where s1 is the slope of the abiotic decay profile mg substrate l 1 day 1 and s2 is the slope of the biotic decay profile mg substrate l 1 day 1 it can be observed that the optimized media significantly improved mbr values of all the substrates when they were applied as the sole source of carbon and energy in presence of prw in case of mixture degradation higher mbr value was observed for flu in both the mixtures the n p ratio in prw prw unoptimized media and prw optimized media systems were 1452 1 1 7 1 and 0 12 1 respectively and the corresponding tds values were 100 14 2258 111 and 23 903 537 mg l respectively on the other hand the cod n p ratio in prw prw unoptimized media and prw optimized media systems were 4125 1413 1 1 75 1 73 1 and 0 09 0 12 1 respectively 3 2 3 biodegradation of various aromatics and heterocyclic pahs in petroleum refinery wastewater out of the nine compounds detected using the 4d gc gc tofms pyridine and 1h phenalene could not be detected in most of the samples although they were present in the controls hence they were excluded from the compound matrix for determining area reduction after biodegradation fig 5 a illustrates relative area of the compounds in the controls and samples for 1 methylene 1h indene 1m1hi acenaphthene ace and tetrahydrothiophene 1 1 dioxide thtd maximum area reduction was observed using dibenzothiophene acclimatized culture maximum area reduction of dibutyl phthalate dp and 1 3 dioxolane dx was observed using the mixture acclimatized culture maximum area reduction of biphenyl bp and acenaphthylene acy was obtained using carbazole and fluorene acclimatized cultures respectively hence it can be concluded that p aeruginosa rs1 has potential to degrade some of the aromatics and heterocyclics in prw when it is acclimatized to specific substrates or a mixture of substrates significant toc removal was achieved in all the cases fig 5b however maximum toc removal 39 2 was achieved when the mixture acclimatized culture was used as inoculum least toc removal was observed when the flu acclimatized culture was used as inoculum popescu et al 7 monitored concentration of various organic compounds including pahs and heterocyclics in wastewater streams effluent and natural receptor sea of an oil refinery situated on the black sea shore in romania fluorene was present at 0 433 mg l and 1 247 mg l in waste streams generated from catalytic cracking unit and coke plant respectively fluorene concentration was very less 0 01 mg l in refinery effluent and in the natural receptor near the refinery heterocyclics such as benzothiophene and dibenzothiophene were detected in the wastewater stream generated from the catalytic cracking unit sulfur heterocyclics such as 3 methylthiophene tetrahydrothiophene and 2 ethylthiophene and nitrogen heterocyclics such as pyridine and its derivatives were identified the effluent stream from the refinery had nitrogen heterocyclics such as pyridine quinoline indole acridine and their derivatives and carbazole however these compounds could not be detected in the prw used in the current study joshi et al 6 evaluated the performance of a bench scale sequential anaerobic aerobic bioreactor for treating coking wastewater collected from the equalization tank of a coking facility in china the anaerobic bioreactor comprised of an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor and the aerobic bioreactor comprised of a conventional aerobic reactor from gc gc tofms analysis of the influent wastewater phenol methyl and dimethyl phenols aniline and various nitrogen heterocyclics such as quinoline isoquinoline indole benzimidazole and carbazole were detected various parameters such as cod toc total phenol total nitrogen ammonia nitrogen and sulfate and degradation of the compounds were monitored both in the anaerobic reactor and the combined anaerobic aerobic reactor separately over a period of 300 days toc reduction of 34 2 initial toc of 970 mg l was observed in the anaerobic reactor whereas 85 6 toc reduction was observed in the combined system after 300 days in the anaerobic bioreactor 0 84 6 removal of the compounds was achieved however the compounds were almost completely removed in the combined anaerobic aerobic system in the current study for initial toc concentration 307 11 mg l maximum removal of 39 2 was achieved after 14 days incubation however the compounds identified from the gc gc tofms analysis did not match with those reported in the study conducted by joshi et al 6 and hence removal of individual compounds cannot be directly compared across the studies among the compounds identified in the prw acenaphthene has been reported to be degraded by pseudomonas sp 25 in mixture along with naphthalene fluorene anthracene and pyrene however the degradation efficiency was low pseudomonas aeruginosa has been reported to efficiently degrade acenaphthylene 26 biphenyl 27 and acenaphthene 28 hatamian zarmi et al 29 reported that a pseudomonas aeruginosa strain capable of efficiently degrading biphenyl could also grow on pahs naphthalene phenanthrene and pyrene and one nitrogen heterocyclic pah cbz biphenyl is also an intermediate produced during aerobic degradation of dbt by several species of rhodococcus 30 31 a pseudomonas species 32 has been reported to degrade the endocrine disrupting substance dibutyl phthalate overall it can be observed that pseudomonas aeruginosa strains have versatile ability for degrading most of the contaminants present in prw which is also observed in the present study impact of acclimatizing the bacterial strain to various substrates also had significant influence on degradation of specific compounds present in the prw various researchers have reported improvement in biodegradation of pahs 33 pharmaceuticals and personal care products 34 when the bacterial culture was pre exposed to the tested compounds 4 conclusions the studies indicate the importance of the necessary minerals for biological treatment of prw and acclimatization of the bacterial culture to specific substrates for enhancing the degradation of cbz flu dbt and their mixtures various aromatics and heterocyclics present in the prw could be degraded and moderate toc removal was also achieved however application of the bacterial strain may not be a feasible strategy when the compounds are present at high concentrations more than 100 mg l or so the bacterial strain p aeruginosa rs1 can be considered as a potent degrader of the compounds when favourable conditions are provided declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

and wood preservative wastewater and in leachates from municipal landfills at 0 5 12 5 mg l 0 0002 6 8 mg l and 0 00001 10 8 mg l respectively 5 11 flu has been reported to be mostly associated with sewage sludge at concentrations varying from 0 77 to 11 94 μg kg 12 presence of dibenzothiophene and its alkylated analogues have been reported in lake sediments contaminated with refinery wastewater 13 14 prw often contain various pahs and heterocyclic pahs which are toxic mutagenic and sometimes carcinogenic to various organisms and human beings cbz flu and dbt which are representative compounds of the nitrogen and sulfur heterocyclic pahs and pahs containing three fused aromatic rings have been reported to be present in coking wastewater and prw at 7 8 12 5 mg l 12 5 125 mg l and 0 18 μg l to less than 0 02 mg l concentration respectively 7 8 15 16 the current study focusses on the feasibility of applying a bacterial strain pseudomonas aeruginosa rs1 for degradation of cbz dbt and flu in presence of raw prw the bacterial strain gene bank accession number kf751345 was isolated from oily sludge collected from an oil refinery mumbai india and was reported to efficiently degrade the nitrogen heterocyclic pah carbazole 17 and a four ring pah pyrene 18 it also grew well on oil extracted from oily sludge 19 ghosh and mukherji 35 reported the kinetics of cbz utilization by this strain when cbz was provided as sole substrate in an optimized mineral media raw prw was collected and was characterized based on some physicochemical parameters such as ph bod3 27 c and cod various aromatics and heterocyclic pahs in the prw were identified using gc gc tofms the first objective was to investigate the impact of adding various media components on the degradation of cbz flu and dbt each applied at 100 mg l in raw prw by p aeruginosa rs1 two sets of mixture cbz flu and dbt applied together degradation experiments were also conducted at two different initial concentration total applied concentration of 30 mg l 10 mg l of each substrate and 300 mg l 100 mg l of each substrate in order to understand substrate interaction effects at high and low substrate concentration the second objective was to check whether the bacterial strain could degrade various aromatics and heterocyclic pahs present in the prw the bacterial strain acclimatized to cbz flu dbt and their ternary mixture was tested for its capability to degrade various aromatics and heterocyclics present in the raw prw the compounds were selected based on the results obtained from gc gc tofms analyses 2

desired substrate or substrate mixture was used as the inoculum for conducting the degradation experiments in the presence of prw supplemented with various media components initially the bacterial cells were grown in nutrient broth and the cells were harvested by centrifugation 8000 rpm for 10 min followed by washing with 2 phosphate buffer solution pbs and finally adjusting the absorbance od600 to approximately 1 8 the od adjusted culture 3 v v was used as the inoculum for acclimatizing the cells to various substrates the culture was separately acclimatized to 250 mg l of cbz flu and dbt before conducting the degradation studies with cbz flu and dbt as substrate respectively the mixture degradation experiment was conducted using an inoculum acclimatized to a mixture of these compounds 50 mg l of each compound acclimatization was carried out by growing the bacterial strain on the individual substrates and their mixtures and through multiple subculturing of the bacterial cells conducted in a shaking incubator at 37 c and 120 rpm the subculturing technique is discussed in detail elsewhere 17 after acclimatization the bacterial cells were harvested by centrifuging at 12 000 rpm for 10 min and the cell pellet was resuspended in 2 pbs the cells were washed four times using 2 pbs and finally the od600 of the cell suspension was adjusted to 1 this was used as the inoculum in each experiment 2 3 preparation of stock solution of cbz flu and dbt stock solutions of cbz flu and dbt 10 g l were prepared by dissolving solid crystals of the compounds in dichloromethane the solution was subsequently filter sterilized through a 0 2 μm membrane filter the stock solution of each compound was freshly prepared before conducting each experiment screw capped erlenmeyer flasks were sterilized and the required amount of each stock was aseptically added to each flask and the flasks were kept inside the laminar flow hood overnight for evaporating dcm completely subsequently the optimized mineral media 17 was added to the flasks and the contents were sonicated for dispersing the crystals of the compounds in the aqueous phase 2 4 preparation of

limit of quantitation loq of cbz flu and dbt are lod loq in mg l 1 19 3 61 0 67 2 02 and 1 39 4 20 respectively 2 6 characterization of petroleum refinery wastewater the wastewater was first characterized by measuring its ph tss vss nh4 n po4 3 p bod and cod 24 for bod analysis greywater collected from an equalization tank in a hostel in iit bombay campus mumbai india was used as inoculum the composition of the prw was analysed using a pegasus 4d gc gc tofms combination of rxi 5 ms 30 m primary column and rxi 17sil ms 2 m secondary column both restek made in usa was used in 2d mode for identification of various compounds present in the wastewater the prw 50 ml was extracted with 25 ml of dichloromethane dcm extraction ratio 4 1 of dcm prw v v and two serial extractions and the

petroleum refinery wastewater in order to understand the biodegradability of cbz in presence of prw one set of experiment was set up in which the wastewater 100 was used directly without supplementing any of the salts present in the mineral media cbz 100 mg l was externally applied as carbon source and cbz acclimatized p aeruginosa rs1 was used as inoculum the batch degradation study was set up by adding 50 ml of the wastewater to each flask after adding using the method discussed in section 2 3 cbz 100 mg l as the external carbon source the flasks were sonicated to uniformly disperse the cbz crystals in wastewater the cbz acclimatized bacterial inoculum 3 v v was added to each of the flasks in two other studies 50 ml of the wastewater 100 supplemented with minerals as per the unoptimized and optimized media as mentioned in section 2 4 were used for conducting cbz degradation experiments with initial cbz concentration 100 mg l cbz acclimatized p aeruginosa rs1 was used as the inoculum another two sets of experiments were conducted in which biodegradability of flu and dbt with initial concentration 100 mg l each were investigated using prw supplemented with unoptimized and optimized media components flu and dbt acclimatized cells of p aeruginosa rs1 were used as inoculum for conducting degradation experiments on flu and dbt respectively the objective was to investigate whether the bacterial culture could efficiently degrade these compounds in presence of prwwhich is likely to contain various organic and inorganic constituents two sets of mixture degradation experiments cbz flu and dbt applied together were also conducted at two different initial concentration levels total applied concentrations of 30 mg l containing 10 mg l of each substrate and 300 mg l containing 100 mg l of each substrate p aeruginosa rs1 acclimatized to a mixture of cbz flu and dbt containing 50 mg l of each compound was used as inoculum for conducting both the experiments in presence of prw supplemented with optimized media components the main objective of these experiments was to understand substrate interaction effects at their low 30 mg l mixture and high 300 mg l mixture concentration levels the degradation characteristics of the substrates at 30 mg l total concentration is representative of contaminated wastewater extraction and quantification protocols of cbz flu and dbt are discussed in section 2 5 2 8 biodegradation of various indigenous aromatics and heterocyclic pahs in petroleum refinery wastewater and toc removal by p aeruginosa rs1 biodegradation experiments for various compounds aromatics and heterocyclic pahs present in prw were conducted separately p aeruginosa rs1 was separately acclimatized to cbz 100 mg l flu 100 mg l dbt 100 mg l and a mixture of cbz flu and dbt containing 50 mg l of each compound before use as inoculum in batch flasks 3 v v the compounds were selected based on the results obtained from gc gc tofms analyses of the prw and their degradation was monitored over a period of 14 days 37 c and 120 rpm the method of extraction and the gc oven temperature program were same as discussed previously the peak area of various compounds aromatics and heterocyclic pahs in the gc gc tofms total ion chromatograms tic obtained from the samples containing prw and bacterial inoculum acclimatized to various substrates after incubating for 14 days were compared with those obtained from the controls containing no bacterial inoculum in order to comment on degradation potential of these compounds degradation experiments were also set up in prw using p aeruginosa rs1 acclimatized to cbz 250 mg l flu 250 mg l dbt 250 mg l and a mixture of cbz flu and dbt containing 50 mg l of each compound as inoculum the objective was to monitor variation of toc over 14 days incubation using a toc analyser toc vcsh shimadzu japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of petroleum refinery wastewater table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the prw used in the present study fig 1 illustrates the major aromatics and heterocyclics detected in the prw using 4d gc gc tofms along with their retention time and similarity with the nist library spectra the mass spectra of the compounds detected in the prw and the nist library spectra are included in electronic supplementary information esi 3 2 biodegradation studies in presence of petroleum refinery wastewater 3 2 1 biodegradation studies on cbz flu and dbt present individually fig 2 a c represents the degradation profiles of 100 mg l cbz by acclimatized p aeruginosa rs1 in presence of raw prw and raw prw and distilled water supplemented with unoptimized and optimized media components respectively when raw wastewater was used 27 12 6 cbz was degraded after incubation for 14 days when raw wastewater was supplemented with unoptimized and optimized media components 47 5 2 and 69 4 3 cbz was degraded after 14 days of incubation respectively for media components spiked in distilled water together with 100 mg l cbz and inoculum 54 2 6 and 83 1 1 cbz degradation was achieved after 14 days incubation in presence of unoptimized and optimized media respectively fig 3 a and b represents the degradation profiles of flu 100 mg l by acclimatized p aeruginosa rs1 in presence of raw prw supplemented with unoptimized media components and distilled water and prw supplemented with optimized media components respectively from both the profiles it can be observed that degradation of flu in distilled water was higher towards the end of the study i e 14 days flu degradation was 20 11 and 35 14 after 14 days when raw prw was supplemented with unoptimized and optimized media components respectively in the absence of prw i e in distilled water 52 10 flu was degraded after 14 days in presence of the optimized media thus there was a significant reduction in flu degradation when prw was used as the matrix supplemented with optimized media components fig 3 c and d represents the degradation profiles of dbt 100 mg l by acclimatized p aeruginosa rs1 in presence of raw prw supplemented with unoptimized media components and distilled water and prw supplemented with optimized media components respectively from both the profiles it can be observed that degradation of dbt in distilled water was higher towards the end of the study i e 14 days dbt degradation was 24 10 and 32 13 after 14 days incubation when the raw prw was supplemented with unoptimized and optimized media components respectively on the other hand 47 3 dbt was degraded after 14 days incubation when its degradation was carried out in presence of optimized media prepared in distilled water i e in absence of prw thus a significant reduction in dbt degradation was observed in the prw matrix compared to that observed in distilled water supplemented with optimized media components these studies indicate the important role of the inorganic nutrients in facilitating biodegradation of the compounds both the unoptimized and optimized media were devoid of organic carbon that could serve as carbon source however the prw contained organics as indicated by its bod and cod values as shown in table 1 without any supplementation of nutrients cbz degradation was very low while supplementation of nutrients as per the optimized media further enhanced the degradation of cbz compared to the unoptimized media when compared to the corresponding optimized and unoptimized media in distilled water degradation in prw was significantly lower in case of both flu and dbt degradation was inhibited in prw supplemented with unoptimized and optimized media components compared to that observed in the optimized media prepared in distilled water possibly readily degradable substances present in prw were preferentially degraded such that degradation of the target compounds was lower biodegradation or transformation of other aromatics and heterocyclics may have also caused some hindrance in degradation of the spiked compounds hence it can be concluded that adding this bacterial strain can facilitate treatment of real refinery wastewater provided necessary inorganic nutrients are also supplemented this study also highlights the significant advantage that can be achieved by optimizing the nutrient formulation before attempting biological treatment with bioaugmentation the approach followed for media optimization involved plackett burman design method of steepest ascent and central composite design using response surface methodology as described by ghosh and mukherji 17 3 2 2 mixture biodegradation studies for cbz flu and dbt in presence of petroleum refinery wastewater supplemented with optimized media components degradation profiles of mixtures of cbz flu and dbt at 30 mg l and 300 mg l total initial concentration in prw are shown in fig 4 a and b respectively when the substrates were applied in mixture at 30 mg l total concentration 62 3 64 4 and 48 3 degradation was observed after 14 days incubation for cbz flu and dbt respectively it can be observed that degradation of dbt was significantly less compared to cbz and flu these results indicate possible interaction among the substrates that may be present at environmentally relevant concentration levels when each substrate was applied in mixture at 300 mg l total concentration 28 3 38 6 and 34 2 degradation was observed after 14 days incubation for cbz flu and dbt respectively it can be observed that at higher concentration degradation of all the substrates were significantly inhibited table 2 summarizes the mbr maximum biodegradation rate values of various substrates during their degradation individually and in mixtures in prw mbr was calculated from the degradation data of each of the substrates applied individually and in mixtures applying eq 1 1 m b r s 1 s 2 where s1 is the slope of the abiotic decay profile mg substrate l 1 day 1 and s2 is the slope of the biotic decay profile mg substrate l 1 day 1 it can be observed that the optimized media significantly improved mbr values of all the substrates when they were applied as the sole source of carbon and energy in presence of prw in case of mixture degradation higher mbr value was observed for flu in both the mixtures the n p ratio in prw prw unoptimized media and prw optimized media systems were 1452 1 1 7 1 and 0 12 1 respectively and the corresponding tds values were 100 14 2258 111 and 23 903 537 mg l respectively on the other hand the cod n p ratio in prw prw unoptimized media and prw optimized media systems were 4125 1413 1 1 75 1 73 1 and 0 09 0 12 1 respectively 3 2 3 biodegradation of various aromatics and heterocyclic pahs in petroleum refinery wastewater out of the nine compounds detected using the 4d gc gc tofms pyridine and 1h phenalene could not be detected in most of the samples although they were present in the controls hence they were excluded from the compound matrix for determining area reduction after biodegradation fig 5 a illustrates relative area of the compounds in the controls and samples for 1 methylene 1h indene 1m1hi acenaphthene ace and tetrahydrothiophene 1 1 dioxide thtd maximum area reduction was observed using dibenzothiophene acclimatized culture maximum area reduction of dibutyl phthalate dp and 1 3 dioxolane dx was observed using the mixture acclimatized culture maximum area reduction of biphenyl bp and acenaphthylene acy was obtained using carbazole and fluorene acclimatized cultures respectively hence it can be concluded that p aeruginosa rs1 has potential to degrade some of the aromatics and heterocyclics in prw when it is acclimatized to specific substrates or a mixture of substrates significant toc removal was achieved in all the cases fig 5b however maximum toc removal 39 2 was achieved when the mixture acclimatized culture was used as inoculum least toc removal was observed when the flu acclimatized culture was used as inoculum popescu et al 7 monitored concentration of various organic compounds including pahs and heterocyclics in wastewater streams effluent and natural receptor sea of an oil refinery situated on the black sea shore in romania fluorene was present at 0 433 mg l and 1 247 mg l in waste streams generated from catalytic cracking unit and coke plant respectively fluorene concentration was very less 0 01 mg l in refinery effluent and in the natural receptor near the refinery heterocyclics such as benzothiophene and dibenzothiophene were detected in the wastewater stream generated from the catalytic cracking unit sulfur heterocyclics such as 3 methylthiophene tetrahydrothiophene and 2 ethylthiophene and nitrogen heterocyclics such as pyridine and its derivatives were identified the effluent stream from the refinery had nitrogen heterocyclics such as pyridine quinoline indole acridine and their derivatives and carbazole however these compounds could not be detected in the prw used in the current study joshi et al 6 evaluated the performance of a bench scale sequential anaerobic aerobic bioreactor for treating coking wastewater collected from the equalization tank of a coking facility in china the anaerobic bioreactor comprised of an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor and the aerobic bioreactor comprised of a conventional aerobic reactor from gc gc tofms analysis of the influent wastewater phenol methyl and dimethyl phenols aniline and various nitrogen heterocyclics such as quinoline isoquinoline indole benzimidazole and carbazole were detected various parameters such as cod toc total phenol total nitrogen ammonia nitrogen and sulfate and degradation of the compounds were monitored both in the anaerobic reactor and the combined anaerobic aerobic reactor separately over a period of 300 days toc reduction of 34 2 initial toc of 970 mg l was observed in the anaerobic reactor whereas 85 6 toc reduction was observed in the combined system after 300 days in the anaerobic bioreactor 0 84 6 removal of the compounds was achieved however the compounds were almost completely removed in the combined anaerobic aerobic system in the current study for initial toc concentration 307 11 mg l maximum removal of 39 2 was achieved after 14 days incubation however the compounds identified from the gc gc tofms analysis did not match with those reported in the study conducted by joshi et al 6 and hence removal of individual compounds cannot be directly compared across the studies among the compounds identified in the prw acenaphthene has been reported to be degraded by pseudomonas sp 25 in mixture along with naphthalene fluorene anthracene and pyrene however the degradation efficiency was low pseudomonas aeruginosa has been reported to efficiently degrade acenaphthylene 26 biphenyl 27 and acenaphthene 28 hatamian zarmi et al 29 reported that a pseudomonas aeruginosa strain capable of efficiently degrading biphenyl could also grow on pahs naphthalene phenanthrene and pyrene and one nitrogen heterocyclic pah cbz biphenyl is also an intermediate produced during aerobic degradation of dbt by several species of rhodococcus 30 31 a pseudomonas species 32 has been reported to degrade the endocrine disrupting substance dibutyl phthalate overall it can be observed that pseudomonas aeruginosa strains have versatile ability for degrading most of the contaminants present in prw which is also observed in the present study impact of acclimatizing the bacterial strain to various substrates also had significant influence on degradation of specific compounds present in the prw various researchers have reported improvement in biodegradation of pahs 33 pharmaceuticals and personal care products 34 when the bacterial culture was pre exposed to the tested compounds 4 conclusions the studies indicate the importance of the necessary minerals for biological treatment of prw and acclimatization of the bacterial culture to specific substrates for enhancing the degradation of cbz flu dbt and their mixtures various aromatics and heterocyclics present in the prw could be degraded and moderate toc removal was also achieved however application of the bacterial strain may not be a feasible strategy when the compounds are present at high concentrations more than 100 mg l or so the bacterial strain p aeruginosa rs1 can be considered as a potent degrader of the compounds when favourable conditions are provided declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

13903,to address the issues caused by the external addition of fe in the electro fenton reaction activated carbon catalysts loaded with fe were prepared by an impregnation method with which a novel fe activated carbon titanium mesh composite air cathode fe ac ti cathode was prepared the preparation conditions were investigated and determined in terms of chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiency of the nanofiltration concentrate of landfill leachate llc an electrochemical system constructed using the fe ac ti cathode and a dimensional stable anode dsa was developed to treat the llc the electrochemical reaction conditions were studied by single factor experiments and orthogonal array analysis the highest cod removal 97 06 was obtained at an applied voltage of 10 v initial ph of 7 and electrode distance of 1 cm the optimum conditions were applied voltage of 8 v initial ph of 3 and electrode distance of 3 cm for 61 24 total organic carbon removal bod5 cod ratios of all tests increased from 0 03 to between 0 23 and 0 51 the effluent after the reaction was either neutral or weakly alkaline neither hydrogen peroxide nor fe ions were added to the reaction system and almost no fe precipitation was produced the system realized the co treatment of cl containing wastewater by anodic electrocatalytic oxidation and cathode electro fenton in the same reactor we also address this common problem in the electro fenton reaction utilizing a simple low cost method with abundant source material keywords landfill leachate nanofiltration concentrate electrocatalysis oxidation electro fenton 1 introduction sanitary landfills remain the main disposal method for municipal solid waste msw worldwide 1 3 landfilling leads to leachate production with various inorganic salts and a high concentration of organic content 4 which may cause serious pollution to the surrounding environment if improperly disposed of most countries have strict requirements for the discharge of landfill leachate 5 6 various processes combined with pretreatment biochemical treatment and advanced treatment are adapted to deal with landfill leachate 7 9 membrane filtration technology is often used as an advanced treatment method for landfill leachate treatment because of its technology being well established relatively low cost and high quality membrane filtered effluent which is usually suitable for discharge into natural waters or recycling 10 however membrane filtration also produces leachate concentrate while producing a purified permeate in compliance with discharge standards the concentrate of landfill leachate llc especially nanofiltration concentrate has worse characteristics such as higher cod concentration more toxic or nontoxic salts and lower biodegradability because of membrane concentration 11 thus effective disposal methods for llc must be further studied and practiced over the past two decades electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops have received increasing attention in the treatment of high concentration organic saline wastewater the removal of organic pollutants mainly depends on direct electrochemical conversion i e the transformation of organic pollutants into harmless substances by anodic oxidation and indirect electrochemical conversion i e the conversion of pollutants to harmless substances by the oxidation reduction agents produced by electrochemical reactions 12 13 it is especially suitable for the use of eaops to deal with llc with high conductivity and chloride content 11 14 the conductivity of llc in the order of 104 to 105 μs cm 1 caused by concentrated ions can make the electrochemical reaction more energy efficient chloride is a characteristic pollutant in landfill leachate which is derived from salt in human diets normally in the order of 103 to 104 mg l 1 it can easily be converted into active cl including hypochlorite in the electrochemical reaction process which can degrade cod by indirect oxidation according to the difference in electrodes external agents reaction conditions and reaction mechanisms in electrochemical reaction systems eaops can be divided into many types that is anodic oxidation ao electro fenton ef and photo electro fenton pef 13 for the main reaction zone for removing organic pollutants some are close to the anode some close to the cathode as an ao anodic catalytic oxidation with a dimensionally stabilized anode dsa shows advantages in the process of degradation of organic pollutants in cl containing wastewater due to its high electrocatalytic activity dsa can produce hypochlorite ions from the oxidation of chloride ions to oxidize organic matter and has the characteristics of mechanical stability and anode corrosion resistance 15 16 the main reaction for removing pollutants occurs near the anode anode electrocatalysis has great potential in the treatment of llc ef with a carbon ptfe air diffusion electrode whose cathode areas served as the main organic removal zone can produce h2o2 in situ through cathode aeration this h2o2 and an external fe catalyst then react to produce o h degrading organic pollutants 17 ef has been widely applied in the study of treatment of various kinds of wastewater containing high concentrations of organic pollutants including landfill leachate 13 18 wang et al obtained a total organic carbon toc removal efficiency of 82 by ef treatment of concentrate generated in the nanofiltration of biologically pretreated landfill leachate 19 the common drawbacks of various efs with air cathodes are that the reaction requires an external dosage of fe salts in acidic solution low utilization ratio of fe and h2o2 and a large amount of fe sludge formed with the characteristics of llc in mind in this study it was treated by a combination of anodic catalytic oxidation and cathode ef to solve the above problems a novel heterogeneous catalytic fe activated carbon titanium air cathode fe ac ti cathode was developed independently the organic compounds in the llc could be degraded by the fenton reaction in the cathode region without adding any fe or h2o2 to a certain extent overcoming the common drawbacks of ef with air cathodes moreover anode electro catalysis and cathode ef were applied to the same electrochemical system the anodic reaction zone eqs 1 4 20 21 and the cathode reaction zone eqs 5 7 22 could be used to remove organic matter in the llc simultaneously h2o2 is electro generated from the two electron reduction of o2 at the fe ac ti cathode eq 5 o h is generated from fenton s reaction of h2o2 and fe2 eq 6 anodic electrocatalysis or cathodic ef combined with other methods for organic wastewater treatment have been extensively reported but usually in a combined process one after another 12 23 the simultaneous use of anode electro catalysis and cathode ef in the same electrochemical system has rarely been reported 24 26 this is its first application to treat llc with dsa

explored 2 materials and methods 2 1 llc samples electrodes and chemicals llc samples were obtained with plastic buckets from a local landfill which was put into operation in 1998 with a capacity of 1200 tons of msw per day the landfill leachate is treated by a combination of two stage a o aerobic anaerobic external membrane bioreactor treatment mbr nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro the llc was collected from the nf process with the main characteristics shown in table 1 a well operated a o process can usually achieve effective removal of ammonia nitrogen from landfill leachate 27 28 the concentration of ammonia nitrogen in the llc used in this experiment was not detected according to the determination result ti base and ruo2 iro2 coating mesh dsa were purchased from titanium nickel gold port equipment manufacturing co ltd activated carbon was a coconut shell activated carbon obtained from anshan city activated carbon factory polytetrafluorethylene ptfe and battery grade acetylene black were purchased from lizhiyuan battery ferrous sulfate and other chemicals were analytical reagents supplied by sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd 2 2 preparation of fe loaded active carbon catalyst first a suitable amount of activated carbon was bathed in 0 02 mol l 1 sodium hydroxide solution for 24 h then it was filtered and washed to neutral with deionized water second it was bathed in 0 02 mol l 1 nitric acid solution then it was filtered and washed to neutral with deionized water 29 finally the activated carbon was dried at 105 for further use the appropriate concentration of ferrous sulfate solution was prepared ferrous sulfate was loaded on the activated carbon by wet impregnation after acid alkali washing the fe loaded activated carbon was completely dried at 105 then it was calcined at a certain temperature to prepare the heterogeneous catalyst after which it was cooled to room temperature to prepare the electrode 2 3 preparation of composite cathode the container with fe loaded active carbon catalyst was placed in the ultrasonic reactor where an appropriate amount of anhydrous ethanol was added after 5 min of ultrasonic vibration appropriate acetylene black and ptfe were added after 15 min of ultrasonic vibration the container was placed on the heater to maintain the temperature at 80 the mixture was evenly heated by mechanical agitation and the anhydrous ethanol was gradually evaporated from the mixture which was then glued to form a paste the paste mixture was placed on a smooth glass surface and rolled into a thin sheet the sheet was cut into an appropriate size and attached to the titanium mesh which served as the electrode framework the sheet was stabilized by appropriate pressure with a presser thus completing the fe ac ti composite electrode activated carbon titanium mesh composite electrodes were prepared following the same procedure without fe loading 2 4 experimental setup and electrochemical treatment the experimental setup is composed of a dc power supply reactor electrodes and aerator an undivided plexiglass container 16 cm 10 cm 5 cm was used as the reactor the electrode voltage was controlled by the dc power supply sg1731sc3a wenkai power equipment co ltd the air is injected into the container close to the cathode by the aerator to ensure o2 saturation aeration also plays the role of agitation for the llc the effective immersion area of the electrode was 24 square centimeters 4 cm 6 cm with 400 ml of water per reaction at appropriate time intervals samples were taken for chemical analysis all samples were measured in duplicate except toc and the average value was used in our study 2 5 experimental process to investigate the effect of the fe content in the catalyst on the performance of the electrode five groups of contrast experiments were carried out with a dsa anode to determine the optimal amount of loaded ferrous ions one used a common activated carbon based titanium mesh composite electrode as the cathode and 0 06 mmol l 1 feso4 was added to the system the other four used fe ac ti composite electrodes as cathodes with loads of 0 25 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 ferrous ions separately the cod content was measured every 20 min and the cod removal rate was calculated the amount of fe loaded ptfe dosage calcination temperature and the ratio of catalyst and acetylene black are the main factors affecting the performance of the electrode the electrochemical systems constructed with dsa anodes and cathodes made under different conditions were used to treat llc respectively by investigating the treatment effect of the system on llc the optimum preparation conditions of the electrode were obtained the conditions of the electrochemical wastewater treatment experiment were as follows ph of 3 applied voltage of 8 v electrode distance of 6 cm and reaction time of 140 min the above conditions were determined on the basis of preliminary experiments the influence of four factors on cod removal of llc was studied through single factor experiment using the control variable method that is under the condition that the three factors were kept unchanged the influence of the fourth factor on cod removal rate was investigated the experiment sequence of the four factors was electrode distance applied voltage initial ph and reaction time and their optimal conditions were obtained in order the optimal values obtained in the previous experiments were used as the settled conditions for the subsequent experiments finally the optimal conditions of each single factor experiment were obtained based on the results of the single factor experiment the reasonable interval of each influencing factor was determined and an orthogonal experiment with four factors and three levels was designed to study the optimum conditions and treatment effect of the llc by the combined anode electrocatalysis and cathodic ef system all experiments were verified with a second experiment if the both results matched each other closely the values of the first experiment were realized to be valid and taken if the differences were large the experiment would be reconducted until reasonably repeated values were obtained 2 6 analytical method the surface morphology of the cathode was observed using sigma zeiss σigma hd field emission scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive spectroscopy eds was used to analyze the load and consumption of fe x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was used to analyze the surface components of the cathode an autosorb iq specific surface and pore size analyzer supplied by the conta instrument company was used for the specific surface and aperture measurements toc was measured using a toc analyzer supplied by sievers innovox general electric analytical instruments company cod was determined by the potassium dichromate method china national standard gb 11914 89 ammonia nitrogen was determined by the distillation and titration method china national standard gb t 7478 1987 the wastewater was diluted to near colorless with colorless water according to the appropriate dilution multiple the multiple of dilution times is used to describe the color of the wastewater china national standard gb t 11903 1989 bod5 was determined by the dilution and seeding method china national standard hj505 2009 3 results and discussions 3 1 influencing factors of cathode preparation and characterization the experimental results of study on influencing factors of cathode preparation are shown in fig 1 according to fig 1 a the removal rate of cod of the ef system with fe ac ti composite cathodes loaded 0 5 ferrous was the highest combined with the results of the specific surface area and pore volume analysis table 2 it was indicated that when the amount of fenton catalyst ferrous loaded on the electrode was relatively small the effect of the heterogeneous fenton treatment was limited due to the low fe concentration however when the amount of ferrous loading was too high the mesoporous of activated carbon which were the main sites of the catalyst was blocked leading to a decrease in the catalytic performance of the electrode catalysts loaded with 0 5 iron were prepared by the impregnation method the dried catalysts were calcined in a muffle furnace at 100 200 300 and 400 for 3 h the other conditions were as follows the mass ratio of catalyst to ptfe and acetylene black were both 20 1 and the pressure of sheet making was 10 mpa as shown in fig 1 b with an increase in calcination temperature the removal rate of cod first increased and then decreased the catalytic activity of the fe ac ti composite electrode was the highest after the catalyst was calcined at 300 the oxygen surface groups such as carboxylic acid carboxylic anhydride and esters could be produced on the surface of the activated carbon in the process of calcination when the calcination temperature is between 100 and 200 the ferrous sulfate in the activated carbon promotes its pyrolysis to produce carboxylic acid and carboxylic anhydride 30 when the calcination temperature was between 200 c and 300 c the amounts of carboxylic acid and carboxylic anhydride decreased and the amount of lactone increased with increasing calcination temperature which made the ferrous sulfate disperse more evenly on the surface of the catalyst furthermore the activity of the catalyst increased and the decomposition rate of h2o2 also increased when the calcination temperature was higher than 400 c the lactone formed on the surface of activated carbon pyrolyzed resulting in poor dispersion of ferrous sulfate and low catalyst activity 31 therefore the final calcination temperature was set to 300 c when the mass ratio of catalyst to ptfe was 20 1 the ratio of catalyst to acetylene black was adjusted to 40 1 20 1 15 1 and 10 1 it was found that when the mass ratio was less than 15 1 slight cracks appeared in the electrode sheet made by the rolling method and when the mass ratio was less than 10 1 the electrode could not be prepared but when there was no acetylene black the stability of the electrode was reduced and the electrode was often damaged after ef treatment as can be seen from fig 1 c the cod removal rate of the electrode with a mass ratio of 40 1 was higher than the other two in the first 40 min then the growth rate slowed down and the final removal effect was lower than that of the other two when the mass ratio decreased to 20 1 and 15 1 the treatment effect of the llc was improved with an increase in the acetylene black content considering that the cost of acetylene black is far greater than activated carbon and the stability of the 15 1 electrode was limited the mass ratio of the catalyst to acetylene black was determined to be 20 1 the mass ratio of catalyst to ptfe was adjusted to 1 1 2 1 5 1 7 5 1 10 1 15 1 20 1 25 1 and 30 1 respectively the ptfe film coated on the catalyst surface transformed and contracted when ptfe reached its melting point at 330 more gas diffusion channels would form there to provide more active sites for the gas liquid reaction and enhance the cathodic catalytic activity 32 therefore the electrodes in different ratios of catalysts to ptfe were calcined at 330 for 3 h in a muffle furnace the effect of the treatment for llc before and after calcination was investigated when the mass ratio of catalyst to ptfe was greater than 20 1 the electrode sheet was unstable and tended to be damaged moreover when the mass ratio was 15 1 and 20 1 the structure of the electrode was destroyed after calcination because the binder component was too small black and red columns represent the removal rate of cod before and after calcining respectively in fig 1 d calcination process could obviously enhance the catalytic activity of the electrodes as well as the electric fenton treatment however the removal rate of cod decreased with an increased amount of ptfe because ptfe blocked the micro and mesopores of the activated carbon during the electrode preparation and hindered the loaded ferrous from participating in the fenton reaction considering the stability of the electrode and the removal effect of cod the mass ratio of catalyst to ptfe was determined to be 20 1 without high temperature calcination it is necessary to make electrodes by pressing an electrode sheet on a titanium mesh pressure determines the bonding effect of the electrode catalytic layer with titanium mesh thus affecting the catalytic activity and service life of the electrode when the pressure was 9 mpa and 10 mpa the removal effect of cod was almost the same considering that when the electrode pressed at 10 mpa the electrode was more stable the ideal pressure was determined to be 10 mpa sem eds shows that fe was present in the electrodes before and after the reaction as shown in fig a1 after the electrode was used it adsorbed a small amount of mg cl na c o and s elements in the llc fig a1 b in which the c and o elements are also elements contained in the activated carbon itself according to the analysis the impregnation method could effectively load the fe on the surface and in the activated carbon to form a heterogeneous fenton catalyst the fe ac ti composite electrode effectively suppressed the dissolution of fe ions the elemental composition and chemical states of the fe ac ti composite electrode were further studied by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps as shown in fig 2 before and after the reaction which further proves the above analysis the specific surface area and pore volume of the various fe loaded activated carbon and air cathode were measured the specific surface area was calculated using the bet equation the specific surface area and pore volume of the meso and microporous samples were calculated using the bjh and t plot models the results are summarized in table 2 it shows that the specific surface area and pore volume of activated carbon decreased after ferrous loading the specific surface area and pore volume of the mesoporous decreased significantly with an increase in the amount of fe loaded it was inferred that ferrous ions mainly existed in the mesopores of activated carbon when the catalysts were prepared by the impregnation method when the fe loading reached 1 of the mass of activated carbon the mesopores of activated carbon were basically blocked and the specific surface area and pore volume of the mesopores were much smaller the pores were partially blocked after the conductive agent and adhesives were added 3 2 influencing factors of llc treatment the electrochemical system constructed using the fe ac ti cathode and dsa anode was used to treat llc the effect of influencing factors are shown in fig 3 fig 3 a shows that the removal rate of cod in llc increased with a decrease in the electrode distance the maximum cod removal rate was reached when the electrode distance was 1 cm this was mainly because when applied voltage is constant the larger the electrode distance the smaller the current density which is not conducive to the production of o h and reactive cl and the regeneration of ferrous ions thus the smaller current density reduced the removal efficiency of cod in principle when the electrode distance is shorter the cod removal rate will further increase however if the electrode distance is less than 1 cm the distance between the electrode plates is difficult to control in practice the experiment will fail due to a possible short circuit of the system therefore 1 cm was decided as the optimal electrode distance as shown in fig 3 b the removal rate of cod increased with an increase in the applied voltage when it was less than 9 v when the voltage was 9 v the removal rate reached a maximum of 68 18 when the voltage was greater than 9 v the removal rate of cod decreased with an increase in voltage this can be ascribed to the fact that with the increase in applied voltage the current intensity increased the ions migrated faster the regeneration rate of ferrous ions and the production rate of o h increased promoting the electrochemical reaction however when the applied voltage was too high the excessive current density caused the hydrogen evolution reaction on the cathode material surface via eq 8 the reduction of the current utilization rate of the system hindered the regenerating reaction of ferrous ions which was counted against the generation of o h in addition as the voltage increased the energy consumption and running cost increased 8 2h2o 2e h2 2oh according to fig 3 c anodic electrocatalysis combined with cathodic ef had a wider ph effective range than the classical ef process when the ph value was between 2 and 6 the system had a better cod removal effect and smaller fluctuation with ph values when the ph value rose to or higher than 7 such as to 8 63 the initial ph value of raw llc cod removal efficiency decreased significantly but still reached 60 20 ph 7 and 54 28 ph 8 63 in the conventional ef process the treatment effect of the fenton reaction fluctuates greatly with the ph value of the solution when the initial ph of the solution is too low h2o2 traps protons to form electrophilic h3o2 which inhibits the fenton reaction when the ph value of the solution was higher than 4 0 the production efficiency of h2o2 decreased and fe2 was easily oxidized to fe3 to form ferric hydroxide precipitation which hindered the fenton reaction therefore the optimum ph range of the ef reaction solution is generally 2 8 3 5 22 33 it was believed through the preliminary analysis that the electrocatalytic reaction of the anode enlarged the applicable range of the ph value of the system this result is of great significance to the industrial application of anodic electrocatalysis and the cathodic ef process in treating llc a wider ph interval meant a reduction in the acid dosage and reaction cost before the fenton process according to fig 3 d the removal rate of cod increased with the reaction time the value of cod was reduced from 1418 24 mg l 1 to 110 8 mg l 1 in 280 min with a cod removal rate of 92 19 after 320 min it continued to decrease to 44 32 mg l 1 with the removal rate reaching 96 88 considering that the energy consumption of the system increased with the extension of the treatment time after 320 min and the improvement of the cod treatment effect was limited the optimal reaction time of the system was determined to be 320 min in order to further analyze the contribution of anodic electrocatalysis to the removal of cod of the concentrated solution the ph value and the concentrations of cl and clo with the reaction time under the optimal conditions obtained by single factor experiments were investigated and are shown in fig 4 the hypochlorite ions produced by the anode electrocatalytic reaction gradually increased the ph of the solution to weak alkaline via eq 9 the formation of hypochlorite was inhibited by acidic conditions in the first 40 min during this period the concentration of hypochlorite was lower and the cod decomposed rapidly it was presumed that the degradation of cod in the first 40 min 46 15 removal rate mainly depended on the cathodic ef reaction and anodic electrochemical oxidation and anodic production of o h played a minor role the ph of llc rose to weak alkalinity after 40 min of reaction the formation rate of hypochlorite was accelerated and the concentration of hypochlorite in the solution was higher when the reaction lasted for 40 80 min when the reaction lasted for 80 240 min the concentration of hypochlorite in the system tended to stability it was presumed that anodic electrochemical oxidation and hypochlorite produced by the anode electrocatalytic process played an important role in the degradation of cod with cathodic ef playing a certain role after 240 min hypochlorite ions accumulated with a decrease in cod concentration the degradation of cod mainly depended on anodic electrochemical oxidation and hypochlorite of course actual reactions in the system rich in h2o2 and chloride ions might be much more complicated 34 9 clo h2o hclo oh the extremely high color of llc is one of the major problems in treatment anode electrocatalytic oxidation combined with the cathode ef method can effectively degrade the color of llc the effect of color treatment is shown in fig 5 a the color of the llc was decreased to one from 980 times that of the original wastewater after 80 min of reaction later as the reaction time increased the color of the water sample gradually darkened it is plausible that a high concentration of hypochlorite ions turned the solution pale yellow in order to verify the hypothesis that the presence of high concentrations of hypochlorite led to the color deepening with the increase in treatment time the experiment compared the pale yellow water samples taken at 320 min before and after removing hypochlorite as shown in fig 5 b the results of the experiment confirmed this hypothesis in fact disinfectants need to be sprayed in an msw landfill to sanitize it the effluent from an electrochemical system containing hypochlorite can operate as a suitable disinfectant 3 3 orthogonal experiment according to the single factor experiment results the reasonable value range of each factor in the orthogonal experiment was determined according to fig 3 d the removal rate of cod increased with the increase of reaction time the value of cod was reduced to 110 8 mg l 1 in 280 min after 320 min it continued to decrease to 44 32 mg l 1 the concentration of cod was close to the emission standard 100 mg l 1 when the experiment processed for 280 min and it was too low when the it processed for 320 min considering that the best treatment effect obtained by the orthogonal experiment must be better than the single factor experiment 320 min would not be a good option to be used for the investigation and determination of the influence of various factors in the orthogonal experiment therefore 280 min was determined to use for the subsequent orthogonal experiment in the experiment the removal rates of cod and toc were used as the research object and the improvement of bod5 cod ratios b c were also investigated the design and results of the orthogonal experiment are shown in table 3 range analysis of cod and toc are listed in tables 4 and 5 k i j represents the sum of the removal rate of the i level in column j in k i j represents the average removal rate of the i level in column j via k i j 1 3 k i j r denotes the range of k1 k2 and k3 of column j via r j m a x k 1 j k 2 j k 3 j m i n k 1 j k 2 j k 3 j according to the orthogonal experiment theory the optimum condition of each factor as well as the optimal combination of factors can be determined by judging the averages k i j 35 36 the larger the average the better the experimental conditions the range values reflect an individual factor s effect on the removal rates the range analysis of cod removal indicate that cod removal was influenced by the following factors in descending order electrode distance cm initial ph interaction between electrode distance and applied voltage applied voltage v according to the orthogonal experiment results the optimal level of cod removal was a1b3c3 that is electrode distance of 1 cm applied voltage of 10 v and initial solution ph of 7 the optimum cod removal rate was 97 06 the range analysis of toc indicated that the toc removal was influenced by the following factors in descending order applied voltage v initial ph interaction between electrode distance and applied voltage electrode distance cm the optimal level of toc removal was electrode distance of 3 cm applied voltage of 8 v and initial solution ph of 3 because the optimum treatment conditions were not in the orthogonal experiment table verification experiments in the optimum treatment conditions were carried out the results show that the concentration of toc was reduced from 547 mg l 1 to 212 mg l 1 with a removal rate of 61 24 by anodic electrocatalysis and cathodic electro fenton treatment over 280 min it can be seen from table 3 that anodic electrocatalysis combined with the cathodic ef method also had a strong effect on b c elevation and the b c ratios of all tests increased from 0 03 to between 0 23 and 0 51 increasing the biodegradability of llc when the cod removal efficiency was the highest cod concentrate was 44 48 mg l 1 because it could be discharged directly at this level it is of no practical significance to investigate the biodegradability therefore the bod5 value was not measured and the b c ratio was not calculated comparing optimal conditions for cod and toc removal obtained from the orthogonal experiments the initial ph varied largely and the decrease in cod was not linearly related to the removal of toc which represents the degree of mineralization acidic conditions were more conducive to mineralization of organic matter while neutral conditions had a higher removal rate of oxygen consuming substances in the vicinity of ph 3 which was more conducive to the fenton reaction the cathodic ef effect of the system dominated and oxidized organic compounds by o h which had a higher redox potential the optimum cod removal rate obtained by the orthogonal experiment was 97 06 which was greater than the 92 19 at 280 min under the optimum conditions obtained by the single factor experiment the results showed that the optimum initial solution ph was 7 which differed greatly from the optimum ph of the ef reaction between 2 8 3 5 this indicated that anodic electrocatalysis and the interaction of various factors had a large impact on the reaction the variation of hypochlorite concentration with time was investigated and compared under the optimum conditions obtained by single factor and orthogonal experiment respectively the specific results are shown in fig 6 the black curve represents the change in hypochlorite concentration with time under the optimum conditions of the orthogonal experiment and the red curve is the change in hypochlorite concentration with time under the optimum condition of the single factor experiment it can be seen that the initial ph of 7 inhibited the occurrence of anodic production of o h and the cathodic fenton reaction to a certain extent but greatly increased the rate of hypochlorite formation thus the overall cod removal efficiency was better in addition in the single factor test curve the hypochlorite concentration continued to increase while in the orthogonal test curve there was a significant fluctuation of the hypochlorite concentration in the last stage obviously the increase of the initial ph accelerates the reaction rate eqs 2 and 3 which was beneficial to the faster accumulation of hypochlorite therefore the hypochlorite concentration in the orthogonal test curve was higher than that in the single factor test curve if reaction time was the same and it reached the maximum at 150 min there after when the consumption of hypochlorite organics ocl intermediates co2 cl h2o 37 was more than the production the concentration would decrease on the contrary it would rise to investigate whether the cathodic ef reaction contributed to the degradation of cod titanium mesh was used as the cathodic reaction for 280 min under the same conditions the cod of the effluent was 328 08 mg l 1 which was much higher than the 77 84 mg l 1 obtained in the original system with the fe ac ti composite electrode therefore it was convinced that the ef reaction still took place at a ph of 7 which played an important role in the degradation of cod in the whole system the reaction process of cl containing and complex component llc in the co existing system of electrocatalysis and ef was more complicated 34 the specific reaction mechanism is not included in the scope of this study it should be noted that the limits of discharge concentration of water pollutants from municipal solid waste landfills is stipulated in the standard for pollution control on the landfill site of municipal solid waste gb 16889 2008 china but there is no requirement for toc concentration the main pollution indicators of llc after treatment with ef met the discharge standards of china for landfill leachate cod 100 mg l 1 and color 40 times 4 conclusion a novel heterogeneous catalytic cathode iron activated carbon titanium air cathode was successfully developed and used to treat llc the electrochemical system constructed with a dsa and a self developed cathode could effectively degrade cod toc and color in the llc by the synergistic effect of anodic electrocatalysis and cathodic ef and significantly improve its biodegradability through single factor and orthogonal experiments the optimum treatment conditions for llc by the synergistic effect of electrocatalysis and ef were obtained under these conditions the cod concentration of llc decreased from 1512 32 mg l 1 to 44 48 mg l 1 with a removal rate as high as 97 06 moreover the electrochemical system without adding any h2o2 or ferrous ions has a much larger ph range than the classical ef method after the reaction the effluent was neutral or weakly alkaline which greatly reduced the amount of reagent needed to adjust the ph before and after the reaction thus reducing operation cost declaration of competing interest the authors

13903,to address the issues caused by the external addition of fe in the electro fenton reaction activated carbon catalysts loaded with fe were prepared by an impregnation method with which a novel fe activated carbon titanium mesh composite air cathode fe ac ti cathode was prepared the preparation conditions were investigated and determined in terms of chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiency of the nanofiltration concentrate of landfill leachate llc an electrochemical system constructed using the fe ac ti cathode and a dimensional stable anode dsa was developed to treat the llc the electrochemical reaction conditions were studied by single factor experiments and orthogonal array analysis the highest cod removal 97 06 was obtained at an applied voltage of 10 v initial ph of 7 and electrode distance of 1 cm the optimum conditions were applied voltage of 8 v initial ph of 3 and electrode distance of 3 cm for 61 24 total organic carbon removal bod5 cod ratios of all tests increased from 0 03 to between 0 23 and 0 51 the effluent after the reaction was either neutral or weakly alkaline neither hydrogen peroxide nor fe ions were added to the reaction system and almost no fe precipitation was produced the system realized the co treatment of cl containing wastewater by anodic electrocatalytic oxidation and cathode electro fenton in the same reactor we also address this common problem in the electro fenton reaction utilizing a simple low cost method with abundant source material keywords landfill leachate nanofiltration concentrate electrocatalysis oxidation electro fenton 1 introduction sanitary landfills remain the main disposal method for municipal solid waste msw worldwide 1 3 landfilling leads to leachate production with various inorganic salts and a high concentration of organic content 4 which may cause serious pollution to the surrounding environment if improperly disposed of most countries have strict requirements for the discharge of landfill leachate 5 6 various processes combined with pretreatment biochemical treatment and advanced treatment are adapted to deal with landfill leachate 7 9 membrane filtration technology is often used as an advanced treatment method for landfill leachate treatment because of its technology being well established relatively low cost and high quality membrane filtered effluent which is usually suitable for discharge into natural waters or recycling 10 however membrane filtration also produces leachate concentrate while producing a purified permeate in compliance with discharge standards the concentrate of landfill leachate llc especially nanofiltration concentrate has worse characteristics such as higher cod concentration more toxic or nontoxic salts and lower biodegradability because of membrane concentration 11 thus effective disposal methods for llc must be further studied and practiced over the past two decades electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops have received increasing attention in the treatment of high concentration organic saline wastewater the removal of organic pollutants mainly depends on direct electrochemical conversion i e the transformation of organic pollutants into harmless substances by anodic oxidation and indirect electrochemical conversion i e the conversion of pollutants to harmless substances by the oxidation reduction agents produced by electrochemical reactions 12 13 it is especially suitable for the use of eaops to deal with llc with high conductivity and chloride content 11 14 the conductivity of llc in the order of 104 to 105 μs cm 1 caused by concentrated ions can make the electrochemical reaction more energy efficient chloride is a characteristic pollutant in landfill leachate which is derived from salt in human diets normally in the order of 103 to 104 mg l 1 it can easily be converted into active cl including hypochlorite in the electrochemical reaction process which can degrade cod by indirect oxidation according to the difference in electrodes external agents reaction conditions and reaction mechanisms in electrochemical reaction systems eaops can be divided into many types that is anodic oxidation ao electro fenton ef and photo electro fenton pef 13 for the main reaction zone for removing organic pollutants some are close to the anode some close to the cathode as an ao anodic catalytic oxidation with a dimensionally stabilized anode dsa shows advantages in the process of degradation of organic pollutants in cl containing wastewater due to its high electrocatalytic activity dsa can produce hypochlorite ions from the oxidation of chloride ions to oxidize organic matter and has the characteristics of mechanical stability and anode corrosion resistance 15 16 the main reaction for removing pollutants occurs near the anode anode electrocatalysis has great potential in the treatment of llc ef with a carbon ptfe air diffusion electrode whose cathode areas served as the main organic removal zone can produce h2o2 in situ through cathode aeration this h2o2 and an external fe catalyst then react to produce o h degrading organic pollutants 17 ef has been widely applied in the study of treatment of various kinds of wastewater containing high concentrations of organic pollutants including landfill leachate 13 18 wang et al obtained a total organic carbon toc removal efficiency of 82 by ef treatment of concentrate generated in the nanofiltration of biologically pretreated landfill leachate 19 the common drawbacks of various efs with air cathodes are that the reaction requires an external dosage of fe salts in acidic solution low utilization ratio of fe and h2o2 and a large amount of fe sludge formed with the characteristics of llc in mind in this study it was treated by a combination of anodic catalytic oxidation and cathode ef to solve the above problems a novel heterogeneous catalytic fe activated carbon titanium air cathode fe ac ti cathode was developed independently the organic compounds in the llc could be degraded by the fenton reaction in the cathode region without adding any fe or h2o2 to a certain extent overcoming the common drawbacks of ef with air cathodes moreover anode electro catalysis and cathode ef were applied to the same electrochemical system the anodic reaction zone eqs 1 4 20 21 and the cathode reaction zone eqs 5 7 22 could be used to remove organic matter in the llc simultaneously h2o2 is electro generated from the two electron reduction of o2 at the fe ac ti cathode eq 5 o h is generated from fenton s reaction of h2o2 and fe2 eq 6 anodic electrocatalysis or cathodic ef combined with other methods for organic wastewater treatment have been extensively reported but usually in a combined process one after another 12 23 the simultaneous use of anode electro catalysis and cathode ef in the same electrochemical system has rarely been reported 24 26 this is its first application to treat llc with dsa

bathed in 0 02 mol l 1 nitric acid solution then it was filtered and washed to neutral with deionized water 29 finally the activated carbon was dried at 105 for further use the appropriate concentration of ferrous sulfate solution was prepared ferrous sulfate was loaded on the activated carbon by wet impregnation after acid alkali washing the fe loaded activated carbon was completely dried at 105 then it was calcined at a certain temperature to prepare the heterogeneous catalyst after which it was cooled to room temperature to prepare the electrode 2 3 preparation of composite cathode the container with fe loaded active carbon catalyst was placed in the ultrasonic reactor where an appropriate amount of anhydrous ethanol was added after 5 min of ultrasonic vibration appropriate acetylene black and ptfe were added after 15 min of ultrasonic vibration the container was placed on the heater to maintain the temperature at 80 the mixture was evenly heated by mechanical agitation and the anhydrous ethanol was gradually evaporated from the mixture which was then glued to form a paste the paste mixture was placed on a smooth glass surface and rolled into a thin sheet the sheet was cut into an appropriate size and attached to the titanium mesh which served as the electrode framework the sheet was stabilized by appropriate pressure with a presser thus completing the fe ac ti composite electrode activated carbon titanium mesh composite electrodes were prepared following the same procedure without fe loading 2 4 experimental setup and electrochemical treatment the experimental setup is composed of a dc power supply reactor electrodes and aerator an undivided plexiglass container 16 cm 10 cm 5 cm was used as the reactor the electrode voltage was controlled by the dc power supply sg1731sc3a wenkai power equipment co ltd the air is injected into the container close to the cathode by the aerator to ensure o2 saturation aeration also plays the role of agitation for the llc the effective immersion area of the electrode was 24 square centimeters 4 cm 6 cm with 400 ml of water per reaction at appropriate time intervals samples were taken for chemical analysis all samples were measured in duplicate except toc and the average value was used in our study 2 5 experimental process to investigate the effect of the fe content in the catalyst on the performance of the electrode five groups of contrast experiments were carried out with a dsa anode to determine the optimal amount of loaded ferrous ions one used a common activated carbon based titanium mesh composite electrode as the cathode and 0 06 mmol l 1 feso4 was added to the system the other four used fe ac ti composite electrodes as cathodes with loads of 0 25 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 ferrous ions separately the cod content was measured every 20 min and the cod removal rate was calculated the amount of fe loaded ptfe dosage calcination temperature and the ratio of catalyst and acetylene black are the main factors affecting the performance of the electrode the electrochemical systems constructed with dsa anodes and cathodes made under different conditions were used to treat llc respectively by investigating the treatment effect of the system on llc the optimum preparation conditions of the electrode were obtained the conditions of the electrochemical wastewater treatment experiment were as follows ph of 3 applied voltage of 8 v electrode distance of 6 cm and reaction time of 140 min the above conditions were determined on the basis of preliminary experiments the influence of four factors on cod removal of llc was studied through single factor experiment using the control variable method that is under the condition that the three factors were kept unchanged the influence of the fourth factor on cod removal rate was investigated the experiment sequence of the four factors was electrode distance applied voltage initial ph and reaction time and their optimal conditions were obtained in order the optimal values obtained in the previous experiments were used as the settled conditions for the subsequent experiments finally the optimal conditions of each single factor experiment were obtained based on the results of the single factor experiment the reasonable interval of each influencing factor was determined and an orthogonal experiment with four factors and three levels was designed to study the optimum conditions and treatment effect of the llc by the combined anode electrocatalysis and cathodic ef system all experiments were verified with a second experiment if the both results matched each other closely the values of the first experiment were realized to be valid and taken if the differences were large the experiment would be reconducted until reasonably repeated values were obtained 2 6 analytical method the surface morphology of the cathode was observed using sigma zeiss σigma hd field emission scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive spectroscopy eds was used to analyze the load and consumption of fe x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was used to analyze the surface components of the cathode an autosorb iq specific surface and pore size analyzer supplied by the conta instrument company was used for the specific surface and aperture measurements toc was measured using a toc analyzer supplied by sievers innovox general electric analytical instruments company cod was determined by the potassium dichromate method china national standard gb 11914 89 ammonia nitrogen was determined by the distillation and titration method china national standard gb t 7478 1987 the wastewater was diluted to near colorless with colorless water according to the appropriate dilution multiple the multiple of dilution times is used to describe the color of the wastewater china national standard gb t 11903 1989 bod5 was determined by the dilution and seeding method china national standard hj505 2009 3 results and discussions 3 1 influencing factors of cathode preparation and characterization the experimental results of study on influencing factors of cathode preparation are shown in fig 1 according to fig 1 a the removal rate of cod of the ef system with fe ac ti composite cathodes loaded 0 5 ferrous was the highest combined with the results of the specific surface area and pore volume analysis table 2 it was indicated that when the amount of fenton catalyst ferrous loaded on the electrode was relatively small the effect of the heterogeneous fenton treatment was limited due to the low fe concentration however when the amount of ferrous loading was too high the mesoporous of activated carbon which were the main sites of the catalyst was blocked leading to a decrease in the catalytic performance of the electrode catalysts loaded with 0 5 iron were prepared by the impregnation method the dried catalysts were calcined in a muffle furnace at 100 200 300 and 400 for 3 h the other conditions were as follows the mass ratio of catalyst to ptfe and acetylene black were both 20 1 and the pressure of sheet making was 10 mpa as shown in fig 1 b with an increase in calcination temperature the removal rate of cod first increased and then decreased the catalytic activity of the fe ac ti composite electrode was the highest after the catalyst was calcined at 300 the oxygen surface groups such as carboxylic acid carboxylic anhydride and esters could be produced on the surface of the activated carbon in the process of calcination when the calcination temperature is between 100 and 200 the ferrous sulfate in the activated carbon promotes its pyrolysis to produce carboxylic acid and carboxylic anhydride 30 when the calcination temperature was between 200 c and 300 c the amounts of carboxylic acid and carboxylic anhydride decreased and the amount of lactone increased with increasing calcination temperature which made the ferrous sulfate disperse more evenly on the surface of the catalyst furthermore the activity of the catalyst increased and the decomposition rate of h2o2 also increased when the calcination temperature was higher than 400 c the lactone formed on the surface of activated carbon pyrolyzed resulting in poor dispersion of ferrous sulfate and low catalyst activity 31 therefore the final calcination temperature was set to 300 c when the mass ratio of catalyst to ptfe was 20 1 the ratio of catalyst to acetylene black was adjusted to 40 1 20 1 15 1 and 10 1 it was found that when the mass ratio was less than 15 1 slight cracks appeared in the electrode sheet made by the rolling method and when the mass ratio was less than 10 1 the electrode could not be prepared but when there was no acetylene black the stability of the electrode was reduced and the electrode was often damaged after ef treatment as can be seen from fig 1 c the cod removal rate of the electrode with a mass ratio of 40 1 was higher than the other two in the first 40 min then the growth rate slowed down and the final removal effect was lower than that of the other two when the mass ratio decreased to 20 1 and 15 1 the treatment effect of the llc was improved with an increase in the acetylene black content considering that the cost of acetylene black is far greater than activated carbon and the stability of the 15 1 electrode was limited the mass ratio of the catalyst to acetylene black was determined to be 20 1 the mass ratio of catalyst to ptfe was adjusted to 1 1 2 1 5 1 7 5 1 10 1 15 1 20 1 25 1 and 30 1 respectively the ptfe film coated on the catalyst surface transformed and contracted when ptfe reached its melting point at 330 more gas diffusion channels would form there to provide more active sites for the gas liquid reaction and enhance the cathodic catalytic activity 32 therefore the electrodes in different ratios of catalysts to ptfe were calcined at 330 for 3 h in a muffle furnace the effect of the treatment for llc before and after calcination was investigated when the mass ratio of catalyst to ptfe was greater than 20 1 the electrode sheet was unstable and tended to be damaged moreover when the mass ratio was 15 1 and 20 1 the structure of the electrode was destroyed after calcination because the binder component was too small black and red columns represent the removal rate of cod before and after calcining respectively in fig 1 d calcination process could obviously enhance the catalytic activity of the electrodes as well as the electric fenton treatment however the removal rate of cod decreased with an increased amount of ptfe because ptfe blocked the micro and mesopores of the activated carbon during the electrode preparation and hindered the loaded ferrous from participating in the fenton reaction considering the stability of the electrode and the removal effect of cod the mass ratio of catalyst to ptfe was determined to be 20 1 without high temperature calcination it is necessary to make electrodes by pressing an electrode sheet on a titanium mesh pressure determines the bonding effect of the electrode catalytic layer with titanium mesh thus affecting the catalytic activity and service life of the electrode when the pressure was 9 mpa and 10 mpa the removal effect of cod was almost the same considering that when the electrode pressed at 10 mpa the electrode was more stable the ideal pressure was determined to be 10 mpa sem eds shows that fe was present in the electrodes before and after the reaction as shown in fig a1 after the electrode was used it adsorbed a small amount of mg cl na c o and s elements in the llc fig a1 b in which the c and o elements are also elements contained in the activated carbon itself according to the analysis the impregnation method could effectively load the fe on the surface and in the activated carbon to form a heterogeneous fenton catalyst the fe ac ti composite electrode effectively suppressed the dissolution of fe ions the elemental composition and chemical states of the fe ac ti composite electrode were further studied by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps as shown in fig 2 before and after the reaction which further proves the above analysis the specific surface area and pore volume of the various fe loaded activated carbon and air cathode were measured the specific surface area was calculated using the bet equation the specific surface area and pore volume of the meso and microporous samples were calculated using the bjh and t plot models the results are summarized in table 2 it shows that the specific surface area and pore volume of activated carbon decreased after ferrous loading the specific surface area and pore volume of the mesoporous decreased significantly with an increase in the amount of fe loaded it was inferred that ferrous ions mainly existed in the mesopores of activated carbon when the catalysts were prepared by the impregnation method when the fe loading reached 1 of the mass of activated carbon the mesopores of activated carbon were basically blocked and the specific surface area and pore volume of the mesopores were much smaller the pores were partially blocked after the conductive agent and adhesives were added 3 2 influencing factors of llc treatment the electrochemical system constructed using the fe ac ti cathode and dsa anode was used to treat llc the effect of influencing factors are shown in fig 3 fig 3 a shows that the removal rate of cod in llc increased with a decrease in the electrode distance the maximum cod removal rate was reached when the electrode distance was 1 cm this was mainly because when applied voltage is constant the larger the electrode distance the smaller the current density which is not conducive to the production of o h and reactive cl and the regeneration of ferrous ions thus the smaller current density reduced the removal efficiency of cod in principle when the electrode distance is shorter the cod removal rate will further increase however if the electrode distance is less than 1 cm the distance between the electrode plates is difficult to control in practice the experiment will fail due to a possible short circuit of the system therefore 1 cm was decided as the optimal electrode distance as shown in fig 3 b the removal rate of cod increased with an increase in the applied voltage when it was less than 9 v when the voltage was 9 v the removal rate reached a maximum of 68 18 when the voltage was greater than 9 v the removal rate of cod decreased with an increase in voltage this can be ascribed to the fact that with the increase in applied voltage the current intensity increased the ions migrated faster the regeneration rate of ferrous ions and the production rate of o h increased promoting the electrochemical reaction however when the applied voltage was too high the excessive current density caused the hydrogen evolution reaction on the cathode material surface via eq 8 the reduction of the current utilization rate of the system hindered the regenerating reaction of ferrous ions which was counted against the generation of o h in addition as the voltage increased the energy consumption and running cost increased 8 2h2o 2e h2 2oh according to fig 3 c anodic electrocatalysis combined with cathodic ef had a wider ph effective range than the classical ef process when the ph value was between 2 and 6 the system had a better cod removal effect and smaller fluctuation with ph values when the ph value rose to or higher than 7 such as to 8 63 the initial ph value of raw llc cod removal efficiency decreased significantly but still reached 60 20 ph 7 and 54 28 ph 8 63 in the conventional ef process the treatment effect of the fenton reaction fluctuates greatly with the ph value of the solution when the initial ph of the solution is too low h2o2 traps protons to form electrophilic h3o2 which inhibits the fenton reaction when the ph value of the solution was higher than 4 0 the production efficiency of h2o2 decreased and fe2 was easily oxidized to fe3 to form ferric hydroxide precipitation which hindered the fenton reaction therefore the optimum ph range of the ef reaction solution is generally 2 8 3 5 22 33 it was believed through the preliminary analysis that the electrocatalytic reaction of the anode enlarged the applicable range of the ph value of the system this result is of great significance to the industrial application of anodic electrocatalysis and the cathodic ef process in treating llc a wider ph interval meant a reduction in the acid dosage and reaction cost before the fenton process according to fig 3 d the removal rate of cod increased with the reaction time the value of cod was reduced from 1418 24 mg l 1 to 110 8 mg l 1 in 280 min with a cod removal rate of 92 19 after 320 min it continued to decrease to 44 32 mg l 1 with the removal rate reaching 96 88 considering that the energy consumption of the system increased with the extension of the treatment time after 320 min and the improvement of the cod treatment effect was limited the optimal reaction time of the system was determined to be 320 min in order to further analyze the contribution of anodic electrocatalysis to the removal of cod of the concentrated solution the ph value and the concentrations of cl and clo with the reaction time under the optimal conditions obtained by single factor experiments were investigated and are shown in fig 4 the hypochlorite ions produced by the anode electrocatalytic reaction gradually increased the ph of the solution to weak alkaline via eq 9 the formation of hypochlorite was inhibited by acidic conditions in the first 40 min during this period the concentration of hypochlorite was lower and the cod decomposed rapidly it was presumed that the degradation of cod in the first 40 min 46 15 removal rate mainly depended on the cathodic ef reaction and anodic electrochemical oxidation and anodic production of o h played a minor role the ph of llc rose to weak alkalinity after 40 min of reaction the formation rate of hypochlorite was accelerated and the concentration of hypochlorite in the solution was higher when the reaction lasted for 40 80 min when the reaction lasted for 80 240 min the concentration of hypochlorite in the system tended to stability it was presumed that anodic electrochemical oxidation and hypochlorite produced by the anode electrocatalytic process played an important role in the degradation of cod with cathodic ef playing a certain role after 240 min hypochlorite ions accumulated with a decrease in cod concentration the degradation of cod mainly depended on anodic electrochemical oxidation and hypochlorite of course actual reactions in the system rich in h2o2 and chloride ions might be much more complicated 34 9 clo h2o hclo oh the extremely high color of llc is one of the major problems in treatment anode electrocatalytic oxidation combined with the cathode ef method can effectively degrade the color of llc the effect of color treatment is shown in fig 5 a the color of the llc was decreased to one from 980 times that of the original wastewater after 80 min of reaction later as the reaction time increased the color of the water sample gradually darkened it is plausible that a high concentration of hypochlorite ions turned the solution pale yellow in order to verify the hypothesis that the presence of high concentrations of hypochlorite led to the color deepening with the increase in treatment time the experiment compared the pale yellow water samples taken at 320 min before and after removing hypochlorite as shown in fig 5 b the results of the experiment confirmed this hypothesis in fact disinfectants need to be sprayed in an msw landfill to sanitize it the effluent from an electrochemical system containing hypochlorite can operate as a suitable disinfectant 3 3 orthogonal experiment according to the single factor experiment results the reasonable value range of each factor in the orthogonal experiment was determined according to fig 3 d the removal rate of cod increased with the increase of reaction time the value of cod was reduced to 110 8 mg l 1 in 280 min after 320 min it continued to decrease to 44 32 mg l 1 the concentration of cod was close to the emission standard 100 mg l 1 when the experiment processed for 280 min and it was too low when the it processed for 320 min considering that the best treatment effect obtained by the orthogonal experiment must be better than the single factor experiment 320 min would not be a good option to be used for the investigation and determination of the influence of various factors in the orthogonal experiment therefore 280 min was determined to use for the subsequent orthogonal experiment in the experiment the removal rates of cod and toc were used as the research object and the improvement of bod5 cod ratios b c were also investigated the design and results of the orthogonal experiment are shown in table 3 range analysis of cod and toc are listed in tables 4 and 5 k i j represents the sum of the removal rate of the i level in column j in k i j represents the average removal rate of the i level in column j via k i j 1 3 k i j r denotes the range of k1 k2 and k3 of column j via r j m a x k 1 j k 2 j k 3 j m i n k 1 j k 2 j k 3 j according to the orthogonal experiment theory the optimum condition of each factor as well as the optimal combination of factors can be determined by judging the averages k i j 35 36 the larger the average the better the experimental conditions the range values reflect an individual factor s effect on the removal rates the range analysis of cod removal indicate that cod removal was influenced by the following factors in descending order electrode distance cm initial ph interaction between electrode distance and applied voltage applied voltage v according to the orthogonal experiment results the optimal level of cod removal was a1b3c3 that is electrode distance of 1 cm applied voltage of 10 v and initial solution ph of 7 the optimum cod removal rate was 97 06 the range analysis of toc indicated that the toc removal was influenced by the following factors in descending order applied voltage v initial ph interaction between electrode distance and applied voltage electrode distance cm the optimal level of toc removal was electrode distance of 3 cm applied voltage of 8 v and initial solution ph of 3 because the optimum treatment conditions were not in the orthogonal experiment table verification experiments in the optimum treatment conditions were carried out the results show that the concentration of toc was reduced from 547 mg l 1 to 212 mg l 1 with a removal rate of 61 24 by anodic electrocatalysis and cathodic electro fenton treatment over 280 min it can be seen from table 3 that anodic electrocatalysis combined with the cathodic ef method also had a strong effect on b c elevation and the b c ratios of all tests increased from 0 03 to between 0 23 and 0 51 increasing the biodegradability of llc when the cod removal efficiency was the highest cod concentrate was 44 48 mg l 1 because it could be discharged directly at this level it is of no practical significance to investigate the biodegradability therefore the bod5 value was not measured and the b c ratio was not calculated comparing optimal conditions for cod and toc removal obtained from the orthogonal experiments the initial ph varied largely and the decrease in cod was not linearly related to the removal of toc which represents the degree of mineralization acidic conditions were more conducive to mineralization of organic matter while neutral conditions had a higher removal rate of oxygen consuming substances in the vicinity of ph 3 which was more conducive to the fenton reaction the cathodic ef effect of the system dominated and oxidized organic compounds by o h which had a higher redox potential the optimum cod removal rate obtained by the orthogonal experiment was 97 06 which was greater than the 92 19 at 280 min under the optimum conditions obtained by the single factor experiment the results showed that the optimum initial solution ph was 7 which differed greatly from the optimum ph of the ef reaction between 2 8 3 5 this indicated that anodic electrocatalysis and the interaction of various factors had a large impact on the reaction the variation of hypochlorite concentration with time was investigated and compared under the optimum conditions obtained by single factor and orthogonal experiment respectively the specific results are shown in fig 6 the black curve represents the change in hypochlorite concentration with time under the optimum conditions of the orthogonal experiment and the red curve is the change in hypochlorite concentration with time under the optimum condition of the single factor experiment it can be seen that the initial ph of 7 inhibited the occurrence of anodic production of o h and the cathodic fenton reaction to a certain extent but greatly increased the rate of hypochlorite formation thus the overall cod removal efficiency was better in addition in the single factor test curve the hypochlorite concentration continued to increase while in the orthogonal test curve there was a significant fluctuation of the hypochlorite concentration in the last stage obviously the increase of the initial ph accelerates the reaction rate eqs 2 and 3 which was beneficial to the faster accumulation of hypochlorite therefore the hypochlorite concentration in the orthogonal test curve was higher than that in the single factor test curve if reaction time was the same and it reached the maximum at 150 min there after when the consumption of hypochlorite organics ocl intermediates co2 cl h2o 37 was more than the production the concentration would decrease on the contrary it would rise to investigate whether the cathodic ef reaction contributed to the degradation of cod titanium mesh was used as the cathodic reaction for 280 min under the same conditions the cod of the effluent was 328 08 mg l 1 which was much higher than the 77 84 mg l 1 obtained in the original system with the fe ac ti composite electrode therefore it was convinced that the ef reaction still took place at a ph of 7 which played an important role in the degradation of cod in the whole system the reaction process of cl containing and complex component llc in the co existing system of electrocatalysis and ef was more complicated 34 the specific reaction mechanism is not included in the scope of this study it should be noted that the limits of discharge concentration of water pollutants from municipal solid waste landfills is stipulated in the standard for pollution control on the landfill site of municipal solid waste gb 16889 2008 china but there is no requirement for toc concentration the main pollution indicators of llc after treatment with ef met the discharge standards of china for landfill leachate cod 100 mg l 1 and color 40 times 4 conclusion a novel heterogeneous catalytic cathode iron activated carbon titanium air cathode was successfully developed and used to treat llc the electrochemical system constructed with a dsa and a self developed cathode could effectively degrade cod toc and color in the llc by the synergistic effect of anodic electrocatalysis and cathodic ef and significantly improve its biodegradability through single factor and orthogonal experiments the optimum treatment conditions for llc by the synergistic effect of electrocatalysis and ef were obtained under these conditions the cod concentration of llc decreased from 1512 32 mg l 1 to 44 48 mg l 1 with a removal rate as high as 97 06 moreover the electrochemical system without adding any h2o2 or ferrous ions has a much larger ph range than the classical ef method after the reaction the effluent was neutral or weakly alkaline which greatly reduced the amount of reagent needed to adjust the ph before and after the reaction thus reducing operation cost declaration of competing interest the authors

13904,iron encrustation was deduced as the bottleneck for ferrous ion dependent nitrate removal fenir process development to avoid the formation of iron encrustation co substrate cultivation molar ratio of nitrate ferrous sulfate and acetate at 8 20 1 was adopted the fenir rate remained at 0 51 kg n m3 d for 40 days the death rate of cells slowed down and the specific fenir activity of sludge kept at 0 73 mg n g vss h both facultative heterotrophic denitrifier and obligate heterotrophic denitrifier existed but the latter was deduced as the main contributor a barrier around obligate heterotrophic denitrifier was observed cells inside the barrier were without iron encrustation with insufficient organics the nitrate was reduced to nitrite biologically and the nitrite travelled outside the barrier and reacted with ferrous ion chemically to accomplish fenir with acetate as co substrate the formation of iron encrustation was efficiently avoided and a high and stable fenir efficiency was achieved keywords ferrous iron dependent nitrate removal fenir co substrate denitrifying efficiency microbial characteristics 1 introduction for the treatment of low c n ratio wastewaters organics are always added as electron donor for traditional nitrate removal the addition of organics not only increases the operating cost but also potentially causes secondary pollution 1 2 insufficient organic carbon source becomes the bottleneck of traditional processes for biological nitrogen removal a novel autotrophic denitrification technology with ferrous ion as electron donor was kicked off by straub et al in 1996 3 the ferrous ion salt is very cheap and its easy availability makes the novel autotrophic denitrification technology cost effective and an attractive option for biological nitrate removal moreover the excess ferrous ion could be used to precipitate phosphate in wastewater treatment 4 in our previous work the ferrous ion dependent nitrate removal fenir rate with activated sludge as inoculum from a sewage treatment plant stp could be stable at 0 09 kg n m3 d 5 with heterotrophic denitrifying sludge as inoculum the fenir rate increased to 0 7 kg n m3 d but it only lasted for 18 days then the fenir rate decreased and stabilized finally at around 0 22 kg n m3 d 6 the performance deterioration was caused by the iron encrustation which was formed on the cell surface or in the periplasm as soon as ferrous ion was oxidized to ferric ion under neutral ph 7 8 the iron encrustation enveloped microbial cells and hindered nutrients transportation between cells and the environment leading to cell inactivation or even cell death 9 to improve the fenir process the iron encrustation should be minimized and avoided in 2009 a theory called co substrate cultivation was proposed by webber et al 10 according to this theory acetate was added into the system as co substrate and remarkable improvement of fenir rate was observed by pure culture 3 11 when both organic electron donor and inorganic electron donor were present microbes preferred to use the organic electron donor as the first substrate while the inorganic electron donor as the second substrate only when the first substrate was insufficient the second substrate would be used by microbes moreover less iron encrustation was observed when acetate was used as co substrate 11 the same operation and similar results were obtained for the sulfide dependent denitrification with the addition of organic matters the culture showed a higher nitrate removal capacity 12 in this paper the theory of co substrate cultivation was used to improve the fenir efficiency at the reactor level with mixed culture the reactor performance was monitored and evaluated the corresponding characteristics of fenir sludge were revealed and the fenir mechanism under co substrate cultivation was proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor operation an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor with working volume of 1 2 l was used the denitrifying sludge from a lab scale heterotrophic denitrification reactor was sampled as the inoculated sludge which was consisted of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria 80 autotrophic denitrifying bacteria and mixotrophic denitrifying bacteria and bacteria with no denitrification function 13 the ss suspended solids and vss volatile suspended solids of the sampled sludge were 27 82 g l and 16 4 g l the reactor was named fenir reactor the hydraulic retention time hrt of fenir reactor was set at 6 h the reactor was operated at around 30 c in a dark room by stoichiometry calculation the molar ratio of nitrate ferrous sulfate and acetate in the influent was 8 32 1 namely 80 nitrate was expected to be reduced by ferrous sulfate while the rest 20 nitrate was reduced by acetate however when to operate the fenir reactor with this ratio amount of ferrous ion was detected in the effluent it was deduced that nitrate was only reduced to be nitric oxide rather than nitrogen gas by ferrous ion biologically thus the molar ratio of nitrate ferrous sulfate and acetate in the influent was adjusted to be 8 20 1 the detailed composition of the influent was described in table 1 the ph of the influent was regulated at 6 6 0 1 using naoh 1 0 m and hcl 1 0 m solutions the concentrations of nitrate nitrite ferrous ion and total iron in both influent and effluent were measured everyday immediately after sampling to evaluate the fenir performance 2 2 morphology observation the surface morphology and profile morphology of the granular sludge were observed and photographed using a digital camera cannon 70d japan and a stereoscope zeiss discovery v8 germany the cell morphology was observed by the transmission electron microscope tem the sample preparation for tem was carried out according to the method as described by wang et al 14 2 3 the live dead cell percentage the sludge was sampled and immersed into 0 85 nacl solution and the granular sludge was crushed by ultrasound to obtain suspended cell solution in the dark the cell suspension was fluorescently stained for 10 min using a live dead fluorescence identification kit molecular probes usa the appropriate amount of cell suspension was smeared on the slide with an inoculating loop and the slide was observed by a fluorescence microscope zeiss german the number of live dead cells in the view was counted using image pro plus 6 0 software and the ratio of live dead cells to total cells was calculated 15 2 4 the specific fenir activity the specific fenir activity of the granular sludge was determined by batch tests serum bottles with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum caps were filled with 10 ml synthetic wastewater in the experimental group activated sludge was added while in the control group there was no activated sludge argon gas was bubbled in the reaction system to displace oxygen for 10 min then ferrous sulfate was added the serum bottle was sealed and reinforced with an aluminum cover serum bottles were placed on a shaker at 120 r min and 30 c to perform the fenir reaction duplicate experiments were set in each group and the supernatant was taken at regular intervals to determine the content of nitrate and ferrous ion in the reaction system 2 5 microbial community analysis the next generation sequencing technology ngs was used to analyze the microbial community in fenir sludg the dna of granular sludge was extracted by a dna extraction kit mp biochemicals usa bacterial universal primers 338 f 5 actc ctac ggga ggcag 3 and 805r 5 gact acca gggt atct aatcc 3 were used for pcr amplification of the 16s rrna genes the pcr amplification and gene sequencing were accomplished by majorbio co ltd shanghai china 2 6 other methods vss and ss values were measured according to the method as described by wang et al 13 concentrations of nitrate nitrite ferrous iron total iron were determined according to the standard methods apha 2005 the ph values were determined by a s20 k ph meter mettler toledo switzerland 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performance with co substrate the whole operation of the fenir reactor lasted for 50 days and fig 1 illustrates the performance of the reactor with acetate as co substrate according to the fenir efficiency the whole operation process could be divided into two stages in stage i day 0 8 the fenir efficiency increased gradually to 98 the volumetric removal rate vrr of nitrate nitrogen reached 0 74 kg n m3 d the concentration of effluent nitrate nitrogen was below 3 mg n l which met the sewage discharge standards in china in stage ii day 9 50 the fenir efficiency was stable at a low level of 67 the corresponding vrr of nitrogen kept at around 0 51 kg n m3 d the average effluent nitrate concentration was 22 59 mg n l indicating further treatment was necessary before discharging during the whole reactor operation the effluent ph was stable at 6 5 0 2 the average molar ratio of removed fe to removed n was 5 6 1 which was higher than the stoichiometry ratio of ferrous ion to nitrate that might be caused by the obligate heterotrophic denitrifier to perform fenir by electron sparing which was described below when the denitrification efficiency decreased nitrite was detected in the effluent however in the previous studies without organic matter addition nitrite was not detected in the reactor effluent the production of nitrite was deduced to be caused by the insufficient organics in the influent without enough organics the heterotrophic denitrification process was incomplete leading to the accumulation of nitrite however after 40 days of reactor operation little nitrite was detected in the effluent the decrease of effluent nitrite was deduced to be caused by the final balance of substrate and the microbial biomass the organics in influent cannot support all the heterotrophic denitrifier to perform denitrification thus some heterotrophs died with the insufficient organic substrate the nitrate could only be reduced to nitrite the bio toxic nitrite was excreted extracellular and then reacted with ferrous ion to realize fenir in summary an improvement of fenir efficiency was obviously observed with acetate as co substrate a previous research showed high fenir rate at 0 7 kg n m3 d but this high rate only remained stable for 18 days and finally the rate decreased to 0 22 kg n m3 d 6 in this study with acetate as co substrate the fenir rate remained stable at 0 51 kg n m3 d for 40 days hence using acetate as co substrate benefited the fenir process in the removal of pollutants 3 2 sludge characteristics with co substrate cultivation in order to reveal the mechanism of fenir efficiency improvement by co substrate the characteristics of fenir sludge sampled on day 1 8 20 28 and 45 were determined and described below 3 2 1 the microbial community analysis the next generation sequencing technology ngs was used to analyze the microbial community in fenir sludge from fig 2 a the most predominant bacterial phylum in fenir sludge was proteobacteria which accounted for more than 50 at any time during the cultivation and along with time its proportion gradually increased another increase of proportion happened to acidobacteria from almost zero on day 1 to 7 73 on day 45 in contrast the proportion of firmicutes and actinobacteria decreased along with time for firmicutes the proportion decreased from 23 35 to 16 55 in 45 days while for actinobacteria it was from 12 27 to 1 25 fig 2 b showed the relative abundance of microbes at the genus level the predominant bacterial genus in fenir sludge was castellaniella clostridium sensu stricto 7 comamonas clostridium sensu stricto 10 thermomonas and rhodanobacter in order among them castellaniella comamonas thermomonas and rhodanobacter belong to proteobacteria and all of them are facultative heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria 16 22 the overall proportion of these five genera increased from 26 63 on day 1 to 45 85 on day 45 both clostridium sensu stricto 7 and clostridium sensu stricto 10 belong to firmicutes and they are obligate heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria 23 24 their overall proportion in sludge decreased a bit from 16 30 on day 1 to 13 37 on day 45 the lack of organics in influent was supposed to be the reason for the proportion decrease of obligate heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria 3 2 2 the active biomass content the combination of vss content and live cell percentage was used to characterize the active biomass content in the sludge along with the cultivation time the ss content the vss content and vss ss value in sludge were determined calculated and shown in fig 3 the ss content in sludge increased gradually while the vss content decreased resulting in the decrease of vss ss value this result was expected as the iron encrustation was formed around cells in fenir process and the density of iron encrustation was much higher than that of sludge 5 fig 4 a illustrates the change of the live cell percentage in fenir sludge along with the cultivation time the live cell percentage in fenir sludge decreased linearly from 78 2 on day 1 to 40 3 on day 45 by linear fitting the attenuation coefficient of live cell percentage in fenir sludge with acetate as co substrate was lower than that in fenir sludge without acetate as co substrate 0 8627 vs 1 0949 namely with acetate as co substrate the death of fenir cells slowed down 3 2 3 the specific fenir activity the specific fenir activity of granular sludge was determined by batch test and results were shown in fig 5 the specific fenir activity of inoculated sludge namely sample on day 1 was 1 71 mg n g vss h then along with time the specific fenir activity of sludge decreased and finally stabilized at around 0 73 mg n g vss h which was only 42 7 of the activity in sample on day 1 in contrast to vss content and live cell percentage the specific fenir activity did not show a linear decline trend with time instead the specific fenir activity of sludge remained stable after decreasing by half this was in consistent with the reactor performance described in section 3 1 3 2 4 the sludge morphology tem was used to observe the internal structure of microbial cells in all samples fig 6 even with acetate as co substrate iron encrustation was formed around cells but not around all cells the live cells without iron encrustation seemed to gather together and formed a barrier surrounding them to prevent iron from the outside the barrier clearly separated the encrusted cells and the un encrusted cells at the early stage of reactor operation cells within the barrier were hardly to be observed with iron encrustation and there was no iron precipitation within the barrier signifying the strong shielding effect of the barrier to ferrous ferric ion with the passage of time the cell group surrounded by the barrier became smaller and more cells were observed being attached with iron encrustation the barrier was supposed being damaged and the barrier effect was weakened the barrier was deduced as the extracellular polymer eps secreted by the fenir cells as 1 the inoculum was heterotrophic denitrifying granular sludge and 2 acetate was offered in the influent eps was viscous and possessed the mesh structure to stop the ferrous ion ferric ion to go through the barrier this was the shielding effect of the barrier 25 26 according to the microbial community analysis of fenir sludge there were at least two kinds of denitrifer in the fenir reactor namely the facultative heterotrophic denitrifier and the obligate heterotrophic denitrifier however the autotrophic denitrifier could not be excluded even the inoculum was from the heterotrophic denitrification reactor the fenir mechanisms were reported to be diverse as not only autotrophic denitrifier and facultative heterotrophic denitrifier but also obligate heterotrophic denitrifier had the ability to perform fenir 9 27 28 for the autotrophic denitrifier and facultative heterotrophic denitrifier the ferrous ion donated electrons to the cytochrome c type protein cyc2 which was located on the outer membrane of cell 29 or to the nitrate reduction enzyme nar which was located on the inner membrane of cell 30 this was the biological oxidation of ferrous ion carlson et al pointed out that the ferrous ion oxidation is an innate capability of denitrifier as ferrous ion could be chemically oxidized by nitrite which was the intermediate product of denitrification 31 the chemical reaction between nitrite and ferrous ion was very fast from the perspective of kinetics 32 thus concurrent of chemically and biologically ferrous ion oxidation was possible in fenir process 33 and the chemically ferrous ion oxidation was dominant 16 with both ferrous ion and acetate as substrates three kinds of denirifier co existed in the fenir reactor the autotrophic denitrifier used ferrous ion to reduce nitrate and iron encrustation was formed around them at the very early stage however for the facultative heterotrophic denitrifier and the obligate heterotrophic denitrifier they preferred to use acetate to reduce nitrate and reproduce because the heterotrophic denitrification yielded more energy comparing with the autotrophic denitrification 34 35 therefore the nitrate reduction rate was high in stage i section 3 1 as all three kinds of denitrifiers carried out fenir reaction the influent organic matter was insufficient to support a large number of heterotrophic bacteria resulting in less eps production and worse barrier function ferrous ion went through the barrier and the facultative heterotrophic denitrifier used ferrous ion as electron donor resulting in the formation of iron incrustation with the iron encrustation the activity of both the autotrophic denitrifier and the facultative heterotrophic denitrifier was inhibited thus resulting in the decrease of fenir efficiency at the reactor level in stage ii section 3 1 with less eps production and worse barrier function the original big cell group surrounded by the barrier broke up into several small cell groups fig 6 for the obligate heterotrophic denitrifier limited organic matter in the influent could not support their survival but they were detected by ngs and observed by tem in sample on day 42 the possible reason is the electron sparing a mechanism of iron oxidizers when co substrate was available as electron donor 31 the limited organics were used to reduce nitrate to nitrite then the nitrite was released outside the cell even outside the barrier that s why there was no iron encrustation around the obligate heterotrophic denitrifier to react with the ferrous ion more nitrate would be consumed in such a mechanism and an energetic benefit to the organism would be gained per mole of electron donor that s why nitrite was detected in the effluent during the reactor operation fig 1 c the outgoing nitrite met ferrous ion to produce gaseous nitrogen compounds and ferric ion accomplishing the fenir reaction 3 3 the mechanism of fenir efficiency improvement with acetate as co substrate with acetate as co substrate the fenir rate improved significantly by more than 2 times when comparing with the previous report of fenir rate without acetate as co substrate 0 51 kg n m3 d vs 0 22 kg n m3 d 6 that indicated co substrate benefited the fenir process to realize high efficiency moreover the high fenir efficiency with acetate as co substrate could maintain for more than 40 days without acetate as co substrate the fenir efficiency declined progressively along with time 6 using acetate as co substrate not only improved the fenir efficiency but also kept the high fenir efficiency stable the live cell percentage in sludge decreased linearly in 42 days but it was slower than that in sludge cultivated without acetate as co substrate that signified the co substrate cultivation slowed down the death rate of cells and thus maintained a high active biomass content in the sludge further the specific fenir activity of sludge was detected to be stable at about 0 73 mg n g vss h the high active biomass content and stable specific fenir activity ensured the fenir efficiency at high level from the microbial community analysis both facultative and obligate heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria existed in the fenir reactor during the whole operation with co substrate cultivation both heterotrophic denitrification and autotrophic denitrification took place the diversity of denitrification pathways was improved and very likely resulted in the high fenir efficiency combining with the results by tem and ngs facultative and obligate heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria co existed to perform fenir at the late stage of reactor operation the activities of autotrophic denitrifier were inhibited as iron encrustation was formed around them reports about how the facultative heterotrophic denitrifier perform fenir are already available 6 the conceptual model of fenir mechanism for obligate heterotrophic denitrifier with acetate as co substrate was shown in fig 7 acetate donated electrons to the quinone then the electrons travelled to participate in the denitrification process a part of nitrite participated in the general process of heterotrophic denitrification as shown in fig 7 the other part of nitrite went outside of the cells to react with ferrous ion thus the corresponding electrons were spared and an energetic benefit happened to the obligate heterotrophic denitrifier with this energetic benefit and acetate as carbon source obligate heterotrophic denitrifier produced eps to build the barrier with the shielding effect of the barrier no iron encrustation would be formed around the obligate heterotrophic denitrifier thus the specific fenir activity stayed long ensuring the high fenir efficiency at the reactor level with acetate as co substrate it was deduced that the improvement of fenir efficiency and the stability of fenir efficiency were mainly attributed to the efforts by obligate heterotrophic denitrifier 4 conclusions with acetate as co substrate the fenir rate stabilized at 0 51 kg n m3 d for 40 days the death rate of cells was slowed down and the formation of iron encrustation was effectively avoided the obligate heterotrophic denitrifier were the main force for the stability and improvement of fenir efficiency with acetate as co substrate a barrier was formed around obligate heterotrophic denitrifier to keep the ferrous ion away from cells thus forming less iron encrustation the nitrate was reduced to nitrite biologically due to limited organics then the nitrite traveled outside the barrier to react with ferrous ion chemically to accomplish fenir acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china 51608474

13904,iron encrustation was deduced as the bottleneck for ferrous ion dependent nitrate removal fenir process development to avoid the formation of iron encrustation co substrate cultivation molar ratio of nitrate ferrous sulfate and acetate at 8 20 1 was adopted the fenir rate remained at 0 51 kg n m3 d for 40 days the death rate of cells slowed down and the specific fenir activity of sludge kept at 0 73 mg n g vss h both facultative heterotrophic denitrifier and obligate heterotrophic denitrifier existed but the latter was deduced as the main contributor a barrier around obligate heterotrophic denitrifier was observed cells inside the barrier were without iron encrustation with insufficient organics the nitrate was reduced to nitrite biologically and the nitrite travelled outside the barrier and reacted with ferrous ion chemically to accomplish fenir with acetate as co substrate the formation of iron encrustation was efficiently avoided and a high and stable fenir efficiency was achieved keywords ferrous iron dependent nitrate removal fenir co substrate denitrifying efficiency microbial characteristics 1 introduction for the treatment of low c n ratio wastewaters organics are always added as electron donor for traditional nitrate removal the addition of organics not only increases the operating cost but also potentially causes secondary pollution 1 2 insufficient organic carbon source becomes the bottleneck of traditional processes for biological nitrogen removal a novel autotrophic denitrification technology with ferrous ion as electron donor was kicked off by straub et al in 1996 3 the ferrous ion salt is very cheap and its easy availability makes the novel autotrophic denitrification technology cost effective and an attractive option for biological nitrate removal moreover the excess ferrous ion could be used to precipitate phosphate in wastewater treatment 4 in our previous work the ferrous ion dependent nitrate removal fenir rate with activated sludge as inoculum from a sewage treatment plant stp could be stable at 0 09 kg n m3 d 5 with heterotrophic denitrifying sludge as inoculum the fenir rate increased to 0 7 kg n m3 d but it only lasted for 18 days then the fenir rate decreased and stabilized finally at around 0 22 kg n m3 d 6 the performance deterioration was caused by the iron encrustation which was formed on the cell surface or in the periplasm as soon as ferrous ion was oxidized to ferric ion under neutral ph 7 8 the iron encrustation enveloped microbial cells and hindered nutrients transportation between cells and the environment leading to cell inactivation or even cell death 9 to improve the fenir process the iron encrustation should be minimized and avoided in 2009 a theory called co substrate cultivation was proposed by webber et al 10 according to this theory acetate was added into the system as co substrate and remarkable improvement of fenir rate was observed by pure culture 3 11 when both organic electron donor and inorganic electron donor were present microbes preferred to use the organic electron donor as the first substrate while the inorganic electron donor as the second substrate only when the first substrate was insufficient the second substrate would be used by microbes moreover less iron encrustation was observed when acetate was used as co substrate 11 the same operation and similar results were obtained for the sulfide dependent denitrification with the addition of organic matters the culture showed a higher nitrate removal capacity 12 in this paper the theory of co substrate cultivation was used to improve the fenir efficiency at the reactor level with mixed culture the reactor performance was monitored and evaluated the corresponding characteristics of fenir sludge were revealed and the fenir mechanism under co substrate cultivation was proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor operation an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor with working volume of 1 2 l was used the denitrifying sludge from a lab scale heterotrophic denitrification reactor was sampled as the inoculated sludge which was consisted of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria 80 autotrophic denitrifying bacteria and mixotrophic denitrifying bacteria and bacteria with no denitrification function 13 the ss suspended solids and vss volatile suspended solids of the sampled sludge were 27 82 g l and 16 4 g l the reactor was named fenir reactor the hydraulic retention time hrt of fenir reactor was set at 6 h the reactor was operated at around 30 c in a dark room by stoichiometry calculation the molar ratio of nitrate ferrous sulfate and acetate in the influent was 8 32 1 namely 80 nitrate was expected to be reduced by ferrous sulfate while the rest 20 nitrate was reduced by acetate however when to operate the fenir reactor with this ratio amount of ferrous ion was detected in the effluent it was deduced that nitrate was only reduced to be nitric oxide rather than nitrogen gas by ferrous ion biologically thus the molar ratio of nitrate ferrous sulfate and acetate in the influent was adjusted to be 8 20 1 the detailed composition of the influent was described in table 1 the ph of the influent was regulated at 6 6 0 1 using naoh 1 0 m and hcl 1 0 m solutions the concentrations of nitrate nitrite ferrous ion and total iron in both influent and effluent were measured everyday immediately after sampling to evaluate the fenir performance 2 2 morphology observation the surface morphology and profile morphology of the granular sludge were observed and photographed using a digital camera cannon 70d japan and a stereoscope zeiss discovery v8 germany the cell morphology was observed by the transmission electron microscope tem the sample preparation for tem was carried out according to the method as described by wang et al 14 2 3 the live dead cell percentage the sludge was sampled and immersed into 0 85 nacl solution and the granular sludge was crushed by ultrasound to obtain suspended cell solution in the dark the cell suspension was fluorescently stained for 10 min using a live dead fluorescence identification kit molecular probes usa the appropriate amount of cell suspension was smeared on the slide with an inoculating loop and the slide was observed by a fluorescence microscope zeiss german the number of live dead cells in the view was counted using image pro plus 6 0 software and the ratio of live dead cells to total cells was calculated 15 2 4 the specific fenir activity the specific fenir activity of the granular sludge was determined by batch tests serum bottles with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum caps were filled with 10 ml synthetic wastewater in the experimental group activated sludge was added while in the control group there was no activated sludge argon gas was bubbled in the reaction system to displace oxygen for 10 min then ferrous sulfate was added the serum bottle was sealed and reinforced with an aluminum cover serum bottles were placed on a shaker at 120 r min and 30 c to perform the fenir reaction duplicate experiments were set in each group and the supernatant was taken at regular intervals to determine the content of nitrate and ferrous ion in the reaction system 2 5 microbial community analysis the next generation sequencing technology ngs was used to analyze the microbial community in fenir sludg the dna of granular sludge was extracted by a dna extraction kit mp biochemicals usa bacterial universal primers 338 f 5 actc ctac ggga ggcag 3 and 805r 5 gact acca gggt atct aatcc 3 were used for pcr amplification of the 16s rrna genes the pcr amplification and gene sequencing were accomplished by majorbio co ltd shanghai china 2 6 other methods vss and ss values were measured according to the method as described by wang et al 13 concentrations of nitrate nitrite ferrous iron total iron were determined according to the standard methods apha 2005 the ph values were determined by a s20 k ph meter mettler toledo switzerland 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performance with co substrate the whole operation of the fenir reactor lasted for 50 days and fig 1 illustrates the performance of the reactor with acetate as co substrate according to the fenir efficiency the whole operation process could be divided into two stages in stage i day 0 8 the fenir efficiency increased gradually to 98 the volumetric removal rate vrr of nitrate nitrogen reached 0 74 kg n m3 d the concentration of effluent nitrate nitrogen was below 3 mg n l which met the sewage discharge standards in china in stage ii day 9 50 the fenir efficiency was stable at a low level of 67 the corresponding vrr of nitrogen kept at around 0 51 kg n m3 d the average effluent nitrate concentration was 22 59 mg n l indicating further treatment was necessary before discharging during the whole reactor operation the effluent ph was stable at 6 5 0 2 the average molar ratio of removed fe to removed n was 5 6 1 which was higher than the stoichiometry ratio of ferrous ion to nitrate that might be caused by the obligate heterotrophic denitrifier to perform fenir by electron sparing which was described below when the denitrification efficiency decreased nitrite was detected in the effluent however in the previous studies without organic matter addition nitrite was not detected in the reactor effluent the production of nitrite was deduced to be caused by the insufficient organics in the influent without enough organics the heterotrophic denitrification process was incomplete leading to the accumulation of nitrite however after 40 days of reactor operation little nitrite was detected in the effluent the decrease of effluent nitrite was deduced to be caused by the final balance of substrate and the microbial biomass the organics in influent cannot support all the heterotrophic denitrifier to perform denitrification thus some heterotrophs died with the insufficient organic substrate the nitrate could only be reduced to nitrite the bio toxic nitrite was excreted extracellular and then reacted with ferrous ion to realize fenir in summary an improvement of fenir efficiency was obviously observed with acetate as co substrate a previous research showed high fenir rate at 0 7 kg n m3 d but this high rate only remained stable for 18 days and finally the rate decreased to 0 22 kg n m3 d 6 in this study with acetate as co substrate the fenir rate remained stable at 0 51 kg n m3 d for 40 days hence using acetate as co substrate benefited the fenir process in the removal of pollutants 3 2 sludge characteristics with co substrate cultivation in order to reveal the mechanism of fenir efficiency improvement by co substrate the characteristics of fenir sludge sampled on day 1 8 20 28 and 45 were determined and described below 3 2 1 the microbial community analysis the next generation sequencing technology ngs was used to analyze the microbial community in fenir sludge from fig 2 a the most predominant bacterial phylum in fenir sludge was proteobacteria which accounted for more than 50 at any time during the cultivation and along with time its proportion gradually increased another increase of proportion happened to acidobacteria from almost zero on day 1 to 7 73 on day 45 in contrast the proportion of firmicutes and actinobacteria decreased along with time for firmicutes the proportion decreased from 23 35 to 16 55 in 45 days while for actinobacteria it was from 12 27 to 1 25 fig 2 b showed the relative abundance of microbes at the genus level the predominant bacterial genus in fenir sludge was castellaniella clostridium sensu stricto 7 comamonas clostridium sensu stricto 10 thermomonas and rhodanobacter in order among them castellaniella comamonas thermomonas and rhodanobacter belong to proteobacteria and all of them are facultative heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria 16 22 the overall proportion of these five genera increased from 26 63 on day 1 to 45 85 on day 45 both clostridium sensu stricto 7 and clostridium sensu stricto 10 belong to firmicutes and they are obligate heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria 23 24 their overall proportion in sludge decreased a bit from 16 30 on day 1 to 13 37 on day 45 the lack of organics in influent was supposed to be the reason for the proportion decrease of obligate heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria 3 2 2 the active biomass content the combination of vss content and live cell percentage was used to characterize the active biomass content in the sludge along with the cultivation time the ss content the vss content and vss ss value in sludge were determined calculated and shown in fig 3 the ss content in sludge increased gradually while the vss content decreased resulting in the decrease of vss ss value this result was expected as the iron encrustation was formed around cells in fenir process and the density of iron encrustation was much higher than that of sludge 5 fig 4 a illustrates the change of the live cell percentage in fenir sludge along with the cultivation time the live cell percentage in fenir sludge decreased linearly from 78 2 on day 1 to 40 3 on day 45 by linear fitting the attenuation coefficient of live cell percentage in fenir sludge with acetate as co substrate was lower than that in fenir sludge without acetate as co substrate 0 8627 vs 1 0949 namely with acetate as co substrate the death of fenir cells slowed down 3 2 3 the specific fenir activity the specific fenir activity of granular sludge was determined by batch test and results were shown in fig 5 the specific fenir activity of inoculated sludge namely sample on day 1 was 1 71 mg n g vss h then along with time the specific fenir activity of sludge decreased and finally stabilized at around 0 73 mg n g vss h which was only 42 7 of the activity in sample on day 1 in contrast to vss content and live cell percentage the specific fenir activity did not show a linear decline trend with time instead the specific fenir activity of sludge remained stable after decreasing by half this was in consistent with the reactor performance described in section 3 1 3 2 4 the sludge morphology tem was used to observe the internal structure of microbial cells in all samples fig 6 even with acetate as co substrate iron encrustation was formed around cells but not around all cells the live cells without iron encrustation seemed to gather together and formed a barrier surrounding them to prevent iron from the outside the barrier clearly separated the encrusted cells and the un encrusted cells at the early stage of reactor operation cells within the barrier were hardly to be observed with iron encrustation and there was no iron precipitation within the barrier signifying the strong shielding effect of the barrier to ferrous ferric ion with the passage of time the cell group surrounded by the barrier became smaller and more cells were observed being attached with iron encrustation the barrier was supposed being damaged and the barrier effect was weakened the barrier was deduced as the extracellular polymer eps

ferrous ion ferric ion to go through the barrier this was the shielding effect of the barrier 25 26 according to the microbial community analysis of fenir sludge there were at least two kinds of denitrifer in the fenir reactor namely the facultative heterotrophic denitrifier and the obligate heterotrophic denitrifier however the autotrophic denitrifier could not be excluded even the inoculum was from the heterotrophic denitrification reactor the fenir mechanisms were reported to be diverse as not only autotrophic denitrifier and facultative heterotrophic denitrifier but also obligate heterotrophic denitrifier had the ability to perform fenir 9 27 28 for the autotrophic denitrifier and facultative heterotrophic denitrifier the ferrous ion donated electrons to the cytochrome c type

heterotrophic denitrifier they preferred to use acetate to reduce nitrate and reproduce because the heterotrophic denitrification yielded more energy comparing with the autotrophic denitrification 34 35 therefore the nitrate reduction rate was high in stage i section 3 1 as all three kinds of denitrifiers carried out fenir reaction the influent organic matter was insufficient to support a large number of heterotrophic bacteria resulting in less eps production and worse barrier function ferrous ion went through the barrier and the facultative heterotrophic denitrifier used ferrous ion as electron donor resulting in the formation of iron incrustation with the iron encrustation the activity of both the autotrophic denitrifier and the facultative heterotrophic denitrifier was inhibited thus resulting in the decrease of fenir efficiency at the reactor level in stage ii section 3 1 with less eps production and worse barrier function the original big cell group surrounded by the barrier broke up into several small cell groups fig 6 for the obligate heterotrophic denitrifier limited organic matter in the influent could not support their survival but they were detected by ngs and observed by tem in sample on day 42 the possible reason is the electron sparing a mechanism of iron oxidizers when co substrate was available as electron donor 31 the limited organics were used to reduce nitrate to nitrite then the nitrite was released outside the cell even outside the barrier that s why there was no iron encrustation around the obligate heterotrophic denitrifier to react with the ferrous ion more nitrate would be consumed in such a mechanism and an energetic benefit to the organism would be gained per mole of electron donor that s why nitrite was detected in the effluent during the reactor operation fig 1 c the outgoing nitrite met ferrous ion to produce gaseous nitrogen compounds and ferric ion accomplishing the fenir reaction 3 3 the mechanism of fenir efficiency improvement with acetate as co substrate with acetate as co substrate the fenir rate improved significantly by more than 2 times when comparing with the previous report of fenir rate without acetate as co substrate 0 51 kg n m3 d vs 0 22 kg n m3 d 6 that indicated co substrate benefited the fenir process to realize high efficiency moreover the high fenir efficiency with acetate as co substrate could maintain for more than 40 days without acetate as co substrate the fenir efficiency declined progressively along with time 6 using acetate as co substrate not only improved the fenir efficiency but also kept the high fenir efficiency stable the live cell percentage in sludge decreased linearly in 42 days but it was slower than that in sludge cultivated without acetate as co substrate that signified the co substrate cultivation slowed down the death rate of cells and thus maintained a high active biomass content in the sludge further the specific fenir activity of sludge was detected to be stable at about 0 73 mg n g vss h the high active biomass content and stable specific fenir activity ensured the fenir efficiency at high level from the microbial community analysis both facultative and obligate heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria existed in the fenir reactor during the whole operation with co substrate cultivation both heterotrophic denitrification and autotrophic

general process of heterotrophic denitrification as shown in fig 7 the other part of nitrite went outside of the cells to react with ferrous ion thus the corresponding electrons were spared and an energetic benefit happened to the obligate heterotrophic denitrifier with this energetic benefit and acetate as carbon source obligate heterotrophic denitrifier produced eps to build the barrier with
