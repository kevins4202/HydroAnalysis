heterogeneous distribution of microbial activities at the pore scale we conducted pore scale reactive transport simulations to investigate the scaling of microbially mediated consumption reaction

al 2018 in the present work we investigate the upscaling of microbially mediated reaction rates under various transport and reaction conditions reactive transport simulations resolving pore scale features are conducted using the lattice boltzmann method across a range of péclet and damköhler numbers then the volumetric reaction rates using pore scale concentrations are compared to upscaled reaction rates based on volume averaging or flux based mass balance methods based on the assessment of these two approaches we discuss an improved upscaled reaction rate estimate which incorporates reaction kinetics and diffusive fluxes into the flux based mass balance equation finally the effect of heterogeneous biomass distribution on upscaled reaction rates is assessed by comparing reaction rates for even and patchy distributions of microorganisms 2 methods 2 1 pore structure generation and biomass distribution a 2d model domain was created with the domain length of 1 cm l 0 5 cm consisting of 1000 500 nodes located at the center of grid voxels with 10 μm the pore geometry was generated using a sequential gaussian simulation algorithm with simple kriging and gaussian variogram remy et al 2009 a spatially correlated series of random values t r with a mean of 0 and variance of 1 was generated with a predefined integral scale 0 07 cm and assuming isotropy these random values were then converted into a binary porous medium χ r by applying a threshold γ 1 χ r 0 γ t r γ 1 else where r is a position vector and 0 and 1 represent pore space and solid respectively γ was adjusted to produce a porous medium close to the target porosity ϕ the generated domain was post processed to minimize mass balance errors by eliminating pore throats where the diameter is 3 pore voxels and pores enclosed by solids while maintaining the porosity of 0 7 six different biomass distributions were considered with biomass distributed evenly on the grain surfaces bf or in patches occupying 5 ag5 10 ag10 20 ag20 30 ag30 or 40 ag40 connected grid voxels fig 1 for bf all pore voxels sharing a surface with solid voxels were considered biomass voxels for ags biomass voxels were distributed by randomly selecting a pore voxel located on the solid surface initial seed subsequently adjacent pore voxels which were not neighboring any existing biomass clusters were randomly selected as additional biomass voxels until the predefined aggregate size was reached if the available pore space was insufficient either due to solid grains or other previously assigned biomass voxels the aggregate was discarded entirely this was repeated until the assigned biomass density of the whole domain ρ was reached each biomass voxel was assigned a local cell density ρ local cell density of ags was assumed to be 20 cells voxel based on the cell density of 20 cells 100 μm3 reported by drescher et al 2016 reflecting a characteristic cell size of 1 μm in the third dimension with an average cell density ρ of 4 105 cells cm2 e g representative of seafloor sediments 4 109 cells cm3 kallmeyer et al 2012 this resulted in 10 000 biomass voxels the local cell density of bf was set to 26 14 cells voxel in order to maintain the same ρ as the single coverage of all grain surfaces only resulted in 7652 biomass voxels 2 2 pore scale reactive transport simulation a pore scale reactive transport model was developed using the open source lattice boltzmann lb code palabos www palabos org instead of solving macroscopic equations directly the lb method discretizes the mesoscopic boltzmann equation across a limited number of particles 2 f i r c i δ t t δ t f i r t ω i mrt r t where the ith discrete set of particles f i r t travels with the lattice velocity c i to a new position r c i δt after a time step δt the particles are also affected by a collision operator ω i for which the multiple relaxation time mrt operator was chosen for its numerical stability and accuracy d humieres et al 2002 the mrt collision operator relaxes moments via a relaxation matrix s by mapping population to moment space through a transformation matrix m 3 ω mrt r t m 1 sm f r t f eq r t δ t with the equilibrium population function 4 f i eq r t ω i ρ p 1 u c i c s 2 u c i 2 2 c s 4 u u 2 c s 2 where ω i are the lattice weights ω 0 4 9 ω 1 4 1 9 ω 5 8 1 36 which correspond to each lattice velocity

u σ c i f i and c s is a lattice dependent constant here the gram schmidt relaxation and transformation matrices were used yu et al 2003 solute transport and biochemical reactions were simulated with a distribution function g using regularized lb method rlb this method replaces the incoming distribution function g i r t of the original bhatnagar gross krook lb model bhatnagar et al 1954 with its

and stability as it enforces the preservation of the non equilibrium part of the distribution function latt and chopard 2006 wang et al 2015 the d2q5 lattice was used for the transport distribution function g satisfying the isotropy requirement for the mass conservation huber et al 2014 kang et al 2002 for the reaction collision term in eq 5 the irreversible reaction c p with a first order dependence on the substrate concentration r kρc was considered so that 6 ω i rxn r t δ t ω i r δ t ω i kρc where ω i are the lattice weights ω 0 1 3 and ω 1 4 1 6 with the corresponding lattice

the time unit is reported as non dimensional fourier number fo dt λ 2 where d is diffusivity and λ is the characteristic length the chapman enskog analysis showed that the lb method recovers the incompressible navier stokes equations with the kinematic viscosity ν c s 2 τ 1 2 δ t and the advection diffusion reaction equation krüger et al 2017 the microbial reaction rate in this study was described by first order dependence on substrate concentration instead of michaelis menten kinetics that is commonly used to describe microbially mediated reactions implying low substrate concentrations the microbial densities were kept constant with time in all simulations as is the case when sources and sinks including e g cell growth decay attachment and detachment are in balance or if the timescale of microbial dynamics is long compared to the chemical and transport dynamics this is a reasonable approximation for conditions in which only a small fraction of the substrate utilizations fuels growth low growth efficiencies yet there is sufficient substrate to counterbalance viral lysis or other sinks of microbial biomass the fluid flow in the generated porous medium was induced by imposing fixed pressures at inlet x 0 and outlet x l with no flow at the top y l 2 and bottom y 0 boundaries while maintaining the low mach number condition for incompressible flow ma 1 no slip boundary conditions were imposed at the solid fluid and biomass fluid interfaces for the flow solver eq 2 with the bounce back algorithm ginzbourg and adler 1994 this is only first order accurate in space but provides flexibility as the boundary handling is independent of the orientation of the boundary walls which facilitates simulating fluid dynamics in porous media with complex geometry huber et al 2014 the reactant was injected at the inlet with the fixed concentration c in 1 and no gradient boundary condition was applied at the domain outlet for the solute transport eq 5 no slip boundary conditions were imposed only at the solid fluid interfaces allowing the solute to be transported through biomass grid voxels by diffusion the molecular diffusivity in biomass voxels was reduced to 80 of the solute diffusivity in pore spaces to account for the reduced diffusivity within biomass tang et al 2013 all simulations were run to steady state 2 3 macroscopic reaction rate estimates the effect of pore scale concentrations and heterogeneous biomass distribution was investigated by comparing the true volumetric rate r t determined from pore scale substrate concentrations and microbial distribution to rate estimates utilizing different information available at the macroscopic scale for a first order microbially mediated reaction 7 r t kρcdv vϕ where v is the volume of the entire domain ϕ is porosity ρ and c are the local cell density and dimensionless substrate concentration respectively however pore scale concentrations and the distribution of microorganisms are usually not known and hence may be approximated by the macroscopically measurable average concentration and cell density assuming the same rate expression applies at both the macro and pore scale this leads to a concentration based rate estimate r 1 of 8 r 1 k ρ c where c is the volume average xdv vϕ of local substrate concentration calculated from pore scale simulation results alternatively when the volumetric flow rate is known the reaction rate in a defined volume can be estimated by comparing changes in advective fluxes yielding a flux based reaction rate estimate r 2 of 9 r 2 q v c in c out vϕ where q v is the volumetric flow rate c in is the solute concentration of the injected fluid and c out is the flux weighted solute concentration calculated as 10 c out c u d s u d s where s is the surface normal vector at the outlet and u is the velocity vector the mass balance approach of eq 9 depends only on advective fluxes which is applicable when diffusive fluxes are negligible we expand this mass balance approach by including macroscopic estimates of diffusive fluxes which results in 11 q v c in d a c l 2 c in c q v c out d a c l 2 c c out r 3 l a c ϕ where l is the domain length a c is the cross sectional area for diffusion across the domain boundaries and r 3 is the macroscopic rate estimate expressed as a function of c applying the rate law of this study r 3 k ρ c and solving eq 11 for c gives 12 c u d l d c in c out 2 c in c out 4 ϕk ρ l 2 d from which r 3 k ρ c can be computed easily using péclet pe eq 14 and diffusive damköhler da d eq 16 numbers which quantify the relative importance of advection vs diffusion and reaction vs diffusive transport respectively the reaction rate can be expressed by macroscopically accessible quantities as 13 r 3 da d d λ lpe c in c out 2 λ c in c out 4 λ 2 da d ϕ l 2 the effect of heterogeneous biomass distribution on upscaled reaction rates is explored for a range of péclet numbers pe 0 01 0 1 1 advective da a 0 01

length scale set to the average pore diameter 294 μm 3 results and discussion 3 1 fluid flow and solute distribution the simulated flow field revealed large variations in pore velocities fig 1b ranging from almost no advective flow at dead end pores e g u u max 4 10 15 at location 1 to fast advection along preferential flow paths e g u u max 0 42 at location 2 in general the generated pore geometry for a porosity ϕ 0 7 resulted in high sediment permeability values calculated as κ u d νρ p p table 1 the potential of biomass to affect fluid flow has been observed in many laboratory experiments carrel et al 2018 tang et al 2013 thullner et al 2002 our pore scale simulations showed that biomass aggregates of larger sizes can impede fluid flows more effectively than smaller aggregates as shown in fig 1c h and reflecting the calculated permeabilities table 1 consistent with other modeling studies coyte et al 2017 tartakovsky et al 2009 thullner et al 2002 however under the high ϕ and κ conditions considered here the differences in flow fields over the entire domain for different biomass distribution were small 23 variation in κ various transport and reaction conditions in porous media were investigated as reflected in the values of pe da a and da d fig 2 shows that pe and da a determine the heterogeneity of vertical and horizontal concentrations respectively the difference in pore scale concentrations perpendicular to the main flow direction was small at low pe but was large at high pe as advection became important for instance the concentration difference between locations 1 and 2 was 0 24 at pe 0 01 fig 2b and this difference increased to 0 49 and 0 89 as pe increased to 0 1 fig 2e and 1 fig 2h respectively in contrast the pore concentrations along the main flow direction were governed by da a with only small differences at low da a but large differences at high da a for example the difference in concentration between locations 2 and 3 was 0 05 at da a 0 01 fig 2a and increased to 0 37 at da a 0 1 fig 2b and 0 65 at da a 1 fig 2c the magnitude of reaction relative to diffusion expressed by the diffusive damköhler number da d is a measure of the variability of the substrate concentration within individual pores the concentration gradient within a pore becomes more heterogeneous at a higher da d because fast reaction outcompetes diffusion which acts to remove concentration gradients for example the concentration gradient in a pore near location 4 increased as da d increased from 0 01 fig 2c to 0 1 fig 2f and 1 fig 2i respectively this faster consumption of a substrate at a higher da d led to the reduced downstream concentration at a domain scale if diffusion is the dominant transport mechanism when pe 1 the concentration at location 3 was reduced from 0 03 at da d pe 0 01 fig 2c to 0 002 at da d pe 0 1 fig 2f however as the dominant transport mechanism transitioned from diffusion to advection well connected pore channels exhibited persistent high substrate levels and resulted in significant spatial heterogeneity in pore scale concentrations compare the panels in each row of fig 2 as a result the downstream concentration at location 4 increased to 0 04 because advective transport became important pe da d 1 despite the highest da d condition of this study 3 2 upscaled reaction rates the volumetric reaction rate r t eq 7 was quantified for a range of pe da a and da d fig 3a the result showed positive correlation between r t and both pe and da a and hence their product da d which demonstrates that r t is high when there is either high advection i e high pe or high microbial activities i e high kρ fig 3b shows that applying the volume averaged concentration and cell density r 1 eq 8 overestimates the macroscopic reaction rate r 1 r t 1 the difference between r 1 and r t was largely negligible when da d 0 01 because of the relatively uniform pore scale concentrations while the difference became large at da d 0 01 fig 2 for ag30 at da d 1 pe da a 1 in fig 3 applying the average concentration c 0 162 to all the microorganisms within the domain eq 8 resulted in a 3 fold overestimation of r 1 fig 3b in contrast r 2 underestimated the macroscopic rates fig 3c indicating that either the influx was underestimated or the efflux was overestimated indeed r 2 does not account for the diffusive exchange across the domain boundaries and thus led to the observed dependence of r 2 r t on pe therefore significant underestimation of r 2 was observed at pe 0 01 while the estimates improved at higher pe due to the reduced relative importance of diffusion applying this reasoning to production reactions which increase the concentrations as opposed to the consumption processes modeled here one expects a diffusive loss instead of a gain across the inflow boundary this results in overestimation of flux based upscaled production reaction rates consistent with the findings of li et al 2006 and molins et al 2014 in addition diffusive effluxes at the outlet boundary which is not the case in our simulations where a no gradient condition was imposed would prompt an underestimate of the mass leaving the domain and lead to an overestimation of r 2 therefore the accuracy of r 2 depends on the balance between diffusive influxes and effluxes after accounting for the diffusive fluxes r 3 indeed showed significant improvement over r 2 especially at low pe where diffusion dominated over advection fig 3d despite the overall improvement most r 3 still underestimated the reactivity except 1 of overestimation at pe 1 and da a 0 01 underestimation of r 3 became apparent at da d 0 01 and especially at da a 1 as c failed to capture fast reactions near the inlet see fig 2 3 3 the effect of heterogeneous biomass distribution to investigate the effect of heterogeneous biomass distributions on macroscopic rates additional simulations were run at pe da a da d 1 fig 4 the ensemble average of r t r t generally showed a positive correlation with permeability because the delivery of the reactant governs the reaction rate fig 4a the variability in r t and κ κbm tends to increase as the size of aggregates increases because increasing individual aggregate sizes decrease the number of cell clusters and introduce more variability in cluster locations r 1 3 r t showed increasing trends with larger aggregate size lower κ κbm as a consequence of the reduced r t fig 4b and c lower consumption rates imply larger volume averaged c and flux weighted concentrations c out a higher c led to a higher r 1 eq 8 hence r 1 r t increased as aggregate sizes increase fig 4b the effect of increased aggregates size on r 2 r t and r 3 r t was similar though r 3 r t were consistently closer to unity than r 2 r t fig 4c the flux based estimates showed less variability to the different sizes of biomass aggregates than r 1 r t since the increased c out by large aggregates lower r 2 and r 3 as well as r t eqs 9 and 13 for example r 2 and r 3 decreased 0 33 and 0 29 respectively while r t also decreased 0 81 from ag10 to ag20 however r 2 r t and r 3 r t still exhibited an increasing trend with the increasing size of aggregates due to the larger reduction in r t than in r 2 or r 3 the increase in r 1 3 r t with aggregate size indicates that larger aggregates increased the overestimation of r t by r 1 while it reduced the underestimation by r 2 and r 3 for consumption reactions for production reactions or when diffusive effluxes exceed influxes however heterogeneous biomass distribution will have the opposite effect as biomass aggregates become larger product concentrations within the domain decrease because of the reduced r t this leads to the reduction in scaling errors caused by diffusive effluxes in mass balance approaches therefore the ratio of upscaled reaction rates to r t for production reactions will show decreasing trends and decreasing scaling errors as a consequence of the increased aggregate sizes 3 4 summary and perspectives we have presented the upscaling of microbially mediated consumption reaction rates under various pe da a and da d conditions in porous media with heterogeneous biomass distribution the macroscopic rates using volume averaged concentrations r 1 overestimated the volumetric consumption rate r t in contrast the flux based approach r 2 underestimated the system reactivity as it ignored diffusive fluxes across domain boundaries the mass balance equation can be improved by including diffusive fluxes and knowledge on the reaction kinetics as shown here for a linear rate law r 3 but potentially extensible to more complex expressions the effect of heterogeneous biomass distribution became apparent when da d 0 01 and it enhanced the discrepancy between r 1 and r t while it reduced the differences between r 2 or r 3 and r t however the effect is rather small as the porous media only differ in the size and distribution of microbial aggregates but not in the solid phase distribution which at the high porosity studied here results in similar pore connectivities and substrate distributions the scaling errors observed in the flux based approach are attributed to diffusive fluxes unaccounted for or incorrectly captured in the mass balance equations however mass balance approaches are often used in aquifer studies or for experiments where strong pressure gradients are imposed audigane et al 2007 gaus et al 2005 in these cases diffusive fluxes and the associated flux based scaling errors are negligible steefel and lichtner 1994 thus the errors in mass balance approaches should be attributed to other factors including reaction affinities for reversible reactions hellmann and tisserand 2006 maher et al 2009 surface passivation gin et al 2015 putnis et al 1995 and microbial dynamics unaccounted for in simplified model representations king et al 2010 stolpovsky et al 2012 tartakovsky et al 2013 two dimensional approaches often fail to capture important features of heterogeneous 3d porous media such as preferential flow paths gautier and noetinger 1997 or small pore throats that contribute to permeability beckingham et al 2013 however the influence of heterogeneous porous media decreases significantly as porosity increases beckingham 2017 which indicates dominant flow features may be represented relatively well by 2d simplification in high porosity conditions with low biomass concentrations as discussed here in low porosity media however even thin biofilms can reduce κ and r t significantly by clogging the pore throats with small diameters which will be intensified by aggregated microorganisms abdel aal et al 2010 baveye et al 1998 ham et al 2007 kanmani et al 2014 in highly active environments for example in bioremediation efforts biomass in porous media can dynamically interact with fluid flow and occupy 20 35 of the pore volume surasani et al 2013 thullner et al 2004 giving rise to 2 3 orders of magnitude reduction in κ cunningham et al 1991 seifert and engesgaard 2007 thullner 2010 in such cases where biomass is dynamic and affects flow paths substantially scaling effects may differ from the results reported in this study their quantification will require resolving the complex feedback between microbial dynamics and fluid flow in heterogeneous porous media we expect that upscaled rate estimates can be improved by using scaling factors e g α in meile and tuncay 2006 f in deng et al 2018 that are

incompressible navier stokes equations with the kinematic viscosity ν c s 2 τ 1 2 δ t and the advection diffusion reaction equation krüger et al 2017 the microbial reaction rate in this study was described by first order dependence on substrate concentration instead of michaelis menten kinetics that is commonly used to describe microbially mediated reactions implying low substrate concentrations the microbial densities were kept constant with time in all simulations as is the case when sources and sinks including e g cell growth decay attachment and detachment are in balance or if the timescale of microbial dynamics is long compared to the chemical and transport dynamics this is a reasonable approximation for conditions in which only a small fraction of the substrate utilizations fuels growth low growth efficiencies yet there is sufficient substrate to counterbalance viral lysis or other sinks of microbial biomass the fluid flow in the generated porous medium was induced by imposing fixed pressures at inlet x 0 and outlet x l with no flow at the top y l 2 and bottom y 0 boundaries while maintaining the low mach number condition for incompressible flow ma 1 no slip boundary conditions were imposed at the solid fluid and biomass fluid interfaces for the flow solver eq 2 with the bounce back algorithm ginzbourg and adler 1994 this is only first order accurate in space but provides flexibility as the boundary handling is independent of the orientation of the boundary walls which facilitates simulating fluid dynamics in porous media with complex geometry huber et al 2014 the reactant was injected at the inlet with the fixed concentration c in 1 and no gradient boundary condition was applied at the domain outlet for the solute transport eq 5 no slip boundary conditions were imposed only at the solid fluid interfaces allowing the solute to be transported through biomass grid voxels by diffusion the molecular diffusivity in biomass voxels was reduced to 80 of the solute diffusivity in pore spaces to account for the reduced diffusivity within biomass tang et al 2013 all simulations were run to steady state 2 3 macroscopic reaction rate estimates the effect of pore scale concentrations and heterogeneous biomass distribution was investigated by comparing the true volumetric rate r t determined from pore scale substrate concentrations and microbial distribution to rate estimates utilizing different information available at the macroscopic scale for a first order microbially mediated reaction 7 r t kρcdv vϕ where v is the volume of the entire domain ϕ is porosity ρ and c are the local cell density and dimensionless substrate concentration respectively however pore scale concentrations and the distribution of microorganisms are usually not known and hence may be approximated by the macroscopically measurable average concentration and cell density assuming the same rate expression applies at both the macro and pore scale this leads to a concentration based rate estimate r 1 of 8 r 1 k ρ c where c is the volume average xdv vϕ of local substrate concentration calculated from pore scale simulation results alternatively when the volumetric flow rate is known the reaction rate in a defined volume can be estimated by comparing changes in advective fluxes yielding a flux based reaction rate estimate r 2 of 9 r 2 q v c in c out vϕ where q v is the volumetric flow rate c in is the solute concentration of the injected fluid and c out is the flux weighted solute concentration calculated as 10 c out c u d s u d s where s is the surface normal vector at the outlet and u is the velocity vector the mass balance approach of eq 9 depends only on advective fluxes which is applicable when diffusive fluxes are negligible we expand this mass balance approach by including macroscopic estimates of diffusive fluxes which results in 11 q v c in d a c l 2 c in c q v c out d a c l 2 c c out r 3 l a c ϕ where l is the domain length a c is the cross sectional area for diffusion across the domain boundaries and r 3 is the macroscopic rate estimate expressed as a function of c applying the rate law of this study r 3 k ρ c

quantify the relative importance of advection vs diffusion and reaction vs diffusive transport respectively the reaction rate can be expressed by macroscopically accessible quantities as 13 r 3 da d d

length scale set to the average pore diameter 294 μm 3 results and discussion 3 1 fluid flow and solute distribution the simulated flow field revealed large variations in pore velocities fig 1b ranging from almost no advective flow at dead end pores e g u u max 4 10 15 at location 1 to fast advection along preferential flow paths e g u u max 0 42 at location 2 in general the generated pore geometry for a porosity ϕ 0 7 resulted in high sediment permeability values calculated as κ u d νρ p p table 1 the potential of biomass to affect fluid flow has been observed in many laboratory experiments carrel et al 2018 tang et al 2013 thullner et al 2002 our pore scale simulations showed that biomass aggregates of larger sizes can impede fluid flows more effectively than smaller aggregates as shown in fig 1c h and reflecting the calculated permeabilities table 1 consistent with other modeling studies coyte et al 2017 tartakovsky et al 2009 thullner et al 2002 however under the high ϕ and κ conditions considered here the differences in flow fields over the entire domain for different biomass distribution were small 23 variation in κ various transport and reaction conditions in porous media were investigated as reflected in the values of pe da a and da d fig 2 shows that pe and da a determine the heterogeneity of vertical and horizontal concentrations respectively the difference in pore scale concentrations perpendicular to the main flow direction was small at low pe but was large at high pe as advection became important for instance the concentration difference between locations 1 and 2 was 0 24 at pe 0 01 fig 2b and this difference increased to 0 49 and 0 89 as pe increased to 0 1 fig 2e and 1 fig 2h respectively in contrast the pore concentrations along the main flow direction were governed by da a with only small differences at low da a but large differences at high da a for example the difference in concentration between locations 2 and 3 was 0 05 at da a 0 01 fig 2a and increased to 0 37 at da a 0 1 fig 2b and 0 65 at da a 1 fig 2c the magnitude of reaction relative to diffusion expressed by the diffusive damköhler number da d is a measure of the variability of the substrate concentration within individual pores the concentration gradient within a pore becomes more heterogeneous at a higher da d because fast reaction outcompetes diffusion which acts to remove concentration gradients for example the concentration gradient in a pore near location 4 increased as da d increased from 0 01 fig 2c to 0 1 fig 2f and 1 fig 2i respectively this faster consumption of a substrate at a higher da d led to the reduced downstream concentration at a domain scale if diffusion is the dominant transport mechanism when pe 1 the concentration at location 3 was reduced from 0 03 at da d pe 0 01 fig 2c to 0 002 at da d pe 0 1 fig 2f however as the dominant transport mechanism transitioned from diffusion to advection well connected pore channels exhibited persistent high substrate levels and resulted in significant spatial heterogeneity in pore scale concentrations compare the panels in each row of fig 2 as a result the downstream concentration at location 4 increased to 0 04 because advective transport became important pe da d 1 despite the highest da d condition of this study 3 2 upscaled reaction rates the volumetric reaction rate r t eq 7 was quantified for a range of pe da a and da d fig 3a the result showed positive correlation between r t and both pe and da a and hence their product da d which demonstrates that r t is high when there is either high advection i e high pe or high microbial activities i e high kρ fig 3b shows that applying the volume averaged concentration and cell density r 1 eq 8 overestimates the macroscopic reaction rate r 1 r t 1 the difference between r 1 and r t was largely negligible when da d 0 01 because of the relatively uniform pore scale concentrations while the difference became large at da d 0 01 fig 2 for ag30 at da d 1 pe da a 1 in fig 3 applying the average concentration c 0 162 to all the microorganisms within the domain eq 8 resulted in a 3 fold overestimation of r 1 fig 3b in contrast r 2 underestimated the macroscopic rates fig 3c indicating that either the influx was underestimated or the efflux was overestimated indeed r 2 does not account for the diffusive exchange across the domain boundaries and thus led to the observed dependence of r 2 r t on pe therefore significant underestimation of r 2 was observed at pe 0 01 while the estimates improved at higher pe due to the reduced relative importance of diffusion applying this reasoning to production reactions which increase the concentrations as opposed to the consumption processes modeled here one expects a diffusive loss instead of a gain across the inflow boundary this results in overestimation of flux based upscaled production reaction rates consistent with the findings of li et al 2006 and molins et al 2014 in addition diffusive effluxes at the outlet boundary which is not the case in our simulations where a no gradient condition was imposed would prompt an underestimate of the mass leaving the domain and lead to an overestimation of r 2 therefore the accuracy of r 2 depends on the balance between diffusive influxes and effluxes after accounting for the diffusive fluxes r 3 indeed showed significant improvement over r 2 especially at low pe where diffusion dominated over advection fig 3d despite the overall improvement most r 3 still underestimated the reactivity except 1 of overestimation at pe 1 and da a 0 01 underestimation of r 3 became apparent at da d 0 01 and especially at da a 1 as c failed to capture fast reactions near the inlet see fig 2 3 3 the effect of heterogeneous biomass distribution to investigate the effect of heterogeneous biomass distributions on macroscopic rates additional simulations were run at pe da a da d 1 fig 4 the ensemble average of r t r t generally showed a positive correlation with permeability because the delivery of the reactant governs the reaction rate fig 4a the variability in r t and κ κbm tends to increase as the size of aggregates increases because increasing individual aggregate sizes decrease the number of cell clusters and introduce more variability in cluster locations r 1 3 r t showed increasing trends with larger aggregate size lower κ κbm as a consequence of the reduced r t fig 4b and c lower consumption rates imply larger volume averaged c and flux weighted concentrations c out a higher c led to a higher r 1 eq 8 hence r 1 r t increased as aggregate sizes increase fig 4b the effect of increased aggregates size on r 2 r t and r 3 r t was similar though r 3 r t were consistently closer to unity than r 2 r t fig 4c the flux based estimates showed less variability to the different sizes of biomass aggregates than r 1 r t since the increased c out by large aggregates lower r 2 and r 3 as well as r t eqs 9 and 13 for example r 2 and r 3 decreased 0 33 and 0 29 respectively while r t also decreased 0 81 from ag10 to ag20 however r 2 r t and r 3 r t still exhibited an increasing trend with the increasing size of aggregates due to the larger reduction in r t than in r 2 or r 3 the increase in r 1 3 r t with aggregate size indicates that larger aggregates increased the overestimation of r t by r 1 while it reduced the underestimation by r 2 and r 3 for consumption reactions for production reactions or when diffusive effluxes exceed influxes however heterogeneous biomass distribution will have the opposite effect as biomass aggregates become larger product concentrations within the domain decrease because of the reduced r t this leads to the reduction in scaling errors caused by diffusive effluxes in mass balance approaches therefore the ratio of upscaled reaction rates to r t for production reactions will show decreasing trends and decreasing scaling errors as a consequence of the increased aggregate sizes 3 4 summary and perspectives we have presented the upscaling of microbially mediated consumption reaction rates under various pe da a and da d conditions in porous media with heterogeneous biomass distribution the macroscopic rates using volume averaged concentrations r 1 overestimated the volumetric consumption rate r t in contrast the flux based approach r 2 underestimated the system reactivity as it ignored diffusive fluxes across domain boundaries the mass balance equation can be improved by including diffusive fluxes and knowledge on the reaction kinetics as shown here for a linear rate law r 3 but potentially extensible to more complex expressions the effect of heterogeneous biomass distribution became apparent when da d 0 01 and it enhanced the discrepancy between r 1 and r t while it reduced the differences between r 2 or r 3 and r t however the effect is rather small as the porous media only differ in the size and distribution of microbial aggregates but not in the solid phase distribution which at the high porosity studied here results in similar pore connectivities and substrate distributions the scaling errors observed in the flux based approach are attributed to diffusive fluxes unaccounted for or incorrectly captured in the mass balance equations however mass balance approaches are often used in aquifer studies or for experiments where strong pressure gradients are imposed audigane et al 2007 gaus et al 2005 in these cases diffusive fluxes and the associated flux based scaling errors are negligible steefel and lichtner 1994 thus the errors in mass balance approaches should be attributed to other factors including reaction affinities for reversible reactions hellmann and tisserand 2006 maher et al 2009 surface passivation gin et al 2015 putnis et al 1995 and microbial dynamics unaccounted for in simplified model representations king et al 2010 stolpovsky et al 2012 tartakovsky et al 2013 two dimensional approaches often fail to capture important features of heterogeneous 3d porous media such as preferential flow paths gautier and noetinger 1997 or small pore throats that contribute to permeability beckingham et al 2013 however the influence of heterogeneous porous media decreases significantly as porosity increases beckingham 2017 which indicates dominant flow features may be represented relatively well by 2d simplification in high porosity conditions with low biomass concentrations as discussed here in low porosity media however even thin biofilms can reduce κ and r t significantly by clogging the pore throats with small diameters which will be intensified by aggregated microorganisms abdel aal et al 2010 baveye et al 1998 ham et al 2007 kanmani et al 2014 in highly active environments for example in bioremediation efforts biomass in porous media can dynamically interact with fluid flow and occupy 20 35 of the pore volume surasani et al 2013 thullner et al 2004 giving rise to 2 3 orders of magnitude reduction in κ cunningham et al 1991 seifert and engesgaard 2007 thullner 2010 in such cases where biomass is dynamic and affects flow paths substantially scaling effects may differ from the results reported in this study their quantification will require resolving the complex feedback between microbial dynamics and fluid flow in heterogeneous porous media we expect that upscaled rate estimates can be improved by using scaling factors e g α in meile and tuncay 2006 f in deng et al 2018 that are

1581,scope is scalar transport in enhanced subsurface flows driven by injection and extraction wells two transport problems of great practical relevance viz i rapid scalar extraction and ii contained in situ processing are investigated in terms of the thermal transport in a two dimensional circular subsurface reservoir with a well driven darcy type flow lagrangian fluid transport is key to these problems and thus the notion of lagrangian coherent structures lcss is adopted for analysis and engineering purposes analysis by this approach of heat scalar extraction reveals that a basic pumping scheme involving a static injector extractor pair invariably outperforms more elaborate schemes using time periodic actuation of multiple well pairs due to the formation of special lcss that retard heat release such lcss are on the other hand well suited for contained in situ processing lcss namely are fundamentally embedded in the thermal scalar transport and given they admit rapid and accurate control by the pumping scheme thus naturally emerge as internal actuators for the creation of dynamic processing zones and reaction fronts this principle has been developed into an lcs based in situ processing strategy to this end the non trivial link between thermal and lagrangian transport is rigorously established via methods from dynamical systems theory so as to enable systematic demarcation and characterisation of confinement zones and their interaction with the wells for the generic case of diffusion the framework thus developed is demonstrated by way of examples keywords subsurface scalar transport in situ recovery remediation lagrangian coherent structures dynamic mode decomposition reservoir management 1 introduction scope of the study is scalar transport in enhanced subsurface flows driven by injection and extraction wells this principle finds application in for example enhanced geothermal systems egss chen and wyborn 2009 pruess 2006 brown et al 2012 chen and jiang 2015 in situ recovery of minerals or oil dreisinger 2006 seredkin et al 2016 guo et al 2016 and groundwater remediation cunningham and reinhard 2002 hoelen et al 2006 goltz and christ 2012 and essentially always concerns one of two problems i rapid extraction of a subsurface scalar e g heat or contaminants or ii in situ processing and remediation e g of groundwater the latter problem can be differentiated into two subclasses first in situ processing by the continuous throughflow of a circulating production fluid through the region of interest bounded by fixed geological or man made barriers subsurface recovery of e g minerals or metals adopts this approach so called leaching solutions are injected via the production fluid and after take up of the dissolved substance of interest treated in an extraction plant dreisinger 2006 seredkin et al 2016 second in situ processing by the creation of a contained subsurface processing zone i e without continuous throughflow of a production fluid across its boundary groundwater remediation by so called permeable reactive treatment zones relies on this principle permeable reactive barriers demarcate such zones and simultaneously act as i reaction front for water treatment and ii partial transport barrier by admitting passage only to clean groundwater and holding the contaminants goltz and christ 2012 morrison et al 2003 stroo 2010 gillham and vogan 2012 lagrangian fluid transport is key to the above problems due to their generically advection dominated nature péclet numbers typically are in the range pe 103 yet dedicated lagrangian studies to date primarily concern in situ processing by circulating production fluids these studies aim at efficient distribution and subsurface mixing of e g leaching solutions or water disinfection agents and successfully adopt the lagrangian concept of chaotic advection to accomplish this goal bagtzoglou and oates 2007 lester et al 2009 metcalfe et al 2010a metcalfe et al 2010b trefry et al 2012 mays and neupauer 2012 piscopo et al 2013 neupauer et al 2014 varghese et al 2017 rodriguez escales et al 2017 such insights are beyond investigations relying solely on eulerian flow and scalar fields dedicated lagrangian approaches towards subsurface scalar extraction and contained in situ processing on the other hand are practically non existent lagrangian like studies include investigation of resource extraction via the propagating front between depleted and resource rich region e g the thermal front in egss and creation of contained in situ processing zones and or transport barriers by subsurface streamline patterns of well driven recirculation flows goltz and christ 2012 however none of the known studies on transport involving said extraction and or containment save a first onset to in situ processing in trefry et al 2012 explicitly incorporates lagrangian transport physics despite the proven worth for subsurface mixing in bagtzoglou and oates 2007 lester et al 2009 metcalfe et al 2010a metcalfe et al 2010b trefry et al 2012 mays and neupauer 2012 piscopo et al 2013 neupauer et al 2014 varghese et al 2017 rodriguez escales et al 2017 to deepen insights and or develop new concepts for subsurface flow engineering this motivates the present study the current study adopts the geometric perspective towards lagrangian fluid transport by describing and investigating this through the geometry topology of the lagrangian fluid trajectories i e the lagrangian flow topology which is composed of elementary structures denoted lagrangian coherent structures lcss haller 2015 aref et al 2017 lcss offer fundamental insights in the transport phenomena and have found successful application in a wide range of transport studies aref et al 2017 metcalfe et al 2012 including the beforementioned in situ processing based on chaotic advection 1 1 a further development of the concept of chaotic advection specifically in the context of subsurface and porous media flows exists in the continuous time random walk of lagrangian fluid parcels this in essence concerns chaotic advection induced by the spatial micro structure of the porous medium and may in conjunction with diffusion yield highly non trivial scalar transport berkowitz et al n d neuman and tartakovsky 2009 dentz et al 2011 lester et al 2016 dentz et al 2016 principal goal of the following study expanding on a first onset in trefry et al 2012 is extension of this lagrangian approach to the other two subsurface transport problems identified above viz i rapid scalar extraction and ii contained in situ processing for in depth transport analyses and exploration of lcs based subsurface flow engineering lcss namely define natural building blocks for the systematic creation of dynamic processing zones transport barriers and reaction fronts and thus offer promising alternatives to conventional methods the latter typically are laborious and inflexible by creating static zone boundaries via a variety of techniques including injection of reactants establishment of ice walls or construction of infiltration trenches morrison et al 2003 stroo 2010 gillham and vogan 2012 ryan et al 2010 zendehboudi and bahadori 2017 lcss on the other hand emerge naturally in subsurface flow systems and admit rapid and accurate control by the pumping scheme 2 2 consider as proof of concept e g the active stabilisation of vortex patterns lauret et al 2013 the two transport problems of interest are without loss of generality examined in terms of the thermal transport in a two dimensional 2d circular subsurface reservoir with a darcy type flow driven by injection extraction wells on its perimeter pumping schemes are considered that yield both steady and time periodic flows so as to create transport conditions representative of a wide range of practical systems the problem definition and employed methods for its computational analysis are detailed in section 2 problem class i viz rapid heat extraction is investigated in section 3 key issue is determining whether elaborate pumping schemes may accelerate extraction section 4 addresses problem class ii viz contained in situ processing and develops a framework for the systematic creation of dynamic processing zones by lcss in the generic case of diffusion conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 problem definition and theoretical framework 2 1 flow and thermal transport model the study concerns fluid and thermal transport in a two dimensional 2d circular subsurface reservoir of radius r where the flow is driven by injection and extraction wells positioned on its perimeter the reservoir consists of an isotropic porous medium characterised by porosity φ and permeability k in which the darcy velocity u is governed by the well known brinkman equation nield and bejan 2006 that assuming typical reservoir conditions as per table 1 reduces to the darcy equation 1 u μ 1 k p with μ the fluid viscosity and p the pressure varghese et al 2017 3 3 velocities can vary widely from v o 0 1 1 m day o 10 6 10 5 m s in groundwater flows stroo 2010 kitanidis 2012 up to v o m hr o 10 3 m s in

1b e g corresponds with θ n 3π 4 8 the reoriented flow is following metcalfe et al 2010a varghese et al 2017 denoted rotated potential mixing rpm flow hereafter the present study adopts the local thermal equilibrium lte model to describe the heat transfer which is a common approach for darcy type porous media nield and bejan 2006 watanabe et al 2010 shaik et al 2011 rees et al 2008 the lte model assumes thermal equilibrium between the solid and fluid phases implying one global temperature t x t governed by the energy equation 3 ρc m t t ρc f u t k m 2 t with mean volumetric heat capacity ρc m and thermal conductivity k m given by 4 ρc m 1 φ ρc s φ ρc f k m 1 φ k s φ k f where subscripts s and f refer to solid and fluid phase respectively ρ is the density and c is the specific heat nield and bejan 2006 note c p c v c for incompressible fluids the lte model is completed by the uniform high initial temperature t x 0 t h and the low inlet temperature t c t h at the active injector the remaining boundary is adiabatic thus heat extraction occurs through the active extractor well via the enthalpy flux associated with the outflow 2 2 non dimensional model and system parameters the mathematical model 1 and 3 is non dimensionalised by adopting the following scaling for physical quantities primes indicate non dimensional quantities 5 x r x u u u 2 v v v 2 p pp t τt

the reservoir parameters in table 1 yield τ 20 days thus t 1 corresponds to an operating time of t 20 days on the reservoir scale which is practically implementable parameter ϑ is the non dimensional inlet temperature that in general equals ϑ 0 yet for computational reasons here is set at the small non zero value ϑ 10 4 this can be done without loss of generality substituting 5 into the above model yields the non dimensional darcy equation v u p revealing that true and darcy velocities identify in the non dimensional representation varghese et al 2017 and the non dimensional lte model 6 t

governing the system becomes φ θ t π pe the porosity is fixed at φ 0 1 in accordance with table 1 and the present study besides the base flow considers two well configurations namely θ n 2π 3 3 and θ n 3π 4 8 denoted 3 step flow and 8 step flow hereafter the latter adequately capture the lagrangian dynamics of generic rpm flows for step durations 1 t 4 metcalfe et al 2010a varghese et al 2017 relevant ranges for π and pe are demarcated below the thermophysical properties of water ρ f 1000 kg m3 c f 4200 j kg k k f 0 6 w m k in conjunction with those of a porous matrix consisting of rock in

yields for typical reservoir conditions as per table 1 characteristic non dimensional thermophysical parameters following table 2 this gives π o 0 1 and pe o 10 2 106 as typical orders of magnitude hence the present study considers fixed π 0 1 and variable pe in the range 102 pe 106 note that primes indicating non dimensional quantities are dropped for brevity below 2 3 numerical simulation of flow and heat transfer the non dimensional darcy equation and lte model are resolved using the commercial cfd package fluent this adopts essentially the same procedure as in varghese et al 2017 by prescribing inlet velocities according to the analytical solution of the rpm flow for isotropic reservoirs numerical complications inherent in explicitly including the point sources sinks that represent the injection extraction wells in this approach are prevented by modelling the latter as arcs with radius r 0 0 1r minor difference with the ansatz in varghese et al 2017 is that here all wells instead of only the active ones are thus incorporated this results in an indented circular perimeter following fig 1c and in consequence a flow domain invariant to reorientation shown velocity field is the base flow satisfying 1 for a dirichlet boundary condition on the injector well described by said analytical solution a standard outflow condition on the extractor well and no slip

evolution and define the so called eigenmodes essentially similar to the fourier decomposition of e g an audio signal into a superposition of elementary waves the spectrum admits ordering as ℜ μ 1 ℜ μ 0 0 implying an exponential decay for each mode with characteristic time τ k 1 ℜ μ k where existence of a non trivial steady state yields μ 0 0 thus eigenmodes generically exhibit damped oscillations with an angular frequency ω k that except for special cases exhibiting mode locking is asynchronous with the periodicity of the rpm flow the mode wise exponential decay at different time scales

et al 2017 metcalfe et al 2012 lester et al 2008 baskan et al 2015 2 4 2 state space representation of lagrangian and thermal transport lagrangian motion of passive tracers by the flow u can be described as a mapping 9 z t ℱ t z 0 with z t and z 0 the current and initial tracer positions respectively positions are for brevity given in complex notation z x i y in the context of state space representations this enables representation of the global lagrangian transport as the lagrangian motion of an infinite set of passive tracers released at initial positions z 0 z 1 z 2 z p t by the global mapping 10 z t f t z 0 z i t ℱ t z i 0 which constitutes the so called state space representation of the material transport fig 2a here set z 0 is defined such that the flow reorders the positions within the set z 0 ℱ t z i z j 5 5 this condition can always be fulfilled in at least the limit p by realising that a continuous fluid consists of an infinite set of fluid elements this has important ramifications for the analysis hereafter by rendering i the global mapping a linear matrix vector operation and ii f a permutation matrix f t 1 f t t and f t p i speetjens et al 2013 note that f is the adjoint to the mapping matrix describing the global eulerian evolution of concentration fields by distributive mixing speetjens et al 2013 kruijt et al 2001 this mapping matrix and thus f can be constructed from velocity data by the so called mapping method speetjens et al 2013 kruijt et al 2001 temperature evolution 7 admits a similar state space representation 11 t n 1 z 0 u t n z

representations as 11 enable construction of the spectral decomposition of matrix u and thus approximation of the pf operator u from temperature data by dynamic mode decomposition dmd kutz et al 2016 schmid 2010 chen et al 2012 a major advantage of state space representations is that they constitute matrix vector systems and thus admit linear algebra analyses 3 problem class i rapid heat extraction the analysis below concerns the first problem class of the present study section 1 i e rapid resource extraction which is investigated in terms of heat extraction by injection of a production fluid at low non dimensional inlet temperature t c ϑ 1 in a reservoir initially at uniform high non dimensional temperature t h 1 key to this process is the lagrangian motion of the thermal front bodvarsson 1972 woods and fitzgerald 1993 stopa and wojnarowski 2006 however none of the existing studies on this matter considers the effect of a systematically induced unsteady flow the following concerns a comparative performance analysis of the base flow representing conventional approaches versus rpm flows so as to determine the potential of unsteady reservoir flows for heat scalar recovery 3 1 heat extraction by the base flow the parameter ranges demarcated in section 2 2 revealed that pe 1 and thus in a first approximation heat transfer by diffusion can be neglected this reduces the lte model 6 to 13 lim pe t t π u t d t d t π dt d t 0 with d d t the material derivative relative to thermal velocity u π u and t π t the rescaled time frame relation 13 has the fundamental implications that isothermals in the advective limit pe i travel at thermal velocity u in current time frame t and ii behave as lagrangian fluid fronts travelling at fluid velocity u in time frame t hence 13 can here alternatively be described by the equivalent kinematic equations 14 d x d t u d x d t u with x t the momentary position of a material element that preserves temperature i e t x t t x 0 and is passively advected by the flows u u in the corresponding time frames t t fig 3a gives the temperature evolution t t for pe 106 and thus demonstrates the generic behaviour for pe 1 formation of a sharp thermal front between the remaining hot red and depleted cold blue regions and its propagation by u according to 14 here π 0 1 1 implies that the thermal front lags behind the associated fluid front which is located at shown thermal fronts at rescaled times t π t that travels from injector to extractor this is consistent with findings on egss bodvarsson 1972 woods and fitzgerald 1993 stopa and wojnarowski 2006 this delayed thermal transport and equivalence 14 are particularly relevant for rpm flows section 3 3 and section 4 fig 3b demonstrates the effect of diffusion by the temperature evolution for pe 102 and reveals that its impact consists primarily of smoothing the thermal front however using the intermediate isothermal t c t h 2 green for reference the thermal front as a whole propagates at approximately the same velocity as for pe 1 hence the delay relative to the fluid front is similar for any pe the net heat extraction by the base flow can be described via the integral energy balance corresponding with 6 reading 15 τ d t dt t c t out t t t 1 a a t x t da with t and t out the average reservoir and outlet temperatures respectively and a the domain area parameter τ a πlu defines the non dimensional thermal time constant with l the non dimensional arc length of the wells and u the mean non dimensional injection velocity and equals τ 9 83 for the base flow note that 15 holds for any pe such that diffusive heat flux across the inlet is negligible this condition is met for the present range pe o 10 2 the sharp thermal front in the advective limit fig 3a in conjunction with in a first approximation an assumed instantaneous extraction of said front at t τ a signifying so called thermal breakthrough implies t out t h for t τ a and t out t c for t τ a this yields 16 t a t t c t h t τ t h t τ a t c t τ a as analytical solution to 15 where t a τ a t c advances τ a τ as time of instantaneous thermal breakthrough the corresponding evolutions of t out and t a are in fig 4a and b respectively evolution 16 maintains maximum production temperature t out t h until full heat depletion i e t t c and thus involves the maximum extraction rate ζ a max ζ t h t c τ with ζ d t dt t out t c τ and 0 ζ ζ a hence instantaneous thermal breakthrough for purely advective heat transfer yields the theoretically fastest possible heat extraction and 16 thus sets the lower bound for any temperature evolution t t the actual thermal front in the advective limit pe is extracted in finite time interval t min t t max with t min t max t min π t max π 6 6 19 6 and t min t max 0 66 1 96 the minimum maximum residence times of fluid parcels trefry et al 2012 causing a smooth change over from t out t h to t out t c this results in a sub optimal production temperature t out t h and extraction rate ζ ζ a before full thermal breakthrough and in consequence an overall slower heat extraction compared to the theoretical limit fig 4a b illustrate this for pe 106 where the dashed lines indicate t min max these findings incorporate that ζ 0 ζ a for any configuration diffusion smoothens the thermal front fig 3b and thus progressively advances the onset of a sub optimal production temperature t out t h and extraction rate ζ to t t min with decreasing pe as shown in fig 4a via case pe 102 this further retards the heat extraction and thus implies temperature bounds 17 t a t t t t t with t a the theoretical limit 16 and t the evolution for the advective limit pe fig 4b illustrates inequality 17 using case pe 102 and exposes an only marginal impact of diffusion in the current pe range fig 4a furthermore reveals that the production temperature and thus the extraction rate may for finite pe temporarily exceed that of the advective limit at later stages however this is immaterial for inequality 17 3 2 heat extraction by rpm flows a key difference between rpm flows and the base flow is the formation of multiple thermal fronts in the former due to the systematic switching between active injection extraction wells this is demonstrated in figs 5 and 6 for pe 106 representing the advective limit and pe 102 representing a typical advective diffusive case respectively in the 3 step and 8 step flows however the thermal fronts individually behave essentially similar to those of the base flow sharp fronts travelling at velocity u following 14 for pe 1 akin to fig 3a smoothing of the front in case of significant diffusion akin to fig 3b the multiple thermal fronts result in the emergence and persistence of a central hot region the extent and location of which intimately relates to the lagrangian flow topology this is elaborated in section 3 3 the net heat extraction by the rpm flow remains governed by 15 yet with τ 9 78 and τ 9 54 for the 3 step flow and 8 step flows respectively due to the slight differences in domain shape 6 6 time constant τ being relatively lower for the rpm flow suggests that in the best case scenario of t out t h until instantaneous thermal breakthrough its heat extraction may outperform that of the base flow however the only marginal dependence of τ on the configuration and the in practice negligible size of the wells compared to the reservoir renders this effect negligible hence given the production temperature always satisfies t out t h the fastest heat extraction entirely analogous to the base flow section 3 1 also here corresponds with t out t h until full heat depletion and occurs for instantaneous thermal breakthrough in the advective limit thus 16 with τ a τ defines the lower temperature bound for rpm flows as well the actual thermal front of the base flow is in the advective limit extracted in a finite time interval t min t t max section 3 1 the step wise reorientation of the rpm flow causes a non trivial alignment of thermal fronts with the active extractor and in consequence a first front extraction that generically occurs at t t min signifying an earlier thermal breakthrough and inherently retarded heat extraction compared to the base flow this e g happens during step k 2 1 t 2 and step k 5 4 t 5 of the 8 step and 3 step flow respectively in fig 5 arrows indicate active extractors during these steps thus reservoir temperatures in the actual base flow bf and rpm flow generically are for pe 1 bounded as 18 t a t t bf t t rpm t as demonstrated in fig 7 by case pe 106 comparing the earlier stages of the evolutions in fig 5 versus fig 6 reveals that similar as for the base flow section 3 1 diffusion primarily smoothens the thermal front s yet without appreciable effect on propagation speed this implies that generically temperature bounds 18 are upheld for finite pe which is demonstrated in fig 7 by t rpm for pe 102 106 versus t bf and t a this has the important ramification that the rpm flow is generically outperformed by the base flow with respect to rapid heat extraction conversely well reorientation in reservoirs accommodating rpm like flow is for this purpose ineffective note that since dependence of t bf on pe is marginal in this pe range fig 4b case pe 102 of the base flow is not shown for brevity the impact of diffusion on t rpm on the other hand is significant and may in fact considerably accelerate heat extraction which is particularly apparent for the 8 well flow fig 7a this behaviour is essentially different from the base flow and must be attributed to the non trivial lagrangian flow topology of rpm flows section 3 3 3 3 heat extraction by rpm flows the role of lagrangian transport the essentially different behaviour regarding heat extraction of the rpm flows versus the base flow emanates from the corresponding lagrangian flow topologies the associated lcss namely define the pathways for fluid transport and thus determine the advective thermal transport the lcss for the base flow are the parallel streamlines connecting injector and extractor fig 1a and accomplish unhindered throughflow of the production fluid and in consequence the thermal front fig 3 the lagrangian flow topology in time periodic systems as the rpm flow can be visualised by so called stroboscopic maps of the lagragian motion of the fluid parcels aref et al 2017 the essentials of lcss and their role in transport as well as their visualisation are elaborated in appendix a however crucial in the present context is that advective thermal transport occurs at thermal velocity u π u section 3 1 and is equivalent to lagrangian fluid transport by velocity u in the rescaled time frame t π t according to equivalence 14 this has the fundamental implication that the lagrangian flow topology governing the advective thermal transport in the rpm flow for step duration t corresponds with that of a companion rpm flow for the rescaled duration t π t fig 8a and c give the stroboscopic maps versus the temperature field at t 24 for t π t as indicated and pe 106 for the 8 step and 3 step flows respectively this reveals a clear correlation in that the persistent hot core coincides with one particular lcs i e the central island in the lagrangian flow topology this lcs is special by entrapping fluid in the companion rpm flow such that it never leaves the reservoir and equivalently entrapping thermal energy in the advective limit of the actual rpm flow such that a hot core forms 7 7 such islands are inextricably linked to so called periodic points i e cyclically returning material points according to 43 and fig 19 which are key organising elements of the lagrangian flow topology of time periodic flows 6 relevant here are periodic points of the elliptic type which cause the local formation of islands following fig 19 left said lcs thus demarcates a region that is hydraulically disconnected and in the advective limit thermally disconnected from the wells in the companion and actual rpm flows respectively lcss in the remaining part of the lagrangian flow topology define hydraulically thermally connected regions here fluid is extracted re injected in the companion rpm flow and equivalently thermal energy extracted in the actual rpm flow thus cold annular regions enclosing the hot core gradually form as shown in fig 8 both connected and disconnected lcss play a central role in the second problem class viz in situ processing and are investigated extensively in section 4 here mainly the existence of disconnected lcs s is relevant in that they cause the inferior performance of the rpm versus the base flow regarding heat extraction the thermal energy in these entities is namely inaccessible in the advective limit and in consequence only fraction β 1 α of the total heat can be extracted with α the reservoir fraction occupied by said lcs s this implies for the generic case 0 α 1 an asymptotic reservoir temperature exceeding that of the base flow i e 19 lim t t rpm t t h β t h t c 1 α t c α t h t c lim t t bf t and in conjunction with a common initial extraction rate ζ 0 ζ a and monotonic decay of t temperature bounds 18 for at least the advective limit fig 8b and d give temperature evolution t t for the cases in fig 8a and c respectively demonstrating the monotonic decay towards an asymptotic state 19 proportional to the size of the central island in the corresponding stroboscopic map the impact of the disconnected lcs on both extent of the persistent hot core and retardation in heat extraction is most profound in the 8 step flow due to its substantially greater size compared to the 3 step flow the difference in lcs size and thus the adverse effect on heat extraction between former and latter flows in fact is representative for rpm flows comprising an even and odd number of steps respectively varghese et al 2017 diffusion enables heat transfer across lcs boundaries and thus eliminates the strict partitioning of the reservoir by dis connected lcss hence the persistent hot core of the advective limit gradually releases heat into the surrounding cold annular region through a thermal boundary layer and in consequence progressively diminishes with decreasing pe as demonstrated in fig 9 diffusion thus weakens the impact of the disconnected lcss in that they here retard rather than preclude heat extraction from the core diffusion in this capacity promotes heat release and gives rise to the accelerated heat extraction due to decreasing pe observed for the rpm flows in section 3 2 moreover the reservoir temperature is no longer bound from below by 19 and invariably decays to lim t t rpm t t c lim t t bf t 4 problem class ii in situ processing in contained zones the analysis below concerns the second problem class of the present study section 1 i e in situ processing in contained zones which is investigated in terms of the same thermal configuration as adopted for problem class i section 3 4 1 lcs based in situ processing strategy the emergence of persistent hot cores in the rpm and their intimate relation with certain lcss attributes detrimental for heat extraction section 3 has in fact great potential for in situ processing in contained zones 8 8 the base flow evidently disqualifies for this purpose due to its inability to create internal zones other than a separation by the fluid thermal front consider for illustration a circular body of polluted ground water injection of chemicals via the rpm through e g an enclosing 8 well configuration for t 1 yields assuming negligible diffusion an evolution of the contaminant distribution as in fig 5a where high red and low blue temperatures represent contaminated and treated water respectively this creates a well defined treatment zone that coincides with the hot core and associated disconnected lcs in fig 8a moreover systematic manipulation of the lcs by variation of t facilitates pro active regulation of this zone and or the reaction front defined by its boundary fig 8a in response to the process dynamics lcss namely form adjust almost instantly in the typically highly laminar reservoir flows and thus admit rapid and accurate control by the pumping scheme conversely such controlled reaction fronts enable shielding of designated regions this may e g find application for in situ mining of an ore body partially sitting below an inhabited area that must be shielded from penetration by leaching solutions the cold hot regions in the above example then correspond with mined shielded zones and the treatment zone thus is exterior to the interface dynamic treatment zones and reaction fronts by controlled lcss is an in situ processing capability beyond conventional static methods and lagrangian like methods relying on steady subsurface streamline patterns section 1 the lcs based concept furthermore extends to cases with significant diffusion the latter softens the link between treatment zone and lcss yet a strong correlation remains in the relevant pe range as illustrated in fig 9a for the above example the lagrangian flow topology and intrinsically the lcss namely is fundamentally embedded in the thermal transport hence lcss through their high controllability by the pumping scheme and intimate connection with the temperature field naturally emerge as internal actuators for the pro active and dynamic regulation of the system the above outlined the general principle of lcs based in situ processing on the basis of observations however key to an actual strategy is rigorously capturing the non trivial link between thermal transport and lcss in the generic case of diffusion this relies on two generic methods from dynamical systems theory decomposition of time evolutions into fundamental dynamic states and factorisation of the pf operator into components that each incorporate a physical mechanism of the dynamics former and latter are elaborated specifically for rpm flows in section 4 2 and section 4 3 respectively and employed to establish said link in section 4 4 insights thus gained lay the groundwork for lcs based in situ processing by rpm flows section 4 5 4 2 spectral decomposition of temperature evolutions in rpm flows spectral decomposition expresses temperature evolutions into fundamental dynamic states and thus admits systematic identification of the dominant eigenmodes section 2 4 1 these dominant modes are the first cornerstone of the sought after link between thermal transport and lcss the spectral decomposition of the temperature evolution of the rpm flow is essentially similar to the underlying flow a reorientation of that of the temperature evolution t b of the base flow the latter reads 20 t b x t u b t t 0 x k 0 γ k ϕ k x e λ k t which admits alternative expression as an evolution in spectral space i e 21 t b x t ϕ t x γ t γ t φ b t γ with φ b t diag e λ k t and γ the spectral counterparts to operator u b and initial condition t 0 x respectively rotation operator r r θ r θ θ acting upon a function f x via g x f r n x enables its description in terms of the original and reoriented eigenfunction bases ϕ x and ϕ r n x respectively via 22 f x ϕ t x α ϕ t r n x β β s n α with α and β the corresponding expansion coefficients and s the spectral rotation operator associated with r note that the reoriented eigenfunction basis ϕ r n x identifies with the original eigenfunction basis relative to the reoriented reference frame x n r n x with 1 n n co rotating with the active well pair combination of 21 with 22 enables expression of the step wise temperature evolution in the rpm flow in terms of the base flow decomposition via 23 t x n t ϕ t r n 1 x φ b γ n 1 ϕ t r n x γ n with corresponding spectral space evolution 24 γ n φ γ n 1 φ n γ φ s φ b where γ 0 γ and φ b φ b t thus step wise evolution 23 becomes a periodic evolution in spectral space according to 24 where φ sφ b incorporates the step wise flow and reorientation via φ b and s respectively relations 23 and 24 through property r pn i yield 25 t x pn t ϕ t x φ pn γ u pn t 0 x as corresponding period wise evolution described by pf operator 26 u n t 0 x k 0 α k ψ k x e n μ k t ψ t x α n α n ω n α where eigenfunction eigenvalue pairs ψ k μ k and coefficients α k follow from the eigendecomposition φ vωv 1 this gives 27 ψ t x ϕ t x v diag e μ k t ω α v 1 γ and ψ k x ϕ t x v k with v k the k th eigenvector of φ for the individual eigenfunctions thus 27 links the spectral decompositions 20 and 26 of the base and rpm flow respectively the spectral pf operators relating through 24 via polar decomposition φ sφ b renders this link non trivial hence the leading eigenmodes 8 of rpm flows do not directly follow from those of the base flow consider for illustration the spectral decomposition of the 8 step flow for t 4 and pe 104 which has an evolution akin to figs 5a 6a 8a the two leading modes ψ 1 and ψ 2 obtained by dmd section 2 4 are given in fig 10a and b respectively where the characteristic decay time τ k 1 μ k differs by an order of magnitude τ 2 τ 1 μ 1 μ 2 o 0 1 mode k 0 corresponds with the trivial case ψ 0 μ k t c 0 and is irrelevant here comparison of modes ψ 1 ψ 2 with the corresponding stroboscopic map in fig 10c reveals the distinct yet non trivial connection between thermal and lagrangian transport the slowest decaying mode ψ 1 fig 10a tightly concentrates around the upper island indicated by the red arrow in fig 10c and captures the impact of this lcs on the heat transfer said island is a disconnected lcs and thus retards heat extraction the non zero region of ψ 1 delineates the most persistent part of the corresponding hot core that results from this retardation and defines the zone with maximum thermal confinement decay time τ 1 determines the lifetime of this confinement mode ψ 1 progressively contracts around the upper island with diminishing diffusion not shown and in the advective limit its non zero region strictly coincides with this lcs while lifetime τ 1 becomes unbounded reflecting indefinite heat entrapment the second slowest eigenmode ψ 2 fig 10b correlates with the chain of 3 islands at the corners of the upper island indicated by the cyan arrows in fig 10c this island chain constitutes the set of connected lcss closest to the disconnected lcs underlying the hot core and thus plays a central role in the heat extraction from this region the associated mode ψ 2 namely invades the hot core blue non zero region in fig 10b and via 3 branches each emerging from one of the islands in the chain yellow non zero spikes in fig 10b connects to several of the wells 9 9 the branches in fact emerge from lcss inextricably linked to the islands shown in sec 4 5 2 thus mode ψ 2 governs the thermal interaction between hot core and wells and inherently the heat extraction from the reservoir the contribution of modes ψ k for k 3 not shown to the heat extraction grows increasingly short lived and thus rapidly weakens with growing mode order k due to the progressively increasing decay rate decreasing decay time τ k this also reduces the role of the corresponding lcss in the thermal transport i e basically all entities outside the non zero regions of the leading modes ψ 1 2 which in fig 10c involves the lower island and the bulk of the chaotic sea the above findings reveal that certain lcss are key to the thermal transport yet other lcss are only of secondary importance where the dominant eigenmodes here ψ 1 2 enable systematic isolation of the former to this end the link between lcss and dominant modes is further elaborated in section 4 3 and section 4 4 insights thus attained are in section 4 5 incorporated in an lcs based approach for two key elements of in situ processing thermal confinement section 4 5 1 and thermal interaction section 4 5 2 recasting the step wise evolution 23 through substitution r n x x as 28 t r n x n t ϕ t x γ n ϕ t x φ n γ describes this in the previous co rotating reference frame x n r n x with associated coordinate transformation x r n x connected with the reoriented eigenfunction basis evolution 28 identifies with the period wise evolution 25 implying that the period wise and step wise co rotating dynamics are identical this has the important consequence that the step wise evolutions in co rotating and fixed frames following 28 and 23 respectively are governed by pf operators following 29 t r n x n t u n t 0 x t x n t u n t 0 x with u according to 26 and u its fixed frame counterpart appendix b the corresponding spectral decompositions are explicitly linked via 26 and b 2 which enables the lcs based in situ processing framework elaborated below at both the period wise and step wise levels thus increasing its practical usefulness for enhanced subsurface transport moreover this allows determination of the spectral decomposition from dmd of the co rotating step wise evolutions which is far more efficient and typically less sensitive to noise than dmd based on period wise evolutions step wise dmd for an n step pumping scheme namely requires temperature data only for a time span 0 t t end n compared to 0 t t end for period wise dmd 4 3 thermal versus lagrangian transport in rpm flows the second cornerstone of lcs based in situ processing is the notion that lcss effectively are internal thermal actuators in that they by governing the advective heat transfer enable manipulation and control of the temperature field via the pumping scheme key to utilisation of the lcss for this purpose is determining how exactly they and the pumping scheme access the thermal problem this involves two steps i separation of the total heat transfer into purely thermal transport between and purely lagrangian transport of fluid parcels ii isolation of the lcss relevant to the thermal transport via said separation and the above spectral decomposition the first and second steps are elaborated below and in section 4 4 respectively the above separation of the total heat transfer follows from factorisation of the pf operators in the state space representation of the system section 2 4 2 introduce to this end the specific forms of 10 for the step wise mapping z n ℱ n z 0 in the co rotating frame and the base flow mapping z n ℱ b n z 0 reading 30 z n f b n z 0 z n f n z 0 respectively with z n ℛ n z n the position vector in the co rotating frame and ℛ the global counterpart to rotation operator r 10 10 mappings 30 by virtue of equivalence 14 correspond with both thermal velocity u π u for step duration t and fluid velocity u for step duration t t π the mappings relate consistent with generic reoriented flows via f ℛf b yielding f tot f n as period wise mapping speetjens et al 2006 moreover ℛ is likewise as f b and f section 2 4 2 a permutation operator with properties ℛ n ℐ and ℛ 1 ℛ t the associated global temperature evolutions are described by the state space representation 11 corresponding with the base flow evolution 20 and the step wise rpm evolution 28 relative to the co rotating reference frame this yields 31 t b z 0 u b t 0 z 0 t n ℛ tn z 0 t n z 0 u n t 0 z 0 with t b at t t the pf operators are given by 32 u b q b φ b q b 1 u n q φ n u b ℛ t n with φ b and φ as before q b q z 0 ϕ 0 z 0 ϕ 1 z 0 ϕ k z 0 and q q z 0 with z 0 ℛ n z 0 for any n the eigenfunction bases relative to fixed and co rotating frames respectively refer to appendix c for detailed derivations 11 11 relations z n ℛ n z n and z 0 ℛ n z 0 specifically concern expression of the evolution of the lagrangian positions of passive tracers released at z 0 following 30 and the global eulerian temperature evolution on the discrete fixed positions z 0 following 31 respectively in the co rotating reference frame hence former and latter relations must not identify for arbitrary n the state space representation enables factorisation of the pf operators 32 into two fundamental components according to 33 u b f b t g b g b f b u b u f t g g fu ℛ g b ℛ t where lagrangian factors f b t f t are the adjoints of mappings 30 describing lagrangian transport by distributive mixing section 2 4 2 and thermal factors g b g incorporate thermal boundary conditions bcs and diffusion thermal factors g b and g are the thermal transfer operators that link lagrangian and thermal transport factorisation 33 separates step wise thermal transport t n 1 u t n into the successive action of the thermal and lagrangian factor according to fig 11 thermal factor g via the temperature changes the heat content of the fluid parcels by the thermal bcs here resetting the temperature upon re injection and diffusive heat transfer between fluid parcels t n g t n this process is beyond the direct control of the pumping scheme lagrangian factor f t subsequently redistributes the during this action isothermal fluid parcels by the flow t n 1 f t t n the pumping scheme admits direct control of this process advancing the lcss in their capacity as governing entities for lagrangian transport as internal thermal actuators the factorisation reveals that the lcss and pumping scheme access the thermal problem via the intermediate temperature t n hence lcs based in situ processing effectively controls the evolution from t n to step wise final state t n 1 the prior evolution from t n to t n occurs via diffusion and bcs and is beyond direct control consider for illustration of the factor wise transport the heat transfer in the base flow this embarks on defining the extraction zone ℰ and re injection zone ℐ as the regions via which the extractor injector pair extracts re injects material during a given time span t fig 12a gives the factor wise temperature evolution corresponding with the temperature evolution in fig 3a for pe 106 representing the advective limit due to the alternating action of thermal factor g b t n g b t n and lagrangian factor f b t t n 1 f b t t n u b t n thermal factor g b changes the heat content of the during this step stationary fluid parcels by resetting their temperature in the extraction zone 12 12 extraction zone ℰ includes the boundary segment associated with the injection well bounded by the grey solid arc for t n to inlet temperature t c following 34 g b t b x t c for x ε g b t b x t b x for y ε causing the formation of the cold spots attached to the extraction well in the intermediate temperature fields t n and the thin thermal boundary layer at the injection well in t 0 lagrangian factor f b t subsequently redistributes the during this step isothermal fluid parcels by recycling the extracted reset material in the re injection zone demarcated by the grey dashed arc for t n repeated extraction re injection results in a step wise downward propagation of the thermal front indicated in fig 12a by grey dashed and black solid arcs for t 1 and t 2 respectively that separates cold re injected fluid blue from hot original fluid red fig 12b demonstrates the factor wise temperature evolution for the generic case of diffusion by the evolution for pe 102 fig 8b this reveals behaviour essentially similar to that of the advective limit fig 12a yet now including significant smoothing of temperature gradients due to appreciable diffusive heat exchange between fluid parcels the latter augments the thermal factor to 35 g b dg b with d incorporating the smoothing effect of diffusion and g b the thermal factor in the advective limit according to 34 accounting only for change in heat content of fluid parcels by temperature resetting upon re injection however the close resemblance in the factorisations for pe 106 and pe 102 suggests consistent with the findings in section 3 1 an only localised effect of diffusion in the considered pe ranges hence the action of thermal factor g b here primarily consists of the thermal resetting in the extraction zone demonstrated in fig 12 for t 0 and t 1 the rpm admits an equivalent factorisation of operator u according to 33 and fig 13 demonstrates the factor wise evolution for typical temperature evolutions in the 3 step flow at moderate diffusion pe 104 the factorisation is relative to the co rotating reference frame demonstrated in fig b 21b thus initial intermediate states t n t n and final state t n 1 of a given step n are expressed relative to frames x n and x n 1 r 1 x n respectively this reveals essential similarities with the base flow fig 12 i temperature resetting of the fluid parcels to t c in the extraction zone solid grey curve by thermal factor g via t n g t n ii redistribution of the fluid parcels by their mapping onto the re injection zone dashed grey curve by lagrangian factor f t via t n 1 g t n redistribution here includes step wise reorientation and thus yields shown position of extraction versus re injection zone moreover the impact of diffusion is again restricted to localised smoothing of temperature gradients meaning that also in the rpm flow the action of thermal factor g primarily consists of thermal resetting in the extraction zone this similarity is a direct consequence of the fact that thermal factor g through relation 33 identifies with thermal factor g b of the base flow following 34 and 35 in the initial reference frame x n hence coincidence of the extraction zones for intermediate temperature t n in figs 12 and 13 however an essential difference is that the step wise progression by virtue of the reorientation gradually eats away the interior hot region until a central hot core as shown in fig 9b remains this behaviour is inextricably linked to the lcss and their role in the thermal transport which is elaborated below 4 4 towards an lcs based in situ processing strategy for rpm flows the spectral decomposition of the temperature evolution section 4 2 and factorisation of the step wise heat transfer section 4 3 facilitate determination of the sought after link between thermal transport and lcss required for the lcs based processing strategy section 4 1 the general connection between thermal transport and individual dis connected lcss is established by the factorisation in sections 4 4 1 and 4 4 2 the spectral decomposition is subsequently employed to isolate the subset of dis connected lcss that are relevant for in situ processing in section 4 4 3 4 4 1 connected versus disconnected lcss the factorisation following section 4 3 enables rigorous definition of the two fundamental kinds of entities in the lagrangian flow topology identified in section 3 3 i e connected versus disconnected lcss based on their interaction with the associated extraction re injection zones fig 14 gives the stroboscopic map for the 3 step and 8 step companion rpm flows as a function of t including the extraction blue and re injection cyan zones corresponding with the thermal and lagrangian factors the relative orientation of extraction and re injection zones emanates from the beforementioned reorientation between initial and final states of a given step n lcss partially coinciding with these zones exchange fluid with the wells in the companion flow and constitute hydraulically connected lcss these entities owing to mass conservation invariably connect with both extraction and re injection zones and thus accommodate a circulation akin to that of the base flow lcss outside said zones entrap fluid indefinitely in the companion flow and thus define hydraulically disconnected lcss the hydraulically dis connected lcss of the companion rpm flow define the thermally dis connected lcs in the advective limit of the actual rpm flow section 3 3 here only the central island is a disconnected lcs all others entities are connected lcss 13 13 connected lcss must not necessarily fully coincide with the extraction re injection zones for island chains as those enclosing the central island it e g suffices if at least one island is within said zones the cyclic progression through the chain then always causes material elements within any island to reach the zones and connect with the wells hence the gradual emergence of the hot core in fig 13 exactly on the corresponding island for t 0 1 in fig 14a and the consistent coincidence of said core and island in all the cases shown in fig 8 diffusion softens the link between lcss and temperature field and admits thermal crosstalk between dis connected lcss via the smooth transitions from thermally reset regions blue to unaffected regions red in figs 12 and 13 this underlies the gradual spreading of the hot core across the boundary of the central island in fig 9 4 4 2 thermal transport versus individual dis connected lcss the fundamental connection between thermal and lagrangian transport can be further differentiated to individual dis connected lcss using the property that lcss partition the lagrangian flow topology into disjoint subregions between which no fluid exchange occurs this implies an embedded block diagonal structure of step wise mapping f in 30 which can be exposed by a reordering of the global position vector via z p z with p the permutation operator as per speetjens et al 2013 yielding 36 z n f n z 0 f pfp t bdiag f 1 f j where blocks f j describe the local lagrangian transport of fluid parcels within lcs j e g an island 14 14 relation 36 hinges on the fact that analogous with the spectral decomposition the stroboscopic map s of the period wise and step wise co rotating evolutions identify varghese et al 2017 speetjens et al 2006 restriction of fluid motion to individual lcss reflected in the embedded structure 36 has important implications for the associated thermal transport consider to this end the step wise rpm evolution according to 31 relative to the reordered position vector i e 37 t n ℛ tn z 0 t n z 0 u n t 0 z 0 u pup t f t g using commutation property pℛ n ℛ n p with f following 36 and g pgp t heat exchange between lcss is absent in the advective limit and the thermal factor in consequence adopts the block diagonal structure of the lagrangian factor f i e g bdiag g 1 g j with g j the factor associated with lcs j the identical block diagonal structure of the factors in said limit is imparted on u yielding 38 u f t g bdiag u 1 u j u j f j t g j meaning that the heat transfer is subject to the same lcs wise restriction as the fluid motion where g j depends on the nature of lcs j this signifies a fundamental embedding of the lcss in the advective heat transfer disconnected lcss are thermally isolated implying g j i and thus u j f j t rendering thermal transport equivalent to distributive mixing connected lcss on the other hand accommodate a circulation similar to the base flow implying a thermal factor g j following 34 hence fluid parcels in disconnected and connected lcss maintain the initial temperature and are over several cycles reset to the inlet temperature respectively resulting in a temperature field that is strictly separated by dis connected lcss diffusion results in the beforementioned thermal crosstalk between dis connected lcss and thus lifts the lcs wise restriction of the heat transfer this manifests itself in the breakdown of the above block diagonal structure of the global thermal factor g and inherently u according to 38 the lagrangian factor f t on the other hand retains its block diagonal structure and thereby reflects the fact that the lagrangian flow topology and its partitioning by lcss remains fundamentally embedded in the thermal transport in case of diffusion thus u remains diagonally dominant signifying a strong correlation between lcss and heat transfer in the relevant pe range this pivotal role of lcss in the structure of u and inherently the system dynamics substantiates their designation as internal thermal actuators following fig 11 and naturally advances the proposed lcs based approach as a suitable way for pro active in situ processing 4 4 3 dominant lcss in the thermal transport the example in fig 10 demonstrated that only lcs associated with the dominant modes in spectral decomposition 26 of the temperature evolution are relevant to the thermal transport the link between individual lcss and said evolution established above enables systematic isolation of these lcss denoted dominant lcss hereafter express 26 to this end in terms of state space representation 37 i e 39 t n ℛ tn z 0 u n t 0 z 0 k 0 α k ψ k z 0 e n μ k t where the block diagonal structure 38 of u in the advective limit implies reminiscent of distributive mixing speetjens et al 2013 a strict partitioning of the total set of eigenmodes into subsets that each belong to a given lcs 15 15 this connection between spectral decomposition of the pf operator and its adjoint the koopman operator and composition of the lagrangian flow topology is a fundamental property of advective transport and has e g found application for the isolation and visualisation of lcss froyland et al 2007 budišić and mezić 2012 hence thermal eigenmodes and lcss are spatially inextricably linked moreover the corresponding generically complex eigenvalues μ k σ k i ω k with ℜ μ k 0 section 2 4 1 depend on the kind of lcs heat depletion versus thermal isolation for dis connected lcss namely implies 40 ℜ μ k connected lcss 0 ℜ μ k disconnected lcss 0 meaning that decaying ℜ μ k 0 and invariant ℜ μ k 0 modes are in the advective limit strictly tied to connected and disconnected lcss respectively consistent with the earlier finding that fluid parcels maintain the initial temperature in the former lcss and are reset to the inlet temperature in the latter lcss hence the disconnected lcss constitute the dominant lcss associated with thermal confinement and the connected lcss with the slowest temperature resetting define the dominant lcs governing the thermal interaction between reservoir and wells diffusion by breaking the block diagonal structure 38 softens the link between thermal eigenmodes and lcss thus the former gradually extend beyond the boundaries of the latter thereby establishing couplings between dis connected lcss however eigenmodes and lcss remain spatially closely correlated by virtue of the persisting diagonally dominant structure of u imparted by the lagrangian flow topology section 4 4 2 a given eigenmode therefore stays the strongest within the lcs associated with its advective limit furthermore diffusion by accomplishing global heat depletion causes all eigenvalues to meet ℜ μ k 0 yet the above ordering by dis connected lcss generically persists implying a smooth transition of 40 into 41 max ℜ μ k connected lcss max ℜ μ k disconnected lcss 0 upon departure from the advective limit thus the above roles of the disconnected and connected lcss as dominant lcss for thermal confinement and thermal interaction respectively are generically preserved upon introducing diffusion the example in fig 10 demonstrates these characteristics the first leading eigenmode ψ 1 is linked with the central island i e the sole disconnected lcs and given moderate diffusion slightly extends beyond its boundary while marginally departing from the advective limit μ 1 0 for the associated eigenvalue the second leading eigenmode ψ 2 closely correlates with one of the island chains surrounding the central island and given ψ 2 connects with the wells designates this a connected lcs coincidence of non zero regions of ψ 1 and ψ 2 with both lcss reflects coupling due to diffusion however each mode clearly remains the strongest within its associated lcs furthermore relation μ 2 μ 1 signifies consistency with inequality 41 4 5 lcs based in situ processing by rpm flows the common objective for generic in situ processing problems is creation of a well defined processing zone and associated boundary section 4 1 such zones correspond in the present thermal context with subsurface regions that reminiscent of the persistent hot cores mentioned before maximally confine heat and maintain the initial temperature thermal confinement essential to in situ processing furthermore is scalar exchange and interaction between processing zone and wells here this consists of heat transfer between former and latter thermal interaction the link between thermal and lagrangian transport established in section 4 4 lays the groundwork for lcs based in situ processing by rpm flows by enabling systematic demarcation and characterisation of thermal confinement zones and thermal interaction channels and association with specific dis connected lcss for the generic case of diffusion this is elaborated for thermal confinement and interaction in sections 4 5 1 and 4 5 2 respectively 4 5 1 thermal confinement the beforementioned central island is the sole disconnected lcs in the considered rpm flows and thus the dominant lcs associated with thermal confinement the leading eigenmode ψ 1 is by virtue of inequality 41 inextricably linked to this lcs and its non zero regions thus demarcate the associated thermal confinement zone in the generic case of diffusion fig 10 clearly demonstrates this essential connection and close correlation between leading eigenmode ψ 1 and said island the thermal confinement mode ψ 1 versus the lagrangian flow topology right column is given in fig 15 for the 8 step flow as a function of the pumping scheme step duration t and pe this reveals the persistence of a thermal confinement zone throughout parameter space that continues to be shaped by the central island irrespective of considerable changes in its extent and location with varying conditions diffusion renders the correlation between thermal mode ψ 1 and island progressively non trivial yet a clear link and ability for confinement exists for pe o 10 3 this parameter range encompasses most practical cases the constancy of this link for a wide pe range reveals that lcss indeed act as internal thermal actuators following fig 11 this supports the working principle of the lcs based approach by demonstrating that the association of a thermal confinement mode with dominant disconnected lcs s facilitates even for significant diffusion well controlled creation and regulation of an in situ processing zone fig 16 shows the thermal confinement mode for given pumping scheme and pe versus the lagrangian flow topology right column in the 3 step flow this exposes an equally strong and robust correlation between thermal confinement mode and central island and thus substantiates the above findings and in turn the generality and potential of the lcs based approach note that the 3 step flow belongs to the generic class of configurations with an odd number of steps which accommodate far smaller disconnected islands compared to even step configurations as e g the above 8 step flow 16 16 the wells in the odd step configurations act either as source or as sink this promotes short circuiting of the fluid transport between adjacent source sink pairs and leaves comparable little room for the formation of a central island entrapping fluid wells in even step configurations on the other hand continuously alternative between source and sink functions and thus tend to slosh fluid back and forth through the same well this promotes fluid entrapment and in consequence formation of a large central island refer to varghese et al 2017 for details this generically tends to render odd step flows less suitable for establishment of thermal confinement zones however diffusion may expand the latter to similar sizes as in even step flows compare e g case t pe 4 10 4 for the 8 step versus 3 step flow in figs 15e and 16c respectively hence odd step flows may be equally effective for thermal confinement as their even step counterparts thus increasing the processing capabilities in case of significant diffusion the thermal confinement zones accomplish maximal yet not indefinite confinement of heat in the generic case of diffusion due to the heat exchange between dis connected lcss for finite pe section 4 4 2 hence a given temperature distribution has a characteristic decay time or equivalently lifetime τ 1 1 μ 1 with μ 1 the eigenvalues corresponding with ψ 1 in figs 15 and 16 for the application examples in section 4 1 lifetime τ 1 determines the required treatment time for contaminated groundwater or dissolved minerals within the confinement zone or the safe operating window for in situ recovery exterior to said zone fig 17 shows the relative lifetime τ 1 τ 1 t 1 μ 1 t versus pe and t revealing consistent with weaker diffusion retarding heat release an increase with pe approximately following the power law τ 1 pe n indicated by lines the rate of increase is comparable i e n 0 55 0 6 for all t in the 8 step flow signifying an only marginal dependence on the pumping scheme fig 17a the 3 step flow on the other hand is far more sensitive to pe for higher t fig 17b compare to this end n 0 25 for t 2 versus n 0 44 for t 4 moreover the relative lifetime for given pe depends significantly on both pumping scheme and well configuration as demonstrated in fig 17c for τ 1 at pe 103 dashed vertical line in fig 17a and b and again follows a power law i e τ 1 t n curves with n 0 76 and n 1 51 for the 3 step and 8 step flows respectively hence increasing the step duration t considerably reduces the relative lifetime τ 1 this must be attributed to the increasingly chaotic environment which promotes thermal transport surrounding the central island with increasing t π t figs 15 and 16 these findings reveal a strong and non trivial dependence of the confinement abilities on the flow conditions the 8 step flow yields substantially higher lifetimes signifying stronger confinement because of the far larger central island compared to the 3 step flow yet has a much greater sensitivity to t enabling greater variation and flexibility of operating conditions due to the considerable decrease in island size with longer step durations hence the optimal well configuration and pumping scheme depend on the particular purpose and goals the strong link between thermal confinement mode and corresponding lcs in any case admit robust and accurate regulation of this process 4 5 2 thermal interaction thermal interaction relies essentially on thermal transport between wells and hot core and thus connected lcss come into play the spectral decomposition enables systematic identification of the underlying transport paths and relevant lcss thermal interaction by virtue of inequality 41 namely is dominated by the slowest decaying mode that appreciably extends from the central island into the connected lcs s the link between thermal eigenmodes and lcss established in section 4 4 3 implies an accompanying dominant lcs that via the lcs based actuation following fig 11 facilitates regulation of the thermal interaction reconsider to this end the example shown in fig 10 the second leading eigenmode ψ 2 fig 10b clearly connects the hot core with the wells via the 3 emerging branches and thus defines this thermal interaction mode the investigation below demonstrates that the latter generically coincides with mode ψ 2 and isolates the associated connected lcss fig 18a and b give typical thermal interaction modes ψ 2 for the 3 step flow in the thermal confinement range pe o 10 3 for t 1 versus the lagrangian fluid exchange between wells and reservoir in the companion rpm flow at t 0 1 fig 18c the latter is visualised by the stroboscopic map of a single tracer released just outside the disconnected island centred on the green marker indicating the corresponding elliptic periodic point following appendix a and exposes a continuous circulation past this entity via local gyres indicated by blue arrows in fig 18c driven by adjacent injector extractor pairs this sets up three incoming jets of cold fluid each comprising two counter rotating gyres emanating from injectors 1 3 5 and impinging upon the central island these cold jets thus extract heat from the hot core and constitute the connected lcss that dictate the thermal interaction the non zero regions of the corresponding thermal interaction modes that extend from the hot core coincide with the outgoing hot jets and thus delineate the transport paths for advective heat transfer from hot core to extractors 2 4 6 comparing fig 18a and b reveals that the impact of diffusion is restricted to widening of the connecting paths between core and extractors the formation of gyres by adjacent injector extractor pairs is generic for odd step flows at lower step durations varghese et al 2017 hence thermal interaction modes for n step configurations describe essentially similar patterns as in fig 18a and b yet consisting of n branches extending away from the hot core to the extractors the thermal interaction mode ψ 2 changes dramatically upon increasing the step duration t as demonstrated in fig 18d for pe 103 and t 4 due to a fundamental change in the lagrangian fluid motion the stroboscopic map in fig 18e namely reveals the emergence of a chain of 3 periodic points cyan stars i e cyclically returning material points according to a 2 and fig 20b around the disconnected island centred on the green marker these periodic points are of the hyperbolic type complementary to said elliptic point and determine the lagrangian fluid transport by their associated lcss i e the stable and unstable manifolds following fig 20c right 17 17 such manifolds are the actual lcss from which the 3 branches in fig 10 b emerge they are nonetheless inextricably linked with the 3 island chain at the corners of the upper island in that island chains invariably coexist with chains of hyperbolic points and associated manifolds in the lagrangian flow topologies of 2d incompressible flows aref et al 2017 the un stable manifolds and the impact upon the transport are visualised by the stroboscopic map of a minute circle of tracers black markers released on the upper hyperbolic point the earlier stages of said stroboscopic map outline segments of the unstable manifold red markers the reflections about the symmetry axis dashed line by virtue of time reversal symmetry outline segments of the corresponding stable manifold blue markers varghese et al 2017 aref et al 2017 the un stable manifolds delineate the principal transport directions indicated by blue arrows and set up the fluid exchange between wells and central region as well as the local circulation around the disconnected island associated with the latter 18 18 neighbouring hyperbolic points are always connected by a stable and unstable manifold segment this reflects so called heteroclinic manifold interaction aref et al 2017 this construct of hyperbolic points and manifolds defines the dominant connected lcss associated with the thermal interaction mode ψ 2 outflux of hot fluid occurs via the unstable red manifold segments extending from hot core to extractors 4 6 influx of cold fluid occurs via the stable blue manifold segments between hot core and injectors 1 3 19 19 the unstable red and stable blue manifold segments attached to injector 3 and extractor 4 respectively interact heteroclinically with manifolds of opposite stability extending from the core thus said unstable manifold segments dictate the advective heat transfer from core to extractors and shape the thermal interaction mode ψ 2 in a similar way as the outgoing hot jets in fig 18c shape the modes in fig 18a and b the manifold construct in fig 18e reveals that the thermal interaction between central region and wells happens primarily through injectors 1 3 and extractors 4 6 moreover the complex eigenvalue μ 2 σ 2 i ω 2 with σ 2 0 42 and ω 2 2 20 signifies a thermal interaction dominated by an oscillatory advective heat flux asynchronous with the step wise switching of the pumping scheme the period time of the former namely equals t 2 π ω 2 2 86 t this reflects the non trivial interaction between advective and diffusive heat transfer the thermal interaction modes versus lagrangian flow topologies for the 8 step flow under the same thermal conditions are shown in fig 19 this exposes a fundamental difference with the above in that irrespective of the step duration the dominant connected lcss here always comprise of manifold constructs akin to that in fig 18e fig 19c and e give these constructs for t 0 1 and t 0 4 respectively and reveal an essentially similar composition a chain of hyperbolic points cyan stars surrounding the disconnected island centred on the green marker that via the associated stable blue and unstable red manifolds again sets up fluid exchange between central region and wells and a local circulation the invariable emergence of such constructs stems from the fact that the lagrangian flow topology for even step flows instead of gyres as in fig 18c tends towards a global island for diminishing t varghese et al 2017 hence the confinement zone and its immediate environment is topologically the same for any t and the advective heat transfer is therefore always dictated by the unstable red manifold segments for lower step durations this gives rise to a large scale advective circulation zone around the central region and the emergence of hot plumes extending towards the wells as demonstrated in fig 19a and b where diffusion merely has a smoothing effect higher step durations cause a progressive diminution of the central island in favour of an expanding manifold construct as shown in fig 19e for t 4 the resulting outflux and influx of hot cold fluid and thus the advective heat transfer increasingly concentrate around the un stable manifold segments extending from hot core to wells 6 8 and 1 3 respectively as demonstrated in fig 19d for t 4 and pe 103 the manifold construct thus reveals that wells 1 3 and 6 8 though wells in even step flows alternately act as injector and extractor predominantly behave as injectors and extractors respectively the complex eigenvalue μ 2 σ 2 i ω 2 with σ 2 0 41 and ω 2 2 37 signifies as observed before for the 3 step flow oscillatory thermal transport that given period time t 2 π ω 2 2 65 t is asynchronous with the step wise switching of the pumping scheme the thermal interaction mode of the 8 step flow in fig 19d including the corresponding eigenvalue μ 2 is strikingly similar to its counterpart in the 3 step flow following fig 18d and together with increasingly comparable thermal confinement zones section 4 5 1 implies a growing similarity in the confinement characteristics for higher step durations this must be attributed to the increasingly similar lagrangian flow topologies evident from comparing fig 18e and fig 19e and in particular the manifold construct around the central island that governs the advective heat transfer from the confinement zone this corroborates the crucial role of a small and well identifiable set of dominant lcss in the thermal transport and thus lends further support to the proposed lcs based approach as per fig 11 for robust and accurate regulation of in situ processing 5 conclusions the study investigates scalar transport in enhanced subsurface flows driven by injection and extraction wells for two generic transport problems of great practical relevance i rapid scalar extraction and ii contained in situ processing these transport problems are without loss of generality examined in terms of the thermal transport in a two dimensional 2d circular subsurface reservoir with a darcy type flow driven by injection and extraction wells positioned on its perimeter considered are steady flow due to a static injector extractor pair base flow and time periodic flows due to reoriented well pairs rpm flow lagrangian fluid transport is key to the problems of interest due to their generically advection dominated nature and thus the notion of lagrangian coherent structures lcss is adopted for in depth analyses and development of new concepts for subsurface flow engineering heat extraction is governed by the lagrangian motion of the thermal front the latter reaching one of the extraction well s signifying thermal breakthrough reduces the production temperature and by virtue of energy conservation the heat extraction compared to the pre breakthrough stage thus the base flow in case of instantaneous thermal breakthrough and purely advective heat transfer yields the theoretically fastest heat extraction any other configuration is invariably slower moreover the base flow generically outperforms rpm flows regarding heat extraction meaning that well reorientation in rpm like reservoir flow is for this purpose ineffective diffusion retards heat extraction in the base flow yet generically accelerates this process in rpm flows the essentially different behaviour of the rpm flows stems from the existence of island like lcss that disconnect regions from the extraction wells by entrapping fluid in the reservoir interior such disconnected lcss entrap heat indefinitely in the advective limit diffusion promotes heat release from these entities yet they nonetheless retard heat extraction compared to the base flow this explains both the underperformance of rpm flows relative to the base flow and the reduction in performance gap between former and latter with stronger diffusion heat entrapment by disconnected lcss in rpm flows attributes detrimental for heat extraction has in fact great potential for in situ processing in contained zones lcs via a mathematical technique known as operator factorisation are namely shown to be fundamentally embedded in the thermal transport and given they admit rapid and accurate control by the pumping scheme thus naturally emerge as internal actuators for the creation of dynamic processing zones and reaction fronts two key elements of in situ processing viz the formation of a thermal confinement zone and its interaction with the wells by advective heat transfer are rigorously linked to specific lcss by so called spectral decomposition of the temperature evolution into fundamental dynamic states eigenmodes this enables akin to determination of dominant frequencies in an audio signal by fourier analysis isolation of two eigenmodes that govern confinement and interaction for the generic case of diffusion first a thermal confinement mode demarcating the effective confinement zone associated with the beforementioned disconnected lcs second an accompanying thermal interaction mode demarcating the channels of advective heat transfer between said zone and the wells the connected lcss corresponding with these channels are material curves manifolds emanating from a chain of cyclically returning material points hyperbolic points surrounding the confinement zone these manifolds delineate the principal transport directions away from this zone the approach adopted for scalar transport in rpm flows generalises to more complex subsurface systems the formation of lcss occurs for any fluid transport subject to continuity and mass conservation irrespective of e g fluid rheology or domain geometry moreover only limited sets of lcss are permissible for a given flow class the lagrangian flow topology of 2d incompressible reservoir flows e g always consists of the same two elementary building blocks as encountered in the rpm flows islands and chaotic seas case specific is only their particular arrangement anisotropy e g has a major impact on this arrangement in rpm flows varghese et al 2017 the eigenmode structure of the corresponding temperature evolutions and its intimate connection with the lcss is equally generic heterogeneity and the typically non fickian scalar transport ensuing from this berkowitz et al n d neuman and tartakovsky 2009 dentz et al 2011 lester et al 2016 dentz et al 2016 though significantly impacting the dynamics does not fundamentally alter this generic behaviour furthermore lagrangian and scalar transport in essentially 3d systems though dynamically far richer exhibits similar generic properties and structures aref et al 2017 hence investigation and characterisation of subsurface transport by lcss and associated eigenmodes as well as the proposed lcs based in situ processing in principle is applicable to any reservoir flow key premise for in situ processing is the existence of disconnected lcss parametric studies on the lagrangian flow topology using stroboscopic maps offer a systematic way to identify such conditions in generic reservoir flows the above framework admits relatively straightforward integration into computational tools for subsurface transport analyses and development of reservoir management scheme due to the data based nature of the employed methods the thermal confinement interaction modes that characterise confinement can be isolated from temperature data by the data analysis technique dynamic mode decomposition the corresponding lcss can be visualised by stroboscopic maps constructed from velocity data both temperature and velocity data can be obtained via conventional cfd making the methodology as applied to rpm flows in this study

transport analyses refer to haller 2015 aref et al 2017 for background and details in time periodic flows a common way to visualise the lagrangian motion of passive tracers described by 9 is via so called stroboscopic maps 20 20 alternatively denoted poincaré sections in literature aref et al 2017 such maps consist of the sequence of positions at the end of each period i e a 1 s z 0 z 0 z 1 z k

after p periods i e a 2 z k ℱ t period k z 0 as illustrated in fig 20b for p 1 and p 3 two kinds of periodic points exist in 2d flows elliptic and hyperbolic points elliptic points are the center of islands formed by closed concentric orbits as shown in fig 20c left these islands thus entrap fluid and are the associated lcss that travel along with the elliptic points during their excursions following fig 20b hyperbolic points are the origin of two special material curves that define the principal stretching red and contraction blue directions in the flow region they inhabit following fig 20c right former and latter curves define the so called unstable manifold and stable manifold of the hyperbolic point these lcss in time periodic flows typically cause so called chaotic advection that is the exponential deformation of material fluid regions and in consequence rapid dispersion of passive tracers by repeated stretching and folding of fluid parcels thus hyperbolic points through their manifolds generically cause the formation of chaotic seas fig 20 lagrangian coherent structures lcss in the stroboscopic maps of time periodic flows islands of elliptic points unstable red and stable

1581,scope is scalar transport in enhanced subsurface flows driven by injection and extraction wells two transport problems of great practical relevance viz i rapid scalar extraction and ii contained in situ processing are investigated in terms of the thermal transport in a two dimensional circular subsurface reservoir with a well driven darcy type flow lagrangian fluid transport is key to these problems and thus the notion of lagrangian coherent structures lcss is adopted for analysis and engineering purposes analysis by this approach of heat scalar extraction reveals that a basic pumping scheme involving a static injector extractor pair invariably outperforms more elaborate schemes using time periodic actuation of multiple well pairs due to the formation of special lcss that retard heat release such lcss are on the other hand well suited for contained in situ processing lcss namely are fundamentally embedded in the thermal scalar transport and given they admit rapid and accurate control by the pumping scheme thus naturally emerge as internal actuators for the creation of dynamic processing zones and reaction fronts this principle has been developed into an lcs based in situ processing strategy to this end the non trivial link between thermal and lagrangian transport is rigorously established via methods from dynamical systems theory so as to enable systematic demarcation and characterisation of confinement zones and their interaction with the wells for the generic case of diffusion the framework thus developed is demonstrated by way of examples keywords subsurface scalar transport in situ recovery remediation lagrangian coherent structures dynamic mode decomposition reservoir management 1 introduction scope of the study is scalar transport in enhanced subsurface flows driven by injection and extraction wells this principle finds application in for example enhanced geothermal systems egss chen and wyborn 2009 pruess 2006 brown et al 2012 chen and jiang 2015 in situ recovery of minerals or oil dreisinger 2006 seredkin et al 2016 guo et al 2016 and groundwater remediation cunningham and reinhard 2002 hoelen et al 2006 goltz and christ 2012 and essentially always concerns one of two problems i rapid extraction of a subsurface scalar e g heat or contaminants or ii in situ processing and remediation e g of groundwater the latter problem can be differentiated into two subclasses first in situ processing by the continuous throughflow of a circulating production fluid through the region of interest bounded by fixed geological or man made barriers subsurface recovery of e g minerals or metals adopts this approach so called leaching solutions are injected via the production fluid and after take up of the dissolved substance of interest treated in an extraction plant dreisinger 2006 seredkin et al 2016 second in situ processing by the creation of a contained subsurface processing zone i e without continuous throughflow of a production fluid across its boundary groundwater remediation by so called permeable reactive treatment zones relies on this principle permeable reactive barriers demarcate such zones and simultaneously act as i reaction front for water treatment and ii partial transport barrier by admitting passage only to clean groundwater and holding the contaminants goltz and christ 2012 morrison et al 2003 stroo 2010 gillham and vogan 2012 lagrangian fluid transport is key to the above problems due to their generically advection dominated nature péclet numbers typically are in the range pe 103 yet dedicated lagrangian studies to date primarily concern in situ processing by circulating production fluids these studies aim at efficient distribution and subsurface mixing of e g leaching solutions or water disinfection agents and successfully adopt the lagrangian concept of chaotic advection to accomplish this goal bagtzoglou and oates 2007 lester et al 2009 metcalfe et al 2010a metcalfe et al 2010b trefry et al 2012 mays and neupauer 2012 piscopo et al 2013 neupauer et al 2014 varghese et al 2017 rodriguez escales et al 2017 such insights are beyond investigations relying solely on eulerian flow and scalar fields dedicated lagrangian approaches towards subsurface scalar extraction and contained in situ processing on the other hand are practically non existent lagrangian like studies include investigation of resource extraction via the propagating front between depleted and resource rich region e g the thermal front in egss and creation of contained in situ processing zones and or transport barriers by subsurface streamline patterns of well driven recirculation flows goltz and christ 2012 however none of the known studies on transport involving said extraction and or containment save a first onset to in situ processing in trefry et al 2012 explicitly incorporates lagrangian transport physics despite the proven worth for subsurface mixing in bagtzoglou and oates 2007 lester et al 2009 metcalfe et al 2010a metcalfe et al 2010b trefry et al 2012 mays and neupauer 2012 piscopo et al 2013 neupauer et al 2014 varghese et al 2017 rodriguez escales et al 2017 to deepen insights and or develop new concepts for subsurface flow engineering this motivates the present study the current study adopts the geometric perspective towards lagrangian fluid transport by describing and investigating this through the geometry topology of the lagrangian fluid trajectories i e the lagrangian flow topology which is composed of elementary structures denoted lagrangian coherent structures lcss haller 2015 aref et al 2017 lcss offer fundamental insights in the transport phenomena and have found successful application in a wide range of transport studies aref et al 2017 metcalfe et al 2012 including the beforementioned in situ processing based on chaotic advection 1 1 a further development of the concept of chaotic advection specifically in the context of subsurface and porous media flows exists in the continuous time random walk of lagrangian fluid parcels this in essence concerns chaotic advection induced by the spatial micro structure of the porous medium and may in conjunction with diffusion yield highly non trivial scalar transport berkowitz et al n d neuman and tartakovsky 2009 dentz et al 2011 lester et al 2016 dentz et al 2016 principal goal of the following study expanding on a first onset in trefry et al 2012 is extension of this lagrangian approach to the other two subsurface transport problems identified above viz i rapid scalar extraction and ii contained in situ processing for in depth transport analyses and exploration of lcs based subsurface flow engineering lcss namely define natural building blocks for the systematic creation of dynamic processing zones transport barriers and reaction fronts and thus offer promising alternatives to conventional methods the latter typically are laborious and inflexible by creating static zone boundaries via a variety of techniques including injection of reactants establishment of ice walls or construction of infiltration trenches morrison et al 2003 stroo 2010 gillham and vogan 2012 ryan et al 2010 zendehboudi and bahadori 2017 lcss on the other hand emerge naturally in subsurface flow systems and admit rapid and accurate control by the pumping scheme 2 2 consider as proof of concept e g the active stabilisation of vortex patterns lauret et al 2013 the two transport problems of interest are without loss of generality examined in terms of the thermal transport in a two dimensional 2d circular subsurface reservoir with a darcy type flow driven by injection extraction wells on its perimeter pumping schemes are considered that yield both steady and time periodic flows so as to create transport conditions representative of a wide range of practical systems the problem definition and employed methods for its computational analysis are detailed in section 2 problem class i viz rapid heat extraction is investigated in section 3 key issue is determining whether elaborate pumping schemes may accelerate extraction section 4 addresses problem class ii viz contained in situ processing and develops a framework for the systematic creation of dynamic processing zones by lcss in the generic case of diffusion conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 problem definition and theoretical framework 2 1 flow and thermal transport model the study concerns fluid and thermal transport in a two dimensional 2d circular subsurface reservoir of radius r where the flow is driven by injection and extraction wells positioned on its perimeter the reservoir consists of an isotropic porous medium characterised by porosity φ and permeability k in which the darcy velocity u is governed by the well known brinkman equation nield and bejan 2006 that assuming typical reservoir conditions as per table 1 reduces to the darcy equation 1 u μ 1 k p with μ the fluid viscosity and p the pressure varghese et al 2017 3 3 velocities can vary widely from v o 0 1 1 m day o 10 6 10 5 m s in groundwater flows stroo 2010 kitanidis 2012 up to v o m hr o 10 3 m s in enhanced oil recovery and egss wang et al 2010 jeanloz et al 2013 incompressible fluid is assumed implying u 0 the darcy velocity relates to the true velocity v within the pores via the dupuit forchheimer relation u φ v nield and bejan 2006 time periodic reservoir flow is set up by systematic reorientation of an injector extractor pair according to metcalfe et al 2010a varghese et al 2017 fig 1a schematically gives the flow vectors for the injector blue and extractor red located on the axis θ π 2 which defines the base flow u 1 systematic reorientation of this base flow by an angle θ

commensurate with 2π such that nθ 2πj with n and j integers yield a time periodic pumping scheme and time periodic flow u x t t period u x t with period time t period n t and consisting of n steps fig 1b e g corresponds with θ n 3π 4 8 the reoriented flow is following metcalfe et al 2010a varghese et al 2017 denoted rotated potential mixing rpm flow hereafter the present study adopts the local thermal equilibrium lte model to describe the heat transfer which is a common approach for darcy type porous media nield and bejan 2006 watanabe et al 2010 shaik et al 2011 rees et al 2008 the lte model assumes thermal equilibrium between the solid and fluid phases implying one global temperature t x t governed by the energy equation 3 ρc m t t ρc f u t k m 2 t with mean volumetric heat capacity ρc m and thermal conductivity k m given by 4 ρc m 1 φ ρc s φ ρc f k m 1 φ k s φ k f where subscripts s and f refer to solid and fluid phase respectively ρ is the density and c is the specific heat nield and bejan 2006 note c p c v c for incompressible fluids the lte model is completed by the uniform high initial temperature t x 0 t h and the low inlet temperature t c t h at the active injector the remaining boundary is adiabatic thus heat extraction occurs through the active extractor well via the enthalpy flux associated with the outflow 2 2 non dimensional model and system parameters the mathematical model 1 and 3 is non dimensionalised by adopting the following scaling for physical quantities primes indicate non dimensional quantities 5 x r x u u u 2 v v v 2 p pp t τt t t ϑ 1 ϑ t h t c t c with r as before v and u φv the characteristic true and darcy velocities respectively p μur 2k the characteristic pressure and τ 2r v 2rφ u the characteristic advective time 4 4 the reservoir parameters in table 1 yield τ 20 days thus t 1 corresponds to an operating time of t 20 days on the reservoir scale which is practically implementable parameter ϑ is the non dimensional inlet temperature that in general equals ϑ 0 yet for computational reasons here is set at the small non zero value ϑ 10 4 this can be done without loss of generality substituting 5 into the above model yields the non dimensional darcy equation v u p revealing that true and darcy velocities identify in the non dimensional representation varghese et al 2017 and the non dimensional lte model 6 t

governing the system becomes φ θ t π pe the porosity is fixed at φ 0 1 in accordance with table 1 and the present study besides the base flow considers two well configurations namely θ n 2π 3 3 and θ n 3π 4 8 denoted 3 step flow and 8 step flow hereafter the latter adequately capture the lagrangian dynamics of generic rpm flows for step durations 1 t 4 metcalfe et al 2010a varghese et al 2017 relevant ranges for π and pe are demarcated below the thermophysical properties of water ρ f 1000 kg m3 c f 4200 j kg k k f 0 6 w m k in conjunction with those of a porous matrix consisting of rock in

yields for typical reservoir conditions as per table 1 characteristic non dimensional thermophysical parameters following table 2 this gives π o 0 1 and pe o 10 2 106 as typical orders of magnitude hence the present study considers fixed π 0 1 and variable pe in the range 102 pe 106 note that primes indicating non dimensional quantities are dropped for brevity below 2 3 numerical simulation of flow and heat transfer the non dimensional darcy equation and lte model are resolved using the commercial cfd package fluent this adopts essentially the same procedure as in varghese et al 2017 by prescribing inlet velocities according to the analytical solution of the rpm flow for isotropic reservoirs numerical complications inherent in explicitly including the point sources sinks that represent the injection extraction wells in this approach are prevented by modelling the latter as arcs with radius r 0 0 1r minor difference with the ansatz in varghese et al 2017 is that here all wells instead of only the active ones are thus incorporated this results in an indented circular perimeter following fig 1c and in consequence a flow domain invariant to reorientation shown velocity field is the base flow satisfying 1 for a dirichlet boundary condition on the injector well described by said analytical solution a standard outflow condition on the extractor well and no slip conditions on the remaining indented boundary the thermal initial boundary conditions given before are imposed by standard fluent options 2 4 methods for dynamics and transport analysis 2 4 1 spectral decomposition of the temperature evolution the temperature evolution governed by 6 can be formally expressed as 7 t x t u t t 0 x k 0 α k ψ k x e μ k t t x 0 k 0 α k ψ k x with u t the perron frobenius pf operator the trailing term constitutes the associated spectral decomposition with μ k ψ k the eigenvalue eigenfunction pairs where eigenvalues are generically complex μ k σ k i ω k and α k the expansion coefficients determined by the initial conditions mezić 2013 kutz et al 2016 the individual terms in the spectral decomposition are the fundamental dynamic states of the temperature evolution and define the so called eigenmodes essentially similar to the fourier decomposition of e g an audio signal into a superposition of elementary waves the spectrum admits ordering as ℜ μ 1 ℜ μ 0 0 implying an exponential decay for each mode with characteristic time τ k 1 ℜ μ k where existence of a non trivial steady state yields μ 0 0 thus eigenmodes generically exhibit damped oscillations with an angular frequency ω k that except for special cases exhibiting mode locking is asynchronous with the periodicity of the rpm flow the mode wise exponential decay at different time scales quickly reduces decomposition 7 to good approximation to a compact set of n leading eigenmodes 8 t x t α 0 ψ 0 x k 1 n α k ψ k x e μ k t that constitute the so called dominant eigenmode s reminiscent of dominant frequencies in an audio signal the concept of dominant eigenmodes finds wide applications in dynamics and transport analyses including advective diffusive thermal transport in flows aref et al 2017 metcalfe et al 2012 lester et al 2008 baskan et al 2015 2 4 2 state space representation of lagrangian and thermal transport lagrangian motion of passive tracers by the flow u can be described as a mapping 9 z t ℱ t z 0 with z t and z 0 the current and initial tracer positions respectively positions are for brevity given in complex notation z x i y in the context of state space representations this enables representation of the global lagrangian transport as the lagrangian motion of an infinite set of passive tracers released at initial positions z 0 z 1 z 2 z p t by the global mapping 10 z t f t z 0 z i t ℱ t z i 0 which constitutes the so called state space representation of the material transport fig 2a here set z 0 is defined such that the flow reorders the positions within the set z 0 ℱ t z i z j 5 5 this condition can always be fulfilled in at least the limit p by realising that a continuous fluid consists of an infinite set of fluid elements this has important ramifications for the analysis hereafter by rendering i the global mapping a linear matrix vector operation and ii f a permutation matrix f t 1 f t t and f t p i speetjens et al 2013 note that f is the adjoint to the mapping matrix describing the global eulerian evolution of concentration fields by distributive mixing speetjens et al 2013 kruijt et al 2001 this mapping matrix and thus f can be constructed from velocity data by the so called mapping method speetjens et al 2013 kruijt et al 2001 temperature evolution 7 admits a similar state space representation 11 t n 1 z 0 u t n z

pf operator and constitutes the generalisation of the above mapping matrix to advective diffusive eulerian transport eigendecomposition u vλv 1 with eigenvalue matrix λ diag ν 1 ν p and eigenvector matrix v v 1 v p enables approximation of the spectral decomposition 7 via 12 ν k e μ k δ t v k ψ k with ψ k ψ k z 1 ψ k z i ψ k z p t the state vector corresponding with eigenfunction ψ k state space representations as 11 enable construction of the spectral decomposition of matrix u and thus approximation of the pf operator u from temperature data by dynamic mode decomposition dmd kutz et al 2016 schmid 2010 chen et al 2012 a major advantage of state space representations is that they constitute matrix vector systems and thus admit linear algebra analyses 3 problem class i rapid heat extraction the analysis below concerns the first problem class of the present study section 1 i e rapid resource extraction which is investigated in terms of heat extraction by injection of a production fluid at low non dimensional inlet temperature t c ϑ 1 in a reservoir initially at uniform high non dimensional temperature t h 1 key to this process is the lagrangian motion of the thermal front bodvarsson 1972 woods and fitzgerald 1993 stopa and wojnarowski 2006 however none of the existing studies on this matter considers the effect of a systematically induced unsteady flow the following concerns a comparative performance analysis of the base flow representing conventional approaches versus rpm flows so as to determine the potential of unsteady reservoir flows for heat scalar recovery 3 1 heat extraction by the base flow the parameter ranges demarcated in section 2 2 revealed that pe 1 and thus in a first approximation heat transfer by diffusion can be neglected this reduces the lte model 6 to 13 lim pe t t π u t d t d t π dt d t 0 with d d t the material derivative relative to thermal velocity u π u and t π t the rescaled time frame relation 13 has the fundamental implications that isothermals in the advective limit pe i travel at thermal velocity u in current time frame t and ii behave as lagrangian fluid fronts travelling at fluid velocity u in time frame t hence 13 can here alternatively be described by the equivalent kinematic equations 14 d x d t u d x d t u with x t the momentary position of a material element that preserves temperature i e t x t t x 0 and is passively advected by the flows u u in the corresponding time frames t t fig 3a gives the temperature evolution t t for pe 106 and thus demonstrates the generic behaviour for pe 1 formation of a sharp thermal front between the remaining hot red and depleted cold blue regions and its propagation by u according to 14 here π 0 1 1 implies that the thermal front lags behind the associated fluid front which is located at shown thermal fronts at rescaled times t π t that travels from injector to extractor this is consistent with findings on egss bodvarsson 1972 woods and fitzgerald 1993 stopa and wojnarowski 2006 this delayed thermal transport and equivalence 14 are particularly relevant for rpm flows section 3 3 and section 4 fig 3b demonstrates the effect of diffusion by the temperature evolution for pe 102 and reveals that its impact consists primarily of smoothing the thermal front however using the intermediate isothermal t c t h 2 green for reference the thermal front as a whole propagates at approximately the same velocity as for pe 1 hence the delay relative to the fluid front is similar for any pe the net heat extraction by the base flow can be described via the integral energy balance corresponding with 6 reading 15 τ d t dt t c t out t t t 1 a a t x t da with t and t out the average reservoir and outlet temperatures respectively and a the domain area parameter τ a πlu defines the non dimensional thermal time constant with l the non dimensional arc length of the wells and u the mean non dimensional injection velocity and equals τ 9 83 for the base flow note that 15 holds for any pe such that diffusive heat flux across the inlet is negligible this condition is met for the present range pe o 10 2 the sharp thermal front in the advective limit fig 3a in conjunction with in a first approximation an assumed instantaneous extraction of said front at t τ a signifying so called thermal breakthrough implies t out t h for t τ a and t out t c for t τ a this yields 16 t a t t c t h t τ t h t τ a t c t τ a as analytical solution to 15 where t a τ a t c advances τ a τ as time of instantaneous thermal breakthrough the corresponding evolutions of t out and t a are in fig 4a and b respectively evolution 16 maintains maximum production temperature t out t h until full heat depletion i e t t c and thus involves the maximum extraction rate ζ a max ζ t h t c τ with ζ d t dt t out t c τ and 0 ζ ζ a hence instantaneous thermal breakthrough for purely advective heat transfer yields the theoretically fastest possible heat extraction and 16 thus sets the lower bound for any temperature evolution t t the actual thermal front in the advective limit pe is extracted in finite time interval t min t t max with t min t max t min π t max π 6 6 19 6 and t min t max 0 66 1 96 the minimum maximum residence times of fluid parcels trefry et al 2012 causing a smooth change over from t out t h to t out t c this results in a sub optimal production temperature t out t h and extraction rate ζ ζ a before full thermal breakthrough and in consequence an overall slower heat extraction compared to the theoretical limit fig 4a b illustrate this for pe 106 where the dashed lines indicate t min max these findings incorporate that ζ 0 ζ a for any configuration diffusion smoothens the thermal front fig 3b and thus progressively advances the onset of a sub optimal production temperature t out t h and extraction rate ζ to t t min with decreasing pe as shown in fig 4a via case pe 102 this further retards the heat extraction and thus implies temperature bounds 17 t a t t t t t with t a the theoretical limit 16 and t the evolution for the advective limit pe fig 4b illustrates inequality 17 using case pe 102 and exposes an only marginal impact of diffusion in the current pe range fig 4a furthermore reveals that the production temperature and thus the extraction rate may for finite pe temporarily exceed that of the advective limit at later stages however this is immaterial for inequality 17 3 2 heat extraction by rpm flows a key difference between rpm flows and the base flow is the formation of multiple thermal fronts in the former due to the systematic switching between active injection extraction wells this is demonstrated in figs 5 and 6 for pe 106 representing the advective limit and pe 102 representing a typical advective diffusive case respectively in the 3 step and 8 step flows however the thermal fronts individually behave essentially similar to those of the base flow sharp fronts travelling at velocity u following 14 for pe 1 akin to fig 3a smoothing of the front in case of significant diffusion akin to fig 3b the multiple thermal fronts result in the emergence and persistence of a central hot region the extent and location of which intimately relates to the lagrangian flow topology this is elaborated in section 3 3 the net heat extraction by the rpm flow remains governed by 15 yet with τ 9 78 and τ 9 54 for the 3 step flow and 8 step flows respectively due to the slight differences in domain shape 6 6 time constant τ being relatively lower for the rpm flow suggests that in the best case scenario of t out t h until instantaneous thermal breakthrough its heat extraction may outperform that of the base flow however the only marginal dependence of τ on the configuration and the in practice negligible size of the wells compared to the reservoir renders this effect negligible hence given the production temperature always satisfies t out t h the fastest heat extraction entirely analogous to the base flow section 3 1 also here corresponds with t out t h until full heat depletion and occurs for instantaneous thermal breakthrough in the advective limit thus 16 with τ a τ defines the lower temperature bound for rpm flows as well the actual thermal front of the base flow is in the advective limit extracted in a finite time interval t min t t max section 3 1 the step wise reorientation of the rpm flow causes a non trivial alignment of thermal fronts with the active extractor and in consequence a first front extraction that generically occurs at t t min signifying an earlier thermal breakthrough and inherently retarded heat extraction compared to the base flow this e g happens during step k 2 1 t 2 and step k 5 4 t 5 of the 8 step and 3 step flow respectively in fig 5 arrows indicate active extractors during these steps thus reservoir temperatures in the actual base flow bf and rpm flow generically are for pe 1 bounded as 18 t a t t bf t t rpm t as demonstrated in fig 7 by case pe 106 comparing the earlier stages of the evolutions in fig 5 versus fig 6 reveals that similar as for the base flow section 3 1 diffusion primarily smoothens the thermal front s yet without appreciable effect on propagation speed this implies that generically temperature bounds 18 are upheld for finite pe which is demonstrated in fig 7 by t rpm for pe 102 106 versus t bf and t a this has the important ramification that the rpm flow is generically outperformed by the base flow with respect to rapid heat extraction conversely well reorientation in reservoirs accommodating rpm like flow is for this purpose ineffective note that since dependence of t bf on pe is marginal in this pe range fig 4b case pe 102 of the base flow is not shown for brevity the impact of diffusion on t rpm on the other hand is significant and may in fact considerably accelerate heat extraction which is particularly apparent for the 8 well flow fig 7a this behaviour is essentially different from the base flow and must be attributed to the non trivial lagrangian flow topology of rpm flows section 3 3 3 3 heat extraction by rpm flows the role of lagrangian transport the essentially different behaviour regarding heat extraction of the rpm flows versus the base flow emanates from the corresponding lagrangian flow topologies the associated lcss namely define the pathways for fluid transport and thus determine the advective thermal transport the lcss for the base flow are the parallel streamlines connecting injector and extractor fig 1a and accomplish unhindered throughflow of the production fluid and in consequence the thermal front fig 3 the lagrangian flow topology in time periodic systems as the rpm flow can be visualised by so called stroboscopic maps of the lagragian motion of the fluid parcels aref et al 2017 the essentials of lcss and their role in transport as well as their visualisation are elaborated in appendix a however crucial in the present context is that advective thermal transport occurs at thermal velocity u π u section 3 1 and is equivalent to lagrangian fluid transport by velocity u in the rescaled time frame t π t according to equivalence 14 this has the fundamental implication that the lagrangian flow topology governing the advective thermal transport in the rpm flow for step duration t corresponds with that of a companion rpm flow for the rescaled duration t π t fig 8a and c give the stroboscopic maps versus the temperature field at t 24 for t π t as indicated and pe 106 for the 8 step and 3 step flows respectively this reveals a clear correlation in that the persistent hot core coincides with one particular lcs i e the central island in the lagrangian flow topology this lcs is special by entrapping fluid in the companion rpm flow such that it never leaves the reservoir and equivalently entrapping thermal energy in the advective limit of the actual rpm flow such that a hot core forms 7 7 such islands are inextricably linked to so called periodic points i e cyclically returning material points according to 43 and fig 19 which are key organising elements of the lagrangian flow topology of time periodic flows 6 relevant here are periodic points of the elliptic type which cause the local formation of islands following fig 19 left said lcs thus demarcates a region that is hydraulically disconnected and in the advective limit thermally disconnected from the wells in the companion and actual rpm flows respectively lcss in the remaining part of the lagrangian flow topology define hydraulically thermally connected regions here fluid is extracted re injected in the companion rpm flow and equivalently thermal energy extracted in the actual rpm flow thus cold annular regions enclosing the hot core gradually form as shown in fig 8 both connected and disconnected lcss play a central role in the second problem class viz in situ processing and are investigated extensively in section 4 here mainly the existence of disconnected lcs s is relevant in that they cause the inferior performance of the rpm versus the base flow regarding heat extraction the thermal energy in these entities is namely inaccessible in the advective limit and in consequence only fraction β 1 α of the total heat can be extracted with α the reservoir fraction occupied by said lcs s this implies for the generic case 0 α 1 an asymptotic reservoir temperature exceeding that of the base flow i e 19 lim t t rpm t t h β t h t c 1 α t c α t h t c lim t t bf t and in conjunction with a common initial extraction rate ζ 0 ζ a and monotonic decay of t temperature bounds 18 for at least the advective limit fig 8b and d give temperature evolution t t for the cases in fig 8a and c respectively demonstrating the monotonic decay towards an asymptotic state 19 proportional to the size of the central island in the corresponding stroboscopic map the impact of the disconnected lcs on both extent of the persistent hot core and retardation in heat extraction is most profound in the 8 step flow due to its substantially greater size compared to the 3 step flow the difference in lcs size and thus the adverse effect on heat extraction between former and latter flows in fact is representative for rpm flows comprising an even and odd number of steps respectively varghese et al 2017 diffusion enables heat transfer across lcs boundaries and thus eliminates the strict partitioning of the reservoir by dis connected lcss hence the persistent hot core of the advective limit gradually releases heat into the surrounding cold annular region through a thermal boundary layer and in consequence progressively diminishes with decreasing pe as demonstrated in fig 9 diffusion thus weakens the impact of the disconnected lcss in that they here retard rather than preclude heat extraction from the core diffusion in this capacity promotes heat release and gives rise to the accelerated heat extraction due to decreasing pe observed for the rpm flows in section 3 2 moreover the reservoir temperature is no longer bound from below by 19 and invariably decays to lim t t rpm t t c lim t t bf t 4 problem class ii in situ processing in contained zones the analysis below concerns the second problem class of the present study section 1 i e in situ processing in contained zones which is investigated in terms of the same thermal configuration as adopted for problem class i section 3 4 1 lcs based in situ processing strategy the emergence of persistent hot cores in the rpm and their intimate relation with certain lcss attributes detrimental for heat extraction section 3 has in fact great potential for in situ processing in contained zones 8 8 the base flow evidently disqualifies for this purpose due to its inability to create internal zones other than a separation by the fluid thermal front consider for illustration a circular body of polluted ground water injection of chemicals via the rpm through e g an enclosing 8 well configuration for t 1 yields assuming negligible diffusion an evolution of the contaminant distribution as in fig 5a where high red and low blue temperatures represent contaminated and treated water respectively this creates a well defined treatment zone that coincides with the hot core and associated disconnected lcs in fig 8a moreover systematic manipulation of the lcs by variation of t facilitates pro active regulation of this zone and or the reaction front defined by its boundary fig 8a in response to the process dynamics lcss namely form adjust almost instantly in the typically highly laminar reservoir flows and thus admit rapid and accurate control by the pumping scheme conversely such controlled reaction fronts enable shielding of designated regions this may e g find application for in situ mining of an ore body partially sitting below an inhabited area that must be shielded from penetration by leaching solutions the cold hot regions in the above example then correspond with mined shielded zones and the treatment zone thus is exterior to the interface dynamic treatment zones and reaction fronts by controlled lcss is an in situ processing capability beyond conventional static methods and lagrangian like methods relying on steady subsurface streamline patterns section 1 the lcs based concept furthermore extends to cases with significant diffusion the latter softens the link between treatment zone and lcss yet a strong correlation remains in the relevant pe range as illustrated in fig 9a for the above example the lagrangian flow topology and intrinsically the lcss namely is fundamentally embedded in the thermal transport hence lcss through their high controllability by the pumping scheme and intimate connection with the temperature field naturally emerge as internal actuators for the pro active and dynamic regulation of the system the above outlined the general principle of lcs based in situ processing on the basis of observations however key to an actual strategy is rigorously capturing the non trivial link between thermal transport and lcss in the generic case of diffusion this relies on two generic methods from dynamical systems theory decomposition of time evolutions into fundamental dynamic states and factorisation of the pf operator into components that each incorporate a physical mechanism of the dynamics former and latter are elaborated specifically for rpm flows in section 4 2 and section 4 3 respectively and employed to establish said link in section 4 4 insights thus gained lay the groundwork for lcs based in situ processing by rpm flows section 4 5 4 2 spectral decomposition of temperature evolutions in rpm flows spectral decomposition expresses temperature evolutions into fundamental dynamic states and thus admits systematic identification of the dominant eigenmodes section 2 4 1 these dominant modes are the first cornerstone of the sought after link between thermal transport and lcss the spectral decomposition of the temperature evolution of the rpm flow is essentially similar to the underlying flow a reorientation of that of the temperature evolution t b of the base flow the latter reads 20 t b x t u b t t 0 x k 0 γ k ϕ k x e λ k t which admits alternative expression as an evolution in spectral space i e 21 t b x t ϕ t x γ t γ t φ b t γ with φ b t diag e λ k t and γ the spectral counterparts to operator u b and initial condition t 0 x respectively rotation operator r r θ r θ θ acting upon a function f x via g x f r n x enables its description in terms of the original and reoriented eigenfunction bases ϕ x and ϕ r n x respectively via 22 f x ϕ t x α ϕ t r n x β β s n α with α and β the corresponding expansion coefficients and s the spectral rotation operator associated with r note that the reoriented eigenfunction basis ϕ r n x identifies with the original eigenfunction basis relative to the reoriented reference frame x n r n x with 1 n n co rotating with the active well pair combination of 21 with 22 enables expression of the step wise temperature evolution in the rpm flow in terms of the base flow decomposition via 23 t x n t ϕ t r n 1 x φ b γ n 1 ϕ t r n x γ n with corresponding spectral space evolution 24 γ n φ γ n 1 φ n γ φ s φ b where γ 0 γ and φ b φ b t thus step wise evolution 23 becomes a periodic evolution in spectral space according to 24 where φ sφ b incorporates the step wise flow and reorientation via φ b and s respectively relations 23 and 24 through property r pn i yield 25 t x pn t ϕ t x φ pn γ u pn t 0 x as corresponding period wise evolution described by pf operator 26 u n t 0 x k 0 α k ψ k x e n μ k t ψ t x α n α n ω n α where eigenfunction eigenvalue pairs ψ k μ k and coefficients α k follow from the eigendecomposition φ vωv 1 this gives 27 ψ t x ϕ t x v diag e μ k t ω α v 1 γ and ψ k x ϕ t x v k with v k the k th eigenvector of φ for the individual eigenfunctions thus 27 links the spectral decompositions 20 and 26 of the base and rpm flow respectively the spectral pf operators relating through 24 via polar decomposition φ sφ b renders this link non trivial hence the leading eigenmodes 8 of rpm flows do not directly follow from those of the base flow consider for illustration the spectral decomposition of the 8 step flow for t 4 and pe 104 which has an evolution akin to figs 5a 6a 8a the two leading modes ψ 1 and ψ 2 obtained by dmd section 2 4 are given in fig 10a and b respectively where the characteristic decay time τ k 1 μ k differs by an order of magnitude τ 2 τ 1 μ 1 μ 2 o 0 1 mode k 0 corresponds with the trivial case ψ 0 μ k t c 0 and is irrelevant here comparison of modes ψ 1 ψ 2 with the corresponding stroboscopic map in fig 10c reveals the distinct yet non trivial connection between thermal and lagrangian transport the slowest decaying mode ψ 1 fig 10a tightly concentrates around the upper island indicated by the red arrow in fig 10c and captures the impact of this lcs on the heat transfer said island is a disconnected lcs and thus retards heat extraction the non zero region of ψ 1 delineates the most persistent part of the corresponding hot core that results from this retardation and defines the zone with maximum thermal confinement decay time τ 1 determines the lifetime of this confinement mode ψ 1 progressively contracts around the upper island with diminishing diffusion not shown and in the advective limit its non zero region strictly coincides with this lcs while lifetime τ 1 becomes unbounded reflecting indefinite heat entrapment the second slowest eigenmode ψ 2 fig 10b correlates with the chain of 3 islands at the corners of the upper island indicated by the cyan arrows in fig 10c this island chain constitutes the set of connected lcss closest to the disconnected lcs underlying the hot core and thus plays a central role in the heat extraction from this region the associated mode ψ 2 namely invades the hot core blue non zero region in fig 10b and via 3 branches each emerging from one of the islands in the chain yellow non zero spikes in fig 10b connects to several of the wells 9 9 the branches in fact emerge from lcss inextricably linked to the islands shown in sec 4 5 2 thus mode ψ 2 governs the thermal interaction between hot core and wells and inherently the heat extraction from the reservoir the contribution of modes ψ k for k 3 not shown to the heat extraction grows increasingly short lived and thus rapidly weakens with growing mode order k due to the progressively increasing decay rate decreasing decay time τ k this also reduces the role of the corresponding lcss in the thermal transport i e basically all entities outside the non zero regions of the leading modes ψ 1 2 which in fig 10c involves the lower island and the bulk of the chaotic sea the above findings reveal that certain lcss are key to the thermal transport yet other lcss are only of secondary importance where the dominant eigenmodes here ψ 1 2 enable systematic isolation of the former to this end the link between lcss and dominant modes is further elaborated in section 4 3 and section 4 4 insights thus attained are in section 4 5 incorporated in an lcs based approach for two key elements of in situ processing thermal confinement section 4 5 1 and thermal interaction section 4 5 2 recasting the step wise evolution 23 through substitution r n x x as 28 t r n x n t ϕ t x γ n ϕ t x φ n γ describes this in the previous co rotating reference frame x n r n x with associated coordinate transformation x r n x connected with the reoriented eigenfunction basis evolution 28 identifies with the period wise evolution 25 implying that the period wise and step wise co rotating dynamics are identical this has the important consequence that the step wise evolutions in co rotating and fixed frames following 28 and 23 respectively are governed by pf operators following 29 t r n x n t u n t 0 x t x n t u n t 0 x with u according to 26 and u its fixed frame counterpart appendix b the corresponding spectral decompositions are explicitly linked via 26 and b 2 which enables the lcs based in situ processing framework elaborated below at both the period wise and step wise levels thus increasing its practical usefulness for enhanced subsurface transport moreover this allows determination of the spectral decomposition from dmd of the co rotating step wise evolutions which is far more efficient and typically less sensitive to noise than dmd based on period wise evolutions step wise dmd for an n step pumping scheme namely requires temperature data only for a time span 0 t t end n compared to 0 t t end for period wise dmd 4 3 thermal versus lagrangian transport in rpm flows the second cornerstone of lcs based in situ processing is the notion that lcss effectively are internal thermal actuators in that they by governing the advective heat transfer enable manipulation and control of the temperature field via the pumping scheme key to utilisation of the lcss for this purpose is determining how exactly they and the pumping scheme access the thermal problem this involves two steps i separation of the total heat transfer into purely thermal transport between and purely lagrangian transport of fluid parcels ii isolation of the lcss relevant to the thermal transport via said separation and the above spectral decomposition the first and second steps are elaborated below and in section 4 4 respectively the above separation of the total heat transfer follows from factorisation of the pf operators in the state space representation of the system section 2 4 2 introduce to this end the specific forms of 10 for the step wise mapping z n ℱ n z 0 in the co rotating frame and the base flow mapping z n ℱ b n z 0 reading 30 z n f b n z 0 z n f n z 0 respectively with z n ℛ n z n the position vector in the co rotating frame and ℛ the global counterpart to rotation operator r 10 10 mappings 30 by virtue of equivalence 14 correspond with both thermal velocity u π u for step duration t and fluid velocity u for step duration t t π the mappings relate consistent with generic reoriented flows via f ℛf b yielding f tot f n as period wise mapping speetjens et al 2006 moreover ℛ is likewise as f b and f section 2 4 2 a permutation operator with properties ℛ n ℐ and ℛ 1 ℛ t the associated global temperature evolutions are described by the state space representation 11 corresponding with the base flow evolution 20 and the step wise rpm evolution 28 relative to the co rotating reference frame this yields 31 t b z 0 u b t 0 z 0 t n ℛ tn z 0 t n z 0 u n t 0 z 0 with t b at t t the pf operators are given by 32 u b q b φ b q b 1 u n q φ n u b ℛ t n with φ b and φ as before q b q z 0 ϕ 0 z 0 ϕ 1 z 0 ϕ k z 0 and q q z 0 with z 0 ℛ n z 0 for any n the eigenfunction bases relative to fixed and co rotating frames respectively refer to appendix c for detailed derivations 11 11 relations z n ℛ n z n and z 0 ℛ n z 0 specifically concern expression of the evolution of the lagrangian positions of passive tracers released at z 0 following 30 and the global eulerian temperature evolution on the discrete fixed positions z 0 following 31 respectively in the co rotating reference frame hence former and latter relations must not identify for arbitrary n the state space representation enables factorisation of the pf operators 32 into two fundamental components according to 33 u b f b t g b g b f b u b u f t g g fu ℛ g b ℛ t where lagrangian factors f b t f t are the adjoints of mappings 30 describing lagrangian transport by distributive mixing section 2 4 2 and thermal factors g b g incorporate thermal boundary conditions bcs and diffusion thermal factors g b and g are the thermal transfer operators that link lagrangian and thermal transport factorisation 33 separates step wise thermal transport t n 1 u t n into the successive action of the thermal and lagrangian factor according to fig 11 thermal factor g via the temperature changes the heat content of the fluid parcels by the thermal bcs here resetting the temperature upon re injection and diffusive heat transfer between fluid parcels t n g t n this process is beyond the direct control of the pumping scheme lagrangian factor f t subsequently redistributes the during this action isothermal fluid parcels by the flow t n 1 f t t n the pumping scheme admits direct control of this process advancing the lcss in their capacity as governing entities for lagrangian transport as internal thermal actuators the factorisation reveals that the lcss and pumping scheme access the thermal problem via the intermediate temperature t n hence lcs based in situ processing effectively controls the evolution from t n to step wise final state t n 1 the prior evolution from t n to t n occurs via diffusion and bcs and is beyond direct control consider for illustration of the factor wise transport the heat transfer in the base flow this embarks on defining the extraction zone ℰ and re injection zone ℐ as the regions via which the extractor injector pair extracts re injects material during a given time span t fig 12a gives the factor wise temperature evolution corresponding with the temperature evolution in fig 3a for pe 106 representing the advective limit due to the alternating action of thermal factor g b t n g b t n and lagrangian factor f b t t n 1 f b t t n u b t n thermal factor g b changes the heat content of the during this step stationary fluid parcels by resetting their temperature in the extraction zone 12 12 extraction zone ℰ includes the boundary segment associated with the injection well bounded by the grey solid arc for t n to inlet temperature t c following 34 g b t b x t c for x ε g b t b x t b x for y ε causing the formation of the cold spots attached to the extraction well in the intermediate temperature fields t n and the thin thermal boundary layer at the injection well in t 0 lagrangian factor f b t subsequently redistributes the during this step isothermal fluid parcels by recycling the extracted reset material in the re injection zone demarcated by the grey dashed arc for t n repeated extraction re injection results in a step wise downward propagation of the thermal front indicated in fig 12a by grey dashed and black solid arcs for t 1 and t 2 respectively that separates cold re injected fluid blue from hot original fluid red fig 12b demonstrates the factor wise temperature evolution for the generic case of diffusion by the evolution for pe 102 fig 8b this reveals behaviour essentially similar to that of the advective limit fig 12a yet now including significant smoothing of temperature gradients due to appreciable diffusive heat exchange between fluid parcels the latter augments the thermal factor to 35 g b dg b with d incorporating the smoothing effect of diffusion and g b the thermal factor in the advective limit according to 34 accounting only for change in heat content of fluid parcels by temperature resetting upon re injection however the close resemblance in the factorisations for pe 106 and pe 102 suggests consistent with the findings in section 3 1 an only localised effect of diffusion in the considered pe ranges hence the action of thermal factor g b here primarily consists of the thermal resetting in the extraction zone demonstrated in fig 12 for t 0 and t 1 the rpm admits an equivalent factorisation of operator u according to 33 and fig 13 demonstrates the factor wise evolution for typical temperature evolutions in the 3 step flow at moderate diffusion pe 104 the factorisation is relative to the co rotating reference frame demonstrated in fig b 21b thus initial intermediate states t n t n and final state t n 1 of a given step n are expressed relative to frames x n and x n 1 r 1 x n respectively this reveals essential similarities with the base flow fig 12 i temperature resetting of the fluid parcels to t c in the extraction zone solid grey curve by thermal factor g via t n g t n ii redistribution of the fluid parcels by their mapping onto the re injection zone dashed grey curve by lagrangian factor f t via t n 1 g t n redistribution here includes step wise reorientation and thus yields shown position of extraction versus re injection zone moreover the impact of diffusion is again restricted to localised smoothing of temperature gradients meaning that also in the rpm flow the action of thermal factor g primarily consists of thermal resetting in the extraction zone this similarity is a direct consequence of the fact that thermal factor g through relation 33 identifies with thermal factor g b of the base flow following 34 and 35 in the initial reference frame x n hence coincidence of the extraction zones for intermediate temperature t n in figs 12 and 13 however an essential difference is that the step wise progression by virtue of the reorientation gradually eats away the interior hot region until a central hot core as shown in fig 9b remains this behaviour is inextricably linked to the lcss and their role in the thermal transport which is elaborated below 4 4 towards an lcs based in situ processing strategy for rpm flows the spectral decomposition of the temperature evolution section 4 2 and factorisation of the step wise heat transfer section 4 3 facilitate determination of the sought after link between thermal transport and lcss required for the lcs based processing strategy section 4 1 the general connection between thermal transport and individual dis connected lcss is established by the factorisation in sections 4 4 1 and 4 4 2 the spectral decomposition is subsequently employed to isolate the subset of dis connected lcss that are relevant for in situ processing in section 4 4 3 4 4 1 connected versus disconnected lcss the factorisation following section 4 3 enables rigorous definition of the two fundamental kinds of entities in the lagrangian flow topology identified in section 3 3 i e connected versus disconnected lcss based on their interaction with the associated extraction re injection zones fig 14 gives the stroboscopic map for the 3 step and 8 step companion rpm flows as a function of t including the extraction blue and re injection cyan zones corresponding with the thermal and lagrangian factors the relative orientation of extraction and re injection zones emanates from the beforementioned reorientation between initial and final states of a given step n lcss partially coinciding with these zones exchange fluid with the wells in the companion flow and constitute hydraulically connected lcss these entities owing to mass conservation invariably connect with both extraction and re injection zones and thus accommodate a circulation akin to that of the base flow lcss outside said zones entrap fluid indefinitely in the companion flow and thus define hydraulically disconnected lcss the hydraulically dis connected lcss of the companion rpm flow define the thermally dis connected lcs in the advective limit of the actual rpm flow section 3 3 here only the central island is a disconnected lcs all others entities are connected lcss 13 13 connected lcss must not necessarily fully coincide with the extraction re injection zones for island chains as those enclosing the central island it e g suffices if at least one island is within said zones the cyclic progression through the chain then always causes material elements within any island to reach the zones and connect with the wells hence the gradual emergence of the hot core in fig 13 exactly on the corresponding island for t 0 1 in fig 14a and the consistent coincidence of said core and island in all the cases shown in fig 8 diffusion softens the link between lcss and temperature field and admits thermal crosstalk between dis connected lcss via the smooth transitions from thermally reset regions blue to unaffected regions red in figs 12 and 13 this underlies the gradual spreading of the hot core across the boundary of the central island in fig 9 4 4 2 thermal transport versus individual dis connected lcss the fundamental connection between thermal and lagrangian transport can be further differentiated to individual dis connected lcss using the property that lcss partition the lagrangian flow topology into disjoint subregions between which no fluid exchange occurs this implies an embedded block diagonal structure of step wise mapping f in 30 which can be exposed by a reordering of the global position vector via z p z with p the permutation operator as per speetjens et al 2013 yielding 36 z n f n z 0 f pfp t bdiag f 1 f j where blocks f j describe the local lagrangian transport of fluid parcels within lcs j e g an island 14 14 relation 36 hinges on the fact that analogous with the spectral decomposition the stroboscopic map s of the period wise and step wise co rotating evolutions identify varghese et al 2017 speetjens et al 2006 restriction of fluid motion to individual lcss reflected in the embedded structure 36 has important implications for the associated thermal transport consider to this end the step wise rpm evolution according to 31 relative to the reordered position vector i e 37 t n ℛ tn z 0 t n z 0 u n t 0 z 0 u pup t f t g using commutation property pℛ n ℛ n p with f following 36 and g pgp t heat exchange between lcss is absent in the advective limit and the thermal factor in consequence adopts the block diagonal structure of the lagrangian factor f i e g bdiag g 1 g j with g j the factor associated with lcs j the identical block diagonal structure of the factors in said limit is imparted on u yielding 38 u f t g bdiag u 1 u j u j f j t g j meaning that the heat transfer is subject to the same lcs wise restriction as the fluid motion where g j depends on the nature of lcs j this signifies a fundamental embedding of the lcss in the advective heat transfer disconnected lcss are thermally isolated implying g j i and thus u j f j t rendering thermal transport equivalent to distributive mixing connected lcss on the other hand accommodate a circulation similar to the base flow implying a thermal factor g j following 34 hence fluid parcels in disconnected and connected lcss maintain the initial temperature and are over several cycles reset to the inlet temperature respectively resulting in a temperature field that is strictly separated by dis connected lcss diffusion results in the beforementioned thermal crosstalk between dis connected lcss and thus lifts the lcs wise restriction of the heat transfer this manifests itself in the breakdown of the above block diagonal structure of the global thermal factor g and inherently u according to 38 the lagrangian factor f t on the other hand retains its block diagonal structure and thereby reflects the fact that the lagrangian flow topology and its partitioning by lcss remains fundamentally embedded in the thermal transport in case of diffusion thus u remains diagonally dominant signifying a strong correlation between lcss and heat transfer in the relevant pe range this pivotal role of lcss in the structure of u and inherently the system dynamics substantiates their designation as internal thermal actuators following fig 11 and naturally advances the proposed lcs based approach as a suitable way for pro active in situ processing 4 4 3 dominant lcss in the thermal transport the example in fig 10 demonstrated that only lcs associated with the dominant modes in spectral decomposition 26 of the temperature evolution are relevant to the thermal transport the link between individual lcss and said evolution established above enables systematic isolation of these lcss denoted dominant lcss hereafter express 26 to this end in terms of state space representation 37 i e 39 t n ℛ tn z 0 u n t 0 z 0 k 0 α k ψ k z 0 e n μ k t where the block diagonal structure 38 of u in the advective limit implies reminiscent of distributive mixing speetjens et al 2013 a strict partitioning of the total set of eigenmodes into subsets that each belong to a given lcs 15 15 this connection between spectral decomposition of the pf operator and its adjoint the koopman operator and composition of the lagrangian flow topology is a fundamental property of advective transport and has e g found application for the isolation and visualisation of lcss froyland et al 2007 budišić and mezić 2012 hence thermal eigenmodes and lcss are spatially inextricably linked moreover the corresponding generically complex eigenvalues μ k σ k i ω k with ℜ μ k 0 section 2 4 1 depend on the kind of lcs heat depletion versus thermal isolation for dis connected lcss namely implies 40 ℜ μ k connected lcss 0 ℜ μ k disconnected lcss 0 meaning that decaying ℜ μ k 0 and invariant ℜ μ k 0 modes are in the advective limit strictly tied to connected and disconnected lcss respectively consistent with the earlier finding that fluid parcels maintain the initial temperature in the former lcss and are reset to the inlet temperature in the latter lcss hence the disconnected lcss constitute the dominant lcss associated with thermal confinement and the connected lcss with the slowest temperature resetting define the dominant lcs governing the thermal interaction between reservoir and wells diffusion by breaking the block diagonal structure 38 softens the link between thermal eigenmodes and lcss thus the former gradually extend beyond the boundaries of the latter thereby establishing couplings between dis connected lcss however eigenmodes and lcss remain spatially closely correlated by virtue of the persisting diagonally dominant structure of u imparted by the lagrangian flow topology section 4 4 2 a given eigenmode therefore stays the strongest within the lcs associated with its advective limit furthermore diffusion by accomplishing global heat depletion causes all eigenvalues to meet ℜ μ k 0 yet the above ordering by dis connected lcss generically persists implying a smooth transition of 40 into 41 max ℜ μ k connected lcss max ℜ μ k disconnected lcss 0 upon departure from the advective limit thus the above roles of the disconnected and connected lcss as dominant lcss for thermal confinement and thermal interaction respectively are generically preserved upon introducing diffusion the example in fig 10 demonstrates these characteristics the first leading eigenmode ψ 1 is linked with the central island i e the sole disconnected lcs and given moderate diffusion slightly extends beyond its boundary while marginally departing from the advective limit μ 1 0 for the associated eigenvalue the second leading eigenmode ψ 2 closely correlates with one of the island chains surrounding the central island and given ψ 2 connects with the wells designates this a connected lcs coincidence of non zero regions of ψ 1 and ψ 2 with both lcss reflects coupling due to diffusion however each mode clearly remains the strongest within its associated lcs furthermore relation μ 2 μ 1 signifies consistency with inequality 41 4 5 lcs based in situ processing by rpm flows the common objective for generic in situ processing problems is creation of a well defined processing zone and associated boundary section 4 1 such zones correspond in the present thermal context with subsurface regions that reminiscent of the persistent hot cores mentioned before maximally confine heat and maintain the initial temperature thermal confinement essential to in situ processing furthermore is scalar exchange and interaction between processing zone and wells here this consists of heat transfer between former and latter thermal interaction the link between thermal and lagrangian transport established in section 4 4 lays the groundwork for lcs based in situ processing by rpm flows by enabling systematic demarcation and characterisation of thermal confinement zones and thermal interaction channels and association with specific dis connected lcss for the generic case of diffusion this is elaborated for thermal confinement and interaction in sections 4 5 1 and 4 5 2 respectively 4 5 1 thermal confinement the beforementioned central island is the sole disconnected lcs in the considered rpm flows and thus the dominant lcs associated with thermal confinement the leading eigenmode ψ 1 is by virtue of inequality 41 inextricably linked to this lcs and its non zero regions thus demarcate the associated thermal confinement zone in the generic case of diffusion fig 10 clearly demonstrates this essential connection and close correlation between leading eigenmode ψ 1 and said island the thermal confinement mode ψ 1 versus the lagrangian flow topology right column is given in fig 15 for the 8 step flow as a function of the pumping scheme step duration t and pe this reveals the persistence of a thermal confinement zone throughout parameter space that continues to be shaped by the central island irrespective of considerable changes in its extent and location with varying conditions diffusion renders the correlation between thermal mode ψ 1 and island progressively non trivial yet a clear link and ability for confinement exists for pe o 10 3 this parameter range encompasses most practical cases the constancy of this link for a wide pe range reveals that lcss indeed act as internal thermal actuators following fig 11 this supports the working principle of the lcs based approach by demonstrating that the association of a thermal confinement mode with dominant disconnected lcs s facilitates even for significant diffusion well controlled creation and regulation of an in situ processing zone fig 16 shows the thermal confinement mode for given pumping scheme and pe versus the lagrangian flow topology right column in the 3 step flow this exposes an equally strong and robust correlation between thermal confinement mode and central island and thus substantiates the above findings and in turn the generality and potential of the lcs based approach note that the 3 step flow belongs to the generic class of configurations with an odd number of steps which accommodate far smaller disconnected islands compared to even step configurations as e g the above 8 step flow 16 16 the wells in the odd step configurations act either as source or as sink this promotes short circuiting of the fluid transport between adjacent source sink pairs and leaves comparable little room for the formation of a central island entrapping fluid wells in even step configurations on the other hand continuously alternative between source and sink functions and thus tend to slosh fluid back and forth through the same well this promotes fluid entrapment and in consequence formation of a large central island refer to varghese et al 2017 for details this generically tends to render odd step flows less suitable for establishment of thermal confinement zones however diffusion may expand the latter to similar sizes as in even step flows compare e g case t pe 4 10 4 for the 8 step versus 3 step flow in figs 15e and 16c respectively hence odd step flows may be equally effective for thermal confinement as their even step counterparts thus increasing the processing capabilities in case of significant diffusion the thermal confinement zones accomplish maximal yet not indefinite confinement of heat in the generic case of diffusion due to the heat exchange between dis connected lcss for finite pe section 4 4 2 hence a given temperature distribution has a characteristic decay time or equivalently lifetime τ 1 1 μ 1 with μ 1 the eigenvalues corresponding with ψ 1 in figs 15 and 16 for the application examples in section 4 1 lifetime τ 1 determines the required treatment time for contaminated groundwater or dissolved minerals within the confinement zone or the safe operating window for in situ recovery exterior to said zone fig 17 shows the relative lifetime τ 1 τ 1 t 1 μ 1 t versus pe and t revealing consistent with weaker diffusion retarding heat release an increase with pe approximately following the power law τ 1 pe n indicated by lines the rate of increase is comparable i e n 0 55 0 6 for all t in the 8 step flow signifying an only marginal dependence on the pumping scheme fig 17a the 3 step flow on the other hand is far more sensitive to pe for higher t fig 17b compare to this end n 0 25 for t 2 versus n 0 44 for t 4 moreover the relative lifetime for given pe depends significantly on both pumping scheme and well configuration as demonstrated in fig 17c for τ 1 at pe 103 dashed vertical line in fig 17a and b and again follows a power law i e τ 1 t n curves with n 0 76 and n 1 51 for the 3 step and 8 step flows respectively hence increasing the step duration t considerably reduces the relative lifetime τ 1 this must be attributed to the increasingly chaotic environment which promotes thermal transport surrounding the central island with increasing t π t figs 15 and 16 these findings reveal a strong and non trivial dependence of the confinement abilities on the flow conditions the 8 step flow yields substantially higher lifetimes signifying stronger confinement because of the far larger central island compared to the 3 step flow yet has a much greater sensitivity to t enabling greater variation and flexibility of operating conditions due to the considerable decrease in island size with longer step durations hence the optimal well configuration and pumping scheme depend on the particular purpose and goals the strong link between thermal confinement mode and corresponding lcs in any case admit robust and accurate regulation of this process 4 5 2 thermal interaction thermal interaction relies essentially on thermal transport between wells and hot core and thus connected lcss come into play the spectral decomposition enables systematic identification of the underlying transport paths and relevant lcss thermal interaction by virtue of inequality 41 namely is dominated by the slowest decaying mode that appreciably extends from the central island into the connected lcs s the link between thermal eigenmodes and lcss established in section 4 4 3 implies an accompanying dominant lcs that via the lcs based actuation following fig 11 facilitates regulation of the thermal interaction reconsider to this end the example shown in fig 10 the second leading eigenmode ψ 2 fig 10b clearly connects the hot core with the wells via the 3 emerging branches and thus defines this thermal interaction mode the investigation below demonstrates that the latter generically coincides with mode ψ 2 and isolates the associated connected lcss fig 18a and b give typical thermal interaction modes ψ 2 for the 3 step flow in the thermal confinement range pe o 10 3 for t 1 versus the lagrangian fluid exchange between wells and reservoir in the companion rpm flow at t 0 1 fig 18c the latter is visualised by the stroboscopic map of a single tracer released just outside the disconnected island centred on the green marker indicating the corresponding elliptic periodic point following appendix a and exposes a continuous circulation past this entity via local gyres indicated by blue arrows in fig 18c driven by adjacent injector extractor pairs this sets up three incoming jets of cold fluid each comprising two counter rotating gyres emanating from injectors 1 3 5 and impinging upon the central island these cold jets thus extract heat from the hot core and constitute the connected lcss that dictate the thermal interaction the non zero regions of the corresponding thermal interaction modes that extend from the hot core coincide with the outgoing hot jets and thus delineate the transport paths for advective heat transfer from hot core to extractors 2 4 6 comparing fig 18a and b reveals that the impact of diffusion is restricted to widening of the connecting paths between core and extractors the formation of gyres by adjacent injector extractor pairs is generic for odd step flows at lower step durations varghese et al 2017 hence thermal interaction modes for n step configurations describe essentially similar patterns as in fig 18a and b yet consisting of n branches extending away from the hot core to the extractors the thermal interaction mode ψ 2 changes dramatically upon increasing the step duration t as demonstrated in fig 18d for pe 103 and t 4 due to a fundamental change in the lagrangian fluid motion the stroboscopic map in fig 18e namely reveals the emergence of a chain of 3 periodic points cyan stars i e cyclically returning material points according to a 2 and fig 20b around the disconnected island centred on the green marker these periodic points are of the hyperbolic type complementary to said elliptic point and determine the lagrangian fluid transport by their associated lcss i e the stable and unstable manifolds following fig 20c right 17 17 such manifolds are the actual lcss from which the 3 branches in fig 10 b emerge they are nonetheless inextricably linked with the 3 island chain at the corners of the upper island in that island chains invariably coexist with chains of hyperbolic points and associated manifolds in the lagrangian flow topologies of 2d incompressible flows aref et al 2017 the un stable manifolds and the impact upon the transport are visualised by the stroboscopic map of a minute circle of tracers black markers released on the upper hyperbolic point the earlier stages of said stroboscopic map outline segments of the unstable manifold red markers the reflections about the symmetry axis dashed line by virtue of time reversal symmetry outline segments of the corresponding stable manifold blue markers varghese et al 2017 aref et al 2017 the un stable manifolds delineate the principal transport directions indicated by blue arrows and set up the fluid exchange between wells and central region as well as the local circulation around the disconnected island associated with the latter 18 18 neighbouring hyperbolic points are always connected by a stable and unstable manifold segment this reflects so called heteroclinic manifold interaction aref et al 2017 this construct of hyperbolic points and manifolds defines the dominant connected lcss associated with the thermal interaction mode ψ 2 outflux of hot fluid occurs via the unstable red manifold segments extending from hot core to extractors 4 6 influx of cold fluid occurs via the stable blue manifold segments between hot core and injectors 1 3 19 19 the unstable red and stable blue manifold segments attached to injector 3 and extractor 4 respectively interact heteroclinically with manifolds of opposite stability extending from the core thus said unstable manifold segments dictate the advective heat transfer from core to extractors and shape the thermal interaction mode ψ 2 in a similar way as the outgoing hot jets in fig 18c shape the modes in fig 18a and b the manifold construct in fig 18e reveals that the thermal interaction between central region and wells happens primarily through injectors 1 3 and extractors 4 6 moreover the complex eigenvalue μ 2 σ 2 i ω 2 with σ 2 0 42 and ω 2 2 20 signifies a thermal interaction dominated by an oscillatory advective heat flux asynchronous with the step wise switching of the pumping scheme the period time of the former namely equals t 2 π ω 2 2 86 t this reflects the non trivial interaction between advective and diffusive heat transfer the thermal interaction modes versus lagrangian flow topologies for the 8 step flow under the same thermal conditions are shown in fig 19 this exposes a fundamental difference with the above in that irrespective of the step duration the dominant connected lcss here always comprise of manifold constructs akin to that in fig 18e fig 19c and e give these constructs for t 0 1 and t 0 4 respectively and reveal an essentially similar composition a chain of hyperbolic points cyan stars surrounding the disconnected island centred on the green marker that via the associated stable blue and unstable red manifolds again sets up fluid exchange between central region and wells and a local circulation the invariable emergence of such constructs stems from the fact that the lagrangian flow topology for even step flows instead of gyres as in fig 18c tends towards a global island for diminishing t varghese et al 2017 hence the confinement zone and its immediate environment is topologically the same for any t and the advective heat transfer is therefore always dictated by the unstable red manifold segments for lower step durations this gives rise to a large scale advective circulation zone around the central region and the emergence of hot plumes extending towards the wells as demonstrated in fig 19a and b where diffusion merely has a smoothing effect higher step durations cause a progressive diminution of the central island in favour of an expanding manifold construct as shown in fig 19e for t 4 the resulting outflux and influx of hot cold fluid and thus the advective heat transfer increasingly concentrate around the un stable manifold segments extending from hot core to wells 6 8 and 1 3 respectively as demonstrated in fig 19d for t 4 and pe 103 the manifold construct thus reveals that wells 1 3 and 6 8 though wells in even step flows alternately act as injector and extractor predominantly behave as injectors and extractors respectively the complex eigenvalue μ 2 σ 2 i ω 2 with σ 2 0 41 and ω 2 2 37 signifies as observed before for the 3 step flow oscillatory thermal transport that given period time t 2 π ω 2 2 65 t is asynchronous with the step wise switching of the pumping scheme the thermal interaction mode of the 8 step flow in fig 19d including the corresponding eigenvalue μ 2 is strikingly similar to its counterpart in the 3 step flow following fig 18d and together with increasingly comparable thermal confinement zones section 4 5 1 implies a growing similarity in the confinement characteristics for higher step durations this must be attributed to the increasingly similar lagrangian flow topologies evident from comparing fig 18e and fig 19e and in particular the manifold construct around the central island that governs the advective heat transfer from the confinement zone this corroborates the crucial role of a small and well identifiable set of dominant lcss in the thermal transport and thus lends further support to the proposed lcs based approach as per fig 11 for robust and accurate regulation of in situ processing 5 conclusions the study investigates scalar transport in enhanced subsurface flows driven by injection and extraction wells for two generic transport problems of great practical relevance i rapid scalar extraction and ii contained in situ processing these transport problems are without loss of generality examined in terms of the thermal transport in a two dimensional 2d circular subsurface reservoir with a darcy type flow driven by injection and extraction wells positioned on its perimeter considered are steady flow due to a static injector extractor pair base flow and time periodic flows due to reoriented well pairs rpm flow lagrangian fluid transport is key to the problems of interest due to their generically advection dominated nature and thus the notion of lagrangian coherent structures lcss is adopted for in depth analyses and development of new concepts for subsurface flow engineering heat extraction is governed by the lagrangian motion of the thermal front the latter reaching one of the extraction well s signifying thermal breakthrough reduces the production temperature and by virtue of energy conservation the heat extraction compared to the pre breakthrough stage thus the base flow in case of instantaneous thermal breakthrough and purely advective heat transfer yields the theoretically fastest heat extraction any other configuration is invariably slower moreover the base flow generically outperforms rpm flows regarding heat extraction meaning that well reorientation in rpm like reservoir flow is for this purpose ineffective diffusion retards heat extraction in the base flow yet generically accelerates this process in rpm flows the essentially different behaviour of the rpm flows stems from the existence of island like lcss that disconnect regions from the extraction wells by entrapping fluid in the reservoir interior such disconnected lcss entrap heat indefinitely in the advective limit diffusion promotes heat release from these entities yet they nonetheless retard heat extraction compared to the base flow this explains both the underperformance of rpm flows relative to the base flow and the reduction in performance gap between former and latter with stronger diffusion heat entrapment by disconnected lcss in rpm flows attributes detrimental for heat extraction has in fact great potential for in situ processing in contained zones lcs via a mathematical technique known as operator factorisation are namely shown to be fundamentally embedded in the thermal transport and given they admit rapid and accurate control by the pumping scheme thus naturally emerge as internal actuators for the creation of dynamic processing zones and reaction fronts two key elements of in situ processing viz the formation of a thermal confinement zone and its interaction with the wells by advective heat transfer are rigorously linked to specific lcss by so called spectral decomposition of the temperature evolution into fundamental dynamic states eigenmodes this enables akin to determination of dominant frequencies in an audio signal by fourier analysis isolation of two eigenmodes that govern confinement and interaction for the generic case of diffusion first a thermal confinement mode demarcating the effective confinement zone associated with the beforementioned disconnected lcs second an accompanying thermal interaction mode demarcating the channels of advective heat transfer between said zone and the wells the connected lcss corresponding with these channels are material curves manifolds emanating from a chain of cyclically returning material points hyperbolic points surrounding the confinement zone these manifolds delineate the principal transport directions away from this zone the approach adopted for scalar transport in rpm flows generalises to more complex subsurface systems the formation of lcss occurs for any fluid transport subject to continuity and mass conservation irrespective of e g fluid rheology or domain geometry moreover only limited sets of lcss are permissible for a given flow class the lagrangian flow topology of 2d incompressible reservoir flows e g always consists of the same two elementary building blocks as encountered in the rpm flows islands and chaotic seas case specific is only their particular arrangement anisotropy e g has a major impact on this arrangement in rpm flows varghese et al 2017 the eigenmode structure of the corresponding temperature evolutions and its intimate connection with the lcss is equally generic heterogeneity and the typically non fickian scalar transport ensuing from this berkowitz et al n d neuman and tartakovsky 2009 dentz et al 2011 lester et al 2016 dentz et al 2016 though significantly impacting the dynamics does not fundamentally alter this generic behaviour furthermore lagrangian and scalar transport in essentially 3d systems though dynamically far richer exhibits similar generic properties and structures aref et al 2017 hence investigation and characterisation of subsurface transport by lcss and associated eigenmodes as well as the proposed lcs based in situ processing in principle is applicable to any reservoir flow key premise for in situ processing is the existence of disconnected lcss parametric studies on the lagrangian flow topology using stroboscopic maps offer a systematic way to identify such conditions in generic reservoir flows the above framework admits relatively straightforward integration into computational tools for subsurface transport analyses and development of reservoir management scheme due to the data based nature of the employed methods the thermal confinement interaction modes that characterise confinement can be isolated from temperature data by the data analysis technique dynamic mode decomposition the corresponding lcss can be visualised by stroboscopic maps constructed from velocity data both temperature and velocity data can be obtained via conventional cfd making the methodology as applied to rpm flows in this study

transport analyses refer to haller 2015 aref et al 2017 for background and details in time periodic flows a common way to visualise the lagrangian motion of passive tracers described by 9 is via so called stroboscopic maps 20 20 alternatively denoted poincaré sections in literature aref et al 2017 such maps consist of the sequence of positions at the end of each period i e a 1 s z 0 z 0 z 1 z k

similar to streamlines in steady flows and are always organised into elementary structures viz said lcss such maps can be readily constructed by computational tracking routines using velocity data from e g conventional cfd varghese et al 2017 lcss are in stroboscopic maps inextricably linked with so called periodic points that is passive tracers cyclically returning to their initial position after p periods i e a 2 z k ℱ t period k z 0 as illustrated in fig 20b for p 1 and p 3 two kinds of periodic points exist in 2d flows elliptic and hyperbolic points elliptic points are the center of islands formed by closed concentric orbits as shown in fig 20c left these islands thus entrap fluid and are the associated lcss that travel along with the elliptic points during their excursions following fig 20b hyperbolic points are the origin of two special material curves that define the principal stretching red and contraction blue directions in the flow region they inhabit following fig 20c right former and latter curves define the so called unstable manifold and stable manifold of the hyperbolic point these lcss in time periodic flows typically cause so called chaotic advection that is the exponential deformation of material fluid regions and in consequence rapid dispersion of passive tracers by repeated stretching and folding of fluid parcels thus hyperbolic points through their manifolds generically cause the formation of chaotic seas fig 20 lagrangian coherent structures lcss in the stroboscopic maps of time periodic flows islands of elliptic points unstable red and stable

1582,colloid contaminants are widely distributed in surface runoff from crop land and can be effectively removed by vegetative filter strips vfs whose quantification however proves difficult standard mechanism based models contain many unknown parameters with intrinsic uncertainty limiting their applicability and potential extension for other environmental conditions and colloid contaminant types to remedy this limitation and capture the complex dynamics of colloids through the soil vegetation system this study proposes a parsimonious particle plugging tempered fractional advection dispersion eq p tfade with a few empirical parameters which is built upon the promising fractional calculus engine the p tfade model extends the promising tempered fractional derivative model by incorporating a plugging term which is then proved to be able to capture both the plugging dynamics and tailing behavior of colloids under various hydrologic and geochemical conditions applications also show that the two critical parameters in the p tfade model the time index α and plugging coefficient kp can efficiently characterize the impact of the flowrate and ionic condition on transport of different sized colloids observed in our laboratory in addition the vegetation type determines the overall structure of the soil vegetation system whose impact on the colloid removal efficiency can be quantified by adding a parameter λ in the physical model therefore the novel p tfade model can reduce the model uncertainty and help us further understand the nature of colloid dynamics through dense vegetation and soil systems keywords colloid transport soil vegetation system tempered fractional model plugging process tailing behavior removal efficiency 1 introduction dense vegetation or vegetative filter strips vfss can reduce colloids contamination in surface runoff from non point source pollution gharabaghi et al 2006 sabbagh et al 2009 yuan et al 2009 arora et al 2010 dousset et al 2010 veum et al 2011 otto et al 2012 olilo et al 2016 yu et al 2019 colloids are particles with at least one dimension smaller than 10 um mobile colloids in the surface runoff have adverse effects on the water quality either directly as contaminants or by facilitating the other highly reactive contaminants like metal or oxidized metal mobile colloids in the hydrological path present a public health risk beck et al 2013 cao 2011 vfss which can be either natural or implanted grass or meadows are widely used to retain the sediment or solute contaminants and it was proved that colloids can be also effectively immobilized either in the soil profile or deposited on the surface of vegetations wu et al 2011 yu et al 2011 yu et al 2012 the key to evaluating a vfs system is to determine the removal efficiency of colloids which can be done by developing quantitative models in addition to laboratory field experiments evaluating this efficiency motivated this study mechanism based models have experienced difficulty when quantifying the mass of colloids remaining in the soil profile and on the surface of dense vegetation in complex physical and chemical environments particularly they have limited adaptability when capturing different late time tailing behaviors of colloid transport under various environmental conditions and or colloid types the soil vegetation system can be conceptualized as a two layer porous medium containing the soil and the vegetation for each layer the flow route and physical transport of colloids within the interconnected soil vegetation system can be complex to effectively model this complex system multiple processes must all be considered including the flow dynamics and colloid exchange between the two layers of the porous medium and the concurrent horizontal flow and colloid transport to capture each of these processes at least one model parameter is needed if the mechanism based models are used when the physical and or chemical environment such as the type of colloid and vegetation the flow rate and or ionic strength changes parameters in the mechanism based model have to be adjusted accordingly yu et al 2013 constraining the model s adaptation capability in addition the mechanism based models have limited predictability considering 1 the large number of model parameters and the associated uncertainty and 2 the intrinsic heterogeneity of vegetation and soil alternative physical models with less empirical parameters are therefore needed to efficiently quantify the distribution of various types of colloids in the soil vegetation system one potential stochastic model to quantify colloids moving through the vfs is the promising fractional derivative equation fde model which was built upon the fractional calculus and applied by hydrologists to capture non fickian or anomalous transport of pollutants in natural aquifers with multi scale heterogeneity zhang et al 2014 wei et al 2016 wei et al 2017 meerschaert et al 2008 the fde replaces the integer order derivative in space time or both in the standard advection dispersion equation ade with a fractional order derivative to describe the memory impact in contaminant transport from different factors for example multiple rate sorption desorption schumer et al 2003 it is a parsimonious upscaling model with a few parameters which can simulate complex transport processes driven by multi scale medium heterogeneity that cannot be exhaustively mapped by standard mechanism based models metzler and klafter 2000 cvetkovic cvetkovic 2011 found that the waiting time distribution of many hydrologic processes can be described by a universal density function the single side tempered stable density whose scaling limit is governed by the time tempered fractional advection dispersion equation tfade meerschaert et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 to the best of our knowledge the fde and tfade have not been applied to model colloid transport through dense vegetation and soil systems this is because the standard fde or tfade needs to be improved before it can efficiently capture the dynamics of both mobile and immobile colloids in the complex vfs system this study aims to fill the knowledge gap mentioned above by developing a novel fde model to capture the plugging process and tailing behavior of colloid transport in the complex vfs system applicability of this model will then be checked against colloid dynamics observed in the laboratory under controlled environmental conditions including colloid size flow rate ionic strength and vegetation type detailed comparison with the tfade and mechanism based models will also be shown to determine the feasibility of the new model and improve our understand of the nature of colloid dynamics in the vfs system 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment description the experimental material setup and procedure can be found in yu et al 2013 here we briefly introduce them the carboxylated polystyrene latex microsphere which is commonly used as surrogates for both abiotic and biotic natural colloids were used in the experiments quartz sand silica has a size varying from 0 5 mm to 0 6 mm bulk density of 1 54 g cm3 and porosity of 0 3 the silica sand was then packed in a soil box with a dimension of 20 3 cm in length 19 1 cm in width and 9 9 cm in depth two turf grasses bahia paspalum notatum and perennial ryegrass lolium perenne l were selected as the experimental grasses because of their differing root and stem systems the average distance between the stems was less than 2 cm and the height of the dense vegetation was 8 cm conservative tracer experiments using bromide were first conducted as a control test to quantify the water distribution in the system colloids experiments with different sizes and physical chemical biological conditions were then conducted the system first did not consider any drainage after the soil was saturated with colloid free water and the flow rate stabilized bromide tracer with colloids were injected into the system continuously for 10 min the injection was then switched to regular colloid free water for 20 min to flush out the mobile colloids and bromide 2 2 stochastic model development the stochastic model should be able to account for the variation of the recovery rate for collides due to the change of the colloid particle size and environmental conditions or in other words the model should capture the breakthrough curves btcs of the colloids especially the peak concentration value and the tailing behavior which is one of the major characteristics of anomalous transport which are affected significantly by the colloid and environmental properties a plugging sink term therefore is added to the tfade model leading to the following particle plugging tempered fractional advection dispersion eq p tfade model c t β e λt α t α e λt c βλ α c d 2 c x 2 v c x s plug where s plug is the plugging sink term which varies with the colloid size and the other physic chemical conditions here c is the colloid concentration d denotes the effective dispersion coefficient v is mean flow rate β is the fractional capacity coefficient which can be approximated by the volume ratio of the vegetation soil system to the underlying flow namely β v soil v water α is the order of the time fractional derivative indicating the delay effect of the vegetation soil system to the colloids and λ is the truncation parameter which defines the time when the colloid s tailing behavior in the btc transfers from the power law distribution to an exponential distribution meerschaert et al 2008 schumer et al 2003 the term s plug in the above p tfade model is added to quantify the overall impact of the detailed medium and colloid properties which sometimes are too detailed to be measured exhaustively on the kinetics of colloids especially the colloid concentration soil porosity η average of colloid particle size dp average of soil particle size ds and other physical chemical effect caused by plant roots and soil system hence the plugging sink term can take the following form s plug kp η in dp ds 1 c where kp is the plugging coefficient which represents the physical chemical effects on colloid plugging such as soil properties ionic condition vegetation type flow rate and the coupling effect of vegetation roots and soil system in addition due to the relatively low concentration of colloids and the short duration of the experiment the variation of soil porosity with time was not considered in this study in the following we will test extensively the feasibility of this formula for s plug it is noteworthy that there is no quantitative correlation between the recovery rate and the plugging amount or in other words plugging only accounts for part of the collides removed from the solution i e 1 recovery rate m plug m total this is because factors e g physic chemical or biological processes gamerdinger and kaplan 2001 bradford et al 2003 rinck pfeiffer et al 2000 corapcioglu et al 1999 which differ from the plugging effect also retain the colloids in the soil vegetation system during the experimental period while some of the colloids continue to flow out of the soil 3 results and discussion in this section we show the experimental results by yu et al 2013 and explore the impact of colloid size flow rate ionic strength and grass type on collides kinetics the laboratory experiments mentioned above provide the data to check the applicability of the p tfade model additionally the p tfade model is compared with the tfade model and the standard mechanism based model yu et al 2013 referred to as yu s model herein for simplicity to explore the impact of the various factors mentioned above on the colloid migration behavior note that yu s model was built based on fick s law and contained linear mass exchange terms which are the core used by the standard popular transport models such as tsm transient storage model therefore it can be regarded as a standard mechanism based model 3 1 effect of colloid size the sizes of colloids used by yu et al 2013 were 0 3 um 2 um and 10 5 um respectively with a flowrate of 84 ml min and low ionic strength the three sizes were selected since they represent distinct deposition or removal prediction accuracy based on the classical dlvo named after derjaguin landau verwey and overbeek theory molnar et al 2015 the particle size has a profound impact on colloid dynamics especially the mass exchange and deposition for colloids the smaller the size of colloids the larger the theoretical deposition compared to the experimental colloid deposition coefficient in terms of the mass exchange process between vegetation and the soil profile a larger quantity of smaller colloids could diffuse or advect with the surface flow into the soil profile in relation to the deposition process however it is more difficult for the smaller colloids to deposit on the surface of grass or soil grains probably due to the lower weight for the smaller colloids while it is easier for the smaller colloids to re mobilize likely driven by the sheer stress of the flow notably it takes less energy for the smaller colloids trapped by the vfs system to become re mobile molnar et al 2015 tufenkji and elimelech 2004 therefore the btc late time tail for the smaller colloids consisting mainly of the re mobilized particles is heavier than the late time tail for larger colloids in addition in term of straining the larger colloids might be blocked between the soil grains easier due to the accumulation effect bradford et al 2013 in the observed btcs the peak value representing the partition of most mobile particles can reflect the colloid s overall retention ability in the soil vegetation system while the shape of the btc late time tailing formed by re mobilized particles at late times reflects the ability of colloids to be released from the soil profile and the dense vegetation system back into the surface water first we compare the tfade model and the p tfade model in fig 1 since the tfade model has no plugging term the total mass of colloids remains stable this causes the btc s peak simulated by the tfade model higher than the experimental data contrarily the p tfade model can well describe the variation of the peak value due likely to colloids plugging the plugging term mainly affects the btc s peak and has little effect on its tail because of the following reasons first the colloid particles plugged in the vfs system cannot be released back to the mobile system second the plugging term is proportional to the colloid concentration in summary the tempered fractional derivative engine can well capture the complex late time tailing behavior of colloid transport while the plugging term can characterize the clogging process of colloids we propose the p tfade model by combining the promising tfade and the plugging term to better describe the migration of colloids in the vfs system in the following sections we will focus on the evaluation and comparison of the p tfade model and yu s model as shown by fig 2 both the p tfade model and yu s model can fit the peak portion of colloids btcs but at the late time tailing portion t 1000s the colloidal concentration calculated by yu s model is lower than the experimental data in addition the p tfade model requires fewer fitting parameters to describe various late time tailing behaviors sensitive to the colloids size the two empirical parameters in the p tfade model which are the time index α and the plugging coefficient kp may quantify the impact of the colloid size on the fate and transport of colloid in the vegetation soil system the p tfade model simplifies the soil vegetation system to be a black box so that effective or empirical parameters can be used to significantly simplify the quantification of dynamics of colloids moving in the vfs system with varying properties the time fractional order α indicating the delay effect of the vegetation soil system on colloid movement increased with increasing colloid sizes i e the best fit index α is 0 80 0 81 and 0 88 for the colloids with a dimension of 0 3 um 2 0 um and 10 5 um respectively the plugging coefficient kp characterizing the uncertain physical chemical effect on colloids plugging decreased from 2 2 to 0 35 when the colloid size increased from 0 3 um to 10 5 um table 1 the other model parameters remained relatively stable for example when the experimental flowrate was 84 ml min with low ionic strength through the bahia grass most parameters in the p tfade model remained stable including η 0 3 β 1 9 d 0 2 cm2 s λ 0 0007s 1 and ds 550 um table 1 therefore by adjusting α and kp the p tfade can model the transport of a wide variety of colloids in the vfss it is noteworthy that the truncation parameter λ in the p tfade model captures the trend of the late time tailing phenomenon of btcs numerical results not shown here revealed that λ did not change significantly when the colloid size varies it might be due to two reasons first after the soil vegetation type is fixed the soil structure was alike resulting in a similar late time tailing for all the btcs second the experiment time was relatively short and the concentration decline of colloids had not yet transitioned from the power law rate to the exponential rate therefore we would not see a change in λ for various colloid sizes for the soil bahia experiments the best fit λ ranges from 0 00068 to 0 00073 s 1 a smaller λ e g 0 0001 s 1 can control the tailing behavior of colloids after 10 000 s 1 λ 1 0 0001 10 000 s however the relatively short experiments less than 2500 s did not monitor any late time behavior after t 2500 s hence the value of λ listed in table 1 was selected as 0 0007 moreover when the vegetation changed λ varied from 0 0007 to 0 0025 implying that the hysteresis effect of the two soil vegetation systems on colloids might be different to summarize the truncation parameter λ did not vary with colloid size when the other environmental condition remained unchanged the sum of the blocked colloid mass in the vegetation soil system differed significantly among the colloids with different sizes fig 3 the blocking rate was faster for the larger colloids the instantaneous blocking amount and the total plugging quantity of colloids trapped in the soil vegetation system varied with time according to the p tfade model the term that accounts for the colloids trapped in the soil profile increased from 0 95 to 27 6 with an increasing colloid size corresponding to the reduced recovery rate varying from 72 1 to 56 4 3 2 effect of ionic strength the experimental results show that the ionic strength mainly affects the value of the btc s peak with less influence on the btc s tailing a higher ionic strength results in a lower peak and a slightly weaker tailing in the btc the reason is because colloid deposition in porous media is sensitive to the ionic strength molnar et al 2015 gao et al 2004 according to the classical filtration and dlvo theory the increasing ionic strength causes two changes firstly the electrostatic repulsion among colloidal particles decreases and van der waals force increases which cause the colloidal particles prone to converge secondly the interaction between the colloids and the surface of soil is enhanced causing increased sorption of colloids to the soil surface and increasing the proportion of clogging corapcioglu et al 1999 bradford and kim 2010 as a result the deposition rate of mobile colloids would be enhanced as well as the removal rate in yu et al 2013 s experiments the high ionic strength flow was prepared with the kcl solution at a concentration of 100 mm l upon the low ionic strength tap water in general all the parameters in the mechanism based model can be impacted by the increasing ionic strength even though flow remains the same according to the dlvo theory the rate of deposition of colloids on the vegetation and soil grains will be larger with increasing ionic strength the change of concentration gradient causes the change of the colloids exchange rate according to fick s law it is known that different electrolyte types have different effects on the mobility of colloids de jonge et al 2004 grolimund and borkovec 2006 and it is difficult to determine the specific relationship between the ionic strength and the clogging term therefore we assume that the ionic strength mainly affects the value of kp in the p tfade model fig 4 shows that both the p tfade model and yu s model can simulate transport of colloids well yu s model captures the shape of btcs peak better while the p tfade characterizes the btcs tails much better however all the parameters in the yu s model can be impacted by the increasing ionic strength even though the flow rate remains the same yu et al 2013 which increase the model uncertainty the p tfade results show that kp increases with increasing ionic strength for low is kp 0 7 and for high is kp 1 1 resulting in a lower recovery rate other parameters remain constant in this case the sum of the blocked colloid amount increases significantly with the increasing ionic strength fig 5 3 3 effect of flow rate experiments show that a higher flow rate yields a higher recovery rate and a higher peak concentration for colloids fig 6 while causing a weaker btc tail this is because the lower flow rate increases the retention for colloids in the soil and dense vegetation system which promotes the deposition of colloids on the surface of soil grains and stems of vegetation and increases the rate of mass entering the exchange layer compared with yu s model the p tfade model simulated the peak and the late time tail of the btcs more effectively especially the tailing behavior fig 6 when the flow rate increased from 64 ml min to 84 ml min the value of kp increased from 2 2 to 9 0 since the btc tailing behavior might not be significant the parameters λ and α remained stable among the parameters used in the p tfade model table 1 we only needed to change kp for different flow rates while in yu s model almost all the parameters were different under different flowrates table 1 shows that the recovery rate of the high flowrate 84 ml min was 72 7 while the recovery rate of the low flowrate 62 ml min was 62 9 as shown in fig 7 when the flowrate was 84 ml min the total plugging quantity of colloids simulated by the p tfade model was 26 7 when the flowrate was 62 ml min the plugging amount was 7 8 this is consistent with our analysis that a higher water velocity with a stronger shearing force could move away the particles attached on the soil and vegetation resulting in a lower deposition rate 3 4 effect of vegetation type in this study bahia and ryegrass were considered the btc of colloids moving through the bahia soil system had a higher peak value and a heavier tailing behavior in the btc fig 8 the parameters used to simulated the btcs for the ryegrass and bahia grass systems in the p tfade model were as follows for the bahia grass β 1 9 d 0 2 λ 0 0007 α 0 81 and kp 0 7 for ryegrass β 1 9 d 0 2 λ 0 0025 α 0 78 and kp 1 4 it is known that different vegetation types have different grass stem surface characteristics and root systems which can change the residence time distribution of colloids and affect the tailing behavior of btcs captured by λ and α in the model meanwhile the vegetation types also affect the colloid deposition rate on the vegetation surface captured by kp it was expected that the three parameters including λ α and kp were impacted by the vegetation type compared with the p tfade model more parameters in yu s model need to be changed under different grass types table 1 indicates that more colloidal particles were retained in the ryegrass soil system the ryegrass soil system had a lower recovery rate of 68 0 than the bahia soil system with a 70 5 recovery rate in addition the p tfade model showed that the retained colloid amount in the bahia and ryegrass soil systems was 15 8 and 30 0 of the total mass respectively fig 9 4 conclusion colloid contamination from agricultural land can be alleviated by the vegetative filter strips whose efficiency however cannot be conveniently quantified by the standard mechanism based models to provide an efficient evaluation tool a p tfade model based on tempered fractional calculus and plugging process was proposed results showed that compared to yu s model the p tfade model is more suitable for describing the late time tailing behavior of colloids moving in the vfs system with less parameters and it can also well characterize the plugging process of colloids in soil and vegetation various properties in the vfs system can affect colloid dynamics in the experiments and the effects can be efficiently captured by the p tfade model particularly the impact of colloid size on its dynamics can be represented by two parameters in the p tfade model the time fractional order αand the plugging coefficient kp in addition to the uncertain physical chemical effects on the plugging the impact of ionic strength and flow rate on colloid dynamics can be quantified by the plugging coefficient kp the impact of vegetation type on colloid dynamics can be captured by adjusting the three parameters λ α and kp the p tfade can decrease model uncertainty and be conveniently transferred under different conditions making it superior to the standard mechanism based models in quantifying colloid fate and transport in complex soil vegetation systems

1582,colloid contaminants are widely distributed in surface runoff from crop land and can be effectively removed by vegetative filter strips vfs whose quantification however proves difficult standard mechanism based models contain many unknown parameters with intrinsic uncertainty limiting their applicability and potential extension for other environmental conditions and colloid contaminant types to remedy this limitation and capture the complex dynamics of colloids through the soil vegetation system this study proposes a parsimonious particle plugging tempered fractional advection dispersion eq p tfade with a few empirical parameters which is built upon the promising fractional calculus engine the p tfade model extends the promising tempered fractional derivative model by incorporating a plugging term which is then proved to be able to capture both the plugging dynamics and tailing behavior of colloids under various hydrologic and geochemical conditions applications also show that the two critical parameters in the p tfade model the time index α and plugging coefficient kp can efficiently characterize the impact of the flowrate and ionic condition on transport of different sized colloids observed in our laboratory in addition the vegetation type determines the overall structure of the soil vegetation system whose impact on the colloid removal efficiency can be quantified by adding a parameter λ in the physical model therefore the novel p tfade model can reduce the model uncertainty and help us further understand the nature of colloid dynamics through dense vegetation and soil systems keywords colloid transport soil vegetation system tempered fractional model plugging process tailing behavior removal efficiency 1 introduction dense vegetation or vegetative filter strips vfss can reduce colloids contamination in surface runoff from non point source pollution gharabaghi et al 2006 sabbagh et al 2009 yuan et al 2009 arora et al 2010 dousset et al 2010 veum et al 2011 otto et al 2012 olilo et al 2016 yu et al 2019 colloids are particles with at least one dimension smaller than 10 um mobile colloids in the surface runoff have adverse effects on the water quality either directly as contaminants or by facilitating the other highly reactive contaminants like metal or oxidized metal mobile colloids in the hydrological path present a public health risk beck et al 2013 cao 2011 vfss which can be either natural or implanted grass or meadows are widely used to retain the sediment or solute contaminants and it was proved that colloids can be also effectively immobilized either in the soil profile or deposited on the surface of vegetations wu et al 2011 yu et al 2011 yu et al 2012 the key to evaluating a vfs system is to determine the removal efficiency of colloids which can be done by developing quantitative models in addition to laboratory field experiments evaluating this efficiency motivated this study mechanism based models have experienced difficulty when quantifying the mass of colloids remaining in the soil profile and on the surface of dense vegetation in complex physical and chemical environments particularly they have limited adaptability when capturing different late time tailing behaviors of colloid transport under various environmental conditions and or colloid types the soil vegetation system can be conceptualized as a two layer porous medium containing the soil and the vegetation for each layer the flow route and physical transport of colloids within the interconnected soil vegetation system can be complex to effectively model this complex system multiple processes must all be considered including the flow dynamics and colloid exchange between the two layers of the porous medium and the concurrent horizontal flow and colloid transport to capture each of these processes at least one model parameter is needed if the mechanism based models are used when the physical and or chemical environment such as the type of colloid and vegetation the flow rate and or ionic strength changes parameters in the mechanism based model have to be adjusted accordingly yu et al 2013 constraining the model s adaptation capability in addition the mechanism based models have limited predictability considering 1 the large number of model parameters and the associated uncertainty and 2 the intrinsic heterogeneity of vegetation and soil alternative physical models with less empirical parameters are therefore needed to efficiently quantify the distribution of various types of colloids in the soil vegetation system one potential stochastic model to quantify colloids moving through the vfs is the promising fractional derivative equation fde model which was built upon the fractional calculus and applied by hydrologists to capture non fickian or anomalous transport of pollutants in natural aquifers with multi scale heterogeneity zhang et al 2014 wei et al 2016 wei et al 2017 meerschaert et al 2008 the fde replaces the integer order derivative in space time or both in the standard advection dispersion equation ade with a fractional order derivative to describe the memory impact in contaminant transport from different factors for example multiple rate sorption desorption schumer et al 2003 it is a parsimonious upscaling model with a few parameters which can simulate complex transport processes driven by multi scale medium heterogeneity that cannot be exhaustively mapped by standard mechanism based models metzler and klafter 2000 cvetkovic cvetkovic 2011 found that the waiting time distribution of many hydrologic processes can be described by a universal density function the single side tempered stable density whose scaling limit is governed by the time tempered fractional advection dispersion equation tfade meerschaert et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 to the best of our knowledge the fde and tfade have not been applied to model colloid transport through dense vegetation and soil systems this is because the standard fde or tfade needs to be improved before it can efficiently capture the dynamics of both mobile and immobile colloids in the complex vfs system this study aims to fill the knowledge gap mentioned above by developing a novel fde model to capture the plugging process and tailing behavior of colloid transport in the complex vfs system applicability of this model will then be checked against colloid dynamics observed in the laboratory under controlled environmental conditions including colloid size flow rate ionic strength and vegetation type detailed comparison with the tfade and mechanism based models will also be shown to determine the feasibility of the new model and improve our understand of the nature of colloid dynamics in the vfs system 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment description the experimental material setup and procedure can be found in yu et al 2013 here we briefly introduce them the carboxylated polystyrene latex microsphere which is commonly used as surrogates for both abiotic and biotic natural colloids were used in the experiments quartz sand silica has a size varying from 0 5 mm to 0 6 mm bulk density of 1 54 g cm3 and porosity of 0 3 the silica sand was then packed in a soil box with a dimension of 20 3 cm in length 19 1 cm in width and 9 9 cm in depth two turf grasses bahia paspalum notatum and perennial ryegrass lolium perenne l were selected as the experimental grasses because of their differing root and stem systems the average distance between the stems was less than 2 cm and the height of the dense vegetation was 8 cm conservative tracer experiments using bromide were first conducted as a control test to quantify the water distribution in the system colloids experiments with different sizes and physical chemical biological conditions were then conducted the system first did not consider any drainage after the soil was saturated with colloid free water and the flow rate stabilized bromide tracer with colloids were injected into the system continuously for 10 min the injection was then switched to regular colloid free water for 20 min to flush out the mobile colloids and bromide 2 2 stochastic model development the stochastic model should be able to account for the variation of the recovery rate for collides due to the change of the colloid particle size and environmental conditions or in other words the model should capture the breakthrough curves btcs of the colloids especially the peak concentration value and the tailing behavior which is one of the major characteristics of anomalous transport which are affected significantly by the colloid and environmental properties a plugging sink term therefore is added to the tfade model leading to the following particle plugging tempered fractional advection dispersion eq p tfade model c t β e λt α t α e λt c βλ α c d 2 c x 2 v c x s plug where s plug is the plugging sink term which varies with the colloid size and the other physic chemical conditions here c is the colloid concentration d denotes the effective dispersion coefficient v is mean flow rate β is the fractional capacity coefficient which can be approximated by the volume ratio of the vegetation soil system to the underlying flow namely β v soil v water α is the order of the time fractional derivative indicating the delay effect of the vegetation soil system to the colloids and λ is the truncation parameter which defines the time when the colloid s tailing behavior in the btc transfers from the power law distribution to an exponential distribution meerschaert et al 2008 schumer et al 2003 the term s plug in the above p tfade model is added to quantify the overall impact of the detailed medium and colloid properties which sometimes are too detailed to be measured exhaustively on the kinetics of colloids especially the colloid concentration soil porosity η average of colloid particle size dp average of soil particle size ds and other physical chemical effect caused by plant roots and soil system hence the plugging sink term can take the following form s plug kp η in dp ds 1 c where kp is the plugging coefficient which represents the physical chemical effects on colloid plugging such as soil properties ionic condition vegetation type flow rate and the coupling effect of vegetation roots and soil system in addition due to the relatively low concentration of colloids and the short duration of the experiment the variation of soil porosity with time was not considered in this study in the following we will test extensively the feasibility of this formula for s plug it is noteworthy that there is no quantitative correlation between the recovery rate and the plugging amount or in other words plugging only accounts for part of the collides removed from the solution i e 1 recovery rate m plug m total this is because factors e g physic chemical or biological processes gamerdinger and kaplan 2001 bradford et al 2003 rinck pfeiffer et al 2000 corapcioglu et al 1999 which differ from the plugging effect also retain the colloids in the soil vegetation system during the experimental period while some of the colloids continue to flow out of the soil 3 results and discussion in this section we show the experimental results by yu et al 2013 and explore the

and bahia grass systems in the p tfade model were as follows for the bahia grass β 1 9 d 0 2 λ 0 0007 α 0 81 and kp 0 7 for ryegrass β 1 9 d 0 2 λ 0 0025 α 0 78 and kp 1 4 it is known that different vegetation types have different grass stem surface characteristics and root systems which can change the residence time distribution of colloids and affect the tailing behavior of btcs captured by λ and α in the model meanwhile the vegetation types also affect the colloid deposition rate on the vegetation surface captured by kp it was expected that the three parameters including λ α and kp were impacted by the vegetation type compared with the p tfade model more parameters in yu s model need to be changed under different grass types table 1 indicates that more colloidal particles were retained in the ryegrass soil system the ryegrass soil system had a lower recovery rate of 68 0 than the bahia soil system with a 70 5 recovery rate in addition the p tfade model showed that the retained colloid amount in the bahia and ryegrass soil systems was 15 8 and 30 0 of the total mass respectively fig 9 4 conclusion colloid contamination from agricultural land can be alleviated by the vegetative filter strips whose efficiency however cannot be conveniently quantified by the standard mechanism based models to provide an efficient evaluation tool a p tfade model based on tempered fractional calculus and plugging process was proposed results showed that compared to yu s model the p tfade model is more suitable for describing the late time tailing behavior of colloids moving in the vfs system with less parameters and it can also well characterize the plugging process of colloids in soil and vegetation various properties in the vfs system can affect colloid dynamics in the experiments and the effects can be efficiently captured by the p tfade model particularly the impact of colloid size on its dynamics can be represented by two parameters in the p tfade model the time fractional order αand the plugging coefficient kp in addition to the uncertain physical chemical effects on the plugging the impact of ionic strength and flow rate on colloid dynamics can be quantified by the plugging coefficient kp the impact of vegetation type on colloid dynamics can be captured by adjusting the three parameters λ α and kp the p tfade can decrease model uncertainty and be conveniently transferred under different conditions making it superior to the standard mechanism based models in quantifying colloid fate and transport in complex soil vegetation systems

blob morphology before and after surfactant flushing events to assess the primary factors controlling the recovery results showed relatively low 10 net recovery from the homogeneous sand after 5 pore volumes pvs of surfactant flushing and may be in part due to the more connected ganglia i e single continuous oil phase such a condition may have limited the surfactant oil contact resulting in relatively low interfacial activity and correspondingly inefficient oil mobilization and recovery negligible net oil recovery was achieved from the mildly heterogeneous sand and is likely due to the lower associated permeability of this particular porous medium furthermore the oil phase distribution within this medium primarily consisted of small disconnected blobs more readily exposed in contact with the surfactant solution for the highly heterogeneous sand experiments an average of 20 heavy oil recovery resulted after each flushing event total of 37 after 5 pvs and was attributed to more efficient reduction of interfacial tension associated with the increased surfactant oil contact the associated higher ph sand fine carbonate system may have aided in maintaining a water wet porous

risk of release or failure and that pose significant adverse environmental and health consequences for a particular region or population the removal extraction of these heavy crude oil and hydrocarbon

mccray et al 2011 ghosh and tick 2013 akyol et al 2013 tick et al 2015 akyol 2018 most of these studies have focused on the effectiveness of enhanced solubilization removal techniques which can be limited by mass transfer constraints i e dissolution from the napl phase to the aqueous phase however surfactant induced mobilization techniques promote enhanced remediation though the reduction of interfacial tension between the oil i e napl and aqueous phases increasing the mobility of the napl blobs as a pure phase or emulsified phase through a porous medium liu et al 2006 hunky et al 2010 mobility of the displaced napl phase or pools in a porous medium relies on a change in the napl morphology and distribution which eventually can segregate into smaller discontinuous blobs chatzis and morrow 1984 larson et al 1981 melrose and brander 1974 the advantage of surfactant induced mobilization relies on the high potential to remove pure phase product from the subsurface in less time than enhanced solubility techniques which are dependent upon mass transfer constraints i e dissolution to aqueous phase ghosh and tick 2013 the objectives of this research are to understand the primary pore scale trapping mechanisms and changes in oil distribution and morphology affecting heavy crude oil recovery as a function of porous medium heterogeneity during surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation sear techniques sxm imaging was applied to determine the pore scale distribution and recovery processes of san joaquin valley heavy crude oil within unconsolidated sandy media a critical component for interpolating extrapolating and predicting oil napl recovery potential from the subsurface depends upon the ability to quantify pore scale processes and changing oil distribution in situ

carroll et al 2009 the change in individual blob morphology and the critical conditions for breaking down and mobilizing a particular oil blob can be described by the weber number n w walstra 1993 boom 2008 n w describes the ratio of the forces applied by the local fluid velocity density on a given oil blob diameter to the interfacial forces between the phases leal 1992 weber and digiano 1996 larger n w values indicate a greater potential for oil blob deformation and break up into smaller blobs thereby leading to greater mobilization and recovery several pore scale mechanisms are attributed to the high recovery of heavy oil due to reduced interfacial phenomena by surfactant oil interactions these processes include emulsification of oil phase followed by either entrainment or re entrapment of the oil blobs and change in wettability of solid media grain surface johnson 1976 kessel 1989 thomas and ali 1989 grattoni and dawe 2003 tong et al 2003 romero 2009 al rossies et al 2010 sheng 2015 mcauliffe 1973 discussed the fundamental concepts of oil water emulsion blob trapping and mobilization processes at the macroscopic scale during hydrodynamic displacement of oil blobs fingering processes can be observed in heterogeneous porous media the oil water emulsion will initially flow primarily through preferential flow paths i e high permeability zones but eventually result in the temporary restriction of oil phase mobility complete blockage of a pore throat can occur causing the flow to follow new paths this effect can initiate the water or flushing solution to flow through the unswept zones i e lower permeability in greater proportion resulting in greater overall sweep efficiencies thomas and ali 1989 engelke et al 2012 zhao et al 2013 2 2 wettability changes and mobility wetting behavior can change with composition of oil fraction and ph of the system morrow 1990 buckley et al 1996 kaminsky and radke 1997 hui and blunt 2000 sheng 2015 under such conditions a porous medium is expected to exist under oil wet conditions for ph 7 acidic and water wet conditions above ph 7 alkaline for heavy crude oil fractions dubey and doe 1993 hirasaki and zhang 2004 bryan and kantzas 2009 booth 2018 an originally oil wet medium can be preferentially changed to a water wet system yielding higher oil recoveries by altering the ph and or salinity through the application of a chemical flushing agent booth 2018 in contrast under certain flushing conditions an originally water wet medium can change to an oil wet condition and the trapped disconnected oil phase may redistribute into a continuous phase either limiting or enhancing recovery potential johnson 1976 schramm 2000 the sorting and distribution of grains can also influence the wettability water wet vs oil wet of heterogeneous porous media and thereby influence the oil recovery potential of a specific system carrigy 1962 hirasaki 1991 dubey and doe 1993 schramm 2000 hirasaki and zhang 2004

the quantitative characterization of the oil phase was carried out by separating phases out from the system i e ex situ these studies focused on quantifying oil morphology and distribution after a single time period of multiphase flow rather than evaluating changes in flow or oil distribution temporally more recently emerging technologies such as computer assisted x ray tomography cat and

3 materials and methods the representative heavy fraction crude oil used for the experiments was san joaquin valley sjv crude chevron richmond ca having an api gravity 14 to improve the image contrast

60 g l 1 cesium chloride cscl 99 99 optical grade from acros organics nj for the same purpose previous research has shown that insignificant change in interfacial tension resulted from the addition of cscl dopant to the aqueous phase and negligible partitioning to the oil phase schnaar and brusseau 2006a 2006b ghosh and tick 2013 however minor changes in interfacial tension for the bulk heavy oil occurred due to the addition of iodobenzene ib dopant the addition of approximately 10 vol ib density 1 82 g cm 3 also increased the specific gravity of the heavy crude oil from 14 to 4 2 api and

branched alcohol propoxy sulfate commercially known as petrostep s 1 stepan chemical company northfield il was chosen for its ability to develop low interfacial tension at low concentrations the experiments herein relied on the principal mechanism of surfactant induced mobilization rather than solubilization for the removal and remediation of crude oil napl under low surfactant concentration conditions e g ghosh and tick 2013 booth 2018 this surfactant was developed specifically for enhanced oil recovery eor and surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation sear applications this surfactant was also shown to experience minimal adsorption to the solid phase goddard et al 2004 and high salinity tolerance wu et al 2005 it should be noted that the time interval between surfactant flushing and image capture was 4 h limiting the extent of surfactant adsorption on silica sand and mixtures of silica sand calcareous grains as observed by preliminary tests ghosh 2011 preliminary tests were carried out to ensure that the concentration of the surfactant solution was below the critical micelle concentration cmc 0 9 while simultaneously optimizing the reduction of interfacial tension between the oil and surfactant solution ensuring that mobilization was the dominant mechanism of oil removal ghosh 2011 ghosh and tick 2013 booth 2018 the aqueous cscl flushing solution 60 g l 1 used to create the initial heavy oil residual saturations was determined to have a dynamic viscosity of 0 84 cp 0 0084 dyn s cm 2 table 1 ghosh and tick 2013 the cscl doped surfactant flushing solution was measured to have a dynamic viscosity of 2 21 cp 0 022 dyn s cm 2 ghosh and tick 2013 table 1 interfacial surface tensions tensions σow were measured using a du noüy ring tensiometer fisher instruments model 20 and determined to be 42 3 dyn cm 1 for the oil cscl system i e aqueous residual pre surfactant flush and 24 7 dyn cm 1 for the oil surfactant system i e sear flush this reflects an approximately 42 decrease in interfacial surface tension due to the presence of the surfactant solution three types of unconsolidated sands with increasing physical heterogeneity were used as representative porous media table 2 the particle heterogeneity of the porous media was characterized in terms of uniformity coefficient c u d 60 d 10 the porous media are commercially available unimin corporation ottawa mn and included homogeneous 40 50 accusand with a uniformity coefficient c u equal to 1 mildly heterogeneous accusand c u 5 8 and highly heterogeneous accusand c u 10 6 the latter two heterogeneous porous media types were prepared in the laboratory and added with specific fractions of fine grained silica sands and calcareous soil to achieve particular uniformity coefficients of interest the homogeneous h sand mildly heterogeneous mh sand and highly heterogeneous hh sand sands were characterized by porosities n of 33 27 and 25 mean particle diameters d 50 of 0 35 0 27 and 0

media i e 40 50 mesh and natural calcareous soil were used in these experiments the calcareous soil is characterized as a poorly sorted sandy loam the soil has an alkaline character with a ph of 8 4

silica sand materials is very low o c 0 05 properties of the silica sand media are reported in ghosh and tick 2013 the calcareous soil was also used in other studies to create similar physical heterogeneity for investigating the remediation of dnapl using cyclodextrin surfactant and surfactant enhanced permanganate oxidation reagent scenarios akyol 2018 akyol and turkkan 2018 due to the fact that the calcareous soil natural soil has been well characterized in terms of physical and chemical properties it was selected for addition within silica sand distributions as mixtures to create targeted physical heterogeneity variations in addition the creation of physically heterogeneous porous media using this mixture of calcareous soil and silica sand provide valuable comparison to other studies that used the same and or similar media configurations and can also potentially be compared to other more real world systems with more complex physical chemical distributions akyol 2018 akyol and turkkan 2018 a homogenized mixture of these sands were packed into the columns as a single porous medium in the approximate weight fraction ratios for the mildly heterogeneous 25 calcareous soil 75 40 50 mesh silica sands and highly heterogeneous 50 calcareous soil 50 40 50 mesh silica sands media to compare heavy crude oil recovery as a function of particle heterogeneity and mineralogy i e presence of calcium carbonate of the medium the physical heterogeneity effects of calcareous soil versus silica sand on napl recovery have also been identified in other studies akyol and turkkan 2018 akyol 2018 separate thin walled anodized aluminum columns were dry packed with the three different types of porous media these packed columns were 4 4 cm long with an inner diameter i d of 0 5 cm and consisted of end fittings on the top and bottom ghosh and tick 2013 the sample representative elementary volumes rev for all of these packed systems were achieved to include the scale of all heterogeneities i e porosity and permeability within the column volumes see ghosh and tick 2013 rev is the smallest volume over which a measurement can be made that will yield a value representative

heavy oil distribution before initial residual saturation and after each subsequent surfactant flushing event a comprehensive description of the experimental procedures is provided by ghosh and tick 2013 three dimensional imaging techniques have received increasing attention over the last decade and have been used extensively in understanding the pore scale distribution of immiscible liquids nonaqueous phase liquids napl sxm imaging can resolve image resolutions ranging from 1 to 10 μm and even smaller sizes of higher resolution under specific conditions and this technique is capable of imaging multiple phases simultaneously by changing the incident energy level of the photon source x ray beam however this technique can only be used to study relatively small systems up to a few centimeters in thickness previous studies show that sxm imaging has been used successfully to observe and statistically analyze porosity and residual saturation coles et al 1998 pore structure

properties associated with the heavy oil flushing experiments such as changes in the interfacial tension and trapping parameters associated with pre and post surfactant flushing compared to the initial residual saturation heavy oil water system the effect of the surfactant resulted in a 42 reduction of interfacial tension between heavy oil and 0 1 surfactant solution from 42 3 dyn cm 1 to 24 7 dyn cm 1 a corresponding increase 350 in capillary number n c resulted due to surfactant flushing for all three porous media n c was linearly correlated with porous media permeability k for both residual saturation and post flushing conditions with a slope 4 6 greater 4 5 magnitude increase for post flushing conditions although the capillary numbers increased by an order of magnitude values were within the ranges expected for well bore flushing systems using similar alkaline type surfactants cuthiell et al 1995 n c increases were primarily associated with the effect from decreased interfacial tension and therefore remained essentially constant for all three of the porous media systems the bond numbers n b varied between 10 8 and 10 6 depending on the porous medium the n b was linearly correlated with porous media permeability k for both residual saturation and post flushing conditions with a slope 2 greater 2 0 magnitude increase for post flushing conditions the introduction of surfactant flushing had relatively small influence on the post flushing n b 88 increase this suggests that at least during surfactant flushing the buoyancy gravitational component had little effect on oil mobilization processes for range of porous media however when comparing the magnitude of the initial residual n c and n b values i e n b 10 greater than n c for the h sand homogeneous system buoyancy gravitational effects may impose greater control on initial oil mobilization distribution than viscous forces for residual saturation establishment the range of trapping number n t values 3 10 7 2 10 6 was below the threshold values required to initiate immiscible liquid i e napl phase mobilization pennell et al 1996 table 3 increases in n t varied by factors of 2 5 4 0 150 300 as a result of surfactant flushing with values ranging between 1 10 6 and 4 10 6 table 3 for the different porous media systems n t was linearly correlated with porous media permeability k for both residual saturation and post flushing conditions with a slope 2 greater 2 0 magnitude increase for post flushing conditions based on the previously reported threshold values for initial mobilization the surfactant flood would not tend to produce any mobilization of the heavy oil under these conditions however such reported threshold values have only been reported for very specific fluid porous medium systems and may not represent or describe specific conditions for complex multicomponent heavy oil systems whereby physicochemical and porous medium properties are significantly different ghosh and tick 2013 values of weber number n w for residual saturation and post surfactant flushing are presented in table 3 values were determined using the mean oil blob size diameter for the resulting distributions before residual saturation and after sequential surfactant flushing events n w could not be calculated for the oil within the h sand as the distribution remained as a single large ganglion with insignificant changes in morphology during surfactant flushing for the mh and hh sand oil systems surfactant flushing resulted in about a 3 5 fold increase 250 for n w values there was no clear trend for oil bob disintegration break up as a function of weber number due to surfactant flushing 4 2 distribution of heavy oil napl blobs in 2 d and 3 d sections fig 1 a b c shows the distribution of the heavy crude oil in the homogeneous h sand the mildly heterogeneous mh sand and the highly heterogeneous hh sand sands for representative 2 d cross sections along the x z vertical section direction all quantitative results i e recovery morphology surface area volumes etc exclude any oil accumulation along the margins and only represent the interior conditions of the column porous medium matrix only the initial residual oil saturation conditions pre surfactant flood and the resulting oil distribution after subsequent surfactant flushing episodes are presented in fig 1 these images show the oil phase as light white regions and solid media as dark gray to black a relatively high volume of heavy oil present as an initial continuous phase within the h sand system can be observed fig 1a quantitative measurements using post processing blob3d software ketcham 2005 resulted in an initial oil volume and saturation s n within this h sand column system of 34 mm3 and 37 5 respectively table 4 although no major changes occurred in oil phase distribution during the initial episodes of surfactant flushing some mobilization processes were observed due to the preferential flow on the lower half section of the column after the 5 pvs of flushing heavy oil recovery primarily occurred through preferential flow paths along higher permeability zones within the homogeneous medium this observation supports the previous description and basis of enhanced recovery via mobilization processes moreover under such conditions and the short time scale of these experiments oil removal via dissolution processes rate limited would be negligible and further supports the basis that recovery of crude oil occurred dominantly as raw pure phase wettability is also controlled by the interfacial tension between two or more phases a wetting phase i e aqueous solution or water has a tendency to be trapped into the smaller pore spaces of the porous media whereas the relatively more nonwetting phase oil in this case should preferentially occupy the larger pore spaces mercer and cohen 1990 as described the oil phase will tend to be trapped into the larger pores therefore under the premise of the local pore doublet model the trapped oil will preferentially be distributed in 50 of the available large pore spaces in homogeneous porous media ghosh 2011 the other two heterogeneous porous media systems mh sand and hh sand showed a discontinuous oil phase distribution under the initial saturation conditions fig 1b c the heavy oil in the mh sand system exhibited a relatively heterogeneous initial blob distribution with some larger blobs existing at the top and the bottom portions of the column quantitative measurements resulted in an initial oil volume and saturation s n of 3 8 mm3 and 5 1 respectively table 4 during the surfactant flushing events the larger oil blobs were preferentially removed and or redistributed as smaller blobs within the system as displayed by the changes in morphology and volume over flushing time the initial saturation of oil within the hh sand system was also characterized by a heterogeneous distribution of small and large blobs as observed in the 2 d images fig 1c quantitative measurements resulted in an initial oil volume and saturation s n of 1 9 mm3 and 2 8 respectively table 4 notable changes in oil blob morphology and distribution were observed after subsequent flushing events the number of larger blobs preferentially decreased mobilized and or redistributed whereby the pores were gradually dominated by smaller blobs after each flushing episode resulting in minimum oil saturation after 5 pvs of surfactant flushing fig 2 a b c shows the 3 d distributions of the oil blobs within consistently cropped sections 1 5 1 5 4 mm of each column for initial saturation conditions and after subsequent surfactant flushing episodes as noted previously a high initial saturation of oil within the h sand system was generally distributed as a continuous interconnected oil phase through multiple pore networks no significant changes in oil distribution occurred after all surfactant flushing events as observed in the 3 d imaged sections indicating that heavy oil mobilization occurred only through preferential flow during residual saturation establishment the nonwetting fluid heavy oil napl phase will preferentially invade the larger pore spaces due to the reduced capillary pressure required to displace the initial water from these pores thus the wetting fluid aqueous solution will be typically present within the smaller pores size distribution gradually the aqueous phase initially residing in the larger pores will be displaced by the oil phase generally leaving the smallest pores to be filled by aqueous phase solution water phase mercer and cohen 1990 ghosh 2011 in contrast to the oil distribution within the h sand system a relatively uniform distribution of discontinuous oil blobs was present as initial saturation within the other two heterogeneous media systems i e mh sand and hh sand fig 2b c the porous media characteristics i e fraction of fine particles and non uniform particle size distribution were likely primary factors contributing to the initial small discrete oil blob distribution after each successive surfactant flushing event the initial oil blobs were broken down into even smaller blobs and eventually removed or redistributed as they were mobilized from the system this is a common phenomenon found in heterogeneous porous media with significant contrasts in permeabilities mcauliffe 1973 engelke et al 2012 zhao et al 2013 interestingly a local increase of saturation occurred after the first of two surfactant flushing events 2 pv and 3 pv 5 pvs total this increase of local saturation may be due to the initial mobilization redistribution and subsequent trapping of oil blobs within the smaller pore diameters throats of the mh sand system into the scanned section of the column in addition trapped oil phase within the end caps of the column could have mobilized into the scanned portion of the column during the subsequent surfactant flushing events in any event this initial oil mobilization and trapping clogging within the larger pore networks may have led to an increase in sweep efficiency and oil recovery as the flushing fluid would be forced through lower permeability zones larger swept zone although advantageous this process can delay the recovery process and greater recovery may only occur after flushing with many pore volumes of solution for the hh sand system the initial oil distribution was highly heterogeneous exhibiting large and small blobs with smaller sized blobs dominant in number similar to the mh sand system progressively smaller sized oil blobs were observed after subsequent surfactant flushing episodes the resulting disintegration of the oil distribution into smaller blobs is likely due to effects of reduced oil solution interfacial tension associated with the surfactant booth 2018 however this system also showed the accumulation of some larger blobs after 5 pvs of surfactant flushing and this may be in part due to the coalescence redistribution of some smaller blobs during mobilization of all three porous medium systems oil recovery was most pronounced within the hh sand system after 5 pvs of surfactant flushing and the remaining oil distribution within the column was dominated by smaller sized blobs fig 2c these observations were confirmed by both 2 d and 3 d images of the oil distribution fig 1c as well as quantitative results discussed in the following section 4 3 heavy oil napl recovery quantitative results for heavy oil recovery from the three porous media based on 3 d image data are presented in table 4 recoveries quantified for the entire scanned columns neglecting cropped section along central part of the column were in good agreement with the observed results from the representative cropped 2 d and 3 d image sections for the h sand system a net gain of 4 7 heavy oil occurred after the first 2 pv surfactant flood indicating that oil phase was remobilized into the scanned column region during this flushing step after the second surfactant flushing event 3 pv 5 pv total a 10 1 net oil recovery resulted with respect to maximum volume i e after 2 pvs moreover the total surface area of the entire oil phase distribution increased by 7 2 after the 2 pv flood but decreased slightly by 1 4 after 5 pvs of surfactant flushing with respect to the previous 2 pv condition table 5 clearly the surfactant application and resulting oil water interfacial reduction was insufficient to induce significant oil recovery in this case the relatively high permeability of the medium resulted in the formation of a continuous heavy oil phase through an initially water wet porous medium system since the hydrodynamic gradient is imposed over the entire length of the continuous oil distribution a greater n c critical capillary number may have been required for mobilization of the continuous phase larger ganglion wardlaw and mckellar 1985 proposed that a critical capillary number ccn has to be achieved for mobilization of the blobs and that any capillary number less than the critical number can result in blob separation and redistribution within the pore spaces wettability is another factor that can control the oil trapping mechanism in such systems the 2 d vertical imaged column section of the oil water distribution i e initial residual saturation showed a discontinuous aqueous phase in the presence of a relatively continuous oil phase prior to oil imbibition the homogeneous sand system was saturated with water electrolyte solution thereby establishing initially water wet conditions during crude oil injection imbibition as the oil phase displaced the water phase the system may have been altered into an oil wet condition for example san joaquin valley sjv heavy crude oil has been noted to exhibit oil wetting behavior to silica sand at a ph 7 schramm 2000 dubey and doe 1993 burden 2012 reported that sjv heavy crude oil contained 8 9 by weight asphaltenes previous research has shown that heavy crude oil systems comprising high asphaltene content under low ph condition i e ph 4 tend to exhibit oil wetting conditions within silica sands resulting in greater trapping and immobilization of the oil phase buckley et al 1996 booth 2018 showed in heavy crude oil same oil used in the study herein contact angle laboratory experiments kruss gmbh drop shape analyzer dsa 1 hamburg germany with silica media borosilicate plates systems that increasingly water wet conditions resulted as ph increased over a specific range ph 4 13 the ph measured for the cscl solution was 5 6 under laboratory temperature i e 20 c establishing residual saturation of heavy oil through aqueous flushing brine solution i e cscl water proved to be challenging and may be due to development of an oil wet system at this ph condition moreover the surfactant application may have helped maintain an oil wet condition the ph measurement for the anionic surfactant in contact with 40 50 silica sand was approximately 3 6 all sxm images were taken within 24 h of surfactant application and the system ph stabilized at 3 94 after 24 h since there was no measurable oil recovery after 2 pvs of surfactant flushing and approximately only 10 recovery after 5 pvs of flushing it can be concluded that the critical capillary number may have been achieved at some point during the second 3 pv between 2 and 5 pvs surfactant flood resulting in some recovery for the mh sand system a net gain of 10 5 heavy oil by volume occurred after the first 2 pv surfactant flood indicating that oil phase was remobilized into the scanned column region during this flushing step after the second surfactant flushing event 3 pv 5 pv total a 6 5 net oil recovery resulted with respect to maximum volume i e after 2 pvs table 4 moreover the total surface area of the entire oil phase distribution increased by 11 3 after the 2 pv flood and by 3 9 after 5 pvs of surfactant flushing with respect to the previous 2 pv condition table 5 under this condition it may be that the reduced oil solution interfacial tension from the surfactant may have initiated break up disintegration of the oil blobs since the water phase was the continuous phase in this case it is expected that surfactant contact with the oil phase would be maximized thereby aiding in the break up mobilization of the oil blobs however the data reveal that a relatively low net recovery resulted even after 5 pvs of flushing i e 7 vol with respect to the previous 2 pv condition the ph for this system measured 8 25 during the surfactant flood and stabilized at 8 13 after 24 h this higher ph is attributed to the buffering capacity associated with the fine carbonate fraction of the porous medium and may be in part responsible for maintaining a water wet condition whereby smaller blobs are generated during the flushing process for the hh sand system an increasing trend of heavy oil recovery occurred after each surfactant flushing episode 2 pv and 3 pv total of 5 pvs table 4 a total of 37 with respect to initial oil saturation heavy oil recovery was achieved after 5 pvs of surfactant flushing similar to the previous description for the mh sand surfactant flushing experiments it may be that the reduced oil solution interfacial tension from the surfactant may have initiated break up disintegration of the oil blobs however it should be noted that the total initial trapped oil volume in this system was relatively low compared to the more homogeneous sand systems although progressively smaller blobs resulted after each surfactant flushing event the total surface area decreased continuously indicating that oil removal was relatively efficient and that the displacement process generally occurred over the entire length of the system throughout the flushing process i e continuous recovery behavior the two heterogeneous porous media mh and hh sand showed discontinuous oil phase distributions present for the initial residual saturation conditions the heavy oil in the mildly heterogeneous medium mh sand experiment exhibited a relatively heterogeneous blob distribution with larger blobs predominantly existing at the top and the bottom portions of the column oil recovery processes affected the larger distribution of oil blobs initially as the time series images revealed the preferential disappearance of the larger blobs from the system residual oil saturation within the highly heterogeneous porous medium hh sand was also characterized by a highly heterogeneous distribution of large and small oil blobs in 2 d image section in contrast to the other more homogeneous sand systems h and mh sands this system may not have experienced such dramatic preferential flow impacts whereby progressively smaller oil particles were able to flush through the system without becoming significantly clogged or trapped the relatively high ph measured for this system was stable at 8 31 and is attributed to the high buffering capacity associated with the fine carbonate fraction within the porous medium system and may be in part responsible for maintaining a water wet condition under such conditions it is expected that the smaller blobs generated during the flushing process may have also contributed to the significantly greater oil recovery in contrast to the mh sand system whereby much lower oil recovery occurred potentially due to less significant water wetting conditions and or related oil clogging and or oil blob coalescence effects 4 4 heavy oil napl blob distribution quantitative results for heavy oil distribution from the three porous media based on 3 d image data are presented in table 5 changes in crude oil blob distribution and morphology in a particular porous medium can impact oil recovery during surfactant flushing the sxm based imaging techniques make it possible to quantify oil blob volume surface area and specific surface area for each individual blob during the flushing process i e before and after additionally coefficients of variation and uniformity can be determined for the entire oil blob distribution pre or post surfactant flushing indicating general blob morphology changes during removal processes results showed that significant change in blob morphology of heavy crude oil resulted due to the surfactant application process however the heavy oil distribution trapped in the two heterogeneous media mh and hh sand show no significant change in oil blob morphology or shape over the sequential flushing episodes the larger blobs distributed within both of these heterogeneous media systems exhibited elongated and tabular surface areas which were easily differentiated from the oil distributions within the homogeneous media characterization of the oil blob distribution provides important information about the stability of blob morphologies and mobilization processes within a porous medium of known porosity and permeability although few in number the larger blobs generally represent the largest fraction of the oil distribution by volume fig 3a conventionally this type of distribution is characterized and compared by log normal cumulative distribution plots the generated plots figs 3 5 compare the oil blob specific surface area as a function of oil blob volume within a particular medium where the dark bold line represents the model curve representing the blob distribution as perfect spheres minimum surface area condition for all respective equivalent blob volumes any deviation along a vertical line from that model curve represents larger surface area consistent with more complex non spherical blob morphology these types of plots are most useful for characterizing disconnected oil blob distributions the oil distribution within the h sand system predominantly remained as a large continuous interconnected ganglion over the duration of the multiple surfactant flushing events although there was a total oil recovery of up to 10 negligible changes of oil ganglion morphology resulted during the surfactant flushing process therefore a log normal cumulative distribution plot is of limited value fig 3a b however the results from this system can provide important information regarding the type of oil distribution single interconnected mass that might be expected for heavy oil fractions within homogeneous uniform type porous media systems the cumulative distribution of the oil blobs in the mh sand system was characterized by a relatively heterogeneous distribution under the initial saturation condition fig 4a b this trend remained nearly the same after each of the surfactant flushing episodes the blob volumes ranged from 10 5 to 10 1 mm3 after each of the three surfactant flushing episodes for all flushing episodes the mean and median blob sizes varied on the order of 1 49 10 4 mm3 and 6 6 10 5 mm3 respectively table 5 detailed observation of the distribution pattern revealed insignificant changes in blob size after 2 pvs of flushing and the larger blobs increased slightly in volume likely as a result of coalescence or redistribution through oil mobilization processes over the duration of 5 pvs of surfactant flushing the oil blobs became smaller consistent with the previous observations the uniformity coefficient c u and coefficient of variation c v were used to compare the heterogeneity of the oil blob size distribution c v varied from 6 to 6 4 and c u varied from 3 5 to 3 9 for initial saturation condition and after total flushing duration 5 pvs respectively table 5 these values reveal the mild heterogeneity nature of the oil blob distribution and that minimal changes in the blob morphology occurred as a result of the various surfactant flushing events the larger oil blobs exhibited maximum deviations from a spherical shape for instance all blob volumes 10 4 mm3 mean volume pre and or post surfactant flushing deviated significantly from a spherical shape the quantitative data also showed that there was no significant change in the total oil blob surface area pre and or post surfactant flushing for this particular system mh sand the sxm imaged sections confirmed that new blobs were formed i e coalesced or redistributed resulting in increasing total oil blob surface area within the system during surfactant flushing likely due to reduced interfacial tension interactions between the oil and flushing phases the recovery processes described herein were likely primarily controlled by the permeability of the porous medium the relatively low oil recovery observed from the mh sand system over the duration of 5 pvs of surfactant flushing may be the result of oil clogging and or oil blob coalescence effects such impacts may also be in part related to wettability effects the relatively lower carbonate fraction in comparison to the hh sand system may not have induced as much of a water wet condition thereby resulting in relatively lower oil recovery booth 2018 conducted the drop shape analysis to understand the chemical reaction of crude oil in an alkaline solution to examine the wettability effects measurements of contact angle θ and ift show significant change in the wettability of the system as a function of ph even for slight changes in ph in general as ph increased over ranges ph 4 13 resulting decreases in contact angle between the oil phase and borosilicate plate occurred yielding increasingly water wet conditions i e aqueous phase as the wetting agent as opposed to larger contact angles resulting in preferential oil wet conditions i e oil as the wetting agent additionally the reduction of interfacial tension ift between the oil napl and aqueous phases resulted as ph increased it is expected that the dissolution of carbonate minerals from infiltrating rain water carbonic acid in subsurface systems would impact solution ph and thereby change system fluid media contact angles and ift persistent low ph conditions infiltrating rain water could transition a system to be more oil wet whereas dissolution of carbonate rich minerals would tend to increase ph conditions transitioning the system to become more water wet values for contact angle and ift were used to calculate changes in capillary pressure allowing for the determination of pressure thresholds required for napl mobilization to occur in saturated porous media the oil blob distribution within the hh sand system was characterized by a progressive decrease in blob volume after each successive surfactant flushing episode fig 5a b oil blob size varied significantly 10 5 to 10 2 mm3 for the initial saturation condition representing a relatively heterogeneous initial oil distribution the maximum oil blob volume present i e initial saturation was an order of magnitude smaller than the largest oil blob present within the mh sand system the initial mean oil blob volume of 9 2 10 5 mm3 decreased to 6 6 10 5 mm3 30 reduction after a total of 5 pvs of surfactant flushing fig 5a a 14 reduction of median oil blob volume 2 9 10 5 to 2 5 10 5 mm3 was quantified for this same flushing period the oil blob distribution became progressively more homogeneous after each sequential surfactant flushing event over 5 total pvs of surfactant flushing oil blob distribution c u and c v decreased from 2 7 to 2 4 and from 12 6 to 3 7 respectively table 5 changes in the oil blob morphology were generally consistent becoming smaller as oil blob volume decreased after each successive surfactant flushing episode fig 5b a good correlation was determined between the total relative blob surface area and oil recovery after surfactant flushing fig 6 no particular trend was established between surface area and recovery for the more homogenous porous media systems h and mh indicating that removal process within the highly heterogeneous sand i e sand and carbonate fine fraction system was significantly different to that of the more homogenous porous media systems this may indicate that ph and related wettability changes may have a significant control on the removal processes in these more carbonate alkaline sand systems 5 summary and conclusions a pore scale study was conducted to understand the in situ trapping and mobilization processes controlling the removal recovery of a heavy fraction crude oil napl during progressive stages of surfactant flushing for various unconsolidated sands of increasing heterogeneity non uniformity temporal changes of oil distribution and oil blob morphology were quantified in terms of oil mobilization and recovery under the conditions of these experiments heavy fraction crude oil trapped within physically uniform homogeneous porous media may present challenges for removal as the viscous forces needed to overcome the interfacial forces over the entire trapped ganglia domain may be too great to initiate effective mobilization in this case whereby specific surface area of the oil distribution was relatively low the role of this interfacial parameter and oil geometry was likely an important factor limiting surfactant hydraulic accessibility and thus mobilization of the heavy oil for this sand h sand system the hydraulic accessibility contact of surfactant solution i e discontinuous aqueous phase with the oil phase was likely limited sweep efficiency thus this phenomenon reduced interfacial activity and consequently resulted in less oil recovery for this particular system the observed limited recovery in this system h sand may also be associated with changes of wettability from water wet to oil wet conditions for low buffering capacity i e quartz rich reservoirs systems in addition sorption of surfactant was also negligible to the silica sand and silica sand calcareous soil mixture goddard et al 2004 ghosh 2011 booth 2018 the results demonstrate that potential alteration from water wet to oil wet conditions may be a critical factor limiting the mobilization of crude oil in the homogeneous porous medium system indicating that media surface chemistry effects can significantly control removal processes even when pore size distribution is relatively large and uniform porous media sorting and permeability are also significant factors controlling discontinuous oil blob trapping and distribution the porous media systems with higher overall heterogeneity and smaller mean permeability distribution were observed to preferentially result in discontinuous oil distributions during oil phase displacement and formation of residual oil saturation the oil distribution within more physically heterogeneous porous media systems was stable after surfactant flushing as observed by the formation or redistribution of smaller blobs through the reduction of oil water interfacial tension in the mh sand system delayed oil recovery i e 5 pv flushing was observed whereby local oil saturation is primarily restricted by smaller pore diameters until a point at which reduction of oil solution interfacial tension initiates blob disintegration and eventual mobilization recovery for such heterogeneous systems greater oil recovery may be expected at later stages of surfactant flushing due to the formation of smaller blobs whereby hydraulic accessibility of surfactant increases throughout low permeability zones resulting in improved sweep efficiencies as oil blobs in an emulsion mobilize they tend to be captured in relatively smaller pore throats consequently the aqueous phase is forced to flow to the less permeable zones producing greater sweep efficiency this phenomenon was also observed in other studies thomas and ali 1989 hunky et al 2010 romero 2009 bryan and kantzas 2009 liu et al 2006 booth 2018 physically heterogeneous porous media systems or reservoirs with relatively high carbonate fine fraction content and high buffering capacities i e hh sand may be more amenable to sustained oil recovery due to more significant wettability alterations during oil phase displacement and formation of residual oil saturation under the conditions of these experiments hh sand the oil distribution was increasingly stable whereby oil blobs progressively decreased in sized break up resulting in steady oil recovery of approximately 20 after each subsequent surfactant flushing event this was observed by the formation or redistribution of progressively greater number of smaller and more uniform blob distribution after each surfactant flushing episode likely the result of more efficient reduction of interfacial tension associated with the increased surfactant oil contact as better sweep efficiency the associated higher ph sand fine carbonate system may have aided in maintaining a water wet porous medium a condition more conducive to higher oil recovery and displacement efficiency the overall results of this research demonstrate that high resolution in situ characterization i e sxm imaging techniques of changing oil distributions during surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation sear applications can be used to reveal the primary pore scale processes responsible for heavy oil fraction mobilization and recovery in various porous media systems some replication experiments when feasible showed that there was minimal variation of the organic liquid oil surface areas and volumes for initial saturations and resulting oil distributions after surfactant flushing this indicates that the laboratory methods and sxm processing techniques used in this study were robust additionally this research demonstrates that such sxm imaging and fluid phase quantification techniques may be useful for interpreting oil trapping mobilization and related recovery due to wettability shifts induced by changes in porous medium solution ph during enhanced flushing these factors are critical when evaluating the conditions such as oil blob size distribution and blob morphologies most favorable for enhanced recovery from a particular oil contaminated porous medium system these results could provide an improved general basis and guide to assess interpolate and or extrapolate recovery potential for the porous media containing heavy oil fractions similar in nature and therefore aid in predicting specific oil contaminated systems most amenable for surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation sear in addition the processes based on microscopic images of emulsified blobs were prepared externally and injected into the porous media the unique and innovative research as part of this detailed study was used to conduct an in situ three dimensional 3 d pore scale investigation of heavy oil recovery and blob distribution within some typical reservoir porous medium types in order to understand the interfacial processes due to surfactant application for enhanced specifically heavy oil oil recovery seor understanding the effects of surfactant flushing for heavy crude oil fractions should also be taken into account to provide better site characterization and more efficient site remediation as a result the performance of this technology depends on the site specific characteristics i e medium heterogeneity mineralogy and surface chemistry that are critical for the development of proper site characterization accurate risk

1583,the presence of nonaqueous phase liquid napl in the subsurface presents significant challenges for soil and groundwater remediation in particular heavy crude oil coal tar and or bitumen present

blob morphology before and after surfactant flushing events to assess the primary factors controlling the recovery results showed relatively low 10 net recovery from the homogeneous sand after 5 pore volumes pvs of surfactant flushing and may be in part due to the more connected ganglia i e single continuous oil phase such a condition may have limited the surfactant oil contact resulting in relatively low interfacial activity and correspondingly inefficient oil mobilization and recovery negligible net oil recovery was achieved from the mildly heterogeneous sand and is likely due to the lower associated permeability of this particular porous medium furthermore the oil phase distribution within this medium primarily consisted of small disconnected blobs more readily exposed in contact with the surfactant solution for the highly heterogeneous sand experiments an average of 20 heavy oil recovery resulted after each flushing event total of 37 after 5 pvs and was attributed to more efficient reduction of interfacial tension associated with the increased surfactant oil contact the associated higher ph sand fine carbonate system may have aided in maintaining a water wet porous

limited by mass transfer constraints i e dissolution from the napl phase to the aqueous phase however surfactant induced mobilization techniques promote enhanced remediation though the reduction of interfacial tension between the oil i e napl and aqueous phases increasing the mobility of the napl blobs as a pure phase or emulsified phase through a porous medium liu et al 2006 hunky et al 2010 mobility of the displaced napl phase or pools in a porous medium relies on a change in the napl morphology and distribution which eventually can segregate into smaller discontinuous blobs chatzis and morrow 1984 larson et al 1981 melrose and brander 1974 the advantage of surfactant induced mobilization relies on the high potential to remove pure phase product from the subsurface in less time than enhanced solubility techniques which are dependent upon mass transfer constraints i e dissolution to aqueous phase ghosh and tick 2013 the objectives of this research are to understand the primary

remediation sear techniques sxm imaging was applied to determine the pore scale distribution and recovery processes of san joaquin valley heavy crude oil within unconsolidated sandy media a critical component for interpolating extrapolating and predicting oil napl recovery potential from the subsurface depends upon the ability to quantify pore scale processes and changing oil distribution in situ

boom 2008 n w describes the ratio of the forces applied by the local fluid velocity density on a given oil blob diameter to the interfacial forces between the phases leal 1992 weber and digiano 1996 larger n w values indicate a greater potential for oil blob deformation and break up into smaller blobs thereby leading to greater mobilization and recovery several pore scale mechanisms are attributed to the high recovery of heavy oil due to reduced interfacial phenomena by surfactant oil interactions these processes include emulsification of oil phase followed by either entrainment or re entrapment of the oil blobs and change in wettability of solid media grain surface johnson 1976 kessel 1989 thomas and ali 1989 grattoni and dawe 2003 tong et al 2003 romero 2009 al rossies et al 2010 sheng 2015 mcauliffe 1973 discussed the fundamental concepts of oil water emulsion blob trapping and mobilization processes at the macroscopic scale during hydrodynamic displacement of oil blobs fingering processes can be observed in heterogeneous porous media the oil water emulsion will initially flow primarily through preferential flow paths i e high permeability zones but eventually result in the temporary restriction of oil phase mobility complete blockage of a pore throat can occur causing the flow to follow new paths this effect can initiate the water or flushing solution to flow through the unswept zones i e lower permeability in greater proportion resulting in greater overall sweep efficiencies thomas and ali 1989 engelke et al 2012 zhao et al 2013 2 2 wettability changes and mobility wetting behavior can change with composition of oil fraction and ph of the system morrow 1990 buckley et al 1996 kaminsky and radke 1997 hui and blunt 2000 sheng 2015 under such conditions a porous medium is expected to exist under oil wet conditions for ph 7 acidic and water wet conditions above ph 7 alkaline for heavy crude oil fractions dubey and doe 1993 hirasaki and zhang 2004 bryan and kantzas 2009 booth 2018 an originally oil wet medium can be preferentially changed to a water wet system yielding higher oil recoveries by altering the ph and or salinity through the application of a chemical flushing agent booth 2018 in contrast under certain flushing conditions an originally water wet medium can change to an oil wet condition and the trapped disconnected oil phase may redistribute into a continuous phase either limiting or enhancing recovery potential johnson 1976 schramm 2000 the sorting and distribution of grains can also influence the wettability water wet vs oil wet of heterogeneous porous media and thereby influence the oil recovery potential of a specific system carrigy 1962 hirasaki 1991 dubey and doe 1993 schramm 2000 hirasaki and zhang 2004

the quantitative characterization of the oil phase was carried out by separating phases out from the system i e ex situ these studies focused on quantifying oil morphology and distribution after a single time period of multiphase flow rather than evaluating changes in flow or oil distribution temporally more recently emerging technologies such as computer assisted x ray tomography cat and

3 materials and methods the representative heavy fraction crude oil used for the experiments was san joaquin valley sjv crude chevron richmond ca having an api gravity 14 to improve the image contrast for a particular x ray absorption energy the heavy oil samples were doped with 10 by volume iodobenzene acros organics nj the aqueous water nanopure water and aqueous surfactant phases were doped with 60 g l 1 cesium chloride cscl 99 99 optical grade from acros organics nj for the same purpose previous research has shown that insignificant change in interfacial tension resulted from the addition of cscl dopant to the aqueous phase and negligible partitioning to the oil phase schnaar and brusseau 2006a 2006b ghosh and tick 2013 however minor changes in interfacial tension for the bulk heavy oil occurred due to the addition of iodobenzene ib dopant the addition of approximately 10 vol ib density 1 82 g cm 3 also increased the specific gravity of the heavy crude oil from 14 to 4 2 api and

branched alcohol propoxy sulfate commercially known as petrostep s 1 stepan chemical company northfield il was chosen for its ability to develop low interfacial tension at low concentrations the experiments herein relied on the principal mechanism of surfactant induced mobilization rather than solubilization for the removal and remediation of crude oil napl under low surfactant concentration conditions e g ghosh and tick 2013 booth 2018 this surfactant was developed specifically for enhanced oil recovery eor and surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation sear applications this surfactant was also shown to experience minimal adsorption to the solid phase goddard et al 2004 and high salinity tolerance wu et al 2005 it should be noted that the time interval between surfactant flushing and image capture was 4 h limiting the extent of surfactant adsorption on silica sand and mixtures of silica sand calcareous grains as observed by preliminary tests ghosh 2011 preliminary tests were carried out to ensure that the concentration of the surfactant solution was below the critical micelle concentration cmc 0 9 while simultaneously optimizing the reduction of interfacial tension between the oil and surfactant solution ensuring that mobilization was the dominant mechanism of oil removal ghosh 2011 ghosh and tick 2013 booth 2018 the aqueous cscl flushing solution 60 g l 1 used

model 20 and determined to be 42 3 dyn cm 1 for the oil cscl system i e aqueous residual pre surfactant flush and 24 7 dyn cm 1 for the oil surfactant system i e sear flush this reflects an approximately 42 decrease in interfacial surface tension due to the presence of the surfactant solution three types of unconsolidated sands with increasing physical heterogeneity were used as representative porous media table 2 the particle heterogeneity of the porous media was characterized in terms of uniformity coefficient c u d 60 d 10 the porous media are commercially available unimin corporation ottawa mn and included homogeneous 40 50 accusand with a uniformity coefficient c u equal to 1 mildly heterogeneous accusand c u 5 8 and highly heterogeneous accusand c u 10 6 the latter two heterogeneous porous media types were prepared in the laboratory and added with specific fractions of fine grained silica sands and calcareous soil to achieve particular uniformity coefficients of interest the homogeneous h sand mildly heterogeneous mh sand and highly heterogeneous hh sand sands were characterized by porosities n of 33 27 and 25 mean particle diameters d 50 of 0 35 0 27 and 0

media i e 40 50 mesh and natural calcareous soil were used in these experiments the calcareous soil is characterized as a poorly sorted sandy loam the soil has an alkaline character with a ph of 8 4

silica sand materials is very low o c 0 05 properties of the silica sand media are reported in ghosh and tick 2013 the calcareous soil was also used in other studies to create similar physical heterogeneity for investigating the remediation of dnapl using cyclodextrin surfactant and surfactant enhanced permanganate oxidation reagent scenarios akyol 2018 akyol and turkkan 2018 due to the fact that the calcareous soil natural soil has been well characterized in terms of physical and chemical properties it was selected for addition within silica sand distributions as mixtures to create targeted physical heterogeneity variations in addition the creation of physically heterogeneous porous media using this mixture of calcareous soil and silica sand provide valuable comparison to other studies that used the same and or similar media configurations and can also potentially be compared to other more real world systems with more complex physical chemical distributions akyol 2018 akyol and turkkan 2018 a homogenized mixture of these sands were packed into the columns as a single porous medium in the approximate weight fraction ratios for the mildly heterogeneous 25 calcareous soil

presence of calcium carbonate of the medium the physical heterogeneity effects of calcareous soil versus silica sand on napl recovery have also been identified in other studies akyol and turkkan 2018 akyol 2018 separate thin walled anodized aluminum columns were dry packed with the three different types of porous media these packed columns were 4 4 cm long with an inner diameter i d of 0 5 cm and

heavy oil distribution before initial residual saturation and after each subsequent surfactant flushing event a comprehensive description of the experimental procedures is provided by ghosh and tick 2013 three dimensional imaging techniques have received increasing attention over the last decade and have been used extensively in understanding the pore scale distribution of immiscible liquids nonaqueous phase liquids napl sxm imaging can resolve image resolutions ranging from 1 to 10 μm and even smaller sizes of higher resolution under specific conditions and this technique is capable of imaging multiple phases simultaneously by changing the incident energy level of the photon source x ray beam however this technique can only be used to study relatively small systems up to a few centimeters in thickness previous studies show that sxm imaging has been used successfully to observe and statistically analyze porosity and residual saturation coles et al 1998 pore structure

properties associated with the heavy oil flushing experiments such as changes in the interfacial tension and trapping parameters associated with pre and post surfactant flushing compared to the initial residual saturation heavy oil water system the effect of the surfactant resulted in a 42 reduction of interfacial tension between heavy oil and 0 1 surfactant solution from 42 3 dyn cm 1 to 24 7 dyn cm 1 a corresponding increase 350 in capillary number n c resulted due to surfactant flushing for all three porous media n c was linearly correlated with porous media permeability k for both residual saturation and post flushing conditions with a slope 4 6 greater 4 5 magnitude increase for post flushing conditions although the capillary numbers increased by an order of magnitude values were within the ranges expected for well bore flushing systems using similar alkaline type surfactants cuthiell et al 1995 n c increases were primarily associated with the effect from decreased interfacial tension and therefore remained essentially constant for all three of the porous media systems the bond numbers n b varied between 10 8 and 10 6 depending on the porous medium the n b was linearly correlated with porous media permeability k for both residual saturation and post flushing conditions with a slope 2 greater 2 0 magnitude increase for post flushing conditions the introduction of surfactant flushing had relatively small influence on the post flushing n b 88 increase this suggests that at least during surfactant flushing the buoyancy gravitational component had little effect on oil mobilization processes for range of porous media however when comparing the magnitude of the initial residual n c and n b values i e n b 10 greater than n c for the h sand homogeneous system buoyancy gravitational effects may impose greater control on initial oil mobilization distribution than viscous forces for residual saturation establishment the range of trapping number n t values 3 10 7 2 10 6 was below the threshold values required to initiate immiscible liquid i e napl phase mobilization pennell et al 1996 table 3 increases in n t varied by factors of 2 5 4 0 150 300 as a result of surfactant flushing with values ranging between 1 10 6 and 4 10 6 table 3 for the different porous media systems n t was linearly correlated with porous media permeability k for both residual saturation and post flushing conditions with a slope 2 greater 2 0 magnitude increase for post flushing conditions based on the previously reported threshold values for initial mobilization the surfactant flood would not tend to produce any mobilization of the heavy oil under these conditions however such reported threshold values have only been reported for very specific fluid porous medium systems and may not represent or describe specific conditions for complex multicomponent heavy oil systems whereby physicochemical and porous medium properties are significantly different ghosh and tick 2013 values of weber number n w for residual saturation and post surfactant flushing are presented in table 3 values were determined using the mean oil blob size diameter for the resulting distributions before residual saturation and after sequential surfactant flushing events n w could not be calculated for the oil within the h sand as the distribution remained as a single large ganglion with insignificant changes in morphology during surfactant flushing for the mh and hh sand oil systems surfactant flushing resulted in about a 3 5 fold increase 250 for n w values there was no clear trend for oil bob disintegration break up as a function of weber number due to surfactant flushing 4 2 distribution of heavy oil napl blobs in 2 d and 3 d sections fig 1 a b c shows the distribution of the heavy crude oil in the homogeneous h sand the mildly heterogeneous mh sand and the highly heterogeneous hh sand sands for representative 2 d cross sections along the x z vertical section direction all quantitative results i e recovery morphology surface area volumes etc exclude any oil accumulation along the margins and only represent the interior conditions of the column porous medium matrix only the initial residual oil saturation conditions pre surfactant flood and the resulting oil distribution after subsequent surfactant flushing episodes are presented in fig 1 these images show the oil phase as light white regions and solid media as dark gray to black a relatively high volume of heavy oil present as an initial continuous phase within the h sand system can be observed fig 1a quantitative measurements using post processing blob3d software ketcham 2005 resulted in an initial oil volume and saturation s n within this h sand column system of 34 mm3 and 37 5 respectively table 4 although no major changes occurred in oil phase distribution during the initial episodes of surfactant flushing some mobilization processes were observed due to the preferential flow on the lower half section of the column after the 5 pvs of flushing heavy oil recovery primarily occurred through preferential flow paths along higher permeability zones within the homogeneous medium this observation supports the previous description and basis of enhanced recovery via mobilization processes moreover under such conditions and the short time scale of these experiments oil removal via dissolution processes rate limited would be negligible and further supports the basis that recovery of crude oil occurred dominantly as raw pure phase wettability is also controlled by the interfacial tension between two or more phases a wetting phase i e aqueous solution or water has a tendency to be trapped into the smaller pore spaces of the porous media whereas the relatively more nonwetting phase oil in this case should preferentially occupy the larger pore spaces mercer and cohen 1990 as described the oil phase will tend to be trapped into the larger pores therefore under the premise of the local pore doublet model the trapped oil will preferentially be distributed in 50 of the available large pore spaces in homogeneous porous media ghosh 2011 the other two heterogeneous porous media systems mh sand and hh sand showed a discontinuous oil phase distribution under the initial saturation conditions fig 1b c the heavy oil in the mh sand system exhibited a relatively heterogeneous initial blob distribution with some larger blobs existing at the top and the bottom portions of the column quantitative measurements resulted in an initial oil volume and saturation s n of 3 8 mm3 and 5 1 respectively table 4 during the surfactant flushing events the larger oil blobs were preferentially removed and or redistributed as smaller blobs within the system as displayed by the changes in morphology and volume over flushing time the initial saturation of oil within the hh sand system was also characterized by a heterogeneous distribution of small and large blobs as observed in the 2 d images fig 1c quantitative measurements resulted in an initial oil volume and saturation s n of 1 9 mm3 and 2 8 respectively table 4 notable changes in oil blob morphology and distribution were observed after subsequent flushing events the number of larger blobs preferentially decreased mobilized and or redistributed whereby the pores were gradually dominated by smaller blobs after each flushing episode resulting in minimum oil saturation after 5 pvs of surfactant flushing fig 2 a b c shows the 3 d distributions of the oil blobs within consistently cropped sections 1 5 1 5 4 mm of each column for initial saturation conditions and after subsequent surfactant flushing episodes as noted previously a high initial saturation of oil within the h sand system was generally distributed as a continuous interconnected oil phase through multiple pore networks no significant changes in oil distribution occurred after all surfactant flushing events as observed in the 3 d imaged sections indicating that heavy oil mobilization occurred only through preferential flow during residual saturation establishment the nonwetting fluid heavy oil napl phase will preferentially invade the larger pore spaces due to the reduced capillary pressure required to displace the initial water from these pores thus the wetting fluid aqueous solution will be typically present within the smaller pores size distribution gradually the aqueous phase initially residing in the larger pores will be displaced by the oil phase generally leaving the smallest pores to be filled by aqueous phase solution water phase mercer and cohen 1990 ghosh 2011 in contrast to the oil distribution within the h sand system a relatively uniform distribution of discontinuous oil blobs was present as initial saturation within the other two heterogeneous media systems i e mh sand and hh sand fig 2b c the porous media characteristics i e fraction of fine particles and non uniform particle size distribution were likely primary factors contributing to the initial small discrete oil blob distribution after each successive surfactant flushing event the initial oil blobs were broken down into even smaller blobs and eventually removed or redistributed as they were mobilized from the system this is a common phenomenon found in heterogeneous porous media with significant contrasts in permeabilities mcauliffe 1973 engelke et al 2012 zhao et al 2013 interestingly a local increase of saturation occurred after the first of two surfactant flushing events 2 pv and 3 pv 5 pvs total this increase of local saturation may be due to the initial mobilization redistribution and subsequent trapping of oil blobs within the smaller pore diameters throats of the mh sand system into the scanned section of the column in addition trapped oil phase within the end caps of the column could have mobilized into the scanned portion of the column during the subsequent surfactant flushing events in any event this initial oil mobilization and trapping clogging within the larger pore networks may have led to an increase in sweep efficiency and oil recovery as the flushing fluid would be forced through lower permeability zones larger swept zone although advantageous this process can delay the recovery process and greater recovery may only occur after flushing with many pore volumes of solution for the hh sand system the initial oil distribution was highly heterogeneous exhibiting large and small blobs with smaller sized blobs dominant in number similar to the mh sand system progressively smaller sized oil blobs were observed after subsequent surfactant flushing episodes the resulting disintegration of the oil distribution into smaller blobs is likely due to effects of reduced oil solution interfacial tension associated with the surfactant booth 2018 however this system also showed the accumulation of some larger blobs after 5 pvs of surfactant flushing and this may be in part due to the coalescence redistribution of some smaller blobs during mobilization of all three porous medium systems oil recovery was most pronounced within the hh sand system after 5 pvs of surfactant flushing and the remaining oil distribution within the column was dominated by smaller sized blobs fig 2c these observations were confirmed by both 2 d and 3 d images of the oil distribution fig 1c as well as quantitative results discussed in the following section 4 3 heavy oil napl recovery quantitative results for heavy oil recovery from the three porous media based on 3 d image data are presented in table 4 recoveries quantified for the entire scanned columns neglecting cropped section along central part of the column were in good agreement with the observed results from the representative cropped 2 d and 3 d image sections for the h sand system a net gain of 4 7 heavy oil occurred after the first 2 pv surfactant flood indicating that oil phase was remobilized into the scanned column region during this flushing step after the second surfactant flushing event 3 pv 5 pv total a 10 1 net oil recovery resulted with respect to maximum volume i e after 2 pvs moreover the total surface area of the entire oil phase distribution increased by 7 2 after the 2 pv flood but decreased slightly by 1 4 after 5 pvs of surfactant flushing with respect to the previous 2 pv condition table 5 clearly the surfactant application and resulting oil water interfacial reduction was insufficient to induce significant oil recovery in this case the relatively high permeability of the medium resulted in the formation of a continuous heavy oil phase through an initially water wet porous medium system since the hydrodynamic gradient is imposed over the entire length of the continuous oil distribution a greater n c critical capillary number may have been required for mobilization of the continuous phase larger ganglion wardlaw and mckellar 1985 proposed that a critical capillary number ccn has to be achieved for mobilization of the blobs and that any capillary number less than the critical number can result in blob separation and redistribution within the pore spaces wettability is another factor that can control the oil trapping mechanism in such systems the 2 d vertical imaged column section of the oil water distribution i e initial residual saturation showed a discontinuous aqueous phase in the presence of a relatively continuous oil phase prior to oil imbibition the homogeneous sand system was saturated with water electrolyte solution thereby establishing initially water wet conditions during crude oil injection imbibition as the oil phase displaced the water phase the system may have been altered into an oil wet condition for example san joaquin valley sjv heavy crude oil has been noted to exhibit oil wetting behavior to silica sand at a ph 7 schramm 2000 dubey and doe 1993 burden 2012 reported that sjv heavy crude oil contained 8 9 by weight asphaltenes previous research has shown that heavy crude oil systems comprising high asphaltene content under low ph condition i e ph 4 tend to exhibit oil wetting conditions within silica sands resulting in greater trapping and immobilization of the oil phase buckley et al 1996 booth 2018 showed in heavy crude oil same oil used in the study herein contact angle laboratory experiments kruss gmbh drop shape analyzer dsa 1 hamburg germany with silica media borosilicate plates systems that increasingly water wet conditions resulted as ph increased over a specific range ph 4 13 the ph measured for the cscl solution was 5 6 under laboratory temperature i e 20 c establishing residual saturation of heavy oil through aqueous flushing brine solution i e cscl water proved to be challenging and may be due to development of an oil wet system at this ph condition moreover the surfactant application may have helped maintain an oil wet condition the ph measurement for the anionic surfactant in contact with 40 50 silica sand was approximately 3 6 all sxm images were taken within 24 h of surfactant application and the system ph stabilized at 3 94 after 24 h since there was no measurable oil recovery after 2 pvs of surfactant flushing and approximately only 10 recovery after 5 pvs of flushing it can be concluded that the critical capillary number may have been achieved at some point during the second 3 pv between 2 and 5 pvs surfactant flood resulting in some recovery for the mh sand system a net gain of 10 5 heavy oil by volume occurred after the first 2 pv surfactant flood indicating that oil phase was remobilized into the scanned column region during this flushing step after the second surfactant flushing event 3 pv 5 pv total a 6 5 net oil recovery resulted with respect to maximum volume i e after 2 pvs table 4 moreover the total surface area of the entire oil phase distribution increased by 11 3 after the 2 pv flood and by 3 9 after 5 pvs of surfactant flushing with respect to the previous 2 pv condition table 5 under this condition it may be that the reduced oil solution interfacial tension from the surfactant may have initiated break up disintegration of the oil blobs since the water phase was the continuous phase in this case it is expected that surfactant contact with the oil phase would be maximized thereby aiding in the break up mobilization of the oil blobs however the data reveal that a relatively low net recovery resulted even after 5 pvs of flushing i e 7 vol with respect to the previous 2 pv condition the ph for this system measured 8 25 during the surfactant flood and stabilized at 8 13 after 24 h this higher ph is attributed to the buffering capacity associated with the fine carbonate fraction of the porous medium and may be in part responsible for maintaining a water wet condition whereby smaller blobs are generated during the flushing process for the hh sand system an increasing trend of heavy oil recovery occurred after each surfactant flushing episode 2 pv and 3 pv total of 5 pvs table 4 a total of 37 with respect to initial oil saturation heavy oil recovery was achieved after 5 pvs of surfactant flushing similar to the previous description for the mh sand surfactant flushing experiments it may be that the reduced oil solution interfacial tension from the surfactant may have initiated break up disintegration of the oil blobs however it should be noted that the total initial trapped oil volume in this system was relatively low compared to the more homogeneous sand systems although progressively smaller blobs resulted after each surfactant flushing event the total surface area decreased continuously indicating that oil removal was relatively efficient and that the displacement process generally occurred over the entire length of the system throughout the flushing process i e continuous recovery behavior the two heterogeneous porous media mh and hh sand showed discontinuous oil phase distributions present for the initial residual saturation conditions the heavy oil in the mildly heterogeneous medium mh sand experiment exhibited a relatively heterogeneous blob distribution with larger blobs predominantly existing at the top and the bottom portions of the column oil recovery processes affected the larger distribution of oil blobs initially as the time series images revealed the preferential disappearance of the larger blobs from the system residual oil saturation within the highly heterogeneous porous medium hh sand was also characterized by a highly heterogeneous distribution of large and small oil blobs in 2 d image section in contrast to the other more homogeneous sand systems h and mh sands this system may not have experienced such dramatic preferential flow impacts whereby progressively smaller oil particles were able to flush through the system without becoming significantly clogged or trapped the relatively high ph measured for this system was stable at 8 31 and is attributed to the high buffering capacity associated with the fine carbonate fraction within the porous medium system and may be in part responsible for maintaining a water wet condition under such conditions it is expected that the smaller blobs generated during the flushing process may have also contributed to the significantly greater oil recovery in contrast to the mh sand system whereby much lower oil recovery occurred potentially due to less significant water wetting conditions and or related oil clogging and or oil blob coalescence effects 4 4 heavy oil napl blob distribution quantitative results for heavy oil distribution from the three porous media based on 3 d image data are presented in table 5 changes in crude oil blob distribution and morphology in a particular porous medium can impact oil recovery during surfactant flushing the sxm based imaging techniques make it possible to quantify oil blob volume surface area and specific surface area for each individual blob during the flushing process i e before and after additionally coefficients of variation and uniformity can be determined for the entire oil blob distribution pre or post surfactant flushing indicating general blob morphology changes during removal processes results showed that significant change in blob morphology of heavy crude oil resulted due to the surfactant application process however the heavy oil distribution trapped in the two heterogeneous media mh and hh sand show no significant change in oil blob morphology or shape over the sequential flushing episodes the larger blobs distributed within both of these heterogeneous media systems exhibited elongated and tabular surface areas which were easily differentiated from the oil distributions within the homogeneous media characterization of the oil blob distribution provides important information about the stability of blob morphologies and mobilization processes within a porous medium of known porosity and permeability although few in number the larger blobs generally represent the largest fraction of the oil distribution by volume fig 3a conventionally this type of distribution is characterized and compared by log normal cumulative distribution plots the generated plots figs 3 5 compare the oil blob specific surface area as a function of oil blob volume within a particular medium where the dark bold line represents the model curve representing the blob distribution as perfect spheres minimum surface area condition for all respective equivalent blob volumes any deviation along a vertical line from that model curve represents larger surface area consistent with more complex non spherical blob morphology these types of plots are most useful for characterizing disconnected oil blob distributions the oil distribution within the h sand system predominantly remained as a large continuous interconnected ganglion over the duration of the multiple surfactant flushing events although there was a total oil recovery of up to 10 negligible changes of oil ganglion morphology resulted during the surfactant flushing process therefore a log normal cumulative distribution plot is of limited value fig 3a b however the results from this system can provide important information regarding the type of oil distribution single interconnected mass that might be expected for heavy oil fractions within homogeneous uniform type porous media systems the cumulative distribution of the oil blobs in the mh sand system was characterized by a relatively heterogeneous distribution under the initial saturation condition fig 4a b this trend remained nearly the same after each of the surfactant flushing episodes the blob volumes ranged from 10 5 to 10 1 mm3 after each of the three surfactant flushing episodes for all flushing episodes the mean and median blob sizes varied on the order of 1 49 10 4 mm3 and 6 6 10 5 mm3 respectively table 5 detailed observation of the distribution pattern revealed insignificant changes in blob size after 2 pvs of flushing and the larger blobs increased slightly in volume likely as a result of coalescence or redistribution through oil mobilization processes over the duration of 5 pvs of surfactant flushing the oil blobs became smaller consistent with the previous observations the uniformity coefficient c u and coefficient of variation c v were used to compare the heterogeneity of the oil blob size distribution c v varied from 6 to 6 4 and c u varied from 3 5 to 3 9 for initial saturation condition and after total flushing duration 5 pvs respectively table 5 these values reveal the mild heterogeneity nature of the oil blob distribution and that minimal changes in the blob morphology occurred as a result of the various surfactant flushing events the larger oil blobs exhibited maximum deviations from a spherical shape for instance all blob volumes 10 4 mm3 mean volume pre and or post surfactant flushing deviated significantly from a spherical shape the quantitative data also showed that there was no significant change in the total oil blob surface area pre and or post surfactant flushing for this particular system mh sand the sxm imaged sections confirmed that new blobs were formed i e coalesced or redistributed resulting in increasing total oil blob surface area within the system during surfactant flushing likely due to reduced interfacial tension interactions between the oil and flushing phases the recovery processes described herein were likely primarily controlled by the permeability of the porous medium the relatively low oil recovery observed from the mh sand system over the duration of 5 pvs of surfactant flushing may be the result of oil clogging and or oil blob coalescence effects such impacts may also be in part related to wettability effects the relatively lower carbonate fraction in comparison to the hh sand system may not have induced as much of a water wet condition thereby resulting in relatively lower oil recovery booth 2018 conducted the drop shape analysis to understand the chemical reaction of crude oil in an alkaline solution to examine the wettability effects measurements of contact angle θ and ift show significant change in the wettability of the system as a function of ph even for slight changes in ph in general as ph increased over ranges ph 4 13 resulting decreases in contact angle between the oil phase and borosilicate plate occurred yielding increasingly water wet conditions i e aqueous phase as the wetting agent as opposed to larger contact angles resulting in preferential oil wet conditions i e oil as the wetting agent additionally the reduction of interfacial tension ift between the oil napl and aqueous phases resulted as ph increased it is expected that the dissolution of carbonate minerals from infiltrating rain water carbonic acid in subsurface systems would impact solution ph and thereby change system fluid media contact angles and ift persistent low ph conditions infiltrating rain water could transition a system to be more oil wet whereas dissolution of carbonate rich minerals would tend to increase ph conditions transitioning the system to become more water wet values for contact angle and ift were used to calculate changes in capillary pressure allowing for the determination of pressure thresholds required for napl mobilization to occur in saturated porous media the oil blob distribution within the hh sand system was characterized by a progressive decrease in blob volume after each successive surfactant flushing episode fig 5a b oil blob size varied significantly 10 5 to 10 2 mm3 for the initial saturation condition representing a relatively heterogeneous initial oil distribution the maximum oil blob volume present i e initial saturation was an order of magnitude smaller than the largest oil blob present within the mh sand system the initial mean oil blob volume of 9 2 10 5 mm3 decreased to 6 6 10 5 mm3 30 reduction after a total of 5 pvs of surfactant flushing fig 5a a 14 reduction of median oil blob volume 2 9 10 5 to 2 5 10 5 mm3 was quantified for this same flushing period the oil blob distribution became progressively more homogeneous after each sequential surfactant flushing event over 5 total pvs of surfactant flushing oil blob distribution c u and c v decreased from 2 7 to 2 4 and from 12 6 to 3 7 respectively table 5 changes in the oil blob morphology were generally consistent becoming smaller as oil blob volume decreased after each successive surfactant flushing episode fig 5b a good correlation was determined between the total relative blob surface area and oil recovery after surfactant flushing fig 6 no particular trend was established between surface area and recovery for the more homogenous porous media systems h and mh indicating that removal process within the highly heterogeneous sand i e sand and carbonate fine fraction system was significantly different to that of the more homogenous porous media systems this may indicate that ph and related wettability changes may have a significant control on the removal processes in these more carbonate alkaline sand systems 5 summary and conclusions a pore scale study was conducted to understand the in situ trapping and mobilization processes controlling the removal recovery of a heavy fraction crude oil napl during progressive stages of surfactant flushing for various unconsolidated sands of increasing heterogeneity non uniformity temporal changes of oil distribution and oil blob morphology were quantified in terms of oil mobilization and recovery under the conditions of these experiments heavy fraction crude oil trapped within physically uniform homogeneous porous media may present challenges for removal as the viscous forces needed to overcome the interfacial forces over the entire trapped ganglia domain may be too great to initiate effective mobilization in this case whereby specific surface area of the oil distribution was relatively low the role of this interfacial parameter and oil geometry was likely an important factor limiting surfactant hydraulic accessibility and thus mobilization of the heavy oil for this sand h sand system the hydraulic accessibility contact of surfactant solution i e discontinuous aqueous phase with the oil phase was likely limited sweep efficiency thus this phenomenon reduced interfacial activity and consequently resulted in less oil recovery for this particular system the observed limited recovery in this system h sand may also be associated with changes of wettability from water wet to oil wet conditions for low buffering capacity i e quartz rich reservoirs systems in addition sorption of surfactant was also negligible to the silica sand and silica sand calcareous soil mixture goddard et al 2004 ghosh 2011 booth 2018 the results demonstrate that potential alteration from water wet to oil wet conditions may be a critical factor limiting the mobilization of crude oil in the homogeneous porous medium system indicating that media surface chemistry effects can significantly control removal processes even when pore size distribution is relatively large and uniform porous media sorting and permeability are also significant factors controlling discontinuous oil blob trapping and distribution the porous media systems with higher overall heterogeneity and smaller mean permeability distribution were observed to preferentially result in discontinuous oil distributions during oil phase displacement and formation of residual oil saturation the oil distribution within more physically heterogeneous porous media systems was stable after surfactant flushing as observed by the formation or redistribution of smaller blobs through the reduction of oil water interfacial tension in the mh sand system delayed oil recovery i e 5 pv flushing was observed whereby local oil saturation is primarily restricted by smaller pore diameters until a point at which reduction of oil solution interfacial tension initiates blob disintegration and eventual mobilization recovery for such heterogeneous systems greater oil recovery may be expected at later stages of surfactant flushing due to the formation of smaller blobs whereby hydraulic accessibility of surfactant increases throughout low permeability zones resulting in improved sweep efficiencies as oil blobs in an emulsion mobilize they tend to be captured in relatively smaller pore throats consequently the aqueous phase is forced to flow to the less permeable zones producing greater sweep efficiency this phenomenon was also observed in other studies thomas and ali 1989 hunky et al 2010 romero 2009 bryan and kantzas 2009 liu et al 2006 booth 2018 physically heterogeneous porous media systems or reservoirs with relatively high carbonate fine fraction content and high buffering capacities i e hh sand may be more amenable to sustained oil recovery due to more significant wettability alterations during oil phase displacement and formation of residual oil saturation under the conditions of these experiments hh sand the oil distribution was increasingly stable whereby oil blobs progressively decreased in sized break up resulting in steady oil recovery of approximately 20 after each subsequent surfactant flushing event this was observed by the formation or redistribution of progressively greater number of smaller and more uniform blob distribution after each surfactant flushing episode likely the result of more efficient reduction of interfacial tension associated with the increased surfactant oil contact as better sweep efficiency the associated higher ph sand fine carbonate system may have aided in maintaining a water wet porous medium a condition more conducive to higher oil recovery and displacement efficiency the overall results of this research demonstrate that high resolution in situ characterization i e sxm imaging techniques of changing oil distributions during surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation sear applications can be used to reveal the primary pore scale processes responsible for heavy oil fraction mobilization and recovery in various porous media systems some replication experiments when feasible showed that there was minimal variation of the organic liquid oil surface areas and volumes for initial saturations and resulting oil distributions after surfactant flushing this indicates that the laboratory methods and sxm processing techniques used in this study were robust additionally this research demonstrates that such sxm imaging and fluid phase quantification techniques may be useful for interpreting oil trapping mobilization and related recovery due to wettability shifts induced by changes in porous medium solution ph during enhanced flushing these factors are critical when evaluating the conditions such as oil blob size distribution and blob morphologies most favorable for enhanced recovery from a particular oil contaminated porous medium system these results could provide an improved general basis and guide to assess interpolate and or extrapolate recovery potential for the porous media containing heavy oil fractions similar in nature and therefore aid in predicting specific oil contaminated systems most amenable for surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation sear in addition the processes based on microscopic images of emulsified blobs were prepared externally and injected into the porous media the unique and innovative research as part of this detailed study was used to conduct an in situ three dimensional 3 d pore scale investigation of heavy oil recovery and blob distribution within some typical reservoir porous medium types in order to understand the interfacial processes due to surfactant application for enhanced specifically heavy oil oil recovery seor understanding the effects of surfactant flushing for heavy crude oil fractions should also be taken into account to provide better site characterization and more efficient site remediation as a result the performance of this technology depends on the site specific characteristics i e medium heterogeneity mineralogy and surface chemistry that are critical for the development of proper site characterization accurate risk

1584,bioaugmentation is an option for aerobic remediation of groundwater contaminated with 1 4 dioxane one approach uses microbes that cometabolize 1 4 dioxane following growth on a primary substrate e g propane whereas another uses microbes e g pseudonocardia dioxivorans cb1190 capable of using 1 4 dioxane as a sole substrate the relative merits of these approaches are difficult to distinguish based on field data alone and theoretical analyses of these processes have yet to be published the objective of this study was to compare these remediation options using a transport model that incorporates advection dispersion and biodegradation reactions described by multi substrate monod kinetics and co inhibition effects the transport model was coupled to an approximate steady state air sparging simulation used to estimate gas propane and oxygen distribution at the field scale the model was calibrated with field data for 1 4 dioxane and propane concentrations from a previously reported pilot study the two remediation approaches were evaluated under different conditions that vary the initial concentration of 1 4 dioxane and the loading rates of oxygen propane and biomass the metrics used to evaluate the remediation success were the time to reach an average 1 4 dioxane concentration of 1 μg l 1 and the percent of 1 4 dioxane biodegraded after 10 years of simulation results indicate that the initial concentration of 1 4 dioxane strongly influences which remediation approach is more effective when initial concentrations were 10 mg l 1 propane driven cometabolism led to faster remediation whereas metabolic biodegradation was faster when initial concentrations were 10 mg l 1 or higher below 0 25 mg l 1 the viability of metabolic biodegradation improved although cometabolism by propanotrophs still required less time to reach 1 μg l 1 biomass injection rates had a strong effect on the rate of metabolism but not cometabolism because continuous input of primary substrate supported growth of propanotrophs the performance of both cultures was negatively affected by a decrease in oxygen injection rate the endogenous decay coefficient and the dispersion rate for biomass had a significant impact on cometabolic and metabolic biodegradation of 1 4 dioxane the maximum specific rate for cometabolism of 1 4 dioxane the dispersion rate for 1 4 dioxane and effective porosity also had significant effects on the time to achieve remediation with propanotrophs keywords 1 4 dioxane biodegradation biosparging bioaugmentation contaminant transport model 1 introduction 1 4 dioxane has become a priority for remediation due to its status as a probable human carcinogen and its presence at numerous contaminated sites across the united states adamson et al 2014 in situ biodegradation of 1 4 dioxane is an alternative to energy intensive physicochemical techniques laboratory studies have shown aerobic biodegradation can be achieved by metabolic and cometabolic microbes mahendra and alvarez cohen 2006 sei et al 2013 zenker et al 2002 since several key genes required for aerobic metabolism of 1 4 dioxane are carried on plasmids grostern et al 2012 there is reason to expect that horizontal gene transfer has distributed degradation capabilities across many different microbes the number of isolates identified from environmental media with the ability to biodegrade this compound continues to increase he et al 2017 sei et al 2013 cometabolism of contaminants such as chlorinated aliphatics and methyl tert butyl ether has been demonstrated in field applications where methane or propane served as the primary growth substrate delivered via air sparging gelhar et al 2010 steffan et al 1997 cometabolism of 1 4 dioxane has also been performed at the pilot scale by air sparging with propane as the primary substrate and bioaugmentation with the propanotroph rhodococcus ruber env425 at vandenberg air force base vafb lippincott et al 2015 metabolic biodegradation of 1 4 dioxane has many potential advantages compared to cometabolism with metabolism there is no need to amend the groundwater with a primary substrate the oxygen demand is considerably lower and there is less chance of clogging an aquifer due to excessive growth nevertheless there are also challenges in dilute plumes the concentration of 1 4 dioxane may be too low to support biodegradation as a sole substrate as a result the kinetics of biodegradation may be slow when the concentration of 1 4 dioxane is low barajas rodríguez and freedman 2018 compared the rates of 1 4 dioxane biodegradation under metabolic and cometabolic conditions using kinetic constants for pseudonocardia dioxanivorans cb1190 and a mixed consortium of propanotrophs env487 batch simulations indicated that propanotrophs decreased 1 4 dioxane from 1000 to 1 μg l 1 in less time than cb1190 when the initial biomass concentration was 0 74 mg on an electron equivalents basis per liter whereas metabolic biodegradation was favored at higher initial biomass concentrations and higher initial 1 4 dioxane concentrations however this comparison was limited to suspended growth conditions so the effects under field conditions remain unclear these effects could be evaluated by incorporating the kinetic model from the laboratory in a subsurface transport model that includes effects of in situ conditions biodegradation models that include multiple biodegradation pathways and substrates such as biorxntrn wang and papenguth 2001 biomoc essaid and bekins 1997 min3p mayer et al 2001 and miser chen et al 2013 have been applied to simulate mass transport and biodegradation of contaminants biomoc allows for multiple chemical compounds with a monod model for biodegradation and includes noncompetitive competitive and biomass inhibition factors min3p is capable of simulating multiple substrates terminal electron acceptors and inhibitors miser has been used to simulate biodegradation of chlorinated solvents by two microbial populations with lactate serving as the electron donor as well as inhibition and capabilities for multiple chemical compounds in situ cometabolism of chlorinated aliphatics has been simulated using monod kinetics for methane oxidizing bacteria semprini and mccarty 1991 semprini and mccarty 1992 nevertheless models that simulate metabolism and cometabolism of 1 4 dioxane in an aquifer in response to biosparging and bioaugmentation are currently unavailable this shortcoming is limiting the ability to evaluate factors affecting the performance of 1 4 dioxane bioremediation the purpose of this study is to overcome this limitation we do this by describing an analysis of biosparging and bioaugmentation that includes biodegradation reactions and then we compared the results to observations at a field site 2 materials and methods this paper uses a theoretical analysis to evaluate bioremediation of 1 4 dioxane the analysis is developed by first describing concepts that lead to an overview of the theoretical model governing equations and boundary conditions are then identified and we outline the method for implementing solution of the equations 2 1 conceptual model the model simulations performed in this study were used to compare the performance of metabolic and cometabolic bacteria under equivalent environmental conditions while incorporating differences in their kinetic characteristics barajas rodríguez and freedman 2018 field data from vafb were used to develop the geometry and parameters for the model lippincott et al 2015 at vafb an injection well was installed to deliver air and propane into a confined aquifer contaminated with 1 4 dioxane four monitoring wells were placed near the injection well and within the 1 4 dioxane plume the aquifer unit consists of well graded sand with gravel and zones of silty fine sand the aquifer is approximately 1 4 m thick and the porosity is assumed to be 0 3 the upper confining layer consists of low permeability silts and silty sandy clays whereas the underlying layer is mostly lean clay lippincott et al 2015 air entered at the injection well and traveled away from it the flow was driven by the injection gas pressure the buoyancy of the gas and upward gas leakage through fractures and discontinuities in the confining layer during the pilot scale study at vafb air was injected once per day for 45 min at 10 ft3 min 1 during the first 28 days propane injections began on day 29 once per day on day 37 air and propane were injected in six cycles per day with air added for 6 min and propane for 30 during each cycle presumably the gas saturations increased sharply and displaced water during the 45 min of injection and then gas saturation dropped as water refilled some pores during the 23 25 h between injections the mass of injected gas would occupy approximately 5586 m3 at the pressure of the aquifer and this would displace a significant fraction of the pore volume of water within a region 36 m from the injection well this level of gas saturation was not observed which indicates that some of the injected gas leaked upward through the confining layer propane was detected in some monitoring wells lippincott personal communication so the monitoring wells were responsible for some of the gas leakage it seems likely that gas also leaked upward through relatively high permeability zones in the confining unit gas flow rates and gas saturations were expected to vary rapidly due to the brief high rate injection periods and the spatial distribution of gas was expected to be complex due to leakage through the confining unit in areas that were unknown to us fig s1 this high spatial and temporal variability in the gas saturation was impossible to simulate in detail given the available data early simulations evaluated individual gas injection cycles and while this is possible the required time steps are small and the simulations are excessively long as a result we assumed that sparging delivery of oxygen and propane could be represented using a steady mass injection rate that was equal to the average rate in the field moreover we assumed that gas leakage through the confining layer occurred at a rate that was proportional to the gas pressure but this proportionality was uniformly distributed the sparging process was responsible for the introduction and transport of oxygen and propane and the metabolism of microbes was responsible for consumption of oxygen and propane and cometabolism of 1 4 dioxane 2 2 theoretical model the model concepts were simulated using a 2d plan view geometry in cartesian coordinates a circular region with a 30 m diameter was used to define a 1 4 dioxane plume similar to the one described in the pilot study at vafb an injection well was located at the center of the domain fig 1 air sparging conditions in the pilot study were approximated by dividing the aquifer thickness into five uniform layers at different depths the average capillary pressure in each layer was calculated fig s 1 and used to determine the relative permeabilities and the phase saturations of the fluids therefore this model includes the vertical variation in saturation and flow rate that would occur during sparging but the simplified approach avoids explicitly calculating flow in the vertical direction another assumption was that the air sparging process was at steady state this is based on the arguments outlined above and ignoring temporal variations during air sparging which is consistent with lundergard and andersen 1993 it seems likely that the large fluctuations in flow during sparging could cause significant mixing in the vertical direction vertical mixing of biomass in the water phase was represented by including an effective dispersion parameter that was estimated using field data the gas and water saturations and the relative permeability were related to air and water pressures using the brooks and corey equations brooks and corey 1964 under the assumptions discussed in the conceptual model section the reactive transport model for cometabolism predicted concentrations in the water phase for 1 4 dioxane c dissolved propane s dissolved oxygen o and biomass x for the metabolic simulations propane was omitted and 1 4 dioxane served as the growth substrate s only propane s gas and oxygen o gas were predicted for the gas phase the model was calibrated with monitoring data from the vafb pilot study the plume of 1 4 dioxane was characterized by three uniform concentration zones of 1100 550 and 100 μg l 1 fig 1 oxygen and propane entered at the injection well in the gas phase and their mass transfer rates into the water phase was controlled by their solubility and a global mass transfer coefficient adsorption and volatilization were ignored because the distribution coefficient and henry s law coefficient for 1 4 dioxane are relatively low biomass transport was assumed to occur by advection and dispersion in the water phase dispersion was assumed to occur due to vertical and horizontal mixing caused by the sparging process 2 3

kinetic parameters adjusted for a temperature of 15 c are summarized in table s1 2 5 boundary and initial conditions the initial gas pressure was set equal to the hydrostatic pressure allowing a smooth start of the numerical simulations the initial concentrations of propane and oxygen in the gas phase were zero the initial concentrations of propane oxygen and biomass in the water phase were zero the initial 1 4 dioxane concentration consisted of three concentration zones of 1100 550 and 100 μg l 1 located at the same position as described in the vafb pilot study fig 1 boundary conditions for the model are summarized in table 1 the hydrostatic water pressure was set to 45 000 pa based on the hydrogeologic description from the vafb pilot study lippincott et al 2015 for the gas phase an injection pressure of 52 000 pa was specified at the injection well for the first 29 days when only oxygen was added this pressure was specified to be consistent with the amount of air delivered in the pilot study between days 29 and 37 oxygen and propane were added at the same injection pressure after day 37 the pressure was increased to 59 000 pa this increase was made to be consistent with the increase in the air sparging injection cycles used in the vafb pilot study the outer boundary of the model was open flow to allow gas water and species to move away from the model domain fig 1

shorter length of time is typically used to achieve bioaugmentation in the field periods 24 h led to computational instability with the model 2 6 model implementation comsol version 5 2 was used to implement the model calibration and to perform the analysis to assess the effect of different parameters on the time to achieve a bioremediation goal calibration of the model to the data observed in the field demonstration at vafb was used as a baseline scenario one of the reasons for using comsol is its ability to incorporate the complex biodegradation kinetics and to readily couple a gas and water flow model the parameters considered for calibrating the model are shown in table 2 of these six were adjusted so that the model adequately predicted the 1 4 dioxane concentrations observed in the field at four monitoring wells there was no data available for the gas distribution from the pilot study therefore the flow was calibrated to match the aqueous propane distribution observed in the field lippincott et al 2015 each parameter was adjusted by using the parametric sweep tool in comsol a fluid dynamics triangular meshing of the domain was customized in order to refine the grid in the 1 4 dioxane plume fig s2 the mesh was refined as a boundary mesh for the domain containing the injection well this was done to have a smooth mesh element size transition from the well boundary to the rest of the domain the rest of the mesh was set as free triangular further information on the calibration process and numerical implementation is presented by barajas rodríguez 2016 after performing the model calibration and sensitivity analysis of the model parameters the performance of cb1190 metabolizes 1 4 dioxane and the propanotroph env425 cometabolizes 1 4 dioxane was compared variations in the initial 1 4 dioxane concentrations and propane oxygen and biomass input fluxes were performed to evaluate their effect on bioremediation the same metrics used in the sensitivity analysis were followed i e the time to achieve an average 1 4 dioxane concentration of 1 μg l 1 and percentage of contaminant degraded after 10 years this comparison was the main outcome of the present study 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration for cometabolic bioremediation the parameters in table 1 were adjusted to achieve a mass flux of air of 6 44 10 4 m s 1 into the aquifer at the injection

obtained fig s3 the model closely followed the rise in propane concentrations after its addition on day 29 fig 2 the predicted propane concentration reached approximately 250 and 210 μg l 1 for wells 47b and 2b which are located closest to the injection well fig 1 however the highest measured concentration was 110 μg l 1 a similar pattern was observed for the distant wells in which the predicted peak concentration of propane was 95 and 130 μg l 1 and the measured peak concentrations were 65 and 75 μg l 1 respectively the model also predicted the consumption of propane following the addition of biomass on day 42 however the decrease in propane concentration is slower for the simulation since it took between 300 and 400 d to reach zero whereas the field data had a faster decrease and reached the detection limit in 50 days the more rapid decreases in propane observed in the field may be a consequence of the difficulty in measuring low concentrations of dissolved gases in situ consumption of propane by indigenous propanotrophs losses via wells as conduits or heterogeneities in aquifer lithology that are not necessarily captured by the simple layered model but may influence groundwater concentrations in a well sample screened over multiple feet the model fits the 1 4 dioxane field data from the monitoring wells near the injection well better than for the more distant wells fig 3 according to the field data biodegradation of 1 4 dioxane was similar in the two monitoring wells located near the injection well i e 47b and 2b 1 4 dioxane concentrations decreased at approximately the same time in both of these wells falling below 2 μg l 1 after 210 days this was not the case for the more distant monitoring wells 5b and 34b even though those wells were at similar distances from the injection well they were located in opposite directions fig 1 monitoring well 5b did not show any significant decrease in 1 4 dioxane during biosparging however well 34b showed a decrease in concentration from 136 to 8 9 μg l 1 in only 61 days it should be noted that well 5b was a previously installed broadly screened well that appeared to cross multiple aquifer units and was not well connected to the propane sparge well discrepancies between the model prediction for 1 4 dioxane in the distant wells 5b and 34b with respect to the field data measurements may be attributable to heterogeneities in the aquifer that provide more open channels for propane and biomass to move towards 34b similarly heterogeneities such as clay lenses may be blocking the flow of propane towards mw 5b thus preventing biomass growth the model assumes that the porous medium between the injection well and the monitoring wells is homogeneous therefore the biodegradation prediction is an intermediate case for the observed concentrations in both distant wells fitting of the 1 4 dioxane data from the pilot study was the primary criterion for adjusting the transport and kinetic parameters for model calibration after an adequate trend on propane concentration rise and decrease was predicted by the model parameters such as d h w x d h w c d h w o b and the maximum specific rate for cometabolic biodegradation of 1 4 dioxane q cmax were adjusted the total sums of squared errors for the four wells was 4 6 10 6 kg cod m 3 2 however it is important to look at the sums of squared errors from each well since the initial concentrations varied among them well 5b had an initial 1 4 dioxane concentration of 555 μg l 1 1 10 3 kg cod m 3 and well 34b started at 135 μg l 1 2 4 10 4 kg cod m 3 the closest wells 47b and 2b had initial concentrations of 1090 μg l 1 2 10 3 kg cod m 3 and 997 μg l 1 1 8 10 3 kg cod m 3 respectively the sum of squared errors was 8 2 10 8 kg cod m 3 2 for well 34b and 3 04 10 6 kg cod m 3 2 for 5b even though the initial concentration of well 5b is five times higher than 34b its sum of squared errors is four orders of magnitude higher in order to decide on the most adequate model fit attention was paid mostly to wells 47b and 2b which are in the highest 1 4 dioxane concentration zone the sums of squared errors for wells 47b and 2b were 2 7 10 7 kg cod m 3 2 and 1 41 10 6 kg cod m 3 2 respectively considering only wells 47b and 2b the sum of squared errors calculated was 1 65 10 6 kg cod m 3 2 for the calibrated parameters 3 2 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was performed for 11 parameters to investigate their effects on 1 4 dioxane biodegradation the simulation time was extended to 10 years in order to capture long term trends a summary of the results is shown in table 3 in terms of the percentage of 1 4 dioxane biodegraded and the time to reach a remediation goal of 1 μg l 1 the impacts were rated as significant 30 from the base case moderately significant 5 to 30 change relative to the base case a low level of significance 5 change relative to the base case or no impact on the outcome the two parameters that had a significant impact on cometabolic and metabolic biodegradation of 1 4 dioxane were the endogenous decay coefficient b and the dispersion rate of biomass d h w x the sensitivity of b based on the percentage of 1 4 dioxane degraded was significant for cometabolic and metabolic conditions fig s4a and was significant based on the time to reach the remediation goal for cometabolic conditions fig s4b when b was set above 25 of the experimentally determined value the average 1 4 dioxane concentration decreased at a slower rate the concentration of 1 4 dioxane did not reach 1 μg l 1 even after 10 years a concentration of 1 μg l 1 was only reached when b was between 0 and 10 of the laboratory determined value the percentage of 1 4 dioxane that was biodegraded after 10 years decreased to 20 when b was set to the experimentally determined value revealing its highly significant long term impact biological kinetic parameters can vary widely under in situ conditions chambon julie et al 2012 kovárová kovar and egli 1998 and changes in the physiological state of biomass under such conditions suggest that lower decay rates may occur when the primary growth substrate is available at low concentrations lobos et al 2005 perez padilla and grady jr 1998 the sensitivity of the biomass dispersion coefficient in water d h w x based on the percentage of 1 4 dioxane degraded and the time to reach the remediation goal was significant for cometabolic and metabolic conditions fig s5 d h w x was varied over several orders of magnitude and had a negative effect on the percentage of 1 4 dioxane biodegraded when its value was below 1 10 8 m2 s 1 the faster the biomass moved away from the injection well the easier it was for biomass to catch up with the propane and oxygen and thus achieve higher growth rates for the lowest value tested 1 10 9 m2 s 1 there was no biodegradation of 1 4 dioxane a considerable difference in remediation times was observed between 1 10 8 m2 s 1 which required 40 years and 5 10 8 m2 s 1 which achieved the remediation goal in 4 0 years when dispersion was higher than 1 10 6 m2 s 1 complete biodegradation was still achieved after 10 years the trend for cb1190 was similar with decreasing remediation times as dispersion of biomass increased since higher biomass dispersion allowed bacteria to reach the 1 4 dioxane faster biomass growth was promoted earlier and the remediation time was reduced however when d h w x was too high the biomass moved past the substrate and resulted in poor performance it is important to note that biomass movement was approximated in this study by adjusting the dispersion coefficient in the water phase it would be more accurate to model biomass movement as a function of the groundwater velocity as well as the properties of the bacterial cells that impact transport e g straining settling attachment and detachment this would require that special attention be given to the groundwater flow conditions generated during biosparging and to the regional groundwater flow as well as the type of culture injected it is also noteworthy that the model does not take into account the possibility that indigenous propanotrophs contributed to 1 4 dioxane biodegradation during the vafb field trial even though propanotrophs are widely distributed e g chu et al 2018 tupa and masuda 2018 consumption of propane was not apparent until env425 was added lippincott et al 2015 nevertheless indigenous propanotrophs may have contributed or even exceeded the activity of env425 propane monooxygenase did not increase appreciably after injection of env425 lippincott et al 2015 a more detailed assessment of the bioaugmented and indigenous propanotrophs is needed to better characterize the contribution of each to biodegradation of 1 4 dioxane three of the parameters evaluated had a significant impact on the time to achieve the remediation goal via cometabolism the maximum specific rate for cometabolic biodegradation of 1 4 dioxane q cmax the dispersion rate for 1 4 dioxane d h w c and the effective porosity ε when the laboratory determined value of q cmax was used 1 4 dioxane was consumed at too high a rate compared to the observed field data fig s6 this parameter was adjusted to 50 of its experimental value to improve the model fit lowering q cmax to 10 of the experimental value increased the time to achieve 1 μg l 1 from 3 5 to 6 7 years however the impact on the percentage of 1 4 dioxane that was biodegraded within 10 years was low although it took three years longer to reach 1 μg l 1 when q cmax was decreased to 10 of the experimentally determined value the need to reduce q cmax compared to the value measured in the laboratory may be attributable to the presence of co contaminants along with 1 4 dioxane at vafb chlorinated aliphatic compounds are inhibitory to aerobic biodegradation of 1 4 dioxane mahendra et al 2013 yet their effect was omitted in the kinetic model used in this study the reduction in q cmax incorporates this inhibitory effect which was further revealed by the sensitivity analysis fig s6 the adjustment to q cmax slowed the rate of biodegradation nevertheless given enough time the majority of the 1 4 dioxane mass was still degraded because there was enough biomass growth due to the continuous supply of propane in the case of the cb1190 the equivalent parameter adjusted was the maximum specific rate for biodegradation of 1 4 dioxane q smax this rate affected biomass growth strongly and had a compounding effect on 1 4 dioxane biodegradation because growth of cb1190 depended only on the concentrations of 1 4 dioxane and oxygen as opposed to the cometabolic case in which biomass growth was largely independent of 1 4 dioxane the dispersion rate for 1 4 dioxane d h w c had a significant impact on the remediation time for cometabolism fig s7 for a d h w c value of 5 10 8 to 1 10 7 m2 s 1 the remediation goal of 1 μg l 1 was not achieved within 10 years for low values 1 10 9 to 1 10 8 m2 s 1 the difference in time to achieve the remediation goal was 0 9 years for a value of 1 10 6 m2 s 1 the average concentration dropped below 1 μg l 1 after 5 3 years and the percentage of biodegradation increased to 100 changes in ε strongly affected the time to achieve the remediation goal via cometabolism for a value of 0 1 the remediation time was 1 6 years whereas for a value of 0 5 the time was 7 0 years fig s8 since the mass of 1 4 dioxane present for a given plume concentration depends on the pore space volume there is more mass of contaminant when ε is larger and therefore it takes longer to biodegrade it sensitivity results for the other parameters evaluated are presented in barajas rodríguez 2016 3 3 simulations for in situ bioremediation using the calibrated model simulations were performed for in situ biodegradation of 1 4 dioxane by metabolism and cometabolism the performance of cb1190 was strongly influenced by the initial 1 4 dioxane concentration fig 4 at a contaminant concentration of 0 1 mg l 1 the remediation goal was achieved after two years and the percentage of biodegradation after 10 years was 92 as the initial concentration of 1 4 dioxane increased the percentage of biodegradation approached 100 however for initial concentrations between 0 5 and 7 5 mg l 1 the time to 1 μg l 1 exceeded 40 years when the initial concentration increased to 10 mg l 1 the time to reach the remediation goal abruptly decreased to 1 8 years the larger mass of 1 4 dioxane available made it possible to sustain growth of cb1190 simulations with the propanotrophic culture env425 were performed with a constant input of propane at the same rate used in the field study as well as an input rate that varied proportionally to the initial concentration of 1 4 dioxane env425 performed better than cb1190 when the initial 1 4 dioxane concentration was less than or equal to 7 5 mg l 1 fig 4 env425 was able to degrade close to 100 of the contaminant after 10 years except when the initial concentration of 1 4 dioxane was 100 mg l 1 at initial 1 4 dioxane concentrations of 7 5 mg l 1 and lower the time to reach 1 μg l 1 ranged from 1 4 to 13 years env425 outperformed cb1190 for low concentrations of 1 4 dioxane because cb1190 did not have enough carbon and energy to grow as fast as the propanotrophs the propane addition rate only had an impact on the remediation time at initial 1 4 dioxane levels of 10 mg l 1 and above when a constant rate became insufficient to sustain a high enough rate of cometabolism at levels equal to and above 10 mg l 1 the performance of cb1190 was superior since more carbon and energy were available to grow and thus achieve high enough biodegradation rates to offset the impact of biomass decay the effect of the biomass injection rate on the performance of metabolic and cometabolic biodegradation of 1 4 dioxane was evaluated fig 5 with all other conditions unchanged from the baseline the extent of biodegradation improved from 77 to 99 as the injection rate of cb1190 increased fig 5a the impact on the time to reach 1 μg l 1 of 1 4 dioxane was much less gradual the time to reach a goal of 1 μg l 1 of 1 4 dioxane was only below 40 years at the highest injection rate 8 4 10 5 kg cod m 2 s 1 fig 5b there was no significant effect of the biomass injection rate on the percentage of contaminant biodegraded after 10 years fig 5a for env425 which remained close to 100 in addition the effect on the time to reach 1 μg l 1 was moderate with remediation times ranging from 3 6 and 4 9 years fig 5b cometabolic biomass growth and performance was more strongly dependent on the amount of propane available which was constant the metabolic bacteria were highly affected by the biomass injection rate because of the low concentration 1 4 dioxane used in these simulations i e 1 mg l 1 the effect of the propane injection rate was evaluated on the performance of env425 injection rates were varied by several orders of magnitude relative to baseline conditions fig 6 from 3 54 10 7 to 3 54 10 4 kg cod m 2 s 1 the percentage of 1 4 dioxane biodegradation was strongly affected only when the propane injection rate decreased below 1 77 10 5 kg cod m 2 s 1 with only 57 removal at the lowest injection rate fig 6a a similar effect was observed on the time to reach 1 μg l 1 of 1 4 dioxane below an injection rate of 2 48 10 5 kg cod m 2 s 1 the remediation goal was not achieved within 40 years fig 6b at higher propane injection rates the time to reach 1 μg l 1 decreased noticeably and then leveled off at 2 2 years the percentage of 1 4 dioxane biodegradation by cb1190 after 10 years decreased from a baseline of 95 to 57 when the oxygen injection rate decreased from 2 02 10 3 kg cod m 2 s 1 to 5 05 10 6 kg cod m 2 s 1 no biodegradation occurred at the lowest injection rate of 2 02 10 6 kg cod m 2 s 1 fig 7a env425 was not affected as significantly the percentage of biodegradation was above 96 at an oxygen injection rate of 5 05 10 6 kg cod m 2 s 1 and then decreased to 51 when the rate was 2 02 10 6 kg cod m 2 s 1 cb1190 did not reach the remediation goal within 40 years for any of the oxygen rates evaluated this was expected since the target was not reached at the highest injection rate evaluated which was also the baseline value the effect on env425 was more evident the time to reach the remediation goal decreased from above 40 years for the lowest rate down to 17 5 years for an injection rate of 5 05 10 6 kg cod m 2 s 1 then leveled off as the injection rate increased to 1 01 10 5 kg cod m 2 s 1 and above fig 7b the results indicate that the pilot study at vafb was performed at an adequate oxygen injection rate these results are also consistent with the lower oxygen half saturation constant for env425 versus cb1190 found in laboratory experiments barajas rodríguez and freedman 2018 and the fact that env425 does not have a minimum oxygen concentration for 1 4 dioxane biodegradation since the propanotrophic culture has a higher affinity for oxygen it was less impacted at lower concentrations 4 conclusions a steady state air sparging flow model was successfully coupled to a contaminant transport model that includes monod kinetics for 1 4 dioxane biodegradation by metabolic and cometabolic processes the air sparging model was able to predict the flows of gas and water by simulating relative permeabilities and gas and water saturations in response to an injection pressure gas flow in the aquifer achieved a steady state that reasonably predicted the gas flow at the vafb site simulation results from the air sparging model were used as initial conditions for the contaminant transport model we acknowledge there are limitations to the air spring model with respect to the spatial distribution of gases johnson et al 2001 as discussed in section 2 1 the coupled models were calibrated using the monitoring data from vafb for 1 4 dioxane the model predicted the correct trend for propane distribution but predicted a slower rate of propane consumption than what was observed in the field trial the reason for a slower rate of propane consumption is not yet known but may be related to the difficulty of accurately sampling dissolved gases consumption of propane by indigenous propanotrophs losses via wells as conduits or heterogeneities in aquifer lithology that are not necessarily captured by the simple layered model but may influence groundwater concentrations in a well sample screened over multiple feet the model predicted the decrease in 1 4 dioxane concentration in the two closest monitoring wells however the model was less accurate for predicting 1 4 dioxane in the two monitoring wells furthest from the source zone one of these wells showed no biodegradation while the other one started biodegradation 150 days earlier than what the model predicted the model predicted a trend between these extremes the different behaviors in those wells may have been a consequence of preferential flow paths created during air sparging and aquifer heterogeneities as noted above well 5b was a previously installed broadly screened well that appeared to cross multiple aquifer units and was not well connected to the propane sparge well limitations associated with data from monitoring wells in gas sparging systems have been described johnson et al 2001 a sensitivity analysis of several parameters used in the model showed that the biomass decay rate had a significant impact on bioremediation outcomes with respect to both the percentage of biodegradation after 10 years and the time to achieve an average 1 4 dioxane concentration of 1 μg l 1 the effect was largest for cb1190 such that for most of the simulations a remediation goal of 1 μg l 1 was not achieved even after 40 years the biomass dispersion coefficient in the water phase also had a significant impact on the performance of both cultures with env425 the closer the spread of biomass to that of oxygen and propane the shorter the remediation time for cb1190 shorter remediation times occurred when the biomass was distributed closest to the 1 4 dioxane the maximum specific 1 4 dioxane biodegradation rate also had a significant effect on the time to reach 1 μg l 1 and a somewhat lesser impact on the percentage of 1 4 dioxane consumed other parameters that had a significant effect were the biomass dispersion rate in water and aquifer porosity dispersion coefficients in the water phase for 1 4 dioxane oxygen and propane had a low impact on bioremediation performance as did the dispersivities for propane and oxygen in the gas phase using the calibrated model simulations were performed to compare the performance of cb1190 to env425 varying the initial concentration of the 1 4 dioxane plume indicated that cb1190 outperformed env425 at levels greater than or equal to 10 mg l 1 on the other hand env425 was more effective at 1 4 dioxane concentrations below 10 mg l 1 for concentrations below 0 25 mg l 1 the viability of cb1190 improved although env425 still required shorter remediation times biomass injection rates had a strong effect on the metabolism of 1 4 dioxane in terms of the percent biodegradation achieved after 10 years cometabolic biodegradation was not affected by the biomass injection rate because continuous addition of propane allowed for growth throughout the treatment zone oxygen injection rates had a more significant effect on the performance of cb1190 than env25 however both cultures were negatively affected by the lowest oxygen injection rate evaluated cometabolic biodegradation of 1 4 dioxane was reduced when the propane injection rate was reduced several fold below the baseline level when adequate propane was provided remediation times improved and further increases to the propane injection rate became unnecessary these results indicated there is an optimum rate of propane injection to achieve bioremediation of 1 4 dioxane the simulations suggested that propane was added in excess during the vafb pilot study the model developed for this study represents a novel tool for assessing the performance of metabolic and cometabolic bacteria for in situ bioremediation of 1 4 dioxane the effectiveness of each bioremediation strategy depends strongly on aquifer permeability dispersion groundwater mixing biomass movement biomass decay competitive inhibition the initial concentration of 1 4 dioxane and biomass and oxygen and propane injection rates the results from this study indicate that gas sparging with air and propane coupled to bioaugmentation with a propanotrophic culture will achieve a faster rate of remediation than air sparging and bioaugmentation with a culture that metabolically biodegrades 1 4 dioxane as long as the initial concentration of 1 4 dioxane is less than approximately 7 5 to 10 mg l 1 that is the case for the majority of 1 4 dioxane plumes that have been characterized thus far the results of this study can be broadened by evaluating other bacteria that degrade 1 4 dioxane the number of microbes known to biodegrade 1 4 dioxane continues to expand including acinetobacter baumanii strain dd1 huang et al 2014 mycobacterium dioxanotrophicus ph 06 kim et al 2009 and rhodanobacter ays5 pugazhendi et al 2015 microbes known to cometabolize 1 4 dioxane also continue to increase including azoarcus sp dd4 which is also able to cometabolize 1 1 dichloroethene deng et al 2018 some of these newly identified microbes may be more competitive than cb1190 and env425 due to their higher affinity for 1 4 dioxane higher yield and greater resistance to inhibition by chlorinated solvents deng et al 2018 therefore applying the systematic approach employed in the present study would be beneficial to elucidate the preferred microorganisms for

1584,bioaugmentation is an option for aerobic remediation of groundwater contaminated with 1 4 dioxane one approach uses microbes that cometabolize 1 4 dioxane following growth on a primary substrate e g propane whereas another uses microbes e g pseudonocardia dioxivorans cb1190 capable of using 1 4 dioxane as a sole substrate the relative merits of these approaches are difficult to distinguish based on field data alone and theoretical analyses of these processes have yet to be published the objective of this study was to compare these remediation options using a transport model that incorporates advection dispersion and biodegradation reactions described by multi substrate monod kinetics and co inhibition effects the transport model was coupled to an approximate steady state air sparging simulation used to estimate gas propane and oxygen distribution at the field scale the model was calibrated with field data for 1 4 dioxane and propane concentrations from a previously reported pilot study the two remediation approaches were evaluated under different conditions that vary the initial concentration of 1 4 dioxane and the loading rates of oxygen propane and biomass the metrics used to evaluate the remediation success were the time to reach an average 1 4 dioxane concentration of 1 μg l 1 and the percent of 1 4 dioxane biodegraded after 10 years of simulation results indicate that the initial concentration of 1 4 dioxane strongly influences which remediation approach is more effective when initial concentrations were 10 mg l 1 propane driven cometabolism led to faster remediation whereas metabolic biodegradation was faster when initial concentrations were 10 mg l 1 or higher below 0 25 mg l 1 the viability of metabolic biodegradation improved although cometabolism by propanotrophs still required less time to reach 1 μg l 1 biomass injection rates had a strong effect on the rate of metabolism but not cometabolism because continuous input of primary substrate supported growth of propanotrophs the performance of both cultures was negatively affected by a decrease in oxygen injection rate the endogenous decay coefficient and the dispersion rate for biomass had a significant impact on cometabolic and metabolic biodegradation of 1 4 dioxane the maximum specific rate for cometabolism of 1 4 dioxane the dispersion rate for 1 4 dioxane and effective porosity also had significant effects on the time to achieve remediation with propanotrophs keywords 1 4 dioxane biodegradation biosparging bioaugmentation contaminant transport model 1 introduction 1 4 dioxane has become a priority for remediation due to its status as a probable human carcinogen and its presence at numerous contaminated sites across the united states adamson et al 2014 in situ biodegradation of 1 4 dioxane is an alternative to energy intensive physicochemical techniques laboratory studies have shown aerobic biodegradation can be achieved by metabolic and cometabolic microbes mahendra and alvarez cohen 2006 sei et al 2013 zenker et al 2002 since several key genes required for aerobic metabolism of 1 4 dioxane are carried on plasmids grostern et al 2012 there is reason to expect that horizontal gene transfer has distributed degradation capabilities across many different microbes the number of isolates identified from environmental media with the ability to biodegrade this compound continues to increase he et al 2017 sei et al 2013 cometabolism of contaminants such as chlorinated aliphatics and methyl tert butyl ether has been demonstrated in field applications where methane or propane served as the primary growth substrate delivered via air sparging gelhar et al 2010 steffan et al 1997 cometabolism of 1 4 dioxane has also been performed at the pilot scale by air sparging with propane as the primary substrate and bioaugmentation with the propanotroph rhodococcus ruber env425 at vandenberg air force base vafb lippincott et al 2015 metabolic biodegradation of 1 4 dioxane has many potential advantages compared to cometabolism with metabolism there is no need to amend the groundwater with a primary substrate the oxygen demand is considerably lower and there is less chance of clogging an aquifer due to excessive growth nevertheless there are also challenges in dilute plumes the concentration of 1 4 dioxane may be too low to support biodegradation as a sole substrate as a result the kinetics of biodegradation may be slow when the concentration of 1 4 dioxane is low barajas rodríguez and freedman 2018 compared the rates of 1 4 dioxane biodegradation under metabolic and cometabolic conditions using kinetic constants for pseudonocardia dioxanivorans cb1190 and a mixed consortium of propanotrophs env487 batch simulations indicated that propanotrophs decreased 1 4 dioxane from 1000 to 1 μg l 1 in less time than cb1190 when the initial biomass concentration was 0 74 mg on an electron equivalents basis per liter whereas metabolic biodegradation was favored at higher initial biomass concentrations and higher initial 1 4 dioxane concentrations however this comparison was limited to suspended growth conditions so the effects under field conditions remain unclear these effects could be evaluated by incorporating the kinetic model from the laboratory in a subsurface transport model that includes effects of in situ conditions biodegradation models that include multiple biodegradation pathways and substrates such as biorxntrn wang and papenguth 2001 biomoc essaid and bekins 1997 min3p mayer et al 2001 and miser chen et al 2013 have been applied to simulate mass transport and biodegradation of contaminants biomoc allows for multiple chemical compounds with a monod model for biodegradation and includes noncompetitive competitive and biomass inhibition factors min3p is capable of simulating multiple substrates terminal electron acceptors and inhibitors miser has been used to simulate biodegradation of chlorinated solvents by two microbial populations with lactate serving as the electron donor as well as inhibition and capabilities for multiple chemical compounds in situ cometabolism of chlorinated aliphatics has been simulated using monod kinetics for methane oxidizing bacteria semprini and mccarty 1991 semprini and mccarty 1992 nevertheless models that simulate metabolism and cometabolism of 1 4 dioxane in an aquifer in response to biosparging and bioaugmentation are currently unavailable this shortcoming is limiting the ability to evaluate factors affecting the performance of 1 4 dioxane bioremediation the purpose of this study is to overcome this limitation we do this by describing an analysis of biosparging and bioaugmentation that includes biodegradation reactions and then we compared the results to observations at a field site 2 materials and methods this paper uses a theoretical analysis to evaluate bioremediation of 1 4 dioxane the analysis is developed by first describing concepts that lead to an overview of the theoretical model governing equations and boundary conditions are then identified and we outline the method for implementing solution of the equations 2 1 conceptual model the model simulations performed in this study were used to compare the performance of metabolic and cometabolic bacteria under equivalent environmental conditions while incorporating differences in their kinetic characteristics barajas rodríguez and freedman 2018 field data from vafb were used to develop the geometry and parameters for the model lippincott et al 2015 at vafb an injection well was installed to deliver air and propane into a confined aquifer contaminated with 1 4 dioxane four monitoring wells were placed near the injection well and within the 1 4 dioxane plume the aquifer unit consists of well graded sand with gravel and zones of silty fine sand the aquifer is approximately 1 4 m thick and the porosity is assumed to be 0 3 the upper confining layer consists of low permeability silts and silty sandy clays whereas the underlying layer is mostly lean clay lippincott et al 2015 air entered at the injection well and traveled away from it the flow was driven by the injection gas pressure the buoyancy of the gas and upward gas leakage through fractures and discontinuities in the confining layer during the pilot scale study at vafb air was injected once per day for 45 min at 10 ft3 min 1 during the first 28 days propane injections began on day 29 once per day on day 37 air and propane were injected in six cycles per day with air added for 6 min and propane for 30 during each cycle presumably the gas saturations increased sharply and displaced water during the 45 min of injection and then gas saturation dropped as water refilled some pores during the 23 25 h between injections the mass of injected gas would occupy approximately 5586 m3 at the pressure of the aquifer and this would displace a significant fraction of the pore volume of water within a region 36 m from the injection well this level of gas saturation was not observed which indicates that some of the injected gas leaked upward through the confining layer propane was detected in some monitoring wells lippincott personal communication so the monitoring wells were responsible for some of the gas leakage it seems likely that gas also leaked upward through relatively high permeability zones in the confining unit gas flow rates and gas saturations were expected to vary rapidly due to the brief high rate injection periods and the spatial distribution of gas was expected to be complex due to leakage through the confining unit in areas that were unknown to us fig s1 this high spatial and temporal variability in the gas saturation was impossible to simulate in detail given the available data early simulations evaluated individual gas injection cycles and while this is possible the required time steps are small and the simulations are excessively long as a result we assumed that sparging delivery of oxygen and propane could be represented using a steady mass injection rate that was equal to the average rate in the field moreover we assumed that gas leakage through the confining layer occurred at a rate that was proportional to the gas pressure but this proportionality was uniformly distributed the sparging process was responsible for the introduction and transport of oxygen and propane and the metabolism of microbes was responsible for consumption of oxygen and propane and cometabolism of 1 4 dioxane 2 2 theoretical model the model concepts were simulated using a 2d plan view geometry in cartesian coordinates a circular region with a 30 m diameter was used to define a 1 4 dioxane plume similar to the one described in the pilot study at vafb an injection well was located at the center of the domain fig 1 air sparging conditions in the pilot study were approximated by dividing the aquifer thickness into five uniform layers at different depths the average capillary pressure in each layer was calculated fig s 1 and used to determine the relative permeabilities and the phase saturations of the fluids therefore this model includes the vertical variation in saturation and flow rate that would occur during sparging but the simplified approach avoids explicitly calculating flow in the vertical direction another assumption was that the air sparging process was at steady state this is based on the arguments outlined above and ignoring temporal variations during air sparging which is consistent with lundergard and andersen 1993 it seems likely that the large fluctuations in flow during sparging could cause significant mixing in the vertical direction vertical mixing of biomass in the water phase was represented by including an effective dispersion parameter that was estimated using field data the gas and water saturations and the relative permeability were related to air and water pressures using the brooks and corey equations brooks and corey 1964 under the assumptions discussed in the conceptual model section the reactive transport model for cometabolism predicted concentrations in the water phase for 1 4 dioxane c dissolved propane s dissolved oxygen o and biomass x for the metabolic simulations propane was omitted and 1 4 dioxane served as the growth substrate s only propane s gas and oxygen o gas were predicted for the gas phase the model was calibrated with monitoring data from the vafb pilot study the plume of 1 4 dioxane was characterized by three uniform concentration zones of 1100 550 and 100 μg l 1 fig 1 oxygen and propane entered at the injection well in the gas phase and their mass transfer rates into the water phase was controlled by their solubility and a global mass transfer coefficient adsorption and volatilization were ignored because the distribution coefficient and henry s law coefficient for 1 4 dioxane are relatively low biomass transport was assumed to occur by advection and dispersion in the water phase dispersion was assumed to occur due to vertical and horizontal mixing caused by the sparging process 2 3

coinhibition between substrate and non growth substrate captured in the coefficient k is were used for cometabolism of 1 4 dioxane as described previously barajas rodríguez and freedman 2018 the kinetic parameters adjusted for a temperature of 15 c are summarized in table s1 2 5 boundary and initial conditions the initial gas pressure was set equal to the hydrostatic pressure allowing a smooth start of the numerical simulations the initial concentrations of propane and oxygen in the gas phase were zero the initial concentrations of propane oxygen and biomass in the water phase were zero the initial 1 4 dioxane concentration consisted of three concentration zones of 1100 550 and 100 μg l 1 located at the same position as described in the vafb pilot study fig 1 boundary conditions for the model are summarized in table 1 the hydrostatic water pressure was set to 45 000 pa based on the hydrogeologic description from the vafb pilot study lippincott et al 2015 for the gas phase an injection pressure of 52 000 pa was specified at the injection well for the first 29 days when only oxygen was added this pressure was specified to be consistent with the amount of air delivered in the pilot study between days 29 and 37 oxygen and propane were added at the same injection pressure after day 37 the pressure was increased to 59 000 pa this increase was made to be consistent with the increase in the air sparging injection cycles used in the vafb pilot study the outer boundary of the model was open flow to allow gas water and species to move away from the model domain fig 1 five different hydrostatic pressures were located at each of the five depths fig s1 table 1 the fluxes for propane in the gas phase n g s were 1 01 10 5 kg chemical oxygen demand cod m 2 s 1 between days 29 and 37 and 8 09 10 5 kg cod m 2 s 1 from day 37 the fluxes for oxygen in the gas phase n g o were 5 34 10 3 kg cod m 2 s 1 during the first 37 days and 2 56 10 2 kg cod m 2 s 1 from day 37 the flux for added biomass in the groundwater n w x was 1 68 10 5 kg cod m 2 s 1 between day 41 and day 42 table 1 biomass addition was simulated as an injection spread over one 24 h period while a shorter length of time is typically used to achieve bioaugmentation in the field periods 24 h led to computational instability with the model 2 6 model implementation comsol version 5 2 was used to implement the model calibration and to perform the analysis to assess the effect of different parameters on the time to achieve a bioremediation goal calibration of the model to the data observed in the field demonstration at vafb was used as a baseline scenario one of the reasons for using comsol is its ability to incorporate the complex biodegradation kinetics and to readily couple a gas and water flow model the parameters considered for calibrating the model are shown in table 2 of these six were adjusted so that the model adequately predicted the 1 4 dioxane concentrations observed in the field at four monitoring wells there was no data available for the gas distribution from the pilot study therefore the flow was calibrated to match the aqueous propane distribution observed in the field lippincott et al 2015 each parameter was adjusted by using the parametric sweep tool in comsol a fluid dynamics triangular meshing of the domain was customized in order to refine the grid in the 1 4 dioxane plume fig s2 the mesh was refined as a boundary mesh for the domain containing the injection well this was done to have a smooth mesh element size transition from the well boundary to the rest of the domain the rest of the mesh was set as free triangular further information on the calibration process and numerical implementation is presented by barajas rodríguez 2016 after performing the model calibration and sensitivity analysis of the model parameters the performance of cb1190 metabolizes 1 4 dioxane and the propanotroph env425 cometabolizes 1 4 dioxane was compared variations in the initial 1 4 dioxane concentrations and propane oxygen and biomass input fluxes were performed to evaluate their effect on bioremediation the same metrics used in the sensitivity analysis were followed i e the time to achieve an average 1 4 dioxane concentration of 1 μg l 1 and percentage of contaminant degraded after 10 years this comparison was the main outcome of the present study 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration for cometabolic bioremediation the parameters in table 1 were adjusted to achieve a mass flux of air of 6 44 10 4 m s 1 into the aquifer at the injection well boundary corresponding to the gas flux used in the vafb pilot study distributions of the gas relative permeability k rg effective gas porosity ε g and gas velocity u g in the aquifer were also obtained fig s3 the model closely followed the rise in propane concentrations after its addition on day 29 fig 2 the predicted propane concentration reached approximately 250 and 210 μg l 1 for wells 47b and 2b which are located closest to the injection well fig 1 however the highest measured concentration was 110 μg l 1 a similar pattern was observed for the distant wells in which the predicted peak concentration of propane was 95 and 130 μg l 1 and the measured peak concentrations were 65 and 75 μg l 1 respectively the model also predicted the consumption of propane following the addition of biomass on day 42 however the decrease in propane concentration is slower for the simulation since it took between 300 and 400 d to reach zero whereas the field data had a faster decrease and reached the detection limit in 50 days the more rapid decreases in propane observed in the field may be a consequence of the difficulty in measuring low concentrations of dissolved gases in situ consumption of propane by indigenous propanotrophs losses via wells as conduits or heterogeneities in aquifer lithology that are not necessarily captured by the simple layered model but may influence groundwater concentrations in a well sample screened over multiple feet the model fits the 1 4 dioxane field data from the monitoring wells near the injection well better than for the more distant wells fig 3 according to the field data biodegradation of 1 4 dioxane was similar in the two monitoring wells located near the injection well i e 47b and 2b 1 4 dioxane concentrations decreased at approximately the same time in both of these wells falling below 2 μg l 1 after 210 days this was not the case for the more distant monitoring wells 5b and 34b even though those wells were at similar distances from the injection well they were located in opposite directions fig 1 monitoring well 5b did not show any significant decrease in 1 4 dioxane during biosparging however well 34b showed a decrease in concentration from 136 to 8 9 μg l 1 in only 61 days it should be noted that well 5b was a previously installed broadly screened well that appeared to cross multiple aquifer units and was not well connected to the propane sparge well discrepancies between the model prediction for 1 4 dioxane in the distant wells 5b and 34b with respect to the field data measurements may be attributable to heterogeneities in the aquifer that provide more open channels for propane and biomass to move towards 34b similarly heterogeneities such as clay lenses may be blocking the flow of propane towards mw 5b thus preventing biomass growth the model assumes that the porous medium between the injection well and the monitoring wells is homogeneous therefore the biodegradation prediction is an intermediate case for the observed concentrations in both distant wells fitting of the 1 4 dioxane data from the pilot study was the primary criterion for adjusting the transport and kinetic parameters for model calibration after an adequate trend on propane concentration rise and decrease was predicted by the model parameters such as d h w x d h w c d h w o b and the maximum specific rate for cometabolic biodegradation of 1 4 dioxane q cmax were adjusted the total sums of squared errors for the four wells was 4 6 10 6 kg cod m 3 2 however it is important to look at the sums of squared errors from each well since the initial concentrations varied among them well 5b had an initial 1 4 dioxane concentration of 555 μg l 1 1 10 3 kg cod m 3 and well 34b started at 135 μg l 1 2 4 10 4 kg cod m 3 the closest wells 47b and 2b had initial concentrations of 1090 μg l 1 2 10 3 kg cod m 3 and 997 μg l 1 1 8 10 3 kg cod m 3 respectively the sum of squared errors was 8 2 10 8 kg cod m 3 2 for well 34b and 3 04 10 6 kg cod m 3 2 for 5b even though the initial concentration of well 5b is five times higher than 34b its sum of squared errors is four orders of magnitude higher in order to decide on the most adequate model fit attention was paid mostly to wells 47b and 2b which are in the highest 1 4 dioxane concentration zone the sums of squared errors for wells 47b and 2b were 2 7 10 7 kg cod m 3 2 and 1 41 10 6 kg cod m 3 2 respectively considering only wells 47b and 2b the sum of squared errors calculated was 1 65 10 6 kg cod m 3 2 for the calibrated parameters 3 2 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was performed for 11 parameters to investigate their effects on 1 4 dioxane biodegradation the simulation time was extended to 10 years in order to capture long term trends a summary of the results is shown in table 3 in terms of the percentage of 1 4 dioxane biodegraded and the time to reach a remediation goal of 1 μg l 1 the impacts were rated as significant 30 from the base case moderately significant 5 to 30 change relative to the base case a low level of significance 5 change relative to the base case or no impact on the outcome the two parameters that had a significant impact on cometabolic and metabolic biodegradation of 1 4 dioxane were the endogenous decay coefficient b and the dispersion rate of biomass d h w x the sensitivity of b based on the percentage of 1 4 dioxane degraded was significant for cometabolic and metabolic conditions fig s4a and was significant based on the time to reach the remediation goal for cometabolic conditions fig s4b when b was set above 25 of the experimentally determined value the average 1 4 dioxane concentration decreased at a slower rate the concentration of 1 4 dioxane did not reach 1 μg l 1 even after 10 years a concentration of 1 μg l 1 was only reached when b was between 0 and 10 of the laboratory determined value the percentage of 1 4 dioxane that was biodegraded after 10 years decreased to 20 when b was set to the experimentally determined value revealing its highly significant long term impact biological kinetic parameters can vary widely under in situ conditions chambon julie et al 2012 kovárová kovar and egli 1998 and changes in the physiological state of biomass under such conditions suggest that lower decay rates may occur when the primary growth substrate is available at low concentrations lobos et al 2005 perez padilla and grady jr 1998 the sensitivity of the biomass dispersion coefficient in water d h w x based on the percentage of 1 4 dioxane degraded and the time to reach the remediation goal was significant for cometabolic and metabolic conditions fig s5 d h w x was varied over several orders of magnitude and had a negative effect on the percentage of 1 4 dioxane biodegraded when its value was below 1 10 8 m2 s 1 the faster the biomass moved away from the injection well the easier it was for biomass to catch up with the propane and oxygen and thus achieve higher growth rates for the lowest value tested 1 10 9 m2 s 1 there was no biodegradation of 1 4 dioxane a considerable difference in remediation times was observed between 1 10 8 m2 s 1 which required 40 years and 5 10 8 m2 s 1 which achieved the remediation goal in 4 0 years when dispersion was higher than 1 10 6 m2 s 1 complete biodegradation was still achieved after 10 years the trend for cb1190 was similar with decreasing remediation times as dispersion of biomass increased since higher biomass dispersion allowed bacteria to reach the 1 4 dioxane faster biomass growth was promoted earlier and the remediation time was reduced however when d h w x was too high the biomass moved past the substrate and resulted in poor performance it is important to note that biomass movement was approximated in this study by adjusting the dispersion coefficient in the water phase it would be more accurate to model biomass movement as a function of the groundwater velocity as well as the properties of the bacterial cells that impact transport e g straining settling attachment and detachment this would require that special attention be given to the groundwater flow conditions generated during biosparging and to the regional groundwater flow as well as the type of culture injected it is also noteworthy that the model does not take into account the possibility that indigenous propanotrophs contributed to 1 4 dioxane biodegradation during the vafb field trial even though propanotrophs are widely distributed e g chu et al 2018 tupa and masuda 2018 consumption of propane was not apparent until env425 was added lippincott et al 2015 nevertheless indigenous propanotrophs may have contributed or even exceeded the activity of env425 propane monooxygenase did not increase appreciably after injection of env425 lippincott et al 2015 a more detailed assessment of the bioaugmented and indigenous propanotrophs is needed to better characterize the contribution of each to biodegradation of 1 4 dioxane three of the parameters evaluated had a significant impact on the time to achieve the remediation goal via cometabolism the maximum specific rate for cometabolic biodegradation of 1 4 dioxane q cmax the dispersion rate for 1 4 dioxane d h w c and the effective porosity ε when the laboratory determined value of q cmax was used 1 4 dioxane was consumed at too high a rate compared to the observed field data fig s6 this parameter was adjusted to 50 of its experimental value to improve the model fit lowering q cmax to 10 of the experimental value increased the time to achieve 1 μg l 1 from 3 5 to 6 7 years however the impact on the percentage of 1 4 dioxane that was biodegraded within 10 years was low although it took three years longer to reach 1 μg l 1 when q cmax was decreased to 10 of the experimentally determined value the need to reduce q cmax compared to the value measured in the laboratory may be attributable to the presence of co contaminants along with 1 4 dioxane at vafb chlorinated aliphatic compounds are inhibitory to aerobic biodegradation of 1 4 dioxane mahendra et al 2013 yet their effect was omitted in the kinetic model used in this study the reduction in q cmax incorporates this inhibitory effect which was further revealed by the sensitivity analysis fig s6 the adjustment to q cmax slowed the rate of biodegradation nevertheless given enough time the majority of the 1 4 dioxane mass was still degraded because there was enough biomass growth due to the continuous supply of propane in the case of the cb1190 the equivalent parameter adjusted was the maximum specific rate for biodegradation of 1 4 dioxane q smax this rate affected biomass growth strongly and had a compounding effect on 1 4 dioxane biodegradation because growth of cb1190 depended only on the concentrations of 1 4 dioxane and oxygen as opposed to the cometabolic case in which biomass growth was largely independent of 1 4 dioxane the dispersion rate for 1 4 dioxane d h w c had a significant impact on the remediation time for cometabolism fig s7 for a d h w c value of 5 10 8 to 1 10 7 m2 s 1 the remediation goal of 1 μg l 1 was not achieved within 10 years for low values 1 10 9 to 1 10 8 m2 s 1 the difference in time to achieve the remediation goal was 0 9 years for a value of 1 10 6 m2 s 1 the average concentration dropped below 1 μg l 1 after 5 3 years and the percentage of biodegradation increased to 100 changes in ε strongly affected the time to achieve the remediation goal via cometabolism for a value of 0 1 the remediation time was 1 6 years whereas for a value of 0 5 the time was 7 0 years fig s8 since the mass of 1 4 dioxane present for a given plume concentration depends on the pore space volume there is more mass of contaminant when ε is larger and therefore it takes longer to biodegrade it sensitivity results for the other parameters evaluated are presented in barajas rodríguez 2016 3 3 simulations for in situ bioremediation using the calibrated model simulations were performed for in situ biodegradation of 1 4 dioxane by metabolism and cometabolism the performance of cb1190 was strongly influenced by the initial 1 4 dioxane concentration fig 4 at a contaminant concentration of 0 1 mg l 1 the remediation goal was achieved after two years and the percentage of biodegradation after 10 years was 92 as the initial concentration of 1 4 dioxane increased the percentage of biodegradation approached 100 however for initial concentrations between 0 5 and 7 5 mg l 1 the time to 1 μg l 1 exceeded 40 years when the initial concentration increased to 10 mg l 1 the time to reach the remediation goal abruptly decreased to 1 8 years the larger mass of 1 4 dioxane available made it possible to sustain growth of cb1190 simulations with the propanotrophic culture env425 were performed with a constant input of propane at the same rate used in the field study as well as an input rate that varied proportionally to the initial concentration of 1 4 dioxane env425 performed better than cb1190 when the initial 1 4 dioxane concentration was less than or equal to 7 5 mg l 1 fig 4 env425 was able to degrade close to 100 of the contaminant after 10 years except when the initial concentration of 1 4 dioxane was 100 mg l 1 at initial 1 4 dioxane concentrations of 7 5 mg l 1 and lower the time to reach 1 μg l 1 ranged from 1 4 to 13 years env425 outperformed cb1190 for low concentrations of 1 4 dioxane because cb1190 did not have enough carbon and energy to grow as fast as the propanotrophs the propane addition rate only had an impact on the remediation time at initial 1 4 dioxane levels of 10 mg l 1 and above when a constant rate became insufficient to sustain a high enough rate of cometabolism at levels equal to and above 10 mg l 1 the performance of cb1190 was superior since more carbon and energy were available to grow and thus achieve high enough biodegradation rates to offset the impact of biomass decay the effect of the biomass injection rate on the performance of metabolic and cometabolic biodegradation of 1 4 dioxane was evaluated fig 5 with all other conditions unchanged from the baseline the extent of biodegradation improved from 77 to 99 as the injection rate of cb1190 increased fig 5a the impact on the time to reach 1 μg l 1 of 1 4 dioxane was much less gradual the time to reach a goal of 1 μg l 1 of 1 4 dioxane was only below 40 years at the highest injection rate 8 4 10 5 kg cod m 2 s 1 fig 5b there was no significant effect of the biomass injection rate on the percentage of contaminant biodegraded after 10 years fig 5a for env425 which remained close to 100 in addition the effect on the time to reach 1 μg l 1 was moderate with remediation times ranging from 3 6 and 4 9 years fig 5b cometabolic biomass growth and performance was more strongly dependent on the amount of propane available which was constant the metabolic bacteria were highly affected by the biomass injection rate because of the low concentration 1 4 dioxane used in these simulations i e 1 mg l 1 the effect of the propane injection rate was evaluated on the performance of env425 injection rates were varied by several orders of magnitude relative to baseline conditions fig 6 from 3 54 10 7 to 3 54 10 4 kg cod m 2 s 1 the percentage of 1 4 dioxane biodegradation was strongly affected only when the propane injection rate decreased below 1 77 10 5 kg cod m 2 s 1 with only 57 removal at the lowest injection rate fig 6a a similar effect was observed on the time to reach 1 μg l 1 of 1 4 dioxane below an injection rate of 2 48 10 5 kg cod m 2 s 1 the remediation goal was not achieved within 40 years fig 6b at higher propane injection rates the time to reach 1 μg l 1 decreased noticeably and then leveled off at 2 2 years the percentage of 1 4 dioxane biodegradation by cb1190 after 10 years decreased from a baseline of 95 to 57 when the oxygen injection rate decreased from 2 02 10 3 kg cod m 2 s 1 to 5 05 10 6 kg cod m 2 s 1 no biodegradation occurred at the lowest injection rate of 2 02 10 6 kg cod m 2 s 1 fig 7a env425 was not affected as significantly the percentage of biodegradation was above 96 at an oxygen injection rate of 5 05 10 6 kg cod m 2 s 1 and then decreased to 51 when the rate was 2 02 10 6 kg cod m 2 s 1 cb1190 did not reach the remediation goal within 40 years for any of the oxygen rates evaluated this was expected since the target was not reached at the highest injection rate evaluated which was also the baseline value the effect on env425 was more evident the time to reach the remediation goal decreased from above 40 years for the lowest rate down to 17 5 years for an injection rate of 5 05 10 6 kg cod m 2 s 1 then leveled off as the injection rate increased to 1 01 10 5 kg cod m 2 s 1 and above fig 7b the results indicate that the pilot study at vafb was performed at an adequate oxygen injection rate these results are also consistent with the lower oxygen half saturation constant for env425 versus cb1190 found in laboratory experiments barajas rodríguez and freedman 2018 and the fact that env425 does not have a minimum oxygen concentration for 1 4 dioxane biodegradation since the propanotrophic culture has a higher affinity for oxygen it was less impacted at lower concentrations 4 conclusions a steady state air sparging flow model was successfully coupled to a contaminant transport model that includes monod kinetics for 1 4 dioxane biodegradation by metabolic and cometabolic processes the air sparging model was able to predict the flows of gas and water by simulating relative permeabilities and gas and water saturations in response to an injection pressure gas flow in the aquifer achieved a steady state that reasonably predicted the gas flow at the vafb site simulation results from the air sparging model were used as initial conditions for the contaminant transport model we acknowledge there are limitations to the air spring model with respect to the spatial distribution of gases johnson et al 2001 as discussed in section 2 1 the coupled models were calibrated using the monitoring data from vafb for 1 4 dioxane the model predicted the correct trend for propane distribution but predicted a slower rate of propane consumption than what was observed in the field trial the reason for a slower rate of propane consumption is not yet known but may be related to the difficulty of accurately sampling dissolved gases consumption of propane by indigenous propanotrophs losses via wells as conduits or heterogeneities in aquifer lithology that are not necessarily captured by the simple layered model but may influence groundwater concentrations in a well sample screened over multiple feet the model predicted the decrease in 1 4 dioxane concentration in the two closest monitoring wells however the model was less accurate for predicting 1 4 dioxane in the two monitoring wells furthest from the source zone one of these wells showed no biodegradation while the other one started biodegradation 150 days earlier than what the model predicted the model predicted a trend between these extremes the different behaviors in those wells may have been a consequence of preferential flow paths created during air sparging and aquifer heterogeneities as noted above well 5b was a previously installed broadly screened well that appeared to cross multiple aquifer units and was not well connected to the propane sparge well limitations associated with data from monitoring wells in gas sparging systems have been described johnson et al 2001 a sensitivity analysis of several parameters used in the model showed that the biomass decay rate had a significant impact on bioremediation outcomes with respect to both the percentage of biodegradation after 10 years and the time to achieve an average 1 4 dioxane concentration of 1 μg l 1 the effect was largest for cb1190 such that for most of the simulations a remediation goal of 1 μg l 1 was not achieved even after 40 years the biomass dispersion coefficient in the water phase also had a significant impact on the performance of both cultures with env425 the closer the spread of biomass to that of oxygen and propane the shorter the remediation time for cb1190 shorter remediation times occurred when the biomass was distributed closest to the 1 4 dioxane the maximum specific 1 4 dioxane biodegradation rate also had a significant effect on the time to reach 1 μg l 1 and a somewhat lesser impact on the percentage of 1 4 dioxane consumed other parameters that had a significant effect were the biomass dispersion rate in water and aquifer porosity dispersion coefficients in the water phase for 1 4 dioxane oxygen and propane had a low impact on bioremediation performance as did the dispersivities for propane and oxygen in the gas phase using the calibrated model simulations were performed to compare the performance of cb1190 to env425 varying the initial concentration of the 1 4 dioxane plume indicated that cb1190 outperformed env425 at levels greater than or equal to 10 mg l 1 on the other hand env425 was more effective at 1 4 dioxane concentrations below 10 mg l 1 for concentrations below 0 25 mg l 1 the viability of cb1190 improved although env425 still required shorter remediation times biomass injection rates had a strong effect on the metabolism of 1 4 dioxane in terms of the percent biodegradation achieved after 10 years cometabolic biodegradation was not affected by the biomass injection rate because continuous addition of propane allowed for growth throughout the treatment zone oxygen injection rates had a more significant effect on the performance of cb1190 than env25 however both cultures were negatively affected by the lowest oxygen injection rate evaluated cometabolic biodegradation of 1 4 dioxane was reduced when the propane injection rate was reduced several fold below the baseline level when adequate propane was provided remediation times improved and further increases to the propane injection rate became unnecessary these results indicated there is an optimum rate of propane injection to achieve bioremediation of 1 4 dioxane the simulations suggested that propane was added in excess during the vafb pilot study the model developed for this study represents a novel tool for assessing the performance of metabolic and cometabolic bacteria for in situ bioremediation of 1 4 dioxane the effectiveness of each bioremediation strategy depends strongly on aquifer permeability dispersion groundwater mixing biomass movement biomass decay competitive inhibition the initial concentration of 1 4 dioxane and biomass and oxygen and propane injection rates the results from this study indicate that gas sparging with air and propane coupled to bioaugmentation with a propanotrophic culture will achieve a faster rate of remediation than air sparging and bioaugmentation with a culture that metabolically biodegrades 1 4 dioxane as long as the initial concentration of 1 4 dioxane is less than approximately 7 5 to 10 mg l 1 that is the case for the majority of 1 4 dioxane plumes that have been characterized thus far the results of this study can be broadened by evaluating other bacteria that degrade 1 4 dioxane the number of microbes known to biodegrade 1 4 dioxane continues to expand including acinetobacter baumanii strain dd1 huang et al 2014 mycobacterium dioxanotrophicus ph 06 kim et al 2009 and rhodanobacter ays5 pugazhendi et al 2015 microbes known to cometabolize 1 4 dioxane also continue to increase including azoarcus sp dd4 which is also able to cometabolize 1 1 dichloroethene deng et al 2018 some of these newly identified microbes may be more competitive than cb1190 and env425 due to their higher affinity for 1 4 dioxane higher yield and greater resistance to inhibition by chlorinated solvents deng et al 2018 therefore applying the systematic approach employed in the present study would be beneficial to elucidate the preferred microorganisms for
