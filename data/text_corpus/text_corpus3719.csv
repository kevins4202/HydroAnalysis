18595,many chemicals with different physico chemical properties are present in municipal wastewater in this study the removal of a broad range of trace organic chemicals torcs was determined in two biological treatment processes differing in hydraulic retention time sequential biofiltration sbf and soil aquifer treatment sat operated in germany and spain occurrence and the degree of removal of more than 150 torcs with different physico chemical properties were analysed including precursors as well as human metabolites and environmental transformation products tps ninety torcs were detected in the feed water of the sbf system 40 of these showed removal efficiencies of higher than 30 during biological treatment in sat 70 torcs were detected in the feed water 60 of these could be reduced by more than 30 after approximately 3 days of subsurface treatment for uncharged and negatively charged torcs biological degradation was mainly responsible for the removal while positively charged torcs were most likely also removed by ionic interactions the detections of tps confirmed that biodegradation was a major removal process in both systems the analysis of positively and negatively charged neutral and zwitterionic torcs and the simultaneous analysis of precursors and their biologically formed tps enabled a detailed understanding of underlying mechanisms of their removal in the two systems on this basis criteria for site specific indicator selection were proposed graphical abstract image 1 keywords removal processes soil aquifer treatment sequential biofiltration trace organic chemicals 1 introduction world wide depletion of drinking water sources for example groundwater aquifers is of growing concern for countries suffering from water scarcity the use of reclaimed water via soil aquifer treatment sat might be an attractive way to augment aquifers and thus overcome the depletion of drinking water sources sharma and kennedy 2017 here an effluent of a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp is infiltrated after advanced treatment into an unsaturated vadose zone and is further purified by biological and physical processes occurring during soil passage sat is seen as a cost effective treatment technology with stable performance it has the ability to remove certain trace organic chemicals torcs as well as pathogens he et al 2016 regnery et al 2017 sharma and kennedy 2017 however in full scale applications a variety of factors influence the attenuation of torcs such as ph redox conditions biodegradable dissolved organic carbon bdoc temperature flow rates soil composition etc he et al 2016 maeng et al 2010 there is a strong interest in the elucidation of processes to optimize attenuation capabilities studies on specific behaviour of torcs during sat were performed using lab and pilot scale column studies fed with artificial and real wastewaters biodegradation sorption and combinations thereof were studied chefetz et al 2008 he et al 2016 maeng et al 2011 onesios and bouwer 2012 biodegradation can be a removal process for a variety of torcs but efficiencies were shown to be influenced by the effluent organic matter composition and concentration of the feed waters predominant redox conditions and the specific microorganisms present in the system falas et al 2016 rauch williams et al 2010 regnery et al 2017 these findings were transferred to full scale studies introducing the sequential managed aquifer recharge technology smart concept hellauer et al 2018a regnery et al 2016 here short term managed aquifer recharge mar either via bank filtration or sat was performed the reclaimed water was then recovered and re aerated by surface spreading prior to a second infiltration step by this method oxic conditions can be maintained during the second subsurface treatment step for further optimization of this sequential treatment the concept of sequential biofiltration sbf was introduced müller et al 2017 this engineered above ground treatment system is designed as two sequential filter stages with intermediate aeration or oxidation steps hellauer et al 2017 müller et al 2017 it was found that the biodegradation of several moderately degradable torcs was enhanced by maintaining fully oxic and carbon starving conditions in the second filter stage and that travel times could be reduced drastically compared to conventional mar applications however retardation by sorption can also play an important role for the removal of specific torcs in mar hydrophobicity of torcs enhanced sorption and ionic interactions were found responsible for retardation of partially positively charged torcs schaffer et al 2012 however variations in prevailing conditions and soil characteristics limit the prediction of removal for individual compounds in mar systems thus indicator chemicals were proposed for process evaluations representing certain physico chemical or biological properties of an entire family of chemicals dickenson et al 2009 and jekel et al 2015 proposed indicator chemicals for different treatment systems as for conventional and advanced techniques as well as for bank filtration and sat funke et al 2015 proposed the use of oxypurinol which is partly excreted by humans and formed in wwtps from transformation of the anti gout allopurinol and its conjugates recently a multi disciplinary indicator concept to highlight the efficiencies of municipal wwtps to remove torcs as well as pathogens was reported by ternes et al 2017 however none of the studies allowed to derive a more fundamental understanding of underlying removal mechanisms during aquifer passage to address the huge number of torcs used world wide it is furthermore crucial to consider the large variety of different biological and physico chemical properties being positively or negatively charged zwitterionic or not charged at all or being well moderately or poorly degradable in this study the removal of more than 150 torcs including human metabolites and tps was studied in two biological systems i an engineered above ground sbf system with intermediate aeration and ii a natural full scale sat system while compound removal in the sbf system filled with anthracite and technical sand is dominated by biodegradation different mechanisms might contribute to torc removal in the natural sat system compounds with different physico chemical properties i e positively negatively charged neutral and zwitterionic compounds as well as pairs of precursors and tps were included to enable a detailed understanding of underlying mechanisms for compound removal in these two systems and to derive potential candidates for future indicator selection 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents a list of the target chemicals including cas registry numbers and supplier can be found in hermes et al 2018 lc ms grade methanol and acetonitrile both lichrosolv were supplied by merck darmstadt germany formic acid and acetic acid as eluent additives for lc ms were purchased from sigma aldrich seelze germany 2 2 pilot scale sbf the sbf system is described in detail by müller et al 2017 fig 1 in brief a back washable filter column a was operated with anthracite as filter material grain sizes 1 4 2 5 mm as a first stage filter the filters of the second stage s1 s2 were filled with technical sand grain sizes 0 2 1 0 mm and inoculated with 5 aquifer material from a bank filtration site first and second stage filters had a filter bed height of 1 05 m and 0 95 m and an inner diameter of 0 15 m and 0 1 m respectively between the filters an aeration step with pressurized air was implemented the filter train was fed with tertiary effluent from the wwtp garching germany empty bed contact times ebcts were adjusted by the flowrate of the water to 90 min in the anthracite filter a 200 min in s1 and 2000 min in s2 a few torcs were spiked into the feed water to follow their attenuation processes caffeine carbamazepine citalopram diclofenac diphenhydramine iopromide metoprolol phenytoin primidone sulfamethoxazole tramadol venlafaxine trimethoprim atenolol and climbazole torcs were spiked to concentrations ranging from 0 5 to 3 μg l three sampling campaigns were performed for the sbf system within three weeks by collecting corresponding samples from the feed water and after each treatment column 2 3 full scale sat the full scale sat site was located in a small town 1000 inhabitants in the costa brava region of spain the local wwtp applies conventional secondary treatment followed by advanced treatment by dual media filtration uv disinfection and gac filtration during the monitoring campaign the gac was by passed a week before the sampling campaign to only observe the effect of the soil passage the treated wastewater was transferred to an elevated storage tank from here it was conveyed by gravity to the infiltration basin the basin had a depth of 1 m and had a 40 cm thick layer of technical sand at the bottom two observation wells were located downgradient of the infiltration basin fig 1 the first at a distance of 3 m with a travel time of about 30 h and the second at a distance of about 20 m with a travel time of about 3 d demoware 2016 the well for drinking water production was located at a distance of about 1 km downstream of the recharge basin with water travel times of about 1 5 years and was not sampled in this study subsurface geology was composed of rocks at gravel size and a matrix of sand and silt drillings for the observation wells identified also regions with plastic clays a groundwater level of 8 m below the surface of the observation wells sat 1 and sat 2 close to the infiltration basin indicated that initial infiltration was characterized by vertical infiltration under unsaturated conditions sampling was carried out at three consecutive days by taking grab samples at the basin and the two observation wells and in total four samples were taken for each sampling point water samples were immediately filtered by 0 45 μm regenerated cellulose filters and samples were stored in a freezer 20 c pending analysis 2 4 analytical methods the analytical method for quantification of more than 150 torcs including tps is described in detail in hermes et al 2018 in brief direct injection lc ms ms analysis split into two detection methods was performed on a hplc 1260 infinity series equipped with a zorbax eclipse plus c18 column 150 mm 2 1 mm 3 5 μm agilent technologies coupled to a triplequad mass spectrometer 6500 sciex a water acetonitrile gradient was used for detection method 1 the aqueous phase was buffered with 0 1 formic acid while detection method 2 was buffered with 0 1 acetic acid analysis was performed in scheduled mrm mode using deuterium labelled surrogates as internal standards for quantification detailed information on mrm transitions and assignment of internal standard to the analytes and validation parameters are reported in hermes et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 selection of torcs a wide range of torcs with different properties and uses are present in wwtp effluents evgenidou et al 2015 gurke et al 2015 petrie et al 2016 to get a comprehensive overview the chemical selection was based on a variety of criteria pharmaceuticals personal care products industrial chemicals artificial sweeteners as well as pesticides were included furthermore human metabolites and tps were targeted consumption of chemicals in germany schwabe et al 2017 was considered as well as the occurrence of torcs in world wide monitoring studies furthermore the bio degradability of torcs in conventional wwtps was a crucial criterion the selected torcs cover different physico chemical properties in terms of pka and log kow d and thus substances being negatively or positively charged zwitterionic or not charged at ph 7 were addressed all selected torcs were detectable with the same analytical method a complete list of monitored chemicals including the usage physico chemical properties degradability in conventional wwtps and limit of quantification loq for the analysis method can be found in the supplemental information si table si1 some of the included torcs were not considered in monitoring studies so far gabapentin lactam for example is a rather new tp henning et al 2018 which to the best of our knowledge has not yet been included in current monitoring studies the tp valsartan acid has been known for several years nödler et al 2013 but information about its environmental fate is scarce and further substances for example sitagliptin or denatonium were identified as potential water contaminants with higher concentrations only recently hermes et al 2018 3 2 fate and removal in sbf the sbf system was fed with tertiary effluent from the municipal wwtp located in garching germany having a capacity of 31 000 people equivalents more than 90 torcs were detected in the feed water with concentrations above the loq detected concentrations ranged from 0 004 μg l phenytoin to 15 0 μg l oxypurinol more than 10 torcs showed concentrations of higher than 1 0 μg l such as the artificial sweeteners sucralose and acesulfame the corrosion inhibitor benzotriazole the pharmaceuticals sitagliptin diclofenac gabapentin and valsartan as well as the tps metabolites of pharmaceuticals acyclovir carboxylic acid valsartan acid and o desmethyl venlafaxine pesticides were mainly detected at lower concentration levels except for mecoprop which exhibited a high variability with concentrations ranging from 0 37 to 2 2 μg l the strength of the sbf system compared to sat is the enhancement of the oxic biodegradation potential by establishing controlled oxic conditions within the second filter at substantially shorter hydraulic retention times hrts fig 2 shows a boxplot of the achieved averaged removal of torcs in a single column a s1 and s2 and in the overall sbf systems combining two columns a s1 a s2 here only those torcs were considered which showed a removal of greater than 30 in the second filter stage of the sbf system 40 torcs in total as expected there was a reduction in removal with decreasing ebct the median removal of torcs in s2 with an ebct of 2000 min was 75 while it was 55 for s1 with an ebct of 200 min this behaviour was also reported by müller et al 2017 and explained by the difference in ebct but might also be related to the reduced redox conditions in the columns i e a change from oxic to suboxic conditions see also si figure si2 column a was characterized by a rapid consumption of dissolved oxygen do yet still maintaining oxic conditions do 2 mg l at the outlet by re aeration oxic conditions could be established in the influent of columns s1 and s2 but do concentrations dropped rapidly within the first 10 cm of the columns for s1 do remained at about 3 mg l while in s2 a constant decrease to less than 1 mg l do was observed thus in s1 oxic conditions prevailed while s2 dropped to suboxic conditions decreasing do concentrations might adversely affect the degradation of certain torcs looking at the overall removal of all detected torcs in the sbf system grouped by their charge at ph 7 fig 3 a it seemed as if negatively charged and zwitter ionic compounds could be removed more effectively as indicated by the median values in comparison to neutral and positively charged ones however the range of removal values was the same for all groups and spanned over no removal at all to complete attenuation in table 1 the concentrations of selected torcs those showing concentration of 10 times higher than the loq in the influent to the system and in fig 4 the removal of all detected substances in the systems are shown for concentrations and removal of all torcs see si table si3 less than 50 of all detected torcs exhibited a moderate to good removal 30 removal in sbf could mainly be attributed to bio degradation removal by sorption was negligible since the columns were filled with anthracite and technical sand furthermore the systems were run continuously for three years prior to this study thus sorption equilibria were assumed to be reached for most torcs as reported by müller et al 2017 more than 50 of the non charged torcs were persistent during the sbf treatment for several of them e g carbamazepine and primidone this was expected from previous studies gurke et al 2015 he et al 2016 for compounds showing removal 30 biodegradation could be verified as the major removal mechanism by the detection of respective tps in the column effluents fig 5 although carbamazepine was persistent its metabolite 10 oh carbamazepine was removed by 50 in column a and up to 90 in system a s2 its biodegradation was confirmed by the detection of its zwitterionic tp 9 carboxy acridine kaiser et al 2014 the transformation pathway from 10 oh carbamazepine to 9 carboxy acridine involves oxidative steps and thus the prevalence of oxic conditions enhanced its transformation fig 5a the mass balance was closed when considering that 10 oh carbamazepine was removed and 9 carboxy acridine was formed however there might be a gap in the mass balance for a s2 where the removal of 10 oh carbamazepine could not only be explained by the formation of 9 carboxy acridine as it was possible in a s1 either further degradation processes possibly taking place only under suboxic conditions were involved or sampling frequencies were not sufficient for these torcs even more pronounced were the effects of redox conditions and ebct on the behaviour of climbazole fig 5b in column a only a minor removal of climbazole was observed but the closed mass balance indicated that climbazole oh was the main tp in the sequential approach a s1 the removal of climbazole was enhanced and the formation of the tps was more pronounced however the gap in the mass balance indicated a further removal of either the tps or the formation of unknown tps a s2 representing longer ebcts exhibited the lowest concentrations of climbazole and the highest for the tp climbazole oh and in sum only 15 of the initial concentration remained brienza and chiron 2017 stated that the bio degradation of climbazole can occur under anaerobic conditions thus processes under suboxic conditions at longer ebct of a s2 might have contributed to the enhanced degradation compared to the fully oxic condition of a s1 column for the x ray contrast medium iopromide initial concentration 0 05 μg l 0 06 nmol l spiked at 1 μg l 1 26 nmol l concentrations were reduced by more than 80 in a s1 and by more than 90 in a s2 degradation of iopromide under oxic conditions was studied in detail by schulz et al 2008 and seven of the major tps were included into this analytical method as isolated reference standards were available five of these iopromide tps were detected during sbf studies all of them could be already detected in the feed water the final stable tp of the oxic transformation pathway was not detected and thus the transformation of iopromide was incomplete the mass balance for iopromide and its tps fig 5c reveals the formation of tps 729a 759 and 701a during sbf treatment these results support the findings of müller et al 2019 the concentrations of the majority of the negatively charged substances were significantly reduced and the formation of tps confirmed that biodegradation played a major role for the removal however some negatively charged substances were also persistent e g diclofenac of the sartan group only valsartan was removed by more than 90 already in column a highlighting the rapid biodegradability of this substance bayer et al 2014 suggested that the biodegradability was due to the amide moiety and the aliphatic carboxyl moiety the mass balance for valsartan and its tp valsartan acid fig 5d indicated a reduction of the precursor in column a and formation of the tp in a s1 and a s2 effluents valsartan was not detected anymore although a high variation of concentration was observed in a s2 for valsartan acid a clear decrease in concentration compared to column a showed a biodegradability of this tp also in a s1 removal was achieved and comparable mean values between a s1 and a s2 were observed for positively charged substances and zwitterionic torcs a similar pattern as seen for non charged substances was observed about half of the substances were persistent tramadol and its metabolites for example did not exhibit any reduction of their concentrations except for a slight reduction in a s2 as can be seen in the mass balance fig 5e similar results were obtained for sitagliptin and cetirizine biodegradation on the other hand could be confirmed for citalopram due to the formation of desmethyl citalopram and for gabapentin due to the formation of gabapentin lactam both precursor substances showed an increased removal with increased residence time in both second stages s1 and s2 and for citalopram a removal could only be achieved after aeration for gabapentin an increased removal was observed with increasing ebct recently henning et al 2018 observed an enhanced biodegradability of gabapentin under oxic conditions and identified gabapentin lactam as its major tp in sbf partial removal of gabapentin and a slight formation of its tp was also observed in column a see fig 5f in the sbf trains a s1 and a s2 however equal tp concentrations could be detected in the effluents of the column trains despite further removal of gabapentin as a consequence the mass balance was incomplete in all cases with only 15 of the initial summed concentration left showing that either the tp was removed during treatment or that other not analysed tps were formed these results indicate that although in tendency the removal in sum was higher in a s2 than in a s1 redox conditions besides ebct played an important role for an efficient removal of certain torcs the concentrations of torcs such as the insect repellent deet caffeine and valsartan could be efficiently reduced already in column a while for others such as mecoprop and citalopram the longest ebct was essential to achieve a removal of higher than 70 these results emphasize the importance of studying the behaviour of a larger number of torcs to identify suitable indicators for process evaluation 3 3 comparative assessment of fate and removal in sat more than 70 torcs were detected in the feed water to the infiltration basin with concentrations up to 9 0 μg l oxypurinol similar to the sbf system oxypurinol showed the highest concentrations of all torcs studied additional four substances were detected at concentrations exceeding 1 0 μg l which also were amongst the highest concentrations found in the feed water of the sbf system sucralose 7 4 μg l hydrochlorothiazide 1 7 μg l acesulfame 1 7 μg l and valsartan acid 1 6 μg l in comparison to the sbf system which was fed with municipal wwtp effluent from an urban sewershed pesticides were detected at higher frequency and higher concentrations in the feed water of the sat system located in a spanish rural area particularly substances being used as algicides i e diuron terbutryn and irgarol were found at elevated concentrations the system was operated in an area impacted by agricultural activities adjacent to the wwtp and the infiltration site furthermore the site was located close to the mediterranean sea and a small marina was close by thus the detected pesticides might have reached the sampled water by urban run off and leaching the overall removal of all detected torcs in the sat system grouped by their charge at ph 7 fig 3b showed a clearly better removal of positively charged and zwitterionic torcs compared to neutral and negatively charged ones for the latter two groups the attenuation ranged from no removal at all to a good removal of more than 70 while the positively charged torcs could be attenuated nearly completely and the zwitterionic ones up to 100 the concentrations and removal values are illustrated in table 2 for selected torcs with feed water concentration at least 10 times the loq and fig 6 for all detected torcs respectively for concentrations and removal of all torcs see si table si3 the hrt in the sat system was comparable to the sbf system hrt of sat 1 compared to column system a s2 for all substances detected it can be assumed that the major removal occurred during travel through the vadose zone to the first observation well sat 1 the groundwater passage to reach sat 2 had only minor additional improvement of torc removal by measurements of oxygen in the sampled water of sat 1 it could be observed that oxic conditions prevailed in the vadose zone and the concentrations of about 60 of all detected torcs decreased during the soil passage it is noteworthy that the studied sat site was in operation for only three years demoware 2016 prior to the sampling campaign and that the infiltration was not continuously operated during this period baumgarten et al 2011 reported that adaptation for the microbial community to remove certain torcs such as sulfamethoxazole might take up to several years with longer operation time the biodegradation of certain torcs might improve thirty of the non charged torcs were present in the feed water of these 11 torcs exhibited removal efficiencies of higher than 30 in sat 2 after 72 h of retention time while none were removed by more than 80 several torcs were neither removed during sat nor during sbf e g carbamazepine lamotrigine and oxazepam since they are neither biodegradable nor having elevated sorption affinities to soil aquifer particles hydrochlorothiazide was detected at elevated concentrations in the feed water of both systems 3 0 μg l 10 nmol l in sbf 1 5 μg l 5 nmol l in sat in contrast to sbf a removal of hydrochlorothiazide was observed during sat 25 35 while the concentrations of the tp chlorothiazide doubled during soil passage for the total concentrations of hydrochlorothiazide and chlorothiazide see si figure si4g a clear decrease and an incomplete mass balance were observed during sat the sweetener sucralose also was found at elevated concentrations in both systems 5 μg l for both neither in sbf nor in sat a removal was achieved scheurer et al 2009 studied the occurrence of sweeteners in wastewater and after sat in wwtps only a minor removal was observed and at an sat site even a travel time of more than a month did not support removal of sucralose by more than 50 indicating the high mobility and elevated persistence of the artificial sweetener based on sucralose measurements dilution with native groundwater in sat 1 and sat 2 can be characterized as 5 and 15 respectively the antithrombotic agent clopidogrel was detected at very low concentrations 0 001 μg l 0 01 nmol l in both systems a removal of more than 70 was observed the metabolite clopidogrel carboxylic acid zwitterionic at ph 7 was detected at concentrations of around 0 10 μg l 0 24 nmol l in the feed water of both systems in contrast to sbf a removal efficiency of higher than 90 was found in sat see si figure si4h the positively charged site of the zwitter ion might have a major influence on the removal in soil as explained later in this section similar to the sbf system iopromide was degraded but other tps were detected fig 5c while in sat mainly tps were found which are formed in the last reactions of the described transformation pathways e g tp 701a and tp 643 after sbf mainly tps were found which are formed at the beginning of the transformation pathway the most obvious difference was the formation of the final tp 643 during sat in sbf iopromide was spiked into the feed water to follow its degradation process whereas in the feed water of the sat system only the iopromide tps were detected thus no further formation of the early stage tps occurred in sat in contrast to sbf but a further transformation of already formed tps towards the final iopromide tp 643 the herbicides algicides diuron terbutryn and irgarol were detected with concentrations of around 0 10 μg l in the feed water of the sat system all three herbicides were removed by about 50 during the soil passage stasinakis et al 2009 and luft et al 2014 already showed the biodegradability of these substances in wwtps under oxic conditions they also identified tps for all three substances however these tps were not included into the monitoring campaign of this study except for two diuron tps which were detected at low concentrations 0 01 μg l after sat of the negatively charged torcs 20 compounds were detected in the feed water of these 12 torcs were reduced in concentration either by transformation or sorption by more than 30 in sat 2 four even above 90 in both systems sat and sbf oxypurinol was detected at elevated concentrations 9 μg l it was frequently detected in water samples at this concentration range and was stable during wastewater treatment funke et al 2015 it is a highly mobile substance and can thus reach drinking water wells in the sbf system no removal at all was observed for oxypurinol indicating its persistence in biological processes in the sat system a minor change of the concentrations approx 20 during soil passage sat 1 and an overall removal of 40 in sat 2 was observed which is higher than expected from the limited bio degradability reported by funke et al 2015 diclofenac was removed by more than 80 in sat in sbf its reduction was negligible and only a slight formation of its tp diclofenac carboxylate jewell et al 2016b was observed in sat no tps were found neither in the feed water nor after soil passage rühmland et al 2015 observed a removal of diclofenac by photodegradation in in situ degradation experiments and muntau et al 2017 confirmed this at a full scale sat site in northern germany during the sampling campaign for this study samples of the feed water were taken at the pumping station prior to the basin thus it cannot be ruled out that photodegradation occurred in the basin where feed water was exposed to sunlight during operation the observed removal for diclofenac is also in accordance with other sat studies he et al 2016 laws et al 2011 muntau et al 2017 the compounds of the sartan group showed a very different behaviour to each other during soil passage while valsartan was removed very well in both systems irbesartan and telmisartan indicated a moderate to good removal during sat but were stable in sbf olmesartan and candesartan remained stable in both systems in both sbf and sat the concentrations of the tp valsartan acid were reduced see fig 5d neither nödler et al 2013 nor kern et al 2010 observed a removal of valsartan acid in bank filtration and in sludge treatment sorption effects in sat seem to be unlikely due to the very low log d value 1 and thus it is assumed that removal in sat was due to biological degradation as it was also observed during sbf the sweetener acesulfame was detected at concentrations 1 5 μg l in both systems in contrast to the good removal in sbf no removal was observed during sat contradictory results have also been observed in literature showing elevated removal castronovo et al 2017 as well as persistent behaviour jekel et al 2015 of acesulfame in sand filtration and managed aquifer recharge systems the persistent behaviour in some systems including the investigated sat site might be explained by a lack of an adopted microbial community appropriate for degradation of acesulfame in total 24 torcs detected in the feed water were positively charged or zwitterionic all of them showed a removal of higher than 80 in sat 2 except for six torcs which were removed between 30 and 80 in contrast to the sbf system gabapentin was not efficiently removed in sat for its tp gabapentin lactam non charged compound the same behaviour was observed both substances exhibited a removal of only up to 35 see also fig 5f tramadol and venlafaxine as well as their metabolites tps were efficiently removed to more than 80 for tramadol mass balance see fig 5e during sbf removal was only observed for venlafaxine at longer ebcts however other studies also showed an efficient removal of these compounds in column experiments hellauer et al 2018b 2019 considering that also the other positively charged torcs showed a similar behaviour and no tps were detected sorption by ionic interactions i e cation exchange might be a plausible reason for the elevated removal during sat the importance of cation exchange as an attenuation process in sat systems is already described by he et al 2016 but so far it was only reported for a small number of torcs here in total 33 positively charged torcs 18 of these could be detected in the feed water of the sat system and eight zwitterionic substances six detected in the feed water showed a similar removal behaviour these results in combination with the fact that no major tps from these substances could be detected in this nor in other studies support the assumption of a removal by sorption probably due to cation exchange during soil passage 3 4 direct comparison of removal in sbf and sat in this study two different treatment systems an engineered above ground biological system sbf and a natural below ground soil passage system sat were studied the removal of a broad set of torcs and tps with different physico chemical properties was utilized for water quality evaluation for the sbf system redox conditions changed from oxic to suboxic by adjusting the hrt while in the sat system oxic conditions prevailed for the direct comparison of results from sat and sbf systems in fig 7 treatment options sat 1 and a s2 were chosen due to comparable hrts approximately 70 torcs were detected in the feed water of both systems by classification of the removal results process based indicator chemicals can be deduced meeting the following criteria persistent removal 30 moderate removal 30 70 and good removal 70 these classes are highlighted by blue boxes in fig 7 furthermore two areas of torcs with a completely different behaviour are marked as red boxes the compounds in blue boxes represent candidates for process evaluation of natural and biological treatment systems as they show consistent behaviour in both systems several torcs which are known to be persistent in conventional wwtps declared as stable in fig 7 were also found to be persistent in sbf and sat amongst these were carbamazepine and candesartan but also human metabolites tps such as 10 11 dihydroxy carbamazepine in the group of moderately removable torcs the tp valsartan acid can be found together with emtricitabine and furosemide an elevated removal was observed in both systems for 10 torcs such as valsartan fexofenadine and citalopram probably due to biological degradation however no single dominant transformation of specific compound moieties was observed rather removal could be partly attributed to different transformation reactions such as hydrogenation dehydrogenation amide hydrolysis and demethylation climbazole for example is transformed by the reduction hydrogenation of the keto function to an alcohol moiety brienza and chiron 2017 while for fexofenadine oxidation dehydrogenation of the secondary alcohol to a keto moiety can be assumed henning et al 2019 amide hydrolysis is involved in the transformations of atenolol to atenolol acid and valsartan to valsartan acid helbling et al 2010 trimethoprim has been stated to be degraded by demethylation of a methoxy group followed by hydroxylation and oxidation jewell et al 2016a consistently in literature these mechanisms were found to proceed rather fast however no generalized conclusion about a dependency between specific compound moieties and the degradation efficiency in both systems can be drawn aliskiren for example contains a primary amide which might be expected to hydrolyse quickly as found for atenolol however no removal could be observed in sbf similarly acyclovir was degraded in sbf to more than 90 and the formation of acyclovir acid confirmed the proposed mechanism of oxidation of primary alcohols prasse et al 2011 in sat removal of acyclovir was very low with about 30 during the sampling campaign a considerable higher removal in sbf compared to sat was also observed for deet which has been reported to be transformed by a dealkylation of the tertiary amine and an oxidation of the methyl moiety helbling et al 2010 further examples for inconsistent behaviour in sat and sbf are acesulfame and gabapentin which is in accordance with a high variability of degradation reported in literature burke et al 2018 henning et al 2018 storck et al 2015 for all compounds with at least partly positively charged amine moieties at ambient ph e g tramadol venlafaxine sitagliptin and denatonium a considerable higher removal was observed in sat however while removal of individual compounds such as venlafaxine and tramadol might also be attributed to biodegradation the consistent behaviour of 18 detected positively charged and zwitterionic compounds supports the assumption of cation exchange as an additional removal mechanism in summary it was found that no generalized moiety specific conclusion could be drawn on the underlying attenuation mechanisms and emphasizes the need of a multi compound method applied in this study based on fig 7 a list of possible candidates for indicator substances are proposed in table 3 grouping torcs with a similar behaviour in both studied sbf and sat or a completely contrary behaviour nevertheless for all proposed torcs their occurrence needs to be confirmed to choose them as site specific indicator substances 4 conclusions based on the occurrence and removal of more than 100 torcs human metabolites and transformation products in two different biological treatment systems a sequential biofiltration system with dominant compound removal by biodegradation and a soil aquifer treatment system with hrt of a few days where also sorption and dilution effects are relevant the following conclusions can be drawn in both systems human metabolites and environmental tps were sometimes detected in higher concentrations than the precursors e g clopidogrel acid via clopidogrel since certain tps exhibit a higher polarity and are rather persistent they should be considered when designing monitoring concepts for process evaluation both systems demonstrated their capability as effective treatment steps since attenuation in sbf is only achieved by biodegradation removal efficiency depends on redox conditions and hrt while non biodegradable torcs will always persist in sat a combination of biotransformation and sorption effects was able to remove a broader set of torcs however the efficiency depends on site characteristics for example soil properties or the adaption stage of the microbial community in addition torcs breakthrough might occur after longer operation periods triggering the need for long term monitoring of potentially sorbed substances as removal capacities in the soil are mostly unknown results confirmed that the analysis of parent compounds and their major tps provides an efficient measure to understand driving removal mechanisms in natural and biological systems increased tp concentration in effluents or monitoring wells confirmed biodegradation as a major mechanism for neutral e g climbazole iopromide and negatively charged valsartan compounds the selection of a large range of different torcs revealed additional information while most positively charged compounds were persistent in sbf consistently good removal was observed in sat indicating cation exchange as major removal mechanism a selection of performance based indicator chemicals and tps must be adapted to site specific conditions and should contain representatives of the following criteria 1 torcs with different physico chemical properties at environmental ph 7 9 i non charged ii positively charged iii negatively charged iv zwitterionic 2 torcs with different removal degrees removal by transformation processes or sorption i good removal 70 ii moderate removal 30 70 iii persistent 30 3 torcs with feed water concentrations of more than 10 times the loq 4 pairs of precursor substances and their major human metabolites and tps furthermore the location of the treatment site and thus the likelihood of the appearance of substance classes e g pharmaceuticals or pesticides has to be considered for instance different torcs were present in urban sbf and rural sat areas therefore a pre monitoring of

18595,many chemicals with different physico chemical properties are present in municipal wastewater in this study the removal of a broad range of trace organic chemicals torcs was determined in two biological treatment processes differing in hydraulic retention time sequential biofiltration sbf and soil aquifer treatment sat operated in germany and spain occurrence and the degree of removal of more than 150 torcs with different physico chemical properties were analysed including precursors as well as human metabolites and environmental transformation products tps ninety torcs were detected in the feed water of the sbf system 40 of these showed removal efficiencies of higher than 30 during biological treatment in sat 70 torcs were detected in the feed water 60 of these could be reduced by more than 30 after approximately 3 days of subsurface treatment for uncharged and negatively charged torcs biological degradation was mainly responsible for the removal while positively charged torcs were most likely also removed by ionic interactions the detections of tps confirmed that biodegradation was a major removal process in both systems the analysis of positively and negatively charged neutral and zwitterionic torcs and the simultaneous analysis of precursors and their biologically formed tps enabled a detailed understanding of underlying mechanisms of their removal in the two systems on this basis criteria for site specific indicator selection were proposed graphical abstract image 1 keywords removal processes soil aquifer treatment sequential biofiltration trace organic chemicals 1 introduction world wide depletion of drinking water sources for example groundwater aquifers is of growing concern for countries suffering from water scarcity the use of reclaimed water via soil aquifer treatment sat might be an attractive way to augment aquifers and thus overcome the depletion of drinking water sources sharma and kennedy 2017 here an effluent of a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp is infiltrated after advanced treatment into an unsaturated vadose zone and is further purified by biological and physical processes occurring during soil passage sat is seen as a cost effective treatment technology with stable performance it has the ability to remove certain trace organic chemicals torcs as well as pathogens he et al 2016 regnery et al 2017 sharma and kennedy 2017 however in full scale applications a variety of factors influence the attenuation of torcs such as ph redox conditions biodegradable dissolved organic carbon bdoc temperature flow rates soil composition etc he et al 2016 maeng et al 2010 there is a strong interest in the elucidation of processes to optimize attenuation capabilities studies on specific behaviour of torcs during sat were performed using lab and pilot scale column studies fed with artificial and real wastewaters biodegradation sorption and combinations thereof were studied chefetz et al 2008 he et al 2016 maeng et al 2011 onesios and bouwer 2012 biodegradation can be a removal process for a variety of torcs but efficiencies were shown to be influenced by the effluent organic matter composition and concentration of the feed waters predominant redox conditions and the specific microorganisms present in the system falas et al 2016 rauch williams et al 2010 regnery et al 2017 these findings were transferred to full scale studies introducing the sequential managed aquifer recharge technology smart concept hellauer et al 2018a regnery et al 2016 here short term managed aquifer recharge mar either via bank filtration or sat was performed the reclaimed water was then recovered and re aerated by surface spreading prior to a second infiltration step by this method oxic conditions can be maintained during the second subsurface treatment step for further optimization of this sequential treatment the concept of sequential biofiltration sbf was introduced müller et al 2017 this engineered above ground treatment system is designed as two sequential filter stages with intermediate aeration or oxidation steps hellauer et al 2017 müller et al 2017 it was found that the biodegradation of several moderately degradable torcs was enhanced by maintaining fully oxic and carbon starving conditions in the second filter stage and that travel times could be reduced drastically compared to conventional mar applications however retardation by sorption can also play an important role for the removal of specific torcs in mar hydrophobicity of torcs enhanced sorption and ionic interactions were found responsible for retardation of partially positively charged torcs schaffer et al 2012 however variations in prevailing conditions and soil characteristics limit the prediction of removal for individual compounds in mar systems thus indicator chemicals were proposed for process evaluations representing certain physico chemical or biological properties of an entire family of chemicals dickenson et al 2009 and jekel et al 2015 proposed indicator chemicals for different treatment systems as for conventional and advanced techniques as well as for bank filtration and sat funke et al 2015 proposed the use of oxypurinol which is partly excreted by humans and formed in wwtps from transformation of the anti gout allopurinol and its conjugates recently a multi disciplinary indicator concept to highlight the efficiencies of municipal wwtps to remove torcs as well as pathogens was reported by ternes et al 2017 however none of the studies allowed to derive a more fundamental understanding of underlying removal mechanisms during aquifer passage to address the huge number of torcs used world wide it is furthermore crucial to consider the large variety of different biological and physico chemical properties being positively or negatively charged zwitterionic or not charged at all or being well moderately or poorly degradable in this study the removal of more than 150 torcs including human metabolites and tps was studied in two biological systems i an engineered above ground sbf system with intermediate aeration and ii a natural full scale sat system while compound removal in the sbf system filled with anthracite and technical sand is dominated by biodegradation different mechanisms might contribute to torc removal in the natural sat system compounds with different physico chemical properties i e positively negatively charged neutral and zwitterionic compounds as well as pairs of precursors and tps were included to enable a detailed understanding of underlying mechanisms for compound removal in these two systems and to derive potential candidates for future indicator selection 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents a list of the target chemicals including cas registry numbers and supplier can be found in hermes et al 2018 lc ms grade methanol and acetonitrile both lichrosolv were supplied by merck darmstadt germany formic acid and acetic acid as eluent additives for lc ms were purchased from sigma aldrich seelze germany 2 2 pilot scale sbf the sbf system is described in detail by müller et al 2017 fig 1 in brief a back washable filter column a was operated with anthracite as filter material grain sizes 1 4 2 5 mm as a first stage filter the filters of the second stage s1 s2 were filled with technical sand grain sizes 0 2 1 0 mm and inoculated with 5 aquifer material from a bank filtration site first and second stage filters had a filter bed height of 1 05 m and 0 95 m and an inner diameter of 0 15 m and 0 1 m respectively between the filters an aeration step with pressurized air was implemented the filter train was fed with tertiary effluent from the wwtp garching germany empty bed contact times ebcts were adjusted by the flowrate of the water to 90 min in the anthracite filter a 200 min in s1 and 2000 min in s2 a few torcs were spiked into the feed water to follow their attenuation processes caffeine carbamazepine citalopram diclofenac diphenhydramine iopromide metoprolol phenytoin primidone sulfamethoxazole tramadol venlafaxine trimethoprim atenolol and climbazole torcs were spiked to concentrations ranging from 0 5 to 3 μg l three sampling campaigns were performed for the sbf system within three weeks by collecting corresponding samples from the feed water and after each treatment column 2 3 full scale sat the full scale sat site was located in a small town 1000 inhabitants in the costa brava region of spain the local wwtp applies conventional secondary treatment followed by advanced treatment by dual media filtration uv disinfection and gac filtration during the monitoring campaign the gac was by passed a week before the sampling campaign to only observe the effect of the soil passage the treated wastewater was transferred to an elevated storage tank from here it was conveyed by gravity to the infiltration basin the basin had a depth of 1 m and had a 40 cm thick layer of technical sand at the bottom two observation wells were located downgradient of the infiltration basin fig 1 the first at a distance of 3 m with a travel time of about 30 h and the second at a distance of about 20 m with a travel time of about 3 d demoware 2016 the well for drinking water production was located at a distance of about 1 km downstream of the recharge basin with water travel times of about 1 5 years and was not sampled in this study subsurface geology was composed of rocks at gravel size and a matrix of sand and silt drillings for the observation wells identified also regions with plastic clays a groundwater level of 8 m below the surface of the observation wells sat 1 and sat 2 close to the infiltration basin indicated that initial infiltration was characterized by vertical infiltration under unsaturated conditions sampling was carried out at three consecutive days by taking grab samples at the basin and the two observation wells and in total four samples were taken for each sampling point water samples were immediately filtered by 0 45 μm regenerated cellulose filters and samples were stored in a freezer 20 c pending analysis 2 4 analytical methods the analytical method for quantification of more than 150 torcs including tps is described in detail in hermes et al 2018 in brief direct injection lc ms ms analysis split into two detection methods was performed on a hplc 1260 infinity series equipped with a zorbax eclipse plus c18 column 150 mm 2 1 mm 3 5 μm agilent technologies coupled to a triplequad mass spectrometer 6500 sciex a water acetonitrile gradient was used for detection method 1 the aqueous phase was buffered with 0 1 formic acid while detection method 2 was buffered with 0 1 acetic acid analysis was performed in scheduled mrm mode using deuterium labelled surrogates as internal standards for quantification detailed information on mrm transitions and assignment of internal standard to the analytes and validation parameters are reported in hermes et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 selection of torcs a wide range of torcs with different properties and uses are present in wwtp effluents evgenidou et al 2015 gurke et al 2015 petrie et al 2016 to get a comprehensive overview the chemical selection was based on a variety of criteria pharmaceuticals personal care products industrial chemicals artificial sweeteners as well as pesticides were included furthermore human metabolites and tps were targeted consumption of chemicals in germany schwabe et al 2017 was considered as well as the occurrence of torcs in world wide monitoring studies furthermore the bio degradability of torcs in conventional wwtps was a crucial criterion the selected torcs cover different physico chemical properties in terms of pka and log kow d and thus substances being negatively or positively charged zwitterionic or not charged at ph 7 were addressed all selected torcs were detectable with the same analytical method a complete list of monitored chemicals including the usage physico chemical properties degradability in conventional wwtps and limit of quantification loq for the analysis method can be found in the supplemental information si table si1 some of the included torcs were not considered in monitoring studies so far gabapentin lactam for example is a rather new tp henning et al 2018 which to the best of our knowledge has not yet been included in current monitoring studies the tp valsartan acid has been known for several years nödler et al 2013 but information about its environmental fate is scarce and further substances for example sitagliptin or denatonium were identified as potential water contaminants with higher concentrations only recently hermes et al 2018 3 2 fate and removal in sbf the sbf system was fed with tertiary effluent from the municipal wwtp located in garching germany having a capacity of 31 000 people equivalents more than 90 torcs were detected in the feed water with concentrations above the loq detected concentrations ranged from 0 004 μg l phenytoin to 15 0 μg l oxypurinol more than 10 torcs showed concentrations of higher than 1 0 μg l such as the artificial sweeteners sucralose and acesulfame the corrosion inhibitor benzotriazole the pharmaceuticals sitagliptin diclofenac gabapentin and valsartan as well as the tps metabolites of pharmaceuticals acyclovir carboxylic acid valsartan acid and o desmethyl venlafaxine pesticides were mainly detected at lower concentration levels except for mecoprop which exhibited a high variability with concentrations ranging from 0 37 to 2 2 μg l the strength of the sbf system compared to sat is the enhancement of the oxic biodegradation potential by establishing controlled oxic conditions within the second filter at substantially shorter hydraulic retention times hrts fig 2 shows a boxplot of the achieved averaged removal of torcs in a single column a s1 and s2 and in the overall sbf systems combining two columns a s1 a s2 here only those torcs were considered which showed a removal of greater than 30 in the second filter stage of the sbf system 40 torcs in total as expected there was a reduction in removal with decreasing ebct the median removal of torcs in s2 with an ebct of 2000 min was 75 while it was 55 for s1 with an ebct of 200 min this behaviour was also reported by müller et al 2017 and explained by the difference in ebct but might also be related to the reduced redox conditions in the columns i e a change from oxic to suboxic conditions see also si figure si2 column a was characterized by a rapid consumption of dissolved oxygen do yet still maintaining oxic conditions do 2 mg l at the outlet by re aeration oxic conditions could be established in the influent of columns s1 and s2 but do concentrations dropped rapidly within the first 10 cm of the columns for s1 do remained at about 3 mg l while in s2 a constant decrease to less than 1 mg l do was observed thus in s1 oxic conditions prevailed while s2 dropped to suboxic conditions decreasing do concentrations might adversely affect the degradation of certain torcs looking at the overall removal of all detected torcs in the sbf system grouped by their charge at ph 7 fig 3 a it seemed as if negatively charged and zwitter ionic compounds could be removed more effectively as indicated by the median values in comparison to neutral and positively charged ones however the range of removal values was the same for all groups and spanned over no removal at all to complete attenuation in table 1 the concentrations of selected torcs those showing concentration of 10 times higher than the loq in the influent to the system and in fig 4 the removal of all detected substances in the systems are shown for concentrations and removal of all torcs see si table si3 less than 50 of all detected torcs exhibited a moderate to good removal 30 removal in sbf could mainly be attributed to bio degradation removal by sorption was negligible since the columns were filled with anthracite and technical sand furthermore the systems were run continuously for three years prior to this study thus sorption equilibria were assumed to be reached for most torcs as reported by müller et al 2017 more than 50 of the non charged torcs were persistent during the sbf treatment for several of them e g carbamazepine and primidone this was expected from previous studies gurke et al 2015 he et al 2016 for compounds showing removal 30 biodegradation could be verified as the major removal mechanism by the detection of respective tps in the column effluents fig 5 although carbamazepine was persistent its metabolite 10 oh carbamazepine was removed by 50 in column a and up to 90 in system a s2 its biodegradation was confirmed by the detection of its zwitterionic tp 9 carboxy acridine kaiser et al 2014 the transformation pathway from 10 oh carbamazepine to 9 carboxy acridine involves oxidative steps and thus the prevalence of oxic conditions enhanced its transformation fig 5a the mass balance was closed when considering that 10 oh carbamazepine was removed and 9 carboxy acridine was formed however there might be a gap in the mass balance for a s2 where the removal of 10 oh carbamazepine could not only be explained by the formation of 9 carboxy acridine as it was possible in a s1 either further degradation processes possibly taking place only under suboxic conditions were involved or sampling frequencies were not sufficient for these torcs even more pronounced were the effects of redox conditions and ebct on the behaviour of climbazole fig 5b in column a only a minor removal of climbazole was observed but the closed mass balance indicated that climbazole oh was the main tp in the sequential approach a s1 the removal of climbazole was enhanced and the formation of the tps was more pronounced however the gap in the mass balance indicated a further removal of either the tps or the formation of unknown tps a s2 representing longer ebcts exhibited the lowest concentrations of climbazole and the highest for the tp climbazole oh and in sum only 15 of the initial concentration remained brienza and chiron 2017 stated that the bio degradation of climbazole can occur under anaerobic conditions thus processes under suboxic conditions at longer ebct of a s2 might have contributed to the enhanced degradation compared to the fully oxic condition of a s1 column for the x ray contrast medium iopromide initial concentration 0 05 μg l 0 06 nmol l spiked at 1 μg l 1 26 nmol l concentrations were reduced by more than 80 in a s1 and by more than 90 in a s2 degradation of iopromide under oxic conditions was studied in detail by schulz et al 2008 and seven of the major tps were included into this analytical method as isolated reference standards were available five of these iopromide tps were detected during sbf studies all of them could be already detected in the feed water the final stable tp of the oxic transformation pathway was not detected and thus the transformation of iopromide was incomplete the mass balance for iopromide and its tps fig 5c reveals the formation of tps 729a 759 and 701a during sbf treatment these results support the findings of müller et al 2019 the concentrations of the majority of the negatively charged substances were significantly reduced and the formation of tps confirmed that biodegradation played a major role for the removal however some negatively charged substances were also persistent e g diclofenac of the sartan group only valsartan was removed by more than 90 already in column a highlighting the rapid biodegradability of this substance bayer et al 2014 suggested that the biodegradability was due to the amide moiety and the aliphatic carboxyl moiety the mass balance for valsartan and its tp valsartan acid fig 5d indicated a reduction of the precursor in column a and formation of the tp in a s1 and a s2 effluents valsartan was not detected anymore although a high variation of concentration was observed in a s2 for valsartan acid a clear decrease in concentration compared to column a showed a biodegradability of this tp also in a s1 removal was achieved and comparable mean values between a s1 and a s2 were observed for positively charged substances and zwitterionic torcs a similar pattern as seen for non charged substances was observed about half of the substances were persistent tramadol and its metabolites for example did not exhibit any reduction of their concentrations except for a slight reduction in a s2 as can be seen in the mass balance fig 5e similar results were obtained for sitagliptin and cetirizine biodegradation on the other hand could be confirmed for citalopram due to the formation of desmethyl citalopram and for gabapentin due to the formation of gabapentin lactam both precursor substances showed an increased removal with increased residence time in both second stages s1 and s2 and for citalopram a removal could only be achieved after aeration for gabapentin an increased removal was observed with increasing ebct recently henning et al 2018 observed an enhanced biodegradability of gabapentin under oxic conditions and identified gabapentin lactam as its major tp in sbf partial removal of gabapentin and a slight formation of its tp was also observed in column a see fig 5f in the sbf trains a s1 and a s2 however equal tp concentrations could be detected in the effluents of the column trains despite further removal of gabapentin as a consequence the mass balance was incomplete in all cases with only 15 of the initial summed concentration left showing that either the tp was removed during treatment or that other not analysed tps were formed these results indicate that although in tendency the removal in sum was higher in a s2 than in a s1 redox conditions besides ebct played an important role for an efficient removal of certain torcs the concentrations of torcs such as the insect repellent deet caffeine and valsartan could be efficiently reduced already in column a while for others such as mecoprop and citalopram the longest ebct was essential to achieve a removal of higher than 70 these results emphasize the importance of studying the behaviour of a larger number of torcs to identify suitable indicators for process evaluation 3 3 comparative assessment of fate and removal in sat more than 70 torcs were detected in the feed water to the infiltration basin with concentrations up to 9 0 μg l oxypurinol similar to the sbf system oxypurinol showed the highest concentrations of all torcs studied additional four substances were detected at concentrations exceeding 1 0 μg l which also were amongst the highest concentrations found in the feed water of the sbf system sucralose 7 4 μg l hydrochlorothiazide 1 7 μg l acesulfame 1 7 μg l and valsartan acid 1 6 μg l in comparison to the sbf system which was fed with municipal wwtp effluent from an urban sewershed pesticides were detected at higher frequency and higher concentrations in the feed water of the sat system located in a spanish rural area particularly substances being used as algicides i e diuron terbutryn and irgarol were found at elevated concentrations the system was operated in an area impacted by agricultural activities adjacent to the wwtp and the infiltration site furthermore the site was located close to the mediterranean sea and a small marina was close by thus the detected pesticides might have reached the sampled water by urban run off and leaching the overall removal of all detected torcs in the sat system grouped by their charge at ph 7 fig 3b showed a clearly better removal of positively charged and zwitterionic torcs compared to neutral and negatively charged ones for the latter two groups the attenuation ranged from no removal at all to a good removal of more than 70 while the positively charged torcs could be attenuated nearly completely and the zwitterionic ones up to 100 the concentrations and removal values are illustrated in table 2 for selected torcs with feed water concentration at least 10 times the loq and fig 6 for all detected torcs respectively for concentrations and removal of all torcs see si table si3 the hrt in the sat system was comparable to the sbf system hrt of sat 1 compared to column system a s2 for all substances detected it can be assumed that the major removal occurred during travel through the vadose zone to the first observation well sat 1 the groundwater passage to reach sat 2 had only minor additional improvement of torc removal by measurements of oxygen in the sampled water of sat 1 it could be observed that oxic conditions prevailed in the vadose zone and the concentrations of about 60 of all detected torcs decreased during the soil passage it is noteworthy that the studied sat site was in operation for only three years demoware 2016 prior to the sampling campaign and that the infiltration was not continuously operated during this period baumgarten et al 2011 reported that adaptation for the microbial community to remove certain torcs such as sulfamethoxazole might take up to several years with longer operation time the biodegradation of certain torcs might improve thirty of the non charged torcs were present in the feed water of these 11 torcs exhibited removal efficiencies of higher than 30 in sat 2 after 72 h of retention time while none were removed by more than 80 several torcs were neither removed during sat nor during sbf e g carbamazepine lamotrigine and oxazepam since they are neither biodegradable nor having elevated sorption affinities to soil aquifer particles hydrochlorothiazide was detected at elevated concentrations in the feed water of both systems 3 0 μg l 10 nmol l in sbf 1 5 μg l 5 nmol l in sat in contrast to sbf a removal of hydrochlorothiazide was observed during sat 25 35 while the concentrations of the tp chlorothiazide doubled during soil passage for the total concentrations of hydrochlorothiazide and chlorothiazide see si figure si4g a clear decrease and an incomplete mass balance were observed during sat the sweetener sucralose also was found at elevated concentrations in both systems 5 μg l for both neither in sbf nor in sat a removal was achieved scheurer et al 2009 studied the occurrence of sweeteners in wastewater and after sat in wwtps only a minor removal was observed and at an sat site even a travel time of more than a month did not support removal of sucralose by more than 50 indicating the high mobility and elevated persistence of the artificial sweetener based on sucralose measurements dilution with native groundwater in sat 1 and sat 2 can be characterized as 5 and 15 respectively the antithrombotic agent clopidogrel was detected at very low concentrations 0 001 μg l 0 01 nmol l in both systems a removal of more than 70 was observed the metabolite clopidogrel carboxylic acid zwitterionic at ph 7 was detected at concentrations of around 0 10 μg l 0 24 nmol l in the feed water of both systems in contrast to sbf a removal efficiency of higher than 90 was found in sat see si figure si4h the positively charged site of the zwitter ion might have a major influence on the removal in soil as explained later in this section similar to the sbf system iopromide was degraded but other tps were detected fig 5c while in sat mainly tps were found which are formed in the last reactions of the described transformation pathways e g tp 701a and tp 643 after sbf mainly tps were found which are formed at the beginning of the transformation pathway the most obvious difference was the formation of the final tp 643 during sat in sbf iopromide was spiked into the feed water to follow its degradation process whereas in the feed water of the sat system only the iopromide tps were detected thus no further formation of the early stage tps occurred in sat in contrast to sbf but a further transformation of already formed tps towards the final iopromide tp 643 the herbicides algicides diuron terbutryn and irgarol were detected with concentrations of around 0 10 μg l in the feed water of the sat system all three herbicides were removed by about 50 during the soil passage stasinakis et al 2009 and luft et al 2014 already showed the biodegradability of these substances in wwtps under oxic conditions they also identified tps for all three substances however these tps were not included into the monitoring campaign of this study except for two diuron tps which were detected at low concentrations 0 01 μg l after sat of the negatively charged torcs 20 compounds were detected in the feed water of these 12 torcs were reduced in concentration either by transformation or sorption by more than 30 in sat 2 four even above 90 in both systems sat and sbf oxypurinol was detected at elevated concentrations 9 μg l it was frequently detected in water samples at this concentration range and was stable during wastewater treatment funke et al 2015 it is a highly mobile substance and can thus reach drinking water wells in the sbf system no removal at all was observed for oxypurinol indicating its persistence in biological processes in the sat system a minor change of the concentrations approx 20 during soil passage sat 1 and an overall removal of 40 in sat 2 was observed which is higher than expected from the limited bio degradability reported by funke et al 2015 diclofenac was removed by more than 80 in sat in sbf its reduction was negligible and only a slight formation of its tp diclofenac carboxylate jewell et al 2016b was observed in sat no tps were found neither in the feed water nor after soil passage rühmland et al 2015 observed a removal of diclofenac by photodegradation in in situ degradation experiments and muntau et al 2017 confirmed this at a full scale sat site in northern germany during the sampling campaign for this study samples of the feed water were taken at the pumping station prior to the basin thus it cannot be ruled out that photodegradation occurred in the basin where feed water was exposed to sunlight during operation the observed removal for diclofenac is also in accordance with other sat studies he et al 2016 laws et al 2011 muntau et al 2017 the compounds of the sartan group showed a very different behaviour to each other during soil passage while valsartan was removed very well in both systems irbesartan and telmisartan indicated a moderate to good removal during sat but were stable in sbf olmesartan and candesartan remained stable in both systems in both sbf and sat the concentrations of the tp valsartan acid were reduced see fig 5d neither nödler et al 2013 nor kern et al 2010 observed a removal of valsartan acid in bank filtration and in sludge treatment sorption effects in sat seem to be unlikely due to the very low log d value 1 and thus it is assumed that removal in sat was due to biological degradation as it was also observed during sbf the sweetener acesulfame was detected at concentrations 1 5 μg l in both systems in contrast to the good removal in sbf no removal was observed during sat contradictory results have also been observed in literature showing elevated removal castronovo et al 2017 as well as persistent behaviour jekel et al 2015 of acesulfame in sand filtration and managed aquifer recharge systems the persistent behaviour in some systems including the investigated sat site might be explained by a lack of an adopted microbial community appropriate for degradation of acesulfame in total 24 torcs detected in the feed water were positively charged or zwitterionic all of them showed a removal of higher than 80 in sat 2 except for six torcs which were removed between 30 and 80 in contrast to the sbf system gabapentin was not efficiently removed in sat for its tp gabapentin lactam non charged compound the same behaviour was observed both substances exhibited a removal of only up to 35 see also fig 5f tramadol and venlafaxine as well as their metabolites tps were efficiently removed to more than 80 for tramadol mass balance see fig 5e during sbf removal was only observed for venlafaxine at longer ebcts however other studies also showed an efficient removal of these compounds in column experiments hellauer et al 2018b 2019 considering that also the other positively charged torcs showed a similar behaviour and no tps were detected sorption by ionic interactions i e cation exchange might be a plausible reason for the elevated removal during sat the importance of cation exchange as an attenuation process in sat systems is already described by he et al 2016 but so far it was only reported for a small number of torcs here in total 33 positively charged torcs 18 of these could be detected in the feed water of the sat system and eight zwitterionic substances six detected in the feed water showed a similar removal behaviour these results in combination with the fact that no major tps from these substances could be detected in this nor in other studies support the assumption of a removal by sorption probably due to cation exchange during soil passage 3 4 direct comparison of removal in sbf and sat in this study two different treatment systems an engineered above ground biological system sbf and a natural below ground soil passage system sat were studied the removal of a broad set of torcs and tps with different physico chemical properties was utilized for water quality evaluation for the sbf system redox conditions changed from oxic to suboxic by adjusting the hrt while in the sat system oxic conditions prevailed for the direct comparison of results from sat and sbf systems in fig 7 treatment options sat 1 and a s2 were chosen due to comparable hrts approximately 70 torcs were detected in the feed water of both systems by classification of the removal results process based indicator chemicals can be deduced meeting the following criteria persistent removal 30 moderate removal 30 70 and good removal 70 these classes are highlighted by blue boxes in fig 7 furthermore two areas of torcs with a completely different behaviour are marked as red boxes the compounds in blue boxes represent candidates for process evaluation of natural and biological treatment systems as they show consistent behaviour in both systems several torcs which are known to be persistent in conventional wwtps declared as stable in fig 7 were also found to be persistent in sbf and sat amongst these were carbamazepine and candesartan but also human metabolites tps such as 10 11 dihydroxy carbamazepine in the group of moderately removable torcs the tp valsartan acid can be found together with emtricitabine and furosemide an elevated removal was observed in both systems for 10 torcs such as valsartan fexofenadine and citalopram probably due to biological degradation however no single dominant transformation of specific compound moieties was observed rather removal could be partly attributed to different transformation reactions such as hydrogenation dehydrogenation amide hydrolysis and demethylation climbazole for example is transformed by the reduction hydrogenation of the keto function to an alcohol moiety brienza and chiron 2017 while for fexofenadine oxidation dehydrogenation of the secondary alcohol to a keto moiety can be assumed henning et al 2019 amide hydrolysis is involved in the transformations of atenolol to atenolol acid and valsartan to valsartan acid helbling et al 2010 trimethoprim has been stated to be degraded by demethylation of a methoxy group followed by hydroxylation and oxidation jewell et al 2016a consistently in literature these mechanisms were found to proceed rather fast however no generalized conclusion about a dependency between specific compound moieties and the degradation efficiency in both systems can be drawn aliskiren for example contains a primary amide which might be expected to hydrolyse quickly as found for atenolol however no removal could be observed in sbf similarly acyclovir was degraded in sbf to more than 90 and the formation of acyclovir acid confirmed the proposed mechanism of oxidation of primary alcohols prasse et al 2011 in sat removal of acyclovir was very low with about 30 during the sampling campaign a considerable higher removal in sbf compared to sat was also observed for deet which has been reported to be transformed by a dealkylation of the tertiary amine and an oxidation of the methyl moiety helbling et al 2010 further examples for inconsistent behaviour in sat and sbf are acesulfame and gabapentin which is in accordance with a high variability of degradation reported in literature burke et al 2018 henning et al 2018 storck et al 2015 for all compounds with at least partly positively charged amine moieties at ambient ph e g tramadol venlafaxine sitagliptin and denatonium a considerable higher removal was observed in sat however while removal of individual compounds such as venlafaxine and tramadol might also be attributed to biodegradation the consistent behaviour of 18 detected positively charged and zwitterionic compounds supports the assumption of cation exchange as an additional removal mechanism in summary it was found that no generalized moiety specific conclusion could be drawn on the underlying attenuation mechanisms and emphasizes the need of a multi compound method applied in this study based on fig 7 a list of possible candidates for indicator substances are proposed in table 3 grouping torcs with a similar behaviour in both studied sbf and sat or a completely contrary behaviour nevertheless for all proposed torcs their occurrence needs to be confirmed to choose them as site specific indicator substances 4 conclusions based on the occurrence and removal of more than 100 torcs human metabolites and transformation products in two different biological treatment systems a sequential biofiltration system with dominant compound removal by biodegradation and a soil aquifer treatment system with hrt of a few days where also sorption and dilution effects are relevant the following conclusions can be drawn in both systems human metabolites and environmental tps were sometimes detected in higher concentrations than the precursors e g clopidogrel acid via clopidogrel since certain tps exhibit a higher polarity and are rather persistent they should be considered when designing monitoring concepts for process evaluation both systems demonstrated their capability as effective treatment steps since attenuation in sbf is only achieved by biodegradation removal efficiency depends on redox conditions and hrt while non biodegradable torcs will always persist in sat a combination of biotransformation and sorption effects was able to remove a broader set of torcs however the efficiency depends on site characteristics for example soil properties or the adaption stage of the microbial community in addition torcs breakthrough might occur after longer operation periods triggering the need for long term monitoring of potentially sorbed substances as removal capacities in the soil are mostly unknown results confirmed that the analysis of parent compounds and their major tps provides an efficient measure to understand driving removal mechanisms in natural and biological systems increased tp concentration in effluents or monitoring wells confirmed biodegradation as a major mechanism for neutral e g climbazole iopromide and negatively charged valsartan compounds the selection of a large range of different torcs revealed additional information while most positively charged compounds were persistent in sbf consistently good removal was observed in sat indicating cation exchange as major removal mechanism a selection of performance based indicator chemicals and tps must be adapted to site specific conditions and should contain representatives of the following criteria 1 torcs with different physico chemical properties at environmental ph 7 9 i non charged ii positively charged iii negatively charged iv zwitterionic 2 torcs with different removal degrees removal by transformation processes or sorption i good removal 70 ii moderate removal 30 70 iii persistent 30 3 torcs with feed water concentrations of more than 10 times the loq 4 pairs of precursor substances and their major human metabolites and tps furthermore the location of the treatment site and thus the likelihood of the appearance of substance classes e g pharmaceuticals or pesticides has to be considered for instance different torcs were present in urban sbf and rural sat areas therefore a pre monitoring of

18596,alkaline especially ph 10 anaerobic fermentation of waste activated sludge was has been reported to be an effective approach for hydrogen production through inhibiting the homoacetogenesis and methanogenesis however the potential effect of the widespread microplastics in sludge on the performance of hydrogen production has never been reported to fill this knowledge gap the dominant polyethylene terephthalate pet microplastics in was were selected as the model microplastics to evaluate their influences on hydrogen production during alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was as well as the key mechanisms involved experimental results demonstrated that hydrogen production from was decreased in the presence of pet microplastics i e 10 30 and 60 particles g ts compared to the control with the hydrogen yield at 60 particles g ts being only 70 7 0 9 of the control although the hydrogen consumption i e homoacetogenesis and methanogenesis was restrained under alkaline ph 10 condition pet microplastics inhibited hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis in alkaline was anaerobic fermentation leading to the inhibitory effect on hydrogen production this was further confirmed by the microbial analysis which clearly showed pet microplastics caused the shift of the microbial community toward the direction against hydrolysis acidification mechanism studies revealed that pet microplastics carried on their negative influence mainly through leaching the toxic di n butyl phthalate dbp the reactive oxygen species ros and live dead staining tests indicated that the increased ros was induced by pet microplastics causing more cells dead which further resulted in the decreased production of hydrogen graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastics polyethylene terephthalate anaerobic fermentation hydrogen production waste activated sludge 1 introduction the emission of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels at a life threatening rate is causing global warming the rapid transition away from fossil fuels to a clean energy is currently in the great need hydrogen is widely viewed as an attractive renewable replacement because it creates enormous energy 286 kj mol with at least 2 75 times as much as hydrocarbons and produces water rather than carbon dioxide when burning cai et al 2004 recently biological production of hydrogen by anaerobic fermentation of organic wastes has attracted increasing attentions ueno et al 2007 valdez vazquez et al 2006 wang et al 2019 waste activated sludge was the major by product in biological wastewater treatment process is rich in organic substrates e g protein and carbohydrate wei et al 2018 which has been demonstrated to be a promising fermentation feedstock for hydrogen production cai et al 2004 turner 2004 zhao and chen 2011 with the conversion of was to hydrogen the fossil fuels are saved and the sludge is reduced thereby providing environmental and economic benefits simultaneously the hydrogen production from anaerobic fermentation of was generally goes through four stages hydrolysis acidification acetogenesis and hydrogen consumption wang et al 2018a usually the hydrogen yield is rather low 1 8 ml h2 g dried sludge due to the low hydrolysis efficiency and the rapid hydrogen consumption wang et al 2018c most previous studies in literature therefore focused on optimizing sludge pretreatment methods e g acidic alkaline sterilization ultrasonic and heat to enhance sludge hydrolysis and or inhibit hydrogen consumption oh et al 2003 wong et al 2014 xiao and liu 2009 among them recent studies confirmed that the hydrogen yield from was can be remarkably improved by anaerobic fermentation under constant alkaline i e ph 10 condition via the improvement of sludge hydrolysis and acidification and the inhibition of homoacetogenesis by acetobacteria zhao et al 2010 microplastics that are defined as synthetic polymers with the size 5 mm mahon et al 2017 have countless applications in consumer products such as cosmetic and personal care products medical supplies and industrial abrasives alimi et al 2018 browne et al 2011 wang et al 2018b the global utilization and skyrocketing production of microparticles inevitably results in a huge amount of these commercial microplastics entering the environment which is threatening the ecosystem schwarzenbach et al 2006 seidensticker et al 2017 wang et al 2018b laboratory based toxicological studies have identified the adverse impacts of microplastics on microorganisms bhattacharya et al 2010 wei et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 plankton cole et al 2015 lee et al 2013 blue mussel browne et al 2008 von moos et al 2012 bryozoans and arthropods gall and thompson 2015 microplastics have been documented to have capability of impacting key physiological functions such as energy metabolism respiration assimilation efficiency growth reproduction and survival cole et al 2016 gardon et al 2018 lu et al 2016 for example pinctada margaritifera showed the reduced assimilation efficiency energetic reserves and fecundity when exposed to commercial microbeads gardon et al 2018 the toxicity of microplastics might be associated with the chemical additives leached e silva et al 2016 li et al 2015 wei et al 2019 which were used to improve microplastic product properties lithner et al 2011 for example the chemical additives leaching from microplastics at the concentrations of 0 50 m2 l significantly increased the mortality of amphibalanus amphitrite li et al 2015 in addition the reactive oxygen species ros induced by microplastics was also found to be toxic to cells thereby causing the loss of cell viability bhattacharya et al 2010 jeong et al 2016 wastewater treatment plant wwtp has been identified as an important receptor of the discharged microplastics capturing the 95 99 of microplastics in the activated sludge via adsorption and aggregation carr et al 2016 murphy et al 2016 the partitioning of microplastics through the settling process results in that the majority of microplastics would be entrained in was li et al 2018 these microplastics in was might then pose significant effects on the biological treatment process of was through affecting the microorganisms involved as such the effective hydrogen production from alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was is very likely to be affected by the microplastics entrained in was however to the best of our knowledge so far the potential influence of the microplastics in sludge on the performance of hydrogen production from alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was has never been reported therefore the objective of this study was to investigate the impacts of microplastics on hydrogen production from anaerobic fermentation of was under alkaline condition i e using ph 10 as efficient strategy for enhancing hydrogen accumulation the most common microplastics in sludge are polyethylene terephthalate pet microplastics which are also a large class of microplastics detected in was due to their global ubiquity li et al 2018 sun et al 2019 thus pet microplastics were selected as the model microplastics to be evaluated in this work the impacts of pet microplastics on each step involved in hydrogen production and consumption were specifically investigated the diversities of microbial community in long term was anaerobic fermentation system exposed to pet microplastics were also examined in addition the mechanisms of pet microplastics affecting hydrogen production from alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was were explored through analyzing the toxic leachates and ros generation 2 materials and methods 2 1 was and pet microplastics the was used in this study was collected from the secondary sedimentation tank of a wwtp in shanghai china the collected sludge was concentrated by settling for 1 d and stored at 4 c before use the main characteristics of the was were listed in table 1 in the was various typical microplastics were identified and enumerated using the methods described in the analytical methods section five typical microplastics pet polyvinyl chloride pvc polyethylene pe polystyrene ps and polypropylene pp were detected among these microplastics pet microplastic was determined to be the dominant microplastics in was with the content of 2 1 1 1 particles g ts hence it was selected as the model microplastic to explore the influences on hydrogen production from was during alkaline anaerobic fermentation the morphology and size of all collected pet microplastics in the was were visually examined under a motic microscope ba410e motic electric group xiamen china with the axiocam 506 color digital camera then the average size was measured using oplenic software according the morphology characteristics of pet microplastics in the was the same pet microplastics sphere average size 25 2 μm density 1 4 g cm3 cas number 25038 59 9 were purchased and used in this study 2 2 influences of pet microplastics on hydrogen production from alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was the environmentally relevant concentration of pet microplastics was in the range of 1 60 particles g ts li et al 2018 therefore three levels 10 30 and 60 particles g ts of pet microplastics were used to investigate the impacts of pet microplastics on hydrogen production from was fermentation in this work the 1440 ml of raw was from one sampling were collected fully mixed and divided into four groups one group with the background pet microplastics level of 2 1 particles g ts was served as control note that besides pet microplastics the raw was might also contains other pollutants such as heavy metals persistent organic pollutants pops and other typical microplastics this control would account for the potential presence of various contaminants in raw was representing the hydrogen production from the raw was with various pollutants here we used pet microplastics at the concentrations of 10 30 and 60 particles g ts with equivalent mass dose of 0 09 0 32 and 0 66 mg g ts respectively supporting information table s1 thus the corresponding mass of pet microplastics were dosed using weighing paper in the other three was groups which resulted in the pet microplastics level of 10 30 and 60 particles g ts respectively the hydrogen potential tests were performed in four series of replicate serum bottles with the working volume of 400 m l each each bottle received 360 ml of the raw was or was with 10 30 and 60 pet particles g ts and 40 ml of the inocula that was withdrawn from a sludge anaerobic digester in our laboratory the ph value of sludge in each bottle was adjusted to 10 0 using hydrochloric acid hcl 4 mol l or sodium hydroxide naoh 4 mol l after flushing with nitrogen gas for around 2 min to ensure anaerobic condition each bottle was sealed by a rubber stopper with aluminum crimp cap and placed in an air bath shaker 120 rpm 37 1 c blank was also set up which contained 360 ml of tap water instead of the raw was and 40 ml of inocula during the whole fermentation process the ph value in each bottle was controlled at 10 0 by adding 4 mol l hcl or naoh with an automatic titrator for enhancing hydrogen accumulation from was zhao et al 2010 the methane generation could be completely inhibited at constant ph 10 0 yuan et al 2006 all tests were conducted in triplicate and lasted for around 21 d until the hydrogen production decreased to a negligible level the biogas i e h2 co2 and n2 production and composition were monitored periodically over the whole test periods the biogas production from was were obtained by subtracting biogas production from blank the hydrogen production from was were reported as the volume of hydrogen produced per gram of vs added ml h2 g vs added 2 3 influences of pet microplastics on hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis homoacetogenesis and methonogenesis processes sludge anaerobic fermentation generally undergoes several bio processes such as hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis homoacetogenesis and methonogenesis which collectively affect hydrogen production was hydrolysis is consider as the major rate limiting step in sludge anaerobic fermentation hydrogen is produced in the acidogenesis and acetogenesis steps while the generated hydrogen can be consumed in the homoacetogenesis and methonogenesis processes to evaluate the impacts of pet microplastics on each step involved in hydrogen production and consumption a series of batch tests were carried out using the model substrates in the literature mu and chen 2011 wang et al 2019 hydrolysis test the soluble protein and polysaccharide in the was is hydrolyzed at this first step to investigate the effects of pet microplastics on the hydrolysis of was the following batch tests with synthetic wastewater containing bovine serum albumin bsa model protein compound and dextran model polysaccharide compound were carried out all operations were the same as described in the influences of pet microplastics on hydrogen production from alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was section except that the was were replaced with synthetic wastewater containing bsa and dextran the synthetic wastewater was composed of mg l of tap water 1000 kh2po4 600 mgcl2 6h2o 400 cacl2 100 fecl3 1 0 nicl2 6h2o 0 5 znso4 7h2o 0 5 cocl2 6h2o 0 5 cuso4 5h2o and 0 5 mncl2 4h2o then 4 g l of bsa and 1 g l of dextran were added to the synthetic wastewater and dissolved the mass ratio of bsa and dextran was almost the same as that of protein and carbohydrate in was each test lasted for 4 d by determining the degradation of bsa and dextran the impacts of pet microplastics at the studied levels i e 10 30 and 60 particles g ts on hydrolysis process of was could be assessed acidogenesis test the amino acid and monosaccharide are the main products from was hydrolysis as such this test was conducted with the same operations described in the hydrolysis test section except that the model substrates i e bsa and dextran were replaced with 4 g l of glutamate model amino acid compound and 1 g l of glucose model monosaccharide compound acetogenesis test during acetogenesis process the butyric acid is converted to acetic acid the same operations were performed when the influences of pet microplastics on the acetogenesis process were evaluated except that the synthetic wastewater containing 4 g l of sodium butyrate homoacetogenesis and methonogenesis test during these two steps hydrogen and carbon dioxide are consumed to generate acetic acid and methane in this set of tests each serum bottle received 360 ml of the tap water with pet microplastics at the studied levels and 40 ml of the inocula during the entire test process the ph value in each bottle was controlled at ph 10 0 all bottles were sealed and placed in an air bath shaker 120 rpm 37 1 c when the hydrogen production did not increase with time the acetic acid concentration was measured and recorded then all bottles were flushed and filled with a combined gas 40 h2 10 co2 and 50 n2 all bottles were operated for anaerobic fermentation again for 2 d the volume of hydrogen and methane as well as the production of acetic acid were determined by analyzing and comparing the consumption of hydrogen and the productions of acetic acid and methane among these cases the effects of pet microplastics on homoacetogenesis and methonogenesis could be evaluated 2 4 influences of pet microplastics on microbial community in long term continuous operation of anaerobic fermentation reactor to further understand the long term effects of pet microplastics on alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was from the aspect of microbial community two lab scale anaerobic fermenters were operated continuously until reaching stable i e 80 d the two fermenters were replicate with a working volume of 1 l each both fermenters were continually mixed using magnetic stirrers 120 rmp the temperature in each fermenter was maintained at 37 1 c using a temperature controlled water jacket and ph was controlled at 10 0 by adding 4 mol l hcl or naoh with an automatic titrator after inoculation with 100 ml of inocula one fermenter as the control was fed with 900 ml raw was the other fermenter was fed with 900 ml was containing 60 particles pet microplastics g ts during the continuous operation 67 ml fermentation mixture was withdrawn every day and the same amount of the raw was or was with 60 particles pet microplastics g ts was fed resulting in a sludge retention time of 15 d the two anaerobic systems were operated continuously for 80 days more than 5 hrts until both fermenters reached stable stages then the sludge samples from the two fermenters were obtained to analyze the microbial communities using illumina miseq sequencing more details about the microbial community analysis were in supporting information si 2 5 determination of the chemicals leached from pet microplastics and the corresponding influences on hydrogen production according to the manufacturers the only plastic additive added during pet processing is di n butyl phthalate dbp which is accounting for 6 of pet microplastics to determine the corresponding concentrations of dbp leached from pet microplastics at the studied levels i e 10 30 and 60 particles g ts three levels of pet microplastics were respectively dosed in the three serum bottles with the mixture of the raw was 360 ml and the inocula 40 ml each all other operations were the same as the hydrogen potential tests above at different fermentation time i e 0 5 10 15 and 20 d the mixture samples were withdrawn and the concentrations of dbp leached were measured using the method detailed in the analytical methods section below the experiments of leachate i e dbp from pet microplastics affecting hydrogen production from was fermentation were then conducted with the same method described above except that the three studied levels of pet microplastics i e 10 30 and 60 particles g ts was replaced by the corresponding concentrations of dbp determined 2 6 determination of the ros generated from pet microplastics and the corresponding impacts on live dead microorganisms to explore the influences of pet microplastics on ros generation and the viability of microorganisms in the alkaline anaerobic fermenter the tests were performed with the same operations described in the influences of pet microplastics on hydrogen production from alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was section above after the fermentation for 21 d the mixture in each test was withdrawn then the ros level was measured and the live dead microorganisms were counted as detailed in the analytical methods section below 2 7 analytical methods the determination of ts vs and tcod were achieved according to standard methods dai et al 2017 protein and carbohydrate were measured using the bca bicinchoninic acid method and phenol sulfuric acid method respectively raunkjaer et al 1994 smith et al 1985 the detection procedure of various microplastics in raw was was divided into three steps sludge collection and pretreatment microplastic identification and quantification as detailed in si the ph value was monitored by the ph meter tps minichem the volume of biogas produced during the alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was was determined by a manometer based on the headspace gas pressure of the serum bottle the composition of biogas was analyzed using a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector gc tcd the hydrogen production was calculated based on the biogas volume and the hydrogen percentage the concentration of glutamate was determined according to the method described by darmaun et al 1985 the vfas e g acetic and butyric acids was measured using a gas chromatograph agilent fid with polar capillary column the detection limit was 1 mg l the carrier gas was nitrogen with the flow rate of 50 ml min the temperature of detector was 280 c the program of gc oven 50 c for 2 min then increase to 280 c 10 c min for 2 min the dbp leached from pet microplastics were extracted and analyzed by gc ms saturn 2000 varian using the method detailed in si more detailed information about ros measurement and live dead staining test also can be found in si independent samples t test was used to evaluate significant differences a value of p 0 05 was considered insignificant whereas a value of p 0 05 was considered significant in this work 3 results and discussion 3 1 influences of pet microplastics on hydrogen production from alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was the curves of the cumulative hydrogen yields from alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was with the different levels of pet microplastics were reported in fig 1 in the control the level of pet microplastics was the background concentration of 2 1 particles g ts in the raw was table 1 besides pet microplastics the control account for the potential presence of other contaminants e g heavy metals pops and other typical microplastics in raw was overall the hydrogen production from the raw was potentially with various pollutants gradually increased during the initial 19 d and then remained stable afterwards the maximal hydrogen production in the control was 24 7 0 9 ml g vs which was much higher than those reported in the literatures cai et al 2004 massanet nicolau et al 2008 ting and lee 2007 wang et al 2003 2018a 2018c xiao and liu 2009 demonstrating that alkaline ph 10 0 anaerobic fermentation is indeed an effective strategy for enhancing hydrogen production this result was consistent with previous result zhao et al 2010 however it was observed clearly that the presence of extra pet microplastics in the raw was at the studied levels i e 10 30 and 60 particles g ts significantly paired sample t test p 3 76e 05 8 42e 06 3 25e 06 inhibited the hydrogen productions from was throughout the 21 d test period increased pet microplastics levels resulted in decreased hydrogen production compared to the control the maximal hydrogen productions from was with pet microplastics of 10 30 and 60 particles g ts was 21 8 0 7 20 1 0 8 and 17 4 0 7 ml g vs representing the relative decreases of 11 6 0 1 18 4 0 1 and 29 3 0 1 respectively the reasons for the was with 10 30 and 60 particles g ts of pet microplastics producing significantly independent samples t test p 0 03 0 01 0 006 lower hydrogen than the raw was were addressed in the following text 3 2 influences of pet microplastics on each step involved in hydrogen production and consumption hydrogen production from was during alkaline anaerobic fermentation is generally related to several bio processes such as hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis homoacetogenesis and methonogenesis it is necessary to explore the effect of pet microplastics on each process for fully understand of the pet microplastic role in the whole anaerobic process these processes generally co occur in was fermentation systems thus the model substrates in the literature wang et al 2018c were used for evaluation the impacts of pet microplastics at the studied levels i e 10 30 and 60 particles g ts on the was hydrolysis was investigated with bsa and dextran as model protein and polysaccharide and the results were shown in fig 2 a the degradations of bsa and dextran in the control were 46 3 1 5 and 71 2 1 3 whereas pet microplastics at the studied levels i e 10 30 and 60 particles g ts restrained both bsa and dextran degradations with the highest decreases being approximately 20 3 0 1 from 46 3 1 5 to 36 9 1 2 and 13 2 0 1 from 71 2 1 3 to 61 8 1 1 respectively achieved at 60 pet particles g ts this result suggested that the presence of pet microplastics in was had the adverse effects on the hydrolysis of both protein and polysaccharide which reduced the availability of substrates for acidification thereby producing less hydrogen consequentially zhao et al 2010 fig 2b presented the influences of different concentrations of pet microplastics on the acidogenesis of main hydrolyzed products i e amino acid and monosaccharide to produce vfas and hydrogen the presence of pet microplastics reduced the degradation of glutamate and glucose the higher the pet microplastics levels the lower the degradations of glutamate and glucose as pet microplastics concentrations increasing from 10 to 60 particles g ts the degradations of glutamate during fermentation decreased from 92 7 0 1 to 82 2 0 2 of the control similarly the lowest glucose degradation 67 5 2 1 was obtained at 60 particles g ts of pet microplastics which was 11 6 2 1 lower than that in the control apart from acidogenesis hydrogen can be generated in the acetogenesis process accompanied the conversion of butyric acid to acetic acid similar results were also obtained as the effects of pet microplastics on the acetogenesis fig 2c the butyrate degradations decreased gradually from 19 6 0 7 to 17 4 0 4 with the increase of pet microplastics dosage from 0 to 20 particles g ts which decreased significantly p 0 03 to 16 2 0 9 when further increasing pet microplastics to 60 particles g ts all these results strongly revealed that pet microplastics would suppress hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis processes that related to hydrogen generation leading to the lower hydrogen production during was fermentation the produced hydrogen as metabolic intermediate can be further consumed to generate methane and acetic acid in homoacetogenesis and methonogenesis processes however after hydrogen filling there were very low hydrogen consumption only 1 0 in all cases and no significant p 0 05 changes in the production of acetic acid were observed for both control and experimental tests fig 2d in addition no methane was detected in each case these results suggested that both homoacetogenesis and methanogenesis were completely inhibited by alkaline ph 10 0 condition already in despite of the presence of pet microplastics which was in accordance with the previous study zhao et al 2010 3 3 influences of pet microplastics on microbial community in long term continuous operation of fermentation reactor to further understand the effect of pet microplastics on anaerobic microbes the two long term continuous anaerobic fermentation reactors fed with raw was as control or was containing 60 particles pet microplastics g ts as experimental were operated to assess the change of microbial community after exposure to pet microplastics rarefaction curves of both samples fig 3 a nearly reached saturation indicating that the sequencing depth had effectively captured the whole microbial species in the samples alpha diversity results in fig 3b showed that shannon 5 61 0 02 and chao 740 12 indices in the control were similar p 0 59 and 0 18 with those 5 64 0 03 729 6 in the experimental group revealing that the presence of pet microplastics did not significantly affect the microbial diversity taxonomic abundance scenarios in the two fermentation reactors fig 3c displayed the distributions of microbial populations at the phylum level firmicutes actinobacteria proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the dominant microbial populations in both control and experimental reactors accounting for 68 5 76 7 of the total microbial community many microbes in these four phyla were known as hydrocarbon degraders for producing vfas and hydrogen which were generally abundant in various anaerobic habitats ariesyady et al 2007 wang et al 2018a zheng et al 2013 compared to those of the control the abundances of firmicutes actinobacteria and bacteroidetes in the experimental reactor significantly p 0 04 0 05 and 0 02 decreased by 12 2 0 1 20 5 0 1 and 29 6 0 2 respectively fig 3d this suggested that the presence of pet microplastics decreased the biodegradability of organic compounds further exploration at the genus level see fig 3e found that the presence of pet microplastics caused obvious decreases in the abundances of most anaerobes relevant to hydrogen production for example the bacteroides sp as a kind of hydrolytic bacteria wang et al 2018a was detected to occupy 2 1 0 1 and 1 6 0 1 abundances in the control and experimental reactors respectively representing a significant decrease p 0 019 of 23 8 0 1 similarly tissierella sp and fonticella sp which have been documented to generate vfas and hydrogen during anaerobic degradation of organic substrates wang et al 2017 2018a were also less abundant in the experimental reactor than the control p 0 014 and 0 039 expectedly the extremely low abundances of methanogens i e methanosaeta sp and methanobacterium sp and homoacetogenic bacteria i e acetoanaerobium sp were observed in both reactors confirming that alkaline ph 10 0 condition did almost completely inhibit homoacetogenesis and methanogenesis overall the presence of pet microplastics decreased the abundances of key hydrogen producers in alkaline was anaerobic fermentation significantly which was consistent with the lower hydrogen production observed in the testing with 60 particles pet microplastics g ts 3 4 mechanisms of pet microplastics affecting hydrogen production from alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was as demonstrated above the presence of pet microplastics at the studied levels i e 10 30 and 60 particles g ts reduced hydrogen yield from alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was via the inhibition of hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis as well as the shift of the microbial community toward the direction against hydrolysis acidification which led to a key question why such influences occurred the potential mechanisms of pet microplastics affecting hydrogen production were thus explored to answer this question first chemical additives could migrate from the microplastics due to their relatively low molecular weight resulting in the microplastics toxicity on microorganisms suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 reported that the additives keep leaching from microplastics during several months and the leaching rate did not significantly decrease with time however the microplastics were accumulated in was through urban wastewater treatment within a relatively short period e g within one month thus the additives leached from microplastics are likely to have an effect on was treatment system in this work the dbp was identified as the only prominent leachate from pet microplastics which was consistent with previous study suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 fig 4 a illustrated the corresponding concentrations of dbp leached from different levels of pet microplastics during alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was although a portion of dbp could be potentially absorbed to other particles in was during the leaching process the amounts of dbp leached in the sludge liquor increased gradually with time lapse increased pet microplastics concentrations led to more dbp leached to examine the impacts of dbp leached from pet microplastics on hydrogen production during alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was the hydrogen potential tests were operated with the corresponding concentrations of dbp leached instead of pet microplastics and the results were shown in si fig s1 aligning with the depressing performances of pet microplastics dbp leached also suppressed the hydrogen production and the cumulative hydrogen yields decreased with the increase of dbp amounts fig 4b compared the effects of different levels of pet microplastics i e 10 30 and 60 particles g ts and the corresponding dbp leached on the hydrogen production during alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was the hydrogen productions from was with pet microplastics of 10 30 and 60 particles g ts was 88 4 1 5 81 6 1 1 and 70 7 1 9 of the control whereas hydrogen productions in the presence of the corresponding dbp leached was 94 4 0 8 90 3 1 7 and 84 5 1 2 of the control respectively thus the toxic dbp leached from pet microplastics should be one contributor for pet microplastics restraining hydrogen production second the ros including the hydrogen peroxide h2o2 the superoxide o2 and the hydroxyl radical oh are known to cause toxic oxidative stress in cells or organisms mu and chen 2011 the production of ros could trigger redox sensitive signaling pathways e g the map kinases and nf kb cascades and disrupt inner membrane electron transfer leading to cytotoxicity and ultimately cellular apoptosis xia et al 2008 xiao et al 2003 microplastics exposure has been shown to up regulate ros production in organisms resulting in the loss of cell viability bhattacharya et al 2010 jeong et al 2016 especially previous studies reported that ros could be generated under anaerobic conditions degli esposti and mclennan 1998 mu and chen 2011 microplastics with the small size have a large surface area which determines a greater proportion of reactive groups to be displayed on the surface donaldson and tran 2002 in the anaerobic system the submicromolar concentrations of oxygen remained in the medium still could react with reduced groups on microplastics thereby producing nanomolar quantities of o2 and h2o2 through dismutation or fenton chemistry degli esposti and mclennan 1998 nel et al 2006 in addition the interaction of the formed h2o2 and reduced iron would produce the additional ros i e oh in this study an increase of the intracellular ros production was observed in the system with the increase of pet microplastics fig 4c with the maximum ros production increased by 23 3 1 9 compared to the control aligning with the ros measurement the results of live dead staining assay revealed that the fractions of the dead cells increased from 17 0 1 1 to 21 6 1 3 when pet microplastics increased from 10 to 30 particles g ts and then increased to 28 9 1 9 when further increasing pet microplastics level to 60 particles g ts whereas the dead cells fraction was only 10 9 0 7 in the control see fig 5 obviously the more pet microplastics presented in sludge the less live cells remained which was in accord with the observed hydrogen production from sludge anaerobic fermentation system exposed to different levels of pet microplastics therefore ros induced by pet microplastics should be another contributor to causing negative effects on hydrogen production during alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was based on the above results and discussion the mechanism for the pet microplastics inhibiting hydrogen production during alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was were concluded although the homoacetogenesis and methanogenesis for hydrogen consumption were suppressed when was was fermented at ph 10 the presence of pet microplastics at the studied levels i e 10 30 and 60 particles g ts negatively influenced hydrolysis acidification processes for hydrogen production the combined impacts of the dbp leached and ros induced by pet microplastics decreased the activity and viability of microorganisms and changed the microbial community in was fermentation reactors toward the direction against hydrolysis acidification leading to the reduced accumulation of hydrogen during alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was 3 5 implications for wastewater and was treatments this study confirmed that the presence of pet microplastics inhibited the hydrogen production during alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was therefore wastewater and was treatment systems need to be improved for reducing amount of microplastic released from was thereby avoiding microplastics entering sludge anaerobic system one optimal solution is to improve the light floating microplastics removal through grease removal stage and enhance the settling of the heavy microplastics during grit removal on primary clarifiers sun et al 2019 yang et al 2019 then the grease and grit need to be treated separately for preventing the removed microplastics entering the was in the aeration tank the remained microplastics in primary effluent can be easily absorbed into sludge flocs the flocculating agents e g ferric sulfate could be used to aid the accumulation of microplastics murphy et al 2016 besides membrane bioreactor mbr rapid sand filtration rsf discfilter df and dissolved air flotation daf also could be employed as microplastics targeted treatment units during the secondary treatment performance talvitie et al 2017 on the other hand a sludge pre treatment unit prior to anaerobic digester should be designed for the removal of the microplastics retained in the was the pyrolysis techniques such as thermal pyrolysis microwave assisted pyrolysis and catalytic pyrolysis undri et al 2014 may provide a solution for treating the microplastic in the was however microplastics removal from the wastewater and was is still at the preliminary research stage future efforts could be devoted to design the specific microplastics targeted treatment unit and apply it in the full scale wwtps at current stage a longer sludge retention time srt or a larger anaerobic fermenter might be required for achieving the same performance as the was without microplastics accumulation if a relatively high amount of microplastics entering the sludge treatment system 4 conclusions in the laboratorial anaerobic fermentation system of this work the increased pet microplastics content i e 10 30 and 60 particles g ts in was repressed the hydrogen production from alkaline ph 10 anaerobic fermentation of was the depressing hydrogen production was due to that sludge hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis involved in hydrogen generation were significantly suppressed by pet microplastics although the homoacetogenesis and methanogenesis for hydrogen consumption were also inhibited under alkaline condition the microbial community analyses further confirmed that pet microplastics with 60 particles g ts decreased the abundances of hydrogen producers e g bacteroides sp tissierella sp and fonticella sp while the hydrogen consumers i e methanosaeta sp methanobacterium sp and acetoanaerobium sp were hardly observed mechanism studies indicated that the dbp leached and ros induced by pet microplastics were the major troublemakers to the decline of hydrogen yield through causing the loss of viability and activity of the relevant anaerobic

18596,alkaline especially ph 10 anaerobic fermentation of waste activated sludge was has been reported to be an effective approach for hydrogen production through inhibiting the homoacetogenesis and methanogenesis however the potential effect of the widespread microplastics in sludge on the performance of hydrogen production has never been reported to fill this knowledge gap the dominant polyethylene terephthalate pet microplastics in was were selected as the model microplastics to evaluate their influences on hydrogen production during alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was as well as the key mechanisms involved experimental results demonstrated that hydrogen production from was decreased in the presence of pet microplastics i e 10 30 and 60 particles g ts compared to the control with the hydrogen yield at 60 particles g ts being only 70 7 0 9 of the control although the hydrogen consumption i e homoacetogenesis and methanogenesis was restrained under alkaline ph 10 condition pet microplastics inhibited hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis in alkaline was anaerobic fermentation leading to the inhibitory effect on hydrogen production this was further confirmed by the microbial analysis which clearly showed pet microplastics caused the shift of the microbial community toward the direction against hydrolysis acidification mechanism studies revealed that pet microplastics carried on their negative influence mainly through leaching the toxic di n butyl phthalate dbp the reactive oxygen species ros and live dead staining tests indicated that the increased ros was induced by pet microplastics causing more cells dead which further resulted in the decreased production of hydrogen graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastics polyethylene terephthalate anaerobic fermentation hydrogen production waste activated sludge 1 introduction the emission of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels at a life threatening rate is causing global warming the rapid transition away from fossil fuels to a clean energy is currently in the great need hydrogen is widely viewed as an attractive renewable replacement because it creates enormous energy 286 kj mol with at least 2 75 times as much as hydrocarbons and produces water rather than carbon dioxide when burning cai et al 2004 recently biological production of hydrogen by anaerobic fermentation of organic wastes has attracted increasing attentions ueno et al 2007 valdez vazquez et al 2006 wang et al 2019 waste activated sludge was the major by product in biological wastewater treatment process is rich in organic substrates e g protein and carbohydrate wei et al 2018 which has been demonstrated to be a promising fermentation feedstock for hydrogen production cai et al 2004 turner 2004 zhao and chen 2011 with the conversion of was to hydrogen the fossil fuels are saved and the sludge is reduced thereby providing environmental and economic benefits simultaneously the hydrogen production from anaerobic fermentation of was generally goes through four stages hydrolysis acidification acetogenesis and hydrogen consumption wang et al 2018a usually the hydrogen yield is rather low 1 8 ml h2 g dried sludge due to the low hydrolysis efficiency and the rapid hydrogen consumption wang et al 2018c most previous studies in literature therefore focused on optimizing sludge pretreatment methods e g acidic alkaline sterilization ultrasonic and heat to enhance sludge hydrolysis and or inhibit hydrogen consumption oh et al 2003 wong et al 2014 xiao and liu 2009 among them recent studies confirmed that the hydrogen yield from was can be remarkably improved by anaerobic fermentation under constant alkaline i e ph 10 condition via the improvement of sludge hydrolysis and acidification and the inhibition of homoacetogenesis by acetobacteria zhao et al 2010 microplastics that are defined as synthetic polymers with the size 5 mm mahon et al 2017 have countless applications in consumer products such as cosmetic and personal care products medical supplies and industrial abrasives alimi et al 2018 browne et al 2011 wang et al 2018b the global utilization and skyrocketing production of microparticles inevitably results in a huge amount of these commercial microplastics entering the environment which is threatening the ecosystem schwarzenbach et al 2006 seidensticker et al 2017 wang et al 2018b laboratory based toxicological studies have identified the adverse impacts of microplastics on microorganisms bhattacharya et al 2010 wei et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 plankton cole et al 2015 lee et al 2013 blue mussel browne et al 2008 von moos et al 2012 bryozoans and arthropods gall and thompson 2015 microplastics have been documented to have capability of impacting key physiological functions such as energy metabolism respiration assimilation efficiency growth reproduction and survival cole et al 2016 gardon et al 2018 lu et al 2016 for example pinctada margaritifera showed the reduced assimilation efficiency energetic reserves and fecundity when exposed to commercial microbeads gardon et al 2018 the toxicity of microplastics might be associated with the chemical additives leached e silva et al 2016 li et al 2015 wei et al 2019 which were used to improve microplastic product properties lithner et al 2011 for example the chemical additives leaching from microplastics at the concentrations of 0 50 m2 l significantly increased the mortality of amphibalanus amphitrite li et al 2015 in addition the reactive oxygen species ros induced by microplastics was also found to be toxic to cells thereby causing the loss of cell viability bhattacharya et al 2010 jeong et al 2016 wastewater treatment plant wwtp has been identified as an important receptor of the discharged microplastics capturing the 95 99 of microplastics in the activated sludge via adsorption and aggregation carr et al 2016 murphy et al 2016 the partitioning of microplastics through the settling process results in that the majority of microplastics would be entrained in was li et al 2018 these microplastics in was might then pose significant effects on the biological treatment process of was through affecting the microorganisms involved as such the effective hydrogen production from alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was is very likely to be affected by the microplastics entrained in was however to the best of our knowledge so far the potential influence of the microplastics in sludge on the performance of hydrogen production from alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was has never been reported therefore the objective of this study was to investigate the impacts of microplastics on hydrogen production from anaerobic fermentation of was under alkaline condition i e using ph 10 as efficient strategy for enhancing hydrogen accumulation the most common microplastics in sludge are polyethylene terephthalate pet microplastics which are also a large class of microplastics detected in was due to their global ubiquity li et al 2018 sun et al 2019 thus pet microplastics were selected as the model microplastics to be evaluated in this work the impacts of pet microplastics on each step involved in hydrogen production and consumption were specifically investigated the diversities of microbial community in long term was anaerobic fermentation system exposed to pet microplastics were also examined in addition the mechanisms of pet microplastics affecting hydrogen production from alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was were explored through analyzing the toxic leachates and ros generation 2 materials and methods 2 1 was and pet microplastics the was used in this study was collected from the secondary sedimentation tank of a wwtp in shanghai china the collected sludge was concentrated by settling for 1 d and stored at 4 c before use the main characteristics of the was were listed in table 1 in the was various typical microplastics were identified and enumerated using the methods described in the analytical methods section five typical microplastics pet polyvinyl chloride pvc polyethylene pe polystyrene ps and polypropylene pp were detected among these microplastics pet microplastic was determined to be the dominant microplastics in was with the content of 2 1 1 1 particles g ts hence it was selected as the model microplastic to explore the influences on hydrogen production from was during alkaline anaerobic fermentation the morphology and size of all collected pet microplastics in the was were visually examined under a motic microscope ba410e motic electric group xiamen china with the axiocam 506 color digital camera then the average size was measured using oplenic software according the morphology characteristics of pet microplastics in the was the same pet microplastics sphere average size 25 2 μm density 1 4 g cm3 cas number 25038 59 9 were purchased and used in this study 2 2 influences of pet microplastics on hydrogen production from alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was the environmentally relevant concentration of pet microplastics was in the range of 1 60 particles g ts li et al 2018 therefore three levels 10 30 and 60 particles g ts of pet microplastics were used to investigate the impacts of pet microplastics on hydrogen production from was fermentation in this work the 1440 ml of raw was from one sampling were collected fully mixed and divided into four groups one group with the background pet microplastics level of 2 1 particles g ts was served as control note that besides pet microplastics the raw was might also contains other pollutants such as heavy metals persistent organic pollutants pops and other typical microplastics this control would account for the potential presence of various contaminants in raw was representing the hydrogen production from the raw was with various pollutants here we used pet microplastics at the concentrations of 10 30 and 60 particles g ts with equivalent mass dose of 0 09 0 32 and 0 66 mg g ts respectively supporting information table s1 thus the corresponding mass of pet microplastics were dosed using weighing paper in the other three was groups which resulted in the pet microplastics level of 10 30 and 60 particles g ts respectively the hydrogen potential tests were performed in four series of replicate serum bottles with the working volume of 400 m l each each bottle received 360 ml of the raw was or was with 10 30 and 60 pet particles g ts and 40 ml of the inocula that was withdrawn from a sludge anaerobic digester in our laboratory the ph value of sludge in each bottle was adjusted to 10 0 using hydrochloric acid hcl 4 mol l or sodium hydroxide naoh 4 mol l after flushing with nitrogen gas for around 2 min to ensure anaerobic condition each bottle was sealed by a rubber stopper with aluminum crimp cap and placed in an air bath shaker 120 rpm 37 1 c blank was also set up which contained 360 ml of tap water instead of the raw was and 40 ml of inocula during the whole fermentation process the ph value in each bottle was controlled at 10 0 by adding 4 mol l hcl or naoh with an automatic titrator for enhancing hydrogen accumulation from was zhao et al 2010 the methane generation could be completely inhibited at constant ph 10 0 yuan et al 2006 all tests were conducted in triplicate and lasted for around 21 d until the hydrogen production decreased to a negligible level the biogas i e h2 co2 and n2 production and composition were monitored periodically over the whole test periods the biogas production from was were obtained by subtracting biogas production from blank the hydrogen production from was were reported as the volume of hydrogen produced per gram of vs added ml h2 g vs added 2 3 influences of pet microplastics on hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis homoacetogenesis and methonogenesis processes sludge anaerobic fermentation generally undergoes several bio processes such as hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis homoacetogenesis and methonogenesis which collectively affect hydrogen production was hydrolysis is consider as the major rate limiting step in sludge anaerobic fermentation hydrogen is produced in the acidogenesis and acetogenesis steps while the generated hydrogen can be consumed in the homoacetogenesis and methonogenesis processes to evaluate the impacts of pet microplastics on each step involved in hydrogen production and consumption a series of batch tests were carried out using the model substrates in the literature mu and chen 2011 wang et al 2019 hydrolysis test the soluble protein and polysaccharide in the was is hydrolyzed at this first step to investigate the effects of pet microplastics on the hydrolysis of was the following batch tests with synthetic wastewater containing bovine serum albumin bsa model protein compound and dextran model polysaccharide compound were carried out all operations were the same as described in the influences of pet microplastics on hydrogen production from alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was section except that the was were replaced with synthetic wastewater containing bsa and dextran the synthetic wastewater was composed of mg l of tap water 1000 kh2po4 600 mgcl2 6h2o 400 cacl2 100 fecl3 1 0 nicl2 6h2o 0 5 znso4 7h2o 0 5 cocl2 6h2o 0 5 cuso4 5h2o and 0 5 mncl2 4h2o then 4 g l of bsa and 1 g l of dextran were added to the synthetic wastewater and dissolved the mass ratio of bsa and dextran was almost the same as that of protein and carbohydrate in was each test lasted for 4 d by determining the degradation of bsa and dextran the impacts of pet microplastics at the studied levels i e 10 30 and 60 particles g ts on hydrolysis process of was could be assessed acidogenesis test the amino acid and monosaccharide are the main products from was hydrolysis as such this test was conducted with the same operations described in the hydrolysis test section except that the model substrates i e bsa and dextran were replaced with 4 g l of glutamate model amino acid compound and 1 g l of glucose model monosaccharide compound acetogenesis test during acetogenesis process the butyric acid is converted to acetic acid the same operations were performed when the influences of pet microplastics on the acetogenesis process were evaluated except that the synthetic wastewater containing 4 g l of sodium butyrate homoacetogenesis and methonogenesis test during these two steps hydrogen and carbon dioxide are consumed to generate acetic acid and methane in this set of tests each serum bottle received 360 ml of the tap water with pet microplastics at the studied levels and 40 ml of the inocula during the entire test process the ph value in each bottle was controlled at ph 10 0 all bottles were sealed and placed in an air bath shaker 120 rpm 37 1 c when the hydrogen production did not increase with time the acetic acid concentration was measured and recorded then all bottles were flushed and filled with a combined gas 40 h2 10 co2 and 50 n2 all bottles were operated for anaerobic fermentation again for 2 d the volume of hydrogen and methane as well as the production of acetic acid were determined by analyzing and comparing the consumption of hydrogen and the productions of acetic acid and methane among these cases the effects of pet microplastics on homoacetogenesis and methonogenesis could be evaluated 2 4 influences of pet microplastics on microbial community in long term continuous operation of anaerobic fermentation reactor to further understand the long term effects of pet microplastics on alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was from the aspect of microbial community two lab scale anaerobic fermenters were operated continuously until reaching stable i e 80 d the two fermenters were replicate with a working volume of 1 l each both fermenters were continually mixed using magnetic stirrers 120 rmp the temperature in each fermenter was maintained at 37 1 c using a temperature controlled water jacket and ph was controlled at 10 0 by adding 4 mol l hcl or naoh with an automatic titrator after inoculation with 100 ml of inocula one fermenter as the control was fed with 900 ml raw was the other fermenter was fed with 900 ml was containing 60 particles pet microplastics g ts during the continuous operation 67 ml fermentation mixture was withdrawn every day and the same amount of the raw was or was with 60 particles pet microplastics g ts was fed resulting in a sludge retention time of 15 d the two anaerobic systems were operated continuously for 80 days more than 5 hrts until both fermenters reached stable stages then the sludge samples from the two fermenters were obtained to analyze the microbial communities using illumina miseq sequencing more details about the microbial community analysis were in supporting information si 2 5 determination of the chemicals leached from pet microplastics and the corresponding influences on hydrogen production according to the manufacturers the only plastic additive added during pet processing is di n butyl phthalate dbp which is accounting for 6 of pet microplastics to determine the corresponding concentrations of dbp leached from pet microplastics at the studied levels i e 10 30 and 60 particles g ts three levels of pet microplastics were respectively dosed in the three serum bottles with the mixture of the raw was 360 ml and the inocula 40 ml each all other operations were the same as the hydrogen potential tests above at different fermentation time i e 0 5 10 15 and 20 d the mixture samples were withdrawn and the concentrations of dbp leached were measured using the method detailed in the analytical methods section below the experiments of leachate i e dbp from pet microplastics affecting hydrogen production from was fermentation were then conducted with the same method described above except that the three studied levels of pet microplastics i e 10 30 and 60 particles g ts was replaced by the corresponding concentrations of dbp determined 2 6 determination of the ros generated from pet microplastics and the corresponding impacts on live dead microorganisms to explore the influences of pet microplastics on ros generation and the viability of microorganisms in the alkaline anaerobic fermenter the tests were performed with the same operations described in the influences of pet microplastics on hydrogen production from alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was section above after the fermentation for 21 d the mixture in each test was withdrawn then the ros level was measured and the live dead microorganisms were counted as detailed in the analytical methods section below 2 7 analytical methods the determination of ts vs and tcod were achieved according to standard methods dai et al 2017 protein and carbohydrate were measured using the bca bicinchoninic acid method and phenol sulfuric acid method respectively raunkjaer et al 1994 smith et al 1985 the detection procedure of various microplastics in raw was was divided into three steps sludge collection and pretreatment microplastic identification and quantification as detailed in si the ph value was monitored by the ph meter tps minichem the volume of biogas produced during the alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was was determined by a manometer based on the headspace gas pressure of the serum bottle the composition of biogas was analyzed using a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector gc tcd the hydrogen production was calculated based on the biogas volume and the hydrogen percentage the concentration of glutamate was determined according to the method described by darmaun et al 1985 the vfas e g acetic and butyric acids was measured using a gas chromatograph agilent fid with polar capillary column the detection limit was 1 mg l the carrier gas was nitrogen with the flow rate of 50 ml min the temperature of detector was 280 c the program of gc oven 50 c for 2 min then increase to 280 c 10 c min for 2 min the dbp leached from pet microplastics were extracted and analyzed by gc ms saturn 2000 varian using the method detailed in si more detailed information about ros measurement and live dead staining test also can be found in si independent samples t test was used to evaluate significant differences a value of p 0 05 was considered insignificant whereas a value of p 0 05 was considered significant in this work 3 results and discussion 3 1 influences of pet microplastics on hydrogen production from alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was the curves of the cumulative hydrogen yields from alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was with the different levels of pet microplastics were reported in fig 1 in the control the level of pet microplastics was the background concentration of 2 1 particles g ts in the raw was table 1 besides pet microplastics the control account for the potential presence of other contaminants e g heavy metals pops and other typical microplastics in raw was overall the hydrogen production from the raw was potentially with various pollutants gradually increased during the initial 19 d and then remained stable afterwards the maximal hydrogen production in the control was 24 7 0 9 ml g vs which was much higher than those reported in the literatures cai et al 2004 massanet nicolau et al 2008 ting and lee 2007 wang et al 2003 2018a 2018c xiao and liu 2009 demonstrating that alkaline ph 10 0 anaerobic fermentation is indeed an effective strategy for enhancing hydrogen production this result was consistent with previous result zhao et al 2010 however it was observed clearly that the presence of extra pet microplastics in the raw was at the studied levels i e 10 30 and 60 particles g ts significantly paired sample t test p 3 76e 05 8 42e 06 3 25e 06 inhibited the hydrogen productions from was throughout the 21 d test period increased pet microplastics levels resulted in decreased hydrogen production compared to the control the maximal hydrogen productions from was with pet microplastics of 10 30 and 60 particles g ts was 21 8 0 7 20 1 0 8 and 17 4 0 7 ml g vs representing the relative decreases of 11 6 0 1 18 4 0 1 and 29 3 0 1 respectively the reasons for the was with 10 30 and 60 particles g ts of pet microplastics producing significantly independent samples t test p 0 03 0 01 0 006 lower hydrogen than the raw was were addressed in the following text 3 2 influences of pet microplastics on each step involved in hydrogen production and consumption hydrogen production from was during alkaline anaerobic fermentation is generally related to several bio processes such as hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis homoacetogenesis and methonogenesis it is necessary to explore the effect of pet microplastics on each process for fully understand of the pet microplastic role in the whole anaerobic process these processes generally co occur in was fermentation systems thus the model substrates in the literature wang et al 2018c were used for evaluation the impacts of pet microplastics at the studied levels i e 10 30 and 60 particles g ts on the was hydrolysis was investigated with bsa and dextran as model protein and polysaccharide and the results were shown in fig 2 a the degradations of bsa and dextran in the control were 46 3 1 5 and 71 2 1 3 whereas pet microplastics at the studied levels i e 10 30 and 60 particles g ts restrained both bsa and dextran degradations with the highest decreases being approximately 20 3 0 1 from 46 3 1 5 to 36 9 1 2 and 13 2 0 1 from 71 2 1 3 to 61 8 1 1 respectively achieved at 60 pet particles g ts this result suggested that the presence of pet microplastics in was had the adverse effects on the hydrolysis of both protein and polysaccharide which reduced the availability of substrates for acidification thereby producing less hydrogen consequentially zhao et al 2010 fig 2b presented the influences of different concentrations of pet microplastics on the acidogenesis of main hydrolyzed products i e amino acid and monosaccharide to produce vfas and hydrogen the presence of pet microplastics reduced the degradation of glutamate and glucose the higher the pet microplastics levels the lower the degradations of glutamate and glucose as pet microplastics concentrations increasing from 10 to 60 particles g ts the degradations of glutamate during fermentation decreased from 92 7 0 1 to 82 2 0 2 of the control similarly the lowest glucose degradation 67 5 2 1 was obtained at 60 particles g ts of pet microplastics which was 11 6 2 1 lower than that in the control apart from acidogenesis hydrogen can be generated in the acetogenesis process accompanied the conversion of butyric acid to acetic acid similar results were also obtained as the effects of pet microplastics on the acetogenesis fig 2c the butyrate degradations decreased gradually from 19 6 0 7 to 17 4 0 4 with the increase of pet microplastics dosage from 0 to 20 particles g ts which decreased significantly p 0 03 to 16 2 0 9 when further increasing pet microplastics to 60 particles g ts all these results strongly revealed that pet microplastics would suppress hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis processes that related to hydrogen generation leading to the lower hydrogen production during was fermentation the produced hydrogen as metabolic intermediate can be further consumed to generate methane and acetic acid in homoacetogenesis and methonogenesis processes however after hydrogen filling there were very low hydrogen consumption only 1 0 in all cases and no significant p 0 05 changes in the production of acetic acid were observed for both control and experimental tests fig 2d in addition no methane was detected in each case these results suggested that both homoacetogenesis and methanogenesis were completely inhibited by alkaline ph 10 0 condition already in despite of the presence of pet microplastics which was in accordance with the previous study zhao et al 2010 3 3 influences of pet microplastics on microbial community in long term continuous operation of fermentation reactor to further understand the effect of pet microplastics on anaerobic microbes the two long term continuous anaerobic fermentation reactors fed with raw was as control or was containing 60 particles pet microplastics g ts as experimental were operated to assess the change of microbial community after exposure to pet microplastics rarefaction curves of both samples fig 3 a nearly reached saturation indicating that the sequencing depth had effectively captured the whole microbial species in the samples alpha diversity results in fig 3b showed that shannon 5 61 0 02 and chao 740 12 indices in the control were similar p 0 59 and 0 18 with those 5 64 0 03 729 6 in the experimental group revealing that the presence of pet microplastics did not significantly affect the microbial diversity taxonomic abundance scenarios in the two fermentation reactors fig 3c displayed the distributions of microbial populations at the phylum level firmicutes actinobacteria proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were the dominant microbial populations in both control and experimental reactors accounting for 68 5 76 7 of the total microbial community many microbes in these four phyla were known as hydrocarbon degraders for producing vfas and hydrogen which were generally abundant in various anaerobic habitats ariesyady et al 2007 wang et al 2018a zheng et al 2013 compared to those of the control the abundances of firmicutes actinobacteria and bacteroidetes in the experimental reactor significantly p 0 04 0 05 and 0 02 decreased by 12 2 0 1 20 5 0 1 and 29 6 0 2 respectively fig 3d this suggested that the presence of pet microplastics decreased the biodegradability of organic compounds further exploration at the genus level see fig 3e found that the presence of pet microplastics caused obvious decreases in the abundances of most anaerobes relevant to hydrogen production for example the bacteroides sp as a kind of hydrolytic bacteria wang et al 2018a was detected to occupy 2 1 0 1 and 1 6 0 1 abundances in the control and experimental reactors respectively representing a significant decrease p 0 019 of 23 8 0 1 similarly tissierella sp and fonticella sp which have been documented to generate vfas and hydrogen during anaerobic degradation of organic substrates wang et al 2017 2018a were also less abundant in the experimental reactor than the control p 0 014 and 0 039 expectedly the extremely low abundances of methanogens i e methanosaeta sp and methanobacterium sp and homoacetogenic bacteria i e acetoanaerobium sp were observed in both reactors confirming that alkaline ph 10 0 condition did almost completely inhibit homoacetogenesis and methanogenesis overall the presence of pet microplastics decreased the abundances of key hydrogen producers in alkaline was anaerobic fermentation significantly which was consistent with the lower hydrogen production observed in the testing with 60 particles pet microplastics g ts 3 4 mechanisms of pet microplastics affecting hydrogen production from alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was as demonstrated above the presence of pet microplastics at the studied levels i e 10 30 and 60 particles g ts reduced hydrogen yield from alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was via the inhibition of hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis as well as the shift of the microbial community toward the direction against hydrolysis acidification which led to a key question why such influences occurred the potential mechanisms of pet microplastics affecting hydrogen production were thus explored to answer this question first chemical additives could migrate from the microplastics due to their relatively low molecular weight resulting in the microplastics toxicity on microorganisms suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 reported that the additives keep leaching from microplastics during several months and the leaching rate did not significantly decrease with time however the microplastics were accumulated in was through urban wastewater treatment within a relatively short period e g within one month thus the additives leached from microplastics are likely to have an effect on was treatment system in this work the dbp was identified as the only prominent leachate from pet microplastics which was consistent with previous study suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 fig 4 a illustrated the corresponding concentrations of dbp leached from different levels of pet microplastics during alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was although a portion of dbp could be potentially absorbed to other particles in was during the leaching process the amounts of dbp leached in the sludge liquor increased gradually with time lapse increased pet microplastics concentrations led to more dbp leached to examine the impacts of dbp leached from pet microplastics on hydrogen production during alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was the hydrogen potential tests were operated with the corresponding concentrations of dbp leached instead of pet microplastics and the results were shown in si fig s1 aligning with the depressing performances of pet microplastics dbp leached also suppressed the hydrogen production and the cumulative hydrogen yields decreased with the increase of dbp amounts fig 4b compared the effects of different levels of pet microplastics i e 10 30 and 60 particles g ts and the corresponding dbp leached on the hydrogen production during alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was the hydrogen productions from was with pet microplastics of 10 30 and 60 particles g ts was 88 4 1 5 81 6 1 1 and 70 7 1 9 of the control whereas hydrogen productions in the presence of the corresponding dbp leached was 94 4 0 8 90 3 1 7 and 84 5 1 2 of the control respectively thus the toxic dbp leached from pet microplastics should be one contributor for pet microplastics restraining hydrogen production second the ros including the hydrogen peroxide h2o2 the superoxide o2 and the hydroxyl radical oh are known to cause toxic oxidative stress in cells or organisms mu and chen 2011 the production of ros could trigger redox sensitive signaling pathways e g the map kinases and nf kb cascades and disrupt inner membrane electron transfer leading to cytotoxicity and ultimately cellular apoptosis xia et al 2008 xiao et al 2003 microplastics exposure has been shown to up regulate ros production in organisms resulting in the loss of cell viability bhattacharya et al 2010 jeong et al 2016 especially previous studies reported that ros could be generated under anaerobic conditions degli esposti and mclennan 1998 mu and chen 2011 microplastics with the small size have a large surface area which determines a greater proportion of reactive groups to be displayed on the surface donaldson and tran 2002 in the anaerobic system the submicromolar concentrations of oxygen remained in the medium still could react with reduced groups on microplastics thereby producing nanomolar quantities of o2 and h2o2 through dismutation or fenton chemistry degli esposti and mclennan 1998 nel et al 2006 in addition the interaction of the formed h2o2 and reduced iron would produce the additional ros i e oh in this study an increase of the intracellular ros production was observed in the system with the increase of pet microplastics fig 4c with the maximum ros production increased by 23 3 1 9 compared to the control aligning with the ros measurement the results of live dead staining assay revealed that the fractions of the dead cells increased from 17 0 1 1 to 21 6 1 3 when pet microplastics increased from 10 to 30 particles g ts and then increased to 28 9 1 9 when further increasing pet microplastics level to 60 particles g ts whereas the dead cells fraction was only 10 9 0 7 in the control see fig 5 obviously the more pet microplastics presented in sludge the less live cells remained which was in accord with the observed hydrogen production from sludge anaerobic fermentation system exposed to different levels of pet microplastics therefore ros induced by pet microplastics should be another contributor to causing negative effects on hydrogen production during alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was based on the above results and discussion the mechanism for the pet microplastics inhibiting hydrogen production during alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was were concluded although the homoacetogenesis and methanogenesis for hydrogen consumption were suppressed when was was fermented at ph 10 the presence of pet microplastics at the studied levels i e 10 30 and 60 particles g ts negatively influenced hydrolysis acidification processes for hydrogen production the combined impacts of the dbp leached and ros induced by pet microplastics decreased the activity and viability of microorganisms and changed the microbial community in was fermentation reactors toward the direction against hydrolysis acidification leading to the reduced accumulation of hydrogen during alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was 3 5 implications for wastewater and was treatments this study confirmed that the presence of pet microplastics inhibited the hydrogen production during alkaline anaerobic fermentation of was therefore wastewater and was treatment systems need to be improved for reducing amount of microplastic released from was thereby avoiding microplastics entering sludge anaerobic system one optimal solution is to improve the light floating microplastics removal through grease removal stage and enhance the settling of the heavy microplastics during grit removal on primary clarifiers sun et al 2019 yang et al 2019 then the grease and grit need to be treated separately for preventing the removed microplastics entering the was in the aeration tank the remained microplastics in primary effluent can be easily absorbed into sludge flocs the flocculating agents e g ferric sulfate could be used to aid the accumulation of microplastics murphy et al 2016 besides membrane bioreactor mbr rapid sand filtration rsf discfilter df and dissolved air flotation daf also could be employed as microplastics targeted treatment units during the secondary treatment performance talvitie et al 2017 on the other hand a sludge pre treatment unit prior to anaerobic digester should be designed for the removal of the microplastics retained in the was the pyrolysis techniques such as thermal pyrolysis microwave assisted pyrolysis and catalytic pyrolysis undri et al 2014 may provide a solution for treating the microplastic in the was however microplastics removal from the wastewater and was is still at the preliminary research stage future efforts could be devoted to design the specific microplastics targeted treatment unit and apply it in the full scale wwtps at current stage a longer sludge retention time srt or a larger anaerobic fermenter might be required for achieving the same performance as the was without microplastics accumulation if a relatively high amount of microplastics entering the sludge treatment system 4 conclusions in the laboratorial anaerobic fermentation system of this work the increased pet microplastics content i e 10 30 and 60 particles g ts in was repressed the hydrogen production from alkaline ph 10 anaerobic fermentation of was the depressing hydrogen production was due to that sludge hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis involved in hydrogen generation were significantly suppressed by pet microplastics although the homoacetogenesis and methanogenesis for hydrogen consumption were also inhibited under alkaline condition the microbial community analyses further confirmed that pet microplastics with 60 particles g ts decreased the abundances of hydrogen producers e g bacteroides sp tissierella sp and fonticella sp while the hydrogen consumers i e methanosaeta sp methanobacterium sp and acetoanaerobium sp were hardly observed mechanism studies indicated that the dbp leached and ros induced by pet microplastics were the major troublemakers to the decline of hydrogen yield through causing the loss of viability and activity of the relevant anaerobic

18597,nitrate pollution in groundwater has become a widespread problem worldwide but understanding of the factors influencing groundwater nitrate pollution remains limited numerous studies have attributed nitrate pollution mostly to surface conditions and have neglected the role of hydrogeology therefore this study used the shaying river basin as the study area and developed a least squares surface fitting lssf model to systematically analyze the effect of hydrogeological conditions and surface pollution loads on groundwater nitrate pollution intrinsic vulnerability and total soil nitrogen tsn were used to represent hydrogeological conditions and surface pollution loads respectively the results showed that the concentrations of no3 n in shallow groundwater ranged from 0 002 to 256 29 mg l with an average of 14 38 mg l the concentration had an overall decreasing trend along the flow path the water chemistry tended to change from hco3 ca to hco3 cl ca as the no3 n concentration increased groundwater nitrate pollution was simultaneously controlled by intrinsic vulnerability and tsn and the lssf model explained 83 5 of the result within a 95 confidence interval these findings explained the phenomenon by which some areas had high surface loads but no serious groundwater nitrate pollution and some areas had nitrate pollution but no high surface loads nitrate accumulated in high levels in areas with a high intrinsic vulnerability due to hydrogeological conditions tsn which was the main source of no3 n in groundwater came mainly from agricultural nitrogen fertilizer inputs and livestock manure these findings provide helpful information for those tasked with managing and controlling groundwater quality graphical abstract image 1 keywords no3 n lssf model intrinsic vulnerability total soil nitrogen shaying river basin 1 introduction groundwater is one of the most important sources of drinking water in many cities and rural communities accounting for approximately 20 of the world s fresh water supply villholth and rajasooriyar 2010 chen et al 2017 in addition groundwater is widely used in municipal industrial and agricultural activities khosravi et al 2018 however population growth and agricultural industrial development threaten groundwater quality and quantity bosch et al 2015 gejl et al 2019 elevated concentrations of nitrate in groundwater have received widespread attention because they threaten human health ward and brender 2011 hutchins et al 2018 taufiq et al 2019 recent studies have shown that nitrate pollution in groundwater has a variable tendency from a point to a strip and from shallow to deep sutton et al 2011 kaushal et al 2011 han et al 2018 knowing the factors that affect groundwater pollution can help water resource managers prioritize measures to protect water supplies sajedi hosseini et al 2018 a contaminant source reflects the characteristics of surface loads and anthropogenic activities boy roura et al 2013 yang et al 2018 its impact on groundwater quality has been recognized such as in the long term response of shallow groundwater to nitrate from agriculture in denmark hansen et al 2019 the main sources of groundwater nitrate pollution are atmospheric deposition domestic sewage livestock and agricultural fertilization wakida and lerner 2005 zhang et al 2015 noorhosseini et al 2017 han et al 2018 the nitrogen is initially present in soil in the form of nh4 n han et al 2018 then with precipitation some nh4 n is carried away by surface runoff while some nh4 n leaches into the subsurface for the portion that infiltrates the ground in addition to that which is absorbed by crops or volatized in the form of nh3 nitrogen transformation is an important process li et al 2014 yan et al 2015 sufficient oxygen facilitates nitrification thereby resulting in the accumulation of nitrate landon et al 2011 however surface nitrogen loads and groundwater nitrate pollution levels are often inconsistent this has been speculated to be closely related to hydrogeological conditions jiang et al 2018 pronk et al 2009 noted that smaller surface loads can result in serious groundwater pollution in karst areas due to their highly vulnerable aquifer structure in this conduit system hydrogeological conditions facilitate the infiltration of surface loads into groundwater nanou and zagana 2018 in contrast maitre et al 2003 found that hydrogeological factors including hydraulic conductivity lithology and the water table can reduce the infiltration surface load into the subsurface thereby leading to less groundwater nitrate pollution in riparian areas the potential for nitrogen transformation in the subsurface environment of the manawatu river catchment new zealand was explored considering hydrogeological factors such as rock type topography soil type and rainfall rivas et al 2017 although the aforementioned studies demonstrate the effects of surface loads and hydrogeological conditions on groundwater nitrate pollution respectively they are limited in scope on one hand the types and quantities of hydrogeological parameters selected are not uniform and comprehensive in each study on the other hand there is a lack of methods to assess the comprehensive impact of hydrogeological conditions and surface loads on groundwater pollution simultaneously considering these concerns it is urgently necessary to take some measures to conduct a more comprehensive study intrinsic vulnerability reflects the difficulty of surface contaminants entering the aquifer from the perspective of hydrogeology vrba and zaporozec 1994 one of the most widely used methods for assessing this vulnerability is the drastic model which uses seven parameters to comprehensively quantify hydrogeological conditions fijani et al 2013 wang et al 2012 boy roura et al 2013 sadeghfam et al 2016 additionally the least squares surface fitting lssf model a multivariate nonlinear three dimensional regression model has been widely used to describe the relationships among multiple parameters in a computer aided geometric design area ma and kruth 1995 di et al 2009 the shaying river basin is a typical area with shallow groundwater nitrate pollution however little is known about the factors that contribute to the nitrate pollution in this area hence the objectives of this study were to 1 characterize the basic water quality and the spatial distribution of no3 n in the shallow groundwater of the shaying river basin 2 identify hydrogeological conditions by using parameters of the drastic model in an intrinsic vulnerability assessment and 3 evaluate the effects of inherent vulnerability and total soil nitrogen tsn on nitrate pollution based on the lssf model the novelty of this research is that it quantifies the role of hydrogeological conditions and simultaneously assesses the comprehensive impact of hydrogeological conditions and surface loads on groundwater nitrate pollution by using a bivariate lssf model which can provide more helpful information for managing and controlling groundwater quality 2 study area the shaying river basin the largest sub basin in the huai river basin china fig 1 covers an area of approximately 39 880 km2 and has a population of more than 26 4 million people the terrain slopes from northwest to southeast the altitude of the northwestern region is higher than 500 m above mean sea level amsl and the altitude of the southeastern region varies from 30 to 100 m amsl yan et al 2015 the study area has a continental monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 14 15 c the mean annual precipitation is approximately 1401 7 mm in the northwest and 600 900 mm in the southeast precipitation occurs mostly from june to september this accounts for 60 65 of the annual precipitation the potential evapotranspiration is approximately 1149 mm year yang 2012 the main soil types in the shaying river basin are cinnamon soil and shajiang black soil bai et al 2016 the main vadose zone media are typically silt or silty clay fig s1 the groundwater is divided vertically into shallow groundwater 50 m and deep groundwater 50 m based on the report of comprehensive environmental geological research in huaihe basin ye and liu 2009 shallow groundwater is held mainly in sand and gravel aquifers of the quaternary and neogene which are recharged vertically from atmospheric precipitation surface water and irrigation backwater the main discharge pathways include vertical evaporation artificial exploitation and lateral runoff the shallow groundwater is closely related to the external environment changes in environmental conditions can directly affect the shallow groundwater the deep groundwater is a semiclosed system with the hydraulic properties of confined water hence lateral runoff and overflow are the only sources of recharge and artificial mining is the main discharge pathway 3 materials and methods 3 1 research idea and flowchart fig 2 provides an overview of the research idea and a flowchart used to explore the effects of hydrogeological conditions and surface loads on shallow groundwater nitrate pollution in the shaying river basin 3 2 groundwater sampling and analysis six hundred groundwater samples were collected from shallow aquifers in the shaying river basin the field work was mainly conducted from june to august summer in 2010 2016 the climate and hydrological conditions were very similar at this time water samples were collected by pump and stored in an incubator at 4 c before being transported back to the laboratory all operating procedures followed the regulation for water environmental monitoring sl219 98 during the sampling water

of these data required charge conservation and acid base balance testing before usage the test standards are detailed in the supplementary information si 3 3 acquisition of surface loads data the leaching of surface loads under precipitation is a potential source of nitrate pollution in groundwater agricultural nitrogen fertilizer nf and cultured manure are the main types of surface nitrogen loads all these surface nitrogen loads first enter the soil therefore the nitrogen content distribution and morphology of the soil reflect the nitrogen supply capacity of the soil the total soil nitrogen tsn soil organic carbon soc nf and cultivation data for the shaying river basin were collected from the china soil database and the literature si tables s1 s2 and s3 3 4 drastic model for intrinsic vulnerability assessment the drastic model is a standard method popularly used in many countries assessing aquifer intrinsic vulnerability using the drastic model can comprehensively reflect hydrogeological conditions the seven parameters in this model include depth to water d net recharge r aquifer water yield a soil media s topography t impact of vadose zone i and hydraulic conductivity c aller et al 1985 the details of the seven parameters which were revised in yan et al 2015 and chen 2013 are described fully in the si table s4 first the parameters r are rated from 1 to 10 and then assigned a normalized weight w from 0 to 1 the principle of the weight setting is based on the ability of each parameter to resist pollution which was calculated objectively using the principal component method of factor analysis pcfa details in si as eq 1 1 w j 1 a i 1 n h i h j where w i is the weight for parameter i a is the cumulative variance contribution rate for all of the parameters h i represents the load value for parameter i and h j is the factor contribution rate for factor j the weight of each parameter is multiplied by its rate and then summed to obtain the drastic index by eq 2 2 drastic index d i d r d w r r r w a r a w s r s w t r t w i r i w c r c w 3 d i n o r d i i d i m i n d i m a x d i m i n 100 where the subscripts r and w represent the rating and the weight respectively si tables s4 and s5 di nor di i di min and di max are the normalized actual minimum and maximum drastic index respectively the parameters superposition and di classification natural breaks jenks were conducted using arcgis 9 3 software 3 5 least squares surface fitting lssf model the lssf model is a commonly used mathematical algorithm that is based on progressive and iterative approximation deng and lin 2014 it can be used not only to solve a large system of linear equations but also to generate a series of approximation curves or surfaces lin and zhang 2011 the lssf model begins with an initial blending surface and then constructs a series of fitting surfaces by adjusting the control points iteratively in each iteration the adjusting vector of each control point is a weighted sum of some difference vectors between the data points and their corresponding points on the fitting surface the lssf model derives the surface fitting as shown below 4 f x i y j i 0 n j 1 m β i j 1 x i y j 1 where f x i y i is the response variable at location i j β i j 1 are the slope coefficients of the explanatory variables x i y j 1 and n and m are the number of variables the response variable is the nitrate concentration in groundwater the model fit was checked to select a better performance and had a consistent conceptual hydrogeological meaning the model errors were based on the coefficient of determination r2 mean squared error values mse and root mean square standardized error rmsse rahman et al 2018 5 m s e 1 n i 1 n p s i o s i 6 r m s s e 1 n i 1 n p s i o s

characteristics of groundwater chemistry and quality the hydrochemical characteristics of the shallow groundwater in the shaying river basin are shown in fig 3 the dominant type of anion is hco3 followed by hco3 cl which accounted for 68 6 and 18 5 of the samples respectively in contrast the dominant cation type is mainly ca and ca mg followed by ca na which account for 37 3 28 1 and 6 5 of the samples respectively in the midwestern region of the shaying river basin the hydrochemistry of the groundwater is mainly hco3 ca and hco3 cl ca additionally small amounts of cl hco3 ca and cl hco3 ca mg groundwater are distributed to the northwest and southeast of the city of xuchang it is notable that a small amount of no3 type groundwater is distributed in the shaying river basin fig s2 the groundwater hydrochemistry tends to develop from hco3 ca rich to hco3 cl ca rich as the no3 n concentration increased meanwhile as a result of a comparison of the basic parameters it is clear that the cl concentration at the over standard no3 n points is higher than that at the non over standard no3 n points fig s3 this result indicates that its hydrochemical characteristics have already been affected by human activities in this region peng et al 2018 in the shaying river basin groundwater ph ranges from 6 20 to 8 30 with an average of 7 38 the groundwater temperature is 17 24 1 14 c the average orp value is 93 23 mv which means that the shallow groundwater is mainly anoxidized environment the average do value of 2 63 mg l also confirms this feature the range of tds in the shaying river basin is mainly 500 1000 mg l which accounts for 52 of the samples followed by 300 500 mg l and 1000 2000 mg l the area with tds less than 500 mg l is mainly concentrated in the city of fuyang and the range between 1000 and 2000 mg l is distributed in the southeast of the cities of xuchang and zhoukou the no3 n concentration in the shaying river basin ranges between 0 002 mg l and 256 29 mg l with an average concentration of 14 38 mg l which exceeds the acceptable limits for drinking water recommended 10 mg l by who who 2011 in contrast no2 n average of 0 012 mg l and nh4 n average of 0 097 mg l concentrations are much lower than the no3 n concentration hence no3 n is the dominant inorganic n species in the shaying river basin the chemical oxygen demand cod in shallow groundwater is 1 67 2 25 mg l 4 2 spatial distribution of groundwater no3 n the spatial distribution of no3 n concentrations in the shaying river basin is shown in fig 4 the concentration of no3 n in the shallow groundwater increased from 1 53 mg l in the 1960s 1980s to 14 38 mg l wang et al 2007 among the 600 groups of groundwater samples 376 groups had no3 n concentrations less than 10 mg l 78 groups 45 groups had a range of 10 20 mg l 20 30 mg l and 101 groups had concentrations greater than 30 mg l no3 n concentrations exceeding 10 mg l accounted for 37 3 of the total samples areas with higher no3 n concentrations 30 mg l are mainly distributed in the sloping area of the piedmont alluvial fan in the northwestern part of the shaying river basin which includes recharge and subsurface passage areas along the groundwater flow direction the number of over standard no3 n points decreased gradually downstream of the shaying river basin the no3 n concentration was less than 10 mg l in more than 70 of samples from the perspective of urban distributions points where no3 n are over standard are distributed mainly around the cities of pingdingshan xuchang zhoukou luohe and fuyang peng et al 2018 noted that no3 n is an important indicator for the impact of human activity on groundwater quality the large populations and concentrated human activity around the cities may be the main reason for the no3 n pollution 4 3 tsn and soc mapping tsn concentrations in the shaying river basin ranged from 0 45 to 1 82 g kg with an average of 1 01 g kg after obtaining the tsn concentrations of the samples the inverse distance weighted idw interpolation method was applied to map the distribution of tsn within 2 17 km grid cells in arcgis 9 3 fig 5 a the highest tsn was recorded in the northwestern part of the shaying river basin along the flow direction tsn concentration generally decreased the lowest values were recorded in the southeastern part of the basin to understand the source of soil nitrogen in this study area better unary and multiple linear regression models were used to explore the relationships among tsn soc nf and cultivation the results showed that the predicted tsn and the observed tsn were significantly and positively correlated fig 5b the value of the dependent variable as a function of the independent variables was best described by tsn 0 025 soc 0 216 r2 0 67 through the unary linear regression model and tsn 0 001 nf 0 064 cultivation 0 707 r2 0 45 through the multiple linear regression model this result demonstrated that there were significant positive relationships among tsn and soc nf and cultivation hence nf and frequent cultivation are the main sources of tsn and contribute to groundwater nitrate groundwater nitrate pollution associated with nf loading and cultivation has also been observed in other studies and areas nolan et al 2002 greene et al 2005 4 4 intrinsic vulnerability of the aquifer the rating and intrinsic vulnerability distributions of the parameters in the drastic model are presented in fig 6 the values vary from 0 to 10 with higher values indicating greater vulnerability of aquifer the parameters of depth to water and net recharge indicated a higher vulnerability with values of 6 10 in the plain area than in the piedmont alluvial fan in contrast the parameters of aquifer water yield property soil media topography and impact of vadose zone showed the opposite tendency areas with higher values and vulnerability were mainly distributed in the recharge area of the piedmont alluvial fan along the groundwater flow direction the aquifer vulnerability decreased gradually with decrease of the value of these parameters from 10 to 1 the value of the hydraulic conductivity parameter indicated that aquifer vulnerability was mainly distributed in the middle and northwestern regions of the shaying river basin although each of these parameters has a specific impact on the vulnerability of the aquifer the real intrinsic vulnerability is the result of the interaction of these parameters the intrinsic vulnerability map of the aquifer was produced by a superposition calculation of each parameter in the drastic model fig 7 a the drastic index di was calculated using eq 2 and normalized to an integer between 0 and 100 using eq 3 aquifer vulnerability was classified into five classes i v very low di 22 3 low di 22 4 35 9 moderate di 36 0 48 3 high di 48 4 63 0 and very high di 63 1 fig 7b the very low intrinsic and low vulnerability areas are distributed mainly in the southeastern part of the shaying river basin and account for approximately 56 8 of the entire study area these areas are mainly related to loam soil media clay vadose zone and the lowest hydraulic conductivity the moderate intrinsic vulnerability area 20 8 of the study area was distributed in the middle of the shaying river basin in this area the parameters depth to water net recharge soil media and impact of vadose zone show almost no significant difference from those in the low vulnerability area however the hydraulic conductivity is almost twice as large as in the low vulnerability area which resulted in the much higher intrinsic vulnerability high and very high intrinsic vulnerability areas 22 4 of the entire study area were distributed mainly in the northwestern part of the shaying river basin loamy sand or sandy loam soil media and coarse sand or gravel vadose zone type have a higher permeability this increases the intrinsic vulnerability of the aquifer 4 5 analysis of influence factors on nitrate pollution to further understand the effects of hydrogeological conditions and surface loads on shallow groundwater nitrate pollution in the shaying river basin the influences of tsn and intrinsic vulnerability on the shallow groundwater nitrate concentration were analyzed significant differences between no3 n and tsn p 0 05 and no3 n and intrinsic vulnerability p 0 05 were found in the shaying river basin meaning that no3 n concentrations were quite variable and affected by a set of factors the lssf model analysis revealed relationships among tsn intrinsic vulnerability and no3 n concentration as shown on the three dimensional coordinate system in fig 8 the results show that no3 n points infinitely approach and fall into a surface dominated by intrinsic vulnerability and tsn with r 2 of 0 89 mse of 0 11 and rmsse of 0 03 fig 8a model residuals are normally distributed fig 8b according to the r2 mse rmsse and model residuals there is a satisfactory goodness of fit for large parts of the groundwater data boy roura et al 2013 the graph from the top down perspective fig 8c shows that there are no3 n points higher than the upper 95 confidence interval whereas the main view fig 8d and left view fig 8e clearly show no3 n points both inside of and outside of the 95 confidence interval even though some of the no3 n points did not fall onto the surface the no3 n points on the surface explain 83 5 of the variance within the 95 confidence interval this result reveals that the groundwater no3 n pollution is simultaneously controlled by surface nitrogen loads and hydrogeological conditions theoretically areas with higher intrinsic vulnerability and surface nitrogen loads can lead to serious nitrate pollution of groundwater greene et al 2005 nolan and hitt 2006 a comparison of figs 4 5 and 7 shows that many of the no3 n pollution points in the shaying river basin are distributed in areas with high or moderate surface nitrogen loads and high or moderate intrinsic vulnerability this result is caused by the cumulative effect of vulnerable hydrogeological conditions on surface nitrogen loads in addition a small portion of the no3 n pollution points are distributed in low vulnerability areas with moderate surface nitrogen loads although andrade and stigter 2009 concluded that dilution by surface water played a role in the attenuation of pollutant infiltration into groundwater and debernardi et al 2008 felt that low intrinsic vulnerability was important no3 n pollution is simultaneously controlled by intrinsic vulnerability and surface nitrogen loads hence groundwater nitrate pollution can also occur in areas of low vulnerability due to the long term retention of high or moderate surface loads 4 6 validation of the results although the groundwater nitrate pollution has been proven to be controlled by hydrogeological conditions and surface loads simultaneously as validated by r2 mse rmsse and their residuals further validation is required due to the limitations of these parameters kura et al 2015 arauzo 2017 therefore 10 shallow groundwater samples along section a a fig 1 from ye county were used to validate the result further the validation results in fig 9 show that the groundwater no3 n pollution was distributed at the points with moderate or high intrinsic vulnerability and moderate total soil nitrogen due to the cumulative effect in addition high total soil nitrogen can lead to an increase of no3 n at points of low intrinsic vulnerability due to long term retention these results once again confirm that the groundwater no3 n pollution is simultaneously controlled by surface nitrogen loads and hydrogeological conditions 5 conclusion the least squares surface fitting model predicted a surface that could well fit groundwater nitrate pollution through surface loads and intrinsic vulnerability it proved that the groundwater nitrate pollution in the shaying river basin is simultaneously controlled by surface loads and hydrogeological conditions with an 83 5 interpretation rate it is easy to understand and widely accepted that surface loads affect groundwater pollution the tsn came mainly from inputs of agricultural nitrogen fertilizer and livestock manure and it is the main source of nitrate in the groundwater a novel finding is that the hydrogeological conditions represented by intrinsic vulnerability also play an important role in affecting groundwater nitrate pollution and that its influence tendency is nonlinear this finding explained the phenomenon of some areas having high surface loads but no serious groundwater nitrate pollution and some areas having nitrate pollution but no high surface loads based on this work it was verified that serious groundwater nitrate pollution not only existed in high vulnerability areas with moderate or low surface loads but also existed in low vulnerability areas with high surface loads in analyses of the genesis of groundwater pollution the comprehensive influence of surface loads and hydrogeological conditions must be considered simultaneously it is insufficient to consider only one sided factors this finding provides helpful information for managing and controlling groundwater quality by reducing surface nitrogen sources and minimizing human activities in high

18597,nitrate pollution in groundwater has become a widespread problem worldwide but understanding of the factors influencing groundwater nitrate pollution remains limited numerous studies have attributed nitrate pollution mostly to surface conditions and have neglected the role of hydrogeology therefore this study used the shaying river basin as the study area and developed a least squares surface fitting lssf model to systematically analyze the effect of hydrogeological conditions and surface pollution loads on groundwater nitrate pollution intrinsic vulnerability and total soil nitrogen tsn were used to represent hydrogeological conditions and surface pollution loads respectively the results showed that the concentrations of no3 n in shallow groundwater ranged from 0 002 to 256 29 mg l with an average of 14 38 mg l the concentration had an overall decreasing trend along the flow path the water chemistry tended to change from hco3 ca to hco3 cl ca as the no3 n concentration increased groundwater nitrate pollution was simultaneously controlled by intrinsic vulnerability and tsn and the lssf model explained 83 5 of the result within a 95 confidence interval these findings explained the phenomenon by which some areas had high surface loads but no serious groundwater nitrate pollution and some areas had nitrate pollution but no high surface loads nitrate accumulated in high levels in areas with a high intrinsic vulnerability due to hydrogeological conditions tsn which was the main source of no3 n in groundwater came mainly from agricultural nitrogen fertilizer inputs and livestock manure these findings provide helpful information for those tasked with managing and controlling groundwater quality graphical abstract image 1 keywords no3 n lssf model intrinsic vulnerability total soil nitrogen shaying river basin 1 introduction groundwater is one of the most important sources of drinking water in many cities and rural communities accounting for approximately 20 of the world s fresh water supply villholth and rajasooriyar 2010 chen et al 2017 in addition groundwater is widely used in municipal industrial and agricultural activities khosravi et al 2018 however population growth and agricultural industrial development threaten groundwater quality and quantity bosch et al 2015 gejl et al 2019 elevated concentrations of nitrate in groundwater have received widespread attention because they threaten human health ward and brender 2011 hutchins et al 2018 taufiq et al 2019 recent studies have shown that nitrate pollution in groundwater has a variable tendency from a point to a strip and from shallow to deep sutton et al 2011 kaushal et al 2011 han et al 2018 knowing the factors that affect groundwater pollution can help water resource managers prioritize measures to protect water supplies sajedi hosseini et al 2018 a contaminant source reflects the characteristics of surface loads and anthropogenic activities boy roura et al 2013 yang et al 2018 its impact on groundwater quality has been recognized such as in the long term response of shallow groundwater to nitrate from agriculture in denmark hansen et al 2019 the main sources of groundwater nitrate pollution are atmospheric deposition domestic sewage livestock and agricultural fertilization wakida and lerner 2005 zhang et al 2015 noorhosseini et al 2017 han et al 2018 the nitrogen is initially present in soil in the form of nh4 n han et al 2018 then with precipitation some nh4 n is carried away by surface runoff while some nh4 n leaches into the subsurface for the portion that infiltrates the ground in addition to that which is absorbed by crops or volatized in the form of nh3 nitrogen transformation is an important process li et al 2014 yan et al 2015 sufficient oxygen facilitates nitrification thereby resulting in the accumulation of nitrate landon et al 2011 however surface nitrogen loads and groundwater nitrate pollution levels are often inconsistent this has been speculated to be closely related to hydrogeological conditions jiang et al 2018 pronk et al 2009 noted that smaller surface loads can result in serious groundwater pollution in karst areas due to their highly vulnerable aquifer structure in this conduit system hydrogeological conditions facilitate the infiltration of surface loads into groundwater nanou and zagana 2018 in contrast maitre et al 2003 found that hydrogeological factors including hydraulic conductivity lithology and the water table can reduce the infiltration surface load into the subsurface thereby leading to less groundwater nitrate pollution in riparian areas the potential for nitrogen transformation in the subsurface environment of the manawatu river catchment new zealand was explored considering hydrogeological factors such as rock type topography soil type and rainfall rivas et al 2017 although the aforementioned studies demonstrate the effects of surface loads and hydrogeological conditions on groundwater nitrate pollution respectively they are limited in scope on one hand the types and quantities of hydrogeological parameters selected are not uniform and comprehensive in each study on the other hand there is a lack of methods to assess the comprehensive impact of hydrogeological conditions and surface loads on groundwater pollution simultaneously considering these concerns it is urgently necessary to take some measures to conduct a more comprehensive study intrinsic vulnerability reflects the difficulty of surface contaminants entering the aquifer from the perspective of hydrogeology vrba and zaporozec 1994 one of the most widely used methods for assessing this vulnerability is the drastic model which uses seven parameters to comprehensively quantify hydrogeological conditions fijani et al 2013 wang et al 2012 boy roura et al 2013 sadeghfam et al 2016 additionally the least squares surface fitting lssf model a multivariate nonlinear three dimensional regression model has been widely used to describe the relationships among multiple parameters in a computer aided geometric design area ma and kruth 1995 di et al 2009 the shaying river basin is a typical area with shallow groundwater nitrate pollution however little is known about the factors that contribute to the nitrate pollution in this area hence the objectives of this study were to 1 characterize the basic water quality and the spatial distribution of no3 n in the shallow groundwater of the shaying river basin 2 identify hydrogeological conditions by using parameters of the drastic model in an intrinsic vulnerability assessment and 3 evaluate the effects of inherent vulnerability and total soil nitrogen tsn on nitrate pollution based on the lssf model the novelty of this research is that it quantifies the role of hydrogeological conditions and simultaneously assesses the comprehensive impact of hydrogeological conditions and surface loads on groundwater nitrate pollution by using a bivariate lssf model which can provide more helpful information for managing and controlling groundwater quality 2 study area the shaying river basin the largest sub basin in the huai river basin china fig 1 covers an area of approximately 39 880 km2 and has a population of more than 26 4 million people the terrain slopes from northwest to southeast the altitude of the northwestern region is higher than 500 m above mean sea level amsl and the altitude of the southeastern region varies from 30 to 100 m amsl yan et al 2015 the study area has a continental monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 14 15 c the mean annual precipitation is approximately 1401 7 mm in the northwest and 600 900 mm in the southeast precipitation occurs mostly from june to september this accounts for 60 65 of the annual precipitation the potential evapotranspiration is approximately 1149 mm year yang 2012 the main soil types in the shaying river basin are cinnamon soil and shajiang black soil bai et al 2016 the main vadose zone media are typically silt or silty clay fig s1 the groundwater is divided vertically into shallow groundwater 50 m and deep groundwater 50 m based on the report of comprehensive environmental geological research in huaihe basin ye and liu 2009 shallow groundwater is held mainly in sand and gravel aquifers of the quaternary and neogene which are recharged vertically from atmospheric precipitation surface water and irrigation backwater the main discharge pathways include vertical evaporation artificial exploitation and lateral runoff the shallow groundwater is closely related to the external environment changes in environmental conditions can directly affect the shallow groundwater the deep groundwater is a semiclosed system with the hydraulic properties of confined water hence lateral runoff and overflow are the only sources of recharge and artificial mining is the main discharge pathway 3 materials and methods 3 1 research idea and flowchart fig 2 provides an overview of the research idea and a flowchart used to explore the effects of hydrogeological conditions and surface loads on shallow groundwater nitrate pollution in the shaying river basin 3 2 groundwater sampling and analysis six hundred groundwater samples were collected from shallow aquifers in the shaying river basin the field work was mainly conducted from june to august summer in 2010 2016 the climate and hydrological conditions were very similar at this time water samples were collected by pump and stored in an incubator at 4 c before being transported back to the laboratory all operating procedures followed the regulation for water environmental monitoring sl219 98 during the sampling water temperature t oxidation reduction potential orp ph and dissolved oxygen do were measured in situ using a multi parameter water quality monitor eureka usa with an analytical precision of 0 10 c in temperature 20 mv in orp 0 02 units in ph and 0 20 mg l in do the testing of ion and nutrient indicators was carried out on samples at the groundwater mineral water and environmental monitoring center of the institute of hydrogeology and environmental geology chinese academy of geological sciences the total dissolved solids tds were measured by the gravimetric method cations k na ca2 and mg2 were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent 7500ce icp ms tokyo japan hco3 and co3 2 were measured by acid base titration nutrient indicators nh4 no3 and no2 measured in n and other anions so4 2 and cl were determined using ion chromatography ic shimadzu lc 10advp japan huang et al 2018 the relative errors were less than 5 for all analyzed parameters additionally all of these data required charge conservation and acid base balance testing before usage the test standards are detailed in the supplementary information si 3 3 acquisition of surface loads data the leaching of surface loads under precipitation is a potential source of nitrate pollution in groundwater agricultural nitrogen fertilizer nf and cultured manure are the main types of surface nitrogen loads all these surface nitrogen loads first enter the soil therefore the nitrogen content distribution and morphology of the soil reflect the nitrogen supply capacity of the soil the total soil nitrogen tsn soil organic carbon soc nf and cultivation data for the shaying river basin were collected from the china soil database and the literature si tables s1 s2 and s3 3 4 drastic model for intrinsic vulnerability assessment the drastic model is a standard method popularly used in many countries assessing aquifer intrinsic vulnerability using the drastic model can comprehensively reflect hydrogeological conditions the seven parameters in this model include depth to water d net recharge r aquifer water yield a soil media s topography t impact of vadose zone i and hydraulic conductivity c aller et al 1985 the details of the seven parameters which were revised in yan et al 2015 and chen 2013 are described fully in the si table s4 first the parameters r are rated from 1 to 10 and then assigned a normalized weight w from 0 to 1 the principle of the weight setting is based on the ability of each parameter to resist pollution which was calculated objectively using the principal component method of factor analysis pcfa details in si as eq 1 1 w j 1 a i 1 n h i h j where w i is the weight for parameter i a is the cumulative variance contribution rate for all of the parameters h i represents the load value for parameter i and h j is the factor contribution rate for factor j the weight of each parameter is multiplied by its rate and then summed to obtain the drastic index by eq 2 2 drastic index d i d r d w r r r w a r a w s r s w t r t w i r i w c r c w 3 d i n o r d i i d i m i n d i m a x d i m i n 100 where the subscripts r and w represent the rating and the weight respectively si tables s4 and s5 di nor di i di min and di max are the normalized actual minimum and maximum drastic index respectively the parameters superposition and di classification natural breaks jenks were conducted using arcgis 9 3 software 3 5 least squares surface fitting lssf model the lssf model is a commonly used mathematical algorithm that is based on progressive and iterative approximation deng and lin 2014 it can be used not only to solve a large system of linear equations but also to generate a series of approximation curves or surfaces lin and zhang 2011 the lssf model begins with an initial blending surface and then constructs a series of fitting surfaces by adjusting the control points iteratively in each iteration the adjusting vector of each control point is a weighted sum of some difference vectors between the data points and their corresponding points on the fitting surface the lssf model derives the surface fitting as shown below 4 f x i y j i 0 n j 1 m β i j 1 x i y j 1 where f x i y i is the response variable at location i j β i j 1 are the slope coefficients of the explanatory variables x i y j 1 and n and m are the number of variables the response variable is the nitrate concentration in groundwater the model fit was checked to select a better performance and had a consistent conceptual hydrogeological meaning the model errors were based on the coefficient of determination r2 mean squared error values mse and root mean square standardized error rmsse rahman et al 2018 5 m s e 1 n i 1 n p s i o s i 6 r m s s e 1 n i 1 n p s i o s i 2 where ps i and os i are the standardized observation and prediction values respectively and n is the total number of samples in the training or testing dataset 4 results and discussion 4 1 general characteristics of groundwater chemistry and quality the hydrochemical characteristics of the shallow groundwater in the shaying river basin are shown in fig 3 the dominant type of anion is hco3 followed by hco3 cl which accounted for 68 6 and 18 5 of the samples respectively in contrast the dominant cation type is mainly ca and ca mg followed by ca na which account for 37 3 28 1 and 6 5 of the samples respectively in the midwestern region of the shaying river basin the hydrochemistry of the groundwater is mainly hco3 ca and hco3 cl ca additionally small amounts of cl hco3 ca and cl hco3 ca mg groundwater are distributed to the northwest and southeast of the city of xuchang it is notable that a small amount of no3 type groundwater is distributed in the shaying river basin fig s2 the groundwater hydrochemistry tends to develop from hco3 ca rich to hco3 cl ca rich as the no3 n concentration increased meanwhile as a result of a comparison of the basic parameters it is clear that the cl concentration at the over standard no3 n points is higher than that at the non over standard no3 n points fig s3 this result indicates that its hydrochemical characteristics have already been affected by human activities in this region peng et al 2018 in the shaying river basin groundwater ph ranges from 6 20 to 8 30 with an average of 7 38 the groundwater temperature is 17 24 1 14 c the average orp value is 93 23 mv which means that the shallow groundwater is mainly anoxidized environment the average do value of 2 63 mg l also confirms this feature the range of tds in the shaying river basin is mainly 500 1000 mg l which accounts for 52 of the samples followed by 300 500 mg l and 1000 2000 mg l the area with tds less than 500 mg l is mainly concentrated in the city of fuyang and the range between 1000 and 2000 mg l is distributed in the southeast of the cities of xuchang and zhoukou the no3 n concentration in the shaying river basin ranges between 0 002 mg l and 256 29 mg l with an average concentration of 14 38 mg l which exceeds the acceptable limits for drinking water recommended 10 mg l by who who 2011 in contrast no2 n average of 0 012 mg l and nh4 n average of 0 097 mg l concentrations are much lower than the no3 n concentration hence no3 n is the dominant inorganic n species in the shaying river basin the chemical oxygen demand cod in shallow groundwater is 1 67 2 25 mg l 4 2 spatial distribution of groundwater no3 n the spatial distribution of no3 n concentrations in the shaying river basin is shown in fig 4 the concentration of no3 n in the shallow groundwater increased from 1 53 mg l in the 1960s 1980s to 14 38 mg l wang et al 2007 among the 600 groups of groundwater samples 376 groups had no3 n concentrations less than 10 mg l 78 groups 45 groups had a range of 10 20 mg l 20 30 mg l and 101 groups had concentrations greater than 30 mg l no3 n concentrations exceeding 10 mg l accounted for 37 3 of the total samples areas with higher no3 n concentrations 30 mg l are mainly distributed in the sloping area of the piedmont alluvial fan in the northwestern part of the shaying river basin which includes recharge and subsurface passage areas along the groundwater flow direction the number of over standard no3 n points decreased gradually downstream of the shaying river basin the no3 n concentration was less than 10 mg l in more than 70 of samples from the perspective of urban distributions points where no3 n are over standard are distributed mainly around the cities of pingdingshan xuchang zhoukou luohe and fuyang peng et al 2018 noted that no3 n is an important indicator for the impact of human activity on groundwater quality the large populations and concentrated human activity around the cities may be the main reason for the no3 n pollution 4 3 tsn and soc mapping tsn concentrations in the shaying river basin ranged from 0 45 to 1 82 g kg with an average of 1 01 g kg after obtaining the tsn concentrations of the samples the inverse distance weighted idw interpolation method was applied to map the distribution of tsn within 2 17 km grid cells in arcgis 9 3 fig 5 a the highest tsn was recorded in the northwestern part of the shaying river basin along the flow direction tsn concentration generally decreased the lowest values were recorded in the southeastern part of the basin to understand the source of soil nitrogen in this study area better unary and multiple linear regression models were used to explore the relationships among tsn soc nf and cultivation the results showed that the predicted tsn and the observed tsn were significantly and positively correlated fig 5b the value of the dependent variable as a function of the independent variables was best described by tsn 0 025 soc 0 216 r2 0 67 through the unary linear regression model and tsn 0 001 nf 0 064 cultivation 0 707 r2 0 45 through the multiple linear regression model this result demonstrated that there were significant positive relationships among tsn and soc nf and cultivation hence nf and frequent cultivation are the main sources of tsn and contribute to groundwater nitrate groundwater nitrate pollution associated with nf loading and cultivation has also been observed in other studies and areas nolan et al 2002 greene et al 2005 4 4 intrinsic vulnerability of the aquifer the rating and intrinsic vulnerability distributions of the parameters in the drastic model are presented in fig 6 the values vary from 0 to 10 with higher values indicating greater vulnerability of aquifer the parameters of depth to water and net recharge indicated a higher vulnerability with values of 6 10 in the plain area than in the piedmont alluvial fan in contrast the parameters of aquifer water yield property soil media topography and impact of vadose zone showed the opposite tendency areas with higher values and vulnerability were mainly distributed in the recharge area of the piedmont alluvial fan along the groundwater flow direction the aquifer vulnerability decreased gradually with decrease of the value of these parameters from 10 to 1 the value of the hydraulic conductivity parameter indicated that aquifer vulnerability was mainly distributed in the middle and northwestern regions of the shaying river basin although each of these parameters has a specific impact on the vulnerability of the aquifer the real intrinsic vulnerability is the result of the interaction of these parameters the intrinsic vulnerability map of the aquifer was produced by a superposition calculation of each parameter in the drastic model fig 7 a the drastic index di was calculated using eq 2 and normalized to an integer between 0 and 100 using eq 3 aquifer vulnerability was classified into five classes i v very low di 22 3 low di 22 4 35 9 moderate di 36 0 48 3 high di 48 4 63 0 and very high di 63 1 fig 7b the very low intrinsic and low vulnerability areas are distributed mainly in the southeastern part of the shaying river basin and account for approximately 56 8 of the entire study area these areas are mainly related to loam soil media clay vadose zone and the lowest hydraulic conductivity the moderate intrinsic vulnerability area 20 8 of the study area was distributed in the middle of the shaying river basin in this area the parameters depth to water net recharge soil media and impact of vadose zone show almost no significant difference from those in the low vulnerability area however the hydraulic conductivity is almost twice as large as in the low vulnerability area which resulted in the much higher intrinsic vulnerability high and very high intrinsic vulnerability areas 22 4 of the entire study area were distributed mainly in the northwestern part of the shaying river basin loamy sand or sandy loam soil media and coarse sand or gravel vadose zone type have a higher permeability this increases the intrinsic vulnerability of the aquifer 4 5 analysis of influence factors on nitrate pollution to further understand the effects of hydrogeological conditions and surface loads on shallow groundwater nitrate pollution in the shaying river basin the influences of tsn and intrinsic vulnerability on the shallow groundwater nitrate concentration were analyzed significant differences between no3 n and tsn p 0 05 and no3 n and intrinsic vulnerability p 0 05 were found in the shaying river basin meaning that no3 n concentrations were quite variable and affected by a set of factors the lssf model analysis revealed relationships among tsn intrinsic vulnerability and no3 n concentration as shown on the three dimensional coordinate system in fig 8 the results show that no3 n points infinitely approach and fall into a surface dominated by intrinsic vulnerability and tsn with r 2 of 0 89 mse of 0 11 and rmsse of 0 03 fig 8a model residuals are normally distributed fig 8b according to the r2 mse rmsse and model residuals there is a satisfactory goodness of fit for large parts of the groundwater data boy roura et al 2013 the graph from the top down perspective fig 8c shows that there are no3 n points higher than the upper 95 confidence interval whereas the main view fig 8d and left view fig 8e clearly show no3 n points both inside of and outside of the 95 confidence interval even though some of the no3 n points did not fall onto the surface the no3 n points on the surface explain 83 5 of the variance within the 95 confidence interval this result reveals that the groundwater no3 n pollution is simultaneously controlled by surface nitrogen loads and hydrogeological conditions theoretically areas with higher intrinsic vulnerability and surface nitrogen loads can lead to serious nitrate pollution of groundwater greene et al 2005 nolan and hitt 2006 a comparison of figs 4 5 and 7 shows that many of the no3 n pollution points in the shaying river basin are distributed in areas with high or moderate surface nitrogen loads and high or moderate intrinsic vulnerability this result is caused by the cumulative effect of vulnerable hydrogeological conditions on surface nitrogen loads in addition a small portion of the no3 n pollution points are distributed in low vulnerability areas with moderate surface nitrogen loads although andrade and stigter 2009 concluded that dilution by surface water played a role in the attenuation of pollutant infiltration into groundwater and debernardi et al 2008 felt that low intrinsic vulnerability was important no3 n pollution is simultaneously controlled by intrinsic vulnerability and surface nitrogen loads hence groundwater nitrate pollution can also occur in areas of low vulnerability due to the long term retention of high or moderate surface loads 4 6 validation of the results although the groundwater nitrate pollution has been proven to be controlled by hydrogeological conditions and surface loads simultaneously as validated by r2 mse rmsse and their residuals further validation is required due to the limitations of these parameters kura et al 2015 arauzo 2017 therefore 10 shallow groundwater samples along section a a fig 1 from ye county were used to validate the result further the validation results in fig 9 show that the groundwater no3 n pollution was distributed at the points with moderate or high intrinsic vulnerability and moderate total soil nitrogen due to the cumulative effect in addition high total soil nitrogen can lead to an increase of no3 n at points of low intrinsic vulnerability due to long term retention these results once again confirm that the groundwater no3 n pollution is simultaneously controlled by surface nitrogen loads and hydrogeological conditions 5 conclusion the least squares surface fitting model predicted a surface that could well fit groundwater nitrate pollution through surface loads and intrinsic vulnerability it proved that the groundwater nitrate pollution in the shaying river basin is simultaneously controlled by surface loads and hydrogeological conditions with an 83 5 interpretation rate it is easy to understand and widely accepted that surface loads affect groundwater pollution the tsn came mainly from inputs of agricultural nitrogen fertilizer and livestock manure and it is the main source of nitrate in the groundwater a novel finding is that the hydrogeological conditions represented by intrinsic vulnerability also play an important role in affecting groundwater nitrate pollution and that its influence tendency is nonlinear this finding explained the phenomenon of some areas having high surface loads but no serious groundwater nitrate pollution and some areas having nitrate pollution but no high surface loads based on this work it was verified that serious groundwater nitrate pollution not only existed in high vulnerability areas with moderate or low surface loads but also existed in low vulnerability areas with high surface loads in analyses of the genesis of groundwater pollution the comprehensive influence of surface loads and hydrogeological conditions must be considered simultaneously it is insufficient to consider only one sided factors this finding provides helpful information for managing and controlling groundwater quality by reducing surface nitrogen sources and minimizing human activities in high vulnerability areas acknowledgements this study was financially supported by the project of china geological survey 1212011121170 appendix a supplementary data the following are the supplementary data

18598,the seasonal and diurnal patterns of n nitrosomorpholine nmor and its formation potential nmor fp were examined with water samples taken from five outlets of four sewage treatment plants stps seven main stream sites and five tributary sites in the yodo river basin stps were shown to be the main sources of downstream nmor load the highest nmor levels were found in the discharge from one stp 26 4 171 ng l continuous sequential samplings over a period of 24 h at this stp revealed that nmor flux at the influent point fluctuated in both summer 0 4 3 2 g h and winter 0 3 5 4 g h while it was steady in the effluent in addition levels of nmor remained stable during the biological treatment and disinfection processes the present research demonstrated that nmor could be formed from morpholine mor in raw sewage treated by this stp with a possible mechanism being formaldehyde catalyzed nitrosation of mor by nitrites prior to raw sewage entering the stp this implies that the nmor detected here might not be a disinfection byproduct per se under low chlorine disinfection around 1 0 mg l but is primarily a contaminant that is difficult to remove during sewage treatment nmor attenuated significantly in the rivers in the daytime with production of mor but persisted during nights which demonstrated the importance of monitoring nmor levels in the water environment during periods of low uv intensity especially nights graphical abstract image 1 keywords n nitrosomorpholine morpholine occurrence fate formation potential nitrosation mechanism 1 introduction n nitrosomorpholine nmor is classified as a group 2b carcinogen possibly carcinogenic to humans who 1987 and has a 10 6 cancer risk level of 0 8 ng l in drinking water gwrc 2007 a guideline value of no more than 10 ng l of nmor in drinking water has been recommended in germany planas et al 2008 while australia has established guideline values of 1 ng l for water recycling nhmrc 2008 nmor and n nitrosodimethylamine ndma are the most frequently detected nitrosamines in urban water systems with concentrations from a few ng l up to more than 10 000 ng l gwrc 2007 krasner et al 2009 krauss et al 2009 bond et al 2011 ma et al 2012 bei et al 2016 takeuchi et al 2018 however the level of contamination and extent of nmor in surface waters is still unclear due to the limited information about its sources in addition unlike ndma which is a known disinfection byproduct dbp there are conflicting reports as to whether nmor forms as a dbp schreiber and mitch 2006 or is present as a contaminant krasner et al 2013 because nmor is frequently detected before disinfection in sewage treatment plants stps influenced by anthropogenic discharges krauss et al 2009 yoon et al 2013 recent research glover et al 2019 offers further evidence that nmor is not likely a dbp but is primarily a contaminant in the united states one known precursor is morpholine mor which can form nmor through nitrosation in the liquid phase mirvish 1975 and gas phase mirvish et al 1988 mor is classified as a group 3 carcinogen not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans who 1999 and it is used in huge volumes in various industries as an intermediate compound or solvent huntsman 2005 prtr 2016 the nitrosation of mor with nitrites is favored at acidic ph kumar and kapur 2016 chandan et al 2013 and is facilitated by carbonyl compounds such as formaldehyde fah by interacting with secondary amines to form an adduct that is highly reactive toward nucleophilic attack by nitrites under neutral and alkaline ph conditions keeper and roller 1973 casado et al 1984 thus if the necessary conditions are fulfilled fah catalyzed nitrosation of mor supplementary information s1 could occur unintentionally within industries that use mor within sewerage networks or once it is released into the aquatic environment as the catalyst fah is a raw material used in many different industries and is frequently detected in wastewaters eiroa et al 2005 tang et al 2009 nmor is frequently detected in wastewater schreiber and mitch 2006 vocht et al 2007 krasner et al 2009 and has been found both in wastewater impacted by industry lee and oh 2016 and in purely domestic non industrially impacted wastewater zeng and mitch 2015 due to its low removal efficiency during wastewater treatment krauss et al 2009 nmor can pass through stps and be discharged into surface waters posing a great risk to downstream drinking water utilities krasner et al 2013 glover et al 2019 even without significant use of chlorine or chloramine for disinfection krauss et al 2009 in addition the precursor mor also has been detected in stp discharge river water river sediment and drinking water akyuz and ata 2006 ma et al 2012 shah and mitch 2012 kodamatani et al 2017 although recent reports have shown that nmor and mor can be removed by advanced wastewater treatments e g advanced oxidation processes and membrane filtration as end of pipe treatments fujioka et al 2018 takeuchi et al 2018 glover et al 2019 source control for both mor and nmor is important because it is impossible to upgrade the systems in all stps the persistence of nmor and its precursors in surface waters impacted by discharge from stps is of concern for communities exploiting such waters therefore studying the fates of nmor and mor during wastewater treatment is of importance as more and more municipal water treatment plants are engaged in the practice of intentional or unintentional reuse of the treated wastewater considering possible future regulations it is worth estimating the fate and concentration of nmor in urban water systems comprehensive studies detailing factors that affect the natural degradation of nmor in surface waters are lacking in the literature and to the best of our knowledge this is the first research to address the impact of nitrite and fah on nmor formation from mor in sewerage networks the main objectives of this study were to i explore the fate of nmor and nmor formation potential nmor fp in a full scale stp ii demonstrate the mechanisms of nitrosation of mor in aquatic environments that can lead to the formation or release of nmor iii clarify seasonal and diurnal variations in levels of nmor and its precursors by measuring nmor fp in various surface waters and iv investigate the attenuation of nmor in surface waters combined with batch tests 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and sampling the yodo river basin is one of japan s major basins covering an area of 8240 km2 extending over the shiga kyoto and osaka prefectures and it is home to approximately 10 of japan s population water samples were collected at 17 sites on the yodo river basin figs 1 and s1 including five stp effluents seven main streams and five tributaries the effluents were sampled from four stps which represent major stps in the central yodo river basin among the four stps stp a stp c and stp d use a conventional activated sludge cas process for secondary treatment whereas stp b uses three different treatments including a cas process an anaerobic oxic process and a recycled nitrification step feed biological nitrogen removal process in terms of disinfection stp a uses ozonation while the other stps use chlorination surveys for samplings were conducted from may 2017 to october 2018 during periods of no rainfall in the present study we focused on stp b because the frequency of nmor detection and the levels of nmor in its discharges were far higher than in the other stps and because it serves most of the population in the catchment which plays an important role in water quality especially in the downstream sites of the yodo river the plant is the largest stp in kyoto prefecture with a treatment volume of 539 480 m3 d table s1 predominantly treating domestic wastewater plus a share of commercial and industrial wastewater travel time of sewage from the farthest distance through the pipelines of the service area to stp b around 13 km is about 6 h during the dry season kcwb 2017 this time was calculated by the designed flow velocity 0 6 3 0 m s of sewage in kyoto city kcow 2016 stp b has two major influent lines lines b 1 and b 2 servicing roughly two sewered areas with outlets to 11 treatment lines consisting of primary settling tanks and biological treatment tanks as secondary treatment final effluent from the b 1 and b 2 lines is discharged into the nishitakase river b s1 and the katsura river b s2 respectively tables s1 and s2 to investigate the fates of target compounds in stp b continuous samplings were conducted once every hour over a 24 h period at several points along line b 2 listed below under dry weather conditions in the middle of the week by using automatic samplers model 6712 full size portable sampler teledyne isco lincoln ne usa in addition grab samplings were also carried out for investigation of nmor and mor in stp b samples were taken from influent raw sewage primary effluent just after the primary sedimentation tank influent just before the aeration tank effluent just after the aeration tank secondary effluent just after the secondary sedimentation tank influent just before the disinfection tank effluent just after the disinfection tank and final discharge outlet of stp b the flow rates at the river water sampling sites k 1m k 3t k 2m u m ki m and y m were obtained from measurements taken at gauging stations by the ministry of land infrastructure and transport japan 2 2 analytical methods each sample was firstly filtered through a glass fiber filter gf b 1 0 μm pore size whatman osaka japan after addition of isotope labelled surrogate nmor d 8 purchased from cdn isotopes pointe claire pq canada as an internal standard nmor was analyzed by solid phase extraction spe liquid chromatograph tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms the spe process was modified slightly from that of our previous study yoon et al 2013 detailed procedures for nmor analysis are described in supplementary information s3 mor was determined directly by lc ms ms analysis after filtration through a sterile pes syringe filter 0 22 μm 13 mm membrane solutions plano tx usa without spe fah was measured following the method of a previous study sugaya et al 2001 by using headspace gas chromatography gc ms from 10 ml unfiltered samples without sample concentration detailed analytical parameters for nmor mor and fah are summarized in tables s3 s5 and analytical accuracy test data for nmor using different types of water samples are summarized in table s6 standard solutions of nmor and fah were purchased from supelco bellefonte pa usa while mor standard solution 99 was purchased from alfa aesar heysham england dichloromethane was obtained from wako pure chemical industries osaka japan ultrapure water milli q was obtained from milli q plus millipore billerica ma usa total organic carbon toc was measured with a toc 300 v analyzer mitsubishi chemical analytech kanagawa japan sodium nitrite nano2 solution was purchased from wako pure chemical industries 2 3 nmor fp tests 2 3 1 nmor fp of environmental samples by chloramination fpnh2cl the potential for nmor to form by chloramination fpnh2cl in environmental samples was defined as the increase in nmor concentration after 10 days the procedure for the test followed that of other studies mitch et al 2003 with a minor modification yoon et al 2011 a 20 mm stock solution of monochloramine nh2cl was prepared for chloramination unfiltered water samples 900 ml with ph adjusted to 7 0 were dosed with 100 ml of monochloramine stock solution final concentration of 2 0 mm or 142 mg l as cl2 and then the samples were stored in 1 l sealed amber bottles with teflon lined screw caps at 25 c for 10 days shielded from light after 10 days incubation residual chloramine was quenched by adding excess sodium thiosulfate and then the samples were processed for nmor analysis 2 3 2 nmor fp of mor by chloramination fpnh2cl and chlorination fpcl the potential for nmor to form with chloramination of mor fpnh2cl of mor was also defined and tested like the test for environmental samples above with a minor modification mor was added to the solutions dosed with the monochloramine stock solution to the initial mor concentrations of 0 57 μm equal to 50 μg l or 1 15 μm equal to 100 μg l and initial chloramine concentration of 2 0 mm or 142 mg l as cl2 aliquots of 1 l ultrapure water without mor only chloramine and without chloramine only mor were also processed using the same procedure to serve as controls to evaluate the actual disinfection conditions operating in stp b table s2 nmor fpcl chlorination 1 0 mg l as cl2 of mor was defined as the increase in nmor concentration after 15 30 and 60 min compared to 0 min at each contact time residual chlorine was quenched by adding excess sodium thiosulfate and then the samples were immediately processed for analysis of formed nmor and residual mor aliquots of 1 l ultrapure water without mor only chlorine and without chlorine only mor were also processed using the same procedure to serve as controls the fp of mor was evaluated from percent molar yield by the following equation 1 m o l a r y i e l d c n m o r c m o r 100 where cnmor is the final molar concentration of nmor and cmor is the initial designed molar concentration of mor 2 3 3 evaluation of nmor formation from mor with nitrite catalyzed by fah nmor formation via fah catalyzed nitrosation was tested mor nitrite and fah stock solution were prepared in ultrapure water to 100 mg l both for nitrite and fah by dilution from standard solutions of nano2 1000 mg l and fah 1000 mg l respectively the effects of mor 1 100 μm nitrite 1 100 μm and fah 1 100 μm concentrations on the formation of nmor from mor were studied in ultrapure water solutions with ph adjusted to 7 0 by 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer the formation of nmor was monitored after 0 25 days equal to 6 h and 1 day for comparison and the nmor concentrations were compared with the individual initial concentrations the effect of ph was studied by incubating ultrapure water with ph adjusted by sodium phosphate buffer ph 3 0 7 0 and 10 0 containing 100 μm mor 100 μm nitrite and 100 μm fah moreover we performed the same test using a 24 h composite sample of influent b 2 of stp b collected on july 11 12 2018 to confirm the effect of the matrix on different initial concentrations 1 100 μm of mor all reactions were maintained in sealed amber bottles with teflon lined screw caps at 25 c shielded from light to control the contact time all samples were pretreated by spe within 1 h of sampling the result was evaluated in molar yield of nmor by equation 1 2 4 biodegradation and photodegradation tests to estimate the attenuation of nmor by bioactivity during river transport biodegradation tests were conducted in accordance with the u s environmental protection agency s test guideline 835 3170 epa 1998b surface water samples were collected at k 2t tributary and k 2m main stream in november 2017 moreover because photolysis is very effective for removal of nmor on summer days with half life t 1 2 of about 17 min sørensen et al 2013 direct photolysis tests were conducted in accordance with the u s environmental protection agency s test guideline 835 2210 epa 1998a to evaluate the natural attenuation of nmor by weak solar irradiation on winter middays december 2018 the methods of these two experiments are described in supplementary information s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and fate of nmor in stp b large variations in nmor concentration are reported not only among different stps during the wastewater treatment processes including primary and secondary treatments krauss and hollender 2008 yoon et al 2013 lee and oh 2016 but also among individual measurements within the same stp krauss et al 2009 despite some parts of the treatment process being the same the occurrence of nmor at the two outlets of stp b b s1 and b s2 was totally different table s7 moreover the results at several points along the two treatment lines of stp b revealed higher concentrations of nmor on the b 2 line than on the b 1 line and a possible increase in nmor occurring during processes along the b 2 line especially the disinfection process which will be further discussed in the following sections based on investigations for each treatment unit along the b 2 line the results implied that nmor and its precursors flow directly into stp b 3 1 1 fluctuation of nmor in influent of stp b because levels of industrial vs domestic input in wastewater can influence the concentrations of nmor in combined wastewater lee and oh 2016 it is likely that influent b 2 includes more discharge from industries involved with mor usage e g dyes rubber and tires fajen et al 1979 kumar and kapur 2016 beita sandí et al 2019 than influent b 1 due to the high fluctuations of nmor table s7 as well as fah influent b 2 was sampled every hour for 24 h in summer july 11 12 2018 and winter december 14 15 2017 mass flux was then calculated based on the concentrations and hourly flow rates in these two surveys nmor showed a clear daily peak in hourly mass flux with hourly mass flux ranging from 0 3 to 5 4 g h in winter fig 2 a and 0 4 3 2 g h in summer fig 2b although some samples could not be collected due to the sampler being blocked by suspended garbage based on results from hourly mass flux it is likely that grab sampling of influent would not accurately capture the fate of nmor in stp b table s7 fah was also detected every hour in winter december 14 15 2017 winter fah showed a clear peak in hourly mass flux range 0 2 5 1 kg h fig s2 although fah could not be analyzed after may 2018 due to a mechanical problem it is likely that fah would be one of the most frequently detected contaminants with 10 μg l in the wastewater all the time table s7 and fig s2 nmor fpnh2cl was not detectable no increase in the concentration of nmor after chloramination either in the influents or in effluents among the 24 h continuous samplings in addition mor was not detected during the 24 h in influent or effluent sampling which might be caused by low concentrations of mor among the samplings the peak of nmor mass flux would imply a specific source of nmor e g industrial or commercial discharge and a regular discharge as is seen with other compounds e g pharmaceuticals and fragrances joss et al 2005 the seasonal pattern of nmor in influent might mainly be caused by flow volumes which could also be one reason for the seasonal pattern in effluent table s7 moreover the higher flow rate in summer might produce the quicker peak time of the nmor mass flux in summer than that in winter 3 1 2 evaluation of nmor formation from mor by fah catalyzed nitrosation as discussed above monitoring at stp b clearly showed the direct flow of nmor into the plant which led us to clarify whether nmor is released directly into the sewers or is formed between the source of nmor precursors and the stp various chemicals especially mor and its derivatives with a morpholine group alkaissi et al 2015 can form nmor kumar and kapur 2016 according to the 2016 japanese pollutant release and transfer register mor was discharged at a rate of 32 6 tonne year and stps received about 10 of that discharge prtr 2016 however mor was not detected in most of the grab samples or the 24 h continuous samplings either in the influent or the effluent of the plant which might be a result of the limitation of mor detection the limit of quantification loq was 0 9 μg l other possibilities include fluctuating levels of mor released from the sources and or the consumption of mor by nitrosation or nitration within the several hours before coming into the stp as has been observed in carbon dioxide capture with excess nitrite and fah in the system dai et al 2012 in other words it is plausible that a large quantity of nmor could be formed in sewerage pipes as a result of fah catalyzed nitrosation before flowing into stps however fluctuating levels of mor were observed among the different sampling events along line 2 of stp b which might reflect fluctuating release from industries or unstable consumption during transport through the sewerage pipes mor was not detected in influent and effluent of the b 2 line on december 14 and 15 2017 whereas it had been detected before and after the disinfection tank on november 7 and 8 2017 discussed in section 3 1 4 we considered that nitrosation of mor to nmor was likely to have occurred in the sewer system because fah table s7 and fig s2 and nitrite table s1 were both detected in the influent of stp b at μg l and sub mg l levels respectively we confirmed that the formation of nmor from mor by nitrosation could be influenced by the initial concentrations of mor fig s4a nitrite fig s4b and fah fig s4c in ultrapure water moreover acidic conditions ph 3 0 facilitated the formation of nmor fig s4d in ultrapure water although the ph of influent b 2 was nearly neutral table s1 therefore to test our hypothesis nmor formation from mor in three different matrices ultrapure water only influent only ultrapure water with 100 μm nitrite and 100 μm fah was tested with the same initial concentrations of mor 1 10 and 100 μm and at constant ph 7 0 and temperature 25 c for 0 25 and 1 days the formation of nmor in influent of stp b line b 2 was less than that in the ultrapure water plus 100 μm fah and 100 μm nitrite at 0 25 days fig 3 a which was caused by the difference in levels of fah and nitrite in the influent of line b 2 both fah concentration ranging from 10 to 300 μg l equal to 0 3 10 μm table s7 and nitrite with maximum value of 0 1 mg l equal to 2 2 μm table s1 were much lower than 100 μm however by 1 day the level of nmor formation in the influent group with 100 μm mor was the same as that in the ultrapure water plus nitrite and fah group fig 3b indicating that the b 2 influent had different conditions for nmor formation because raw sewage generally has a more complicated matrix there is likely to be other catalysts e g acetaldehyde and other nitrosation agents e g n2o3 and n2o4 helping to increase the nmor formation as the time increases dai et al 2012 chandan et al 2013 nitrite was identified as one key factor contributing to the nmor formation as well as mor because different performance was confirmed in other influents collected from three different plants outside of the research area before and after the addition of nitrite fig s5 however more studies are needed in the future to further investigate the conditions in sewerage pipelines that influence the mechanisms of nmor formation and to locate the point sources of mor nmor discharge from factories 3 1 3 occurrence and fate of nmor in biological treatment at stp b although we found that nmor levels in the influent samples fluctuated it was still interesting that the nmor concentrations were higher in grab samples of effluent than in the influent table s7 both in the b 1 line and the b 2 line in stp b during the 24 h continuous samplings of influent in july 2017 corresponding sampling for final effluent was conducted for the b 2 line taking retention time into consideration the results showed that the unstable inputs of nmor fig 2b might become blended within the subsequent treatment units in the plant fig s3 leading to a more stable mass flux of nmor in the effluent although degradation or formation of nmor might also happen during the treatment therefore we investigated the fate of nmor in each of the main treatment units biological treatment and disinfection process by sampling every hour for 24 h among the eight nitrosamines that have been studied the removal rates during biotreatment are the lowest for nmor krauss et al 2009 gerrity et al 2015 one possible reason is that nmor possesses within its structure the weak electron donating functional group morpholine wijekoon et al 2013 krauss et al also reported that the removal efficiency of nmor varied significantly between stps as well as within the same stp over time and that a cas system with a nitrification step was beneficial for nmor removal krauss et al 2009 although nmor generally shows poor removal the reasons for the fluctuating removal levels were still not clear to understand the effect of biological treatment on nmor removal in stp b two auto samplers were set one before and one after biological treatment using recycled nitrification and a step feed biological nitrogen removal process line 8 on the b 2 line table s2 and samples were collected every hour for 24 h the concentration of nmor was 31 8 65 8 ng l in the influent fig 4 a and 38 5 84 0 ng l in the effluent fig 4b of the aeration tank indicating either formation of nmor or no change during nitrification rather than removal since there is a certain threshold concentration of enzymes necessary for nmor transformation bosma et al 1997 and limited biodegradation by biological filters glover et al 2019 the nitrification process line 8 was not sufficient to decompose nmor the nmor concentration in the influent to the biological treatment unit fig 4a could be affected by the peak in the hourly mass flux of nmor in the influent line to the plant fig 2 the increase in the concentration in the effluent from the biological treatment unit might be due to continuous or intermittent additional input of nmor via return sludge a follow up survey was conducted for activated sludge and return sludge collected as grab samples from all lines of the b 2 line in all lines the concentrations of nmor in the aqueous phase of the sludges were similar table s8 considering the high hydrophilicity of nmor these results would imply that nmor was circulated in the aeration tank and that the tank stabilizes the fluctuations of nmor concentration that were observed in the influent in contrast fah was detected with a range of 8 8 73 5 μg l in the influent to the aeration tank but was not detected after biotreatment 1 0 μg l fig s6 the result clearly showed the much higher biodegradability of fah than nmor as reported in both aerobic eiroa et al 2005 and anaerobic systems garrido et al 2001 3 1 4 occurrence and fate of nmor in disinfection tanks of stp b in general there is almost no nmor fp by the oxidants used as disinfectants e g ozonation chlorine or chloramine in secondary effluent stp discharge or surface waters krauss et al 2010 shah et al 2012 woods et al 2015 nmor was observed before the disinfection tank fig 5a1 with no significant change during the disinfection process fig 5a2 by multiplying the concentration of nmor observed in five grab samplings 2 times in winter and 3 times in summer by the flow rate at each sampling time table s9 and considering the retention time of disinfection average value of 0 5 h we calculated the values of nmor that we expected to see at point 5 immediately downstream from the confluence of effluent from all disinfection tanks on the b 2 line fig s7 the values of nmor observed at point 5 were only slightly higher 0 6 13 8 than the predicted values fig s8 because there was little or no formation during the disinfection process in this study this implies that nmor was mainly present as a daily micropollutant from wastewaters resulting from human activities krauss et al 2009 rather than a dbp the low transformation rate from mor to nmor even under excess chloramination and moderate chlorination figs s9 and s10 might explain why there is little or no formation of nmor during the actual disinfection process in stp b 3 2 occurrence and distribution of nmor in surface waters of the yodo river basin levels of nmor detected by monitoring in the yodo river basin between may 2017 and october 2018 are presented in fig 6 details in table s10 the highest concentration of nmor detected in stp discharges based on the median values was observed at b s2 with 62 1 ng l detected 20 times out of 20 sampling events followed by 16 1 ng l at c s 10 10 13 4 ng l at d s 10 10 4 0 ng l at b s1 12 12 and 1 6 ng l at a s 9 10 it should be noted that although the highest concentrations of nmor 26 4 171 ng l table s10 with 100 detection frequency were found at b s2 the outlet of stp b to the katsura river this was not the case at the other outlet of stp b b s1 discussed above for b s2 a higher mean value was observed in winter 112 45 0 ng l n 6 than in summer 51 3 16 9 ng l n 10 which was coincident with the seasonal pattern in influent b 2 fig 2 this seasonal pattern was observed at c s too at most river sampling points the median concentration of nmor was below 10 ng l which might be due to dilution or attenuation by sunlight sørensen et al 2013 at the midstream point k 2m nmor ranged from 0 9 to 32 2 ng l nmor was still detected at the most downstream site y m in this study which was close to the uptake point for a drinking water treatment plant nmor at y m ranged from 0 7 to 4 8 ng l with 67 detection frequency nmor fpnh2cl was not detectable either in the river water or in wastewater effluents in any of the surveys table s10 which might be because of low levels of precursors for example mor was detected at 3 8 μg l at b s2 data not shown but was not detected in surface waters in a previous study kodamatani et al 2017 up to 0 8 μg l of mor was detected in treated wastewater but there was also no detection in river water or sea water 3 3 fate of nmor in the yodo river basin and results of batch tests on attenuation of nmor seasonal and diurnal differences in the nmor concentrations in river samples could be affected by flow rate removal efficiency environmental fate and patterns of discharge of nmor into within and from stps to estimate the natural attenuation and contribution of nmor in main streams influenced by stps the mass balance of nmor in the study area was calculated based on mass flux at each site by multiplying the detected concentration by the mean river flow rate per day or the mean stp discharge in terms of cubic meters of effluent per day because sampling was carried out during periods of no rainfall the flow rate at k 2t was the sum of those at a s and b s1 flow rates at each stp were obtained from the local government the flow rates are summarized in table s11 the system boundary of the region from the upstream was set at two reference points including the middle k 2m and the most downstream site y m k 4t and y t each had small flow volume with low frequency and low concentration of nmor and were ignored in the mass balance calculations as a result b s2 discharged from stp b was the major source of nmor in the study area showing seasonal patterns of higher mass flux of nmor in winter 41 4 16 1 g d n 6 than in summer 24 8 7 3 g d n 9 table s12 to protect downstream water quality it is necessary to determine the factors that affect the mass flow of nmor at each site by examining the differences between summer daytime sd summer night sn winter daytime wd and winter night wn measurements mass flux of nmor discharged from stp b b s2 showed higher diurnal values in the daytime than that at night fig 7 as shown in fig 7 seasonal and diurnal patterns of attenuation of nmor were observed during the river transport by comparison of mass flux between b s2 and two downstream reference points k 2m and y m nmor remained at k 2m and y m at night sn and wn with lower or no attenuation compared with that in the daytime day sd and wd indicating that solar intensity could be an important factor for degradation of nmor on the other hand higher attenuation of nmor happened in sd than in wd which might be caused by the greatly different uv intensity between summer and winter hanamoto et al 2013 direct photolysis experiments showed nmor to be photodegradable with a half life t 1 2 of 47 3 min for the irradiation conditions of midday sunlight in ultrapure water in winter fig s11a the value of t 1 2 was much greater about 3 fold than that in summer midday sørensen et al 2013 in contrast no biodegradation of nmor was found in the environmental samples fig s12 therefore from the viewpoint of the conservation of water quality at drinking water sources more attention needs to be paid to periods in which uv is weak such as at night or when conditions are bad for photolysis e g cloudy high levels of dom and suspended solids increased water depth in winter on the other hand mor was not degraded by photoirradiation under the same conditions fig s11b moreover mor was formed from the photolysis of nmor with a formation of about 0 28 μg mor μg nmor during 60 min fig s11a this indicates that even though nmor is photodegradable there is still a risk of pollution from the precursor mor and nmor in downstream waters 4 conclusions the chemical mor is the primary precursor involved in the unintentional formation of the possibly carcinogenic compound nmor which is difficult to remove during conventional wastewater treatment processes in this study nmor mainly came from the area serviced by stp b which implies that nmor is a contaminant with an industrial source in the study area the removal of nmor during the treatment processes at this stp was very low or none the present research clearly exhibited the possibility that unintentional nitrosation of mor via fah catalyzed nitrosation of mor by nitrite to form nmor could occur inside of industries that use mor or during transportation in sewerage pipelines the nmor detected here did not appear to be a dbp per se under conditions of low chlorine disinfection around 1 0 mg l although mor was detected in secondary effluent at levels of a few tens of micrograms per liter the frequency of detection of nmor was high in the yodo river basin especially in the effluent of the stps studied 80 the highest nmor level was found in effluent from stp b 26 4 171 ng l combined with results about mass balance of nmor low nmor removal was found in surface waters during periods of low uv intensity especially in winter when there was a higher mass load of nmor discharge sharing of information between industries discharging industrial effluent that might contain mor or nmor sewerage system operators and water suppliers is important for the protection of safe drinking water at downstream sites furthermore the social responsibility of source control of mor at industries that use the substance is probably needed more than end of pipe control by upgrading stps acknowledgments we acknowledge the long range research initiative of the japan chemical industry association jcia pt04 01 and the environment

18598,the seasonal and diurnal patterns of n nitrosomorpholine nmor and its formation potential nmor fp were examined with water samples taken from five outlets of four sewage treatment plants stps seven main stream sites and five tributary sites in the yodo river basin stps were shown to be the main sources of downstream nmor load the highest nmor levels were found in the discharge from one stp 26 4 171 ng l continuous sequential samplings over a period of 24 h at this stp revealed that nmor flux at the influent point fluctuated in both summer 0 4 3 2 g h and winter 0 3 5 4 g h while it was steady in the effluent in addition levels of nmor remained stable during the biological treatment and disinfection processes the present research demonstrated that nmor could be formed from morpholine mor in raw sewage treated by this stp with a possible mechanism being formaldehyde catalyzed nitrosation of mor by nitrites prior to raw sewage entering the stp this implies that the nmor detected here might not be a disinfection byproduct per se under low chlorine disinfection around 1 0 mg l but is primarily a contaminant that is difficult to remove during sewage treatment nmor attenuated significantly in the rivers in the daytime with production of mor but persisted during nights which demonstrated the importance of monitoring nmor levels in the water environment during periods of low uv intensity especially nights graphical abstract image 1 keywords n nitrosomorpholine morpholine occurrence fate formation potential nitrosation mechanism 1 introduction n nitrosomorpholine nmor is classified as a group 2b carcinogen possibly carcinogenic to humans who 1987 and has a 10 6 cancer risk level of 0 8 ng l in drinking water gwrc 2007 a guideline value of no more than 10 ng l of nmor in drinking water has been recommended in germany planas et al 2008 while australia has established guideline values of 1 ng l for water recycling nhmrc 2008 nmor and n nitrosodimethylamine ndma are the most frequently detected nitrosamines in urban water systems with concentrations from a few ng l up to more than 10 000 ng l gwrc 2007 krasner et al 2009 krauss et al 2009 bond et al 2011 ma et al 2012 bei et al 2016 takeuchi et al 2018 however the level of contamination and extent of nmor in surface waters is still unclear due to the limited information about its sources in addition unlike ndma which is a known disinfection byproduct dbp there are conflicting reports as to whether nmor forms as a dbp schreiber and mitch 2006 or is present as a contaminant krasner et al 2013 because nmor is frequently detected before disinfection in sewage treatment plants stps influenced by anthropogenic discharges krauss et al 2009 yoon et al 2013 recent research glover et al 2019 offers further evidence that nmor is not likely a dbp but is primarily a contaminant in the united states one known precursor is morpholine mor which can form nmor through nitrosation in the liquid phase mirvish 1975 and gas phase mirvish et al 1988 mor is classified as a group 3 carcinogen not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans who 1999 and it is used in huge volumes in various industries as an intermediate compound or solvent huntsman 2005 prtr 2016 the nitrosation of mor with nitrites is favored at acidic ph kumar and kapur 2016 chandan et al 2013 and is facilitated by carbonyl compounds such as formaldehyde fah by interacting with secondary amines to form an adduct that is highly reactive toward nucleophilic attack by nitrites under neutral and alkaline ph conditions keeper and roller 1973 casado et al 1984 thus if the necessary conditions are fulfilled fah catalyzed nitrosation of mor supplementary information s1 could occur unintentionally within industries that use mor within sewerage networks or once it is released into the aquatic environment as the catalyst fah is a raw material used in many different industries and is frequently detected in wastewaters eiroa et

discharged into surface waters posing a great risk to downstream drinking water utilities krasner et al 2013 glover et al 2019 even without significant use of chlorine or chloramine for disinfection

et al 2018 takeuchi et al 2018 glover et al 2019 source control for both mor and nmor is important because it is impossible to upgrade the systems in all stps the persistence of nmor and its precursors in surface waters impacted by discharge from stps is of concern for communities exploiting such waters therefore studying the fates of nmor and mor during wastewater treatment is of importance as more and more municipal water treatment plants are engaged in the practice of intentional or unintentional reuse of the treated wastewater considering possible future regulations it is worth estimating the fate and concentration of nmor in urban water systems comprehensive studies detailing factors that affect the natural degradation of nmor in surface waters are lacking in the literature and to the best of our knowledge this is the first research to address the impact of nitrite and fah on nmor formation from mor in sewerage networks the main objectives of this study were to i explore the fate of nmor and nmor formation potential nmor fp in a full scale stp ii demonstrate the mechanisms of nitrosation of mor in aquatic environments that can lead to the formation or release of nmor iii clarify seasonal and diurnal variations in levels of nmor and its precursors by measuring nmor fp in various surface waters and iv investigate the attenuation of nmor in surface waters combined with batch tests 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and sampling the yodo river basin is one of japan s major basins covering an area of 8240 km2 extending over the shiga kyoto and osaka prefectures and it is home to approximately 10 of japan s population water samples were collected at 17 sites on the yodo river basin figs 1 and s1 including five stp effluents seven main streams and five tributaries the effluents were sampled from four stps which represent major stps in the central yodo river basin among the four stps stp a stp c and stp d use a conventional activated sludge cas process for secondary treatment whereas stp b uses three different treatments including a cas process an anaerobic oxic process and a recycled nitrification step feed biological nitrogen removal process in terms of disinfection stp a uses ozonation while the other stps use chlorination surveys for samplings were conducted from may 2017 to october 2018 during periods of no rainfall in the present study we focused on stp b because the frequency of nmor detection and the levels of nmor in its discharges were far higher than in the other stps and because it serves most of the population in the catchment which plays an important role in water quality especially in the downstream sites of the yodo river the plant is the largest stp in kyoto prefecture with a treatment volume of 539 480 m3 d table s1 predominantly treating domestic wastewater plus a share of commercial and industrial wastewater travel time of sewage from the farthest distance through the pipelines of the service area to stp b around 13 km is about 6 h during the dry season kcwb 2017 this time was calculated by the designed flow velocity 0 6 3 0 m s of sewage in kyoto city kcow 2016 stp b has two major influent lines lines b 1 and b 2 servicing roughly two sewered areas with outlets to 11 treatment lines consisting of primary settling tanks and biological treatment tanks as secondary treatment final effluent from the b 1 and b 2 lines is discharged into the nishitakase river b s1 and the katsura river b s2 respectively tables s1 and s2 to investigate the fates of target compounds in stp b continuous samplings were conducted once every hour over a 24 h period at several points along line b 2 listed below under dry weather conditions in the middle of the week by using automatic samplers model 6712 full size portable sampler teledyne isco lincoln ne usa in addition grab samplings were also carried out for investigation of nmor and mor in stp b samples were taken from influent raw sewage primary effluent just after the primary sedimentation tank influent just before the aeration tank effluent just after the aeration tank secondary effluent just after the secondary sedimentation tank influent just before the disinfection tank effluent just after the disinfection tank and final discharge outlet of stp b the flow rates at the river water sampling sites k 1m k 3t k 2m u m ki m and y m were obtained from measurements taken at gauging stations by the ministry of land infrastructure and transport japan 2 2 analytical methods each sample was firstly filtered through a glass fiber filter gf b 1 0 μm pore size whatman osaka japan after addition of isotope labelled surrogate nmor d 8 purchased from cdn isotopes pointe claire pq canada as an internal standard nmor was analyzed by solid phase extraction spe liquid chromatograph tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms the spe process was modified slightly from that of our previous study yoon et al 2013 detailed procedures for nmor analysis are described in supplementary information s3 mor was determined directly by lc ms ms analysis after filtration through a sterile pes syringe filter 0 22 μm 13 mm membrane solutions plano tx usa without spe fah was measured following the method of a previous study sugaya et al 2001 by using headspace gas chromatography gc ms from 10 ml unfiltered samples without sample concentration detailed analytical parameters for nmor mor and fah are summarized in tables s3 s5 and analytical accuracy test data for nmor using different types of water samples are summarized in table s6 standard solutions of nmor and fah were purchased from supelco bellefonte pa usa while mor standard solution 99 was purchased from alfa aesar heysham england dichloromethane was obtained from wako pure chemical industries osaka japan ultrapure water milli q was obtained from milli q plus millipore billerica ma usa total organic carbon toc was measured with a toc 300 v analyzer mitsubishi chemical analytech kanagawa japan sodium nitrite nano2 solution was purchased from wako pure chemical industries 2 3 nmor fp tests 2 3 1 nmor fp of environmental samples by chloramination fpnh2cl the potential for nmor to form by chloramination fpnh2cl in environmental samples was defined as the increase in nmor concentration after 10 days the procedure for the test followed that of other studies mitch et al 2003 with a minor modification yoon et al 2011 a 20 mm stock solution of monochloramine nh2cl was prepared for chloramination unfiltered water samples 900 ml with ph adjusted to 7 0 were dosed with 100 ml of monochloramine stock solution final concentration of 2 0 mm or 142 mg l as cl2 and then the samples were stored in 1 l sealed amber bottles with teflon lined screw caps at 25 c for 10 days shielded from light after 10 days incubation residual chloramine was quenched by adding excess sodium thiosulfate and then the samples were processed for nmor analysis 2 3 2 nmor fp of mor by chloramination fpnh2cl and chlorination fpcl the potential for nmor to form with chloramination of mor fpnh2cl of mor was also defined and tested like the test for environmental samples above with a minor modification mor was added to the solutions dosed with the monochloramine stock solution to the initial mor concentrations of 0 57 μm equal to 50 μg l or 1 15 μm equal to 100 μg l and initial chloramine concentration of 2 0 mm or 142 mg l as cl2 aliquots of 1 l ultrapure water without mor only chloramine and without chloramine only mor were also processed using the same procedure to serve as controls to evaluate the actual disinfection conditions operating in stp b table s2 nmor fpcl chlorination 1 0 mg l as cl2 of mor was defined as the increase in nmor concentration after 15 30 and 60 min compared to 0 min at each contact time residual chlorine was quenched by adding excess sodium thiosulfate and then the samples were immediately processed for analysis of formed nmor and residual mor aliquots of 1 l ultrapure water without mor only chlorine and without chlorine only mor were also processed using the same procedure to serve as controls the fp of mor was evaluated from percent molar yield by the following equation 1 m o l a r y i e l d c n m o r c m o r 100 where cnmor is the final molar concentration of nmor and cmor is the initial designed molar concentration of mor 2 3 3 evaluation of nmor formation from mor with nitrite catalyzed by fah nmor formation via fah catalyzed nitrosation was tested mor nitrite and fah stock solution were prepared in ultrapure water to 100 mg l both for nitrite and fah by dilution from standard solutions of nano2 1000 mg l and fah 1000 mg l respectively the effects of mor 1 100 μm nitrite 1 100 μm and fah 1 100 μm concentrations on the formation of nmor from mor were studied in ultrapure water solutions with ph adjusted to 7 0 by 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer the formation of nmor was monitored after 0 25 days equal to 6 h and 1 day for comparison and the nmor concentrations were compared with the individual initial concentrations the effect of ph was studied by incubating ultrapure water with ph adjusted by sodium phosphate buffer ph 3 0 7 0 and 10 0 containing 100 μm mor 100 μm nitrite and 100 μm fah moreover we performed the same test using a 24 h composite sample of influent b 2 of stp b collected on july 11 12 2018 to confirm the effect of the matrix on different initial concentrations 1 100 μm of mor all reactions were maintained in sealed amber bottles with teflon lined screw caps at 25 c shielded from light to control the contact time all samples were pretreated by spe within 1 h of sampling the result was evaluated in molar yield of nmor by equation 1 2 4 biodegradation and photodegradation tests to estimate the attenuation of nmor by bioactivity during river transport biodegradation tests were conducted in accordance with the u s environmental protection agency s test guideline 835 3170 epa 1998b surface water samples were collected at k 2t tributary and k 2m main stream in november 2017 moreover because photolysis is very effective for removal of nmor on summer days with half life t 1 2 of about 17 min sørensen et al 2013 direct photolysis tests were conducted in accordance with the u s environmental protection agency s test guideline 835 2210 epa 1998a to evaluate the natural attenuation of nmor by weak solar irradiation on winter middays december 2018 the methods of these two experiments are described in supplementary information s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and fate of nmor in stp b large variations in nmor concentration are reported not only among different stps during the wastewater treatment processes including primary and secondary treatments krauss and hollender 2008 yoon et al 2013 lee and oh 2016 but also among individual measurements within the same stp krauss et al 2009 despite some parts of the treatment process being the same the occurrence of nmor at the two outlets of stp b b s1 and b s2 was totally different table s7 moreover the results at several points along the two treatment lines of stp b revealed higher concentrations of nmor on the b 2 line than on the b 1 line and a possible increase in nmor occurring during processes along the b 2 line especially the disinfection process which will be further discussed in the following sections based on investigations for each treatment unit along the b 2 line the results implied that nmor and its precursors flow directly into stp b 3 1 1 fluctuation of nmor in influent of stp b because levels of industrial vs domestic input in wastewater can influence the concentrations of nmor in combined wastewater lee and oh 2016 it is likely that influent b 2 includes more discharge from industries involved with mor usage e g dyes rubber and tires fajen et al 1979 kumar and kapur 2016 beita sandí et al 2019 than influent b 1 due to the high fluctuations of nmor table s7 as well as fah influent b 2 was sampled every hour for 24 h in summer july 11 12 2018 and winter december 14 15 2017 mass flux was then calculated based on the concentrations and hourly flow rates in these two surveys nmor showed a clear daily peak in hourly mass flux with hourly mass flux ranging from 0 3 to 5 4 g h in winter fig 2 a and 0 4 3 2 g h in summer fig 2b although some samples could not be collected due to the sampler being blocked by suspended garbage based on results from hourly mass flux it is likely that grab sampling of influent would not accurately capture the fate of nmor in stp b table s7 fah was also detected every hour in winter december 14 15 2017 winter fah showed a clear peak in hourly mass flux range 0 2 5 1 kg h fig s2 although fah could not be analyzed after may 2018 due to a mechanical problem it is likely that fah would be one of the most frequently detected contaminants with 10 μg l in the wastewater all the time table s7 and fig s2 nmor fpnh2cl was not detectable no increase in the concentration of nmor after chloramination either in the influents or in effluents among the 24 h continuous samplings in addition mor was not detected during the 24 h in influent or effluent sampling which might be caused by low concentrations of mor among the samplings the peak of nmor mass flux would imply a specific source of nmor e g industrial or commercial discharge and a regular discharge as is seen with other compounds e g pharmaceuticals and fragrances joss et al 2005 the seasonal pattern of nmor in influent might mainly be caused by flow volumes which could also be one reason for the seasonal pattern in effluent table s7 moreover the higher flow rate in summer might produce the quicker peak time of the nmor mass flux in summer than that in winter 3 1 2 evaluation of nmor formation from mor by fah catalyzed nitrosation as discussed above monitoring at stp b clearly showed the direct flow of nmor into the plant which led us to clarify whether nmor is released directly into the sewers or is formed between the source of nmor precursors and the stp various chemicals especially mor and its derivatives with a morpholine group alkaissi et al 2015 can form nmor kumar and kapur 2016 according to the 2016 japanese pollutant release and transfer register mor was discharged at a rate of 32 6 tonne year and stps received about 10 of that discharge prtr 2016 however mor was not detected in most of the grab samples or the 24 h continuous samplings either in the influent or the effluent of the plant which might be a result of the limitation of mor detection the limit of quantification loq was 0 9 μg l other possibilities include fluctuating levels of mor released from the sources and or the consumption of mor by nitrosation or nitration within the several hours before coming into the stp as has been observed in carbon dioxide capture with excess nitrite and fah in the system dai et al 2012 in other words it is plausible that a large quantity of nmor could be formed in sewerage pipes as a result of fah catalyzed nitrosation before flowing into stps however fluctuating levels of mor were observed among the different sampling events along line 2 of stp b which might reflect fluctuating release from industries or unstable consumption during transport through the sewerage pipes mor was not detected in influent and effluent of the b 2 line on december 14 and 15 2017 whereas it had been detected before and after the disinfection tank on november 7 and 8 2017 discussed in section 3 1 4 we considered that nitrosation of mor to nmor was likely to have occurred in the sewer system because fah table s7 and fig s2 and nitrite table s1 were both detected in the influent of stp b at μg l and sub mg l levels respectively we confirmed that the formation of nmor from mor by nitrosation could be influenced by the initial concentrations of mor fig s4a nitrite fig s4b and fah fig s4c in ultrapure water moreover acidic conditions ph 3 0 facilitated the formation of nmor fig s4d in ultrapure water although the ph of influent b 2 was nearly neutral table s1 therefore to test our hypothesis nmor formation from mor in three different matrices ultrapure water only influent only ultrapure water with 100 μm nitrite and 100 μm fah was tested with the same initial concentrations of mor 1 10 and 100 μm and at constant ph 7 0 and temperature 25 c for 0 25 and 1 days the formation of nmor in influent of stp b line b 2 was less than that in the ultrapure water plus 100 μm fah and 100 μm nitrite at 0 25 days fig 3 a which was caused by the difference in levels of fah and nitrite in the influent of line b 2 both fah concentration ranging from 10 to 300 μg l equal to 0 3 10 μm table s7 and nitrite with maximum value of 0 1 mg l equal to 2 2 μm table s1 were much lower than 100 μm however by 1 day the level of nmor formation in the influent group with 100 μm mor was the same as that in the ultrapure water plus nitrite and fah group fig 3b indicating that the b 2 influent had different conditions for nmor formation because raw sewage generally has a more complicated matrix there is likely to be other catalysts e g acetaldehyde and other nitrosation agents e g n2o3 and n2o4 helping to increase the nmor formation as the time increases dai et al 2012 chandan et al 2013 nitrite was identified as one key factor contributing to the nmor formation as well as mor because different performance was confirmed in other influents collected from three different plants outside of the research area before and after the addition of nitrite fig s5 however more studies are needed in the future to further investigate the conditions in sewerage pipelines that influence the mechanisms of nmor formation and to locate the point sources of mor nmor discharge from factories 3 1 3 occurrence and fate of nmor in biological treatment at stp b although we found that nmor levels in the influent samples fluctuated it was still interesting that the nmor concentrations were higher in grab samples of effluent than in the influent table s7 both in the b 1 line and the b 2 line in stp b during the 24 h continuous samplings of influent in july 2017 corresponding sampling for final effluent was conducted for the b 2 line taking retention time into consideration the results showed that the unstable inputs of nmor fig 2b might become blended within the subsequent treatment units in the plant fig s3 leading to a more stable mass flux of nmor in the effluent although degradation or formation of nmor might also happen during the treatment therefore we investigated the fate of nmor in each of the main treatment units biological treatment and disinfection process by sampling every hour for 24 h among the eight nitrosamines that have been studied the removal rates during biotreatment are the lowest for nmor krauss et al 2009 gerrity et al 2015 one possible reason is that nmor possesses within its structure the weak electron donating functional group morpholine wijekoon et al 2013 krauss et al also reported that the removal efficiency of nmor varied significantly between stps as well as within the same stp over time and that a cas system with a nitrification step was beneficial for nmor removal krauss et al 2009 although nmor generally shows poor removal the reasons for the fluctuating removal levels were still not clear to understand the effect of biological treatment on nmor removal in stp b two auto samplers were set one before and one after biological treatment using recycled nitrification and a step feed biological nitrogen removal process line 8 on the b 2 line table s2 and samples were collected every hour for 24 h the concentration of nmor was 31 8 65 8 ng l in the influent fig 4 a and 38 5 84 0 ng l in the effluent fig 4b of the aeration tank indicating either formation of nmor or no change during nitrification rather than removal since there is a certain threshold concentration of enzymes necessary for nmor transformation bosma et al 1997 and limited biodegradation by biological filters glover et al 2019 the nitrification process line 8 was not sufficient to decompose nmor the nmor concentration in the influent to the biological treatment unit fig 4a could be affected by the peak in the hourly mass flux of nmor in the influent line to the plant fig 2 the increase in the concentration in the effluent from the biological treatment unit might be due to continuous or intermittent additional input of nmor via return sludge a follow up survey was conducted for activated sludge and return sludge collected as grab samples from all lines of the b 2 line in all lines the concentrations of nmor in the aqueous phase of the sludges were similar table s8 considering the high hydrophilicity of nmor these results would imply that nmor was circulated in the aeration tank and that the tank stabilizes the fluctuations of nmor concentration that were observed in the influent in contrast fah was detected with a range of 8 8 73 5 μg l in the influent to the aeration tank but was not detected after biotreatment 1 0 μg l fig s6 the result clearly showed the much higher biodegradability of fah than nmor as reported in both aerobic eiroa et al 2005 and anaerobic systems garrido et al 2001 3 1 4 occurrence and fate of nmor in disinfection tanks of stp b in general there is almost no nmor fp by the oxidants used as disinfectants e g ozonation chlorine or chloramine in secondary effluent stp discharge or surface waters krauss et al 2010 shah et al 2012 woods et al 2015 nmor was observed before the disinfection tank fig 5a1 with no significant change during the disinfection process fig 5a2 by multiplying the concentration of nmor observed in five grab samplings 2 times in winter and 3 times in summer by the flow rate at each sampling time table s9 and considering the retention time of disinfection average value of 0 5 h we calculated the values of nmor that we expected to see at point 5 immediately downstream from the confluence of effluent from all disinfection tanks on the b 2 line fig s7 the values of nmor observed at point 5 were only slightly higher 0 6 13 8 than the predicted values fig s8 because there was little or no formation during the disinfection process in this study this implies that nmor was mainly present as a daily micropollutant from wastewaters resulting from human activities krauss et al 2009 rather than a dbp the low transformation rate from mor to nmor even under excess chloramination and moderate chlorination figs s9 and s10 might explain why there is little or no formation of nmor during the actual disinfection process in stp b 3 2 occurrence and distribution of nmor in surface waters of the yodo river basin levels of nmor detected by monitoring in the yodo river basin between may 2017 and october 2018 are presented in fig 6 details in table s10 the highest concentration of nmor detected in stp discharges based on the median values was observed at b s2 with 62 1 ng l detected 20 times out of 20 sampling events followed by 16 1 ng l at c s 10 10 13 4 ng l at d s 10 10 4 0 ng l at b s1 12 12 and 1 6 ng l at a s 9 10 it should be noted that although the highest concentrations of nmor 26 4 171 ng l table s10 with 100 detection frequency were found at b s2 the outlet of stp b to the katsura river this was not the case at the other outlet of stp b b s1 discussed above for b s2 a higher mean value was observed in winter 112 45 0 ng l n 6 than in summer 51 3 16 9 ng l n 10 which was coincident with the seasonal pattern in influent b 2 fig 2 this seasonal pattern was observed at c s too at most river sampling points the median concentration of nmor was below 10 ng l which might be due to dilution or attenuation by sunlight sørensen et al 2013 at the midstream point k 2m nmor ranged from 0 9 to 32 2 ng l nmor was still detected at the most downstream site y m in this study which was close to the uptake point for a drinking water treatment plant nmor at y m ranged from 0 7 to 4 8 ng l with 67 detection frequency nmor fpnh2cl was not detectable either in the river water or in wastewater effluents in any of the surveys table s10 which might be because of low levels of precursors for example mor was detected at 3 8 μg l at b s2 data not shown but was not detected in surface waters in a previous study kodamatani et al 2017 up to 0 8 μg l of mor was detected in treated wastewater but there was also no detection in river water or sea water 3 3 fate of nmor in the yodo river basin and results of batch tests on attenuation of nmor seasonal and diurnal differences in the nmor concentrations in river samples could be affected by flow rate removal efficiency environmental fate and patterns of discharge of nmor into within and from stps to estimate the natural attenuation and contribution of nmor in main streams influenced by stps the mass balance of nmor in the study area was calculated based on mass flux at each site by multiplying the detected concentration by the mean river flow rate per day or the mean stp discharge in terms of cubic meters of effluent per day because sampling was carried out during periods of no rainfall the flow rate at k 2t was the sum of those at a s and b s1 flow rates at each stp were obtained from the local government the flow rates are summarized in table s11 the system boundary of the region from the upstream was set at two reference points including the middle k 2m and the most downstream site y m k 4t and y t each had small flow volume with low frequency and low concentration of nmor and were ignored in the mass balance calculations as a result b s2 discharged from stp b was the major source of nmor in the study area showing seasonal patterns of higher mass flux of nmor in winter 41 4 16 1 g d n 6 than in summer 24 8 7 3 g d n 9 table s12 to protect downstream water quality it is necessary to determine the factors that affect the mass flow of nmor at each site by examining the differences between summer daytime sd summer night sn winter daytime wd and winter night wn measurements mass flux of nmor discharged from stp b b s2 showed higher diurnal values in the daytime than that at night fig 7 as shown in fig 7 seasonal and diurnal patterns of attenuation of nmor were observed during the river transport by comparison of mass flux between b s2 and two downstream reference points k 2m and y m nmor remained at k 2m and y m at night sn and wn with lower or no attenuation compared with that in the daytime day sd and wd indicating that solar intensity could be an important factor for degradation of nmor on the other hand higher attenuation of nmor happened in sd than in wd which might be caused by the greatly different uv intensity between summer and winter hanamoto et al 2013 direct photolysis experiments showed nmor to be photodegradable with a half life t 1 2 of 47 3 min for the irradiation conditions of midday sunlight in ultrapure water in winter fig s11a the value of t 1 2 was much greater about 3 fold than that in summer midday sørensen et al 2013 in contrast no biodegradation of nmor was found in the environmental samples fig s12 therefore from the viewpoint of the conservation of water quality at drinking water sources more attention needs to be paid to periods in which uv is weak such as at night or when conditions are bad for photolysis e g cloudy high levels of dom and suspended solids increased water depth in winter on the other hand mor was not degraded by photoirradiation under the same conditions fig s11b moreover mor was formed from the photolysis of nmor with a formation of about 0 28 μg mor μg nmor during 60 min fig s11a this indicates that even though nmor is photodegradable there is still a risk of pollution from the precursor mor and nmor in downstream waters 4 conclusions the chemical mor is the primary precursor involved in the unintentional formation of the possibly carcinogenic compound nmor which is difficult to remove during conventional wastewater treatment processes in this study nmor mainly came from the area serviced by stp b which implies that nmor is a contaminant with an industrial source in the study area the removal of nmor during the treatment processes at this stp was very low or none the present research clearly exhibited the possibility that unintentional nitrosation of mor via fah catalyzed nitrosation of mor by nitrite to form nmor could occur inside of industries that use mor or during transportation in sewerage pipelines the nmor detected here did not appear to be a dbp per se under conditions of low chlorine disinfection around 1 0 mg l although mor was detected in secondary effluent at levels of a few tens of micrograms per liter the frequency of detection of nmor was high in the yodo river basin especially in the effluent of the stps studied 80 the highest nmor level was found in effluent from stp b 26 4 171 ng l combined with results about mass balance of nmor low nmor removal was found in surface waters during periods of low uv intensity especially in winter when there was a higher mass load of nmor discharge sharing of information between industries discharging industrial effluent that might contain mor or nmor sewerage system operators and water suppliers is important for the protection of safe drinking water at downstream sites furthermore the social responsibility of source control of mor at industries that use the substance is probably needed more than end of pipe control by upgrading stps acknowledgments we acknowledge the long range research initiative of the japan chemical industry association jcia pt04 01 and the environment

18599,over the years industrial activities that generate high salinity effluents have been intensifying this has relevant potential for causing organic and microbiological pollution which damages both human and ocean health the development of new regulations such as ballast water convention encourage the development of treatment systems that can be feasible for treating seawater effluents accordingly an approach based on the uv activation of persulfate salts has been assessed in this scenario two different persulfate sources s2o8 2 and hso5 were evaluated under uv c irradiation for disinfection purposes an optimization process was performed with low chemical doses 1 mm in order to extensively examine the applicability on seawater different water matrices were tested as well as different microorganisms including both fecal and marine bacteria an enhancement of uv inactivation with the addition of persulfate salts was achieved in all cases kinetic rate constant has been accelerated by up to 79 in seawater it implies a uv dose saving up to 45 to achieve 4 log reductions best efficiencies were obtained with hso5 0 005 mm and s2o8 2 0 5 mm higher effectiveness was obtained with the use of hso5 due to its low stability and interaction with chloride also different responses were obtained according to the specific microorganisms by achieving faster disinfection in gram negative than in gram positive bacteria the sensitivity observed was vibrio spp e coli e faecalis marine heterotrophic bacteria with an evaluation of regrowth after treatment greater cell damage was detected with the addition of persulfate salts the major ability of regrowth for marine bacteria encourages the use of a residual disinfectant after disinfection processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords seawater disinfection advanced oxidation processes sulfate radicals naturally occurring bacteria uv inactivation regrowth 1 introduction in recent years different human induced pressures have significantly degraded the marine environment recently emerging sources of pollution related to maritime transport and industrial activities have increased the risk of contamination of the world s oceans for instance the uncontrolled discharge of ballast water has caused substantial threats in marine ecosystems by causing ecological economical and human health related impacts it has led to the implementation of a specific ballast water regulation including a unique international maritime organization imo convention that was entered into force in 2017 imo 2004 additionally other activities such as aquaculture burridge et al 2010 oilfield operations yang et al 2014 or reverse osmosis brines grebel 2010 lead to the generation of high salinity effluents with great potential for causing organic and microbiological pollution these are capable of subsequently having enormous impacts on the recipient ecosystems accordingly it is necessary to implement and develop treatment systems that can be efficient in marine effluents available treatment methods for seawater have previously been used for the treatment of drinking water and wastewater and have been customized to the treatment of marine waters such as ballast water in this context uv inactivation and electro chlorination disinfection methods are the treatment systems that are generally implemented hess erga et al 2019 however although these treatments are considered to be effective several shortcomings can be ascertained with this application in seawater for instance chlorination involves the generation of undesirable by products due to the high concentrations of chloride and bromide in seawater that can be toxic and cause noteworthy environmental risks david et al 2018 moreno andrés and peperzak 2019 on the other hand uv radiation involves the regrowth of microorganisms due to the lack of a residual effect and repair mechanism of microorganisms grob and pollet 2016 hess erga et al 2019 a combination of several treatment methods with different properties has been recently studied for example uv based systems have been developed to promote either photochemically or photocatalytically radical species with high oxidation rates that are able to produce greater cell damage in different types of microorganisms moreno andrés et al 2018a yang et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 persulfate salts usually applied in the form of sodium peroxydisulfate salt pds or triple potassium peroxymonosulfate salt pms are currently being studied and are demonstrating promising results for water treatment ghanbari and moradi 2017 ike et al 2018 wacławek et al 2017 the activation of persulfates involves the generation of sulfate radicals that are more selective and stable so4 2 with a longer half life compared to the well known hydroxyl radical oh ghanbari and moradi 2017 wacławek et al 2017 the high stability and reactivity of persulfates is also an advantage for in situ chemical oxidation isco applications ike et al 2018 wacławek et al 2017 additionally its commercial acquisition as a powder makes the persulfates easy to store handle and transport persulfates salts can be activated through the homolysis of peroxide bond which can be performed in several ways such as by thermolysis or photolysis ike et al 2018 wacławek et al 2017 ike et al 2018 revealed that persulfate is more photoactive λ 254 nm than other oxidants such as h2o2 also uv activated persulfate can be a cost effective alternative in those systems in which uv is already a part of the treatment process such as those that occur in the majority of aquaculture and ballast water treatment systems the activation of the persulfates incites an increase in the levels of residual so4 2 an aspect that may be disadvantageous in freshwater wang and wang 2018 although it can result innocuous in marine waters because sulfate anion is one of the major ions that is naturally present in seawater ahn et al 2013 thus the addition of sulfate ion from a treatment system could not be considered environmentally relevant several studies have shown the effectiveness of a uv persulfate system in different water matrices that primarily focused on the degradation of pollutants antoniou et al 2010 nihemaiti et al 2018 serna galvis et al 2017 wang and wang 2018 and to a lesser extent using it for disinfection purposes anipsitakis et al 2008 bianco et al 2017 michael kordatou et al 2015 rodríguez chueca et al 2018 2017a serna galvis et al 2018 wen et al 2017 however the studies that focused on high salinity waters for pollutants degradation yang et al 2014 and inactivation of microorganisms wang et al 2016 are significantly less additionally other persulfate systems that do not use uv have been positively tested in phytoplankton species ahn et al 2013 fungi wen et al 2019 or bacteria ciulli et al 2017 accordingly there is a potential application of a persulfate system in different water bodies nevertheless literature lacks of disinfection studies in high salinity waters thus the main goal of this study is to investigate the disinfection efficacy of a uv persulfate system in seawater it has been evaluated in depth with both pds and pms salts in three different water matrices and compared to the well known uv c process the different systems have been assessed with the common bacterial indicator enterococcus faecalis and briefly evaluated with different specific marine microorganisms novelty aspects such the use of a low reagents dose 1 mm the use of real seawater and naturally occurring microorganisms can provide a wide ranging idea of the viability of this process in marine water applications 2 material and methods 2 1 tested water different water matrices were employed for inactivation assays i phosphate buffered milli ro water dw ii artificial saltwater by adding 30 g of nacl 99 scharlau per liter to milli ro water asw and iii natural seawater that was collected by sampling at the port of cádiz spain 36 32 11 075 n 6 17 6 04 w sw physical chemical characterization of the different water matrices was performed table 1 by determining ph and conductivity crison multimeter mm 41 uv254 transmittance jenway 7315 spectrophotometer the shimadzu toc l analyzer in non purgeable organic carbon npoc mode was utilized for measuring the total organic carbon toc concentration in seawater the concentration of different ions in the tested water was analyzed with ion chromatography with detection by conductivity metrohm 881 compact ic pro with asupp5 250 4 0 column anions 882 compact ic plus with c4 250 4 0 column cations 2 2 target microorganisms different bacteria were assessed as target microorganisms firstly an optimization process was performed with enterococcus faecalis as a microbiological indicator atcc 19433 cect 481 e faecalis have previously been suggested to be a good indicator for assessing different disinfection treatments due to their resistance to uv based treatments bianco et al 2017 moreno andrés et al 2017 romero martínez et al 2014 additionally it has also been established as an indicator in international regulations such as the ballast water management convention hess erga et al 2019 imo 2004 secondly the viability of the different photochemical processes was assessed with a typical escherichia coli indicator atcc 8739 with the naturally occurring marine bacteria vibrio spp and with the community of marine heterotrophic bacteria mhb pure strains e faecalis and e coli were preserved in cryo vials with glycerol at 50 35 c bacterial pre cultures were obtained by culturing in brain and heart infusion broth scharlab for e faecalis and tryptic soy broth scharlab medium for e coli after 24 h of incubation at 37 c 1 ml from the suspension was sub cultured again in order to obtain an inoculum ready for experimentation microbial suspensions were harvested as described in the bibliography e g marjanovic et al 2018 moreno andrés et al 2016 and the initial inoculum was then diluted in a water matrix for experimentation while assuring a minimum concentration of 106 colony forming unit cfu ml 1 wild bacteria were also used for the inactivation assays vibrio spp and mhb to obtain relatively high concentrations and secure a proper statistical analysis yeast extract was added to the test water sw as a substrate for marine bacteria moreno andrés et al 2018b all assays began 48 h after water sampling in order to assure a concentration of 106 cfu ml 1 for each bacterial group the evolution and survival of microorganisms after treatment was monitored with standard plate counts in slanetz bartley agar ttc 1 panreac for e faecalis chromogenic collinstant agar scharlab for e coli thiosulfate citrate bile salts sucrose agar pronadisa condalab for vibrio spp and marine agar scharlab for mhb plates were incubated for 24 72 h at 30 c vibrio spp and mhb or 37 c e faecalis and e coli according to the specific microorganism in order to ensure a measurable number of cfus ideally 15 150 cfu tenfold dilutions from each sample were plated in triplicate 2 3 experimental set up experimentation was conducted in batch mode at room temperature two different persulfate salts were used sodium peroxydisulfate pds na2s2o8 98 panreac applichem and potassium peroxymonosulfate pms khso5 0 5khso4 0 5k2so4 oxone sigma aldrich firstly preliminary dark tests were performed to determine whether the application of pds and pms reagents in the tested water matrices are capable of inactivating bacteria without the intervention of uv radiation once the three water matrices were prepared according to section 2 1 different doses of persulfate salts 0 005 1 mm were applied in the absence of uv irradiation the bacterial inactivation was evaluated comparing the samples taken at the beginning of the reaction time 0 at 30 min and at 60 min secondly photochemical tests were performed by using a collimated beam reactor equipped with a low pressure uv c lamp wedeco 10 w as a source of light a complete description of the photo reactor including the uv dose measurements have been clearly specified in the supplementary material text s 1 fig s1 the experimental set up has been defined according to previous studies moreno andrés et al 2019 2016 briefly the experiments were arranged by exposing 20 ml samples of water spiked with different microorganisms to the collimated beam reactor each sample was held in a borosilicate petri dish and underwent uv radiation under regular exposure times which implies different uv doses ranging from zero to approximately 60 mj cm 2 persulfate salts were added in a single dosage before uv radiation three experimental treatments were defined in this study i exposure to uv radiation uv ii uv radiation sodium peroxydisulfate uv pds and iii uv radiation potassium peroxymonosulfate uv pms applied to the three selected water matrices section 2 1 with different types of bacteria section 2 2 the efficacy of the inactivation of each system was assessed according to three experimental phases i optimization of the dose of persulfate salts in order to determine the most efficient reagent concentration several concentrations of pds 0 05 0 2 0 5 1 mm and pms 0 005 0 05 0 2 mm were tested these tests were performed with dw and e faecalis as bacterial indicator ii water matrix with results obtained from the optimization phase it is necessary to apply these concentrations in water matrices that are more complex in order to simulate the reality in saline waters thus three different water matrices dw asw sw were assessed with e faecalis as the bacterial indicator iii ultimately the three different treatments uv uv pds uv pms were validated in real seawater by focusing on the effects on different bacteria e coli vibrio spp and mhb in order to obtain a complete scenario of the disinfection process the regrowth of bacteria was monitored in the last step after inactivation assays water samples were stored in sterile containers in darkness at ambient temperature during 48 h and were subsequently microbiologically analyzed 2 4 data analysis microbial inactivation was assessed with dose response curves mean bacterial counts were represented as the logarithmic reduction of the survival microorganisms log n n0 according to the initial concentration of microorganisms 105 106 cfu ml 1 the detection limit was defined as 4 69 5 70 decimal log reductions modeling of inactivation kinetics was performed according to the log lineal tail model which is most appropriate for discontinuous reactors moreno andrés et al 2017 this model is primarily based on the maximum inactivation rate constant assuming that there will be no more inactivation in the tailing phase due to resistance mechanisms the traditional equation eq 1 of first order inactivation kinetics plus the added tail parameter is based on the bacterial concentration at a certain uv dose nd cfu ml 1 which is a function that depends on the initial concentration of microorganisms n0 cfu ml 1 the residual cell concentration or tail starting point nres cfu ml 1 the dose of exposure uv dose mj cm 2 and the specific inactivation rate constant kmax cm2 mj 1 the ginafit software was used to fit the inactivation results on the kinetic model and it was validated by using both the coefficient of determination r2 0 91 and the root mean square deviation rmse was in the range of 0 27 0 39 1 n d n 0 n r e s e k max uv dose n r e s persulfate concentration was monitored spectrophotometrically at the beginning and at the end of each assay at 512 nm for pds and at 395 nm for pms according to the protocols proposed by liang et al 2008 and wacławek et al 2015 also the colorimetric dpd method was used as a complementary analytical method for determining oxidant species it is accepted for water analysis by standard protocols and recommended for seawater buchan et al 2005 the evolution of sulfates was also monitored by ion chromatography see section 2 1 this measurement determines whether there are changes in water quality due to increases in sulfate which is a potential product of photochemical activation of persulfates for bacterial regrowth analysis the percentage of dark regrowth was calculated according to lindenauer and darby 1994 the percentage of bacterial regrowth was calculated according to eq 2 by taking into account the concentration of viable bacteria of the reactivated sample nr cfu ml 1 and the concentration of viable bacteria before n0 cfu ml 1 and after disinfection treatment n cfu ml 1 2 r e g r o w t h n r n n 0 n 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of pds and pms without activation preliminary tests were performed in order to estimate operational conditions together with an assessment of the disinfection efficiency of different persulfate salts i e without activation by light it was carried out in dw with e faecalis as the target organism the range tested was 0 005 1 mm for both pds and pms the results are represented in fig 1 according to the results that were obtained it can be seen that only minor inactivation rates are obtained at different concentrations that are tested this slight inactivation can be due to the oxidation potential of both pds 2 01 v and pms 1 8 v ghanbari and moradi 2017 wacławek et al 2017 but also due to the stability of different salts it is known that pms is less stable than pds wen et al 2019 it is also worth mentioning that with the tests that were performed with a dose of 1 mm of pms the oxidation process seriously affected the population of e faecalis data not shown therefore that can result in major inactivation rates at higher concentrations as it has been reported previously rodríguez chueca et al 2018 2017b nonetheless within the range of concentrations tested in fig 1 persulfate salts never reach a log reduction within the 60 min of reaction this is in accordance with previous studies in which it is reported that such a concentration of persulfates does not influence the viability of this type of bacteria bianco et al 2017 rodríguez chueca et al 2017a nor with other types of organisms such as some phytoplankton species ahn et al 2013 thus it is assured that the effects reported in the next sections resulting from the effect produced by the combination of uv radiation and pds or pms 3 2 optimization process based on pds pms dose as a first step different concentrations of pds and pms were tested in the simplest distilled water matrix dw fig 2 an improvement of uv disinfection is obtained in all cases thus the detection limit is reached more rapidly as the chemical concentration increases concentrations of 0 5 mm pds and 0 05 mm pms were the most effective in dw it suggests a major bactericidal effect for the uv pms system other authors described similar results and report the largest efficiencies for pms compared to pds rodríguez chueca et al 2019 2018 for quantitative assessment of the inactivation kinetic modeling was performed with a non linear adjustment of experimental points eq 1 the kinetic parameters that were obtained are presented in table 2 it can also be visually seen in the inner box of fig 2 kinetic rate constants are in the range of previous studies e g moreno andrés et al 2019 reported a kmax value of 0 65 0 10 cm2 mj 1 for pds at 1 mm similar studies with the same bacterial strain also report comparable results koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005 therefore the improvement from adding persulfates increased the efficacy by up to 109 for 0 5 mm of pds and 0 05 mm of pms based on the increase in kmax with respect to the treatment with uv sole in dw the uv dose necessary for reaching a 4 log reduction table 2 d4 shows the same tendency and reports in the best of cases a reduction in the uv dose of 57 for reaching 4 log reductions in the presence of ps salts compared to uv sole another interesting parameter is the residual population density nres which is responsible for the tail phenomenon and can be useful for understanding the disinfection efficiency of the system since the faster nres formation could be associated with a more rapid inactivation activation of persulfates through uv irradiation produced the homolysis of peroxide bond and generates so4 pds and both so4 and oh pms with a quantum yield at λ 254 nm of ϕpds 1 4 mol e 1 and ϕpms 0 52 mol e 1 respectively wacławek et al 2017 wang and wang 2018 in the case of pms it is important to mention the generation of sulfur pentoxide radical so5 which is produced by the reaction of so4 with hso5 eq 3 so5 has lower oxidation potential 1 1 v but can inflict important damage for bacteria as recently reported by rodríguez chueca et al 2019 3 so 4 h s o 5 so 5 h s o 4 this activation method implies a higher disinfection efficiency as shown in the results and as similarly reported by other studies michael kordatou et al 2015 rodríguez chueca et al 2019 2018 serna galvis et al 2018 wang et al 2016 as observed in fig 2 and table 2 it is worth mentioning that a higher concentration of persulfate salts does not always result in higher inactivation rates in this sense it is expected that recombination and parasitic reactions dominate the system and decrease in efficiency amasha et al 2018 when that happens it suggests that a critical inhibition level is reached for persulfate activation michael kordatou et al 2015 these phenomena have been previously reported in disinfection studies e g by rodríguez chueca et al 2017b who found a decrease in inactivation efficiency b mycoides when the concentration increased from 0 1 to 0 5 mm of pms therefore 0 05 0 005 mm pms and 0 5 mm of pds have been selected as optimal oxidant doses for the next sub sections the production of primary radicals together with the oxidant power of persulfate salts may induce the acceleration of the disinfection at least in dw otherwise other factors such as water dissolved compounds or the membrane cell composition of different organisms can help to clarify inactivation mechanisms of different systems since primary radicals are not always responsible for disinfection sun et al 2016 this will be discussed in the next sub sections 3 3 effect of water matrix the selected doses of pds and pms from the optimization phase section 3 2 were applied in saline water matrices in order to determine the inactivation of bacteria in a real scenario this effect was analyzed from an artificial saltwater matrix with nacl asw followed with real seawater sw the results are presented in fig 3 the individual effect of each persulfate salt on inactivation of e faecalis under dark conditions and at room temperature was analyzed i e without the activation effect by uv radiation fig 3a in the case of pds 0 5 mm a slow decrease in population of up to 0 7 log red was observed after 60 min of reaction on the other hand a higher bactericidal effect was detected with pms thus bacterial population was noticeably damaged during 60 min of reaction in saltwater at a dose of 0 05 mm therefore it was decided to continue using a lower dose of 0 005 mm of pms in which inconsequential inactivation was achieved during dark tests fig 3a those results accord with previous studies in which inactivation rates were higher than 1 log reduction in dark conditions at doses higher than 0 1 mm for pms and 0 5 mm for pds in the case of wastewater rodríguez chueca et al 2018 or saltwater wen et al 2019 the strong effect of pms on bacterial inactivation at concentrations 0 005 mm is probably due to its low stability and interaction with chloride which led to the generation of hclo cl2 species eqs 4 and 5 rivas and solís 2018 recently wen et al 2019 studied this system in depth and reported high inactivation values caused mainly by the formation of chlorine species therefore it is important to take into account the reactivity of persulfates according to the composition of the treated water matrix according to the results obtained in dark tests inactivation assays in uv persulfate systems were performed with 0 5 mm pds and 0 005 mm pms fig 3b and c 4 c l h s o 5 hclo s o 4 2 5 h c l hclo h 2 o c l 2 a uv sole process was used as a control to assess the improvement when pds or pms salts were added into the system it is expected that dissolved ions could act as scattering or absorbing compounds that reduce efficacy chen et al 2016 otherwise slightly higher inactivation rates were obtained in both asw kmaxuv 0 37 0 03 cm2 mj 1 and sw kmaxuv 0 34 0 05 cm2 mj 1 compared to dw kmaxuv 0 31 0 05 cm2 mj 1 thus high salinity could imply stress on e faecalis which might lead to greater sensitivity to the uv treatment hess erga et al 2019 moreno andrés et al 2017 romero martínez et al 2014 for the uv pds system s2o8 2 0 5 mm it can be seen that there is improvement in the disinfection in both water matrices asw kmaxpds 0 46 0 06 cm2 mj 1 sw kmaxpds 0 57 0 08 cm2 mj 1 otherwise the improvement is reduced if it is compared with dw the enhancement on kmax is reduced from 109 in dw till 67 6 in sw fig 4 a for the uv pms system hso5 0 005 mm the inactivation rates observed were asw kmaxpms 0 52 0 08 cm2 mj 1 sw kmaxpms 0 61 0 09 cm2 mj 1 in this case an increase is observed compared to dw the enhancement on kmax rise from 32 2 in dw till 79 4 in sw fig 4a therefore inactivation rates follow the trend of uv pms uv pds uv in both saline waters fig 4 if we evaluate the results with another interesting parameter such as d4 defined as the uv dose necessary for reach 99 99 of inactivation i e the 4 log removal value the same trend can be seen fig 4b the uv dose for reaching a 4 log reduction was smaller for a uv persulfate system than for the single uv system it also suggests a higher disinfection efficiency of pms against pds in high salinity waters those results clearly reflect that there is interference in persulfate systems when salinity increases the improvement on kmax was reduced for uv pds treatment compared to distilled water otherwise best efficiencies based on the increase in kmax were obtained for uv pms in salty waters as compared to dw if it is assumed that in a uv pds system the production rate of so4 as a primary radical is higher than in a uv pms system due to the higher stability of pds and because pms activation implies a generation of both oh and so4 then the scavenging of so4 by dissolved ions will be higher in a uv pds system these phenomena have been deeply studied by sun et al 2016 or yang et al 2014 and could explain the detrimental effects observed in salty waters on inactivation kinetics on the other hand the lower stability of pms together with the higher reaction rates with chlorides to form chlorine species eqs 4 and 5 which can also participate in the inactivation of cells in fact it has been previously reported that this combination pms cl is sufficient to cause the destruction of the cell membrane wen et al 2019 and enhance disinfection rates some interesting trends can also be noticed in the specific water matrix fig 4 the efficiency of uv pms system is enhanced according to sw asw dw otherwise the trend of uv pds is dw sw asw in asw nacl matrix the main dissolved anion is chloride several studies e g nihemaiti et al 2018 yang et al 2014 demonstrate that chloride can act as a radical scavenger and result in different reactive halogen species cl cl2 table s1 that have less oxidant power but are still capable of oxidizing e g organics guan et al 2018 nihemaiti et al 2018 yang et al 2014 and might promote inactivation of bacteria in real sw the appearance of bromide is particularly important due to the strong scavenging rate of both oh and so4 grebel 2010 lu et al 2015 lutze et al 2014 yang et al 2014 as a result the formation of reactive halogen species such as br br2 hbro table s1 can also occur lu et al 2015 lutze et al 2014 yang et al 2014 it is worth noticing that cl oxidation is more favored by so4 than oh yang et al 2014 hence the highest concentration of chlorides and other ions from sw matrix can reduce the efficacy especially in uv pds system as observed in our results according to these assumptions both uv pds and uv pms systems are affected by the specific contents of dissolved inorganic ions in water nonetheless the efficiency of inactivation always increases when persulfate salts are added to the water the effects of this enhancement can be caused by i persulfate itself and related species mainly chlorinated originated by direct reaction with dissolved compounds such as chloride it allows the diffusion of oxidant species in the subsurface before persulfate activation marjanovic et al 2018 wen et al 2019 and ii the activation of persulfates by uv which induces the generation of primary radicals and related halogens radicals that can still inflict cell damage sun et al 2016 yang et al 2014 therefore both diffusion and photo activation processes may be involved in cell inactivation similar results were obtained by bianco et al 2017 and wang et al 2016 who found an improvement in the inactivation of different types of organisms in the presence of chloride 3 4 effect on different organisms the various systems uv uv pds uv pms were also tested with different bacteria two very well established indicators e faecalis and e coli and two groups of typical bacteria from marine waters vibrio spp and marine heterotrophic bacteria mhb disinfection profiles from the different systems are represented in fig 5 the uv c sensitivity of different microorganisms follows the trend vibrio spp e coli e faecalis mhb as expected gram positive organisms such as e faecalis have greater resistance to uv treatments in comparison with gram negative hijnen et al 2006 it can be related to the thickness of the peptidoglycan layer a thinner layer existent in gram negative bacteria implies a better uv propagation through the genetic material santos et al 2013 interestingly a major enhancement was detected in a uv pds system for gram negative bacteria compared to gram positive fig 5 it has been demonstrated that sulfate radicals and related sub species have more affinity with electron rich compounds which suggests their selectivity for reacting with these moieties nihemaiti et al 2018 accordingly and assuming that major so4 can be generated in a uv pds system the electron rich moieties on the bacterial surface can be an easy target of sulfate radicals gram negative bacteria have also major surface bond macromolecules such as proteins or a lipopolysaccharide layer which are extracellular targets for radical species dalrymple et al 2010 wordofa et al 2017 in contrast in a uv pms system there is not a clear trend but slight improvements were detected in e faecalis and mhb fig 5 which suggests that diffusion of oxidative species in solution through the porous peptidoglycan layer may dominate in this system nonetheless according to the sensitivity of different microorganisms results suggest higher sensitivity to both uv and uv persulfate based processes for gram negative bacteria e faecalis and the community of marine heterotrophic bacteria showed similar inactivation rates which recommend that as good model microorganism s for evaluating inactivation efficiency in high salinity waters bianco et al 2017 hess erga et al 2019 moreno andrés et al 2018a romero martínez et al 2014 3 5 residual effect a post treatment scenario was assessed in order to investigate if the possible residual pds or pms salts oxidant can help to avoid the regrowth of bacteria and consequent recolonization of the water bodies which takes significance in the case of marine microorganisms hess erga et al 2019 it could be an advantage in the case of for example ballast tanks in which the water is stored during a journey samples after treatment were saved and analyzed for a pds pms concentration just at the end the experimentation five min of uv c irradiation additional measurements of total residual oxidant in a solution measured as free chlorine and the concentration of microorganisms were determined at regular intervals up to 48 h after treatment the percentage of regrowth of each bacterial group can be seen in table 3 a major regrowth capability is obtained for marine bacteria compared to fecal bacteria besides the cellular damage obtained in different inactivation processes salinity effects can influence this recovery after treatment as an extra factor i e fecal bacteria are affected by salinity which is contrary to specific marine bacteria giannakis et al 2014 moreno andrés et al 2018a moreover it is more pronounced in e coli than in e faecalis byappanahalli et al 2012 oguma et al 2013 as is the trend observed in regrowth results table 3 additionally greater cell damage occurs in the two uv persulfate systems which decrease the regrowth rates in all organisms compared to the uv treatment it can be attributed in addition to the higher cell damage to the residual oxidant that remains in the solution which can easily accumulate in bacterial cells due to the previous damage obtained through inactivation processes in this sense it is worth mentioning that only slight consumption of pds was detected during the experimentation 5 in the case of pms it increased in the range of 15 25 these slight consumption rates were previously reported by e g miralles cuevas et al 2018 the absence of toxic effects from residual persulfate on the health and welfare of marine organisms has also been demonstrated ciulli et al 2017 on the other hand the formation of free chlorine as a product of the oxidation of chlorides by either so4 or hso5 has been already reported anipsitakis et al 2008 rivas and solís 2018 and confirmed in our experiments fig s2 so that can favor diffusion processes inside the cell and avoid regrowth especially on most sensitive bacteria such as vibrio spp furthermore the added sulfates that can be formed as a residual product of uv persulfate systems have been monitored in both dw and sw matrices in sw matrices the background levels of sulfates mask the increase when adding ps salts it was quantified in a 1 8 pds 1 mm and measured after five min of uv c irradiation on the contrary this increment becomes significant in dw which counts for a 62 7 82 4 increase in the level of sulfates after both the uv pds and the uv pms applications these results confirm our hypothesis that the uv persulfate systems are consistent with the chemistry of typical marine waters in which the addition of residual sulfate derived from ps salts is irrelevant due to the relatively high concentration of dissolved inorganic ions especially so4 2 in such water matrices 4 conclusions in this study the enhancement of seawater uv disinfection was investigated with the addition of two different persulfate salts disinfection efficiency has been assessed with several factors such as the dose of persulfates the water matrix and the specific bacteria the addition of persulfate salts is able to promote inactivation of e faecalis in distilled water artificial saltwater nacl and real seawater concentrations below 1 mm are sufficient to increase kinetic rate constants up to 109 in distilled water which involves a reduction in the uv dose of 57 for achieving 4 log reductions in the presence of persulfates compared to uv in high salinity water matrices dissolved inorganic ions affect inactivation processes differently in uv pds than in uv pms systems the lower stability of pms facilitates the interaction with chlorides and enhances the disinfection efficiency in salty waters by up to 79 4 based on the increase in kmax at hso5 0 005 mm on the other hand a uv pds system s2o8 2 0 5 mm is negatively affected in the presence of dissolved ions nonetheless it always improved uv inactivation by testing the uv persulfate systems in different bacteria e coli and vibrio spp were the most sensitive bacteria as compared of e faecalis and the community of marine heterotrophic bacteria by analyzing regrowth in a post treatment scenario the lowest recolonization rates were obtained for uv persulfate systems versus uv treatment suggesting greater damage when using persulfates additionally the total residual oxidant in a solution can be responsible for deterring regrowth in parallel the specific marine bacteria show higher ability to recover in a post treatment scenario against fecal bacteria suggesting the use of specific marine microorganisms when evaluating disinfection systems related to marine waters conflicts of interest there are no conflicts of interest to declare acknowledgments this research has been developed under the r d project avante ctm2014 52116 r funded by the spanish ministry

18599,over the years industrial activities that generate high salinity effluents have been intensifying this has relevant potential for causing organic and microbiological pollution which damages both human and ocean health the development of new regulations such as ballast water convention encourage the development of treatment systems that can be feasible for treating seawater effluents accordingly an approach based on the uv activation of persulfate salts has been assessed in this scenario two different persulfate sources s2o8 2 and hso5 were evaluated under uv c irradiation for disinfection purposes an optimization process was performed with low chemical doses 1 mm in order to extensively examine the applicability on seawater different water matrices were tested as well as different microorganisms including both fecal and marine bacteria an enhancement of uv inactivation with the addition of persulfate salts was achieved in all cases kinetic rate constant has been accelerated by up to 79 in seawater it implies a uv dose saving up to 45 to achieve 4 log reductions best efficiencies were obtained with hso5 0 005 mm and s2o8 2 0 5 mm higher effectiveness was obtained with the use of hso5 due to its low stability and interaction with chloride also different responses were obtained according to the specific microorganisms by achieving faster disinfection in gram negative than in gram positive bacteria the sensitivity observed was vibrio spp e coli e faecalis marine heterotrophic bacteria with an evaluation of regrowth after treatment greater cell damage was detected with the addition of persulfate salts the major ability of regrowth for marine bacteria encourages the use of a residual disinfectant after disinfection processes graphical abstract image

have significantly degraded the marine environment recently emerging sources of pollution related to maritime transport and industrial activities have increased the risk of contamination of the world s oceans for instance the uncontrolled discharge of ballast water has caused substantial threats in marine ecosystems by causing ecological economical and human health related impacts it has led to the implementation of a specific ballast water regulation including a unique international maritime organization imo convention that was entered into force in 2017 imo 2004 additionally other activities such as aquaculture burridge et al 2010 oilfield operations yang et al 2014 or reverse osmosis brines grebel 2010 lead to the generation of high salinity effluents with great potential for causing organic and microbiological pollution these are capable of subsequently having enormous impacts on the recipient ecosystems accordingly it is necessary to implement and develop treatment systems that can be efficient in marine effluents available treatment methods for seawater have previously been used for the treatment of drinking water and wastewater and have been customized to the treatment of marine waters such as ballast water in this context uv inactivation and electro chlorination disinfection methods are the treatment systems that are generally implemented hess erga et al 2019 however although these treatments are considered to be effective several shortcomings can be ascertained with this application in seawater for instance chlorination involves the generation of undesirable by products due to the high concentrations of chloride and bromide in seawater that can be toxic and cause noteworthy environmental risks david et al 2018 moreno andrés and peperzak 2019 on the other hand uv radiation involves the regrowth of microorganisms due to the lack of a residual effect and repair mechanism of microorganisms grob and pollet 2016 hess erga et al 2019 a combination of several treatment methods with different properties has been recently studied for example uv based systems have been developed to promote either photochemically or photocatalytically radical species with high oxidation rates that are able to produce greater cell damage in different types of microorganisms moreno andrés et al 2018a yang et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 persulfate salts usually applied in the form of sodium peroxydisulfate salt pds or triple potassium peroxymonosulfate salt pms are currently being studied and are demonstrating promising results for water treatment ghanbari and moradi 2017 ike et al 2018 wacławek et al 2017 the activation of persulfates involves the generation of sulfate radicals that are more selective and stable so4 2 with a longer half life compared to the well known hydroxyl radical oh ghanbari and moradi 2017 wacławek et al 2017 the high stability and reactivity of persulfates is also an advantage for in situ chemical oxidation isco applications ike et al 2018 wacławek et al 2017 additionally its commercial acquisition as a powder makes the persulfates easy to store handle and transport persulfates salts can be activated through the homolysis of peroxide bond which can be performed in several ways such as by thermolysis or photolysis ike et al 2018 wacławek et al 2017 ike et al 2018 revealed that persulfate is more photoactive λ 254 nm than other oxidants such as h2o2 also uv activated persulfate can be a cost effective alternative in those systems in which uv is already a part of the treatment process such as those that occur in the majority of aquaculture and ballast water treatment systems the activation of the persulfates incites an increase in the levels of residual so4 2 an aspect that may be disadvantageous in freshwater wang and wang 2018 although it can result innocuous in marine waters because sulfate anion is one of the major ions that is naturally present in seawater ahn et al 2013 thus the addition of sulfate ion from a treatment system could not be considered environmentally relevant several studies have shown the effectiveness of a uv persulfate system in different water matrices that primarily focused on the degradation of pollutants antoniou et al 2010 nihemaiti et al 2018 serna galvis et al 2017 wang and wang 2018 and to a lesser extent using it for disinfection purposes anipsitakis et al 2008 bianco et al 2017 michael kordatou et al 2015 rodríguez chueca et al 2018 2017a serna galvis et al 2018 wen et al 2017 however the studies that focused on high salinity waters for pollutants degradation yang et al 2014 and inactivation of microorganisms wang et al 2016 are significantly less additionally other persulfate systems that do not use uv have been positively tested in phytoplankton species ahn et al 2013 fungi wen et al 2019 or bacteria ciulli et al 2017 accordingly there is a potential application of a persulfate system in different water bodies nevertheless literature lacks of disinfection studies in high salinity waters thus the main goal of this study is to investigate the disinfection efficacy of a uv persulfate system in seawater it has been evaluated in depth with both pds and pms salts in three different water matrices and compared to the well known uv c process the different systems have been assessed with the common bacterial indicator enterococcus faecalis and briefly evaluated with different specific marine microorganisms novelty aspects such the use of a low reagents dose 1 mm the use of real seawater and naturally occurring microorganisms can provide a wide ranging idea of the viability of this process in marine water applications 2 material and methods 2 1 tested water different water matrices were employed for inactivation assays i phosphate buffered milli ro water dw ii artificial saltwater by adding 30 g of nacl 99 scharlau per liter to milli ro water asw and iii natural seawater that was collected by sampling at the port of cádiz spain 36 32 11 075 n 6 17 6 04 w sw physical chemical characterization of the different water matrices was performed table 1 by determining ph and conductivity crison multimeter mm 41 uv254 transmittance jenway 7315 spectrophotometer the shimadzu toc l analyzer in non purgeable organic carbon npoc mode was utilized for measuring the total organic carbon toc concentration in seawater the concentration of different ions in the tested water was analyzed with ion chromatography with detection by conductivity metrohm 881 compact ic pro with asupp5 250 4 0 column anions 882 compact ic plus with c4 250 4 0 column cations 2 2 target microorganisms different bacteria were assessed as target microorganisms firstly an optimization process was performed with enterococcus faecalis as a microbiological indicator atcc 19433 cect 481 e faecalis have previously been suggested to be a good indicator for assessing different disinfection treatments due to their resistance to uv based treatments bianco et al 2017 moreno andrés et al 2017 romero martínez et al 2014 additionally it has also been established as an indicator in international regulations such as the ballast water management convention hess erga et al 2019 imo 2004 secondly the viability of the different photochemical processes was assessed with a typical escherichia coli indicator atcc 8739 with the naturally occurring marine bacteria vibrio spp and with the community of marine heterotrophic bacteria mhb pure strains e faecalis and e coli were preserved in cryo vials with glycerol at 50 35 c bacterial pre cultures were obtained by culturing in brain and heart infusion broth scharlab for e faecalis and tryptic soy broth scharlab medium for e coli after 24 h of incubation at 37 c 1 ml from the suspension was sub cultured again in order to obtain an inoculum ready for experimentation microbial suspensions were harvested as described in the bibliography e g marjanovic et al 2018 moreno andrés et al 2016 and the initial inoculum was then diluted in a water matrix for experimentation while assuring a minimum concentration of 106 colony forming unit cfu ml 1 wild bacteria were also used for the inactivation assays vibrio spp and mhb to obtain relatively high concentrations and secure a proper statistical analysis yeast extract was added to the test water sw as a substrate for marine bacteria moreno andrés et al 2018b all assays began 48 h after water sampling in order to assure a concentration of 106 cfu ml 1 for each bacterial group the evolution and survival of microorganisms after treatment was monitored with standard plate counts in slanetz bartley agar ttc 1 panreac for e faecalis chromogenic collinstant agar scharlab for e coli thiosulfate citrate bile salts sucrose agar pronadisa condalab for vibrio spp and marine agar scharlab for mhb plates were incubated for 24 72 h at 30 c vibrio spp and mhb or 37 c e faecalis and e coli according to the specific microorganism in order to ensure a measurable number of cfus ideally 15 150 cfu tenfold dilutions from each sample were plated in triplicate 2 3 experimental set up experimentation was conducted in batch mode at room temperature two different persulfate salts were used sodium peroxydisulfate pds na2s2o8 98 panreac applichem and potassium peroxymonosulfate pms khso5 0 5khso4 0 5k2so4 oxone sigma aldrich firstly preliminary dark tests were performed to determine whether the application of pds and pms reagents in the tested water matrices are capable of inactivating bacteria without the intervention of uv radiation once the three water matrices were prepared according to section 2 1 different doses of persulfate salts 0 005 1 mm were applied in the absence of uv irradiation the bacterial inactivation was evaluated comparing the samples taken at the beginning of the reaction time 0 at 30 min and at 60 min secondly photochemical tests were performed by using a collimated beam reactor equipped with a low pressure uv c lamp wedeco 10 w as a source of light a complete description of the photo reactor including the uv dose measurements have been clearly specified in the supplementary material text s 1 fig s1 the experimental set up has been defined according to previous studies moreno andrés et al 2019 2016 briefly the experiments were arranged by exposing 20 ml samples of water spiked with different microorganisms to the collimated beam reactor each sample was held in a borosilicate petri dish and underwent uv radiation under regular exposure times which implies different uv doses ranging from zero to approximately 60 mj cm 2 persulfate salts were added in a single dosage before uv radiation three experimental treatments were defined in this study i exposure to uv radiation uv ii uv radiation sodium peroxydisulfate uv pds and iii uv radiation potassium peroxymonosulfate uv pms applied to the three selected water matrices section 2 1 with different types of bacteria section 2 2 the efficacy of the inactivation of each system was assessed according to three experimental phases i optimization of the dose of persulfate salts in order to determine the most efficient reagent concentration several concentrations of pds 0 05 0 2 0 5 1 mm and pms 0 005 0 05 0 2 mm were tested these tests were performed with dw and e faecalis as bacterial indicator ii water matrix with results obtained from the optimization phase it is necessary to apply these concentrations in water matrices that are more complex in order to simulate the reality in saline waters thus three different water matrices dw asw sw were assessed with e faecalis as the bacterial indicator iii ultimately the three different treatments uv uv pds uv pms were validated in real seawater by focusing on the effects on different bacteria e coli vibrio spp and mhb in order to obtain a complete scenario of the disinfection process the regrowth of bacteria was monitored in the last step after inactivation assays water samples were stored in sterile containers in darkness at ambient temperature during 48 h and were subsequently microbiologically analyzed 2 4 data analysis microbial inactivation was assessed with dose response curves mean bacterial counts were represented as the logarithmic reduction of the survival microorganisms log n n0 according to the initial concentration of microorganisms 105 106 cfu ml 1 the detection limit was defined as 4 69 5 70 decimal log reductions modeling of inactivation kinetics was performed according to the log lineal tail model which is most appropriate for discontinuous reactors moreno andrés et al 2017 this model is primarily based on the maximum inactivation rate constant assuming that there will be no more inactivation in the tailing phase due to resistance mechanisms the traditional equation eq 1 of first order inactivation kinetics plus the added tail parameter is based on the bacterial concentration at a certain uv dose nd cfu ml 1 which is a function that depends on the initial concentration of microorganisms n0 cfu ml 1 the residual cell concentration or tail starting point nres cfu ml 1 the dose of exposure uv dose mj cm 2 and the specific inactivation rate constant kmax cm2 mj 1 the ginafit software was used to fit the inactivation results on the kinetic model and it was validated by using both the coefficient of determination r2 0 91 and the root mean square deviation rmse was in the range of 0 27 0 39 1 n d n 0 n r e s e k max uv dose n r e s persulfate concentration was monitored spectrophotometrically at the beginning and at the end of each assay at 512 nm for pds and at 395 nm for pms according to the protocols proposed by liang et al 2008 and wacławek et al 2015 also the colorimetric dpd method was used as a complementary analytical method for determining oxidant species it is accepted for water analysis by standard protocols and recommended for seawater buchan et al 2005 the evolution of sulfates was also monitored by ion chromatography see section 2 1 this measurement determines whether there are changes in water quality due to increases in sulfate which is a potential product of photochemical activation of persulfates for bacterial regrowth analysis the percentage of dark regrowth was calculated according to lindenauer and darby 1994 the percentage of bacterial regrowth was calculated according to eq 2 by taking into account the concentration of viable bacteria of the reactivated sample nr cfu ml 1 and the concentration of viable bacteria before n0 cfu ml 1 and after disinfection treatment n cfu ml 1 2 r e g r o w t h n r n n 0 n 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of pds and pms without activation preliminary tests were performed in order to estimate operational conditions together with an assessment of the disinfection efficiency of different persulfate salts i e without activation by light it was carried out in dw with e faecalis as the target organism the range tested was 0 005 1 mm for both pds and pms the results are represented in fig 1 according to the results that were obtained it can be seen that only minor inactivation rates are obtained at different concentrations that are tested this slight inactivation can be due to the oxidation potential of both pds 2 01 v and pms 1 8 v ghanbari and moradi 2017 wacławek et al 2017 but also due to the stability of different salts it is known that pms is less stable than pds wen et al 2019 it is also worth mentioning that with the tests that were performed with a dose of 1 mm of pms the oxidation process seriously affected the population of e faecalis data not shown therefore that can result in major inactivation rates at higher concentrations as it has been reported previously rodríguez chueca et al 2018 2017b nonetheless within the range of concentrations tested in fig 1 persulfate salts never reach a log reduction within the 60 min of reaction this is in accordance with previous studies in which it is reported that such a concentration of persulfates does not influence the viability of this type of bacteria bianco et al 2017 rodríguez chueca et al 2017a nor with other types of organisms such as some phytoplankton species ahn et al 2013 thus it is assured that the effects reported in the next sections resulting from the effect produced by the combination of uv radiation and pds or pms 3 2 optimization process based on pds pms dose as a first step different concentrations of pds and pms were tested in the simplest distilled water matrix dw fig 2 an improvement of uv disinfection is obtained in all cases thus the detection limit is reached more rapidly as the chemical concentration increases concentrations of 0 5 mm pds and 0 05 mm pms were the most effective in dw it suggests a major bactericidal effect for the uv pms system other authors described similar results and report the largest efficiencies for pms compared to pds rodríguez chueca et al 2019 2018 for quantitative assessment of the inactivation kinetic modeling was performed with a non linear adjustment of experimental points eq 1 the kinetic parameters that were obtained are presented in table 2 it can also be visually seen in the inner box of fig 2 kinetic rate constants are in the range of previous studies e g moreno andrés et al 2019 reported a kmax value of 0 65 0 10 cm2 mj 1 for pds at 1 mm similar studies with the same bacterial strain also report comparable results koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005 therefore the improvement from adding persulfates increased the efficacy by up to 109 for 0 5 mm of pds and 0 05 mm of pms based on the increase in kmax with respect to the treatment with uv sole in dw the uv dose necessary for reaching a 4 log reduction table 2 d4 shows the same tendency and reports in the best of cases a reduction in the uv dose of 57 for reaching 4 log reductions in the presence of ps salts compared to uv sole another interesting parameter is the residual population density nres which is responsible for the tail phenomenon and can be useful for understanding the disinfection efficiency of the system since the faster nres formation could be associated with a more rapid inactivation activation of persulfates through uv irradiation produced the homolysis of peroxide bond and generates so4 pds and both so4 and oh pms with a quantum yield at λ 254 nm of ϕpds 1 4 mol e 1 and ϕpms 0 52 mol e 1 respectively wacławek et al 2017 wang and wang 2018 in the case of pms it is important to mention the generation of sulfur pentoxide radical so5 which is produced by the reaction of so4 with hso5 eq 3 so5 has lower oxidation potential 1 1 v but can inflict important damage for bacteria as recently reported by rodríguez chueca et al 2019 3 so 4 h s o 5 so 5 h s o 4 this activation method implies a higher disinfection efficiency as shown in the results and as similarly reported by other studies michael kordatou et al 2015 rodríguez chueca et al 2019 2018 serna galvis et al 2018 wang et al 2016 as observed in fig 2 and table 2 it is worth mentioning that a higher concentration of persulfate salts does not always result in higher inactivation rates in this sense it is expected that recombination and parasitic reactions dominate the system and decrease in efficiency amasha et al 2018 when that happens it suggests that a critical inhibition level is reached for persulfate activation michael kordatou et al 2015 these phenomena have been previously reported in disinfection studies e g by rodríguez chueca et al 2017b who found a decrease in inactivation efficiency b mycoides when the concentration increased from 0 1 to 0 5 mm of pms therefore 0 05 0 005 mm pms and 0 5 mm of pds have been selected as optimal oxidant doses for the next sub sections the production of primary radicals together with the oxidant power of persulfate salts may induce the acceleration of the disinfection at least in dw otherwise other factors such as water dissolved compounds or the membrane cell composition of different organisms can help to clarify inactivation mechanisms of different systems since primary radicals are not always responsible for disinfection sun et al 2016 this will be discussed in the next sub sections 3 3 effect of water matrix the selected doses of pds and pms from the optimization phase section 3 2 were applied in saline water matrices in order to determine the inactivation of bacteria in a real scenario this effect was analyzed from an artificial saltwater matrix with nacl asw followed with real seawater sw the results are presented in fig 3 the individual effect of each persulfate salt on inactivation of e faecalis under dark conditions and at room temperature was analyzed i e without the activation effect by uv radiation fig 3a in the case of pds 0 5 mm a slow decrease in population of up to 0 7 log red was observed after 60 min of reaction on the other hand a higher bactericidal effect was detected with pms thus bacterial population was noticeably damaged during 60 min of reaction in saltwater at a dose of 0 05 mm therefore it was decided to continue using a lower dose of 0 005 mm of pms in which inconsequential inactivation was achieved during dark tests fig 3a those results accord with previous studies in which inactivation rates were higher than 1 log reduction in dark conditions at doses higher than 0 1 mm for pms and 0 5 mm for pds in the case of wastewater rodríguez chueca et al 2018 or saltwater wen et al 2019 the strong effect of pms on bacterial inactivation at concentrations 0 005 mm is probably due to its low stability and interaction with chloride which led to the generation of hclo cl2 species eqs 4 and 5 rivas and solís 2018 recently wen et al 2019 studied this system in depth and reported high inactivation values caused mainly by the formation of chlorine species therefore it is important to take into account the reactivity of persulfates according to the composition of the treated water matrix according to the results obtained in dark tests inactivation assays in uv persulfate systems were performed with 0 5 mm pds and 0 005 mm pms fig 3b and c 4 c l h s o 5 hclo s o 4 2 5 h c l hclo h 2 o c l 2 a uv sole process was used as a control to assess the improvement when pds or pms salts were added into the system it is expected that dissolved ions could act as scattering or absorbing compounds that reduce efficacy chen et al 2016 otherwise slightly higher inactivation rates were obtained in both asw kmaxuv 0 37 0 03 cm2 mj 1 and sw kmaxuv 0 34 0 05 cm2 mj 1 compared to dw kmaxuv 0 31 0 05 cm2 mj 1 thus high salinity could imply stress on e faecalis which might lead to greater sensitivity to the uv treatment hess erga et al 2019 moreno andrés et al 2017 romero martínez et al 2014 for the uv pds system s2o8 2 0 5 mm it can be seen that there is improvement in the disinfection in both water matrices asw kmaxpds 0 46 0 06 cm2 mj 1 sw kmaxpds 0 57 0 08 cm2 mj 1 otherwise the improvement is reduced if it is compared with dw the enhancement on kmax is reduced from 109 in dw till 67 6 in sw fig 4 a for the uv pms system hso5 0 005 mm the inactivation rates observed were asw kmaxpms 0 52 0 08 cm2 mj 1 sw kmaxpms 0 61 0 09 cm2 mj 1 in this case an increase is observed compared to dw the enhancement on kmax rise from 32 2 in dw till 79 4 in sw fig 4a therefore inactivation rates follow the trend of uv pms uv pds uv in both saline waters fig 4 if we evaluate the results with another interesting parameter such as d4 defined as the uv dose necessary for reach 99 99 of inactivation i e the 4 log removal value the same trend can be seen fig 4b the uv dose for reaching a 4 log reduction was smaller for a uv persulfate system than for the single uv system it also suggests a higher disinfection efficiency of pms against pds in high salinity waters those results clearly reflect that there is interference in persulfate systems when salinity increases the improvement on kmax was reduced for uv pds treatment compared to distilled water otherwise best efficiencies based on the increase in kmax were obtained for uv pms in salty waters as compared to dw if it is assumed that in a uv pds system the production rate of so4 as a primary radical is higher than in a uv pms system due to the higher stability of pds and because pms activation implies a generation of both oh and so4 then the scavenging of so4 by dissolved ions will be higher in a uv pds system these phenomena have been deeply studied by sun et al 2016 or yang et al 2014 and could explain the detrimental effects observed in salty waters on inactivation kinetics on the other hand the lower stability of pms together with the higher reaction rates with chlorides to form chlorine species eqs 4 and 5 which can also participate in the inactivation of cells in fact it has been previously reported that this combination pms cl is sufficient to cause the destruction of the cell membrane wen et al 2019 and enhance disinfection rates some interesting trends can also be noticed in the specific water matrix fig 4 the efficiency of uv pms system is enhanced according to sw asw dw otherwise the trend of uv pds is dw sw asw in asw nacl matrix the main dissolved anion is chloride several studies e g nihemaiti et al 2018 yang et al 2014 demonstrate that chloride can act as a radical scavenger and result in different reactive halogen species cl cl2 table s1 that have less oxidant power but are still capable of oxidizing e g organics guan et al 2018 nihemaiti et al 2018 yang et al 2014 and might promote inactivation of bacteria in real sw the appearance of bromide is particularly important due to the strong scavenging rate of both oh and so4 grebel 2010 lu et al 2015 lutze et al 2014 yang et al 2014 as a result the formation of reactive halogen species such as br br2 hbro table s1 can also occur lu et al 2015 lutze et al 2014 yang et al 2014 it is worth noticing that cl oxidation is more favored by so4 than oh yang et al 2014 hence the highest concentration of chlorides and other ions from sw matrix can reduce the efficacy especially in uv pds system as observed in our results according to these assumptions both uv pds and uv pms systems are affected by the specific contents of dissolved inorganic ions in water nonetheless the efficiency of inactivation always increases when persulfate salts are added to the water the effects of this enhancement can be caused by i persulfate itself and related species mainly chlorinated originated by direct reaction with dissolved compounds such as chloride it allows the diffusion of oxidant species in the subsurface before persulfate activation marjanovic et al 2018 wen et al 2019 and ii the activation of persulfates by uv which induces the generation of primary radicals and related halogens radicals that can still inflict cell damage sun et al 2016 yang et al 2014 therefore both diffusion and photo activation processes may be involved in cell inactivation similar results were obtained by bianco et al 2017 and wang et al 2016 who found an improvement in the inactivation of different types of organisms in the presence of chloride 3 4 effect on different organisms the various systems uv uv pds uv pms were also tested with different bacteria two very well established indicators e faecalis and e coli and two groups of typical bacteria from marine waters vibrio spp and marine heterotrophic bacteria mhb disinfection profiles from the different systems are represented in fig 5 the uv c sensitivity of different microorganisms follows the trend vibrio spp e coli e faecalis mhb as expected gram positive organisms such as e faecalis have greater resistance to uv treatments in comparison with gram negative hijnen et al 2006 it can be related to the thickness of the peptidoglycan layer a thinner layer existent in gram negative bacteria implies a better uv propagation through the genetic material santos et al 2013 interestingly a major enhancement was detected in a uv pds system for gram negative bacteria compared to gram positive fig 5 it has been demonstrated that sulfate radicals and related sub species have more affinity with electron rich compounds which suggests their selectivity for reacting with these moieties nihemaiti et al 2018 accordingly and assuming that major so4 can be generated in a uv pds system the electron rich moieties on the bacterial surface can be an easy target of sulfate radicals gram negative bacteria have also major surface bond macromolecules such as proteins or a lipopolysaccharide layer which are extracellular targets for radical species dalrymple et al 2010 wordofa et al 2017 in contrast in a uv pms system there is not a clear trend but slight improvements were detected in e faecalis and mhb fig 5 which suggests that diffusion of oxidative species in solution through the porous peptidoglycan layer may dominate in this system nonetheless according to the sensitivity of different microorganisms results suggest higher sensitivity to both uv and uv persulfate based processes for gram negative bacteria e faecalis and the community of marine heterotrophic bacteria showed similar inactivation rates which recommend that as good model microorganism s for evaluating inactivation efficiency in high salinity waters bianco et al 2017 hess erga et al 2019 moreno andrés et al 2018a romero martínez et al 2014 3 5 residual effect a post treatment scenario was assessed in order to investigate if the possible residual pds or pms salts oxidant can help to avoid the regrowth of bacteria and consequent recolonization of the water bodies which takes significance in the case of marine microorganisms hess erga et al 2019 it could be an advantage in the case of for example ballast tanks in which the water is stored during a journey samples after treatment were saved and analyzed for a pds pms concentration just at the end the experimentation five min of uv c irradiation additional measurements of total residual oxidant in a solution measured as free chlorine and the concentration of microorganisms were determined at regular intervals up to 48 h after treatment the percentage of regrowth of each bacterial group can be seen in table 3 a major regrowth capability is obtained for marine bacteria compared to fecal bacteria besides the cellular damage obtained in different inactivation processes salinity effects can influence this recovery after treatment as an extra factor i e fecal bacteria are affected by salinity which is contrary to specific marine bacteria giannakis et al 2014 moreno andrés et al 2018a moreover it is more pronounced in e coli than in e faecalis byappanahalli et al 2012 oguma et al 2013 as is the trend observed in regrowth results table 3 additionally greater cell damage occurs in the two uv persulfate systems which decrease the regrowth rates in all organisms compared to the uv treatment it can be attributed in addition to the higher cell damage to the residual oxidant that remains in the solution which can easily accumulate in bacterial cells due to the previous damage obtained through inactivation processes in this sense it is worth mentioning that only slight consumption of pds was detected during the experimentation 5 in the case of pms it increased in the range of 15 25 these slight consumption rates were previously reported by e g miralles cuevas et al 2018 the absence of toxic effects from residual persulfate on the health and welfare of marine organisms has also been demonstrated ciulli et al 2017 on the other hand the formation of free chlorine as a product of the oxidation of chlorides by either so4 or hso5 has been already reported anipsitakis et al 2008 rivas and solís 2018 and confirmed in our experiments fig s2 so that can favor diffusion processes inside the cell and avoid regrowth especially on most sensitive bacteria such as vibrio spp furthermore the added sulfates that can be formed as a residual product of uv persulfate systems have been monitored in both dw and sw matrices in sw matrices the background levels of sulfates mask the increase when adding ps salts it was quantified in a 1 8 pds 1 mm and measured after five min of uv c irradiation on the contrary this increment becomes significant in dw which counts for a 62 7 82 4 increase in the level of sulfates after both the uv pds and the uv pms applications these results confirm our hypothesis that the uv persulfate systems are consistent with the chemistry of typical marine waters in which the addition of residual sulfate derived from ps salts is irrelevant due to the relatively high concentration of dissolved inorganic ions especially so4 2 in such water matrices 4 conclusions in this study the enhancement of seawater uv disinfection was investigated with the addition of two different persulfate salts disinfection efficiency has been assessed with several factors such as the dose of persulfates the water matrix and the specific bacteria the addition of persulfate salts is able to promote inactivation of e faecalis in distilled water artificial saltwater nacl and real seawater concentrations below 1 mm are sufficient to increase kinetic rate constants up to 109 in distilled water which involves a reduction in the uv dose of 57 for achieving 4 log reductions in the presence of persulfates compared to uv in high salinity water matrices dissolved inorganic ions affect inactivation processes differently in uv pds than in uv pms systems the lower stability of pms facilitates the interaction with chlorides and enhances the disinfection efficiency in salty waters by up to 79 4 based on the increase in kmax at hso5 0 005 mm on the other hand a uv pds system s2o8 2 0 5 mm is negatively affected in the presence of dissolved ions nonetheless it always improved uv inactivation by testing the uv persulfate systems in different bacteria e coli and vibrio spp were the most sensitive bacteria as compared of e faecalis and the community of marine heterotrophic bacteria by analyzing regrowth in a post treatment scenario the lowest recolonization rates were obtained for uv persulfate systems versus uv treatment suggesting greater damage when using persulfates additionally the total residual oxidant in a solution can be responsible for deterring regrowth in parallel the specific marine bacteria show higher ability to recover in a post treatment scenario against fecal bacteria suggesting the use of specific marine microorganisms when evaluating disinfection systems related to marine waters conflicts of interest there are no conflicts of interest to declare acknowledgments this research has been developed under the r d project avante ctm2014 52116 r funded by the spanish ministry
