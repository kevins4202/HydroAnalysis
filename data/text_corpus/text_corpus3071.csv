15355,the fate and transport of nanoparticles nps in streams is critical for understanding their overall environmental impact using a unique field scale stream at the notre dame linked experimental ecosystem facility we investigated the impact of biofilms and the presence of dissolved organic matter dom on the transport of titanium dioxide tio2 nps experimental breakthrough curves were analyzed using temporal moments and fit using a mobile immobile model the presence of biofilms in the stream severely reduced the transport of the tio2 nps but this was mitigated by the presence of dom under minimal biofilm conditions the presence of dom increased the mass recovery of tio2 from 4 2 to 32 for samples taken 50 m downstream for thriving biofilm conditions only 0 5 of the tio2 mass was recovered 50 m but the presence of dom improved the mass recovery tio2 to 36 the model was suitable for predicting early peak tail and truncation time portions of the breakthrough curves which attests to its ability to capture a range of processes in the mobile and immobile domains of the stream the model outcomes supported the hypothesis that dom changed the interaction of np biofilm from an irreversible to a reversible process collectively these outcomes stress the importance of considering biogeological complexity when predicting the transport of nps in streams keywords nanoparticles titanium dioxide streams transport field scale mobile immobile biofilms dissolved organic matter data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction engineered nanoparticles nps are widely used in consumer industrial agricultural and pharmaceutical products fei yin et al 2013 pan and xing 2012 volder et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 during their life cycle nps can enter streams through various pathways e g wastewater treatment plants choi et al 2017 westerhoff et al 2011 and streams are efficient transport networks that can potentially move the nps throughout the environment thus proper risk assessment of nps requires an understanding of their fate and transport in streams this has proven difficult due to the complexity arising from a combination of enumerable stream biogeological conditions and np physical chemical properties that are difficult to measure in the environment the transport of nps in streams is typically simplified at the lab scale using batch or column reactors to simulate np behavior in the water column or the porous media of the streambed respectively darlington et al 2009 wang et al 2016 while these experiments are valuable for understanding specific mechanisms e g homoaggregation as a function of various parameters e g ph field scale transport studies are a necessary step for ultimately understanding transport in realistic systems as depicted in fig 1 streams are complex reactive systems with rapid turbulent flows in the water column mobile domain connected to slower flows in the streambed substrate relatively immobile domain newbold et al 2005 as nps move downstream they can aggregate settle and deposit at the water streambed interface or be driven into the streambed via advective hyporheic exchange through hyporheic exchange nps can be temporarily retained in the streambed or entirely removed via physical storage newbold et al 2005 or hyporheic benthic biofilms arnon et al 2010 battin et al 2003 roche et al 2017 nps that are not irreversibly deposited in the streambed or biological media will be resuspended and arrive downstream at an orders of magnitude longer timescale than nps moving through the water column only prior studies on the transport behavior of ultra fine particles in streams have mostly involved naturally occurring particles such as clays silts particulate organic matter microbes and metal oxides areepitak and ren 2011 arnon et al 2010 drummond et al 2014a 2014b minshall et al 2000 packman et al 2000 ren and packman 2005 from strictly a size perspective finite differences are expected between engineered nps and naturally occurring ultrafine particles that have a nominal diameter less than 1 μm but potential transport behavior variations could arise between the two due to the unique physical chemical properties of engineered nps studies focused on the transport of nps in streams have been mostly limited to controlled laboratory experiments battin et al 2009 boncagni et al 2009 with only a few studies using realistic field scale experiments kim et al 2019 boncagni et al 2009 investigated the transport of titanium dioxide tio2 nps using flume column and batch laboratory experiments they observed the nps to aggregate in the water column and deposit in the streambed with both streambed velocity and ph playing a critical role in the detachment and resuspension of the nps into the stream two different engineered tio2 nps were used yet their transport behavior was dissimilar due to differences in their surface chemistry battin et al 2009 investigated the effect of biofilms on the transport of two tio2 nps in a laboratory column the transport behavior was heavily influenced by the presence of biofilms with downstream travel distances reduced approximately two and a half fold this agreed with outcomes for naturally occurring particulates battin et al 2008 but again notable differences were observed for the two tio2 nps suggesting their specific engineered surface chemistry affected the biogeochemical interactions kim et al 2019 conducted a controlled field stream release transport study for catalytic and food grade tio2 nps the streambed media size presence of biofilms and surface properties of the nps had a marked effect on the transport behavior the mass loss of the tio2 nps in the stream increased with increasing streambed particle size reflecting an increased rate in hyporheic exchange and subsequent retention in the streambed via attachment the tio2 mass loss was exacerbated in the presence of biofilms in the water column and immobile streambed when negatively charge food grade tio2 nps were used the mass recovery increased for all conditions tested compared to the bare catalytic grade tio2 nps which highlights the importance of the np surface charge on transport under realistic stream conditions the presence of dissolved organic matter dom in streams can have a marked effect on the transport of nps yet thus far studies been limited to controlled laboratory bench scale experiments in aqueous systems dom stabilizes nps and enhances transport domingos et al 2009 isaacson and bouchard 2010 li and chen 2012 nason et al 2012 stankus et al 2011 thio et al 2011 vindedahl et al 2016 zhang et al 2009 zhu et al 2014 but dom may also alter the surface charge of the porous streambed media and increase np retention zhou and cheng 2018 this contrasting behavior highlights the importance for exploring realistic stream systems that contain both water column and streambed domains thus the goal of this study was to investigate the impact of biofilms and dom on the transport of nps in field scale streams the stream experiments were conducted at the notre dame linked experimental ecosystem facility nd leef in a 55 m reach lined with mixed sized streambed substrate experiments were conducted in the spring and autumn when biofilms were minimal and thriving in the streams respectively tio2 nps were chosen as a model np due to their widespread use as a whitening agent and ultraviolet light absorbing material in a variety of consumer products allen et al 2002 el sherbiny et al 2014 gondikas et al 2014 johnson et al 2011 keller et al 2014 shi et al 2013 the results of this study are also applicable to a range of ultrafine particles for which no information currently exists at field scale regarding the effect of biofilms and dom the transport breakthrough curves were modeled with a mobile immobile model mim that can capture the commonly observed range of processes relevant to transport in complex environmental systems including heavy tails in breakthrough curves and non exponential retention and reaction processes aubeneau et al 2014 bolster et al 2019 the mim has been successfully used to predict biological and geological particle transport in field scale streams aubeneau et al 2016 2015a 2015b 2014 boano et al 2007 drummond et al 2014a and we have shown it to be an excellent framework for capturing conservative and reactive transport at nd leef in experiments with very strong anomalous transport characteristics roche et al 2019a 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials a commercial catalytic grade tio2 np called p90 was used as a model np donated by evonik essen germany p90 is a mixed phase tio2 consisting of anatase 85 and rutile 15 with an average primary particle size of approximately 12 and 18 nm respectively kim and doudrick 2019 the point of zero charge phzpc of p90 in water as measured by zeta potential analysis is approximately 6 0 kim and doudrick 2019 unless specified otherwise all chemical solutions used in this study were prepared with ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm produced using a barnstead nanopure treatment system thermo fisher scientific rhodamine water tracer rwt c29h29cln2na2o5 acros organics nj usa was used as a conservative solute in the stream experiments and has been previously shown to be a suitable tracer at our field site aubeneau et al 2016 2015a 2015b 2014 shogren et al 2017 the rwt solutions were covered with aluminum foil to prevent any photolytic degradation prior to release the dom was extracted from commercial topsoil that contained no fertilizer premium topsoil model 71130758 scotts oh usa to prepare the dom solution the topsoil was first dispersed in ultrapure water mixed for 30 min and then allowed to settle for 30 min then the top solution was centrifuged at 8000 g for 10 min and the supernatant was passed through a 0 45 µm filter nylon whatman the filtrate dom was stored in an amber bottle at 4 c for later use and analysis the dom extract was diluted 20x and the suva254 was analyzed using a uv vis spectrometer dr6000 hach loveland co usa total organic carbon toc was measured using a toc analyzer toc l shimadzu columbia md usa potter and wimsatt 2005 the toc of the dom solution after dilution was 10 5 mgc l 1 and the suva254 was 5 6 l mgc 1 m 1 which suggests high aromaticity of 40 weishaar et al 2003 2 2 hydrodynamic size and zeta potential of nps in stream water the homoaggregation behavior of tio2 nps was characterized using dynamic light scattering dls and phase analysis light scattering pals nanobrook omni brookhaven instrument corporation holtsville ny dls was used to measure the hydrodynamic diameter and pals was used to measure the zeta potential ζ analyses were conducted in ultrapure water ph 5 2 and stream water ph 8 1 for bare tio2 nps and tio2 nps mixed with dom tio2 dom for dls tio2 powder was added to the target liquid medium i e ultrapure or stream water to achieve a concentration of 10 mg l 1 tio2 dom was prepared similarly but in the presence 5 mgc l 1 of dom the samples were immediately analyzed after vigorously shaking the solutions for 5 s note when tio2 np powder is added to water it rapidly aggregates and it can take multiple hours of mixing or sonication to disperse the nps as such the dls results are used herein to characterize the general homoaggregation behavior as a comparative function of water medium e g stream ultrapure presence of dom and they are not expected to accurately predict the size of the nps during the stream experiments the preparation of samples for zeta potential analysis was identical to dls but tio2 solutions were prepared at a concentration of 100 µg l 1 1 mm kno3 was used as a supporting electrolyte for ultrapure water and no electrolyte was added to the stream water due to the already existing conductivity thirty measurement cycles were conducted at 25 c in triplicate and the average and standard errors are reported the smoluchowski model i e κa 1 f 1 was used to calculate the zeta potential from electrophoretic mobility lowry et al 2016 2 3 stream experiments all field stream experiments were conducted at nd leef located at st patrick s county park in south bend in usa fig 2 a nd leef is a globally unique research facility that at the time of the experiments contained two man made experimental watersheds each consisting of an interconnected pond two stream reaches 4 streams total and a wetland each stream is 0 4 m wide and 55 m long with a hydraulic gradient of 0 0075 the volume of streambed substrate is approximately 3675 l the stream channel base is lined with cement concrete to prevent unwanted interactions with the surrounding environment the streambed is lined with a 1 1 1 volume ratio of sand pea gravel and cobble stone with a d50 size of 0 053 0 67 and 5 cm respectively the streambed media is approximately 10 cm thick prior to turning on the water for the experimental season the streams were biologically reset by removing terrestrial organic matter e g leaves sticks and benthic biofilms by hand the top layer of the streambed 2 5 cm was physically mixed to mobilize and remove any remaining organic matter the substrate was then graded to a mostly flat topography with natural roughness features the stream system is normally fed through a constant head reservoir supplied by groundwater not shown in fig 2a the average hydraulic residence time in the reservoir is about 3 5 days before reaching the streams the water flows from the upper streams into two ponds which then feed into the lower streams typically at the start of the experimental season may the flow from the reservoir is set and all streams receive this water constantly until the end of the season nov the groundwater that feeds the streams is very hard with high ionic strength 19 mm on average and conductivity 507 µs on average which can cause severe np aggregation kim et al 2019 thus to minimize np aggregation in this study all experiments were conducted with the feed from the groundwater reservoir turned off and a separate pump was used to deliver water directly from the pond to the head of the stream 0 88 l s the pond water consisted of groundwater from the previous season and rainwater accumulated while the reservoir pump was turned off the stream experiments were conducted two times during the year first in june when the biofilm growth was minimal figs 2b and s1 and then in september after biofilms were flourishing in the stream fig 2c before each stream release event the ph temperature and conductivity were measured on site samples were also taken for off site analyses including total suspended solids tss total dissolved solids tds chlorophyll a chl a ash free dry mass afdm and the background ti concentration a modified ess 150 1 method wisconsin state lab of hygiene 1991 and the top rock scrape sampling method berkman and canova 2007 were used for the analysis of chl a and afdm respectively detailed methods for stream water characterization are available in the supplementary materials all stream experiments were conducted using a short term pulse injection of 1 l solutions each stream release scenario consisted of three separate experiments rwt tio2 and tio2 dom the mass of the rwt was 121 and 400 mg injected in june and september respectively the mass of the tio2 nps injected was 4 g for all experiments these concentrations were chosen based on prior knowledge about the mass required to maximize the separation between the peak and tail of the breakthrough curves which was controlled by the detection limits of the respective analyses section 2 4 this was necessary to obtain enough data to properly develop the numerical models rwt and tio2 solutions or suspensions were prepared in the lab immediately before traveling to the field site each solution was vigorously mixed for approximately 10 min before the pulse addition for the injection the 1 l solution was rapidly poured into the stream at the head i e 0 m point for the tio2 dom experiment tio2 and dom solutions were not pre mixed rather the 1 l suspension of tio2 4 g l 1 was co released with a 1 l solution of dom 210 mgc l 1 immediately upon injection a timer was started and periodic water column samples were collected at a stream depth approximately halfway to the streambed using 50 ml tubes polypropylene sterile vwr batavia il this was done at points 25 and 50 m downstream each experiment was conducted one time immediately after completing the transport experiment biofilms were collected for later ti analysis detailed methods available in the supplementary materials to avoid cross contamination between tio2 and tio2 dom field experiments were conducted 48 hrs apart background ti analyses confirmed no tio2 existed in the water prior to each experiment though the possibility of tio2 stored in the streambed is justified considering the volume 3675 l and surface area of streambed substrates are much greater than the amount of tio2 used in each experiment the influence from prior experiments is expected to be minimal 2 4 quantification of conservative tracers and nanoparticles rwt concentrations were analyzed using a handheld fluorometer databank turner designs inc san jose usa equipped with a cyclops sensor cyclops 7f turner designs inc the sensor was calibrated in the lab under dark conditions at the 50 m sampling point the sensor was placed parallelly to the streambed and was covered with a cardboard box to prevent interferences from the sunlight the concentration of rwt was measured every 2 s at the 25 m sampling point samples were collected periodically stored in the dark and then the concentration of rwt was measured in the lab tio2 samples collected at 25 and 50 m were quantified using a previously established method kim et al 2019 tio2 samples were digested with a microwave assisted acid digester mars 6 cem corporation matthews nc and then ti concentrations were measured using inductively coupled plasma with optical emission spectroscopy icp oes optima 8000 perkinelmer ma usa tio2 samples 5 ml were vigorously shaken and then added to a teflon microwave digestion vessel pfa cem corporation matthews nc along with 5 ml of concentrated nitric acid 70 trace metal grade fisher scientific hampton nh tio2 samples were heated for 20 min to reach a target temperature of 210 c which was held constant for 45 min 100 μl of an se standard spex certiprep nj usa solution with a nominal concentration of 100 mg l 1 was added to every 20th sample as a surrogate to monitor the efficiency of the tio2 acid digestion after the digestion samples were diluted with hno3 5 v v to a volume of 10 ml and then 1 ml was analyzed using icp oes optima 8000 perkinelmer ma usa yttrium was used as an internal standard and a ti standard solution was purchased from inorganic ventures va usa the method detection limit mdl for ti samples and icp oes was determined using the usepa procedure epa 2016 this returns the minimum concentration of ti that can be reliably detected with 99 confidence for eight replicates we determined an mdl of 2 1 μg tio2 l 1 2 5 analysis and modeling of the stream transport experiments all stream experiment data were analyzed using concentration time plot or breakthrough curve btc datasets a temporal moment analysis of the btcs was conducted to obtain the mass recovery mrec mean arrival time μ and variance or measure of the plume spread σ 2 eqs 1 3 leube et al 2012 c x t is the concentration at the downstream longitudinal location x and time t 1 m r e c q c x t d t 2 μ q t c x t d t 3 σ 2 q t μ 2 c x t d t the stream transport data was modeled using a mobile immobile model mim that is based on continuous time random walk ctrw theory berkowitz et al 2006 boano et al 2007 and built on previous advancements by roche et al 2019b a key component of this mim relative to standard ones is that immobile processes are not assumed to be exponential the one dimensional ctrw model conceptualizes mass transport in the stream as a continuous exchange of mass between mobile water column and immobile streambed domains model parameters are relatable to physical and chemical processes in a stream with impermeable beds boano et al 2007 such as stream velocity and dispersion temporary storage in low velocity zones and permanent mass immobilization e g via irreversible filtration the stream at nd leef has a single low velocity domain hyporheic zone and well controlled flow conditions aubeneau et al 2014 roche et al 2018 conservative transport is described by a convolution equation of the advection dispersion equation with a memory kernel eq 4 4 c x t t 0 t m t t u c x t x d 2 c x t x 2 d t where u l t 1 is the average mobile zone velocity d l2 t 1 is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient c x t is the in stream concentration m l 3 x is the longitudinal position t is the elapsed time and m t is the memory kernel determined by the rate of mass immobilization and residence times in the immobile domain and reaction rates when considering reactive processes mass immobilization i e hyporheic exchange is modeled as a first order process with rate parameter λ t 1 which assumes rapid mixing of mass in the water column typically a reasonable assumption for a turbulent flow residence times in the immobile domain are parameterized with a probability distribution previous studies show that a truncated power law tpl distribution is a suitable choice for nd leef streams aubeneau et al 2016 2014 dentz et al 2004 the tpl assumes that residence time probability follows a t β power law up to a truncation timescale t after which the probability tempers exponentially the power law exponent or log slope β of this function represents the slope of the tail of the btc and describes the residence time in the immobile region t describes the time point that all reversible mass is recovered these hydrodynamic transport parameters were determined using data from rwt btcs we found best fit model parameters by using the objective function developed by kelly et al 2017 which minimizes summed squared errors sse between modeled and measured concentrations rwt is a conservative tracer sensitive only to the velocity distribution in the water column and porous streambeds mcinnis et al 2014 this allows parameters that describe the purely hydrodynamic processes of the stream i e u d λ β and t to be estimated which can then be used to predict the specific reactive transport parameters of the tio2 nps we used the parameters obtained from the 50 m sampling point of the rwt experiments under minimal and thriving biofilm conditions the transport difference between rwt and the tio2 nps was assumed to be controlled only by parameters that describe permanent mass immobilization in either the mobile or immobile domains kmobile and kimmobile respectively roche et al 2019a mathematically kmobile and kimmobile modify eq 4 as permanent first order removal processes in the mobile and immobile parts of memory function m t aubeneau et al 2015a kmobile t 1 describes the first order removal rate of nps in the mobile domain that includes the water column kimmobile t 1 describes the first order removal rate of nps in the immobile domain that includes the streambed the use of independent trapping rates allows us to relate changes in best fit model parameters to physical changes in each domain between experiments interactions that occur at the interface between the mobile and immobile phases may be described by either parameter but there was insufficient data available to distinguish which controls the interfacial processes as such the tio2 transport parameters were fixed to the best fit values from rwt experiments i e u d λ β t and then kmobile and kimmobile were allowed to vary to obtain a minimized sse this modeling approach using ctrw may have limitations such as variabilities in modeling outcomes e g model parameters depending on the quality accuracy and precision of the experimental data which is attributed to the detection limit of analytical instruments and limited monitoring time i e no long term observation of irreversibility each of the hydrodynamic and reactive transport parameters will affect the shape of the btc fig 3 as simulated previously aubeneau et al 2015a in the mobile domain i e water column u will alter the arrival times e g peak mean of the btc and d will affect the spread of peak λ and β will represent the immobile domain effects i e subsurface which manifests in the tail portion of the btc λ affects the onset concentration of the tail but it does not affect the slope a lower λ means that less mass is entering the subsurface and thus stays in the mobile region longer this would result in a lower onset concentration of the tail and subsequently a lower t since the mass will leave the immobile domain earlier the inverse of λ is the average amount of time a particle will spend in the surface before being exchanged with the subsurface lower β values will result in longer residence times in the immobile domain and produces heavier tails of the btc kmobile represents irreversible uptake in the water column kmobile will affect the peak concentration and the peak and mean arrival times it will also affect the onset concentration of the tail and its cutoff but not the onset time onset concentration or the slope of the tail increasing kmobile will result in a decreased btc peak concentration and early arrival times as less mass interacts with slower subsurface flows and the onset concentration and cutoff of the tail will be earlier than for a conservative tracer as a general qualitative representation kimmobile is the irreversible uptake in the subsurface kimmobile will not affect the peak concentration of its arrival time but it can affect the shape and length of the tail which will result in changes to the mean arrival time and t increasing kimmobile will result in steeper tail slopes with an early t and early mean arrival time 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the stream water and tio2 homoaggregation behavior the ph conductivity chl a and afdm of the stream were analyzed prior to each experiment table 1 tss and tds were measured once in june and in september there were only minimal differences in temperature ph conductivity and tds marked changes in tss chl a and afdm from june to september were observed due to seasonal biofilm growth i e fig 2 though specific distinctions were not made about the particulate components contributing to the tss because the stream conditions are constant from june to september the change in tss was presumably due to the addition of particulate organic matter from in stream biofilm growth the background concentration of ti was below the icp oes mdl for all samples the homoaggregation behavior of the tio2 nps in the stream water was assessed by analyzing the changes in hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential over approximately 1 hr fig 4 a in ultrapure water the initial 1 min hydrodynamic diameter of tio2 was approximately 261 5 5 nm and this was constant for 24 hrs 256 2 9 nm not shown in contrast the initial 1 min hydrodynamic diameter of tio2 in stream water was 648 45 nm which was significantly larger than the hydrodynamic diameter in ultrapure water p 0 05 throughout the experiment hydrodynamic diameter of tio2 increased and reached 865 17 nm after approximately 1 hr this marked increase compared to ultrapure water is attributed to the higher conductivity i e ionic strength of the stream water in either case though the addition of tio2 to water resulted in the aggregation of particles with a cluster size an order of magnitude greater than the average primary particle size 15 nm no significant differences p 0 05 were observed between filtered and unfiltered stream water not shown suggesting that any suspended organic or inorganic matter present in the stream did not affect the stability of the tio2 nps similarly no difference was observed between tio2 samples in ultrapure water analyzed after seconds of mixing compared to multiple hours of mixing not shown for tio2 dom in stream water the initial 1 min hydrodynamic size was 306 15 nm and this increased only slightly to 362 31 nm after approximately 1 hr the significant difference between the hydrodynamic diameters of tio2 and tio2 dom in the stream water p 0 05 suggests that the dom protects the tio2 nps from aggregation in high ionic strength waters the average zeta potentials of 18 8 0 53 and 16 1 1 8 mv ph 8 1 for tio2 and tio2 dom in stream water respectively were relatively steady over approximately 1 hr fig 4b dom can adsorb to the np surface and stabilize them against aggregation aiken et al 2011 jayalath et al 2018 stankus et al 2011 though the zeta potential difference between tio2 and tio2 dom was significant p 0 05 the small difference suggests that the enhanced stability caused by dom was due to steric hindrance rather than electrostatic repulsion from negatively charged functional groups 3 2 temporal moment analysis of btcs fig 5 a shows the btcs of tio2 and tio2 dom in the presence of minimal biofilms at the 25 m and 50 m sampling points log scale plots are also presented to visually resolve the tail portion of the btcs fig 5b fig s2 shows the equivalent btcs for the conservative tracer rwt the results of the temporal moment analyses of the btcs are provided in table 2 under minimal and thriving biofilm conditions the mass recovery of rwt at 25 m was approximately 94 and 100 respectively the recovery decreased to 87 as rwt moved downstream to the 50 m point this mass loss of the conservative tracer was presumably due to analytical detection limits and minor non conservative effects e g volume loss from stream sorption furthermore we only sampled the water column portion of the stream and while we assume the subsurface is immobile there will be some slow advection that manifests as apparent mass loss roche et al 2019a for all conditions tested the mass recovery of tio2 dom was higher than tio2 under minimal biofilm conditions the mass recovery of tio2 at 25 m was only 14 and nearly all the tio2 had been retained in the stream by 50 m biofilm growth in the stream during these experiments was negligible so the tio2 mass loss was attributed to its interaction with the porous streambed substrate the d50 size ratio np smallest media for tio2 and tio2 dom is 0 0015 and 0 00057 respectively which is much less than the requirement for mechanical filtration to occur in polydisperse granular media kerimov et al 2018 thus the major driving force for tio2 loss in the streambed was presumably attachment via electrostatic interactions while the time scale and detection limits of this study did not allow us to observe the resuspension of the nps previous results suggest that particles attached to biogeological media can be remobilized during high flow events that disturb the streambed cushing et al 1993 drummond et al 2014b newbold et al 2005 under minimal biofilm conditions co releasing dom with tio2 i e tio2 dom enhanced the transport of tio2 compared to experiments using only tio2 with mass recoveries at the 25 m and 50 m sampling points of 47 and 32 respectively the improved transport is presumably due to the adsorption of dom onto tio2 providing a repulsive or steric coating that minimizes the interaction with the stream substrates because dom and tio2 were simultaneously released to the stream without any pre mixing this suggests the adsorption process is fast relative to the stream velocity this hypothesis is supported by previous lab scale results describing the rapid adsorption of dom onto tio2 jayalath et al 2018 kim and doudrick 2019 the mean tm and peak tp arrival times of tio2 and tio2 dom were approximately the same e g tm 8 5 min at 50 m but there was considerably more mass recovered with tio2 dom with a percent change of 87 the delivery of nps to the streambed is controlled by advective hyporheic exchange and gravitational settling would be negligible because both tio2 and tio2 dom particles aggregates are 1000 μm fig 4 collectively these outcomes suggest that the presence of dom reduces the interaction of tio2 with streambed substrates but it does not alter the flow pathway of tio2 e g more transporting in the water column the transport experiments were repeated in september when biofilms were ubiquitous in the stream fig 2c with filamentous biofilms observed within water column and adhered to the streambed water interface the transport of tio2 was considerably reduced in the presence of thriving biofilm conditions with mass recoveries less than 3 observed fig 6 table 2 biofilms in the water column were visually inspected after the transport experiment and there were noticeable white patches on entrapped tio2 fig s3 small samples of biofilms were taken at five points in the stream 0 5 10 25 50 m and then analyzed for tio2 mass assuming the tio2 loading in the biofilm samples was homogeneous and representative of all biofilms at each sampling point most of the tio2 mass loss 95 fig s4 occurred in the first 5 m of the stream with nearly 85 of the total tio2 measured being captured near the tio2 sample injection point i e 0 to 0 5 m this outcome suggests that the mass loss of tio2 due to biofilms is rapid compared to the stream velocity the mass recovery for tio2 dom at 25 m and 50 m 43 and 36 in the presence of thriving biofilms was higher than tio2 2 2 and 0 5 furthermore the mass recovery for tio2 dom under thriving biofilm conditions was not markedly different compared to minimal biofilms conditions 5 difference the mean arrival time for tio2 dom 19 1 min at 50 m was greater than tio2 15 2 m at 50 m in the presence of thriving biofilms this observation contrasted with the similar arrival times observed under minimal biofilms conditions thus the presence of biofilms considerably increases the mass loss of tio2 nps whereas in the presence of dom the biofilms retard the transport of tio2 without irreversibly trapping it 3 4 modeling the transport of tio2 nps in streams the best fit model parameters were obtained from the rwt btcs for minimal and thriving biofilm conditions table 3 the accompanying experimental and modeled btcs for rwt are shown in fig 7 the model was suitable for the early peak tail and truncation time portions of the rwt btcs which highlights its ability to capture a range of spatio temporal phases the presence of thriving biofilms altered the hydrodynamic transport parameters the water column velocity u decreased approximately 25 and the dispersivity d increased approximately 50 which indicates increased mixing in the stream the hyporheic exchange rate λ increased approximately 30 indicating a higher probability of nps being carried by the stream water into the streambed the power law exponent β decreased approximately 10 indicating that nps spent an increased time in the streambed before moving back into the water column this would increase the chances of interaction with the streambed media the parameter values from the 25 m and 50 m sampling points were in relative agreement table s1 but some notable differences were observed e g u for thriving one of the key assumptions of the model is that the stream is well mixed and hydraulically identical throughout the reach but the observed differences suggest some heterogeneity exists overall the transport parameters were quantitatively similar to previous conservative tracer studies conducted in the same stream at nd leef roche et al 2019a aubeneau et al 2016 fig 7 shows the experimental and modeled btcs for tio2 and tio2 dom under minimal and thriving biofilm conditions at the 25 m and 50 m sampling points no model fit was obtained for tio2 at 50 m under thriving biofilm conditions because data was only obtained at three data points due to the large mass loss under minimal biofilm conditions fig 7a and b relatively good model fits were obtained which attests to the model s ability to capture a broad range of transport processes e g aggregation physical retention chemical sorption under thriving biofilm conditions fig 7c and d the predictive capability of the model was reduced there are two explanations for the diminished capability of the model under thriving biofilm conditions the first reason is related to the attachment behavior of the nps to biofilms the model assumes the mass removal process is irreversible at a first order rate described by the k parameters if the interaction between the biofilms and the nps is a reversible attachment detachment process then this would be reflected in an equally re scaled u and d i e u and d are less than what is predicted by the rwt data which is a surrogate for a retardation factor the model predicted earlier arrival times than the experimental data which is influenced by u and d thus re scaling u and d equally would increase the predicted arrival time and more closely matching the experimental data this speculation is supported by the moment analysis outcomes fig 3 the mean arrival times for tio2 and tio2 dom were similar under minimal biofilm conditions but different under thriving conditions which suggests differing retardation factors could be playing a role for the differing surface chemistries of the two tio2 nps the second reason is related to the model determination of the k values during model optimization of the k values the sse continued to decrease until a maximum or minimum k value was reached i e 10 8 however there was a limiting point where decreasing the k by an order of magnitude minimized the sse but did not improve the model fit e g fig s5 for kmobile inaccurate k values would incorrectly predict the mass removed resulting in btcs that are shifted below or above the experimental data e g fig 7d to account for the issues with the model for thriving biofilm conditions u and d were scaled equally and then kmobile and kimmobile parameters were adjusted to obtain a better fit by manually minimizing the sse the λ β t parameters were not adjusted for example for tio2 dom at 50 m under thriving biofilm conditions the shape of the modeled btc fig 7d was too wide with a shallow tail slope and predicted concentrations that were too low and early this means the model was overestimating u and d and both kmobile and kimmobile predictions had convergence errors to account for this u and d were first de scaled equally to account for reversible attachment processes and then the k parameters were optimized kmobile decreased and kimmobile increased thus reducing the mass loss in the water column but increasing the mass loss in the streambed respectively the parameter results for minimal and thriving biofilm conditions are shown in table 4 and the adjusted btcs are shown in fig 8 also listed in table 4 is the kmobile kimmobile ratio which provides some insight into where the mass loss of tio2 occurred in the stream the k ratio for minimal and thriving biofilm conditions was greater for tio2 compared to tio2 dom suggesting greater mass loss in the mobile domain this model outcome agreed with the larger mass loss observed for tio2 table 2 for tio2 the presence of thriving biofilm conditions resulted in a higher k ratio compared to minimal biofilm conditions the increased kmobile was presumably due to mass loss to biofilms present in the water column fig 2c for tio2 dom the k ratio was similar for both biofilm conditions which agrees with experimental results table 2 that indicated the influence of biofilms on the mass recovery of tio2 dom was minimal the modeled parameters reiterate the ability of dom to reduce interactions of tio2 with biofilms and the streambed substrate as a demonstration of the usefulness of the model and implications of the findings the distance the tio2 nps must travel in the stream to reach a desired percent mass retention was determined table 4 fig 9 for example 99 9 of tio2 nps would be removed from the water column and retained in the streambed after traveling approximately 90 m and 50 m for minimal and thriving biofilm conditions respectively and the presence of dom more than doubles the distance the nps will travel 4 conclusion the transport of nps in streams is heavily influenced by the presence of biofilms and dom when biofilms are present in streams they can immobilize nps resulting in diminished downstream transport this may be exacerbated by the homoaggregation of nps in streams especially those with high ionic strength the presence of dom stabilizes nps against homoaggregation and mitigates the impact of biofilms thus enhancing transport whereas tio2 nps are presumably immobilized in the biofilms the presence of dom causes biofilm np interactions to be reversible these conclusions should be confirmed by extensive lab scale studies when dom interacts with tio2 nps it adsorbs to and covers the surface of the np thus changes the surface identity of the np kim and doudrick 2019 louie et al 2016 2013 so though the results presented herein are specific for tio2 the transport of other nps will presumably be similar when dom concentrations are high enough that they coat the surface of the np collectively these findings have significant implications for real world transport of tio2 for example tio2 nps that are present in wastewater effluent will likely be covered with organic macromolecules that stabilize them from aggregation and reduce

15355,the fate and transport of nanoparticles nps in streams is critical for understanding their overall environmental impact using a unique field scale stream at the notre dame linked experimental ecosystem facility we investigated the impact of biofilms and the presence of dissolved organic matter dom on the transport of titanium dioxide tio2 nps experimental breakthrough curves were analyzed using temporal moments and fit using a mobile immobile model the presence of biofilms in the stream severely reduced the transport of the tio2 nps but this was mitigated by the presence of dom under minimal biofilm conditions the presence of dom increased the mass recovery of tio2 from 4 2 to 32 for samples taken 50 m downstream for thriving biofilm conditions only 0 5 of the tio2 mass was recovered 50 m but the presence of dom improved the mass recovery tio2 to 36 the model was suitable for predicting early peak tail and truncation time portions of the breakthrough curves which attests to its ability to capture a range of processes in the mobile and immobile domains of the stream the model outcomes supported the hypothesis that dom changed the interaction of np biofilm from an irreversible to a reversible process collectively these outcomes stress the importance of considering biogeological complexity when predicting the transport of nps in streams keywords nanoparticles titanium dioxide streams transport field scale mobile immobile biofilms dissolved organic matter data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction engineered nanoparticles nps are widely used in consumer industrial agricultural and pharmaceutical products fei yin et al 2013 pan and xing 2012 volder et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 during their life cycle nps can enter streams through various pathways e g wastewater treatment plants choi et al 2017 westerhoff et al 2011 and streams are efficient transport networks that can potentially move the nps throughout the environment thus proper risk assessment of nps requires an understanding of their fate and transport in streams this has proven difficult due to the complexity arising from a combination of enumerable stream biogeological conditions and np physical chemical properties that are difficult to measure in the environment the transport of nps in streams is typically simplified at the lab scale using batch or column reactors to simulate np behavior in the water column or the porous media of the streambed respectively darlington et al 2009 wang et al 2016 while these experiments are valuable for understanding specific mechanisms e g homoaggregation as a function of various parameters e g ph field scale transport studies are a necessary step for ultimately understanding transport in realistic systems as depicted in fig 1 streams are complex reactive systems with rapid turbulent flows in the water column mobile domain connected to slower flows in the streambed substrate relatively immobile domain newbold et al 2005 as nps move downstream they can aggregate settle and deposit at the water streambed interface or be driven into the streambed via advective hyporheic exchange through hyporheic exchange nps can be temporarily retained in the streambed or entirely removed via physical storage newbold et al 2005 or hyporheic benthic biofilms arnon et al 2010 battin et al 2003 roche et al 2017 nps that are not irreversibly deposited in the streambed or biological media will be resuspended and arrive downstream at an orders of magnitude longer timescale than nps moving through the water column only prior studies on the transport behavior of ultra fine particles in streams have mostly involved naturally occurring particles such as clays silts particulate organic matter microbes and metal oxides areepitak and ren 2011 arnon et al 2010 drummond et al 2014a 2014b minshall et al 2000 packman et al 2000 ren and packman 2005 from strictly a size perspective finite differences are expected between engineered nps and naturally occurring ultrafine particles that have a nominal diameter less than 1 μm but potential transport behavior variations could arise between the two due to the unique physical chemical properties of engineered nps studies focused on the transport of nps in streams have been mostly limited to controlled laboratory experiments battin et al 2009 boncagni et al 2009 with only a few studies using realistic field scale experiments kim et al 2019 boncagni et al 2009 investigated the transport of titanium dioxide tio2 nps using flume column and batch laboratory experiments they observed the nps to aggregate in the water column and deposit in the streambed with both streambed velocity and ph playing a critical role in the detachment and resuspension of the nps into the stream two different engineered tio2 nps were used yet their transport behavior was dissimilar due to differences in their surface chemistry battin et al 2009 investigated the effect of biofilms on the transport of two tio2 nps in a laboratory column the transport behavior was heavily influenced by the presence of biofilms with downstream travel distances reduced approximately two and a half fold this agreed with outcomes for naturally occurring particulates battin et al 2008 but again notable differences were observed for the two tio2 nps suggesting their specific engineered surface chemistry affected the biogeochemical interactions kim et al 2019 conducted a controlled field stream release transport study for catalytic and food grade tio2 nps the streambed media size presence of biofilms and surface properties of the nps had a marked effect on the transport behavior the mass loss of the tio2 nps in the stream increased with increasing streambed particle size reflecting an increased rate in hyporheic exchange and subsequent retention in the streambed via attachment the tio2 mass loss was exacerbated in the presence of biofilms in the water column and immobile streambed when negatively charge food grade tio2 nps were used the mass recovery increased for all conditions tested compared to the bare catalytic grade tio2 nps which highlights the importance of the np surface charge on transport under realistic stream conditions the presence of dissolved organic matter dom in streams can have a marked effect on the transport of nps yet thus far studies been limited to controlled laboratory bench scale experiments in aqueous systems dom stabilizes nps and enhances transport domingos et al 2009 isaacson and bouchard 2010 li and chen 2012 nason et al 2012 stankus et al 2011 thio et al 2011 vindedahl et al 2016 zhang et al 2009 zhu et al 2014 but dom may also alter the surface charge of the porous streambed media and increase np retention zhou and cheng 2018 this contrasting behavior highlights the importance for exploring realistic stream systems that contain both water column and streambed domains thus the goal of this study was to investigate the impact of biofilms and dom on the transport of nps in field scale streams the stream experiments were conducted at the notre dame linked experimental ecosystem facility nd leef in a 55 m reach lined with mixed sized streambed substrate experiments were conducted in the spring and autumn when biofilms were minimal and thriving in the streams respectively tio2 nps were chosen as a model np due to their widespread use as a whitening agent and ultraviolet light absorbing material in a variety of consumer products allen et al 2002 el sherbiny et al 2014 gondikas et al 2014 johnson et al 2011 keller et al 2014 shi et al 2013 the results of this study are also applicable to a range of ultrafine particles for which no information currently exists at field scale regarding the effect of biofilms and dom the transport breakthrough curves were modeled with a mobile immobile model mim that can capture the commonly observed range of processes relevant to transport in complex environmental systems including heavy tails in breakthrough curves and non exponential retention and reaction processes aubeneau et al 2014 bolster et al 2019 the mim has been successfully used to predict biological and geological particle transport in field scale streams aubeneau et al 2016 2015a 2015b 2014 boano et al 2007 drummond et al 2014a and we have shown it to be an excellent framework for capturing conservative and reactive transport at nd leef in experiments with very strong anomalous transport characteristics roche et al 2019a 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials a commercial catalytic grade tio2 np called p90 was used as a model np donated by evonik essen germany p90 is a mixed phase tio2 consisting of anatase 85 and rutile 15 with an average primary particle size of approximately 12 and 18 nm respectively kim and doudrick 2019 the point of zero charge phzpc of p90 in water as measured by zeta potential analysis is approximately 6 0 kim and doudrick 2019 unless specified otherwise all chemical solutions used in this study were prepared with ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm produced using a barnstead nanopure treatment system thermo fisher scientific rhodamine water tracer rwt c29h29cln2na2o5 acros organics nj usa was used as a conservative solute in the stream experiments and has been previously shown to be a suitable tracer at our field site aubeneau et al 2016 2015a 2015b 2014 shogren et al 2017 the rwt solutions were covered with aluminum foil to prevent any photolytic degradation prior to release the dom was extracted from commercial topsoil that contained no fertilizer premium topsoil model 71130758 scotts oh usa to prepare the dom solution the topsoil was first dispersed in ultrapure water mixed for 30 min and then allowed to settle for 30 min then the top solution was centrifuged at 8000 g for 10 min and the supernatant was passed through a 0 45 µm filter nylon whatman the filtrate dom was stored in an amber bottle at 4 c for later use and analysis the dom extract was diluted 20x and the suva254 was analyzed using a uv vis spectrometer dr6000 hach loveland co usa total organic carbon toc was measured using a toc analyzer toc l shimadzu columbia md usa potter and wimsatt 2005 the toc of the dom solution after dilution was 10 5 mgc l 1 and the suva254 was 5 6 l mgc 1 m 1 which suggests high aromaticity of 40 weishaar et al 2003 2 2 hydrodynamic size and zeta potential of nps in stream water the homoaggregation behavior of tio2 nps was characterized using dynamic light scattering dls and phase analysis light scattering pals nanobrook omni brookhaven instrument corporation holtsville ny dls was used to measure the hydrodynamic diameter and pals was used to measure the zeta potential ζ analyses were conducted in ultrapure water ph 5 2 and stream water ph 8 1 for bare tio2 nps and tio2 nps mixed with dom tio2 dom for dls tio2 powder was added to the target liquid medium i e ultrapure or stream water to achieve a concentration of 10 mg l 1 tio2 dom was prepared similarly but in the presence 5 mgc l 1 of dom the samples were immediately analyzed after vigorously shaking the solutions for 5 s note when tio2 np powder is added to water it rapidly aggregates and it can take multiple hours of mixing or sonication to disperse the nps as such the dls results are used herein to characterize the general homoaggregation behavior as a comparative function of water medium e g stream ultrapure presence of dom and they are not expected to accurately predict the size of the nps during the stream experiments the preparation of samples for zeta potential analysis was identical to dls but tio2 solutions were prepared at a concentration of 100 µg l 1 1 mm kno3 was used as a supporting electrolyte for ultrapure water and no electrolyte was added to the stream water due to the already existing conductivity thirty measurement cycles were conducted at 25 c in triplicate and the average and standard errors are reported the smoluchowski model i e κa 1 f 1 was used to calculate the zeta potential from electrophoretic mobility lowry et al 2016 2 3 stream experiments all field stream experiments were conducted at nd leef located at st patrick s county park in south bend in usa fig 2 a nd leef is a globally unique research facility that at the time of the experiments contained two man made experimental watersheds each consisting of an interconnected pond two stream reaches 4 streams total and a wetland each stream is 0 4 m wide and 55 m long with a hydraulic gradient of 0 0075 the volume of streambed substrate is approximately 3675 l the stream channel base is lined with cement concrete to prevent unwanted interactions with the surrounding environment the streambed is lined with a 1 1 1 volume ratio of sand pea gravel and cobble stone with a d50 size of 0 053 0 67 and 5 cm respectively the streambed media is approximately 10 cm thick prior to turning on the water for the experimental season the streams were biologically reset by removing terrestrial organic matter e g leaves sticks and benthic biofilms by hand the top layer of the streambed 2 5 cm was physically mixed to mobilize and remove any remaining organic matter the substrate was then graded to a mostly flat topography with natural roughness features the stream system is normally fed through a constant head reservoir supplied by groundwater not shown in fig 2a the average hydraulic residence time in the reservoir is about 3 5 days before reaching the streams the water flows from the upper streams into two ponds which then feed into the lower streams typically at the start of the experimental season may the flow from the reservoir is set and all streams receive this water constantly until the end of the season nov the groundwater that feeds the streams is very hard with high ionic strength 19 mm on average and conductivity 507 µs on average which can cause severe np aggregation kim et al 2019 thus to minimize np aggregation in this study all experiments were conducted with the feed from the groundwater reservoir turned off and a separate pump was used to deliver water directly from the pond to the head of the stream 0 88 l s the pond water consisted of groundwater from the previous season and rainwater accumulated while the reservoir pump was turned off the stream experiments were conducted two times during the year first in june when the biofilm growth was minimal figs 2b and s1 and then in september after biofilms were flourishing in the stream fig 2c before each stream release event the ph temperature and conductivity were measured on site samples were also taken for off site analyses including total suspended solids tss total dissolved solids tds chlorophyll a chl a ash free dry mass afdm and the background ti concentration a modified ess 150 1 method wisconsin state lab of hygiene 1991 and the top rock scrape sampling method berkman and canova 2007 were used for the analysis of chl a and afdm respectively detailed methods for stream water characterization are available in the supplementary materials all stream experiments were conducted using a short term pulse injection of 1 l solutions each stream release scenario consisted of three separate experiments rwt tio2 and tio2 dom the mass of the rwt was 121 and 400 mg injected in june and september respectively the mass of the tio2 nps injected was 4 g for all experiments these concentrations were chosen based on prior knowledge about the mass required to maximize the separation between the peak and tail of the breakthrough curves which was controlled by the detection limits of the respective analyses section 2 4 this was necessary to obtain enough data to properly develop the numerical models rwt and tio2 solutions or suspensions were prepared in the lab immediately before traveling to the field site each solution was vigorously mixed for approximately 10 min before the pulse addition for the injection the 1 l solution was rapidly poured into the stream at the head i e 0 m point for the tio2 dom experiment tio2 and dom solutions were not pre mixed rather the 1 l suspension of tio2 4 g l 1 was co released with a 1 l solution of dom 210 mgc l 1 immediately upon injection a timer was started and periodic water column samples were collected at a stream depth approximately halfway to the streambed using 50 ml tubes polypropylene sterile vwr batavia il this was done at points 25 and 50 m downstream each experiment was conducted one time immediately after completing the transport experiment biofilms were collected for later ti analysis detailed methods available in the supplementary materials to avoid cross contamination between tio2 and tio2 dom field experiments were conducted 48 hrs apart background ti analyses confirmed no tio2 existed in the water prior to each experiment though the possibility of tio2 stored in the streambed is justified considering the volume 3675 l and surface area of streambed substrates are much greater than the amount of tio2 used in each experiment the influence from prior experiments is expected to be minimal 2 4 quantification of conservative tracers and nanoparticles rwt concentrations were analyzed using a handheld fluorometer databank turner designs inc san jose usa equipped with a cyclops sensor cyclops 7f turner designs inc the sensor was calibrated in the lab under dark conditions at the 50 m sampling point the sensor was placed parallelly to the streambed and was covered with a cardboard box to prevent interferences from the sunlight the concentration of rwt was measured every 2 s at the 25 m sampling point samples were collected periodically stored in the dark and then the concentration of rwt was measured in the lab tio2 samples collected at 25 and 50 m were quantified using a previously established method kim et al 2019 tio2 samples were digested with a microwave assisted acid digester mars 6 cem corporation matthews nc and then ti concentrations were measured using inductively coupled plasma with optical emission spectroscopy icp oes optima 8000 perkinelmer ma usa tio2 samples 5 ml were vigorously shaken and then added to a teflon microwave digestion vessel pfa cem corporation matthews nc along with 5 ml of concentrated nitric acid 70 trace metal grade fisher scientific hampton nh tio2 samples were heated for 20 min to reach a target temperature of 210 c which was held constant for 45 min 100 μl of an se standard spex certiprep nj usa solution with a nominal concentration of 100 mg l 1 was added to every 20th sample as a surrogate to monitor the efficiency of the tio2 acid digestion after the digestion samples were diluted with hno3 5 v v to a volume of 10 ml and then 1 ml was analyzed using icp oes optima 8000 perkinelmer ma usa yttrium was used as an internal standard and a ti standard solution was purchased from inorganic ventures va usa the method detection limit mdl for ti samples and icp oes was determined using the usepa procedure epa 2016 this returns the minimum concentration of ti that can be reliably detected with 99 confidence for eight replicates we determined an mdl of 2 1 μg tio2 l 1 2 5 analysis and modeling of the stream transport experiments all stream experiment data were analyzed using concentration time

using a mobile immobile model mim that is based on continuous time random walk ctrw theory berkowitz et al 2006 boano et al 2007 and built on previous advancements by roche et al 2019b a key component of this mim relative to standard ones is that immobile processes are not assumed to be exponential the one dimensional ctrw model conceptualizes mass transport in the stream as a continuous exchange of mass between mobile water column and immobile streambed domains model parameters are relatable to physical and chemical processes in a stream with impermeable beds boano et al 2007 such as stream velocity and dispersion temporary storage in low velocity zones and permanent mass immobilization e g via irreversible filtration the stream at nd leef has a single low velocity domain hyporheic zone and well controlled flow conditions aubeneau et al 2014 roche et al 2018 conservative transport is described by a convolution equation of the advection dispersion equation with a memory kernel eq 4 4 c x t t 0 t m t t u c x t x d 2 c x t x 2 d t where u l t 1 is the average mobile zone velocity d l2 t 1 is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient c x t is the in stream concentration m l 3 x is the longitudinal position t is the elapsed time and m t is the memory kernel determined by the rate of mass immobilization and residence times in the immobile domain and reaction rates when considering reactive processes mass immobilization i e hyporheic exchange is modeled as a first order process with rate parameter λ t 1 which assumes rapid mixing of mass in the water column typically a reasonable assumption for a turbulent flow residence times in the immobile domain are parameterized with a probability distribution previous studies show that a truncated power law tpl distribution is a suitable choice for nd leef streams aubeneau et al 2016 2014 dentz et al 2004 the tpl assumes that residence time probability follows a t β power law up to a truncation timescale t after which the probability tempers exponentially the power law exponent or log slope β of this function represents the slope of the tail of the btc and describes the residence time in the immobile region t describes the time point that all reversible mass is recovered these hydrodynamic transport parameters were determined using data from rwt btcs we found best fit model parameters by using the objective function developed by kelly et al 2017 which minimizes summed squared errors sse between modeled and measured concentrations rwt is a conservative tracer sensitive only to the velocity distribution in the water column and porous streambeds mcinnis et al 2014 this allows parameters that describe the purely hydrodynamic processes of the stream i e u d λ β and t to be estimated which can then be used to predict the specific reactive transport parameters of the tio2 nps we used the parameters obtained from the 50 m sampling point of the rwt experiments under minimal and thriving biofilm conditions the transport difference between rwt and the tio2 nps was assumed to be controlled only by parameters that describe permanent mass immobilization in either the mobile or immobile domains kmobile and kimmobile respectively roche et al 2019a mathematically kmobile and kimmobile modify eq 4 as permanent first order removal processes in the mobile and immobile parts of memory function m t aubeneau et al 2015a kmobile t 1 describes the first order removal rate of nps in the mobile domain that includes the water column kimmobile t 1 describes the first order removal rate of nps in the immobile domain that includes the streambed the use of independent trapping rates allows us to relate changes in best fit model parameters to physical changes in each domain between experiments interactions that occur at the interface between the mobile and immobile phases may be described by either parameter but there was insufficient data available to distinguish which controls the interfacial processes as such the tio2 transport parameters were fixed to the best fit values from rwt experiments i e u d λ β t and then kmobile and kimmobile were allowed to vary to obtain a minimized sse this modeling approach using ctrw may have limitations such as variabilities in modeling outcomes e g model parameters depending on the quality accuracy and precision of the experimental data which is attributed to the detection limit of analytical instruments and limited monitoring time i e no long term observation of irreversibility each of the hydrodynamic and reactive transport parameters will affect the shape of the btc fig 3 as simulated previously aubeneau et al 2015a in the mobile domain i e water column u will alter the arrival times e g peak mean of the btc and d will affect the spread of peak λ and β will represent the immobile domain effects i e subsurface which manifests in the tail portion of the btc λ affects the onset concentration of the tail but it does not affect the slope a lower λ means that less mass is entering the subsurface and thus stays in the mobile region longer this would result in a lower onset concentration of the tail and subsequently a lower t since the mass will leave the immobile domain earlier the inverse of λ is the average amount of time a particle will spend in the surface before being exchanged with the subsurface lower β values will result in longer residence times in the immobile domain and produces heavier tails of the btc kmobile represents irreversible uptake in the water column kmobile will affect the peak concentration and the peak and mean arrival times it will also affect the onset concentration of the tail and its cutoff but not the onset time onset concentration or the slope of the tail increasing kmobile will result in a decreased btc peak concentration and early arrival times as less mass interacts with slower subsurface flows and the onset concentration and cutoff of the tail will be earlier than for a conservative tracer as a general qualitative representation kimmobile is the irreversible uptake in the subsurface kimmobile will not affect the peak concentration of its arrival time but it can affect the shape and length of the tail which will result in changes to the mean arrival time and t increasing kimmobile will result in steeper tail slopes with an early t and early mean arrival time 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the stream water and tio2 homoaggregation behavior the ph conductivity chl a and afdm of the stream were analyzed prior to each experiment table 1 tss and tds were measured once in june and in september there were only minimal differences in temperature ph conductivity and tds marked changes in tss chl a and afdm from june to september were observed due to seasonal biofilm growth i e fig 2 though specific distinctions were not made about the particulate components contributing to the tss because the stream conditions are constant from june to september the change in tss was presumably due to the addition of particulate organic matter from in stream biofilm growth the background concentration of ti was below the icp oes mdl for all samples the homoaggregation behavior of the tio2 nps in the stream water was assessed by analyzing the changes in hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential over approximately 1 hr fig 4 a in ultrapure water the initial 1 min hydrodynamic diameter of tio2 was approximately 261 5 5 nm and this was constant for 24 hrs 256 2 9 nm not shown in contrast the initial 1 min hydrodynamic diameter of tio2 in stream water was 648 45 nm which was significantly larger than the hydrodynamic diameter in ultrapure water p 0 05 throughout the experiment hydrodynamic diameter of tio2 increased and reached 865 17 nm after approximately 1 hr this marked increase compared to ultrapure water is attributed to the higher conductivity i e ionic strength of the stream water in either case though the addition of tio2 to water resulted in the aggregation of particles with a cluster size an order of magnitude greater than the average primary particle size 15 nm no significant differences p 0 05 were observed between filtered and unfiltered stream water not shown suggesting that any suspended organic or inorganic matter present in the stream did not affect the stability of the tio2 nps similarly no difference was observed between tio2 samples in ultrapure water analyzed after seconds of mixing compared to multiple hours of mixing not shown for tio2 dom in stream water the initial 1 min hydrodynamic size was 306 15 nm and this increased only slightly to 362 31 nm after approximately 1 hr the significant difference between the hydrodynamic diameters of tio2 and tio2 dom in the stream water p 0 05 suggests that the dom protects the tio2 nps from aggregation in high ionic strength waters the average zeta potentials of 18 8 0 53 and 16 1 1 8 mv ph 8 1 for tio2 and tio2 dom in stream water respectively were relatively steady over approximately 1 hr fig 4b dom can adsorb to the np surface and stabilize them against aggregation aiken et al 2011 jayalath et al 2018 stankus et al 2011 though the zeta potential difference between tio2 and tio2 dom was significant p 0 05 the small difference suggests that the enhanced stability caused by dom was due to steric hindrance rather than electrostatic repulsion from negatively charged functional groups 3 2 temporal moment analysis of btcs fig 5 a shows the btcs of tio2 and tio2 dom in the presence of minimal biofilms at the 25 m and 50 m sampling points log scale plots are also presented to visually resolve the tail portion of the btcs fig 5b fig s2 shows the equivalent btcs for the conservative tracer rwt the results of the temporal moment analyses of the btcs are provided in table 2 under minimal and thriving biofilm conditions the mass recovery of rwt at 25 m was approximately 94 and 100 respectively the recovery decreased to 87 as rwt moved downstream to the 50 m point this mass loss of the conservative tracer was presumably due to analytical detection limits and minor non conservative effects e g volume loss from stream sorption furthermore we only sampled the water column portion of the stream and while we assume the subsurface is immobile there will be some slow advection that manifests as apparent mass loss roche et al 2019a for all conditions tested the mass recovery of tio2 dom was higher than tio2 under minimal biofilm conditions the mass recovery of tio2 at 25 m was only 14 and nearly all the tio2 had been retained in the stream by 50 m biofilm growth in the stream during these experiments was negligible so the tio2 mass loss was attributed to its interaction with the porous streambed substrate the d50 size ratio np smallest media for tio2 and tio2 dom is 0 0015 and 0 00057 respectively which is much less than the requirement for mechanical filtration to occur in polydisperse granular media kerimov et al 2018 thus the major driving force for tio2 loss in the streambed was presumably attachment via electrostatic interactions while the time scale and detection limits of this study did not allow us to observe the resuspension of the nps previous results suggest that particles attached to biogeological media can be remobilized during high flow events that disturb the streambed cushing et al 1993 drummond et al 2014b newbold et al 2005 under minimal biofilm conditions co releasing dom with tio2 i e tio2 dom enhanced the transport of tio2 compared to experiments using only tio2 with mass recoveries at the 25 m and 50 m sampling points of 47 and 32 respectively the improved transport is presumably due to the adsorption of dom onto tio2 providing a repulsive or steric coating that minimizes the interaction with the stream substrates because dom and tio2 were simultaneously released to the stream without any pre mixing this suggests the adsorption process is fast relative to the stream velocity this hypothesis is supported by previous lab scale results describing the rapid adsorption of dom onto tio2 jayalath et al 2018 kim and doudrick 2019 the mean tm and peak tp arrival times of tio2 and tio2 dom were approximately the same e g tm 8 5 min at 50 m but there was considerably more mass recovered with tio2 dom with a percent change of 87 the delivery of nps to the streambed is controlled by advective hyporheic exchange and gravitational settling would be negligible because both tio2 and tio2 dom particles aggregates are 1000 μm fig 4 collectively these outcomes suggest that the presence of dom reduces the interaction of tio2 with streambed substrates but it does not alter the flow pathway of tio2 e g more transporting in the water column the transport experiments were repeated in september when biofilms were ubiquitous in the stream fig 2c with filamentous biofilms observed within water column and adhered to the streambed water interface the transport of tio2 was considerably reduced in the presence of thriving biofilm conditions with mass recoveries less than 3 observed fig 6 table 2 biofilms in the water column were visually inspected after the transport experiment and there were noticeable white patches on entrapped tio2 fig s3 small samples of biofilms were taken at five points in the stream 0 5 10 25 50 m and then analyzed for tio2 mass assuming the tio2 loading in the biofilm samples was homogeneous and representative of all biofilms at each sampling point most of the tio2 mass loss 95 fig s4 occurred in the first 5 m of the stream with nearly 85 of the total tio2 measured being captured near the tio2 sample injection point i e 0 to 0 5 m this outcome suggests that the mass loss of tio2 due to biofilms is rapid compared to the stream velocity the mass recovery for tio2 dom at 25 m and 50 m 43 and 36 in the presence of thriving biofilms was higher than tio2 2 2 and 0 5 furthermore the mass recovery for tio2 dom under thriving biofilm conditions was not markedly different compared to minimal biofilms conditions 5 difference the mean arrival time for tio2 dom 19 1 min at 50 m was greater than tio2 15 2 m at 50 m in the presence of thriving biofilms this observation contrasted with the similar arrival times observed under minimal biofilms conditions thus the presence of biofilms considerably increases the mass loss of tio2 nps whereas in the presence of dom the biofilms retard the transport of tio2 without irreversibly trapping it 3 4 modeling the transport of tio2 nps in streams the best fit model parameters were obtained from the rwt btcs for minimal and thriving biofilm conditions table 3 the accompanying experimental and modeled btcs for rwt are shown in fig 7 the model was suitable for the early peak tail and truncation time portions of the rwt btcs which highlights its ability to capture a range of spatio temporal phases the presence of thriving biofilms altered the hydrodynamic transport parameters the water column velocity u decreased approximately 25 and the dispersivity d increased approximately 50 which indicates increased mixing in the stream the hyporheic exchange rate λ increased approximately 30 indicating a higher probability of nps being carried by the stream water into the streambed the power law exponent β decreased approximately 10 indicating that nps spent an increased time in the streambed before moving back into the water column this would increase the chances of interaction with the streambed media the parameter values from the 25 m and 50 m sampling points were in relative agreement table s1 but some notable differences were observed e g u for thriving one of the key assumptions of the model is that the stream is well mixed and hydraulically identical throughout the reach but the observed differences suggest some heterogeneity exists overall the transport parameters were quantitatively similar to previous conservative tracer studies conducted in the same stream at nd leef roche et al 2019a aubeneau et al 2016 fig 7 shows the experimental and modeled btcs for tio2 and tio2 dom under minimal and thriving biofilm conditions at the 25 m and 50 m sampling points no model fit was obtained for tio2 at 50 m under thriving biofilm conditions because data was only obtained at three data points due to the large mass loss under minimal biofilm conditions fig 7a and b relatively good model fits were obtained which attests to the model s ability to capture a broad range of transport processes e g aggregation physical retention chemical sorption under thriving biofilm conditions fig 7c and d the predictive capability of the model was reduced there are two explanations for the diminished capability of the model under thriving biofilm conditions the first reason is related to the attachment behavior of the nps to biofilms the model assumes the mass removal process is irreversible at a first order rate described by the k parameters if the interaction between the biofilms and the nps is a reversible attachment detachment process then this would be reflected in an equally re scaled u and d i e u and d are less than what is predicted by the rwt data which is a surrogate for a retardation factor the model predicted earlier arrival times than the experimental data which is influenced by u and d thus re scaling u and d equally would increase the predicted arrival time and more closely matching the experimental data this speculation is supported by the moment analysis outcomes fig 3 the mean arrival times for tio2 and tio2 dom were similar under minimal biofilm conditions but different under thriving conditions which suggests differing retardation factors could be playing a role for the differing surface chemistries of the two tio2 nps the second reason is related to the model determination of the k values during model optimization of the k values the sse continued to decrease until a maximum or minimum k value was reached i e 10 8 however there was a limiting point where decreasing the k by an order of magnitude minimized the sse but did not improve the model fit e g fig s5 for kmobile inaccurate k values would incorrectly predict the mass removed resulting in btcs that are shifted below or above the experimental data e g fig 7d to account for the issues with the model for thriving biofilm conditions u and d were scaled equally and then kmobile and kimmobile parameters were adjusted to obtain a better fit by manually minimizing the sse the λ β t parameters were not adjusted for example for tio2 dom at 50 m under thriving biofilm conditions the shape of the modeled btc fig 7d was too wide with a shallow tail slope and predicted concentrations that were too low and early this means the model was overestimating u and d and both kmobile and kimmobile predictions had convergence errors to account for this u and d were first de scaled equally to account for reversible attachment processes and then the k parameters were optimized kmobile decreased and kimmobile increased thus reducing the mass loss in the water column but increasing the mass loss in the streambed respectively the parameter results for minimal and thriving biofilm conditions are shown in table 4 and the adjusted btcs are shown in fig 8 also listed in table 4 is the kmobile kimmobile ratio which provides some insight into where the mass loss of tio2 occurred in the stream the k ratio for minimal and thriving biofilm conditions was greater for tio2 compared to tio2 dom suggesting greater mass loss in the mobile domain this model outcome agreed with the larger mass loss observed for tio2 table 2 for tio2 the presence of thriving biofilm conditions resulted in a higher k ratio compared to minimal biofilm conditions the increased kmobile was presumably due to mass loss to biofilms present in the water column fig 2c for tio2 dom the k ratio was similar for both biofilm conditions which agrees with experimental results table 2 that indicated the influence of biofilms on the mass recovery of tio2 dom was minimal the modeled parameters reiterate the ability of dom to reduce interactions of tio2 with biofilms and the streambed substrate as a demonstration of the usefulness of the model and implications of the findings the distance the tio2 nps must travel in the stream to reach a desired percent mass retention was determined table 4 fig 9 for example 99 9 of tio2 nps would be removed from the water column and retained in the streambed after traveling approximately 90 m and 50 m for minimal and thriving biofilm conditions respectively and the presence of dom more than doubles the distance the nps will travel 4 conclusion the transport of nps in streams is heavily influenced by the presence of biofilms and dom when biofilms are present in streams they can immobilize nps resulting in diminished downstream transport this may be exacerbated by the homoaggregation of nps in streams especially those with high ionic strength the presence of dom stabilizes nps against homoaggregation and mitigates the impact of biofilms thus enhancing transport whereas tio2 nps are presumably immobilized in the biofilms the presence of dom causes biofilm np interactions to be reversible these conclusions should be confirmed by extensive lab scale studies when dom interacts with tio2 nps it adsorbs to and covers the surface of the np thus changes the surface identity of the np kim and doudrick 2019 louie et al 2016 2013 so though the results presented herein are specific for tio2 the transport of other nps will presumably be similar when dom concentrations are high enough that they coat the surface of the np collectively these findings have significant implications for real world transport of tio2 for example tio2 nps that are present in wastewater effluent will likely be covered with organic macromolecules that stabilize them from aggregation and reduce

15356,planted filters are often used to remove pesticides from runoff water however the detailed fate of pesticides in the planted filters still remains elusive this hampers an accurate assessment of environmental risks of the pesticides related to their fate and thereby development of proper mitigation strategies in addition a test system for the chemical fate analysis including plants and in particular for planted filters is not well established yet therefore we developed a microcosm test to simulate the fate of pesticide in planted filters and applied 2 13c 15n glyphosate as a model pesticide the fate of 2 13c 15n glyphosate in the planted microcosms over 31 day incubation period was balanced and compared with that in the unplanted microcosms the mass balance of 2 13c 15n glyphosate turnover included 13c mineralization degradation products and the 13c and 15n incorporation into the rhizosphere microbial biomass and plants we observed high removal of glyphosate 88 from the water mainly due to adsorption on gravel in both microcosms more glyphosate was degraded in the planted microcosms with 4 1 of 13c being mineralized 1 5 of 13c and 3 8 of 15n being incorporated into microbial biomass in the unplanted microcosms 1 1 of 13c from 2 13c 15n glyphosate was mineralized and only 0 2 of 13c and 0 1 of 15n were assimilated into microbial biomass the total recovery of 13c and 15n was 81 and 85 in planted microcosms and 91 and 93 in unplanted counterparts respectively the microcosm test was thus proven to be feasible for mass balance assessments of the fate of non volatile chemicals in planted filters the results of such studies could help better manage and design planted filters for pesticide removal graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords planted filter fate mass balance pesticide microbial degradation adsorption data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction pesticides in agricultural and urban areas are often carried by runoff water to surface waters which are the habitats of aquatic biota and drinking water supplies for humans pesticides can be toxic to aquatic biota morrissey et al 2015 stenstrom et al 2021 and human beings mostafalou and abdollahi 2017 in order to protect aquatic ecosystems and drinking water resources planted filters like constructed wetlands vegetated ditches and riparian buffer strips are often used to remove pesticides from runoff water syversen and bechmann 2004 vymazal and bfezinova 2015 pesticides can be removed by planted filters via sorption on filter matrices bio degradation and plant uptake and phytotransformation pesticides sorbed on matrices can still be released to waters thus posing delayed environmental and toxicological risks maillard and imfeld 2014 pesticides may also be completely removed from water through bio degradation processes by mineralization and incorporation of elements into microbial biomass resulting in detoxification of the pesticides kästner et al 2014 nevertheless during the degradation of pesticides toxic and persistent degradation products may also be formed moreover an enhanced uptake of pesticides by plants can improve the removal efficiency of pesticides from water however the comprehensive fate of pesticides in planted filters is elusive which prevents predicting environmental risks associated with the pesticide fate and developing planted filters optimized for pesticide removal laboratory microcosm experiments are usually conducted to simulate the fate of chemicals in the environment oecd 2002a 2002b 2004 although pesticide fate has been widely determined in different environmental matrices such as soil and water sediment with stable or radioactive isotope labeled pesticide nowak et al 2018 shrestha et al 2016 wang et al 2016 fate analyses in the presence of plants are rare and there is no generally accepted test which includes plants previous studies of chemical fate with plants usually applied complex air flow through setup and could not elucidate the detailed microbial degradation processes of the applied 14c labeled chemicals hand et al 2020 sun et al 2014 plants can influence the fate of pesticide in the environmental matrices via uptake and the formed rhizosphere conditions plants diffuse oxygen into the matrices changing the redox conditions they consume nutrients such as no3 in the matrices and also release root exudates which provide carbon sources for microorganisms jones et al 2009 we thus hypothesized that the degradation rate and the microbial metabolism of pesticide as a carbon and nitrogen source are different in planted matrices compared to that in the unplanted counterparts therefore the overall aim of this study was to develop a microcosm test for detailed fate assessment of isotope labeled pesticides in planted filters reed canary grass phalaris arundinacea was planted due to its frequent application in planted filters vymazal 2013 and the prominent development of roots vymazal and kröpfelová 2008 which might favor degradation of pesticides in the filter gravel was employed as the substrate for the microcosms because of its common use 13c and 15n co labeled glyphosate n phosphonomethyl glycine was selected as a model pesticide because of the following three reasons firstly glyphosate is one of the most applied pesticide worldwide and can be carried away from the application site by runoff water lupi et al 2019 maggi et al 2020 which is one important reason for its frequent detection in surface waters worldwide carles et al 2019 geng et al 2021 okada et al 2020 secondly the degradation pattern of glyphosate is well known zhan et al 2018 which allows to track the detailed fate of the pesticide and thus facilitates studying the influence of rhizosphere thirdly although high removal of glyphosate by planted filters was reported the detailed fate processes contributing to the removal are still unexplored imfeld et al 2013 lópez chávez et al 2021 the specific objective of the study was to establish the comprehensive mass balance of 2 13c 15n glyphosate fate which included quantifying the isotope labels in i mineralization ii degradation products iii incorporation of 13c and 15n into microbial biomass amino acids in the rhizosphere and iv plant biomass roots and shoots in addition we also investigated the label distribution in different compartments pore water gravel plants and microbial pellets from rhizosphere of the microcosms the obtained results in planted microcosms were compared with that in unplanted microcosms 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals 2 13c 15n glyphosate 99 atom 13c 98 atom 15n and unlabeled glyphosate 99 purity were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis usa and used for the incubation experiment ampa and sarcosine purity 98 were both obtained from sigma aldrich and glycine j t baker was obtained from avantor deventer netherland all other chemicals were of analytical

quartz 6 8 mm weco gmbh co kg leer germany for ornamental use was purchased from a local market leipzig germany the gravel was sieved to remove the fine particles 4 mm the iron and aluminum from amorphous metal oxides in gravel were extracted with ammonium oxalate solution according to the method of schwertmann 1964 and determined with inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes arcos spectro gmbh kleve germany the amorphous iron content was 150 mg kg and the amorphous aluminum content was 26 mg kg the organic matter content measured by loss on ignition at 450 c was 0 2 w w the ph was 4 5 h2o and 4 3 0 01 m cacl2 2 3 setup of the microcosms and incubation with glyphosate five different treatments were prepared 1 planted microcosm with 2 13c 15n glyphosate planted labeled test 2 planted microcosm with unlabeled glyphosate unlabeled control 3 planted microcosm without glyphosate blank control 4 unplanted microcosm with 2 13c 15n glyphosate unplanted control 5 unplanted microcosm with unlabeled glyphosate unplanted unlabeled control the amount of 13c and 15n calculated based on total c or n concentration and the ratio of the heavy isotope to the light one as at in the labeled treatments 1 and 4 was corrected for the natural abundance of these isotopes by subtracting the amount of 13c or 15n in the corresponding treatments with unlabeled glyphosate 2 and 5 the blank control 3 provided the information about the potential inhibitive effect of glyphosate on plant growth all treatments consisted of three replicates the microcosms were set up in 1 l glass jars the jar was sealed with a glass lid with a rubber sealing ring 1000 g of gravel was placed in each microcosm the setup of planted microcosms is illustrated in fig 1 a the lid was perforated with six holes of 1 cm diameter allowing plants to grow through as well as watering and sampling fig 1b three to four seedlings of reed canary grass stem height around 20 cm were planted in the microcosms and grew with 2 g l fertilizer hakaphos soft spezial which was replenished every week for two months before the application of glyphosate one week before glyphosate application the rhizosphere part was sealed for plant adaption by closing the holes on the lid the holes for plants were first filled with soft clay and finally sealed with silicone rubber sealant tfc silicone rubber type 1 troll factory riede germany the other holes were closed by rubber stoppers for trapping 13co2 and 12co2 a 25 ml glass vessel for naoh solution was placed in the rhizosphere part the vessel was held in position by a stainless steel wire mounted to a rubber stopper sampling and replacement of naoh solution could be conducted by a syringe through the cannula installed in the rubber stopper when not in use the cannula was closed with a luer lock b braun melsungen germany for the unplanted microcosms the lids of the jars did not contain any holes the unplanted microcosms were fertilized with 2 g l hakaphos soft spezial twice 1st directly after preparation of the microcosms 2nd one week before glyphosate application the glass vessels for naoh solution were mounted inside the microcosms the lids were opened during sampling and replacement of naoh solution for the short time needed for the procedure the outer walls of all the microcosm jars were covered with aluminum foil to minimize algae growth all the microcosms were placed in a greenhouse with controlled conditions and located at helmholtz centre for environmental research ufz leipzig germany the temperature was kept at 22 c from 6 am to 9 pm and at 16 c at night thus providing standard conditions allowing for optimal plant growth light produced from master son pia lamps 400 w phillips belgium was supplied when the illuminance by natural light fell below 60 klx after around two months when the stem height of the plants reached around 30 40 cm water was removed from all the microcosms by evapotranspiration for the planted microcosms or by decanting for the unplanted microcosms thereafter 200 ml of 20 mg l glyphosate solution unlabeled or 2 13c 15n co labeled in tap water or only tap water blank control was loaded into the microcosms the applied concentration of glyphosate was much higher than that found in the runoff water or surface waters ranged from several to hundreds of μg l geng et al 2021 lefrancq et al 2017 however such high amount of glyphosate was needed to ensure isotopic enrichment in the samples not being masked by the natural abundances of 13c and 15n previous study by wang et al 2016 showed that the mineralization rate of glyphosate at high concentration 50 mg l in water sediment was a bit slower than that at low concentration of 3 mg l but the ultimate cumulative mineralization at the two concentrations was the same about 60 of the initially added 13c at the end 80 days the resulting water level in each microcosm was around 1 cm below the top of the gravel naoh solution 2 m 10 ml was added to the glass vessels the last supply of nutrients to all microcosms was one week before dosing glyphosate during the incubation period the planted microcosms were supplemented only with tap water every two days to compensate for water loss by plant transpiration and to maintain the water level water was not supplemented for the unplanted microcosms due to insignificant loss all microcosms were incubated for 31 days 2 4 sampling and analysis 2 4 1 sampling procedure during the incubation period naoh solution with co2 13co2 trapped was sampled and replaced every four days for the unplanted microcosms and every two days for the planted microcosms due to the high respiration of rhizosphere three water samples of around 300 µl were taken from the microcosms to determine the concentrations of glyphosate and its degradation products ampa sarcosine and glycine on days 0 5 13 22 and 31 after 31 days when the incubation was terminated the microcosms were opened plants were retrieved by carefully separating the roots from gravel they were then divided into shoots and roots and the fresh weights were recorded the roots and shoots were thereafter lyophilized and ground to powder with a mixer mill mm2000 retsch haan germany prior to further analysis the pore water was withdrawn after manually shaking the gravel and pore water for a few minutes the suspended microbial biomass in the pore water was collected by centrifugation 5000 g 20 min 4 c and retrieving the pellets biofilms attached to plant roots and gravel were extracted

extraction was conducted twice consecutively the obtained extracts were then centrifuged and the pellets were collected after removing the supernatants all harvested microbial biomass pellets were lyophilized for further analysis and the dry weights were recorded 2 4 2 mineralization analysis 13co2 from the mineralization of 13c in 2 13c 15n glyphosate was quantified based on the amount of total inorganic carbon tic trapped into the naoh solution and the 13c 12c isotope ratio at 13c 12c of co2 released by addition of phosphoric acid 85 in an airtight headspace vial girardi et al 2013

5000 g 20 min 4 c adsorption on gravel glyphosate and ampa adsorbed on gravel were extracted with 400 ml of 0 3 m naoh solution by shaking 300 rpm 1 h 25 c after removing the biofilm on gravel by pbs solution the extraction was conducted three times consecutively the extracts were combined and diluted with milliq h2o in an appropriate amount to have concentrations of glyphosate and ampa in the calibration range of 0 05 50 µg l for quantification plants to extract glyphosate and ampa from the plant material 80 mg of shoot or 25 mg of root was mixed with 10 ml of h2o dcm 1 1 v v before the extraction the plant material was spiked with 50 µl of 10 mg l 13c3 15n glyphosate and 13c15n ampa in milliq water as internal standards to correct for the extraction efficiency and matrix effect the extraction was conducted by vortexing for 1 h and subsequently sonicating 35 khz bandelin sonorex tk 52 berlin germany for 20 min the mixtures were then centrifuged 10 000 g 20 min 4 c the supernatant from the upper water phase 500 µl was withdrawn and diluted to a final volume of 1 ml with milliq h2o prior to the quantification of glyphosate and ampa the analyses of glyphosate ampa sarcosine and glycine were described in detail in text s1 briefly they were analyzed by lc ms ms after derivatization with fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl chloride fmoc cl muskus et al 2019 sun et al 2019 the lc ms ms comprised a 1260 infinity ii lc system agilent santa clara usa coupled to a qtrap 6500 ms ab sciex darmstadt germany with an electrospray ionization esi source a zorbax extend c18 column 2 1 100 mm 3 5 µm particle size narrow bore rr agilent us was used to separate the analytes glyphosate and ampa were separated with a gradient of 5 mm ammonium acetate ph 9 and methanol as mobile phases and detected in negative ion mode sarcosine and glycine were separated with a gradient of 5 mm acetic acid ammonium acetate and acetonitrile as mobile phases and detected in positive ion mode the limits of quantification loq were 0 04 µg l for glyphosate and 0 12 µg l for ampa 0 64 µg l for sarcosine and 0 69 µg l for glycine 2 4 4 analysis of amino acids aas aas were hydrolyzed from the proteins of microbial biomass pellets collected from the endpoint pore water pbs extracts of gravel and root biofilm with 6 m hcl at 110 c for 22 h according to the method of nowak et al 2011 the obtained hydrolysates were then passed through a glass microfiber filter 0 7 µm puradisc 25 gf f whatman buckinghamshire uk and dried under n2 prior to derivatization the details of derivatization and subsequent purification were described previously nowak et al 2011 finally the samples were dissolved in hexane with 20 ethyl acetate for further analysis the amounts of 13c and 15n incorporated into the aas were calculated based on the amount of individual aa measured by gc ms and their corresponding isotopic composition 13c 12c and 15n 14n determined by gc c irms the detailed instrumental methods are listed in text s3 2 4 5 analysis by elemental analyzer the total amounts of c and n and the corresponding isotope ratios of c 13c 12c and n 15n 14n in the microbial pellets plants and the endpoint pore water were analyzed with elemental analyzer ea irms ea flash 2000 thermo conflo iv thermo delta v advantage irms thermo bremen germany all calibration curves for c and n concentrations exhibited r2 0 99 2 5 mass balance and data analysis the amounts of 13c and 15n were determined in different compartments of the microcosms pore water gravel plants naoh trapping solution and pellets collected from the endpoint pore water gravel biofilm and root biofilm the recovered amounts of 13c and 15n in each compartment are presented as the percentages of the initially applied amount of 2 13c 15n glyphosate the mass balance of 13c and 15n was calculated by the sum of the percentages the measured amounts of 13c and 15n in the aas were used to represent the labeled microbial proteins since protein accounts for around 55 of the dry weight of microbial cells madigan 2015 a conversion factor of 1 8 was used to estimate the total amounts of 13c and 15n from 2 13c 15n glyphosate incorporated into the microbial biomass all data are presented as average value standard deviation of three replicates the difference between the planted microcosms and the unplanted microcosms was compared by using unpaired t test and was considered significant if p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 glyphosate and its degradation products 3 1 1 concentrations in the pore water the concentrations of glyphosate ampa glycine and sarcosine in the pore water were monitored over the incubation period to check the dissipation of glyphosate and the detection of degradation products the concentrations of glyphosate in the pore water dropped rapidly within several hours to 9 2 1 2 mg l in the planted and to 4 8 0 3 mg l in the unplanted microcosms after glyphosate application fig 2 such a rapid dissipation of glyphosate from the pore water implied that sorption occurred in the microcosms the glyphosate concentration then decreased slowly from day 5 onwards ampa was already detected on day 5 at 21 5 μg l in the planted and at 12 1 μg l in the unplanted microcosms then the concentration of ampa increased to a maximum of 40 20 μg l on day 22 in the planted microcosms and remained almost stable thereafter the concentration of ampa in the unplanted microcosms reached a maximum of 15 4 μg l on day 13 and afterwards decreased slightly until the end we did not detect glycine and sarcosine on any sampling date both sarcosine and glycine produced from glyphosate degradation in the microcosms may have been utilized very fast by the microorganisms noteworthy is that the concentrations of ampa were two orders of magnitude lower than those of glyphosate comparing with the initially applied concentration of glyphosate 20 mg l relatively low concentrations of glyphosate 1 mg l and ampa maximum 40 µg l were detected in the pore water after 31 days indicating high removal of glyphosate from the water in both microcosms the concentrations of glyphosate in the unplanted were always lower p 0 05 at each sampling date than in the planted microcosms this thus suggests that the unplanted microcosms exhibited higher removal of glyphosate from the water than the planted microcosms however higher p 0 05 concentrations of ampa were detected on day 31 in the planted 39 16 μg l than in the unplanted microcosms 6 6 μg l after terminating the incubation 10 9 2 2 of the initial amount of glyphosate was found in the planted pore water and ampa accounted for 0 4 0 2 of the initial amount of glyphosate in the unplanted microcosms glyphosate accounted for 1 8 1 1 and ampa for 0 1 0 03 high removal of glyphosate from water was also observed by lópez chávez et al 2021 in their study more than 98 of the initially applied glyphosate was dissipated during water passage through both planted and unplanted wetlands after 47 days however the removal of glyphosate from the planted pore water in this study around 89 was lower than that in their study the high removal in their unplanted wetlands was mainly due to sorption of the glyphosate on the gravel while that in their planted wetlands was attributed to both sorption and degradation of the glyphosate 3 1 2 adsorption on gravel the adsorption capacity of glyphosate ampa glycine and sarcosine on the gravel was studied in an independent batch experiment details in text s4 and the result was presented in fig s1 it showed that more than 85 of the initially applied amount of glyphosate and ampa was adsorbed on the gravel within 2 h and the adsorption increased to 98 after 24 h the adsorption of glycine and sarcosine on the gravel was less than 20 after terminating the incubation of the microcosms the glyphosate and ampa adsorbed on gravel were released by both pbs solution and naoh solution table s3 glyphosate and ampa were desorbed into the pbs solution due to the competition of phosphate in pbs with the phosphonate group of glyphosate and ampa for sorption sites on gravel lópez chávez et al 2021 pereira et al 2019 in total the glyphosate adsorbed on gravel accounted for 59 5 6 5 of the initially added glyphosate in the planted microcosms and for 86 4 1 2 in the unplanted microcosms thus the adsorption of glyphosate on gravel was the main fate of glyphosate in the microcosms in addition the adsorption was lower p 0 05 in the planted microcosms than in the unplanted counterparts therefore higher removal of glyphosate from the pore water was observed in the unplanted microcosms in section 3 1 1 the high adsorption of glyphosate on gravel was also observed in other studies lópez chávez et al 2021 strange hansen et al 2004 the adsorption of glyphosate was associated with the contents of iron and aluminum oxides of the solid matrices piccolo et al 1994 the iron and aluminum oxides are prone to form inner sphere complexes with the phosphonate group of glyphosate as the distance of the oh groups of the phosphonate group matches well with the lattice geometry of the oxides sheals et al 2002 in addition iron and aluminum oxides have high point of zero charge phpzc above 7 0 pereira et al 2019 at ph phpzc they are positively charged and thus can sorb the negatively charged glyphosate present at common environmental ph conditions hence the adsorption of glyphosate on gravel is also associated with ph although the amorphous iron and aluminum contents in the gravel 150 mg fe kg and 26 mg al kg of this study were lower than those of the gravel 202 mg fe kg and 49 mg al kg studied by albers et al 2020 the adsorption of glyphosate on the gravel in this study was higher this divergence might be due to the lower ph of the gravel in this study 4 5 than those in the study of albers 8 4 and 9 0 at low ph the iron and aluminum oxides are more positively charged and thus can sorb the negatively charged glyphosate stronger and with a higher capacity the lower adsorption of glyphosate on the planted gravel than on the unplanted gravel can be attributed to the following four explanations 1 the dense biofilms developed on the planted gravel sheltered the adsorption sites of glyphosate the extracted biomass from the gravel biofilm was more than 10 fold higher in the planted microcosms 31 5 4 8 mg than that in the unplanted counterparts 2 5 0 4 mg 2 the higher amount of phosphorus in the planted microcosms occupied some sorption sites for glyphosate table s4 phosphate was found to compete for sorption sites of glyphosate in soils or minerals borggaard and gimsing 2008 gimsing et al 2004 the sorption capacity for glyphosate thus can be reduced by prior application of phosphate munira et al 2018 in this study prior to glyphosate application nutrient containing phosphate was supplied more often to the planted microcosms for supporting plant growth than to the unplanted microcosms section 2 3 although the plants utilized substantial part of the added phosphate there could be still some phosphate adsorbed on gravel hampering the adsorption of glyphosate 3 root exudates or their mediated microbial activity liberated the adsorbed glyphosate li et al 2021 root exudates were not analyzed in this study instead the doc concentration in the pore water was measured which was higher in the planted microcosms 14 2 2 3 mg l than in the unplanted microcosms 7 9 0 8 mg l suggesting root exudates were present besides the higher amount of microbial biomass collected from the planted microcosms also indicated the contribution of root exudates 4 more metal oxides in gravel were presumably reduced in the planted microcosms than in the unplanted counterparts therefore the sorption of glyphosate in the planted microcosms decreased a black color presumably caused by precipitation of metal sulfides under anoxic conditions janssen et al 1997 was observed at the greater depth of the planted gravel fig s2 but not in the unplanted microcosms which suggests the planted microcosms were more anoxic in summary both the rhizosphere condition and nutrient application for plant development may have influenced the sorption of glyphosate on gravel in the planted microcosms but we cannot decide which factor contributed most in this study 3 2 mineralization of glyphosate the release of 13co2 from 2 13c 15n glyphosate was measured over the 31 day incubation period the detected 13co2 in the microcosms increased slowly from day 0 without a lag phase fig 3 the ultimate cumulative mineralization of 13c from 2 13c 15n glyphosate accounted for 4 1 of the initially added 13c in the planted microcosms and 1 1 in the unplanted microcosms the higher mineralization of 2 13c 15n glyphosate in the planted microcosms than in the unplanted microcosms could be attributed to the higher amount of doc in the planted microcosms table s4 which could have promoted the activity of microbial degraders the mineralization of glyphosate was relatively low in the microcosms compared with that in soil and water sediment reported by others muskus et al 2019 sun et al 2019 wang et al 2016 mineralization of glyphosate was found to be negatively correlated to its adsorption by soil zablotowicz et al 2009 however higher adsorption of glyphosate on soil than on gravel was reported albers et al 2020 strange hansen et al 2004 moreover although the adsorption capacity of gravel in this study is lower than that reported by strange hansen et al 2004 the mineralization of glyphosate in this study was much lower than that in strange hansen study with comparable concentration of glyphosate 17 mg l in their study applied therefore the low mineralization of glyphosate in this study cannot be attributed only to its high adsorption on the gravel the microbial activities and microcosm conditions may also have influenced the mineralization of glyphosate stenrod et al 2006 von wirén lehr et al 1997 several studies have shown that glyphosate is less degraded in oxygen limited soil microcosms kanissery et al 2015 la cecilia and maggi 2018 as the microcosms in this study were water saturated we assume that the oxygen level was low at least at greater depths although plants can transport oxygen into the microcosms the planted microcosms are still believed to be oxygen deficient the evidence for this is the black color at the greater depth of the gravel fig s2 as discussed in section 3 1 2 3 3 incorporation of elements into microbial biomass the 13c and 15n derived from 2 13c 15n glyphosate in aas were used to quantify the label incorporation into the microbial biomass 1 5 0 9 of the initially applied 13c and 3 8 1 7 of the initially applied 15n considering the conversion factor 1 8 see section 2 5 were incorporated into the microbial biomass collected from the planted microcosms however the isotope assimilation into the biomass was much lower in the unplanted microcosms 0 2 0 08 of the initially applied 13c and 0 1 0 01 of the initially applied 15n although these percentage values are very low the 13c and 15n isotope enrichments of aas were significant as compared to the unlabeled control natural abundance the incorporation of 13c and 15n into the microbial biomass indicated that 2 13c 15n glyphosate degraded through sarcosine glycine pathways apart from ampa pathways fig 4 glycine was most abundant in 13c and 15n according to the labeling patterns of individual aa fig 5 the 13c15n glycine could be either the direct product of glycine pathway or yielded from the degradation of 13c15n sarcosine both pathways are energetically favorable brock et al 2019 the produced glycine can be directly incorporated into the microbial proteins as a monomeric building block which also saves energy for microorganisms during anabolism nelson et al 2017 noteworthy is that the amount of 15n labeled glutamate was much lower than 15n glycine in the unplanted microcosms fig 5d while the 15n labeled glutamate had similar amount to 15n glycine in the planted microcosms fig 5b this indicates deamination of 15n glutamate could have happened in the unplanted microcosms the higher amount of inorganic n in the unplanted microcosms than that in planted microcosms could have led to deamination of aas to excrete the overloaded 15n from sarcosine glycine degradation pathway the possible inorganic 15n is unlikely to derive from 15n ampa degradation because the degradation of ampa can be inhibited by the low c n ratios in the microcosms doc tn ratio in the endpoint pore water was 8 27 2 83 in the planted microcosms and was 0 04 0 003 in the unplanted counterparts see table s4 brock et al 2019 3 4 uptake by plants glyphosate did not influence the biomass of plants which was comparable in microcosms with and without glyphosate table s5 a small portion of 13c 1 3 of the initially added 2 13c 15n glyphosate was only found in the roots table s6 with ea analysis while 15n was found both in shoots and roots and accounted for 2 2 in total however 2 13c 15n glyphosate was detected also in shoots with lc ms ms analysis it suggests that a small amount of 13c was also incorporated into the shoots but it was not detectable due to the high carbon content of shoots the glyphosate in plants shoots roots accounted for 0 4 0 3 of the initially added glyphosate whereas ampa for 0 02 0 01 the amounts of 2 13c 15n glyphosate and 15n ampa in plants were three to five times lower than the total amounts of 13c and 15n in plants the possible reasons can be that i glyphosate and ampa in plants were mostly transformed ii more degradation products of glyphosate were transported into plants than glyphosate itself and iii glyphosate or ampa formed phase ii conjugates or underwent phase iii compartmentation in plants which masked their presence and detection in plants van eerd et al 2003 3 5 mass balance of 13c and 15n from 2 13c 15n glyphosate in the microcosms the 13c and 15n mass balances from 2 13c 15n glyphosate in the microcosms are shown in fig 6 a d the recovery of 13c and 15n was 80 5 8 5 and 84 8 4 5 in the planted microcosms and 90 7 0 5 and 93 1 0 4 in the unplanted microcosms the recovery of 13c and 15n was thus lower in the planted microcosms than that in the unplanted counterparts the lower recovery of 13c presumably resulted from the loss of 13co2 by plant aerenchyma grundmann et al 2008 the lost 13co2 could result from the degradation of 2 13c 15n glyphosate or its degradation products in plants the lower recovery of 15n could be ascribed to the loss of 15n2 which could result from inorganic 15n reduction under anaerobic conditions in the planted microcosms in both microcosms 13c and 15n was dominantly adsorbed on gravel as 2 13c 15n glyphosate and in particular in the unplanted microcosms 86 of the initially added isotope in the planted pore water 15n was attributed to 2 13c 15n glyphosate and 15n ampa fig 6e in the unplanted pore water around 12 3 of 15n could not be identified fig 6f and it was most likely inorganic 15n 15nh4 or 15no3 derived from the deamination of the 15n aas section 3 3 4 conclusions and outlook with the microcosm test we established the mass balance of the model pesticide glyphosate fate in planted and unplanted water gravel microcosms and achieved good recovery of the pesticide the comprehensive fate of the pesticide in the rhizosphere was elucidated by including sorption on substrate mineralization degradation products and incorporation of elements into microbial biomass and compared with that in unplanted microcosms plants influenced the microbial utilization of the pesticide as a carbon and nitrogen source as revealed by 13c 15n colabeling approach although the degradation of the pesticide was promoted in the planted microcosms the adsorption on the gravel as the dominant fate was lower than that in unplanted microcosms leading to higher amount of the pesticide detected in the planted pore water in this case strategies such as increasing the hydraulic retention time of water are needed to increase degradation of the pesticide in planted filters for meeting the requirement of water quality for effluent the fate of chemicals under the influence of plants is largely unknown especially in planted filters this microcosm set up could serve as a reference for such studies but establishing mass balance of the chemical fate is only possible for non volatile compounds the advantage of this microcosm set up is the simplicity and that it can be used for other substrates to be applied in wetlands or for agricultural soils furthermore the influence of plants on chemical fate applying microcosm set up under controlled laboratory conditions is not considered yet in regulatory testing of chemicals e g reach regulation therefore this microcosm test also could be developed as a future standardized oecd

15356,planted filters are often used to remove pesticides from runoff water however the detailed fate of pesticides in the planted filters still remains elusive this hampers an accurate assessment of environmental risks of the pesticides related to their fate and thereby development of proper mitigation strategies in addition a test system for the chemical fate analysis including plants and in particular for planted filters is not well established yet therefore we developed a microcosm test to simulate the fate of pesticide in planted filters and applied 2 13c 15n glyphosate as a model pesticide the fate of 2 13c 15n glyphosate in the planted microcosms over 31 day incubation period was balanced and compared with that in the unplanted microcosms the mass balance of 2 13c 15n glyphosate turnover included 13c mineralization degradation products and the 13c and 15n incorporation into the rhizosphere microbial biomass and plants we observed high removal of glyphosate 88 from the water mainly due to adsorption on gravel in both microcosms more glyphosate was degraded in the planted microcosms with 4 1 of 13c being mineralized 1 5 of 13c and 3 8 of 15n being incorporated into microbial biomass in the unplanted microcosms 1 1 of 13c from 2 13c 15n glyphosate was mineralized and only 0 2 of 13c and 0 1 of 15n were assimilated into microbial biomass the total recovery of 13c and 15n was 81 and 85 in planted microcosms and 91 and 93 in unplanted counterparts respectively the microcosm test was thus proven to be feasible for mass balance assessments of the fate of non volatile chemicals in planted filters the results of such studies could help better manage and design planted filters for pesticide removal graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords planted filter fate mass balance pesticide microbial degradation adsorption data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction pesticides in agricultural and urban areas are often carried by runoff water to surface waters which are the habitats of aquatic biota and drinking water supplies for humans pesticides can be toxic to aquatic biota morrissey et al 2015 stenstrom et al 2021 and human beings mostafalou and abdollahi 2017 in order to protect aquatic ecosystems and drinking water resources planted filters like constructed wetlands vegetated ditches and riparian buffer strips are often used to remove pesticides from runoff water syversen and bechmann 2004 vymazal and bfezinova 2015 pesticides can be removed by planted filters via sorption on filter matrices bio degradation and plant uptake and phytotransformation pesticides sorbed on matrices can still be released to waters thus posing delayed environmental and toxicological risks maillard and imfeld 2014 pesticides may also be completely removed from water through bio degradation processes by mineralization and incorporation of elements into microbial biomass resulting in detoxification of the pesticides kästner et al 2014 nevertheless during the degradation of pesticides toxic and persistent degradation products may also be formed moreover an enhanced uptake of pesticides by plants can improve the removal efficiency of pesticides from water however the comprehensive fate of pesticides in planted filters is elusive which prevents predicting environmental risks associated with the pesticide fate and developing planted filters optimized for pesticide removal laboratory microcosm experiments are usually conducted to simulate the fate of chemicals in the environment oecd 2002a 2002b 2004 although pesticide fate has been widely determined in different environmental matrices such as soil and water sediment with stable or radioactive isotope labeled pesticide nowak et al 2018 shrestha et al 2016 wang et al 2016 fate analyses in the presence of plants are rare and there is no generally accepted test which includes plants previous studies of chemical fate with plants usually applied complex air flow through setup and could not elucidate the detailed microbial degradation processes of the applied 14c labeled chemicals hand et al 2020 sun et al 2014 plants can influence the fate of pesticide in the environmental matrices via uptake and the formed rhizosphere conditions plants diffuse oxygen into the matrices changing the redox conditions they consume nutrients such as no3 in the matrices and also release root exudates which provide carbon sources for microorganisms jones et al 2009 we thus hypothesized that the degradation rate and the microbial metabolism of pesticide as a carbon and nitrogen source are different in planted matrices compared to that in the unplanted counterparts therefore the overall aim of this study was to develop a microcosm test for detailed fate assessment of isotope labeled pesticides in planted filters reed canary grass phalaris arundinacea was planted due to its frequent application in planted filters vymazal 2013 and the prominent development of roots vymazal and kröpfelová 2008 which might favor degradation of pesticides in the filter gravel was employed as the substrate for the microcosms because of its common use 13c and 15n co labeled glyphosate n phosphonomethyl glycine was selected as a model pesticide because of the following three reasons firstly glyphosate is one of the most applied pesticide worldwide and can be carried away from the application site by runoff water lupi et al 2019 maggi et al 2020 which is one important reason for its frequent detection in surface waters worldwide carles et al 2019 geng et al 2021 okada et al 2020 secondly the degradation pattern of glyphosate is well known zhan et al 2018 which allows to track the detailed fate of the pesticide and thus facilitates studying the influence of rhizosphere thirdly although high removal of glyphosate by planted filters was reported the detailed fate processes contributing to the removal are still unexplored imfeld et al 2013 lópez chávez et al 2021 the specific objective of the study was to establish the comprehensive mass balance of 2 13c 15n glyphosate fate which included quantifying the isotope labels in i mineralization ii degradation products iii incorporation of 13c and 15n into microbial biomass amino acids in the rhizosphere and iv plant biomass roots and shoots in addition we also investigated the label distribution in different compartments pore water gravel plants and microbial pellets from rhizosphere of the microcosms the obtained results in planted microcosms were compared with that in unplanted microcosms 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals 2 13c 15n glyphosate 99 atom 13c 98 atom 15n and unlabeled glyphosate 99 purity were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis usa and used for the incubation experiment ampa and sarcosine purity 98 were both obtained from sigma aldrich and glycine j t baker was obtained from avantor deventer netherland all other chemicals were of analytical grade and purchased from sigma aldrich milliq water 18 mω was produced from a milli q machine merck darmstadt germany chemicals used for lc ms analysis were listed in text s1 s 1 1 2 2 gravel gravel quartz 6 8 mm weco gmbh co kg leer germany for ornamental use was purchased from a local market leipzig germany the gravel was sieved to remove the fine particles 4 mm the iron and aluminum from amorphous metal oxides in gravel were extracted with ammonium oxalate solution according to the method of schwertmann 1964 and determined with inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes arcos spectro gmbh kleve germany the amorphous iron content was 150 mg kg and the amorphous aluminum content was 26 mg kg the organic matter content measured by loss on ignition at 450 c was 0 2 w w the ph was 4 5 h2o and 4 3 0 01 m cacl2 2 3 setup of the microcosms and incubation with glyphosate five different treatments were prepared 1 planted microcosm with 2 13c 15n glyphosate planted labeled test 2 planted microcosm with unlabeled glyphosate unlabeled control 3 planted microcosm without glyphosate blank control 4 unplanted microcosm with 2 13c 15n glyphosate unplanted control 5 unplanted microcosm with unlabeled glyphosate unplanted unlabeled control the amount of 13c and 15n calculated based on total c or n concentration and the ratio of the heavy isotope to the light one as at in the labeled treatments 1 and 4 was corrected for the natural abundance of these isotopes by subtracting the amount of 13c or 15n in the corresponding treatments with unlabeled glyphosate 2 and 5 the blank control 3 provided the information about the potential inhibitive effect of glyphosate on plant growth all treatments consisted of three replicates the microcosms were set up in 1 l glass jars the jar was sealed with a glass lid with a rubber sealing ring 1000 g of gravel was placed in each microcosm the setup of planted microcosms is illustrated in fig 1 a the lid was perforated with six holes of 1 cm diameter allowing plants to grow through as well as watering and sampling fig 1b three to four seedlings of reed canary grass stem height around 20 cm were planted in the microcosms and grew with 2 g l fertilizer hakaphos soft spezial which was replenished every week for two months before the application of glyphosate one week before glyphosate application the rhizosphere part was sealed for plant adaption by closing the holes on the lid the holes for plants were first filled with soft clay and finally sealed with silicone rubber sealant tfc silicone rubber type 1 troll factory riede germany the other holes were closed by rubber stoppers for trapping 13co2 and 12co2 a 25 ml glass vessel for naoh solution was placed in the rhizosphere part the vessel was held in position by a stainless steel wire mounted to a rubber stopper sampling and replacement of naoh solution could be conducted by a syringe through the cannula installed in the rubber stopper when not in use the cannula was closed with a luer lock b braun melsungen germany for the unplanted microcosms the lids of the jars did not contain any holes the unplanted microcosms were fertilized with 2 g l hakaphos soft spezial twice 1st directly after preparation of the microcosms 2nd one week before glyphosate application the glass vessels for naoh solution were mounted inside the microcosms the lids were opened during sampling and replacement of naoh solution for the short time needed for the procedure the outer walls of all the microcosm jars were covered with aluminum foil to minimize algae growth all the microcosms were placed in a greenhouse with controlled conditions and located at helmholtz centre for environmental research ufz leipzig germany the temperature was kept at 22 c from 6 am to 9 pm and at 16 c at night thus providing standard conditions allowing for optimal plant growth light produced from master son pia lamps 400 w phillips belgium was supplied when the illuminance by natural light fell below 60 klx after around two months when the stem height of the plants reached around 30 40 cm water was removed from all the microcosms by evapotranspiration for the planted microcosms or by decanting for the unplanted microcosms thereafter 200 ml of 20 mg l glyphosate solution unlabeled or 2 13c 15n co labeled in tap water or only tap water blank control was loaded into the microcosms the applied concentration of glyphosate was much higher than that found in the runoff water or surface waters ranged from several to hundreds of μg l geng et al 2021 lefrancq et al 2017 however such high amount of glyphosate was needed to ensure isotopic enrichment in the samples not being masked by the natural abundances of 13c and 15n previous study by wang et al 2016 showed that the mineralization rate of glyphosate at high concentration 50 mg l in water sediment was a bit slower than that at low concentration of 3 mg l but the ultimate cumulative mineralization at the two concentrations was the same about 60 of the initially added 13c at the end 80 days the resulting water level in each microcosm was around 1 cm below the top of the gravel naoh solution 2 m 10 ml was added to the glass vessels the last supply of nutrients to all microcosms was one week before dosing glyphosate during the incubation period the planted microcosms were supplemented only with tap water every two days to compensate for water loss by plant transpiration and to maintain the water level water was not supplemented for the unplanted microcosms due to insignificant loss all microcosms were incubated for 31 days 2 4 sampling and analysis 2 4 1 sampling procedure during the incubation period naoh solution with co2 13co2 trapped was sampled and replaced every four days for the unplanted microcosms and every two days for the planted microcosms due to the high respiration of rhizosphere three water samples of around 300 µl were taken from the microcosms to determine the concentrations of glyphosate and its degradation products ampa sarcosine and glycine on days 0 5 13 22 and 31 after 31 days when the incubation was terminated the microcosms were opened plants were retrieved by carefully separating the roots from gravel they were then divided into shoots and roots and the fresh weights were recorded the roots and shoots were thereafter lyophilized and ground to powder with a mixer mill mm2000 retsch haan germany prior to further analysis the pore water was withdrawn after manually shaking the gravel and pore water for a few minutes the suspended microbial biomass in the pore water was collected by centrifugation 5000 g 20 min 4 c and retrieving the pellets biofilms attached to plant roots and gravel were extracted with 200 ml and 300 ml of 10 mm phosphate buffered saline pbs solution ph 7 respectively weber and legge 2010 by shaking at 300 rpm unimax 1010 heidolph schwabach germany for 1 h at 25 c the extraction was conducted twice consecutively the obtained extracts were then centrifuged and the pellets were collected after removing the supernatants all harvested microbial biomass pellets were lyophilized for further analysis and the dry weights were recorded 2 4 2 mineralization analysis 13co2 from the mineralization of 13c in 2 13c 15n glyphosate was quantified based on the amount of total inorganic carbon tic trapped into the naoh solution and the 13c 12c isotope ratio at 13c 12c of co2 released by addition of phosphoric acid 85 in an airtight headspace vial girardi et al 2013

5000 g 20 min 4 c adsorption on gravel glyphosate and ampa adsorbed on gravel were extracted with 400 ml of 0 3 m naoh solution by shaking 300 rpm 1 h 25 c after removing the biofilm on gravel by pbs solution the extraction was conducted three times consecutively the extracts were combined and diluted with milliq h2o in an appropriate amount to have concentrations of glyphosate and ampa in the calibration range of 0 05 50 µg l for quantification plants to extract glyphosate and ampa from the plant material 80 mg of shoot or 25 mg of root was mixed with 10 ml of h2o dcm 1 1 v v before the extraction the plant material was spiked with 50 µl of 10 mg l 13c3 15n glyphosate and 13c15n ampa in milliq water as internal standards to correct for the extraction efficiency and matrix effect the extraction was conducted by vortexing for 1 h and subsequently sonicating 35 khz bandelin sonorex tk 52 berlin germany for 20 min the mixtures were then centrifuged 10 000 g 20 min 4 c the supernatant from the upper water phase 500 µl was withdrawn and diluted to a final volume of 1 ml with milliq h2o prior to the quantification of glyphosate and ampa the analyses of glyphosate ampa sarcosine and glycine were described in detail in text s1 briefly they were analyzed by lc ms ms after derivatization with fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl chloride fmoc cl muskus et al 2019 sun et al 2019 the lc ms ms comprised a 1260 infinity ii lc system agilent santa clara usa coupled to a qtrap 6500 ms ab sciex darmstadt germany with an electrospray ionization esi source a zorbax extend c18 column 2 1 100 mm 3 5 µm particle size narrow bore rr agilent us was used to separate the analytes glyphosate and ampa were separated with a gradient of 5 mm ammonium acetate ph 9 and methanol as mobile phases and detected in negative ion mode sarcosine and glycine were separated with a gradient of 5 mm acetic acid ammonium acetate and acetonitrile as mobile phases and detected in positive ion mode the limits of quantification loq were 0 04 µg l for glyphosate and 0 12 µg l for ampa 0 64 µg l for sarcosine and 0 69 µg l for glycine 2 4 4 analysis of amino acids aas aas were hydrolyzed from the proteins of microbial biomass pellets collected from the endpoint pore water pbs extracts of gravel and root biofilm with 6 m hcl at 110 c for 22 h according to the method of nowak et al 2011 the obtained hydrolysates were then passed through a glass microfiber filter 0 7 µm puradisc 25 gf f whatman buckinghamshire uk and dried under n2 prior to derivatization the details of derivatization and subsequent purification were described previously nowak et al 2011 finally the samples were dissolved in hexane with 20 ethyl acetate for further analysis the amounts of 13c and 15n incorporated into the aas were calculated based on the amount of individual aa measured by gc ms and their corresponding isotopic composition 13c 12c and 15n 14n determined by gc c irms the detailed instrumental methods are listed in text s3 2 4 5 analysis by elemental analyzer the total amounts of c and n and the corresponding isotope ratios of c 13c 12c and n 15n 14n in the microbial pellets plants and the endpoint pore water were analyzed with elemental analyzer ea irms ea flash 2000 thermo conflo iv thermo delta v advantage irms thermo bremen germany all calibration curves for c and n concentrations exhibited r2 0 99 2 5 mass balance and data analysis the amounts of 13c and 15n were determined in different compartments of the microcosms pore water gravel plants naoh trapping solution and pellets collected from the endpoint pore water gravel biofilm and root biofilm the recovered amounts of 13c and 15n in each compartment are presented as the percentages of the initially applied amount of 2 13c 15n glyphosate the mass balance of 13c and 15n was calculated by the sum of the percentages the measured amounts of 13c and 15n in the aas were used to represent the labeled microbial proteins since protein accounts for around 55 of the dry weight of microbial cells madigan 2015 a conversion factor of 1 8 was used to estimate the total amounts of 13c and 15n from 2 13c 15n glyphosate incorporated into the microbial biomass all data are presented as average value standard deviation of three replicates the difference between the planted microcosms and the unplanted microcosms was compared by using unpaired t test and was considered significant if p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 glyphosate and its degradation products 3 1 1 concentrations in the pore water the concentrations of glyphosate ampa glycine and sarcosine in the pore water were monitored over the incubation period to check the dissipation of glyphosate and the detection of degradation products the concentrations of glyphosate in the pore water dropped rapidly within several hours to 9 2 1 2 mg l in the planted and to 4 8 0 3 mg l in the unplanted microcosms after glyphosate application fig 2 such a rapid dissipation of glyphosate from the pore water implied that sorption occurred in the microcosms the glyphosate concentration then decreased slowly from day 5 onwards ampa was already detected on day 5 at 21 5 μg l in the planted and at 12 1 μg l in the unplanted microcosms then the concentration of ampa increased to a maximum of 40 20 μg l on day 22 in the planted microcosms and remained almost stable thereafter the concentration of ampa in the unplanted microcosms reached a maximum of 15 4 μg l on day 13 and afterwards decreased slightly until the end we did not detect glycine and sarcosine on any sampling date both sarcosine and glycine produced from glyphosate degradation in the microcosms may have been utilized very fast by the microorganisms noteworthy is that the concentrations of ampa were two orders of magnitude lower than those of glyphosate comparing with the initially applied concentration of glyphosate 20 mg l relatively low concentrations of glyphosate 1 mg l and ampa maximum 40 µg l were detected in the pore water after 31 days indicating high removal of glyphosate from the water in both microcosms the concentrations of glyphosate in the unplanted were always lower p 0 05 at each sampling date than in the planted microcosms this thus suggests that the unplanted microcosms exhibited higher removal of glyphosate from the water than the planted microcosms however higher p 0 05 concentrations of ampa were detected on day 31 in the planted 39 16 μg l than in the unplanted microcosms 6 6 μg l after terminating the incubation 10 9 2 2 of the initial amount of glyphosate was found in the planted pore water and ampa accounted for 0 4 0 2 of the initial amount of glyphosate in the unplanted microcosms glyphosate accounted for 1 8 1 1 and ampa for 0 1 0 03 high removal of glyphosate from water was also observed by lópez chávez et al 2021 in their study more than 98 of the initially applied glyphosate was dissipated during water passage through both planted and unplanted wetlands after 47 days however the removal of glyphosate from the planted pore water in this study around 89 was lower than that in their study the high removal in their unplanted wetlands was mainly due to sorption of the glyphosate on the gravel while that in their planted wetlands was attributed to both sorption and degradation of the glyphosate 3 1 2 adsorption on gravel the adsorption capacity of glyphosate ampa glycine and sarcosine on the gravel was studied in an independent batch experiment details in text s4 and the result was presented in fig s1 it showed that more than 85 of the initially applied amount of glyphosate and ampa was adsorbed on the gravel within 2 h and the adsorption increased to 98 after 24 h the adsorption of glycine and sarcosine on the gravel was less than 20 after terminating the incubation of the microcosms the glyphosate and ampa adsorbed on gravel were released by both pbs solution and naoh solution table s3 glyphosate and ampa were desorbed into the pbs solution due to the competition of phosphate in pbs with the phosphonate group of glyphosate and ampa for sorption sites on gravel lópez chávez et al 2021 pereira et al 2019 in total the glyphosate adsorbed on gravel accounted for 59 5 6 5 of the initially added glyphosate in the planted microcosms and for 86 4 1 2 in the unplanted microcosms thus the adsorption of glyphosate on gravel was the main fate of glyphosate in the microcosms in addition the adsorption was lower p 0 05 in the planted microcosms than in the unplanted counterparts therefore higher removal of glyphosate from the pore water was observed in the unplanted microcosms in section 3 1 1 the high adsorption of glyphosate on gravel was also observed in other studies lópez chávez et al 2021 strange hansen et al 2004 the adsorption of glyphosate was associated with the contents of iron and aluminum oxides of the solid matrices piccolo et al 1994 the iron and aluminum oxides are prone to form inner sphere complexes with the phosphonate group of glyphosate as the distance of the oh groups of the phosphonate group matches well with the lattice geometry of the oxides sheals et al 2002 in addition iron and aluminum oxides have high point of zero charge phpzc above 7 0 pereira et al 2019 at ph phpzc they are positively charged and thus can sorb the negatively charged glyphosate present at common environmental ph conditions hence the adsorption of glyphosate on gravel is also associated with ph although the amorphous iron and aluminum contents in the gravel 150 mg fe kg and 26 mg al kg of this study were lower than those of the gravel 202 mg fe kg and 49 mg al kg studied by albers et al 2020 the adsorption of glyphosate on the gravel in this study was higher this divergence might be due to the lower ph of the gravel in this study 4 5 than those in the study of albers 8 4 and 9 0 at low ph the iron and aluminum oxides are more positively charged and thus can sorb the negatively charged glyphosate stronger and with a higher capacity the lower adsorption of glyphosate on the planted gravel than on the unplanted gravel can be attributed to the following four explanations 1 the dense biofilms developed on the planted gravel sheltered the adsorption sites of glyphosate the extracted biomass from the gravel biofilm was more than 10 fold higher in the planted microcosms 31 5 4 8 mg than that in the unplanted counterparts 2 5 0 4 mg 2 the higher amount of phosphorus in the planted microcosms occupied some sorption sites for glyphosate table s4 phosphate was found to compete for sorption sites of glyphosate in soils or minerals borggaard and gimsing 2008 gimsing et al 2004 the sorption capacity for glyphosate thus can be reduced by prior application of phosphate munira et al 2018 in this study prior to glyphosate application nutrient containing phosphate was supplied more often to the planted microcosms for supporting plant growth than to the unplanted microcosms section 2 3 although the plants utilized substantial part of the added phosphate there could be still some phosphate adsorbed on gravel hampering the adsorption of glyphosate 3 root exudates or their mediated microbial activity liberated the adsorbed glyphosate li et al 2021 root exudates were not analyzed in this study instead the doc concentration in the pore water was measured which was higher in the planted microcosms 14 2 2 3 mg l than in the unplanted microcosms 7 9 0 8 mg l suggesting root exudates were present besides the higher amount of microbial biomass collected from the planted microcosms also indicated the contribution of root exudates 4 more metal oxides in gravel were presumably reduced in the planted microcosms than in the unplanted counterparts therefore the sorption of glyphosate in the planted microcosms decreased a black color presumably caused by precipitation of metal sulfides under anoxic conditions janssen et al 1997 was observed at the greater depth of the planted gravel fig s2 but not in the unplanted microcosms which suggests the planted microcosms were more anoxic in summary both the rhizosphere condition and nutrient application for plant development may have influenced the sorption of glyphosate on gravel in the planted microcosms but we cannot decide which factor contributed most in this study 3 2 mineralization of glyphosate the release of 13co2 from 2 13c 15n glyphosate was measured over the 31 day incubation period the detected 13co2 in the microcosms increased slowly from day 0 without a lag phase fig 3 the ultimate cumulative mineralization of 13c from 2 13c 15n glyphosate accounted for 4 1 of the initially added 13c in the planted microcosms and 1 1 in the unplanted microcosms the higher mineralization of 2 13c 15n glyphosate in the planted microcosms than in the unplanted microcosms could be attributed to the higher amount of doc in the planted microcosms table s4 which could have promoted the activity of microbial degraders the mineralization of glyphosate was relatively low in the microcosms compared with that in soil and water sediment reported by others muskus et al 2019 sun et al 2019 wang et al 2016 mineralization of glyphosate was found to be negatively correlated to its adsorption by soil zablotowicz et al 2009 however higher adsorption of glyphosate on soil than on gravel was reported albers et al 2020 strange hansen et al 2004 moreover although the adsorption capacity of gravel in this study is lower than that reported by strange hansen et al 2004 the mineralization of glyphosate in this study was much lower than that in strange hansen study with comparable concentration of glyphosate 17 mg l in their study applied therefore the low mineralization of glyphosate in this study cannot be attributed only to its high adsorption on the gravel the microbial activities and microcosm conditions may also have influenced the mineralization of glyphosate stenrod et al 2006 von wirén lehr et al 1997 several studies have shown that glyphosate is less degraded in oxygen limited soil microcosms kanissery et al 2015 la cecilia and maggi 2018 as the microcosms in this study were water saturated we assume that the oxygen level was low at least at greater depths although plants can transport oxygen into the microcosms the planted microcosms are still believed to be oxygen deficient the evidence for this is the black color at the greater depth of the gravel fig s2 as discussed in section 3 1 2 3 3 incorporation of elements into microbial biomass the 13c and 15n derived from 2 13c 15n glyphosate in aas were used to quantify the label incorporation into the microbial biomass 1 5 0 9 of the initially applied 13c and 3 8 1 7 of the initially applied 15n considering the conversion factor 1 8 see section 2 5 were incorporated into the microbial biomass collected from the planted microcosms however the isotope assimilation into the biomass was much lower in the unplanted microcosms 0 2 0 08 of the initially applied 13c and 0 1 0 01 of the initially applied 15n although these percentage values are very low the 13c and 15n isotope enrichments of aas were significant as compared to the unlabeled control natural abundance the incorporation of 13c and 15n into the microbial biomass indicated that 2 13c 15n glyphosate degraded through sarcosine glycine pathways apart from ampa pathways fig 4 glycine was most abundant in 13c and 15n according to the labeling patterns of individual aa fig 5 the 13c15n glycine could be either the direct product of glycine pathway or yielded from the degradation of 13c15n sarcosine both pathways are energetically favorable brock et al 2019 the produced glycine can be directly incorporated into the microbial proteins as a monomeric building block which also saves energy for microorganisms during anabolism nelson et al 2017 noteworthy is that the amount of 15n labeled glutamate was much lower than 15n glycine in the unplanted microcosms fig 5d while the 15n labeled glutamate had similar amount to 15n glycine in the planted microcosms fig 5b this indicates deamination of 15n glutamate could have happened in the unplanted microcosms the higher amount of inorganic n in the unplanted microcosms than that in planted microcosms could have led to deamination of aas to excrete the overloaded 15n from sarcosine glycine degradation pathway the possible inorganic 15n is unlikely to derive from 15n ampa degradation because the degradation of ampa can be inhibited by the low c n ratios in the microcosms doc tn ratio in the endpoint pore water was 8 27 2 83 in the planted microcosms and was 0 04 0 003 in the unplanted counterparts see table s4 brock et al 2019 3 4 uptake by plants glyphosate did not influence the biomass of plants which was comparable in microcosms with and without glyphosate table s5 a small portion of 13c 1 3 of the initially added 2 13c 15n glyphosate was only found in the roots table s6 with ea analysis while 15n was found both in shoots and roots and accounted for 2 2 in total however 2 13c 15n glyphosate was detected also in shoots with lc ms ms analysis it suggests that a small amount of 13c was also incorporated into the shoots but it was not detectable due to the high carbon content of shoots the glyphosate in plants shoots roots accounted for 0 4 0 3 of the initially added glyphosate whereas ampa for 0 02 0 01 the amounts of 2 13c 15n glyphosate and 15n ampa in plants were three to five times lower than the total amounts of 13c and 15n in plants the possible reasons can be that i glyphosate and ampa in plants were mostly transformed ii more degradation products of glyphosate were transported into plants than glyphosate itself and iii glyphosate or ampa formed phase ii conjugates or underwent phase iii compartmentation in plants which masked their presence and detection in plants van eerd et al 2003 3 5 mass balance of 13c and 15n from 2 13c 15n glyphosate in the microcosms the 13c and 15n mass balances from 2 13c 15n glyphosate in the microcosms are shown in fig 6 a d the recovery of 13c and 15n was 80 5 8 5 and 84 8 4 5 in the planted microcosms and 90 7 0 5 and 93 1 0 4 in the unplanted microcosms the recovery of 13c and 15n was thus lower in the planted microcosms than that in the unplanted counterparts the lower recovery of 13c presumably resulted from the loss of 13co2 by plant aerenchyma grundmann et al 2008 the lost 13co2 could result from the degradation of 2 13c 15n glyphosate or its degradation products in plants the lower recovery of 15n could be ascribed to the loss of 15n2 which could result from inorganic 15n reduction under anaerobic conditions in the planted microcosms in both microcosms 13c and 15n was dominantly adsorbed on gravel as 2 13c 15n glyphosate and in particular in the unplanted microcosms 86 of the initially added isotope in the planted pore water 15n was attributed to 2 13c 15n glyphosate and 15n ampa fig 6e in the unplanted pore water around 12 3 of 15n could not be identified fig 6f and it was most likely inorganic 15n 15nh4 or 15no3 derived from the deamination of the 15n aas section 3 3 4 conclusions and outlook with the microcosm test we established the mass balance of the model pesticide glyphosate fate in planted and unplanted water gravel microcosms and achieved good recovery of the pesticide the comprehensive fate of the pesticide in the rhizosphere was elucidated by including sorption on substrate mineralization degradation products and incorporation of elements into microbial biomass and compared with that in unplanted microcosms plants influenced the microbial utilization of the pesticide as a carbon and nitrogen source as revealed by 13c 15n colabeling approach although the degradation of the pesticide was promoted in the planted microcosms the adsorption on the gravel as the dominant fate was lower than that in unplanted microcosms leading to higher amount of the pesticide detected in the planted pore water in this case strategies such as increasing the hydraulic retention time of water are needed to increase degradation of the pesticide in planted filters for meeting the requirement of water quality for effluent the fate of chemicals under the influence of plants is largely unknown especially in planted filters this microcosm set up could serve as a reference for such studies but establishing mass balance of the chemical fate is only possible for non volatile compounds the advantage of this microcosm set up is the simplicity and that it can be used for other substrates to be applied in wetlands or for agricultural soils furthermore the influence of plants on chemical fate applying microcosm set up under controlled laboratory conditions is not considered yet in regulatory testing of chemicals e g reach regulation therefore this microcosm test also could be developed as a future standardized oecd

15357,quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra of human health risks using human fecal marker genes hfmgs is an useful water quality management tool to inform accurate qmra analysis generation of probability distribution functions for hfmgs and reference pathogenic viruses can be improved by input of correlation and ratios based upon measurement of hfmgs and gene copies gc of pathogenic viruses in untreated wastewater the concentrations of four hfmgs bacteroides hf183 lachnospiraceae lachno3 crassphage and pepper mild mottle virus pmmov and gc of three reference pathogenic viruses human adenovirus 40 41 hadv 40 41 human norovirus gi gii hnov gi gii and enterovirus ev were measured in untreated wastewater samples collected over a period of 12 months from two wastewater treatment plants in sydney australia using quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr and reverse transcription qpcr rt qpcr over the course of the study the gc of potential pathogenic viruses were 3 5 orders of magnitude lower than hfmgs in untreated wastewater the gc of pathogenic viruses were highly variable over the course of the study which contrasted with the concentrations of hfmgs that were quite stable with little variation observed within and between wwtps among the hfmgs hf183 crassphage and pmmov correlated well with pathogenic virus gc whereas weak or negative correlations were observed between lachno3 and pathogenic virus gc while the two assessed wwtps had dissimilar population service sizes the ratios between log10 transformed pathogenic virus gc and hfmgs demonstrated similar central tendency and variability for the same combinations between wwtp a and wwtp b with no difference between the wwtps this suggests the widespread presence of these hfmgs in both populations serviced by these two wwtps the observed correlation and ratios of hfmgs and gc of reference pathogenic viruses can contribute to improved qmra of human health risks in environmental waters subject to fresh sewer overflows graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fecal pollution mst marker gene wastewater viruses data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction fecal contamination of aquatic environments is one of the major water quality issues worldwide an et al 2020 wang et al 2022 various point and non point sources such as wastewater discharges caused by wet weather infiltration and inflow stormwater and dry weather overflows industrial effluents and feces from animals such as dogs cattle and wildlife can increase the load of fecal contamination by orders of magnitude in environmental waters olds et al 2018 senkbeil et al 2019 franklin et al 2020 mckee et al 2021 between animal and human fecal contamination sources human wastewater poses a greater risk to human health due to the presence of pathogenic viruses such as human norovirus hnov enterovirus ev and human adenovirus hadv among others fong et al 2005 soller et al 2010 rodríguez lázaro et al 2012 corpuz et al 2020 however the impairment of water quality is generally assessed by monitoring fecal indicator bacteria fib such as escherichia coli and enterococcus spp using culture based methods usepa 1986a 1986b 2012 fujioka et al 2015 fib are highly abundant in the feces of humans and animals and generally co occur with pathogens therefore the presence of fib in environmental waters indicates the potential presence of pathogens and potential human health risks fib monitoring is widely used for regulatory purposes however there are known limitations such as the exceedance of fib above recommended guidelines not always correlating with the presence of pathogens for which they proxy for lemarchand and lebaron 2003 harwood et al 2005 ortega et al 2009 inactivation rates of fib in aquatic environments may be different than those of pathogens ahmed et al 2021a and under favourable conditions certain strains of fib can replicate in beach sands halliday and gast 2011 soil ishii et al 2006 surface waters whitman et al 2006 and plants wright et al 2017 most importantly the presence of fib in an aquatic environment provides no information as to the specific contamination source given fib are present in the feces of all animals ahmed et al 2016 for the remediation of polluted water bodies to achieve their designated use it is vital for water utilities and regulators to identify the source s of the fecal contamination this can be accomplished using microbial source tracking mst techniques that identify and quantify the magnitude of fecal pollution in environmental waters stoeckel and harwood 2007 mst is an important tool for water quality managers and utilities to target areas where remediation works are required in the catchment the past several decades many mst marker genes have been identified and quantitative pcr qpcr assays developed for a range of fecal input sources from human cattle pig dog chicken seagull possum and other animals reviewed in harwood et al 2014 many laboratory and field studies have shown that analyses of these marker gene s can be used to identify sources of fecal contamination in environmental water samples with a high degree of accuracy and precision feng et al 2018 shanks et al 2012 another important application of mst marker genes is their association with human health risk outcomes several proof of concept studies have established a link between mst marker genes and pathogen risks in environmental waters ahmed et al 2018a boehm et al 2018 staley et al 2012 symonds et al 2016 in most of these studies concentrations of human fecal marker genes hfmgs were linked to reference viral pathogen s in a hypothetical waterbody impacted by untreated wastewater the concentration of mst marker genes corresponding to the united states environmental protection agency usepa recreational water quality criteria rwqc risk benchmarks were then used to compute a concentration below which there would be a sufficiently low health risk for primary contact recreational activities using quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra usepa 2012 moreover mst markers have also been used to calibrate catchment based hydrological pathogen fate and transport model into qmra for flood plains and river systems in austria derx et al 2016 2021 these approaches are attractive water quality management tools however there are several improvements that need to be incorporated for accurate qmra analysis these include the lack of appropriate dose response models accounting for differences among exposed populations the ratio of infectious vs non infectious pathogens incorporation of marker gene and pathogen loss through sample processing steps and understanding the decay and dilution patterns of these marker genes and pathogens in receiving waters ahmed et al 2019 while the concentrations of mst marker genes are expected to be more consistent in untreated wastewater viral pathogens such as hnov hadv 40 41 ev and other viruses will exhibit temporal and spatial variations associated with their varying prevalence in the community nordgren et al 2009 ahmed et al 2021b furthermore little has been documented on the concentrations of viral pathogens in untreated wastewater samples especially in australia and the ratio between hfmgs and gene copies gc of potential viral pathogens such information is important for improved qmra of sewer overflows utilizing hfmgs ahmed et al 2020 the aims of this study were to i measure the concentrations of four hfmgs bacteroides hf183 lachnospiraceae lachno3

wallis h test with dunn s post hoc test for multiple comparisons kruskal and wallis 1952 dunn 1964 the strength of the association between hfmgs and pathogenic virus gc concentrations in untreated wastewater at each wwtp was assessed by spearman rank correlation with a two tailed p value spearman 1904 in general r 0 7 was considered a strong positive correlation r 0 4 but 0 7 was moderate correlation and r 0 2 but 0 4 was weak correlation ahmed et al 2015b unpaired t tests were performed to compare the mean concentrations of hfmgs and pathogenic virus gc between wwtp a and b statistical significance was defined as p 0 05 and graphpad prism version 8 3 1 was used for statistical analysis graphpad software inc la jolla ca usa probability distribution functions pdfs were fit to the observed gc of pathogenic viruses at each individual wwtp n 36 using crystal ball release 11 1 2 4 900 oracle corporation austin tx usa gumple 1935 goodness of fit was assessed for a test pool of twenty different pdfs with the best fit selected as the one which yielded the lowest value of the anderson darling test statistic anderson and darling 1952 stephens 1979 the anderson darling test makes use of a quadratic empirical distribution function to measure the distance between a modelled distribution function and the empirical distribution of the data the best fit pdfs along with the anderson darling test statistic value and resulting p value were tabulated for each marker gene and virus gc in wastewater the best fit was considered statistically acceptable if the p value was 0 05

shown in supplementary table st3 turbidity in wastewater samples from wwtp a varied and ranged from 110 to 690 ntu turbidity of wwtp b samples were relatively lower than wwtp a ranging from 98 to 370 ntu dissolved oxygen in 11 of 12 wwtp a samples ranged from 0 80 to 5 30 mg l dissolved oxygen measurement could not be taken in one wastewater sample from wwtp a on 12 09 2019 due to malfunctioning instrument dissolved oxygen in wwtp b samples ranged from 0 10 to 5 30 mg l ph for the wastewater samples collected from wwtp a ranged from 7 42 to 8 31 while wwtp b ranged from 7 74 to 8 32 of the 24 wastewater samples from wwtp a and b e coli and enterococci were detected in all wastewater samples ranging from 6 78 to 7 28 log10 cfu of e coli and 5 73 to 6 55 log10 cfu enterococci 100 ml of wastewater in wwtp a supplementary table st3 the concentrations of e coli and enterococci in wwtp b were similar to wwtp a ranging from 6 68 to 7 26 log10 cfu of e coli and 5 67 to 6 52 log10 cfu enterococci 100 ml the mean concentrations of e coli in untreated wastewater samples were significantly p 0 0001 different than enterococci for both wwtps 3 2 qpcr and rt qpcr performance characteristics the qpcr and rt qpcr standard curves prepared from synthetic dna had a linear dynamic range of quantification from 3 5 106 to 3 6 gc reaction 1 106 to 1 gc µl the slopes of the standard curves ranged between 3 15 crassphage cpq 056 and 3 34 both hnov gi and gii assays supplementary table st4 the ranges for amplification efficiencies 99 3 to 108 and y intercepts 35 4 to 39 8 were within the prescribed range of miqe guidelines bustin et al 2009 the correlation coefficients r2 ranged from 0 97 to 0 99 for all qpcr and rt qpcr assays all positive controls or standard curve materials amplified in each pcr qpcr rt pcr and rt qpcr run 3 3 alod and pcr inhibition the alods for the qpcr and rt qpcr assays were between 5 80 and 21 7 gc reaction being the lowest for the pmmov and greatest for hnov gi assays respectively supplementary table st4 all wastewater nucleic acid samples were within the 2 cq values of the reference cq value thus no qpcr inhibition was identified supplementary fig sf1 3 4 concentrations of hfmgs and pathogenic viruses in untreated wastewater the concentrations of hfmgs hf183 lachno3 crassphage pmmov were greater than the qpcr and rt qpcr alod the gc of hadv 40 41 hnov gii and ev were greater than the rt qpcr alod however for hnov gi only 33 of 72 wastewater samples had gc greater than the alod gc of hnov gi and gii were combined i e hnov gi gii by summing respective gc numbers the pooled concentrations of hfmgs and pathogenic virus gc in untreated wastewater samples over 12 sampling events are shown in fig 1 in a box and whisker plot format supplementary fig sf2 sf8 are showing the concentrations of hfmgs and potential pathogenic virus gc in each sampling event during the study among the four hfmgs the mean lachno3 concentrations were the highest 9 47 log10 gc l in untreated wastewater samples from wwtp a followed by crassphage 9 13 log10 gc l hf183 9 09 log10 gc l and pmmov 8 54 log10 gc l the mean gc of hadv 5 09 log10 gc l hnov gi gii 4 86 log10 gc l and ev 4 76 log10 gc l were 4 to 5 orders of magnitude lower than those hfmgs similar trends were also observed for wastewater samples collected from wwtp b descriptive statistics are presented in table 1 the kruskal wallis one way anova was conducted to determine if there are any significant differences in the hfmgs and pathogenic virus gc from each wwtp dunn s multiple comparisons test indicated that the concentrations of hfmgs did not differ significantly from each other except lachno3 and pmmov concentrations were significantly different p 0 0032 from each other in untreated wastewater samples collected from wwtp a supplementary table st5 gc concentrations of each and all pathogenic viruses were significantly different p 0 0001 than hfmgs similar results were also observed for wwtp b except lachno3 and pmmov concentrations were significantly different p 0 0017 from each other in addition to crassphage and pmmov supplementary table st6 an additional kruskal wallis one way anova indicated the mean concentrations of hfmgs and pathogenic virus gc in untreated wastewater samples from wwtp a did not differ significantly p 0 05 from wwtp b 3 5 correlation between hfmgs and gc of pathogenic viruses there were significant correlations between hfmgs and pathogenic virus gc at both wwtp a and wwtp b represented in the spearman rank order correlation matrix table 2 among the 21 bivariate comparisons at each location there were 14 66 statistically significant correlations at wwtp a and 17 81 at wwtp b there were strong positive correlations at wwtp a r 0 7 between hf183 and hadv 40 41 r 0 788 and ev r 0 702 respectively and at wwtp b there was strong positive correlation between hf183 and hnov gi gii hf183 positively correlated with all hfmgs and pathogenic viruses except lachno3 for both wwtps lachno3 only correlated with crassphage in wwtp a and crassphage and hnov gi gii in wwtp b crassphage correlated with hadv 40 41 and hnov gi and gii in wwtp a and all three pathogenic viruses in wwtp b pmmov also correlated with all three pathogenic viruses in both wwtp a and b significant correlations were also observed among three pathogenic virus gc in both wwtps table 2 these results suggest that viral hfmgs such as crassphage and pmmov exhibit more consistent and stronger quantitative relationships with viral pathogens than hf183 and lachno3 and would therefore by more relevant for risk assessments performed via hfmg measurements and application of pathogens to hfmgs ratios 3 6 ratio between hfmgs and pathogenic virus gc in untreated wastewater box and whisker plots of the ratio of log10 transformed gc of each pathogenic virus to each hfmg at both wwtp a and wwtp b are illustrated in fig 2 while log10 gc ratios at each wwtp are illustrated in sf9 hf183 sf10 lachno3 sf11 crassphage and sf12 pmmov on a log10 ratio basis hadv 40 41 was consistently the most enriched i e the proportion increased compared to other pathogenic viruses pathogen relative to each hfmgs with mean log10 ratios at each wwtp ranging from 0 68 hadv 40 41 lachno3 wwtp a to 0 77 hadv 40 41 pmmov wwtp b variation of the hadv 40 41 to hfmg ratio was low with coefficients of variation covs for all markers at both wwtps below 22 enterovirus gc were less enriched with respect to hfmg than hadv 40 41 with mean log10 ratios ranging from 0 50 lachno3 wwtp b to 0 55 pmmov wwtp a variability in the ev to hfmgs ratio was also lower with covs across all markers and wwtps ranging from 8 5 pmmov wwtp a to 15 1 lachno3 wwtp a human noroviruses gi gii demonstrated a ratio to hfmgs similar to that of ev with means from 0 51 to 0 59 log10 gc log10 gc of various marker genes however the variation in the hnov gi gii to marker ratios was greater with covs from 14 to 23 3 which is more similar with the variation observed for the hadv 40 41 to hfmgs ratios as illustrated in fig 2 the ratios between log10 transformed pathogenic virus gc and hfmgs demonstrated similar central tendency and variability for the same combinations between wwtp a and wwtp b with no statistically significant differences observed between the two plants p 0 05 as determined from kruskal wallis one way anova 3 7 probability distribution functions of human fecal marker genes and pathogenic viruses in untreated wastewater for qmra analysis we determine probability distribution functions pdfs of pathogenic viruses based on gc numbers as shown in supplementary table st7 gc l concentrations in wastewater from both wwtps were most often best fit by lognormal pdfs except for hnov gi gii gc l at wwtp b which was best fit by a gumbel maximum distribution the gumbel maximum distribution also known as the extreme value type i distribution is fully parameterized by a location referred to as likeliest in crystal ball and scale gumbel 1935 for hnov gi gii at wwtp b the best fit location parameter was 2 34 105 and the scale parameter indicative of variation was 3 32 105 although the gumbel maximum distribution minimized the value of the anderson darling test statistic the fit was not statistically acceptable p 0 05 the lognormal pdf which best fit all other virus gc l concentrations is fully characterized by two parameters the mean and standard deviation additionally each of the lognormal pdfs described in supplementary table st7 are also characterized by truncation at zero location parameter in crystal ball so as not to produce negative values it should be noted that the lognormal distribution best fit was not statistically acceptable p 0 05 for hnov gi gii at both wwtps and hadv 40 41 at wwtp b anderson darling test statistic values p values and pdf parameters are tabulated for each virus at wwtp a and b in supplementary table st7 pdfs were also fitted to the ratios of each hfmg and pathogenic virus gc for each wwtp supplementary table st8 the observed ratios between log10 gc numbers of hfmgs and pathogenic viruses were best fit by a variety of pdfs including weibull beta lognormal uniform triangular and maximum and minimum extreme although sometimes these fits were not statistically significant for 5 of 24 fits across both wwtps the heterogeneity observed between the type and fit of the pdfs within and between wwtps demonstrates that such observations can vary from site to site 4 discussion information on the concentration of hfmgs and pathogenic virus gc in untreated wastewater is important because such information can be used to extrapolate potential human health risks in fecally polluted water studies have determined the concentrations of hf183 crassphage lachno3 and pmmov marker genes in untreated wastewater samples mayer et al 2018 ahmed et al 2019 holm et al 2022 however a yearlong spatial survey of untreated wastewater for hf183 lachno3 crassphage and pmmov has not previously been conducted while a few studies have determined the concentrations of hadv ev and hnov in untreated wastewater in japan katayama et al 2008 usa montazeri et al 2015 australia lun et al 2019 italy la rosa et al 2010 little has been documented regarding the comparative analysis of hfmg and gc of pathogenic viruses in untreated wastewater the motivation of this study stemmed from our previous studies where we demonstrated the presence of wastewater pollution by analysing hf183 lachno3 crassphage and pmmov marker genes in estuarine waters in sydney impacted by wet weather overflows transported by urban stormwater runoff ahmed et al 2018b 2020 the concentrations of such hfmgs in environmental can be difficult to interpret by regulatory agencies and water quality managers regarding the pollution load and human health risk boehm et al 2015 therefore linking the concentrations of hfmgs with human health risk can be useful usepa 2012 previously we have reported that the concentrations of hf183 and crassphage marker genes collected during storm events exceeded the risk benchmark value for primary recreation in 50 and 43 of estuarine water samples respectively ahmed et al 2020 however this estimation was based on the risk benchmark threshold developed in specific geographical areas based on several key assumptions and may not provide accurate risk predictions in all estuarine waters in sydney australia one notable limitation is the concentrations of hfmgs and pathogenic viral gc in untreated wastewater in australia may exhibit temporal and spatial variations for this study we chose two wwtps with varying numbers of service population cover to determine the variability in the concentrations of hfmgs and pathogenic virus gc the intent was to collect a monthly sample over 12 months from each wwtp however collecting a monthly sample faced some roadblocks due to wet weather conditions and covid 19 lockdown that began in the early march 2020 monthly wastewater samples could not be collected in february march may and june 2020 to compensate for the data gaps two additional sampling events were conducted in january august and september 2020 respectively in this study grab spot sampling was used for wastewater sampling at a single point of time mostly during the peak wastewater flow composite samplers have not been installed at the study wwtps grab sampling is a common practice in the absence of expensive autosamplers for quantifying hfmgs and pathogenic virus gc in wastewater fong et al 2010 fumian et al 2019 ahmed et al 2021b while we acknowledge that such sampling approach may be inadequate for detection of low levels of viruses in untreated wastewater due to diurnal variations ahmed et al 2021b however the hfmgs and potential pathogenic viruses were selected for this study are present at moderate to high concentrations in untreated wastewater and therefore did not pose any methodological challenges for hfmgs and gc of pathogenic viruses we used an ae method which is capable of concentrating viruses and bacteria simultaneously from water and wastewater samples ahmed et al 2015a we acknowledge that the recovery of ae method may vary depending on the target microorganisms and the wastewater characteristics determining recovery efficiencies of endogenous hfmgs already present in wastewater was not within the scope of this study recovery efficiencies of the ae method has been reported to be 5 to 70 and therefore the actual concentrations of hfmgs and pathogenic virus gc in wastewater samples are greater than that reported in this study ahmed et al 2015a 2021c we also selected hfmgs with high host sensitivity and specificity values host specificity values which were not assessed in this study is particularly important for qmra model parameters zhang et al 2019 both hfmgs and viral pathogens must exhibit high host association so that hfmgs can be used as a proxy to determine the risk associated with viruses specific to untreated wastewater hfmgs that exhibit low host specificity in qmra analysis likely to overestimate the risk from a specific source and therefore provide risk estimates with increased uncertainty hf183 marker gene selected in this study have been rigorously evaluated by many studies ahmed et al 2016 crassphage marker gene selected in this study showed 100 host specificity in thailand sangkaew et al 2021 98 in australia ahmed et al 2019 and 98 6 in usa stachler et al 2017 the high host specificity values of pmmov marker gene have been reported in new zealand gyawali et al 2019 and usa rosario et al 2009 lachno3 marker gene revealed 95 host specificity in australia but the performance was inferior in thailand at present there is no benchmark criteria for host specificity value however a host specificity value of 0 90 is considered excellent ahmed et al 2016 boehm et al 2013 the concentrations of hfmgs were 3 4 orders of magnitude greater than pathogenic virus gc because hfmgs are shed by many individuals at high concentrations compared to the pathogenic virus gc which are shed by only infected individuals and depends on disease severity and the circulation in the community the concentration of lachno3 marker gene was the greatest in untreated wastewater samples from both wwtp a and b such findings corroborate with previous studies reporting slightly greater concentrations of lachno3 marker gene compared to crassphage and hf183 ahmed et al 2019 feng et al 2018 overall the concentrations of hfmgs reported in this study are similar to those ones reported in published literature suggesting the widespread presence of these marker genes in both populations serviced by these two wwtps ahmed et al 2018b olds et al 2018 sercu et al 2011 however marker gene concentrations variations were observed among biological replicate samples and between sampling events this could be attributed to several factors such as variation in recovery efficiencies wastewater sampling time i e peak flow vs normal flow efficiency of qpcr and rt qpcr and shedding dynamics of individuals notably the hf183 concentrations were lower in wastewater samples that had been collected during the covid 19 lockdown which commenced 31st of march 2020 in nsw it is not clear how restricted movement of people impacts hf183 concentrations in wastewater samples however such patterns were not observed for lachno3 crassphage and pmmov marker genes the marker gene concentrations were similar between two wwtps despite the contrasting service population sizes suggesting people consistently shed these marker genes in their feces most of the studies in the research literature determined the concentrations of broad spectrum of hadv i e species a f using pcr but little has been documented on the concentrations of enteric hadv 40 41 the mean concentration gc of hadv 40 41 over the twelve sampling events was greater than ev and combined hnov gi gii in wwtp a however in wwtp b the mean concentration of hadv 40 41 was slightly lower than hnov gi gii but greater than ev katayama et al 2008 reported that hadv i e broad range concentrations in the influent of a wwtp in japan was greater than those of hnov and ev in this study hadv 40 41 was observed throughout the sampling period hadv 40 and 41 primarily affect young children less than two years of age and the infections occur throughout the year hadv 40 41 showed some seasonal patterns less gc were detected in winter but it is not clear if this phenomenon is due to covid 19 lockdown in the study catchments in general the concentrations of ev in the wastewater samples were similar to hewitt et al 2011 reported for multiple wwtp in which ev concentrations ranged from 2 80 to 6 70 log10 gc l in the influent ev concentrations gc were greater in the beginning of summer and then declined which somewhat corroborate epidemiological studies of ev infection cases in the usa increasing during summer and fall with a peak in august khetsuriani et al 2006 in this study hnov gii was more prevalent 36 36 samples positive than hnov gi 18 36 samples positive for wwtp b and 15 36 samples positive for wwtp b which corroborates previous studies that reported hnov gii more frequently present in wastewater than hnov gi yan et al 2003 lodder and de roda husman 2005 we did not observe pronounced seasonal variations in hnov gi gii concentrations although hnov gi gii concentrations were less in april and in the beginning of august this difference might be attributed to the epidemiological conditions of the study catchments or the dilution of hnov gi gii and or restricted movement of people due to covid 19 lockdown in this study the correlations between hfmgs and pathogenic virus gc in untreated wastewater samples were determined these are particularly important for establishing the fact that the concentrations of hfmgs can predict the concentrations of pathogenic viruses while hf183 crassphage and pmmov correlated well with pathogenic virus gc in both wwtps lachno3 showed little or no correlations with gc of pathogenic viruses owing to resource limitations and for methodological convenience qmra of waterborne disease have frequently used measurements of hfmgs and previously observed pathogen to marker ratios to characterize health risks associated with exposure to recreational waters soller et al 2010 ahmed et al 2018a mcginnis et al 2022 in the current study ratios between pathogenic virus gc and hfmgs were comparable between two australian wwtps suggesting that such ratios may be a reliable basis for risk assessment of recreational waters contaminated with human feces especially for sewer overflow scenario in general the variation observed in the ratio between pathogenic virus gc and each hfmg was low cov 22 compared to the variation observed in the concentrations of each pathogenic virus gc in wastewater from each wwtp probability distribution functions fitted to observed concentrations of pathogenic virus gc in wastewater from each wwtp demonstrated right skew and large variation typical of microbial counts in aqueous matrices while these ratios are useful as input for qmra these functions are likely to produce risk distributions which may span many orders of magnitude despite the convenience of ratios we acknowledge an important source of bias in qmra models are the differential decay rates of pathogens and makers after discharge into receiving surface waters boehm et al 2018 schoen et al 2020 the characterization of the fate and transport of both hmfg and waterborne pathogens following their discharge into surface waters and the fraction of infectious waterborne pathogens which is a key component of qmra remain key research gaps in the further refinement of risk assessment approaches zhang et al 2019 5 conclusions in this study the mean concentrations of lachno3 marker gene was the greatest in untreated wastewater samples followed by crassphage hf183 and pmmov in both wwtps the concentrations of marker genes were quite stable over the course of the study with little variations observed within and between wwtps the concentrations gc of pathogenic viruses were 3 5 orders of magnitude lower than hfmgs and ranged from 4 75 to 5 09 log10 gc l of wastewater concentrations of enteric viruses were highly variable over the course of the study suggesting variable prevalence of the diseases in the community among the hfmgs hf183 crassphage and pmmov correlated well with pathogenic virus gc whereas weak or negative correlations were observed between lachno3 and pathogenic virus gc hadv 40 41 gc proportion was consistent with hfmgs compared to ev and hnov gi gii the ratios between log10 transformed pathogenic virus gc and hfmgs demonstrated similar central tendency and variability for the same combinations between wwtp a and wwtp b with no difference between the wwtps probability distribution functions pdfs generated for hfmgs and pathogenic virus gc

human adenovirus 40 41 hadv 40 41 human norovirus gi gii hnov gi gii and enterovirus ev were measured in untreated wastewater samples collected over a period of 12 months from two wastewater treatment plants in sydney australia using quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr and reverse transcription qpcr rt qpcr over the course of the study the gc of potential pathogenic viruses were 3 5 orders of magnitude lower than hfmgs in untreated wastewater the gc of pathogenic viruses were highly variable over the course of the study which contrasted with the concentrations of hfmgs that were quite stable with little variation observed within and between wwtps among the hfmgs hf183 crassphage and pmmov correlated well with pathogenic virus gc whereas weak or negative correlations were observed between lachno3 and pathogenic virus gc while the two assessed wwtps had dissimilar population service sizes the ratios between log10 transformed pathogenic virus gc and hfmgs demonstrated similar central tendency and variability for the same combinations between wwtp a and wwtp b with no difference between the wwtps this suggests the widespread presence of these hfmgs in both populations serviced by these two wwtps the observed correlation and ratios of hfmgs and gc of reference pathogenic viruses can contribute to improved qmra of human health risks in environmental waters subject to fresh sewer overflows graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fecal pollution mst marker gene wastewater viruses data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction fecal contamination of aquatic environments is one of the major water quality issues worldwide an et al 2020 wang et al 2022 various point and non point sources such as wastewater discharges caused by wet weather infiltration and inflow stormwater and dry weather overflows industrial effluents and feces from animals such as dogs cattle and wildlife can increase the load of fecal contamination by orders of magnitude in environmental waters olds et al 2018 senkbeil et al 2019 franklin et al 2020 mckee et al 2021 between animal and human fecal contamination sources human wastewater poses a greater risk to human health due to the presence of pathogenic viruses such as human norovirus hnov enterovirus ev and human adenovirus hadv among others fong et al 2005 soller et al 2010 rodríguez lázaro et al 2012 corpuz et al 2020 however the impairment of water quality is generally assessed by monitoring fecal indicator bacteria fib such as escherichia coli and enterococcus spp using culture based methods usepa 1986a 1986b 2012 fujioka et al 2015 fib are highly abundant in the feces of humans and animals and generally co occur with pathogens therefore the presence of fib in environmental waters indicates the potential presence of pathogens and potential human health risks fib monitoring is widely used for regulatory purposes however there are known limitations such as the exceedance of fib above recommended guidelines not always correlating with the presence of pathogens for which they proxy for lemarchand and lebaron 2003 harwood et al 2005 ortega et al 2009 inactivation rates of fib in aquatic environments may be different than those of pathogens ahmed et al 2021a and under favourable conditions certain strains of fib can replicate in beach sands halliday and gast 2011 soil ishii et al 2006 surface waters whitman et al 2006 and plants wright et al 2017 most importantly the presence of fib in an aquatic environment provides no information as to the specific contamination source given fib are present in the feces of all animals ahmed et al 2016 for the remediation of polluted water bodies to achieve their designated use it is vital for water utilities and regulators to identify the source s of the fecal contamination this can be accomplished using microbial source tracking mst techniques that identify and quantify the magnitude of fecal pollution in environmental waters stoeckel and harwood 2007 mst is an important tool for water quality managers and utilities to target areas where remediation works are required in the catchment the past several decades many mst marker genes have been identified and quantitative pcr qpcr assays developed for a range of fecal input sources from human cattle pig dog chicken seagull possum and other animals reviewed in harwood et al 2014 many laboratory and field studies have shown that analyses of these marker gene s can be used to identify sources of fecal contamination in environmental water samples with a high degree of accuracy and precision feng et al 2018 shanks et al 2012 another important application of mst marker genes is their association with human health risk outcomes several proof of concept studies have established a link between mst marker genes and pathogen risks in environmental waters ahmed et al 2018a boehm et al 2018 staley et al 2012 symonds et al 2016 in most of these studies concentrations of human fecal marker genes hfmgs were linked to reference viral pathogen s in a hypothetical waterbody impacted by untreated wastewater the concentration of mst marker genes corresponding to the united states environmental protection agency usepa recreational water quality criteria rwqc risk benchmarks were then used to compute a concentration below which there would be a sufficiently low health risk for primary contact recreational activities using quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra usepa 2012 moreover mst markers have also been used to calibrate catchment based hydrological pathogen fate and transport model into qmra for flood plains and river systems in austria derx et al 2016 2021 these approaches are attractive water quality management tools however there are several improvements that need to be incorporated for accurate qmra analysis these include the lack of appropriate dose response models accounting for differences among exposed populations the ratio of infectious vs non infectious pathogens incorporation of marker gene and pathogen loss through sample processing steps and understanding the decay and dilution patterns of these marker genes and pathogens in receiving waters ahmed et al 2019 while the concentrations of mst marker genes are expected to be more consistent in untreated wastewater viral pathogens such as hnov hadv 40 41 ev and other viruses will exhibit temporal and spatial variations associated with their varying prevalence in the community nordgren et al 2009 ahmed et al 2021b furthermore little has been documented on the concentrations of viral pathogens in untreated wastewater samples especially in australia and the ratio between hfmgs and gene copies gc of potential viral pathogens such information is important for improved qmra of sewer overflows utilizing hfmgs ahmed et al 2020 the aims of this study were to i measure the concentrations of four hfmgs bacteroides hf183 lachnospiraceae lachno3

wwtp a and b hereafter located in temperate climatic zone sydney nsw australia were selected for this study supplementary table st1 wwtp a is in north bondi 33 884579 151 284118 and treats wastewater from approximately 500 000 residents living from bondi to rozelle as well as sydney s central business district wwtp a receives wastewater from a catchment of approximately 3 800 hectares the treatment process consists of a primary treatment screening grit and sedimentation processes prior to discharge 2 to 3 km offshore of the wwtp into the tasman sea via a deep water ocean outfall diffuser array besley and birch 2019 wwtp b is in cronulla 34 031228 151 163929 and treats wastewater from approximately 266 000 people wastewater is collected and transported to the wwtp via approximately 1 405 km of trunk gravity sewers with two main carriers the port hacking submain and the sutherland submain wwtp b consists of primary screening grit and sedimentation processes secondary activated sludge process and tertiary dual media filtration treatment followed by uv disinfection prior to nearshore discharge of the wastewater into the tasman sea triplicate grab spot wastewater samples approximately 500 ml were collected in sterile pet bottles with thiosulfate from the influent of each wwtp using an autosampler with peristaltic pump samples were collected within 5 min of each other wastewater samples were collected over a period of 12 months from september 2019 to late september 2020 in total 36 samples were collected from each wwtp over 12 sampling events yielding a total of 72 wastewater samples from wwtp a and b samples were transported on ice to the laboratory and stored at 4 c up to 24 h before concentration step took place 2 2 fib enumeration

pathogenic viruses hnov gi and gii in untreated wastewater samples were not normally distributed as determined by a shapiro wilk normality test as a matter of convenience concentrations of hfmgs and pathogenic virus gc were log10 transformed before statistical analyses the mean ranks of hfmgs and pathogenic virus gc concentrations in untreated wastewater at each wwtp were compared using a kruskal wallis h test with dunn s post hoc test for multiple comparisons kruskal and wallis 1952 dunn 1964 the strength of the association between hfmgs and pathogenic virus gc concentrations in untreated wastewater at each wwtp was assessed by spearman rank correlation with a two tailed p value spearman 1904 in general r 0 7 was considered a strong positive correlation r 0 4 but 0 7 was moderate correlation and r 0 2 but 0 4 was weak correlation ahmed et al 2015b unpaired t tests were performed to compare the mean concentrations of hfmgs and pathogenic virus gc between wwtp a and b statistical significance was defined as p 0 05 and graphpad prism version 8 3 1 was used for statistical analysis graphpad software inc la jolla ca usa probability distribution functions pdfs were fit to the observed gc of pathogenic viruses at each individual wwtp n 36 using crystal ball release 11 1 2 4 900 oracle corporation austin tx usa gumple 1935 goodness of fit was assessed for a test pool of twenty different pdfs with the best fit selected as the one which yielded the lowest value of the anderson darling test statistic anderson and darling 1952 stephens 1979 the anderson darling test makes use of a quadratic empirical distribution function to measure the distance between a modelled distribution function and the empirical distribution of the data the best fit pdfs along with the anderson darling test statistic value and resulting p value were tabulated for each marker gene and virus gc in wastewater the best fit was considered statistically acceptable if the p value was 0 05

wastewater in wwtp a supplementary table st3 the concentrations of e coli and enterococci in wwtp b were similar to wwtp a ranging from 6 68 to 7 26 log10 cfu of e coli and 5 67 to 6 52 log10 cfu enterococci 100 ml the mean concentrations of e coli in untreated wastewater samples were significantly p 0 0001 different than enterococci for both wwtps 3 2 qpcr and rt qpcr performance

standard curves ranged between 3 15 crassphage cpq 056 and 3 34 both hnov gi and gii assays supplementary table st4 the ranges for amplification efficiencies 99 3 to 108 and y intercepts 35 4 to 39 8 were within the prescribed range of miqe guidelines bustin et al 2009 the correlation coefficients r2 ranged from 0 97 to 0 99 for all qpcr and rt qpcr assays all positive controls or standard curve materials amplified in each pcr qpcr rt pcr and rt qpcr run 3 3 alod and pcr inhibition the alods for the qpcr and rt qpcr assays were between 5 80 and 21 7 gc reaction being the lowest for the pmmov and greatest for hnov gi assays respectively supplementary table st4 all wastewater nucleic acid samples were within the 2 cq values of the reference cq value thus no qpcr inhibition was identified supplementary fig sf1 3 4 concentrations of hfmgs and pathogenic viruses in untreated wastewater the concentrations of hfmgs hf183 lachno3 crassphage pmmov were greater than the qpcr and rt qpcr alod the gc of hadv 40 41 hnov gii and ev were greater than the rt qpcr alod however for hnov gi only 33 of 72 wastewater samples had gc greater than the alod gc of hnov gi and gii were combined i e hnov gi gii by summing respective gc numbers the pooled concentrations of hfmgs and pathogenic virus gc in untreated wastewater samples over 12 sampling events are shown in fig 1 in a box and whisker plot format supplementary fig sf2 sf8 are showing the concentrations of hfmgs and potential pathogenic virus gc in each sampling event during the study among the four hfmgs the mean lachno3 concentrations were the highest 9 47 log10 gc l in untreated wastewater samples from wwtp a followed by crassphage 9 13 log10 gc l hf183 9 09 log10 gc l and pmmov 8 54 log10 gc l the mean gc of hadv 5 09 log10 gc l hnov gi gii 4 86 log10 gc l and ev 4 76 log10 gc l were 4 to 5 orders of magnitude lower than those hfmgs similar trends were also observed for wastewater samples collected from wwtp b descriptive statistics are presented in table 1 the kruskal wallis one way anova was conducted to determine if there are any significant differences in the hfmgs and pathogenic virus gc from each wwtp dunn s multiple comparisons test indicated that the concentrations of hfmgs did not differ significantly from each other except lachno3 and pmmov concentrations were significantly different p 0 0032 from each other in untreated wastewater samples collected from wwtp a supplementary table st5 gc concentrations of each and all pathogenic viruses were significantly different p 0 0001 than hfmgs similar results were also observed for wwtp b except lachno3 and pmmov concentrations were significantly different p 0 0017 from each other in addition to crassphage and pmmov supplementary table st6 an additional kruskal wallis one way anova indicated the mean concentrations of hfmgs and pathogenic virus gc in untreated wastewater samples from wwtp a did not differ significantly p 0 05 from wwtp b 3 5 correlation between hfmgs and gc of pathogenic viruses there were significant correlations between hfmgs and pathogenic virus gc at both wwtp a and wwtp b represented in the spearman rank order correlation matrix table 2 among the 21 bivariate comparisons at each location there were 14 66 statistically significant correlations at wwtp a and 17 81 at wwtp b there were strong positive correlations at wwtp a r 0 7 between hf183 and hadv 40 41 r 0 788 and ev r 0 702 respectively and at wwtp b there was strong positive correlation between hf183 and hnov gi gii hf183 positively correlated with all hfmgs and pathogenic viruses except lachno3 for both wwtps lachno3 only correlated with crassphage in wwtp a and crassphage and hnov gi gii in wwtp b crassphage correlated with hadv 40 41 and hnov gi and gii in wwtp a and all three pathogenic viruses in wwtp b pmmov also correlated with all three pathogenic viruses in both wwtp a and b significant correlations were also observed among three pathogenic virus gc in both wwtps table 2 these results suggest that viral hfmgs such as crassphage and pmmov exhibit more consistent and stronger quantitative relationships with viral pathogens than hf183 and lachno3 and would therefore by more relevant for risk assessments performed via hfmg measurements and application of pathogens to hfmgs ratios 3 6 ratio between hfmgs and pathogenic virus gc in untreated wastewater box and whisker plots of the ratio of log10 transformed gc of each pathogenic virus to each hfmg at both wwtp a and wwtp b are illustrated in fig 2 while log10 gc ratios at each wwtp are illustrated in sf9 hf183 sf10 lachno3 sf11 crassphage and sf12 pmmov on a log10 ratio basis hadv 40 41 was consistently the most enriched i e the proportion increased compared to other pathogenic viruses pathogen relative to each hfmgs with mean log10 ratios at each wwtp ranging from 0 68 hadv 40 41 lachno3 wwtp a to 0 77 hadv 40 41 pmmov wwtp b variation of the hadv 40 41 to hfmg ratio was low with coefficients of variation covs for all markers at both wwtps below 22 enterovirus gc were less enriched with respect to hfmg than hadv 40 41 with mean log10 ratios ranging from 0 50 lachno3 wwtp b to 0 55 pmmov wwtp a variability in the ev to hfmgs ratio was also lower with covs across all markers and wwtps ranging from 8 5 pmmov wwtp a to 15 1 lachno3 wwtp a human noroviruses gi gii demonstrated a ratio to hfmgs similar to that of ev with means from 0 51 to 0 59 log10 gc log10 gc of various marker genes however the variation in the hnov gi gii to marker ratios was greater with covs from 14 to 23 3 which is more similar with the variation observed for the hadv 40 41 to hfmgs ratios as illustrated in fig 2 the ratios between log10 transformed pathogenic virus gc and hfmgs demonstrated similar central tendency and variability for the same combinations between wwtp a and wwtp b with no statistically significant differences observed between the two plants p 0 05 as determined from kruskal wallis one way anova 3 7 probability distribution functions of human fecal marker genes and pathogenic viruses in untreated wastewater for qmra analysis we determine probability distribution functions pdfs of pathogenic viruses based on gc numbers as shown in supplementary table st7 gc l concentrations in wastewater from both wwtps were most often best fit by lognormal pdfs except for hnov gi gii gc l at wwtp b which was best fit by a gumbel maximum distribution the gumbel maximum distribution also known as the extreme value type i distribution is fully parameterized by a location referred to as likeliest in crystal ball and scale gumbel 1935 for hnov gi gii at wwtp b the best fit location parameter was 2 34 105 and the scale parameter indicative of variation was 3 32 105 although the gumbel maximum distribution minimized the value of the anderson darling test statistic the fit was not statistically acceptable p 0 05 the lognormal pdf which best fit all other virus gc l concentrations is fully characterized by two parameters the mean and standard deviation additionally each of the lognormal pdfs described in supplementary table st7 are also characterized by truncation at zero location parameter in crystal ball so as not to produce negative values it should be noted that the lognormal distribution best fit was not statistically acceptable p 0 05 for hnov gi gii at both wwtps and hadv 40 41 at wwtp b anderson darling test statistic values p values and pdf parameters are tabulated for each virus at wwtp a and b in supplementary table st7 pdfs were also fitted to the ratios of each hfmg and pathogenic virus gc for each wwtp supplementary table st8 the observed ratios between log10 gc numbers of hfmgs and pathogenic viruses were best fit by a variety of pdfs including weibull beta lognormal uniform triangular and maximum and minimum extreme although sometimes these fits were not statistically significant for 5 of 24 fits across both wwtps the heterogeneity observed between the type and fit of the pdfs within and between wwtps demonstrates that such observations can vary from site to site 4 discussion information on the concentration of hfmgs and pathogenic virus gc in untreated wastewater is important because such information can be used to extrapolate potential human health risks in fecally polluted water studies have determined the concentrations of hf183 crassphage lachno3 and pmmov marker genes in untreated wastewater samples mayer et al 2018 ahmed et al 2019 holm et al 2022 however a yearlong spatial survey of untreated wastewater for hf183 lachno3 crassphage and pmmov has not previously been conducted while a few studies have determined the concentrations of hadv ev and hnov in untreated wastewater in japan katayama et al 2008 usa montazeri et al 2015 australia lun et al 2019 italy la rosa et al 2010 little has been documented regarding the comparative analysis of hfmg and gc of pathogenic viruses in untreated wastewater the motivation of this study stemmed from our previous studies where we demonstrated the presence of wastewater pollution by analysing hf183 lachno3 crassphage and pmmov marker genes in estuarine waters in sydney impacted by wet weather overflows transported by urban stormwater runoff ahmed et al 2018b 2020 the concentrations of such hfmgs in environmental can be difficult to interpret by regulatory agencies and water quality managers regarding the pollution load and human health risk boehm et al 2015 therefore linking the concentrations of hfmgs with human health risk can be useful usepa 2012 previously we have reported that the concentrations of hf183 and crassphage marker genes collected during storm events exceeded the risk benchmark value for primary recreation in 50 and 43 of estuarine water samples respectively ahmed et al 2020 however this estimation was based on the risk benchmark threshold developed in specific geographical areas based on several key assumptions and may not provide accurate risk predictions in all estuarine waters in sydney australia one notable limitation is the concentrations of hfmgs and pathogenic viral gc in untreated wastewater in australia may exhibit temporal and spatial variations for this study we chose two wwtps with varying numbers of service population cover to determine the variability in the concentrations of hfmgs and pathogenic virus gc the intent was to collect a monthly sample over 12 months from each wwtp however collecting a monthly sample faced some roadblocks due to wet weather conditions and covid 19 lockdown that began in the early march 2020 monthly wastewater samples could not be collected in february march may and june 2020 to compensate for the data gaps two additional sampling events were conducted in january august and september 2020 respectively in this study grab spot sampling was used for wastewater sampling at a single point of time mostly during the peak wastewater flow composite samplers have not been installed at the study wwtps grab sampling is a common practice in the absence of expensive autosamplers for quantifying hfmgs and pathogenic virus gc in wastewater fong et al 2010 fumian et al 2019 ahmed et al 2021b while we acknowledge that such sampling approach may be inadequate for detection of low levels of viruses in untreated wastewater due to diurnal variations ahmed et al 2021b however the hfmgs and potential pathogenic viruses were selected for this study are present at moderate to high concentrations in untreated wastewater and therefore did not pose any methodological challenges for hfmgs and gc of pathogenic viruses we used an ae method which is capable of concentrating viruses and bacteria simultaneously from water and wastewater samples ahmed et al 2015a we acknowledge that the recovery of ae method may vary depending on the target microorganisms and the wastewater characteristics determining recovery efficiencies of endogenous hfmgs already present in wastewater was not within the scope of this study recovery efficiencies of the ae method has been reported to be 5 to 70 and therefore the actual concentrations of hfmgs and pathogenic virus gc in wastewater samples are greater than that reported in this study ahmed et al 2015a 2021c we also selected hfmgs with high host sensitivity and specificity values host specificity values which were not assessed in this study is particularly important for qmra model parameters zhang et al 2019 both hfmgs and viral pathogens must exhibit high host association so that hfmgs can be used as a proxy to determine the risk associated with viruses specific to untreated wastewater hfmgs that exhibit low host specificity in qmra analysis likely to overestimate the risk from a specific source and therefore provide risk estimates with increased uncertainty hf183 marker gene selected in this study have been rigorously evaluated by many studies ahmed et al 2016 crassphage marker gene selected in this study showed 100 host specificity in thailand sangkaew et al 2021 98 in australia ahmed et al 2019 and 98 6 in usa stachler et al 2017 the high host specificity values of pmmov marker gene have been reported in new zealand gyawali et al 2019 and usa rosario et al 2009 lachno3 marker gene revealed 95 host specificity in australia but the performance was inferior in thailand at present there is no benchmark criteria for host specificity value however a host specificity value of 0 90 is considered excellent ahmed et al 2016 boehm et al 2013 the concentrations of hfmgs were 3 4 orders of magnitude greater than pathogenic virus gc because hfmgs are shed by many individuals at high concentrations compared to the pathogenic virus gc which are shed by only infected individuals and depends on disease severity and the circulation in the community the concentration of lachno3 marker gene was the greatest in untreated wastewater samples from both wwtp a and b such findings corroborate with previous studies reporting slightly greater concentrations of lachno3 marker gene compared to crassphage and hf183 ahmed et al 2019 feng et al 2018 overall the concentrations of hfmgs reported in this study are similar to those ones reported in published literature suggesting the widespread presence of these marker genes in both populations serviced by these two wwtps ahmed et al 2018b olds et al 2018 sercu et al 2011 however marker gene concentrations variations were observed among biological replicate samples and between sampling events this could be attributed to several factors such as variation in recovery efficiencies wastewater sampling time i e peak flow vs normal flow efficiency of qpcr and rt qpcr and shedding dynamics of individuals notably the hf183 concentrations were lower in wastewater samples that had been collected during the covid 19 lockdown which commenced 31st of march 2020 in nsw it is not clear how restricted movement of people impacts hf183 concentrations in wastewater samples however such patterns were not observed for lachno3 crassphage and pmmov marker genes the marker gene concentrations were similar between two wwtps despite the contrasting service population sizes suggesting people consistently shed these marker genes in their feces most of the studies in the research literature determined the concentrations of broad spectrum of hadv i e species a f using pcr but little has been documented on the concentrations of enteric hadv 40 41 the mean concentration gc of hadv 40 41 over the twelve sampling events was greater than ev and combined hnov gi gii in wwtp a however in wwtp b the mean concentration of hadv 40 41 was slightly lower than hnov gi gii but greater than ev katayama et al 2008 reported that hadv i e broad range concentrations in the influent of a wwtp in japan was greater than those of hnov and ev in this study hadv 40 41 was observed throughout the sampling period hadv 40 and 41 primarily affect young children less than two years of age and the infections occur throughout the year hadv 40 41 showed some seasonal patterns less gc were detected in winter but it is not clear if this phenomenon is due to covid 19 lockdown in the study catchments in general the concentrations of ev in the wastewater samples were similar to hewitt et al 2011 reported for multiple wwtp in which ev concentrations ranged from 2 80 to 6 70 log10 gc l in the influent ev concentrations gc were greater in the beginning of summer and then declined which somewhat corroborate epidemiological studies of ev infection cases in the usa increasing during summer and fall with a peak in august khetsuriani et al 2006 in this study hnov gii was more prevalent 36 36 samples positive than hnov gi 18 36 samples positive for wwtp b and 15 36 samples positive for wwtp b which corroborates previous studies that reported hnov gii more frequently present in wastewater than hnov gi yan et al 2003 lodder and de roda husman 2005 we did not observe pronounced seasonal variations in hnov gi gii concentrations although hnov gi gii concentrations were less in april and in the beginning of august this difference might be attributed to the epidemiological conditions of the study catchments or the dilution of hnov gi gii and or restricted movement of people due to covid 19 lockdown in this study the correlations between hfmgs and pathogenic virus gc in untreated wastewater samples were determined these are particularly important for establishing the fact that the concentrations of hfmgs can predict the concentrations of pathogenic viruses while hf183 crassphage and pmmov correlated well with pathogenic virus gc in both wwtps lachno3 showed little or no correlations with gc of pathogenic viruses owing to resource limitations and for methodological convenience qmra of waterborne disease have frequently used measurements of hfmgs and previously observed pathogen to marker ratios to characterize health risks associated with exposure to recreational waters soller et al 2010 ahmed et al 2018a mcginnis et al 2022 in the current study ratios between pathogenic virus gc and hfmgs were comparable between two australian wwtps suggesting that such ratios may be a reliable basis for risk assessment of recreational waters contaminated with human feces especially for sewer overflow scenario in general the variation observed in the ratio between pathogenic virus gc and each hfmg was low cov 22 compared to the variation observed in the concentrations of each pathogenic virus gc in wastewater from each wwtp probability distribution functions fitted to observed concentrations of pathogenic virus gc in wastewater from each wwtp demonstrated right skew and large variation typical of microbial counts in aqueous matrices while these ratios are useful as input for qmra these functions are likely to produce risk distributions which may span many orders of magnitude despite the convenience of ratios we acknowledge an important source of bias in qmra models are the differential decay rates of pathogens and makers after discharge into receiving surface waters boehm et al 2018 schoen et al 2020 the characterization of the fate and transport of both hmfg and waterborne pathogens following their discharge into surface waters and the fraction of infectious waterborne pathogens which is a key component of qmra remain key research gaps in the further refinement of risk assessment approaches zhang et al 2019 5 conclusions in this study the mean concentrations of lachno3 marker gene was the greatest in untreated wastewater samples followed by crassphage hf183 and pmmov in both wwtps the concentrations of marker genes were quite stable over the course of the study with little variations observed within and between wwtps the concentrations gc of pathogenic viruses were 3 5 orders of magnitude lower than hfmgs and ranged from 4 75 to 5 09 log10 gc l of wastewater concentrations of enteric viruses were highly variable over the course of the study suggesting variable prevalence of the diseases in the community among the hfmgs hf183 crassphage and pmmov correlated well with pathogenic virus gc whereas weak or negative correlations were observed between lachno3 and pathogenic virus gc hadv 40 41 gc proportion was consistent with hfmgs compared to ev and hnov gi gii the ratios between log10 transformed pathogenic virus gc and hfmgs demonstrated similar central tendency and variability for the same combinations between wwtp a and wwtp b with no difference between the wwtps probability distribution functions pdfs generated for hfmgs and pathogenic virus gc

phosphorus and other pollutants from the sediment into the water which will adversely deteriorate the water quality beutel et al 2008 wang et al 2012 up to now the phenomenon of mom has been reported in 51 lakes or reservoirs in 10 countries in 1957 shapiro 1960 reported the phenomenon of lower do in the metalimnion in lake washington usa which lasted for six months the existence of mom was also confirmed by cerco et al 2006 many studies have reported that mom mainly occurred at 5 to 40 m below the water surface and do concentration was mostly lower than 4 mg l which reached the lowest level or even anaerobic state from august to september effler et al 1998 kim and cho 1989 the depth of mom and the minimum do concentration varied greatly in different regions due to the water depth reservoir capacity terrain and climate conditions boyd 1980 in a word the metalimnion layer is characterized by hydrostatic pressure natural microbial consortium activity and lower do concentration which is extremely different from the condition of simulating surface water in the laboratory the formation of mom in reservoirs was due to both thermal stratification and cyanobacterial blooms merino ibarra et al 2008 thermal stratification was caused by the difference in water density with temperature at different water depths lee et al 2010 zhang et al 2014c the metalimnion was the layer between the upper continuously mixing epilimnion and the bottom hypolimnion wang et al 2017 yu et al 2010 the metalimnion with high density gradient would lead to the accumulation of declining algae in this area the respiration of algae cells in the metalimnion with low light intensity outcompeted their photosynthetic activity which resulted in the decay of algal cells and further led to the release of intracellular organic matter iom huang et al 2019b wentzky et al 2019 because of the oxygen consumption of metalimnion do was in a minimum state in some areas and even reached the anoxic and anaerobic level moreover the existence of high density gradient in the metalimnion prevented the transportation of do from the surface to the deep water region resulting in an anaerobic condition in the metalimnion zhang et al 2015 many water intake positions were usually located in the middle level namely near the metalimnion to avoid the plenty of algae in the surface water layer and anaerobic environment of the bottom therefore the influence of mom on the water quality of this layer is extremely important at present most studies focused on the effects of iom released by algae cells cultured in the laboratory and its derived disinfection by products dbps on water quality the undesirable iom was composed of numerous carbohydrates amino acids and proteinaceous compounds all of which were potential dbps precursors kralles et al 2020 li et al 2012 the transformation of iom and their derived dbps formation potential dbpfps in the mom zones lower do concentration dark pressure natural microbial consortium action activity is still unknown the transformed products may seriously deteriorate the raw water quality increasing the difficulty of subsequent water treatment processes and water supply risk noori et al 2021 however little attention has been paid to the change of iom under mom conditions the objectives of the study are 1 to investigate the change of iom by simulating mom conditions and its related dbpfps 2 to examine the relationship between iom and its related dbpfps under mom conditions 3 to explore the mechanisms of iom change and its related dbpfps by investigating the variation of microbial metabolic activity and community during the incubation 2 materials and methods 2 1 algal cultivation and iom isolation microcystic m aeruginosa was selected for this study because it was commonly found as a dominant blooming species in most lakes and reservoirs in china m aeruginosa was incubated in the modified bg 11 media in an incubator at 25 2 12 h light 12 h dark cycles li et al 2012 algal suspensions of the late stationary phase were centrifuged at 9600 rpm for 15 min followed by supernatant removal the centrifuged cells were firstly washed three times with 0 8 nacl and subsequently re suspended in milli q water for three freeze thawing cycles the supernatant was then centrifuged for 15 min at 9600 r min iom was obtained by passing the filtrate through 0 22 μm pre sterilized filter membranes daly et al 2007 gao et al 2015a 2 2 experimental procedures the experiments were carried out in a customized hermetic stainless steel container with a volume of 5 l fig 1 which consisted of a sampling port discharge valve pressure gage and nitrogen injection port inoculum water was collected in a sterile glass flask from a reservoir in xi an china returned to the laboratory and filtered through 5 μm pre sterilized filter membranes to remove grazers phytoplankton zooplankton and detritus the filtrate was then centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min pelletized natural microbial consortium was resuspended in the sterile medium to improve its yield for subsequent experiments phosphate buffer at a concentration of 1 mmol l as p was added to keep each solution at ph 7 0 0 2 during the incubation calcium chloride and magnesium chloride were added to achieve each initial concentration of 50 mg l as ca2 and mg2 the iom was the only source of nitrogen and carbon in each test with an initial doc concentration of 4 80 mg l the natural microbial consortium was put into the reaction system together with iom with an initial concentration of 3 0 107 cells ml the depths of metalimnetic were simulated by injecting nitrogen into the hermetic container to achieve different pressures the pressure setups were 0 1 0 3 0 5 and 0 8 mpa respectively to simulate water depths of 10 30 50 and 80 m 80 m depth referred to as the bottom hypolimnion since anoxic condition also appeared at the bottom of the reservoir 80 m was set only to study the effect of pressure on iom transformation under anoxic condition and all of the do concentration was approximately 0 5 mg l different do concentration were also set to simulate different mom conditions for test under anoxic condition high purity nitrogen 99 99 was continuously injected into certain container to maintain the initial do level about 0 5 mg l for test under aerobic condition air was continuously injected into container to maintain the initial do concentration about 3 0 mg l the pressure of aerobic and anoxic experimental setting was 0 3 mpa the experiment was lasted 14 days at room temperature 25 2 samples were collected every two days for analysis and the natural microbial consortium analyses were examined on 0 without inoculation and 14 days after different incubation time the 120 ml samples were taken to test the dbpfps water quality analysis and the cell counts and integrity of natural microbial consortium the 500 ml samples were collected before and after the experiment for microbial diversity tests each experimental condition performed three times independently and each sample was measured in three replicates 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 water quality analyses the doc was quantified using a toc analyzer toc l shimadzu japan the uv254 was determined by uv spectrophotometer uv2600a unico usa and the specific uv absorbance suva was calculated by the ratio of uv254 to doc the suva was used as a surrogate to indicate the aromatic substance weishaar et al 2003 the relative molecular size of iom was calculated as the ratio of absorption coefficient at wavelengths between 250 and 365 nm i e uv250 uv365 helms et al 2008 molecular weight decreased as the ratio increases all samples were filtered through 0 22 μm pre sterilized filter membranes prior to measurement 2 3 2 eem parafac analysis the excitation emission matrix fluorescence and parallel factor eem parafac analysis were useful in distinguishing organic matter structural characteristics and sources as well as realizing direct and rapid fluorescence quantitative analysis of multi components in complex systems in water ly et al 2019 the eem of water samples were recorded using a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi japan eems were acquired by scanning at 1 2000 nm min over emission em wavelengths ranging from 250 to 550 nm at 2 nm intervals and excitation ex wavelengths ranging from 220 to 420 nm at 5 nm intervals both em and ex slits were set as 5 nm in each sample an eem of a control milli q water was subtracted from eem to remove most of raman scatter peaks fluorescence data was modeled in matlab 7 0 software using the domfluor toolbox stedmon and bro 2008 split half analysis was used to determine numbers of components the sample specific maximum fluorescence fmax referred to the fluorescence intensity of the component output by the model reflecting the parafac component concentration in raman units ru component concentration increased as the fmax increased the bioavailability of organic matter depended not only on its size but also on its structural characteristics bittar et al 2015 the transformation of organic matter by natural microbial consortium could also be further explained by analyzing the changes of fmax of each component 2 3 3 flow cytometric measurements the membrane integrity and concentration of natural microbial consortium during incubation were measured with a flow cytometer accuri c6 bd usa the dye was sybr green і propidium iodide sg pi cao et al 2021 staining procedures were performed as follows 10 μl of sg pi were added to a 500 μl water sample which incubated at 35 for 20 min in dark wen et al 2020 more details on testing procedures could be obtained in our prior studies cao et al 2022 2 3 4 microbial metabolic

aerobic do 3 0 mg l conditions in 0 3 mpa biolog eco microplate eco microplate matrix technologies usa contained thirty one sole carbon sources including six types carbohydrates amino acids esters alcohols amines and carboxylic acids tab s1 the eco plates were cultured in darkness at 28 2 for 240 h and tested every 24 h with an elisa reader biolog ca usa the average well color development at 590 nm awcd 590nm was calculated using the data acquired at each time point as a measure of the metabolic activity of the natural microbial consortium zhang et al 2014b the awcd 590nm of each sample under 120 h of incubation time was selected to calculate the utilization efficiency of carbon sources stefanowicz 2006 2 3 5 microbial diversity analysis to analyze the natural microbial consortium structure samples were collected for the sequencing measurements after inoculation under different mom conditions each sample was filtered through 0 22 μm pre sterilized filter membranes samples filtered on the membranes were stored at 20 until test microbial dna was extracted and purified using the e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga u s the nanodrop 2000 uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific wilmington usa was used to determine the final dna concentration and purification the v3 v4 hypervariable regions of the bacteria 16s rrna gene were amplified with primers 338f actcctacgggaggcagcag and 806r ggactachvgggtwtctaat by thermocycler pcr system geneamp 9700 abi usa sequencing was on an illumina miseq platform illumina usa at major bio shanghai china 2 3 6 dbpfps analysis chlorination experiments were kept at 25 0 5 in the dark for 3 days using sealed 40 ml amber glass bottles under headspace free conditions the ph of solution was buffered at 7 0 0 2 with phosphate buffer prior to dbpfps tests the free chlorine dosages for dbpfps tests were determined by eq 1 krasner et al 2007 after 3 days reaction time the residual chlorine was quenched by na2s2o3 0 1 m and then extracted for dbpfps analysis the initial and residual chlorine concentration were measured using dpd spectrophotometry wan et al 2022 1 cl2 dosage mg l 3 doc mg c l 7 6 nh3 n mg n l 10 mg l analyses of dbpfps were completed by gas chromatography sp 3510 beifen ruili china with an electron capture detector gc ecd according to the usepa method 551 1 and usepa method 552 3 the used column was a kb 5 fused silica capillary column 30 m 0 32 mm i d with 0 50 μm film thickness the detailed information about the dbpfps analytical method was provided in tab s2 2 4 statistical analysis ibm spss statistics version 22 software was performed to evaluate if there was significant difference in the results suva uv250 uv365 fmax dbpfps concentration of samples under different mom conditions the t test was used to test the data redundancy analysis rda was used for assessing the correlation between the iom parameters and dbpfps canoco version 4 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 change of iom characteristics under different mom conditions 3 1 1 effect of pressure the characteristics of iom during the incubation under different pressure conditions are shown in fig 2 the doc fluctuated at the beginning of incubation period and then decreased by 35 5 under 0 3 mpa after 14 days of incubation the suva finally increased by 239 0 and the uv250 uv365 decreased by 35 5 the results implied that the proportion of aromatic compounds and the molecular size of organic matter gradually increased which was due to the preferential utilization of low molecular weight and non aromatic fractions of iom by natural microbial consortium liu et al 2021 wen et al 2019 the same change trends of the doc suva and uv250 uv365 were also observed under 0 1 mpa 0 5 mpa and 0 8 mpa fig 2 and fig s1 and there was no significant difference in the characteristics of iom under different pressure conditions fig s2 the change of fluorescent components of organic matter was analyzed by the eem parafac analysis fig 3 four different fluorescent components c1 c2 c3 c4 were identified and their eem contours ex em loadings and fluorescence peak positions are given in table 1 as shown in fig 3 under different pressure conditions total fmax increased by 53 3 80 2 within the first 4 days of incubation but then decreased slowly over the next 10 days fig 3 and fig s3 ultimately the total fmax decreased by 4 8 22 0 the increase of total fmax with the first 4 days was mainly attributed to the appearance of c1 and c2 substances which may be derived from the leakage of microbial intracellular substances such as tryptophan like substances or the products of microbial degradation of c3 substances jia and cui 2009 romera castillo et al 2011 in general the doc and total fmax of iom decreased to a certain extent under different pressure conditions but its aromaticity and molecular weight showed an increasing trend 3 1 2 effect of do the changes of iom incubation under anoxic or aerobic conditions are shown in fig 2 under aerobic condition the doc was degraded sharply to 1 90 mg l within the first 2 days and the degradation rate reached the maximum value of 60 4 however the doc decreased at 4th day and finally decreased by 35 5 under anoxic condition gao et al 2015b showed that the biodegradation of organic matter was affected by do doc concentration microbial activity cells abundance and so on the suva increased under different do conditions but after 10 days the suva decreased slightly to 0 83 l mg m under aerobic condition which was lower than that under anoxic condition t test p 0 075 additionally it was observed that uv250 uv365 increased slightly after 2 days under aerobic condition fig 2 b which may be due to the phenomenon that complex organic macromolecules and aromatic compounds could be degraded by some specific microbial community chen and hur 2015 as shown in fig 3 the change of total fmax followed a variation profile similar to that of doc under different do conditions under aerobic condition total fmax decreased rapidly from 1 47 to 0 90 ru within the first 2 days and finally stabilized at 0 80 ru among them the degradation efficiency of c1 and c2 was both significantly higher than that of c3 which was because that natural microbial consortium would give priority to tyrosine like proteins or tryptophan like proteins lee et al 2018 under anoxic condition the total fmax increased up to 2 26 ru firstly and then decreased to 1 38 ru which was still significantly higher than that under aerobic condition this phenomenon was due to the higher activity of natural microbial consortium under aerobic condition which could effectively degrade and utilize organic matter schram and marzolf 1994 therefore the water body should be maintained to an aerobic state to reduce the impact of mom on water quality 3 2 change of dbpfps derived from iom under different mom conditions the results of dbpfps derived from iom under different mom conditions are shown in fig 4 and fig s4 the dbpfps species of the water samples were chloroform formation potential tcmfp haloacetic acid formation potential haafps dichloroacetic acid formation potential dcaafp trichloroacetic acid formation potential tcaafp and dibromoacetic acid formation potential dbaafp haloketone formation potential hkfps 1 1 dichloro 2 propanone formation potential 1 1 dcpfp and 1 1 1 trichloro 2 propanone formation potential 1 1 1 tcpfp trichloronitromethane formation potential tcnmfp and dichloroacetonitrile formation potential dcanfp moreover the main two species were tcmfp and haafps which was in agreement with the results of huang et al 2019a as illustrated in fig 4 a the total dbpfps increased within the first 2 days and finally decreased by 26 2 33 1 under different pressure conditions the haafps had a similar pattern under different pressure conditions where the peak concentration of haafps were 42 1 125 6 higher than the initial concentration fig 4 b finally the haafps decreased by 26 5 30 5 the result of haafps was in consistent with the changes of c1 and c2 components hua et al 2017 reported that aromatic proteins e g tryptophan and tyrosine and other aliphatic amide compounds e g arginine lysine histidine etc had high reactivity with chlorine to form tcm dcaa and tcaa after 14 days of incubation the tcmfp concentration decreased slowly by 31 0 40 2 under different pressure conditions fig 4 c and fig s4 c as reported in previous studies zhou et al 2015 low molecular weight substances were the important tcm precursors thus the preferential utilization of low molecular weight by natural microbial consortium decreased tcmfp yields which was consistent with the result of uv250 uv365 additionally it was also observed that dcanfp increased up to the maximum concentration at 4th day and then decreased below the detection limit at 6th day fig 4 d this indicated that the iom biodegradation reduced the production of dcan which was consistent with a prior study zhang et al 2019b in terms of hkfps it increased slowly with the incubation time and finally reached 2 2 2 8 times of the initial concentration fig 4 f and fig s4 f which may be related to the increase of c2 overall the dbpfps showed the similar change trend under different pressure conditions indicating that the impact of mom with different water depths on water quality cannot be ignored compared with anoxic condition the concentration of total dbpfps and haafps continued to decrease by 64 5 and 70 2 during the 14 days incubation under aerobic condition fig 4 a and b this was also related to the rapid reduction of c1 and c2 components under aerobic condition notably tcmfp was decreased by 59 3 under aerobic condition which was higher than the 39 8 drop under anoxic condition fig 4 c the higher decrease of low molecular weight substances resulted in a significant decrease in tcmfp under aerobic condition in general the lower decrease of total dbpfps haafps and tcmfp under anoxic condition implied that the impact of lower do on water quality would seriously influence the formation of dbps in the subsequent water treatment process therefore stratified water intake of the reservoir should be taken to avoid the anoxic water in the mom layer 3 3 the change of potential integrated toxic risks to further investigate the potential toxic effects of dbpfps produced by iom under different mom conditions the potential toxicity of the detected tcmfp haafps tcnmfp and dcanfp were calculated toxicity indexes such as the cytotoxicity index and genotoxicity index have been proposed to quantify the toxicity of dbps the integrated toxicity analysis method as stated in the study of zhang et al 2019a was used in this study to calculate the toxicity of each dbp hks were not included because no cytotoxicity and genotoxicity data were available for them the calculation formula is shown as the below equation 2 i t r v x c t v x c x cx concentration of x m ctvx combined toxicity value of x m 1 itrvx integrated toxic risk value of x x tcmfp haafps tcnmfp and dcanfp the combined toxicity values of each dbp are presented in tab s3 in detail and fig 5 shows the integrated toxicity of dbps formed from iom under different mom conditions as presented in fig 5 the change trend of integrated toxicity risk values and concentration of dbpfps produced by iom were consistent although dcan and tcnm had high genotoxicity and cytotoxicity li et al 2020 plewa et al 2008 the final integrated toxicity was mainly contributed by tcm and haas this was attributable to the lower yields of dcan and tcnm after 14 days of incubation the decrease of integrated toxicity risk values was 23 4 26 6 28 7 and 29 3 under 0 1 0 3 0 5 and 0 8 mpa respectively however the integrated toxicity risk values decreased by 56 9 under aerobic condition which was significantly lower than that under anoxic condition therefore the lower do in water body was not conducive to the transformation of dbps precursors under mom conditions 3 4 association between characteristics of iom and the dbpfps under mom conditions in this study rda was conducted to evaluate the relationships between the dbpfps and iom parameters under different mom conditions so as to better predict dbps precursors the results showed that the first two axes of the rda explained 72 4 of the total variance as shown in fig 6 variables including c1 c3 c4 total fmax uv250 uv365 dcanfp haafps tcmfp and total dbpfps were positively correlated and distributed on the negative axis of rda1 protein c1 and c4 and humic like fluorescence c3 had a high correlation with dbpfps dcanfp haafps total dbpfps and tcmfp which was consistent with the previous study liao et al 2015 suva and uv254 were negatively correlated with dbpfps dcanfp haafps tcmfp and total dbpfps which were not suitable to predict the formation of dbps under mom conditions ates et al 2007 also found that dbps did not correlate with suva in the low suva water as mentioned in the articles hua et al 2017 weishaar et al 2003 the dbps were not only related to the content of aromatic organics in organic components but also affected by the properties of aromatic organics plenty of studies showed that there was a close relationship between the fluorescent and mw characteristics of organic matter and the dbpfps ly et al 2019 hua et al 2019 however the continuous change of the structure and concentration of iom led to the change of dbpfps under different mom conditions but its fluorescence parameter was still expected to be an alternative index to predict the formation of most dbpfps 3 5 mechanisms for the change of iom and corresponding dbpfps 3 5 1 changes in microorganism cell counts and membrane integrity the cell counts and the cell integrity of natural microbial consortium were investigated under different mom conditions and the results are shown in fig 7 and fig s5 the natural microbial consortium concentration increased up to a maximum concentration of 8 6 107 cells ml at 2th day which indicated that higher do was conducive to microbial growth and rapid utilization of organic matter thus reducing doc total fmax and dbpfps at this time the rapid consumption of do and organic matter made it a limiting factor for microbial reproduction so the natural microbial consortium concentration dropped by approximately 92 1 to remain relatively invariant after 6 days fig 7 a gao et al 2015b reported the degradation efficiency of doc was not only limited by doc and natural microbial consortium concentration but also affected by the inhibition of do level under different pressure conditions do became a limiting factor resulting in slow degradation efficiency of organic matter so that the concentration of natural microbial consortium remained at a relatively stable level fig 7 a and fig s5 a it was worth noting that the integrity of the microbial cell membrane did not change significantly under different mom conditions fig 7 b and fig s5 b which indicated that the pressure and do concentration would not damage the membrane integrity of natural microbial consortium at the same time this result also explained that the increase of organic matter concentration and fluorescence intensity was not due to the leakage of organic matter which was caused by the damage of microbial membrane at the beginning of incubation period under anoxic condition 3 5 2 diversity of bacterial metabolic characteristics as shown in fig 8 a the awcd 590nm of samples was significantly higher approximately 48 3 66 2 than that without the incubation after 14 days of incubation p 0 05 t test the utilization efficiency of esters amines amino acids and carboxylic acids were significantly improved the phenomenon showed that natural microbial consortium maintained metabolic activity even under mom conditions therefore after 14 days of incubation the concentration of iom as doc fmax and dbpfps decreased to a certain extent which may be due to the microbial degradation even if do was consumed rapidly under the early stage of aerobic condition the awcd 590nm was still 12 1 higher than that under anoxic condition after 14 days of incubation schram and marzolf 1994 also indicated that do had a certain effect on the natural microbial consortium metabolism of metalimnion therefore the microbial activity was much greater than that under anoxic condition when the water body was always maintained to an aerobic state it was worth noting that the awcd 590nm of sample and the utilization efficiency of amino acids and carbohydrates of the natural microbial consortium were slightly higher under aerobic condition than that under anoxic condition fig 8 b in short the higher metabolic activity of natural microbial consortium could quickly degrade organic matter under aerobic condition which was conducive to the self purification of water quality 3 5 3 microbial community analysis by dna sequencing to clearly describe the differences among the community compositions under different mom conditions alpha diversity parameters ace index chao index shannon index simpson index and coverage index table 2 and the natural microbial consortium at phylum level in fig 9 a and at the genus level in fig 9 b were analyzed for all the 4 samples the coverage index values were over 0 999 in table 2 the ace and shannon and chao index increased after 14 days of incubation indicating that the microbial community diversity increased under different mom conditions follonier et al 2012 concluded that the effects of pressure on molecular systems and microbial metabolism related to the increase of gas solubility generally occurred at elevated pressures up to 10 bar moreover there was no noticeable difference in microbial diversity under different pressure conditions which explained that the characteristic changes of iom were consistent under different pressure conditions notably the diversity of natural microbial consortium was always lower under anoxic condition than that under aerobic condition p 0 05 t test due to the higher microbial activity and diversity the concentration of iom decreased rapidly under aerobic condition thus reducing the precursors of dbps the relative abundance of microbial communities are presented in fig 9 a at phylum level and in fig 9 b at the genus level after 14 days of incubation the microbial community in the samples was still dominated by the sequences of proteobacteria under different mom conditions the relative abundance of proteobacteria was 98 8 in the initial sample 81 4 91 6 and 58 3 in the anoxic and aerobic samples respectively with the increase of do concentration the microbial community became more diverse specifically actinobacteriota and bacteroidota were quickly increased at phylum level which accounted for 2 2 32 0 and 4 7 10 6 respectively it was reported that proteobacteria and bacteroidota played a vital role in the metabolism of organic matter such as carbohydrates proteins amino acids fatty acids and esters indicating that proteobacteria and bacteroidota were potential contributors for the degradation of iom hu et al 2012 ma et al 2013 guo et al 2021 had shown that actinobacteriota played a major role in the metabolism of carbohydrates and amino acids which may be the reason for the rapid degradation of organic matter under aerobic condition natural microbial consortium at the genus level were various under different do conditions pseudomonas spp and comamonas spp and burkholderia caballeronia paraburkholderia spp were the predominant genus under anoxic condition but acinetobacter spp novosphingobium spp and rhodococcus spp were the predominant genus under aerobic condition it was reported that the acinetobacter spp and rhodococcus spp species were the dominant species in the degradation of aromatic and complex organic macromolecules substances which also explained the decrease in average molecular weight and aromaticity of iom in the later stages of incubation under aerobic condition liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019b novosphingobium spp has been reported that could use aliphatic compounds with high h c ratios which had high reactivity with chlorine to form tcm dcaa and tcaa hua et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 therefore the sharp decrease of iom and dbpfps under aerobic condition may be attributed to the degradation roles of acinetobacter spp rhodococcus spp and novosphingobium spp based on the discussion above the water quality of mom layer was comprehensively regulated by environmental factors in which do was the main influencing factor do would affect microbial activity and community diversity thus affecting the transformation of iom and leading to the change of dbpfps although pressure would increase the permeability of microbial membrane and release a small amount of organic matter the high activity and diversity of microorganisms led to the degradation efficiency of organic matter being much higher than its release rate under aerobic condition thus reducing the concentration of iom 4 conclusions the results of the present work showed that mom occurring at different water depths would have similar effects on iom however the effects of different do conditions on iom were obviously different the reduction of do was not conducive to the degradation and utilization of organic matter by natural microbial consortium thus affecting the generation of dbps in the subsequent disinfection process the specific conclusions were as follows 1 the change of iom showed a similar trend under different pressure conditions and its total fmax increased to varying degrees within the first 4 days of incubation and then decreased gradually however doc and total fmax decreased significantly within the first 2 days of incubation under aerobic condition 2 dbpfps study showed the haafps were the main dbpfps species after 14 days of incubation the total dbpfps decreased by 26 2 33 1 under different pressure conditions under aerobic condition tcmfp haafps and total dbpfps decreased gradually and the total dbpfps decreased by 64 5 3 the relationship between total fmax and dbpfps showed a higher correlation than that between suva and dbpfps under different mom conditions indicating fluorescence parameters would be more proper dbps precursor surrogate than that of suva 4 the activity and diversity of natural microbial consortium was always lower under anoxic condition than that under aerobic condition proteobacteria and actinobacteriota may play a critical role in degrading iom and reducing dbpfps under aerobic condition therefore the formation of mom in the reservoir particularly the reduction of do will lead to a decrease in microbial activity and community diversity which is not conducive to the natural decomposition of organic matter and increases the risk of dbps formation thus increasing the risk of water quality declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

15358,most of the reservoirs or lakes will form a metalimnetic oxygen minimum mom with the characterization of a substantial fraction of dissolved oxygen do depleted below the epilimnion the effect of intracellular organic matter iom of algal cells transformed under mom conditions is completely different from that of the original iom on water quality in this study the iom changes of microcystic aeruginosa under different mom conditions and its related disinfection by products formation potentials dbpfps were investigated by changing the pressure and do concentration of mom total fmax increased slightly and then decreased under different pressure conditions finally decreasing by no more than 22 0 under aerobic condition dissolved organic carbon doc and total fmax decreased significantly and decreased by 60 4 and 38 8 within the first 2 days the results of specific uv absorbance suva and uv250 uv365 indicated that aromatic compounds and average molecular weight of iom were gradually increased under different mom conditions the total dbpfps increased firstly and then decreased under different pressure conditions and finally decreased by 26 2 33 1 the decrease of total dbpfps was significantly higher under aerobic condition than that under anoxic condition which finally decreased by 64 5 redundancy analysis showed that the fluorescence parameter protein like and humic like fluorescence could be expected as an index to predict the dbpfps moreover the results revealed that with the decrease of do the activity and diversity of natural microbial consortium decreased which prevented the further degradation and utilization of organic matter by natural microbial consortium therefore lower do was a key player for the deterioration of water quality under mom conditions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords metalimnetic oxygen minimum dissolved oxygen intracellular organic matter disinfection by products formation potentials transformation

phosphorus and other pollutants from the sediment into the water which will adversely deteriorate the water quality beutel et al 2008 wang et al 2012 up to now the phenomenon of mom has been reported in 51 lakes or reservoirs in 10 countries in 1957 shapiro 1960 reported the phenomenon of lower do in the metalimnion in lake washington usa which lasted for six months the existence of mom was also confirmed by cerco et al 2006 many studies have reported that mom mainly occurred at 5 to 40 m below the water surface and do concentration was mostly lower than 4 mg l which reached the lowest level or even anaerobic state from august to september effler et al 1998 kim and cho 1989 the depth of mom and the minimum do concentration varied greatly in different regions due to the water depth reservoir capacity terrain and climate conditions boyd 1980 in a word the metalimnion layer is characterized by hydrostatic pressure natural microbial consortium activity and lower do concentration which is extremely different from the condition of simulating surface water in the laboratory the formation of mom in reservoirs was due to both thermal stratification and cyanobacterial blooms merino ibarra et al 2008 thermal stratification was caused by the difference in water density with temperature at different water depths lee et al 2010 zhang et al 2014c the metalimnion was the layer between the upper continuously mixing epilimnion and the bottom hypolimnion wang et al 2017 yu et al 2010 the metalimnion with high density gradient would lead to the accumulation of declining algae in this area the respiration of algae cells in the metalimnion with low light intensity outcompeted their photosynthetic activity which resulted in the decay of algal cells and further led to the release of intracellular organic matter iom huang et al 2019b wentzky et al 2019 because of the oxygen consumption of metalimnion do was in a minimum state in some areas and even reached the anoxic and anaerobic level moreover the existence of high density gradient in the metalimnion prevented the transportation of do from the surface to the deep water region resulting in an anaerobic condition in the metalimnion zhang et al 2015 many water intake positions were usually located in the middle level namely near the metalimnion to avoid the plenty of algae in the surface water layer and anaerobic environment of the bottom therefore the influence of mom on the water quality of this layer is extremely important at present most studies focused on the effects of iom released by algae cells cultured in the laboratory and its derived disinfection by products dbps on water quality the undesirable iom was composed of numerous carbohydrates amino acids and proteinaceous compounds all of which were potential dbps precursors kralles et al 2020 li et al 2012 the transformation of iom and their derived dbps formation potential dbpfps in the mom zones lower do concentration dark pressure natural microbial consortium action activity is still unknown the transformed products may seriously deteriorate the raw water quality increasing the difficulty of subsequent water treatment processes and water supply risk noori et al 2021 however little attention has been paid to the change of iom under mom conditions the objectives of the study are 1 to investigate the change of iom by simulating mom conditions and its related dbpfps 2 to examine the relationship between iom and its related dbpfps under mom conditions 3 to explore the mechanisms of iom change and its related dbpfps by investigating the variation of microbial metabolic activity and community during the incubation 2 materials and methods 2 1 algal cultivation and iom isolation microcystic m aeruginosa was selected for this study because it was commonly found as a dominant blooming species in most lakes and reservoirs in china m aeruginosa was incubated in the modified bg 11 media in an incubator at 25 2 12 h light 12 h dark cycles li et al 2012 algal suspensions of the late stationary phase were centrifuged at 9600 rpm for 15 min followed by supernatant removal the centrifuged cells were firstly washed three times with 0 8 nacl and subsequently re suspended in milli q water for three freeze thawing cycles the supernatant was then centrifuged for 15 min at 9600 r min iom was obtained by passing the filtrate through 0 22 μm pre sterilized filter membranes daly et al 2007 gao et al 2015a 2 2 experimental procedures the experiments were carried out in a customized hermetic stainless steel container with a volume of 5 l fig 1 which consisted of a sampling port discharge valve pressure gage and nitrogen injection port inoculum water was collected in a sterile glass flask from a reservoir in xi an china returned to the laboratory and filtered through 5 μm pre sterilized filter membranes to remove grazers phytoplankton zooplankton and detritus the filtrate was then centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 min pelletized natural microbial consortium was resuspended in the sterile medium to improve its yield for subsequent experiments phosphate buffer at a concentration of 1 mmol l as p was added to keep each solution at ph 7 0 0 2 during the incubation calcium chloride and magnesium chloride were added to achieve each initial concentration of 50 mg l as ca2 and mg2 the iom was the only source of nitrogen and carbon in each test with an initial doc concentration of 4 80 mg l the natural microbial consortium was put into the reaction system together with iom with an initial concentration of 3 0 107 cells ml the depths of metalimnetic were simulated by injecting nitrogen into the hermetic container to achieve different pressures the pressure setups were 0 1 0 3 0 5 and 0 8 mpa respectively to simulate water depths of 10 30 50 and 80 m 80 m depth referred to as the bottom hypolimnion since anoxic condition also appeared at the bottom of the reservoir 80 m was set only to study the effect of pressure on iom transformation under anoxic condition and all of the do concentration was approximately 0 5 mg l different do concentration were also set to simulate different mom conditions for test under anoxic condition high purity nitrogen 99 99 was continuously injected into certain container to maintain the initial do level about 0 5 mg l for test under aerobic condition air was continuously injected into container to maintain the initial do concentration about 3 0 mg l the pressure of aerobic and anoxic experimental setting was 0 3 mpa the experiment was lasted 14 days at room temperature 25 2 samples were collected every two days for analysis and the natural microbial consortium analyses were examined on 0 without inoculation and 14 days after different incubation time the 120 ml samples were taken to test the dbpfps water quality analysis and the cell counts and integrity of natural microbial consortium the 500 ml samples were collected before and after the experiment for microbial diversity tests each experimental condition performed three times independently and each sample was measured in three replicates 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 water quality analyses the doc was quantified using a toc analyzer toc l shimadzu japan the uv254 was determined by uv spectrophotometer uv2600a unico usa and the specific uv absorbance suva was calculated by the ratio of uv254

between 250 and 365 nm i e uv250 uv365 helms et al 2008 molecular weight decreased as the ratio increases all samples were filtered through 0 22 μm pre sterilized filter membranes prior to measurement 2 3 2 eem parafac analysis the excitation emission matrix fluorescence and parallel factor eem parafac analysis were useful in distinguishing organic matter structural characteristics and sources as

spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi japan eems were acquired by scanning at 1 2000 nm min over emission em wavelengths ranging from 250 to 550 nm at 2 nm intervals and excitation ex wavelengths ranging from 220 to 420 nm at 5 nm intervals both em and ex slits were set as 5 nm in each sample an eem of a control milli q water was subtracted from eem to remove most of raman scatter peaks fluorescence data was modeled in matlab 7 0 software using the domfluor toolbox stedmon and bro 2008 split half analysis was used to determine numbers of components the sample specific maximum fluorescence fmax referred to the fluorescence intensity of the component output by the model reflecting the parafac component concentration in raman units ru component concentration increased as the fmax increased the bioavailability of organic matter depended not only on its size but also on its structural characteristics bittar et al 2015 the transformation of organic matter by natural microbial consortium could also be further explained by analyzing the changes of fmax of each component 2 3 3 flow cytometric measurements the membrane integrity and concentration of natural microbial consortium during incubation were measured with a flow cytometer accuri c6 bd usa the dye was sybr green і propidium iodide sg pi cao et al 2021 staining procedures were performed as follows 10 μl of sg pi were added to a 500 μl water sample which incubated at 35 for 20 min in dark wen et al 2020 more details on testing procedures could be obtained in our prior studies cao et al 2022 2 3 4 microbial metabolic

aerobic do 3 0 mg l conditions in 0 3 mpa biolog eco microplate eco microplate matrix technologies usa contained thirty one sole carbon sources including six types carbohydrates amino acids esters alcohols amines and carboxylic acids tab s1 the eco plates were cultured in darkness at 28 2 for 240 h and tested every 24 h with an elisa reader biolog ca usa the average well color development at 590 nm awcd 590nm was calculated using the data acquired at each time point as a measure of the metabolic activity of the natural microbial consortium zhang et al 2014b the awcd 590nm of each sample under 120 h of incubation time was selected to calculate the utilization efficiency of carbon sources stefanowicz 2006 2 3 5 microbial diversity analysis to analyze the natural microbial consortium structure samples were collected for the sequencing measurements after inoculation under different mom conditions each sample was filtered through 0 22 μm pre sterilized filter membranes samples filtered on the membranes were stored at 20 until test microbial dna was extracted and purified using the e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga u s the nanodrop 2000 uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific wilmington usa was used to determine the final dna concentration and purification the v3 v4 hypervariable regions of the bacteria 16s rrna gene were amplified with primers 338f actcctacgggaggcagcag and 806r ggactachvgggtwtctaat by thermocycler pcr system geneamp 9700 abi usa sequencing was on an illumina miseq platform illumina usa at major bio shanghai china 2 3 6 dbpfps analysis chlorination experiments were kept at 25 0 5 in the dark for 3 days using sealed 40 ml amber glass bottles under headspace free conditions the ph of solution was buffered at 7 0 0 2 with phosphate buffer prior to dbpfps tests the free chlorine dosages for dbpfps tests were determined by eq 1 krasner et al 2007 after 3 days reaction time the residual chlorine was quenched by na2s2o3 0 1 m and then extracted for dbpfps analysis the initial and residual chlorine concentration were measured using dpd spectrophotometry wan et al 2022 1 cl2 dosage mg l 3 doc mg c l 7 6 nh3 n mg n l 10 mg l analyses of dbpfps were completed by gas chromatography sp 3510 beifen ruili china with an electron capture detector gc ecd according to the usepa method 551 1 and usepa method 552 3 the used column was a kb 5 fused silica capillary column 30 m 0 32 mm i d with 0 50 μm film thickness the detailed information about the dbpfps analytical method was provided in tab s2 2 4 statistical analysis ibm spss statistics version 22 software was performed to evaluate if there was significant difference in the results suva uv250 uv365 fmax dbpfps concentration of samples under different mom conditions the t test was used to test the data redundancy analysis rda was used for assessing the correlation between the iom parameters and dbpfps canoco version 4 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 change of iom characteristics under different mom conditions 3 1 1 effect of pressure the characteristics of iom during the incubation under different pressure conditions are shown in fig 2 the doc fluctuated at the beginning of incubation period and then decreased by 35 5 under 0 3 mpa after 14 days of incubation the suva finally increased by 239 0 and the uv250 uv365 decreased by 35 5 the results implied that the proportion of aromatic compounds and the molecular size of organic matter gradually increased which was due to the preferential utilization of low molecular weight and non aromatic fractions of iom by natural microbial consortium liu et al 2021 wen et al 2019 the same change trends of the doc suva and uv250 uv365 were also observed under 0 1 mpa 0 5 mpa and 0 8 mpa fig 2 and fig s1 and there was no significant difference in the characteristics of iom under different pressure conditions fig s2 the change of fluorescent components of organic matter was analyzed by the eem parafac analysis fig 3 four different fluorescent components c1 c2 c3 c4 were identified and their eem contours ex em loadings and fluorescence peak positions are given in table 1 as shown in fig 3 under different pressure conditions total fmax increased by 53 3 80 2 within the first 4 days of incubation but then decreased slowly over the next 10 days fig 3 and fig s3 ultimately the total fmax decreased by 4 8 22 0 the increase of total fmax with the first 4 days was mainly attributed to the appearance of c1 and c2 substances which may be derived from the leakage of microbial intracellular substances such as tryptophan like substances or the products of microbial degradation of c3 substances jia and cui 2009 romera castillo et al 2011 in general the doc and total fmax of iom decreased to a certain extent under different pressure conditions but its aromaticity and molecular weight showed an increasing trend 3 1 2 effect of do the changes of iom incubation under anoxic or aerobic conditions are shown in fig 2 under aerobic condition the doc was degraded sharply to 1 90 mg l within the first 2 days and the degradation rate reached the maximum value of 60 4 however the doc decreased at 4th day and finally decreased by 35 5 under anoxic condition gao et al 2015b showed that the biodegradation of organic matter was affected by do doc concentration microbial activity cells abundance and so on the suva increased under different do conditions but after 10 days the suva decreased slightly to 0 83 l mg m under aerobic condition which was lower than that under anoxic condition t test p 0 075 additionally it was observed that uv250 uv365 increased slightly after 2 days under aerobic condition fig 2 b which may be due to the phenomenon that complex organic macromolecules and aromatic compounds could be degraded by some specific microbial community chen and hur 2015 as shown in fig 3 the change of total fmax followed a variation profile similar to that of doc under different do conditions under aerobic condition total fmax decreased rapidly from 1 47 to 0 90 ru within the first 2 days and finally stabilized at 0 80 ru among them the degradation efficiency of c1 and c2 was both significantly higher than that of c3 which was because that natural microbial consortium would give priority to tyrosine like proteins or tryptophan like proteins lee et al 2018 under anoxic condition the total fmax increased up to 2 26 ru firstly and then decreased to 1 38 ru which was still significantly higher than that under aerobic condition this phenomenon was due to the higher activity of natural microbial consortium under aerobic condition which could effectively degrade and utilize organic matter schram and marzolf 1994 therefore the water body should be maintained to an aerobic state to reduce the impact of mom on water quality 3 2 change of dbpfps derived from iom under different mom conditions the results of dbpfps derived from iom under different mom conditions are shown in fig 4 and fig s4 the dbpfps species of the water samples were chloroform formation potential tcmfp haloacetic acid formation potential haafps dichloroacetic acid formation potential dcaafp trichloroacetic acid formation potential tcaafp and dibromoacetic acid formation potential dbaafp haloketone formation potential hkfps 1 1 dichloro 2 propanone formation potential 1 1 dcpfp and 1 1 1 trichloro 2 propanone formation potential 1 1 1 tcpfp trichloronitromethane formation potential tcnmfp and dichloroacetonitrile formation potential dcanfp moreover the main two species were tcmfp and haafps which was in agreement with the results of huang et al 2019a as illustrated in fig 4 a the total dbpfps increased within the first 2 days and finally decreased by 26 2 33 1 under different pressure conditions the haafps had a similar pattern under different pressure conditions where the peak concentration of haafps were 42 1 125 6 higher than the initial concentration fig 4 b finally the haafps decreased by 26 5 30 5 the result of haafps was in consistent with the changes of c1 and c2 components hua et al 2017 reported that aromatic proteins e g tryptophan and tyrosine and other aliphatic amide compounds e g arginine lysine histidine etc had high reactivity with chlorine to form tcm dcaa and tcaa after 14 days of incubation the tcmfp concentration decreased slowly by 31 0 40 2 under different pressure conditions fig 4 c and fig s4 c as reported in previous studies zhou et al 2015 low molecular weight substances were the important tcm precursors thus the preferential utilization of low molecular weight by natural microbial consortium decreased tcmfp yields which was consistent with the result of uv250 uv365 additionally it was also observed that dcanfp increased up to the maximum concentration at 4th day and then decreased below the detection limit at 6th day fig 4 d this indicated that the iom biodegradation reduced the production of dcan which was consistent with a prior study zhang et al 2019b in terms of hkfps it increased slowly with the incubation time and finally reached 2 2 2 8 times of the initial concentration fig 4 f and fig s4 f which may be related to the increase of c2 overall the dbpfps showed the similar change trend under different pressure conditions indicating that the impact of mom with different water depths on water quality cannot be ignored compared with anoxic condition the concentration of total dbpfps and haafps continued to decrease by 64 5 and 70 2 during the 14 days incubation under aerobic condition fig 4 a and b this was also related to the rapid reduction of c1 and c2 components under aerobic condition notably tcmfp was decreased by 59 3 under aerobic condition which was higher than the 39 8 drop under anoxic condition fig 4 c the higher decrease of low molecular weight substances resulted in a significant decrease in tcmfp under aerobic condition in general the lower decrease of total dbpfps haafps and tcmfp under anoxic condition implied that the impact of lower do on water quality would seriously influence the formation of dbps in the subsequent water treatment process therefore stratified water intake of the reservoir should be taken to avoid the anoxic water in the mom layer 3 3 the change of potential integrated toxic risks to further investigate the potential toxic effects of dbpfps produced by iom under different mom conditions the potential toxicity of the detected tcmfp haafps tcnmfp and dcanfp were calculated toxicity indexes such as the cytotoxicity index and genotoxicity index have been proposed to quantify the toxicity of dbps the integrated toxicity analysis method as stated in the study of zhang et al 2019a was used in this study to calculate the toxicity of each dbp hks were not included because no cytotoxicity and genotoxicity data were available for them the calculation formula is shown as the below equation 2 i t r v x c t v x c x cx concentration of x m ctvx combined toxicity value of x m 1 itrvx integrated toxic risk value of x x tcmfp haafps tcnmfp and dcanfp the combined toxicity values of each dbp are presented in tab s3 in detail and fig 5 shows the integrated toxicity of dbps formed from iom under different mom conditions as presented in fig 5 the change trend of integrated toxicity risk values and concentration of dbpfps produced by iom were consistent although dcan and tcnm had high genotoxicity and cytotoxicity li et al 2020 plewa et al 2008 the final integrated toxicity was mainly contributed by tcm and haas this was attributable to the lower yields of dcan and tcnm after 14 days of incubation the decrease of integrated toxicity risk values was 23 4 26 6 28 7 and 29 3 under 0 1 0 3 0 5 and 0 8 mpa respectively however the integrated toxicity risk values decreased by 56 9 under aerobic condition which was significantly lower than that under anoxic condition therefore the lower do in water body was not conducive to the transformation of dbps precursors under mom conditions 3 4 association between characteristics of iom and the dbpfps under mom conditions in this study rda was conducted to evaluate the relationships between the dbpfps and iom parameters under different mom conditions so as to better predict dbps precursors the results showed that the first two axes of the rda explained 72 4 of the total variance as shown in fig 6 variables including c1 c3 c4 total fmax uv250 uv365 dcanfp haafps tcmfp and total dbpfps were positively correlated and distributed on the negative axis of rda1 protein c1 and c4 and humic like fluorescence c3 had a high correlation with dbpfps dcanfp haafps total dbpfps and tcmfp which was consistent with the previous study liao et al 2015 suva and uv254 were negatively correlated with dbpfps dcanfp haafps tcmfp and total dbpfps which were not suitable to predict the formation of dbps under mom conditions ates et al 2007 also found that dbps did not correlate with suva in the low suva water as mentioned in the articles hua et al 2017 weishaar et al 2003 the dbps were not only related to the content of aromatic organics in organic components but also affected by the properties of aromatic organics plenty of studies showed that there was a close relationship between the fluorescent and mw characteristics of organic matter and the dbpfps ly et al 2019 hua et al 2019 however the continuous change of the structure and concentration of iom led to the change of dbpfps under different mom conditions but its fluorescence parameter was still expected to be an alternative index to predict the formation of most dbpfps 3 5 mechanisms for the change of iom and corresponding dbpfps 3 5 1 changes in microorganism cell counts and membrane integrity the cell counts and the cell integrity of natural microbial consortium were investigated under different mom conditions and the results are shown in fig 7 and fig s5 the natural microbial consortium concentration increased up to a maximum concentration of 8 6 107 cells ml at 2th day which indicated that higher do was conducive to microbial growth and rapid utilization of organic matter thus reducing doc total fmax and dbpfps at this time the rapid consumption of do and organic matter made it a limiting factor for microbial reproduction so the natural microbial consortium concentration dropped by approximately 92 1 to remain relatively invariant after 6 days fig 7 a gao et al 2015b reported the degradation efficiency of doc was not only limited by doc and natural microbial consortium concentration but also affected by the inhibition of do level under different pressure conditions do became a limiting factor resulting in slow degradation efficiency of organic matter so that the concentration of natural microbial consortium remained at a relatively stable level fig 7 a and fig s5 a it was worth noting that the integrity of the microbial cell membrane did not change significantly under different mom conditions fig 7 b and fig s5 b which indicated that the pressure and do concentration would not damage the membrane integrity of natural microbial consortium at the same time this result also explained that the increase of organic matter concentration and fluorescence intensity was not due to the leakage of organic matter which was caused by the damage of microbial membrane at the beginning of incubation period under anoxic condition 3 5 2 diversity of bacterial metabolic characteristics as shown in fig 8 a the awcd 590nm of samples was significantly higher approximately 48 3 66 2 than that without the incubation after 14 days of incubation p 0 05 t test the utilization efficiency of esters amines amino acids and carboxylic acids were significantly improved the phenomenon showed that natural microbial consortium maintained metabolic activity even under mom conditions therefore after 14 days of incubation the concentration of iom as doc fmax and dbpfps decreased to a certain extent which may be due to the microbial degradation even if do was consumed rapidly under the early stage of aerobic condition the awcd 590nm was still 12 1 higher than that under anoxic condition after 14 days of incubation schram and marzolf 1994 also indicated that do had a certain effect on the natural microbial consortium metabolism of metalimnion therefore the microbial activity was much greater than that under anoxic condition when the water body was always maintained to an aerobic state it was worth noting that the awcd 590nm of sample and the utilization efficiency of amino acids and carbohydrates of the natural microbial consortium were slightly higher under aerobic condition than that under anoxic condition fig 8 b in short the higher metabolic activity of natural microbial consortium could quickly degrade organic matter under aerobic condition which was conducive to the self purification of water quality 3 5 3 microbial community analysis by dna sequencing to clearly describe the differences among the community compositions under different mom conditions alpha diversity parameters ace index chao index shannon index simpson index and coverage index table 2 and the natural microbial consortium at phylum level in fig 9 a and at the genus level in fig 9 b were analyzed for all the 4 samples the coverage index values were over 0 999 in table 2 the ace and shannon and chao index increased after 14 days of incubation indicating that the microbial community diversity increased under different mom conditions follonier et al 2012 concluded that the effects of pressure on molecular systems and microbial metabolism related to the increase of gas solubility generally occurred at elevated pressures up to 10 bar moreover there was no noticeable difference in microbial diversity under different pressure conditions which explained that the characteristic changes of iom were consistent under different pressure conditions notably the diversity of natural microbial consortium was always lower under anoxic condition than that under aerobic condition p 0 05 t test due to the higher microbial activity and diversity the concentration of iom decreased rapidly under aerobic condition thus reducing the precursors of dbps the relative abundance of microbial communities are presented in fig 9 a at phylum level and in fig 9 b at the genus level after 14 days of incubation the microbial community in the samples was still dominated by the sequences of proteobacteria under different mom conditions the relative abundance of proteobacteria was 98 8 in the initial sample 81 4 91 6 and 58 3 in the anoxic and aerobic samples respectively with the increase of do concentration the microbial community became more diverse specifically actinobacteriota and bacteroidota were quickly increased at phylum level which accounted for 2 2 32 0 and 4 7 10 6 respectively it was reported that proteobacteria and bacteroidota played a vital role in the metabolism of organic matter such as carbohydrates proteins amino acids fatty acids and esters indicating that proteobacteria and bacteroidota were potential contributors for the degradation of iom hu et al 2012 ma et al 2013 guo et al 2021 had shown that actinobacteriota played a major role in the metabolism of carbohydrates and amino acids which may be the reason for the rapid degradation of organic matter under aerobic condition natural microbial consortium at the genus level were various under different do conditions pseudomonas spp and comamonas spp and burkholderia caballeronia paraburkholderia spp were the predominant genus under anoxic condition but acinetobacter spp novosphingobium spp and rhodococcus spp were the predominant genus under aerobic condition it was reported that the acinetobacter spp and rhodococcus spp species were the dominant species in the degradation of aromatic and complex organic macromolecules substances which also explained the decrease in average molecular weight and aromaticity of iom in the later stages of incubation under aerobic condition liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019b novosphingobium spp has been reported that could use aliphatic compounds with high h c ratios which had high reactivity with chlorine to form tcm dcaa and tcaa hua et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 therefore the sharp decrease of iom and dbpfps under aerobic condition may be attributed to the degradation roles of acinetobacter spp rhodococcus spp and novosphingobium spp based on the discussion above the water quality of mom layer was comprehensively regulated by environmental factors in which do was the main influencing factor do would affect microbial activity and community diversity thus affecting the transformation of iom and leading to the change of dbpfps although pressure would increase the permeability of microbial membrane and release a small amount of organic matter the high activity and diversity of microorganisms led to the degradation efficiency of organic matter being much higher than its release rate under aerobic condition thus reducing the concentration of iom 4 conclusions the results of the present work showed that mom occurring at different water depths would have similar effects on iom however the effects of different do conditions on iom were obviously different the reduction of do was not conducive to the degradation and utilization of organic matter by natural microbial consortium thus affecting the generation of dbps in the subsequent disinfection process the specific conclusions were as follows 1 the change of iom showed a similar trend under different pressure conditions and its total fmax increased to varying degrees within the first 4 days of incubation and then decreased gradually however doc and total fmax decreased significantly within the first 2 days of incubation under aerobic condition 2 dbpfps study showed the haafps were the main dbpfps species after 14 days of incubation the total dbpfps decreased by 26 2 33 1 under different pressure conditions under aerobic condition tcmfp haafps and total dbpfps decreased gradually and the total dbpfps decreased by 64 5 3 the relationship between total fmax and dbpfps showed a higher correlation than that between suva and dbpfps under different mom conditions indicating fluorescence parameters would be more proper dbps precursor surrogate than that of suva 4 the activity and diversity of natural microbial consortium was always lower under anoxic condition than that under aerobic condition proteobacteria and actinobacteriota may play a critical role in degrading iom and reducing dbpfps under aerobic condition therefore the formation of mom in the reservoir particularly the reduction of do will lead to a decrease in microbial activity and community diversity which is not conducive to the natural decomposition of organic matter and increases the risk of dbps formation thus increasing the risk of water quality declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

15359,under the limitation of the carrier yield and mobility of semiconductor photocatalysts and the reaction domain it seems that the photocatalytic efficiency cannot be greatly improved here an efficient contact electro catalysis cec system based on droplet triboelectric nanogenerator teng is developed instead of using traditional semiconductor catalysts the electric charge transferred

catalysis self powered degradation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the issue of how to efficiently treat organic pollutants in industrial and domestic wastewater has received widespread attention anjum et al 2019 chen et al 2016 du et al 2016 among the common wastewater treatment methods the physical method mainly transfers pollutants from the water to another phase through physical adsorption li et al 2019 tang et al 2018 ultrafiltration shen et al 2011 reverse osmosis kim et al 2018 etc without destroying the structure of the pollutants and easily causing secondary pollution biological method is to decompose organic matter through microbial metabolism and the efficiency of decolorization and degradation is not high ma et al 2016 the

photocatalysis koe et al 2020 wen et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 and piezoelectric catalysis feng et al 2017 wu et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 have become research hotspots in recent years however the photocatalytic efficiency using semiconductors as catalysts has been limited by the carrier yield and mobility the powdered catalyst is difficult to separate and recover piezoelectric catalysis using piezoelectric materials as catalysts also requires external energy ultrasonic vibration in addition in the existing oxidation methods the catalyst is put into the wastewater and the strong oxidizing group generated by the catalyst first appears on the surface of the catalyst and can only be distributed in the entire solution by free diffusion these will limit the degradation efficiency of the dye the triboelectric nanogenerator teng based on contact electrification and electrostatic induction coupling can collect low frequency mechanical energy from the environment and convert it into electrical energy yang et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 since it was invented by professor wang and his research team in 2012 it has received widespread attention fan et al 2012 wang 2018 teng can collect all kinds of mechanical energy in the environment including wind chen et al 2021 wang et al 2020 waves chen et al 2020 liang et al 2020 human movement huang et al 2020 lai et al 2019 mechanical

al 2020 the charge transfer mechanism of the liquid solid interface has also become a research hotspot electron transfer is the main factor in generating electricity lin et al 2022 the droplets slide freely from the surface of the polymer film and generate electricity through contact electrification and electrostatic induction at the same time strong oxidizing group hydroxyl radicals o h are generated in the droplets that have lost electrons zhan et al 2020 the uniform distribution of o h in the droplets is a favorable condition for high efficiency catalysis after reasonable design droplet teng is expected to become an effective means of catalytic degradation furthermore a catalysis process designed based on contact electrification between liquid and solid interface is called contact electro catalysis cec as demonstrated most recently as a new approach for catalysis using conventional materials at large wang et al 2022 in this work the cec is combined with droplet teng to

catalysis has greatly contributed to the development of the field of catalysis using the vast array of available materials 2 results and discussion 2 1 structure and principle of contact electro catalysis a large number of strong oxidizing free radicals can be generated in the process of mechanically induced contact electrification at the liquid solid interface this is of great significance for low cost and rapid degradation of refractory pollutants in wastewater in future industrialization fig 1 a the cec device is designed based on a single electrode droplet teng as shown in fig 1b it is composed of three parts the top layer is a polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membrane for contact electrification the middle layer is an aluminum electrode for electrostatic induction and the bottom layer is a supporting substrate ptfe is a hydrophobic material with a water contact angle of 117 as shown in fig 1c therefore the droplets can easily slip off the inclined ptfe film due to the contact electrification the droplet will transfer charge during the contact with the ptfe membrane then the charge is exported through electrostatic induction which is the droplet teng fig 1d however the charge transfer between the droplets and the ptfe membranes is also accompanied by subsequent chemical reactions lin et al 2020 loh et al 2020 h 2 o h 2 o o h h 3 o e o 2 o 2 after losing an electron a water molecule quickly becomes a cation hole h 2 o and then quickly combines with adjacent water molecules to produce hydroxyl radicals o h with strong oxidizing properties in addition the electrons on the surface of the membrane by contact electrification are excited by photons and combine with o 2 in the water to form superoxide radicals o 2 which are also highly oxidizing o 2 will generate o h through a chain reaction if there are macromolecular dyes in the droplets the strong oxidizing o h produced can well decolorize and degrade the dyes thereby achieving cec fig 1e the method has simple equipment and no energy consumption and can be an effective method for chromaticity treatment of industrial wastewater fig 1f is the structure diagram of the industrialized wastewater treatment system based on cec it mainly includes a pool for temporary wastewater storage a pipeline for wastewater transportation there are droppers that are densely arranged at equal intervals on the pipeline to make the wastewater drop by drop an inclined dielectric film located below the dropper as catalyst and a bracket used to adjust the tilt angle and height of the dielectric film 2 2 contact electro catalysis degradation of crystal violet in order to explore the mechanism of cec and the influence of various factors on the catalytic effect a simple device as shown in fig 2 a was designed the crystal violet cv solution slides drop by drop from the surface of the ptfe membrane at a speed of 2 drops per second the droplet size is 15 μl and the polymer tilt angle is 45 fig 2b shows the absorbance of 3 ml cv solution 30 mg l 1 at different times during the cec process the complete dripping of the 3 ml solution is regarded as a cycle with a duration of 75 s as the number of cycles increases the absorbance of the cv solution decreases significantly it shows that cv molecules were gradually being catalyzed and decomposed when the number of cycles is 12 the degradation rate of cv reaches 96 fig 2c tert butanol tba potassium iodide ki and benzoquinone pbq can capture o h h and o 2 in the solution respectively with their assistance the mechanism of cec can be better understood as shown in fig 2d e and f the addition of different concentrations of tba ki and pbq all have different degrees of inhibition on the degradation of cv however the inhibitory effect of tba is the most obvious indicating that o h radicals play a major role in the catalytic degradation of cv the inhibitory effect of ki can be explained by the fact that its trapping rate of holes is less than the generation rate of o h resulting in that there are still some o h radicals in the solution that participate in the catalytic degradation of cv so the inhibitory effect of ki is not as significant as that of tba the inhibitory effect of pbq indicates the existence of o 2 and it also shows that o 2 radicals are also involved in the catalytic degradation of cv this is a good proof of the correctness of the principle of cec degradation in fig 1e since ptfe is a good hydrophobic material it has very little adsorption of dyes which can be ignored fig 2g however its inclination angle has a greater impact on the degradation efficiency of the dye as shown in fig 2h too large or too small an angle will reduce the degradation efficiency the most suitable angle is 45 to 50 the detailed analysis process is shown in figures s1 and s2 while height has little effect on the catalytic efficiency figure s3 the amount of degraded dyes per unit time of cv solution with different initial concentrations is also different as shown in fig 2i as the initial concentration of cv increases the degradation quality of the dye first increases and then decreases rather than a monotonous increase the optimal concentration is 30 mg l 1 here degradation quality is used to describe the degradation of crystal violet solutions of different concentrations it represents the quality of crystal violet that is degraded after a certain concentration of crystal violet solution has been catalytically degraded for a period of time and cycles it is worth noting that the catalyst and contaminants in this cec system are relatively independent which undoubtedly reduces the cost of separating the catalyst from the treated water although the degradation efficiency of cv will be reduced after multiple cycles when the membrane is cleaned with alcohol the catalytic efficiency is significantly improved reaching the high catalytic efficiency of the initial state as shown in figure s4 it proves the reusability of the cec film and there is no need to separate the catalyst from wastewater after the catalysis is completed showing the unparalleled advantages of cec in order to further prove the reliability of the cec theory some reliable chemical characterization methods were used the electron spin resonance esr spectroscopy objectively proves the existence of o h and o 2 radicals as shown in fig 3 a and b the test process is shown in figure s6 in the electron spin resonance test it was found that light room light at normal indoor illumination condition is an important factor in the generation of o 2 fig 3c this is also well demonstrated in the catalytic data the electrons on the surface of the ptfe membrane react with o 2 under the excitation of photons to generate o 2 which accelerates the progress of the catalytic reaction in the absence of light only o h radicals participate in the catalytic reaction and the catalytic efficiency will be reduced to a certain extent as shown in fig 3d more importantly without the participation of light the electrons obtained by the contact electrification on the ptfe surface cannot participate in the reaction and will gradually accumulate so that the ptfe gradually reaches saturation the saturated ptfe and water cannot continue the charge transfer and the cec gradually stops however cec under light can always proceed to further explore how light affects cec a series of experiments were designed the effect of illumination on cec was explored by varying the illumination of the catalytic environment in a darkroom fig 3e f and g in the low illumination range 0 4 lx the cec efficiency increases with the increase of illumination when the illuminance is larger than 5 lx there is no obvious change in the catalytic efficiency as the illuminance continues to increase this shows that saturation has been reached and the number of electrons obtained by the ptfe due to contact electrification is similar to the number of photons at 4 lx illumination the wavelength of light has no obvious effect on cec figures s11 and even red light with a longer wavelength and lower energy can achieve a good catalytic effect the infrared spectra of the ptfe membrane before and after the catalysis ruled out the possibility of adsorption fig 3h as no characteristic peaks of cv were observed the liquid chromatographic mass spectrum fig 3i and s7 identified the intermediate products formed during the degradation of cv dyes as c4h10o2 and c8h18o2 which proved that the catalytic reaction had indeed occurred the data of toc also further proves the mineralization ability of cec system on cv degradation table s3 2 3 electrical output during catalysis the output signal of the cec system based on the droplet teng can not only help to better understand the mechanism of cec but also can judge the concentration of the dye in the wastewater by the size of the output signal under certain circumstances so as to monitor the degree of catalytic degradation in real time for the water droplet teng the output signal can be divided into two stages unsaturated and saturated as shown in fig 4 a in the initial stage the ptfe membrane is not saturated and continuously obtains electrons from the water droplets generating a negative current with the continuous accumulation of electrons the ptfe membrane gradually reaches a saturated state and the generation and disappearance of polarized charges in the water droplets lead to positive and then negative alternating currents when the water droplets are replaced with wastewater containing cv the electrical signal changes significantly fig 4b it can be reasonably assumed that there are fewer electrons on the surface of ptfe in the initial stage so the o 2 generated are relatively few and the droplet loses electrons dominated so it appears as a negative current as the electrons on the surface of ptfe gradually increase the amount of o 2 produced gradually increases gradually exceeding the number of charges lost by the droplets so the current gradually changes from negative to positive when the equilibrium state is finally reached the droplet loses electrons and reaches equilibrium with the capture of o 2 so a stable positive and negative current is generated figure s8 there is no significant change in the electrical signal when the falling droplets are collected and then catalyzed for the second time as shown in fig 4c as shown in fig 4d when the ptfe membrane was rinsed with alcohol the electrical signal returned to the initial state fig 4b demonstrating the reproducibility of the cec the concentration of dye in the solution is different the intensity of the oxidation reduction reaction is also different the demand for electric charge is also different and the external appearance is different current magnitude as shown in fig 4e the magnitude of the current signal in the catalytic degradation process of different concentrations of cv is different as the cv concentration decreases the current gradually decreases therefore the current signal can be used as a reliable basis for judging the degree of dye degradation this rule can also be obtained in the graph of charge transfer fig 4f the higher the concentration the more o h and o 2 involved in the reaction so the more charges are transferred 2 4 working mechanism of droplet teng for contact electro catalysis collectively fig 5 proposes a cec principle cec can be performed continuously under light fig 5a without the participation of light the electrons on the ptfe surface will gradually accumulate and eventually reach saturation and cec will also stop fig 5b the electron cloud potential well model of fig 5c and f can explain the reason why electrons transfer between two substances however the process of electron transfer is also accompanied by chemical reactions in the initial stage the dye droplet falls in contact with the uncharged polymer film making the film negatively charged and itself positively charged due to electron transfer from water molecules a water molecule losses an electron and becomes h 2 o which has a rather short life and it quickly combines with water molecules to become radicals according to lin et al 2020 loh et al 2020 h 2 o h 2 o o h h 3 o a large number of o h participate in the catalytic degradation of the dye fig 5d e when the surface of the polymer is negatively charged the surface electrons combine with o 2 in the droplet under the excitation of the photon to produce o 2 o 2 will generate o h through a chain reaction which then participates in the catalytic degradation of cv wang et al 2022 and the uncharged ptfe can continue to contact with water to realize electron transfer so as to achieve a virtuous circle fig 5g i fig 5j is the chemical equation for the formation of o h and o 2 radicals in the cec process these strong oxidizing free radicals will attack the unsaturated groups and conjugated systems in the crystal violet molecules so that the large π conjugated color system in the crystal violet molecules will gradually be degraded and destroyed become colorless and form saturated compounds or even harmless products such as water and carbon dioxide fig 5k 2 5 multiple drop outlets for ultra efficient contact electro catalysis based on a good understanding of the cec system a self powered multi droppers device that can monitor the catalytic progress is designed as shown in fig 6 a the traditional oxidation method to treat wastewater requires the catalyst to be put into the wastewater and the strong oxidizing groups o h and o 2 produced are distributed on the surface of the catalyst and its vicinity al mamun et al 2019 the uneven distribution of strong oxidizing groups in wastewater will greatly reduce the rate of catalytic degradation as for the cec system when the wastewater comes into contact with the polymer membrane drop by drop the strong oxidizing groups will be uniformly distributed in the wastewater which can greatly improve the catalytic efficiency video s1 in addition increasing the drop outlets and accelerating the dripping speed of waste water can further increase the catalytic rate when the number of drip openings increased from one to 16 the catalytic speed was greatly improved and the cv absorbance dropped sharply within 38 s fig 6b and the absorption peak of the benzene ring at 230 nm the absorption peak of the polar and unsaturated functional groups and the conjugated system of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons at 310 nm gradually weakened or even disappeared the transient enhancement in the middle may be caused by the increased absorption of small molecules containing benzene ring structures due to the destruction of the large conjugated system from the optical photo in the inset of fig 6c it can also be seen that the cv solution is almost colorless at 38 s the degradation efficiency of cv reaches 90 the reaction kinetics can be treated as pseudo first order and can be written as follow 1 ln c 0 c k t the rate constant k value can be derived from the plot of ln c0 c versus t fig 6d through linear fitting the rate constant k value is calculated to be 3 7 min 1 which is much larger than reported in previous work tables s1 and s2 such high catalytic efficiency is due to the high amount of charge generated by contact electrification although it is impossible to transfer such a large amount of charge through electrostatic induction this part of the charge can directly or indirectly participate in the catalytic degradation wang et al zhang et al 2021 also proved that the droplet teng can generate a large amount of charge but the output strategy of electrostatic induction limits the output size and a reasonable output strategy can increase the output by two orders of magnitude and after six cycles of degradation the surface of the ptfe membrane still maintains a high surface potential fig 6e up to 350 v it shows that there are still a lot of negative charges accumulated on the surface of the polymer film and the catalysis can continue the judgment of the degradation degree of the dye in addition to directly observing the color change of the dye can also be remotely monitored through the output current signal as shown in fig 6f the degradation continues the dye concentration gradually decreases and the current signal gradually decreases and shows a trend similar to fig 6c which proves that the current signal can be highly consistent with the degradation efficiency and is a reliable basis for judging the degree of degradation furthermore in addition to cv the cec system also catalyzes other dyes such as ebt figure s12 and fep and polyimide can also be used to achieve cec degradation as shown in figure s10 however there are certain differences in catalytic efficiency due to different material properties due to its excellent catalytic degradation performance cec can be regarded as a reliable method that can utilize the mechanical energy of solution to generate reactive oxygen species and more promising reaction systems involving radical species can be established in the future fig 6g 3 conclusion in summary a high efficiency cec system based on droplet teng has been successfully designed cec utilizes the gravitational potential energy of the droplet itself to achieve self driven and efficient dye degradation the process of the dye slipping off the surface of the dielectric film is the process of the dye being catalytically degraded liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms results show that cv has been degraded electron paramagnetic resonance epr results confirm the presence of hydroxyl radicals and superoxide radicals and through experiments the mechanism of cec is explored in detail which proves that the hydroxyl radicals and superoxide radicals generated in the process are the main causes of dye degradation and light is an important guarantee for cec to continue it is demonstrated that wide bandgap insulator polymers can also achieve catalysis under visible light the degradation mechanism of the dye was further verified by electrical signals at the same time it is also found that there is a certain linear relationship between the output current signal and the dye concentration the degree of dye degradation can be judged by the current signal and the self powered monitoring of the dye catalytic degradation process can be realized cec is a novel strategy that can efficiently generate ros with extremely high catalytic efficiency the rate constant k of up to 3 7 min 1 and the degradation efficiency of 90 within 38 s are a great breakthrough in the field of catalytic degradation cec a new method of catalysis is expected to play an important role in promoting the development of the field of catalytic degradation at the same time it has further expanded the application of teng in different fields showing the powerful advantages of teng 4 materials and methods 4 1 fabrication of contact electro catalysis system the cec system is mainly composed of single electrode droplet teng the ptfe film is an industrial film with a thickness of 0 1 mm which was rinsed with ethanol before each experiment the film was smoothly affixed to the aluminum foil

15359,under the limitation of the carrier yield and mobility of semiconductor photocatalysts and the reaction domain it seems that the photocatalytic efficiency cannot be greatly improved here an efficient contact electro catalysis cec system based on droplet triboelectric nanogenerator teng is developed instead of using traditional semiconductor catalysts the electric charge transferred

charge is also different and the external appearance is different current magnitude as shown in fig 4e the magnitude of the current signal in the catalytic degradation process of different concentrations of cv is different as the cv concentration decreases the current gradually decreases therefore the current signal can be used as a reliable basis for judging the degree of dye degradation this rule can also be obtained in the graph of charge transfer fig 4f the higher the concentration the more o h and o 2 involved in the reaction so the more charges are transferred 2 4 working mechanism of droplet teng for contact electro catalysis collectively fig 5 proposes a cec principle cec can be performed continuously under light fig 5a without the participation of light the electrons on the ptfe surface will gradually accumulate and eventually reach saturation and cec will also stop fig 5b the electron cloud potential well model of fig 5c and f can explain the reason why electrons transfer between two substances however the process of electron transfer is also accompanied by chemical reactions in the initial stage the dye droplet falls in contact with the uncharged polymer film making the film negatively charged and itself positively charged due to electron transfer from water molecules a water molecule losses an electron and becomes h 2 o which has a rather short life and it quickly combines with water molecules to become radicals according to lin et al 2020 loh et al 2020 h 2 o h 2 o o h h 3 o a large number of o h participate in the catalytic degradation of the dye fig 5d e when the surface of the polymer is negatively charged the surface electrons combine with o 2 in the droplet under the excitation of the photon to produce o 2 o 2 will generate o h through a chain reaction which then participates in the catalytic degradation of cv wang et al 2022 and the uncharged ptfe can continue to contact with water to realize electron transfer so as to achieve a virtuous circle fig 5g i fig 5j is the chemical equation for the formation of o h and o 2 radicals in the cec process these strong oxidizing free radicals will attack the unsaturated groups and conjugated systems in the crystal violet molecules so that the large π conjugated color system in the crystal violet molecules will gradually be degraded and destroyed become colorless and form saturated compounds or even harmless products such as water and carbon dioxide fig 5k 2 5 multiple drop outlets for ultra efficient contact electro catalysis based on a good understanding of the cec system a self powered multi droppers device that can monitor the catalytic progress is designed as shown in fig 6 a the traditional oxidation method to treat wastewater requires the catalyst to be put into the wastewater and the strong oxidizing groups o h and o 2 produced are distributed on the surface of the catalyst and its vicinity al mamun et al 2019 the uneven distribution of strong oxidizing groups in wastewater will greatly reduce the rate of catalytic degradation as for the cec system when the wastewater comes into contact with the polymer membrane drop by drop the strong oxidizing groups will be uniformly distributed in the wastewater which can greatly improve the catalytic efficiency video s1 in addition increasing the drop outlets and accelerating the dripping speed of waste water can further increase the catalytic rate when the number of drip openings increased from one to 16 the catalytic speed was greatly improved and the cv absorbance dropped sharply within 38 s fig 6b and the absorption peak of the benzene ring at 230 nm the absorption peak of the polar and unsaturated functional groups and the conjugated system of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons at 310 nm gradually weakened or even disappeared the transient enhancement in the middle may be caused by the increased absorption of small molecules containing benzene ring structures due to the destruction of the large conjugated system from the optical photo in the inset of fig 6c it can also be seen that the cv solution is almost colorless at 38 s the degradation efficiency of cv reaches 90 the reaction kinetics can be treated as pseudo first order and can be written as follow 1 ln c 0 c k t the rate constant k value can be derived from the plot of ln c0 c versus t fig 6d through linear fitting the rate constant k value is calculated to be 3 7 min 1 which is much larger than reported in previous work tables s1 and s2 such high catalytic efficiency is due to the high amount of charge generated by contact electrification although it is impossible to transfer such a large amount of charge through electrostatic induction this part of the charge can directly or indirectly participate in the catalytic degradation wang et al zhang et al 2021 also proved that the droplet teng can generate a large amount of charge but the output strategy of electrostatic induction limits the output size and a reasonable output strategy can increase the output by two orders of magnitude and after six cycles of degradation the surface of the ptfe membrane still maintains a high surface potential fig 6e up to 350 v it shows that there are still a lot of negative charges accumulated on the surface of the polymer film and the catalysis can continue the judgment of the degradation degree of the dye in addition to directly observing the color change of the dye can also be remotely monitored through the output current signal as shown in fig 6f the degradation continues the dye concentration gradually decreases and the current signal gradually decreases and shows a trend similar to fig 6c which proves that the current signal can be highly consistent with the degradation efficiency and is a reliable basis for judging the degree of degradation furthermore in addition to cv the cec system also catalyzes other dyes such as ebt figure s12 and fep and polyimide can also be used to achieve cec degradation as shown in figure s10 however there are certain differences in catalytic efficiency due to different material properties due to its excellent catalytic degradation performance cec can be regarded as a reliable method that can utilize the mechanical energy of solution to generate reactive oxygen species and more promising reaction systems involving radical species can be established in the future fig 6g 3 conclusion in summary a high efficiency cec system based on droplet teng has been successfully designed cec utilizes the gravitational potential energy of the droplet itself to achieve self driven and efficient dye degradation the process of the dye slipping off the surface of the dielectric film is the process of the dye being catalytically degraded liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms results show that cv has been degraded electron paramagnetic resonance epr results confirm the presence of hydroxyl radicals and superoxide radicals and through experiments the mechanism of cec is explored in detail which proves that the hydroxyl radicals and superoxide radicals generated in the process are the main causes of dye degradation and light is an important guarantee for cec to continue it is demonstrated that wide bandgap insulator polymers can also achieve catalysis under visible light the degradation mechanism of the dye was further verified by electrical signals at the same time it is also found that there is a certain linear relationship between the output current signal and the dye concentration the degree of dye degradation can be judged by the current signal and the self powered monitoring of the dye catalytic degradation process can be realized cec is a novel strategy that can efficiently generate ros with extremely high catalytic efficiency the rate constant k of up to 3 7 min 1 and the degradation efficiency of 90 within 38 s are a great breakthrough in the field of catalytic degradation cec a new method of catalysis is expected to play an important role in promoting the development of the field of catalytic degradation at the same time it has further expanded the application of teng in different fields showing the powerful advantages of teng 4 materials and methods 4 1 fabrication of contact electro catalysis system the cec system is mainly composed of single electrode droplet teng the ptfe film is an industrial film with a thickness of 0 1 mm which was rinsed with ethanol before each experiment the film was smoothly affixed to the aluminum foil
