15545,organohalide pollutants are prevalent in the environment causing harms to wildlife and human organohalide respiring bacteria ohrb could detoxify these pollutants in anaerobic environments but the most competent ohrb i e dehalococcoides is susceptible to oxygen this study reports exceptional resistance and resilience of sewage sludge microbial communities to oxygen stress for attenuation of structurally distinct organohalide pollutants including tetrachloroethene tetrabromobisphenol a and polybrominated diphenyl ethers the dehalogenation rate constant of these organohalide pollutants in oxygen exposed sludge microcosms was maintained as 74 120 as that in the control without oxygen exposure subsequent top down experiments clarified that sludge flocs and non ohrb contributed to alleviating oxygen stress on ohrb in the dehalogenating microcosms multiple ohrb dehahlococcoides dehalogenimonas and sulfurospirillum harboring distinct reductive dehalogenase genes pcea ptea tcea vcra and bdea collaborated to detoxify organohalide pollutants but responded differentially to oxygen stress comprehensive microbial community analyses taxonomy diversity and structure demonstrated certain resilience of the sludge derived dehalogenating microbial communities to oxygen stress additionally microbial co occurrence networks were intensified by oxygen stress in most microcosms as a possible stress mitigation strategy altogether the mechanistic and ecological findings in this study contribute to remediation of organohalide contaminated sites encountering oxygen disturbance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewage sludge microbial reductive dehalogenation organohalide pollutants oxygen stress community resilience microbial ecology data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction a variety of organohalide compounds are manufactured for diverse applications such as solvents pesticides and flame retardants improper disposal of wastes containing these compounds and inadvertent emission from legacy sources e g landfill and wastewater treatment plants have led to their prevalent contamination in the environment atashgahi et al 2017 he et al 2021 xu et al 2022b xu et al 2021a recognition of the persistence and severe harms of many organohalide pollutants to human and wildlife has led researchers to investigate their attenuation in the environment ding et al 2017 he et al 2006 voordeckers et al 2002 zhao et al 2022 zhu et al 2014 an efficient process to attenuate organohalide pollutants in anaerobic environments is microbial reductive dehalogenation which is mediated by reductive dehalogenases rdases synthesized by organohalide respiring bacteria ohrb loffler et al 2013 wang et al 2018 xu et al 2019 yang et al 2017 yu et al 2018 zhao et al 2022 most ohrb particularly dehalococcoides are obligate anaerobic bacteria which are susceptible to oxygen due to the lack of enzymes to detoxify reactive oxygen species loffler et al 2013 lu and imlay 2021 this is evidenced by the severe and irreversible inhibition on dechlorination activity after oxygen exposure on dehalococcoides isolates and highly enriched commercial consortia adrian et al 2007 amos et al 2008 he et al 2003 the detrimental effects of oxygen are also relevant to field bioremediation as implicated by the negative correlation between dissolved oxygen and dehalococcoides abundance during bioremediation of contaminated sites atashgahi et al 2017 weatherill et al 2019 the concentration of dissolved oxygen could range from undetectable to approximately 6 mg l at contaminated sites such as underground water and sediments atashgahi et al 2017 weatherill et al 2019 the high sensitivity of dehalococcoides to oxygen suggests that efforts are deserved to control oxygen exposure during dehalococcoides based bioremediation however microbial reductive dehalogenation activity was also reported to partially recover after oxygen exposure in some cases where the initial concentration of oxygen was up to 7 2 mg l liu et al 2017 the extensive dechlorination of tetrachloroethene pce and polychlorinated biphenyls in microcosms inoculated with activated sludge that had been continuously exposed to high level of oxygen also implicates successful maintenance of metabolic activity of ohrb cells under oxygen stress in activated sludge lu et al 2021 xu et al 2021b however the strategy for ohrb to survive under oxygen stress in these reports remain to be clarified understanding of which may provide valuable information to mitigate oxygen inhibition during cultivation of the fastidious ohrb as well as their application in bioremediation microbial communities in soil sediments and biofilm usually exhibit certain levels of resistance and resilience to environmental stress namely the ecosystems could completely or partially resist and recover from a perturbation to maintain their structures and functions chen et al 2021 feng et al 2017 huang et al 2020 many factors including differences between microbial habitats community composition and microbial interactions could affect the resistance and resilience of microbial communities bardgett and caruso 2020 bouskill et al 2013 in dehalogenating consortia and contaminated sites non ohrb populations such as fermenters and methanogens broadly co exist with ohrb which could provide beneficial nutrients or create favorable niches for ohrb liu et al 2017 lu et al 2021 xu et al 2022a yuan et al 2021a the co existence of diverse microbial populations and their intensive interactions may improve resistance and resilience of dehalogenating microbial communities to environmental stress although extensive efforts have been made to investigate resistance and resilience of microbial communities associated with biological carbon and nitrogen cycling to environmental disturbance in a variety of ecosystems bardgett and caruso 2020 bouskill et al 2013 huang et al 2020 evaluation of the resistance and resilience of organohalide dehalogenating microbial communities in response to environmental disturbance e g oxygen stress and the controlling biotic and abiotic factors is still limited this study investigates efficient onset of microbial reductive dehalogenation of pce tetrabromonbisphenol a tbbpa and polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes in sewage sludge microcosms under oxygen stress to elucidate the strategy for anaerobic ohrb including dehalococcoides to survive under oxygen stress in sewage sludge a top down strategy is employed to simplify the dehalogenating sewage sludge microcosms by stepwise exclusion of sludge flocs and non ohrb the influence of oxygen stress on microbial reductive dehalogenation was also studied in these manipulated dehalogenating cultures to clarify the separate roles of sludge floc and non ohrb populations in maintaining dehalogenation activity under oxygen stress the abundance of ohrb and rdase genes potentially involved in dehalogenation are monitored to reveal their responses to oxygen stress the resistance and resilience of dehalogenating microbial communities is also evaluated by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing based analyses lastly the succession of microbial co occurrence networks and community assembly with increasing oxygen stress were analyzed to provide more ecological insights into the impacts of oxygen stress on dehalogenating microbial communities 2 materials and methods 2 1 setup of microbial cultures and oxygen stress tests sewage sludge was sampled from an aeration tank in a municipal wastewater treatment plant in singapore and transported to laboratory on ice wang et al 2019 the median diameter of sludge flocs was 6 5 0 1 µm fig s1 the sewage sludge was concentrated by centrifugation 12 000 g 15 min and 4 c which was continuously aerated for different duration i e 0 1 3 6 and 24 h dissolved oxygen 5 mg l and inoculated into 100 ml serum bottles

as previously described except that the concentration of na2s 9h2o was decreased to 0 05 mm to minimize abiotic consumption of oxygen xu et al 2022b the headspace of serum bottles was filled with either sterilized nitrogen or air after inoculation corresponding to an initial dissolved oxygen concentration of 0 and 8 mg l assuming equilibrium partitioning respectively based on the aeration

usa were spiked to the serum bottles tbbpa was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide 367 7 mm whereas penta bdes were dissolved in 2 2 4 trimethylpentane 14 0 mm to prepare the stock solutions lactate 10 mm was amended as carbon source and electron donor the sewage sludge microcosms were sub cultured with pce 0 5 mm via consecutive transfers 5 v v in the same medium to decrease the concentration of sludge flocs the sub cultured sewage sludge microcosm with a sludge concentration of 0 2 g l denoted as ss0 2 one subculturing and enrichment mixed cultures without sludge floc denoted as floc free mixed culture 5 consecutive subculturing were also subjected to oxygen stress tests as abovementioned the floc free mixed culture was subjected to microscopic analysis to verify that sludge flocs were eliminated fig s3 pce 0 5 mm and lactate 10 mm were spiked to the ss0 2 microcosms and floc free mixed cultures to further exclude non ohrb that could biologically deplete oxygen in the dehalogenating cultures a co culture consisting of dehalococcoides mccartyi strains 11a5 harboring ptea and tcea and 11a harboring tcea and vcra lee et al 2013 low et al 2015 was established in the same mineral salt

were setup with triplicates and incubated stationarily in the dark unless stated otherwise dehalogenation activity was monitored periodically cell pellets were collected by centrifuging 1 ml samples

sequencing analyses genomic dna gdna extraction was performed using the dneasy powersoil pro kit and dneasy blood and tissue kit qiagen hilden germany for cell pellets collected from sludge microcosms and sludge free cultures respectively amplification of the v4 v5 regions of 16s rrna genes in gdna was performed using the u515f u909r primers as previously reported liang et al 2021 amplicon sequencing was performed on an illumina novaseq 6000 platform san diego ca usa in novogene ait singapore demultiplexed sequencing data was filtered and denoised followed by chimera removal and amplicon sequence variants asvs identification using dada2 callahan et al 2016 mafft was used to align the asvs katoh et al 2002 stamatakis 2014 taxonomic identification was performed by assigning the asvs against the silva138 database using the q2 feature classifier classify sklearn bokulich et al 2018 quast et al 2013 the qiime2 plugin q2 diversity was used to calculate microbial diversity 2 3 community co occurrence networks and assembly microbial co occurrence networks were separately constructed for microbial communities under each level of oxygen stress based on the reported method ju et al 2014 to improve reliability of correlation calculation only otus that were detected in at least half of the samples were included for each group yuan et al 2021b the spearman s correlation coefficient was calculated to assess the correlations among different microbial populations ju et al 2014 correlations with a coefficient 0 6 and p value 0 01 adjusted using the benjamini hochberg method to reduce false positive correlations were considered statistically significant r packages vegan v2 5 7 dixon 2003 igraph v1 2 6 csardi and nepusz 2006 and hmisc v4 5 0 harrell 2021 were used to perform all network analyses the networks were visualized with gephi v0 9 2 bastian et al 2009 both stochastic and deterministic processes contribute to community assembly ning et al 2019 to infer the proportion of each process in governing community assembly the modified stochasticity ratio mst was estimated using the nst package as previously described ning et al 2019 bray curtis metrics was used for mst estimation during null model analysis 1000 times randomization was run a cutoff value of 50 was set as the boundary value for mst stochastic processes are predicted to play more important roles in community assembly when mst is 50 whereas deterministic processes overwhelm stochastic processes when mst is 50 2 4 quantitative pcr qpcr an abi 7500 fast real time pcr system abi foster city ca usa was used to perform qpcr as reported xu et al 2022b genus and gene specific primers table s1 were used to quantify the abundance of ohrb and rdase genes behrens et al 2008 ding et al 2017 freeborn et al 2005 grostern and edwards 2006 johnson et al 2005 manchester et al 2012 wang et al 2014 xu et al 2022c zhao et al 2021 the plasmids with target amplicons were constructed using the pgem

distribution of sewage sludge flocs was measured using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer ls i3 320 beckman coulter usa as previously described wang et al 2021a pbdes and tbbpa were extracted by liquid liquid extraction as reported xu et al 2022b the extracted tbbpa was derivatized with n o bis trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetamide by incubation at 70 c for 40 min prior measurement ramaswamy et al 2021 a gas chromatography gc 6890n mass spectrometry system msd 5975 agilent equipped with a db 5ms column 15 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm agilent was sued to measure pbdes tbbpa and their dehalogenation products as described ramaswamy et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 chlorinated ethenes were detected on a gc 7890a agilent installed with a flame ionization detector and a gs gaspro column 30 m 0 32 mm 0 25 μm j w scientific folsom ca usa chen and he 2018 to obtain the dehalogenation rate constant average chlorine per chlorinated ethene cl ce and average bromine per bromobisphenol a br bbpa and brominated diphenyl ether br bde were calculated to include halogens removed from all steps of dehalogenation and fitted to the first order equation l n c t c 0 k t where c0 and ct are the average halogens per organohalide at time 0 and t respectively 2 6 data deposition raw illumina novaseq sequencing reads were deposited into ncbi with an accession number of prjna839544 3 results 3 1 efficient microbial reductive dehalogenation in sewage sludge under oxygen stress to determine the resilience of microbial reductive dehalogenation to oxygen stress in sewage sludge microcosms were established with sewage sludge 4 g l sludge ss4 and exposed to various levels of oxygen increasing oxygen stress from l0 to l5 fig s2 more than 50 pce was dechlorinated to ethene within 60 days in the ss4 microcosms under all oxygen stress levels which could be fitted to the first order equation r2 0 83 figs 1 a c and s4a only high oxygen stress showed obvious inhibition on pce dechlorination in the ss4 microcosms with the pce dechlorination rate constant slightly decreasing from 0 039 0 001 d 1 to 0 029 0 003 d 1 when oxygen stress increased from l0 to l5 respectively fig 1d nonetheless the pce dechlorination rate constant in the ss4 microcosms under the highest oxygen stress l5 was still as 74 2 as that in the control microcosm l0 the influence of oxygen stress on microbial reductive debromination of tbbpa and pbdes were also studied in the ss4 microcosms spiked with both tbbpa and pbdes tbbpa debromination could also be fitted to the first order equation r2 0 80 figs 2 a c and s5a similarly oxygen stress showed minimal inhibition on tbbpa debromination slightly decreasing the debromination rate constant from 0 164 0 005 d 1 to 0 138 0 002 d 1 when the oxygen stress increased from l0 to l5 respectively fig 2d nevertheless over 90 tbbpa was completely debrominated to bpa within 30 days in all ss4 microcosms the onset of pbde debromination was generally observed after day 30 when tbbpa debromination almost reached the highest extent fig 3 a c oxygen stress did not significantly p 0 05 suppress or stimulate pbde debromination in the ss4 microcosms with the debromination rate constant in oxygen exposed ss4 microcosms as 95 114 as that in the control fig 3d at the end of incubation pbdes were predominantly debrominated to tri and tetra bde congeners bde 17 49 and 50 by preferential removal of the para and ortho bromines with minor diphenyl ether produced 2 3 fig 3e collectively these results suggested exceptional survival of ohrb in sewage sludge to perform microbial reductive dehalogenation under oxygen stress it is also noteworthy that the same sewage sludge microbiota was capable of dehalogenating multiple structurally distinct organohalide pollutants 3 2 survival strategy of ohrb under oxygen stress to elucidate mechanisms underlying the exceptional survival of ohrb in sewage sludge to perform microbial reductive dehalogenation under oxygen stress a top down strategy was employed to simplify the pce dechlorinating sewage sludge microcosms by stepwise exclusion of sludge flocs and non ohrb these manipulated dechlorinating cultures were subjected to oxygen stress tests to discern the separate roles of sludge flocs and non ohrb in maintaining dechlorination activity under oxygen stress in the sub cultured sludge microcosms with 0 2 g l sludge flocs ss0 2 over 90 pce was dechlorinated to ethene within 60 days under all the tested oxygen stress fig 4 a surprisingly oxygen stress significantly stimulated pce dechlorination to ethene in most ss0 2 microcosms for example the pce dechlorination rate constant was increased by 53 2 at statistically significant level p 0 05 in the ss0 2 microcosm under oxygen stress l4 compared with the control fig 4d however in the enriched floc free mixed cultures where sludge flocs were eliminated elevating oxygen stress severely inhibited pce dechlorination the pce dechlorination rate constant significantly p 0 05 decreased from 0 225 0 011 to 0 044 0 003 d 1 when the oxygen stress increased from l0 to l5 fig 4b and d suggesting the crucial role of sludge flocs in protecting ohrb under oxygen stress nevertheless pce could be still detoxified to ethene in the floc free mixed cultures even under the highest oxygen stress after extended incubation fig 4b however oxygen stress completely inhibited microbial reductive dechlorination of pce in the defined co culture consisting of d mccartyi strains 11a5 and 11a fig 4c and d indicating the indispensable contribution of non ohrb in recovering dechlorination activity after oxygen exposure these observations indicate that sludge flocs and non ohrb populations play critical roles in maintaining microbial reductive dehalogenation activity in sewage sludge microbial communities under oxygen stress 3 3 differential responses of ohrb harboring distinct rdase genes to oxygen stress to elucidate the responses of ohrb and rdase genes to oxygen stress the known ohrb and rdase genes capable of dehalogenating tbbpa pbdes and pce were assayed in the dehalogenating cultures dehalococcoides and dehalogenimonas were detected as the dominant ohrb in the ss4 microcosms debrominating tbbpa and pbdes at the end of incubation fig s6 the abundance of which also increased with dehalogenation fig 5 a suggesting their involvement in debromination interestingly elevating oxygen stress preferentially selected dehalogenimonas over dehalococcoides fig 5a this was likely attributed to the higher tolerance of dehalogenimonas to oxygen exposure than dehalococcoides adrian et al 2007 yan et al 2009 the currently known tbbpa rdase gene pcba1 was detected at low abundance 3 0 102 copies ml fig s7a implicating the involvement of novel rdase s in tbbpa debromination in the ss4 microcosms contrarily the recently reported pbde rdase genes ptea tcea and bdea zhao et al 2022 zhao et al 2021 were detected at relatively higher abundance 105 copies ml in most microcosms which also showed positive correlations r 0 55 p 0 01 with pbde debromination figs s7 and s8 notably ptea tcea and bdea were co dominant in microcosms under oxygen stress l0 l3 whereas bdea was solely predominant in ss4 microcosms under the highest oxygen stress l5 fig s7a suggesting the selection of different pbde debrominating dehalococcoides strains by oxygen stress in the ss4 microcosms spiked with pce the cell abundance of dehalococcoides 3 0 106 4 0 107 cells ml was over one order of magnitude higher than that of dehalogenimonas 1 4 105 2 6 105 cells ml and dehalobacter undetectable on day 60 when pce dechlorination almost reached the highest extent fig s6b increasing oxygen stress initially suppressed growth of dehalococcoides as reflected by the slower increase and lower maximum cell abundance of dehalococcoides in the oxygen exposed ss4 microcosms than the control nonetheless the cell abundance of dehalococcoides increased and showed positive correlation with dechlorination during incubation of all ss4 microcosms spiked with pce figs 5b and s8c however it is notable that dehalococcoides was nondetectable during day 0 8 when pce was only partially dechlorinated to dces suggesting the involvement of other ohrb in pce to dces dechlorination sulfurospirillum harboring pcea gene pceasul grew in most ss4 microcosms the abundance of which was positively correlated r 0 80 p 0 01 with pce to dces dechlorination figs 5b and s8c indicating collaboration between sulfurospirillum and dehalococcoides for complete detoxification of pce to ethene similarly the growth of dehalococcoides was initially inhibited by oxygen stress in the sub cultured ss0 2 microcosms and floc free mixed cultures fig 5c d unexpectedly sulfurospirillum was phased out in the floc free mixed cultures likely caused by the favored proliferation of dehalococcoides and continued decay of sulfurospirillum due to long incubation time between subculturing 30 40 days diverse known rdase genes capable of dechlorinating chloroethenes were identified in the pce dechlorinating microcosms which showed obvious succession with oxygen stress in the pce dechlorinating ss4 microcosms pceasul and ptea collaboratively but ptea alone dechlorinated pce to tce under oxygen stress l0 l3 and l5 respectively the canonical rdases genes capable of dechlorinating dces to ethene vcra and bvca were detected at low levels whereas tcea was abundant and likely responsible for tce to ethene dechlorination fig 5b similar observations were also found in the sub cultured ss0 2 microcosms and floc free mixed cultures except that vcra emerged but pceasul was phased out in the floc free mixed cultures fig 5c d collectively these results showed that multiple ohrb harboring distinct rdase genes could survive in the sludge derived microcosms under oxygen stress for detoxification of organohalide pollutants and oxygen stress affected their growth and inter and intra species collaboration and competition 3 4 resilience of dehalogenating microbial communities to oxygen stress the microbial communities were also analyzed by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing to elucidate community level responses to oxygen stress microbial diversity quantified by shannon diversity and evenness in most dehalogenating microcosms exposed to oxygen initially showed different extents of deviation from that in the control microcosms nonetheless it gradually converged during incubation fig 6 a and b notably oxygen stress altered microbial diversity more dramatically away from the control in the sub cultured ss0 2 microcosms and floc free mixed cultures than the raw ss4 sludge microcosms suggesting the higher resistance and resilience of microbial communities in the latter the deviation of microbial diversity generally increased with elevating oxygen stress e g the maximum decrease of shannon diversity increased from 0 88 to 2 14 when the oxygen stress increased from l1 to l5 in the sub cultured ss0 2 microcosms fig 6a similarly the bray curtis dissimilarity between oxygen exposed microbial communities and the control increased at the beginning and decreased thereafter further demonstrating the resilience of dehalogenating microbial communities in response to oxygen stress fig 6c the maximum bray curtis dissimilarity values were higher in the sub cultured ss0 2 microcosms 0 60 0 67 and floc free cultures 0 58 0 72 than that in the ss4 microcosms 0 19 0 49 this indicated that the microbial communities in the ss4 microcosms were more resistant to oxygen disturbance than that in the sub cultured ss0 2 microcosms and floc free cultures more detailed analysis revealed obvious succession of microbial populations during the enrichment process with the extinction of bacteroidetes vadinha17 saprospiraceae c10 sb1a and caldilineaceae but enrichment of lentimicrobium dehalococcoides aeromonas and sphaerochaeta during subculturing fig 7 nevertheless the dominant microbial populations were similar in each type of microcosms exposed to different levels of oxygen stress the relative abundance of which also showed similar temporal trends demonstrating the resistance of dehalogenating sewage sludge microbial communities to oxygen stress to further determine whether potential microbial interactions were affected by oxygen stress microbial co occurrence network analysis was performed in the ss4 microcosms network complexity was considerably increased by oxygen stress as supported by the more nodes and edges higher average degree and graph density in the oxygen exposed ss4 microcosms compared with that in the control fig 8 a b and e similar trends were also observed in the sub cultured ss0 2 microcosms fig 8c and e however the microbial co occurrence network was obviously intensified only in the floc free mixed cultures under the highest oxygen stress compared with the control fig 8d and e community assembly analysis showed that the modified stochastic ratio mst in the ss4 microcosms 27 1 4 9 was much lower than that in the floc free mixed cultures 53 6 7 2 fig 8f this means that deterministic processes e g biological interactions played overwhelming roles in community assembly in the initial ss4 microcosms whereas stochastic processes contributed equally as deterministic processes to community assembly in the floc free mixed cultures in line with the observed higher mst values during the enrichment stage where the dominance of either ohrb fermenters and methanogens depended on the complicated stochastic processes qiu et al 2020 in general the mst values initially decreased with elevating oxygen stress but which increased when oxygen stress was higher than the threshold levels implicating level dependent effects of oxygen stress on assembly of dehalogenating microbial communities 4 discussion this study found that the same sewage sludge microbiota was capable of dehalogenating structurally distinct organohalide pollutants including pce tbbpa and pbdes correspondingly multiple known ohrb and rdase genes were detected in the sludge microcosms which collaborated to dehalogenate the tested organohalide pollutants together with extensive dehalogenation of pcbs triclosan and several fluorinated organic compounds by sewage sludge microbiota in previous reports bertin et al 2007 che et al 2021 xu et al 2021b zhang et al 2013 zhao et al 2020 it suggests that sewage sludge from municipal wastewater treatment plants might be an ideal source to obtain competent microbial cultures for detoxification of organohalide pollutants ohrb are usually sensitive to oxygen however in this study anaerobic ohrb including dehalococcoides could survive in sewage sludge derived microcosms under high oxygen stress and maintain their dehalogenation activity either with or without sludge flocs the oxygen stress posed on the dehalogenating microbial communities in this study was remarkably higher than that in previous reports amos et al 2008 liu et al 2017 the dehalogenating microbial communities were continuously aerated for up to 24 h and the headspace was filled with air in the cultures corresponding to approximately 8 mg l dissolved oxygen in this study which is much higher than the oxygen stress tested in previous studies of 20 oxygen in the headspace 7 2 mg l dissolved oxygen without continuous aeration amos et al 2008 liu et al 2017 despite such high levels of oxygen stress in our current study ohrb including dehalococcoides could survive to efficiently dehalogenate diverse organohalide pollutants for the sewage sludge microcosms initial exposure to nearly saturated concentration of dissolved oxygen i e 8 mg l inhibited dehalogenation activity by less than 30 the outstanding survival of ohrb in sewage sludge microcosms under high oxygen stress is likely attributed to physical shielding by sludge flocs and rapid depletion of oxygen by non ohrb as suggested by our comprehensive top down experiments as well as previous reports liu et al 2017 wang et al 2016 this might be a common strategy for ohrb and other anaerobic microorganisms to survive in surficial environments where oxygen disturbance occurs such as riverbed hyporheic zones and surface water atashgahi et al 2013 lu and imlay 2021 wang et al 2021b weatherill et al 2018 however it requires further investigation to determine the threshold size of sludge flocs for effective protection of ohrb during oxygen exposure and the variation of oxygen within sludge flocs the understanding of the strategy that ohrb employed to survive under oxygen stress could benefit laboratory cultivation and bioremediation application of anaerobic microbial cultures detoxifying organohalide pollutants for example certain microbial diversity could be maintained in the dehalogenating cultures to keep non ohrb populations to consume oxygen in case that oxygen disturbance occurs during cultivation and bioaugmentation meanwhile stimulating the formation of biofilm or aggregates could be adopted during production of bioinoculants for bioaugmentation payne et al 2017 2019 which may decrease direct oxygen exposure to ohrb however more in depth biomolecular insights into the resilience of microbial reductive dehalogenation to oxygen stress requires further investigation recent studies revealed that several obligate anaerobes e g geobacter bacteroides and clostridium have evolved tactics to minimize the extent to which oxygen disrupts their metabolism or restore function shortly after stress removal baughn and malamy 2004 lin et al 2004 lu and imlay 2021 a substantial number of these putative obligate anaerobes use superoxide reductases to detoxify reactive oxygen species some of which even possess o2 directed respiratory systems as an oxygen defensive or energy generating system baughn and malamy 2004 lin et al 2004 lu and imlay 2021 it warrants efforts to confirm whether the ohrb particularly dehalococcoides dwelling in the aerobic sewage sludge have evolved such features microorganisms are key players underpinning ecosystem functions such as biogeochemical cycling of carbon nitrogen and sulfur elements repeta et al 2016 shi et al 2020 tian et al 2020 wu et al 2019 therefore the ability of microbial communities to withstand environmental stress and maintain their functions is critical to ecosystem stability and prediction of ecosystem functioning in the changing environment bardgett and caruso 2020 huang et al 2020 philippot et al 2021 this study evaluates the resistance and resilience of organohalide dehalogenating microbial communities to oxygen stress despite that the diversity and structure of microbial communities were initially altered by oxygen stress they gradually converged during incubation demonstrating certain resilience of the dehalogenating communities to oxygen disturbance the microbial diversity in most microcosms encountering oxygen stress completely recovered to be the same as that in the control microcosms after different periods of incubation whereas the community structure quantified by bray curtis dissimilarity stabilized at an alternative state that was different from the control microcosms at the end of incubation this suggests the necessity to evaluate community resilience using multiple metrics notably we found that both abiotic and biotic factors likely determine the resistance and resilience of dehalogenating microbial communities to oxygen stress for example the microbial communities in sewage sludge microcosms with high concentration of sludge flocs more deterministic community assembly and high biodiversity and network complexity exhibited higher resistance and resilience to oxygen disturbance this is consistent with the profound influence of abiotic and biotic factors on the resilience of microbial communities decomposing plant residues griffiths et al 2007 in addition intensified microbial network is likely a general response of dehalogenating microbial communities to oxygen stress which may contribute to mitigating the stress collectively this study provides unprecedented mechanistic and ecological insights into the resistance and resilience of dehalogenating microbial communities to oxygen stress these findings shed lights on developing ohrb based bioremediation technologies to better remediate organohalide pollutants at sites encountering oxygen disturbance 5 conclusions sewage sludge microbiota could dehalogenate structurally distinct organohalide pollutants including pce tbbpa and pbdes organohalide respiring bacteria in sewage sludge maintained their metabolic activity under high oxygen stress owing to shielding by sludge flocs and microbial depletion of oxygen diverse organohalide respiring bacteria harboring distinct reductive dehalogenase genes collaborated to detoxify organohalide pollutants but responded differentially to oxygen stress the dehalogenating sewage sludge microbial communities showed certain resistance and resilience to oxygen disturbance these findings contribute to better bioremediation of organohalide pollutants employing ohrb in environments with oxygen disturbance supplementary materials additional

15545,organohalide pollutants are prevalent in the environment causing harms to wildlife and human organohalide respiring bacteria ohrb could detoxify these pollutants in anaerobic environments but the most competent ohrb i e dehalococcoides is susceptible to oxygen this study reports exceptional resistance and resilience of sewage sludge microbial communities to oxygen stress for attenuation of structurally distinct organohalide pollutants including tetrachloroethene tetrabromobisphenol a and polybrominated diphenyl ethers the dehalogenation rate constant of these organohalide pollutants in oxygen exposed sludge microcosms was maintained as 74 120 as that in the control without oxygen exposure subsequent top down experiments clarified that sludge flocs and non ohrb contributed to alleviating oxygen stress on ohrb in the dehalogenating microcosms multiple ohrb dehahlococcoides dehalogenimonas and sulfurospirillum harboring distinct reductive dehalogenase genes pcea ptea tcea vcra and bdea collaborated to detoxify organohalide pollutants but responded differentially to oxygen stress comprehensive microbial community analyses taxonomy diversity and structure demonstrated

graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewage sludge microbial reductive dehalogenation organohalide pollutants oxygen stress community resilience microbial ecology data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction a variety of organohalide compounds are manufactured for diverse applications such as solvents pesticides and flame retardants improper disposal of wastes containing these compounds and inadvertent emission from legacy sources e g landfill and wastewater treatment plants have led to their prevalent contamination in the environment atashgahi et al 2017 he et al 2021 xu et al 2022b xu et al 2021a recognition of the persistence and severe harms of many organohalide pollutants to human and wildlife has led researchers to investigate their attenuation in the environment ding et al 2017 he et al 2006 voordeckers et al 2002 zhao et al 2022 zhu et al 2014 an efficient process to attenuate organohalide pollutants in anaerobic environments is microbial reductive dehalogenation which is mediated by reductive dehalogenases rdases synthesized by organohalide respiring bacteria ohrb loffler et al 2013 wang et al 2018 xu et al 2019 yang et al 2017 yu et al 2018 zhao et al 2022 most ohrb particularly dehalococcoides are obligate anaerobic bacteria which are susceptible to oxygen due to the lack of enzymes to detoxify reactive oxygen species loffler et al 2013 lu and imlay 2021 this is evidenced by the severe and irreversible inhibition on dechlorination activity after oxygen exposure on dehalococcoides isolates and highly enriched commercial consortia adrian et al 2007 amos et al 2008 he et al 2003 the detrimental effects of oxygen are also relevant to field bioremediation as implicated by the negative correlation between dissolved oxygen and dehalococcoides abundance during bioremediation of contaminated sites atashgahi et al 2017 weatherill et al 2019 the concentration of dissolved oxygen could range from undetectable to approximately 6 mg l at contaminated sites such as underground water and sediments atashgahi et al 2017 weatherill et al 2019 the high sensitivity of dehalococcoides to oxygen suggests that efforts are deserved to control oxygen exposure during dehalococcoides based bioremediation however microbial reductive dehalogenation activity was also reported to partially recover after oxygen exposure in some cases where the initial concentration of oxygen was up to 7 2 mg l liu et al 2017 the extensive dechlorination of tetrachloroethene pce and polychlorinated biphenyls in microcosms inoculated with activated sludge that had been continuously exposed to high level of oxygen also implicates successful maintenance of metabolic activity of ohrb cells under oxygen stress in activated sludge lu et al 2021 xu et al 2021b however the strategy for ohrb to survive under oxygen stress in these reports remain to be clarified understanding of which may provide valuable information to mitigate oxygen inhibition during cultivation of the fastidious ohrb as well as their application in bioremediation microbial communities in soil sediments and biofilm usually exhibit certain levels of resistance and resilience to environmental stress namely the ecosystems could completely or partially resist and recover from a perturbation to maintain their structures and functions chen et al 2021 feng et al 2017 huang et al 2020 many factors including differences between microbial habitats community composition and microbial interactions could affect the resistance and resilience of microbial communities bardgett and caruso 2020 bouskill et al 2013 in dehalogenating consortia and contaminated sites non ohrb populations such as fermenters and methanogens broadly co exist with ohrb which could provide beneficial nutrients or create favorable niches for ohrb liu et al 2017 lu et al 2021 xu et al 2022a yuan et al 2021a the co existence of diverse microbial populations and their intensive interactions may improve resistance and resilience of dehalogenating microbial communities to environmental stress although extensive efforts have been made to investigate resistance and resilience of microbial communities associated with biological carbon and nitrogen cycling to environmental disturbance in a variety of ecosystems bardgett and caruso 2020 bouskill et al 2013 huang et al 2020 evaluation of the resistance and resilience of organohalide dehalogenating microbial communities in response to environmental disturbance e g oxygen stress and the controlling biotic and abiotic factors is still limited this study investigates efficient onset of microbial reductive dehalogenation of pce tetrabromonbisphenol a tbbpa and polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes in sewage sludge microcosms under oxygen stress to elucidate the strategy for anaerobic ohrb including dehalococcoides to survive under oxygen stress in sewage sludge a top down strategy is employed to simplify the dehalogenating sewage sludge microcosms by stepwise exclusion of sludge flocs and non ohrb the influence of oxygen stress on microbial reductive dehalogenation was also studied in these manipulated dehalogenating cultures to clarify the separate roles of sludge floc and non ohrb populations in maintaining dehalogenation activity under oxygen stress the abundance of ohrb and rdase genes potentially involved in dehalogenation are monitored to reveal their responses to oxygen stress the resistance and resilience of dehalogenating microbial communities is also evaluated by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing based analyses lastly the succession of microbial co occurrence networks and community assembly with increasing oxygen stress were analyzed to provide more ecological insights into the impacts of oxygen stress on dehalogenating microbial communities 2 materials and methods 2 1 setup of microbial cultures and oxygen stress tests sewage sludge was sampled from an aeration tank in a municipal wastewater treatment plant in singapore and transported to laboratory on ice wang et al 2019 the median diameter of sludge flocs was 6 5 0 1 µm fig s1 the sewage sludge was concentrated by centrifugation 12 000 g 15 min and 4 c which was continuously aerated for different duration i e 0 1 3 6 and 24 h dissolved oxygen 5 mg l and inoculated into 100 ml serum bottles

as previously described except that the concentration of na2s 9h2o was decreased to 0 05 mm to minimize abiotic consumption of oxygen xu et al 2022b the headspace of serum bottles was filled with either sterilized nitrogen or air after inoculation corresponding to an initial dissolved oxygen concentration of 0 and 8 mg l assuming equilibrium partitioning respectively based on the aeration

usa were spiked to the serum bottles tbbpa was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide 367 7 mm whereas penta bdes were dissolved in 2 2 4 trimethylpentane 14 0 mm to prepare the stock solutions lactate 10 mm was amended as carbon source and electron donor the sewage sludge microcosms were sub cultured with pce 0 5 mm via consecutive transfers 5 v v in the same medium to decrease the concentration of sludge flocs the sub cultured sewage sludge microcosm with a sludge concentration of 0 2 g l denoted as ss0 2 one subculturing and enrichment mixed cultures without sludge floc denoted as floc free mixed culture 5 consecutive subculturing were also subjected to oxygen stress tests as abovementioned the floc free mixed culture was subjected to microscopic analysis to verify that sludge flocs were eliminated fig s3 pce 0 5 mm and lactate 10 mm were spiked to the ss0 2 microcosms and floc free mixed cultures to further exclude non ohrb that could biologically deplete oxygen in the dehalogenating cultures a co culture consisting of dehalococcoides mccartyi strains 11a5 harboring ptea and tcea and 11a harboring tcea and vcra lee et al 2013 low et al 2015 was established in the same mineral salt

were setup with triplicates and incubated stationarily in the dark unless stated otherwise dehalogenation activity was monitored periodically cell pellets were collected by centrifuging 1 ml samples

sequencing analyses genomic dna gdna extraction was performed using the dneasy powersoil pro kit and dneasy blood and tissue kit qiagen hilden germany for cell pellets collected from sludge microcosms and sludge free cultures respectively amplification of the v4 v5 regions of 16s rrna genes in gdna was performed using the u515f u909r primers as previously reported liang et al 2021 amplicon sequencing was performed on an illumina novaseq 6000 platform san diego ca usa in novogene ait singapore demultiplexed sequencing data was filtered and denoised followed by chimera removal and amplicon sequence variants asvs identification using dada2 callahan et al 2016 mafft was used to align the asvs katoh et al 2002 stamatakis 2014 taxonomic identification was performed by assigning the asvs against the silva138 database using the q2 feature classifier classify sklearn bokulich et al 2018 quast et al 2013 the qiime2 plugin q2 diversity was used to calculate microbial diversity 2 3 community co occurrence networks and assembly microbial co occurrence networks were separately constructed for microbial communities under each level of oxygen stress based on the reported method ju et al 2014 to improve reliability of correlation calculation only otus that were detected in at least half of the samples were included for each group yuan et al 2021b the spearman s correlation coefficient was calculated to assess the correlations among different microbial populations ju et al 2014 correlations with a coefficient 0 6 and p value 0 01 adjusted using the benjamini hochberg method to reduce false positive correlations were considered statistically significant r packages vegan v2 5 7 dixon 2003 igraph v1 2 6 csardi and nepusz 2006 and hmisc v4 5 0 harrell 2021 were used to perform all network analyses the networks were visualized with gephi v0 9 2 bastian et al 2009 both stochastic and deterministic processes contribute to community assembly ning et al 2019 to infer the proportion of each process in governing community assembly the modified stochasticity ratio mst was estimated using the nst package as previously described ning et al 2019 bray curtis metrics was used for mst estimation during null model analysis 1000 times randomization was run a cutoff value of 50 was set as the boundary value for mst stochastic processes are predicted to play more important roles in community assembly when mst is 50 whereas deterministic processes overwhelm stochastic processes when mst is 50 2 4 quantitative pcr qpcr an abi 7500 fast real time pcr system abi foster city ca usa was used to perform qpcr as reported xu et al 2022b genus and gene specific primers table s1 were used to quantify the abundance of ohrb and rdase genes behrens et al 2008 ding et al 2017 freeborn et al 2005 grostern and edwards 2006 johnson et al 2005 manchester et al 2012 wang et al 2014 xu et al 2022c zhao et al 2021 the plasmids with target amplicons were constructed using the pgem

distribution of sewage sludge flocs was measured using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer ls i3 320 beckman coulter usa as previously described wang et al 2021a pbdes and tbbpa were extracted by liquid liquid extraction as reported xu et al 2022b the extracted tbbpa was derivatized with n o bis trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetamide by incubation at 70 c for 40 min prior measurement ramaswamy et al 2021 a gas chromatography gc 6890n mass spectrometry system msd 5975 agilent equipped with a db 5ms column 15 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm agilent was sued to measure pbdes tbbpa and their dehalogenation products as described ramaswamy et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 chlorinated ethenes were detected on a gc 7890a agilent installed with a flame ionization detector and a gs gaspro column 30 m 0 32 mm 0 25 μm j w scientific folsom ca usa chen and he 2018 to obtain the dehalogenation rate constant average chlorine per chlorinated ethene cl ce and average bromine per bromobisphenol a br bbpa and brominated diphenyl ether br bde were calculated to include halogens removed from all steps of dehalogenation and fitted to the first order equation l n c t c 0 k t where c0 and ct are the average halogens per organohalide at time 0 and t respectively 2 6 data deposition raw illumina novaseq sequencing reads were deposited into ncbi with an accession number of prjna839544 3 results 3 1 efficient microbial reductive dehalogenation in sewage sludge under oxygen stress to determine the resilience of microbial reductive dehalogenation to oxygen stress in sewage sludge microcosms were established with sewage sludge 4 g l sludge ss4 and exposed to various levels of oxygen increasing oxygen stress from l0 to l5 fig s2 more than 50 pce was dechlorinated to ethene within 60 days in the ss4 microcosms under all oxygen stress levels which could be fitted to the first order equation r2 0 83 figs 1 a c and s4a only high oxygen stress showed obvious inhibition on pce dechlorination in the ss4 microcosms with the pce dechlorination rate constant slightly decreasing from 0 039 0 001 d 1 to 0 029 0 003 d 1 when oxygen stress increased from l0 to l5 respectively fig 1d nonetheless the pce dechlorination rate constant in the ss4 microcosms under the highest oxygen stress l5 was still as 74 2 as that in the control microcosm l0 the influence of oxygen stress on microbial reductive debromination of tbbpa and pbdes were also studied in the ss4 microcosms spiked with both tbbpa and pbdes tbbpa debromination could also be fitted to the first order equation r2 0 80 figs 2 a c and s5a similarly oxygen stress showed minimal inhibition on tbbpa debromination slightly decreasing the debromination rate constant from 0 164 0 005 d 1 to 0 138 0 002 d 1 when the oxygen stress increased from l0 to l5 respectively fig 2d nevertheless over 90 tbbpa was completely debrominated to bpa within 30 days in all ss4 microcosms the onset of pbde debromination was generally observed after day 30 when tbbpa debromination almost reached the highest extent fig 3 a c oxygen stress did not significantly p 0 05 suppress or stimulate pbde debromination in the ss4 microcosms with the debromination rate constant in oxygen exposed ss4 microcosms as 95 114 as that in the control fig 3d at the end of incubation pbdes were predominantly debrominated to tri and tetra bde congeners bde 17 49 and 50 by preferential removal of the para and ortho bromines with minor diphenyl ether produced 2 3 fig 3e collectively these results suggested exceptional survival of ohrb in sewage sludge to perform microbial reductive dehalogenation under oxygen stress it is also noteworthy that the same sewage sludge microbiota was capable of dehalogenating multiple structurally distinct organohalide pollutants 3 2 survival strategy of ohrb under oxygen stress to elucidate mechanisms underlying the exceptional survival of ohrb in sewage sludge to perform microbial reductive dehalogenation under oxygen stress a top down strategy was employed to simplify the pce dechlorinating sewage sludge microcosms by stepwise exclusion of sludge flocs and non ohrb these manipulated dechlorinating cultures were subjected to oxygen stress tests to discern the separate roles of sludge flocs and non ohrb in maintaining dechlorination activity under oxygen stress in the sub cultured sludge microcosms with 0 2 g l sludge flocs ss0 2 over 90 pce was dechlorinated to ethene within 60 days under all the tested oxygen stress fig 4 a surprisingly oxygen stress significantly stimulated pce dechlorination to ethene in most ss0 2 microcosms for example the pce dechlorination rate constant was increased by 53 2 at statistically significant level p 0 05 in the ss0 2 microcosm under oxygen stress l4 compared with the control fig 4d however in the enriched floc free mixed cultures where sludge flocs were eliminated elevating oxygen stress severely inhibited pce dechlorination the pce dechlorination rate constant significantly p 0 05 decreased from 0 225 0 011 to 0 044 0 003 d 1 when the oxygen stress increased from l0 to l5 fig 4b and d suggesting the crucial role of sludge flocs in protecting ohrb under oxygen stress nevertheless pce could be still detoxified to ethene in the floc free mixed cultures even under the highest oxygen stress after extended incubation fig 4b however oxygen stress completely inhibited microbial reductive dechlorination of pce in the defined co culture consisting of d mccartyi strains 11a5 and 11a fig 4c and d indicating the indispensable contribution of non ohrb in recovering dechlorination activity after oxygen exposure these observations indicate that sludge flocs and non ohrb populations play critical roles in maintaining microbial reductive dehalogenation activity in sewage sludge microbial communities under oxygen stress 3 3 differential responses of ohrb harboring distinct rdase genes to oxygen stress to elucidate the responses of ohrb and rdase genes to oxygen stress the known ohrb and rdase genes capable of dehalogenating tbbpa pbdes and pce were assayed in the dehalogenating cultures dehalococcoides and dehalogenimonas were detected as the dominant ohrb in the ss4 microcosms debrominating tbbpa and pbdes at the end of incubation fig s6 the abundance of which also increased with dehalogenation fig 5 a suggesting their involvement in debromination interestingly elevating oxygen stress preferentially selected dehalogenimonas over dehalococcoides fig 5a this was likely attributed to the higher tolerance of dehalogenimonas to oxygen exposure than dehalococcoides adrian et al 2007 yan et al 2009 the currently known tbbpa rdase gene pcba1 was detected at low abundance 3 0 102 copies ml fig s7a implicating the involvement of novel rdase s in tbbpa debromination in the ss4 microcosms contrarily the recently reported pbde rdase genes ptea tcea and bdea zhao et al 2022 zhao et al 2021 were detected at relatively higher abundance 105 copies ml in most microcosms which also showed positive correlations r 0 55 p 0 01 with pbde debromination figs s7 and s8 notably ptea tcea and bdea were co dominant in microcosms under oxygen stress l0 l3 whereas bdea was solely predominant in ss4 microcosms under the highest oxygen stress l5 fig s7a suggesting the selection of different pbde debrominating dehalococcoides strains by oxygen stress in the ss4 microcosms spiked with pce the cell abundance of dehalococcoides 3 0 106 4 0 107 cells ml was over one order of magnitude higher than that of dehalogenimonas 1 4 105 2 6 105 cells ml and dehalobacter undetectable on day 60 when pce dechlorination almost reached the highest extent fig s6b increasing oxygen stress initially suppressed growth of dehalococcoides as reflected by the slower increase and lower maximum cell abundance of dehalococcoides in the oxygen exposed ss4 microcosms than the control nonetheless the cell abundance of dehalococcoides increased and showed positive correlation with dechlorination during incubation of all ss4 microcosms spiked with pce figs 5b and s8c however it is notable that dehalococcoides was nondetectable during day 0 8 when pce was only partially dechlorinated to dces suggesting the involvement of other ohrb in pce to dces dechlorination sulfurospirillum harboring pcea gene pceasul grew in most ss4 microcosms the abundance of which was positively correlated r 0 80 p 0 01 with pce to dces dechlorination figs 5b and s8c indicating collaboration between sulfurospirillum and dehalococcoides for complete detoxification of pce to ethene similarly the growth of dehalococcoides was initially inhibited by oxygen stress in the sub cultured ss0 2 microcosms and floc free mixed cultures fig 5c d unexpectedly sulfurospirillum was phased out in the floc free mixed cultures likely caused by the favored proliferation of dehalococcoides and continued decay of sulfurospirillum due to long incubation time between subculturing 30 40 days diverse known rdase genes capable of dechlorinating chloroethenes were identified in the pce dechlorinating microcosms which showed obvious succession with oxygen stress in the pce dechlorinating ss4 microcosms pceasul and ptea collaboratively but ptea alone dechlorinated pce to tce under oxygen stress l0 l3 and l5 respectively the canonical rdases genes capable of dechlorinating dces to ethene vcra and bvca were detected at low levels whereas tcea was abundant and likely responsible for tce to ethene dechlorination fig 5b similar observations were also found in the sub cultured ss0 2 microcosms and floc free mixed cultures except that vcra emerged but pceasul was phased out in the floc free mixed cultures fig 5c d collectively these results showed that multiple ohrb harboring distinct rdase genes could survive in the sludge derived microcosms under oxygen stress for detoxification of organohalide pollutants and oxygen stress affected their growth and inter and intra species collaboration and competition 3 4 resilience of dehalogenating microbial communities to oxygen stress the microbial communities were also analyzed by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing to elucidate community level responses to oxygen stress microbial diversity quantified by shannon diversity and evenness in most dehalogenating microcosms exposed to oxygen initially showed different extents of deviation from that in the control microcosms nonetheless it gradually converged during incubation fig 6 a and b notably oxygen stress altered microbial diversity more dramatically away from the control in the sub cultured ss0 2 microcosms and floc free mixed cultures than the raw ss4 sludge microcosms suggesting the higher resistance and resilience of microbial communities in the latter the deviation of microbial diversity generally increased with elevating oxygen stress e g the maximum decrease of shannon diversity increased from 0 88 to 2 14 when the oxygen stress increased from l1 to l5 in the sub cultured ss0 2 microcosms fig 6a similarly the bray curtis dissimilarity between oxygen exposed microbial communities and the control increased at the beginning and decreased thereafter further demonstrating the resilience of dehalogenating microbial communities in response to oxygen stress fig 6c the maximum bray curtis dissimilarity values were higher in the sub cultured ss0 2 microcosms 0 60 0 67 and floc free cultures 0 58 0 72 than that in the ss4 microcosms 0 19 0 49 this indicated that the microbial communities in the ss4 microcosms were more resistant to oxygen disturbance than that in the sub cultured ss0 2 microcosms and floc free cultures more detailed analysis revealed obvious succession of microbial populations during the enrichment process with the extinction of bacteroidetes vadinha17 saprospiraceae c10 sb1a and caldilineaceae but enrichment of lentimicrobium dehalococcoides aeromonas and sphaerochaeta during subculturing fig 7 nevertheless the dominant microbial populations were similar in each type of microcosms exposed to different levels of oxygen stress the relative abundance of which also showed similar temporal trends demonstrating the resistance of dehalogenating sewage sludge microbial communities to oxygen stress to further determine whether potential microbial interactions were affected by oxygen stress microbial co occurrence network analysis was performed in the ss4 microcosms network complexity was considerably increased by oxygen stress as supported by the more nodes and edges higher average degree and graph density in the oxygen exposed ss4 microcosms compared with that in the control fig 8 a b and e similar trends were also observed in the sub cultured ss0 2 microcosms fig 8c and e however the microbial co occurrence network was obviously intensified only in the floc free mixed cultures under the highest oxygen stress compared with the control fig 8d and e community assembly analysis showed that the modified stochastic ratio mst in the ss4 microcosms 27 1 4 9 was much lower than that in the floc free mixed cultures 53 6 7 2 fig 8f this means that deterministic processes e g biological interactions played overwhelming roles in community assembly in the initial ss4 microcosms whereas stochastic processes contributed equally as deterministic processes to community assembly in the floc free mixed cultures in line with the observed higher mst values during the enrichment stage where the dominance of either ohrb fermenters and methanogens depended on the complicated stochastic processes qiu et al 2020 in general the mst values initially decreased with elevating oxygen stress but which increased when oxygen stress was higher than the threshold levels implicating level dependent effects of oxygen stress on assembly of dehalogenating microbial communities 4 discussion this study found that the same sewage sludge microbiota was capable of dehalogenating structurally distinct organohalide pollutants including pce tbbpa and pbdes correspondingly multiple known ohrb and rdase genes were detected in the sludge microcosms which collaborated to dehalogenate the tested organohalide pollutants together with extensive dehalogenation of pcbs triclosan and several fluorinated organic compounds by sewage sludge microbiota in previous reports bertin et al 2007 che et al 2021 xu et al 2021b zhang et al 2013 zhao et al 2020 it suggests that sewage sludge from municipal wastewater treatment plants might be an ideal source to obtain competent microbial cultures for detoxification of organohalide pollutants ohrb are usually sensitive to oxygen however in this study anaerobic ohrb including dehalococcoides could survive in sewage sludge derived microcosms under high oxygen stress and maintain their dehalogenation activity either with or without sludge flocs the oxygen stress posed on the dehalogenating microbial communities in this study was remarkably higher than that in previous reports amos et al 2008 liu et al 2017 the dehalogenating microbial communities were continuously aerated for up to 24 h and the headspace was filled with air in the cultures corresponding to approximately 8 mg l dissolved oxygen in this study which is much higher than the oxygen stress tested in previous studies of 20 oxygen in the headspace 7 2 mg l dissolved oxygen without continuous aeration amos et al 2008 liu et al 2017 despite such high levels of oxygen stress in our current study ohrb including dehalococcoides could survive to efficiently dehalogenate diverse organohalide pollutants for the sewage sludge microcosms initial exposure to nearly saturated concentration of dissolved oxygen i e 8 mg l inhibited dehalogenation activity by less than 30 the outstanding survival of ohrb in sewage sludge microcosms under high oxygen stress is likely attributed to physical shielding by sludge flocs and rapid depletion of oxygen by non ohrb as suggested by our comprehensive top down experiments as well as previous reports liu et al 2017 wang et al 2016 this might be a common strategy for ohrb and other anaerobic microorganisms to survive in surficial environments where oxygen disturbance occurs such as riverbed hyporheic zones and surface water atashgahi et al 2013 lu and imlay 2021 wang et al 2021b weatherill et al 2018 however it requires further investigation to determine the threshold size of sludge flocs for effective protection of ohrb during oxygen exposure and the variation of oxygen within sludge flocs the understanding of the strategy that ohrb employed to survive under oxygen stress could benefit laboratory cultivation and bioremediation application of anaerobic microbial cultures detoxifying organohalide pollutants for example certain microbial diversity could be maintained in the dehalogenating cultures to keep non ohrb populations to consume oxygen in case that oxygen disturbance occurs during cultivation and bioaugmentation meanwhile stimulating the formation of biofilm or aggregates could be adopted during production of bioinoculants for bioaugmentation payne et al 2017 2019 which may decrease direct oxygen exposure to ohrb however more in depth biomolecular insights into the resilience of microbial reductive dehalogenation to oxygen stress requires further investigation recent studies revealed that several obligate anaerobes e g geobacter bacteroides and clostridium have evolved tactics to minimize the extent to which oxygen disrupts their metabolism or restore function shortly after stress removal baughn and malamy 2004 lin et al 2004 lu and imlay 2021 a substantial number of these putative obligate anaerobes use superoxide reductases to detoxify reactive oxygen species some of which even possess o2 directed respiratory systems as an oxygen defensive or energy generating system baughn and malamy 2004 lin et al 2004 lu and imlay 2021 it warrants efforts to confirm whether the ohrb particularly dehalococcoides dwelling in the aerobic sewage sludge have evolved such features microorganisms are key players underpinning ecosystem functions such as biogeochemical cycling of carbon nitrogen and sulfur elements repeta et al 2016 shi et al 2020 tian et al 2020 wu et al 2019 therefore the ability of microbial communities to withstand environmental stress and maintain their functions is critical to ecosystem stability and prediction of ecosystem functioning in the changing environment bardgett and caruso 2020 huang et al 2020 philippot et al 2021 this study evaluates the resistance and resilience of organohalide dehalogenating microbial communities to oxygen stress despite that the diversity and structure of microbial communities were initially altered by oxygen stress they gradually converged during incubation demonstrating certain resilience of the dehalogenating communities to oxygen disturbance the microbial diversity in most microcosms encountering oxygen stress completely recovered to be the same as that in the control microcosms after different periods of incubation whereas the community structure quantified by bray curtis dissimilarity stabilized at an alternative state that was different from the control microcosms at the end of incubation this suggests the necessity to evaluate community resilience using multiple metrics notably we found that both abiotic and biotic factors likely determine the resistance and resilience of dehalogenating microbial communities to oxygen stress for example the microbial communities in sewage sludge microcosms with high concentration of sludge flocs more deterministic community assembly and high biodiversity and network complexity exhibited higher resistance and resilience to oxygen disturbance this is consistent with the profound influence of abiotic and biotic factors on the resilience of microbial communities decomposing plant residues griffiths et al 2007 in addition intensified microbial network is likely a general response of dehalogenating microbial communities to oxygen stress which may contribute to mitigating the stress collectively this study provides unprecedented mechanistic and ecological insights into the resistance and resilience of dehalogenating microbial communities to oxygen stress these findings shed lights on developing ohrb based bioremediation technologies to better remediate organohalide pollutants at sites encountering oxygen disturbance 5 conclusions sewage sludge microbiota could dehalogenate structurally distinct organohalide pollutants including pce tbbpa and pbdes organohalide respiring bacteria in sewage sludge

15546,the transport of nutrients into water bodies is one of the main causes of water eutrophication it is therefore important to estimate the loads of nutrients discharge and nutrient concentrations are the fundamental elements to estimate the loads of nutrients the latter can be affected by sampling strategies as conducting sampling campaign and laboratory analysis are both expensive it is necessary to find the best effective sampling strategy the aim of this paper is to show how autocorrelation and standard statistical methods can be used to test the effects of different sampling strategies on the nutrient load estimation and to find the optimal sampling strategy the data set in this study is from the 50 km² kielstau catchment a unesco demo site for ecohydrology in northern germany and consists of 14 years daily values of climate hydrology and water quality from 2006 to 2019 we calculated the autocorrelation ac of discharge q precipitation nitrate nitrogen no3 n and total phosphorus ptot then we tested the effects of sampling intervals from 7 to 56 days 1 8 weeks on the nutrient loads our results showed a high ac of q and no3 n for a long period but the ac of ptot and precipitation decreased very fast an increase of the sampling interval less frequent increased the error of estimating the concentrations and loads consequently we recommend that 1 the optimal sampling strategy for nutrient load estimation in an agriculture dominant catchment should be continuously monitoring discharge combined with periodic grabbed samples 2 the sampling frequency for no3 n is suggested to be monthly every 28 days and for ptot weekly every 7 days the information will help those tasked with catchment monitoring to design appropriate sampling strategy to ensure adequate data for nutrients load estimation in lowland rivers keywords load estimation autocorrelation sampling strategy nitrate nitrogen total phosphorus lowland rivers data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water quality has been one of the worldwide water related concerns for decades with increasing awareness of the water related issues the european parliament and the european council adopted the water framework directive wfd 2000 one of the main goals of the wfd is to achieve and maintain good status for all surface water bodies and groundwaters and to prevent the deterioration and thus to ensure the conservation of existing good status water bodies by 2027 kiefer et al 2015 high loads of nutrients have led to the eutrophication of surface water bodies in different countries and regions van der grift et al 2016 to estimate the load of nutrients into water bodies is critical for pollution control strategies and is necessary for the water resources management the quantitative basis of obtaining accurate and precise estimates is a sufficient and reliable data set unfortunately this basis is rather weak and still subject of many methodological discussions in water quality research the analysis of loads of nutrient is necessary to understand the behavior of nutrients in water bodies and to support water resources management van geer et al 2016 nitrogen n and phosphorus p are the most monitored or and estimated parameters to evaluate the water quality status they are generally considered to originate from non point and point sources yi et al 2020 the non point sources mainly refer to the infiltration or surface run off of agricultural fertilizer and or soil erosion into water bodies particularly in agriculture dominated areas the non point sources of nutrients are relatively difficult to quantify due to its various and dispersed sources point sources are primarily sewage effluents and or disposal from wastewater treatment plants wfd 2000 in principle continuous data sets of discharge and nutrient concentrations are needed for the load calculation the discharge measurement is the fundamental precondition to estimate nutrient load lloyd et al 2016 discharge can be easily recorded by a gauge station however the commonly used chemical parameters to measure water quality mostly require lab analysis and elaborate treatment of the samples in the field and in the lab king and harmel 2004 bende michl et al 2011 the measurement of the nutrient concentrations is relatively expensive especially for a long term monitoring therefore to achieve the best and cost effective monitoring strategy a balance between the precision of the monitoring and the sampling frequency should be decided wfd 2000 the focus of wfd is rather on the medium to large rivers whose dynamics can be smoothed whereas the best sampling frequency in small streams is not fully investigated yet traditional water quality investigation relies on periodic grab samples which take place with a low sampling frequency e g seasonally or monthly de vries and klavers 1994 jones et al 2011 however the low frequent sampling may have an inadequate temporal resolution and miss peak concentrations jones et al 2012 the guidance documents of the wfd speak of a typical sampling frequency of 2 4 weeks cis 2003 while scientific projects often need hourly frequencies chapman et al 2006 high frequency monitoring provides further understanding of hydrological chemical and biological processes van geer et al 2016 besides high frequency plus long term monitoring can help to capture seasonal characteristics and extreme events of the study area jones et al 2011 nitrate in situ sensors have been developed to provide simple and fast response data azmi et al 2017 however the sensors can be sensitive to other components in water and get contaminated which leads to a decrease of sensor s lifetime and precision alahi and mukhopadhyay 2018 some of the recent studies castrillo et al 2020 jones et al 2011 lannergård et al 2019 pellerin et al 2016 have recognized the method of estimating the nutrients loads by applying sensor technologies to get real time data 10 or 15 min frequency by measuring the proxies i e turbidity total suspended solids etc the loads then were estimated by different methods for example machine learning various linear regressions etc however there is always the dilemma either it is with reliable measures but time consuming and high labor costs or it obtains high resolution data with high costs in changing and maintaining the requirements either way it is not best solution for long term monitoring in addition these estimates are subject to uncertainties associated with use of empirical relationships in hydrological models the current in situ senser development is still young and there are many uncertainties in the techniques in addition there are also uncertainties in the mathematical equations to represent the accurate concentrations compared with standard laboratory measured concentrations these uncertainties can cause enormously under or over estimated results kong et al 2019 in small catchments intense sampling frequency is required to get a precise estimation of pollutant load richards and holloway 1987 furthermore less than 50 samples per year could produce far more bias in the estimation but they could not determine an optimal sampling frequency johnes 2007 discussed the uncertainty in load estimation and emphasized the importance of daily paired instantaneous discharge and nutrient concentration data but would allow infrequent sampling in low flow hydrological response areas intense sampling frequency decreases the estimation error but could be replaced by a longer observation time guo et al 2002 robinson et al 2004 found out that a sampling interval between 1 and 4 weeks produced similar results for the appalachian mountains for a german catchment ullrich and volk 2010 detected high deviations of nitrate loads as a function of sampling methods and intervals as well although more research is dealing with sampling frequency naddeo et al 2007 piniewski et al 2019 thompson et al 2021 wellen et al 2020 there is no given optimal sampling frequency to estimate the nutrient loads the gap of deciding the optimal sampling strategy for the estimation of nutrient loads remains unfilled in this study we hypothesized that the estimation of p and n can be affected by different sampling strategies of nutrient concentrations and river discharge the aim of this paper is to find the optimal sampling strategy for load estimation to achieve that we addressed the answers of the following research questions 1 what are the effects of different sampling intervals on both concentrations and loads of n and p 2 what is the optimal sampling strategy to estimate the load of n and p in a lowland river 2 materials and methods 2 1 kielstau catchment the kielstau basin is located in the region of schleswig holstein northern germany fig 1 it covers an area of around 51 5 km² the kielstau river is approx 17 km long the landscape is distinguished by a rather flat relief owing to the landform process under the influence of extensive glaciations the whole catchment has poor drainage due to the low gradient with a maximum altitude difference of 51 m the climate is characterized by moderate temperature and oceanic climate with soft mild moist winters and cool rainy summers average annual precipitation is around 860 mm and actual evaporation around 400 mm fohrer and schmalz 2012 soils are mainly consisting of podzol gleysol and luvisol formed in the saale and weichsel ice ages a large part of the region is wetland with a shallow groundwater level land use is mainly arable land and grassland 55 and 26 approx 38 of the agricultural area are drained with tiles fohrer et al 2007 fohrer and schmalz 2012 2 2 data preparation for this study we used a water quality data set from 2006 to 2019 fig 2 it contained data with time series of climate discharge and water quality parameters at the catchment outlet soltfeld gauge station schmalz and fohrer 2010 fohrer and schmalz 2012 wagner et al 2018 daily precipitation and air temperature data of the station meierwik was provided by the german weather service dwd 2020 discharge q data for the soltfeld gauge was available in a 15 min resolution llur 2020 and calculated as daily average for the hydrological years 1987 2018 the mean discharge was 0 45 m3 s with a range from 0 05 to 2 69 m3 s the mean daily discharge was higher during the hydrological winter november april than during the hydrological summer may october an automatic sampler maxx refrigerated sampler sp 5 s fig 1 d which was installed at the soltfeld gauge in 2006 took daily mixed water samples on site it took 10 times water from the river with 100 ml each time within 24 h and kept the samples in the sampler at a temperature of 4 the water bottles were taken back to the laboratory weekly water quality was analyzed continuously by the department of hydrology and water resources management of kiel university schmalz and fohrer 2010 fohrer and schmalz 2012 water quality analyses of n nitrate n ammonium n and p orthophosphate p total phosphorus represented as po4 p and ptot respectively were carried out using ion chromatography and photometry in the study period the nh4 n values remained much lower range between 0 to 2 mg l than no3 n in addition the nh4 n is easily to be transferred to other forms in the river and is more instable compared to no3 n so we excluded it from the n load estimation ptot was used to estimate the load of all soluble and insoluble p 2 3 statistical methods the autocorrelation ac method was used to analyze the variability of hydrological and nutrient data dondurur 2018 ac is the correlation of a data set with a shifted lagged version of itself a high ac means that the values of the following days are similar to today s value therefore it would be sufficient to take samples at a wider interval substances with low ac have to be sampled more frequently in hydrology ac can also be used as an indicator of flow paths precipitation has a low ac fluxes from the large and slowly reacting groundwater storage have a high value by this means the optimal sampling intervals can be decided according to the ac all statistical analyses were performed in the r program r core team 2022 using the built in acf function the maximum lag time was set to 100 days 2 4 sampling scenarios and load calculation the question if we could improve the results with a higher sampling resolution is beyond the scope of this paper a discussion about smaller scale effects can be found in king and harmel 2004 we considered the daily values as the benchmark values we tested different sampling strategies and calculated their nutrient loads according to our hypotheses in the introduction section there were three scenarios in this study 1 both daily discharge and concentration values were used to calculate the loads scenario b in fig 3 2 loads were calculated by daily values of discharge and periodic sampled values of nutrient concentration scenario c in fig 3 and 3 loads were calculated with both periodic sampled values of discharge and nutrient concentrations scenario d in fig 3 the data for each scenario was subsampled from the daily data set for scenario c continuous monitoring daily data of water level discharge was used but a chemical analysis was only required weekly or at any other interval in the last case neither daily was used the sampling of nutrients and discharge was both considered at certain intervals instead the intervals of the sampling were set to the ones frequently encountered in practice 7 days 14 days 30 days and 56 days i e 1 week to two months longer periods were not possible because the number of samples became too low in each year and would be insufficient to apply the analysis the loads are calculated by multiplying q and concentrations of nutrients thus the loads will show combining characteristics of both time series 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of autocorrelations autocorrelation ac analysis fig 4 shows the stability and variation of the discharge and chemical variables over time the ac of precipitation drops fast to values near 0 the sharp decline of the precipitation curve shows the random nature of precipitation on the contrary the ac of discharge remained relatively high still 0 5 after 2 weeks this is an indication that the discharge is largely controlled by a big storage with low variation typical for a catchment in a groundwater dominated lowland in an agricultural area by comparing the ac of different nutrients with hydrological components we can identify the sources of the nutrients particularly can identify the impacts of precipitation and discharge we observe that no3 n has a low short term variation ac is still 0 5 after one month the concentration of no3 n remains extremely stable over time at least up to three months the ac of no3 n has an even higher value than discharge which shows more impact from river flows than precipitation the ac of nh4 n drops sharply within first days could be because nh4 can be easily transferred to gas or other forms in water considering its small value fig 2 nh4 was excluded from n estimation in this study as in an agriculture dominant catchment groundwater is the major source of no3 n hu et al 2019 and is generally correlated with discharge fovet et al 2015 previous modeling study in this catchment proves that around 93 of the nitrate is from shallow groundwater lam et al 2012 in comparison with no3 n the ac of p shows different features on the one hand the ac of po4 p shows similar characteristic with no3 n indicates that its source is stable but on the other hand the ac of ptot drops sharply indicates that ptot has other sources besides groundwater it most probably could be the surface runoff from the surrounding crop land due to precipitation in a lowland agricultural area the input of n and p is highly impacted by runoff because of the fertilizer application ulén et al 2007 wang et al 2015 wang et al 2021 the particulate form p in the fertilizer can adsorb onto soil particles holtan et al 1988 and can be transported into rivers by surface runoff li et al 2021 that could be the reason that concentration of ptot is much higher than dissolved p po4 p compared to n it is more difficult to estimate the load of ptot to overcome this the sampling of ptot needs to be more frequent 3 2 sampling effects on nutrient concentrations and discharge after comparing different sampling strategies among daily values the benchmark and values based on 7 to 56 day 1 to 8 weeks sampling the concentration distribution of q no3 n and ptot at different sampling intervals are summarized as in the boxplots fig 5 a1 b1 c1 the true red boxplots are average values from the daily data set for the selected interval and the sampled black boxplots are the concentrations measured by the grabbed samples according to the selected interval in the scatter plots fig 5 a2 b2 c2 the y axis shows the true values the x axis shows the sampled values linear regression lines are added to show the relation between the single values the inset table presents the mean values of true and sampled values for the sampling intervals respectively our results show a similar development pattern for all the elements the range of the sampled values spread wider than the true values due to the averaging effect of the daily values fig 5 a1 b1 and c1 the relations shown in the scatter plots fig 5 a2 b2 and c2 are typical for all elements the slope of the scatter plots is always lower than 1 the higher a measured value the more probable it is collected close to a peak value event and thus the more it overestimated the concentration this is most obvious for discharge values that all the samples of 7 to 56 day are bigger than the values based on daily values inset in fig 5 a2 the effect for no3 n is visible but quite low compared to the ptot fig 5 c1 and c2 for no3 n the mean values of the 14 and 28 day intervals are lower than the true average value the sampled 7 and 14 day ptot values are almost the same with the daily average but 28 and 56 day are lower than the daily average values the scatterplot of sampled and daily values shows an overestimation of q for longer periods than no3 n and ptot the reason is higher values of q occur on fewer days for instance if the sample is taken after a heavy storm in summer the value is much higher than the average of the whole periods and therefore discharge is overestimated the results show that periodic sampling of discharge causes bigger error than the nutrient concentrations in addition the accurate periodic grabbed samples of discharge would require the working staff to measure discharge values during the rain events or shortly after them which is not always feasible in practice mccarthy et al 2018 therefore a continuous discharge is the best solution for measuring the discharge and to estimate the load 3 3 effects of sampling strategy on nutrient load estimation the effects of the sampling interval on the load calculation are similar with them on concentrations fig 6 a1 b1 two versions of load estimation have been tested and compared with daily load calculation 1 with both discharge and concentration values from periodic grabbed samples of the sampling day lperiodic fig 6 a2 and b2 scenario d from fig 3 and 2 with the daily average discharge value multiplied with the selected periodic grabbed samples lcombined fig 6 a3 and b3 scenario c from fig 3 the loads based on periodic sampling fig 6 a2 and b2 show the same characteristics as the concentrations the values of ptot show the same tendency as no3 n but the load estimation of no3 n performs better fig 6 a2 and a3 b2 and b3 respectively the deviations of the single values of ptot are more variable than no3 n but still very good compared to the sampled values notable difference in load estimation here from different sampling frequencies can be seen in the table inset fig 6 a3 and b3 lcombined shows closer values to the daily values than lperiodic the standard deviation sd was used as the measure of the reliability of the results fig 7 since it is the most important input parameter for the calculation of confidence intervals a comparison of the sd for different sampling intervals shows two very clear facts load estimation method of lcombined performs much better than lperiodic especially for no3 n for no3 n the sd between lcombined and daily values are small even with the sampling interval of 28 days for ptot the sampling intervals should be shorter approximately weekly sampling would be the best our results demonstrate that the optimal sampling strategy for the kielstau catchment is a combination of continuous gauge recording of discharge and periodic grabbed nutrient concentrations we find a notable difference in load estimations based on different sampling frequencies in a lowland river like the kielstau the discharge is stable with a high ac the higher the ac of the nutrients the smaller the error of the load estimation therefore in the rivers with a stable discharge the estimation of nutrient loads depends on the nutrient concentration the higher the sampling frequency the more accurate the load estimation johnes 2007 a wider sampling interval leads to bigger errors in estimation because single higher lower values play a more significant role moreover the sampling frequency shows less influence on the concentration of ptot than no3 n naddeo et al 2007 the longer sampling intervals generate bigger estimation errors and the error is even bigger for ptot than no3 n li et al 2019 for a good estimation with continuous discharge monitoring in a lowland river monthly sampling of no3 n is sufficient while weekly sampling for ptot is needed 3 4 limitations and implementation our study area is a lowland river in a small agricultural catchment this specifies the discharge value in a low range and narrows the sources of nutrients different dominant land uses of the catchment are reported with different proportion of nutrients from different sources li et al 2019 the optimal sampling strategy of continuous discharge monitoring and periodic nutrient concentration measurements can be used in other study areas for load estimation the sampling frequency of no3 n and ptot should work in similar catchments for other catchments our methodology of ac and standard analysis should be tested to decide the sampling frequency 4 conclusion discharge and nutrient concentrations are the fundamental elements to estimate the loads of phosphorus and nitrogen we applied standard analysis method of autocorrelation ac on different nutrient concentrations and discharge to decide the optimal sampling strategy for load estimation after testing different sampling strategies the results can be summarized as follows 1 longer sampling intervals lead to a bigger error of the load estimation shorter sampling intervals show a closer fit to both the concentration and the load calculation of the benchmark value 2 sampling strategy has a significant role in load estimation the best way for load estimation is a combination of daily discharge values and nutrient concentrations from periodic grabbed samples 3 the periodic sampling frequency depends on the ac of the variables the higher the ac is the longer the sampling interval can be for total phosphorus load estimation in a lowland river a periodic sampling of weekly is suggested but for nitrate nitrogen a monthly sampling is sufficient 4 periodic sampling of both discharge and nutrients leads to unreliable results because the standard deviation and the confidence intervals become very high the information will help those tasked with catchment monitoring to design appropriate sampling strategy to ensure adequate data for nutrients load estimation in lowland rivers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

questions 1 what are the effects of different sampling intervals on both concentrations and loads of n and p 2 what is the optimal sampling strategy to estimate the load of n and p in a lowland river 2 materials and methods 2 1 kielstau catchment the kielstau basin is located in the region of schleswig holstein northern germany fig 1 it covers an area of around 51 5 km² the kielstau river is approx 17 km long the landscape is distinguished by a rather flat relief owing to the landform process under the influence of extensive glaciations the whole catchment has poor drainage due to the low gradient with a maximum altitude difference of 51 m the climate is characterized by moderate temperature and oceanic climate with soft mild moist winters and cool rainy summers average annual precipitation is around 860 mm and actual evaporation around 400 mm fohrer and schmalz 2012 soils are mainly consisting of podzol gleysol and luvisol formed in the saale and weichsel ice ages a large part of the region is wetland with a shallow groundwater level land use is mainly arable land and grassland 55 and 26 approx 38 of the agricultural area are drained with tiles fohrer et al 2007 fohrer and schmalz 2012 2 2 data preparation for this study we used a water quality data set from 2006 to 2019 fig 2 it contained data with time series of climate discharge and water quality parameters at the catchment outlet soltfeld gauge station schmalz and fohrer 2010 fohrer and schmalz 2012 wagner et al 2018 daily precipitation and air temperature data of the station meierwik was provided by the german weather service dwd 2020 discharge q data for the soltfeld gauge was available in a 15 min resolution llur 2020 and calculated as daily average for the hydrological years 1987 2018 the mean discharge was 0 45 m3 s with a range from 0 05 to 2 69 m3 s the mean daily discharge was higher during the hydrological winter november april than during the hydrological summer may october an automatic sampler maxx refrigerated sampler sp 5 s fig 1 d which was installed at the soltfeld gauge in 2006 took daily mixed water samples on site it took 10 times water from the river with 100 ml each time within 24 h and kept the samples in the sampler at a temperature of 4 the water bottles were taken back to the laboratory weekly water quality was analyzed continuously by the department of hydrology and water resources management of kiel university schmalz and fohrer 2010 fohrer and schmalz 2012 water quality analyses of n nitrate n ammonium n and p orthophosphate p total phosphorus represented as po4 p and ptot respectively were carried out using ion chromatography and photometry in the study period the nh4 n values remained much lower range between 0 to 2 mg l than no3 n in addition the nh4 n is easily to be transferred to other forms in the river and is more instable compared to no3 n so we excluded it from the n load estimation ptot was used to estimate the load of all soluble and insoluble p 2 3 statistical methods the autocorrelation ac method was used to analyze the variability of hydrological and nutrient data dondurur 2018 ac is the correlation of a data set with a shifted lagged version of itself a high ac means that the values of the following days are similar to today s value therefore it would be sufficient to take samples at a wider interval substances with low ac have to be sampled more frequently in hydrology ac can also be used as an indicator of flow paths precipitation has a low ac fluxes from the large and slowly reacting groundwater storage have a high value by this means the optimal sampling intervals can be decided according to the ac all statistical analyses were performed in the r program r core team 2022 using the built in acf function the maximum lag time was set to 100 days 2 4 sampling scenarios and load calculation the question if we could improve the results with a higher sampling resolution is beyond the scope of this paper a discussion about smaller scale effects can be found in king and harmel 2004 we considered the daily values as the benchmark values we tested different sampling strategies and calculated their nutrient loads according to our hypotheses in the introduction section there were three scenarios in this study 1 both daily discharge and concentration values were used to calculate the loads scenario b in fig 3 2 loads were calculated by daily values of discharge and periodic sampled values of nutrient concentration scenario c in fig 3 and 3 loads were calculated with both periodic sampled values of discharge and nutrient concentrations scenario d in fig 3 the data for each scenario was subsampled from the daily data set for scenario c continuous monitoring daily data of water level discharge was used but a chemical analysis was only required weekly or at any other interval in the last case neither daily was used the sampling of nutrients and discharge was both considered at certain intervals instead the intervals of the sampling were set to the ones frequently encountered in practice 7 days 14 days 30 days and 56 days i e 1 week to two months longer periods were not possible because the number of samples became too low in each year and would be insufficient to apply the analysis the loads are calculated by multiplying q and concentrations of nutrients thus the loads will show combining characteristics of both time series 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of autocorrelations autocorrelation ac analysis fig 4 shows the stability and variation of the discharge and chemical variables over time the ac of precipitation drops fast to values near 0 the sharp decline of the precipitation curve shows the random nature of precipitation on the contrary the ac of discharge remained relatively high still 0 5 after 2 weeks this is an indication that the discharge is largely controlled by a big storage with low variation typical for a catchment in a groundwater dominated lowland in an agricultural area by comparing the ac of different nutrients with hydrological components we can identify the sources of the nutrients particularly can identify the impacts of precipitation and discharge we observe that no3 n has a low short term variation ac is still 0 5 after one month the concentration of no3 n remains extremely stable over time at least up to three months the ac of no3 n has an even higher value than discharge which shows more impact from river flows than precipitation the ac of nh4 n drops sharply within first days could be because nh4 can be easily transferred to gas or other forms in water considering its small value fig 2 nh4 was excluded from n estimation in this study as in an agriculture dominant catchment groundwater is the major source of no3 n hu et al 2019 and is generally correlated with discharge fovet et al 2015 previous modeling study in this catchment proves that around 93 of the nitrate is from shallow groundwater lam et al 2012 in comparison with no3 n the ac of p shows different features on the one hand the ac of po4 p shows similar characteristic with no3 n indicates that its source is stable but on the other hand the ac of ptot drops sharply indicates that ptot has other sources besides groundwater it most probably could be the surface runoff from the surrounding crop land due to precipitation in a lowland agricultural area the input of n and p is highly impacted by runoff because of the fertilizer application ulén et al 2007 wang et al 2015 wang et al 2021 the particulate form p in the fertilizer can adsorb onto soil particles holtan et al 1988 and can be transported into rivers by surface runoff li et al 2021 that could be the reason that concentration of ptot is much higher than dissolved p po4 p compared to n it is more difficult to estimate the load of ptot to overcome this the sampling of ptot needs to be more frequent 3 2 sampling effects on nutrient concentrations and discharge after comparing different sampling strategies among daily values the benchmark and values based on 7 to 56 day 1 to 8 weeks sampling the concentration distribution of q no3 n and ptot at different sampling intervals are summarized as in the boxplots fig 5 a1 b1 c1 the true red boxplots are average values from the daily data set for the selected interval and the sampled black boxplots are the concentrations measured by the grabbed samples according to the selected interval in the scatter plots fig 5 a2 b2 c2 the y axis shows the true values the x axis shows the sampled values linear regression lines are added to show the relation between the single values the inset table presents the mean values of true and sampled values for the sampling intervals respectively our results show a similar development pattern for all the elements the range of the sampled values spread wider than the true values due to the averaging effect of the daily values fig 5 a1 b1 and c1 the relations shown in the scatter plots fig 5 a2 b2 and c2 are typical for all elements the slope of the scatter plots is always lower than 1 the higher a measured value the more probable it is collected close to a peak value event and thus the more it overestimated the concentration this is most obvious for discharge values that all the samples of 7 to 56 day are bigger than the values based on daily values inset in fig 5 a2 the effect for no3 n is visible but quite low compared to the ptot fig 5 c1 and c2 for no3 n the mean values of the 14 and 28 day intervals are lower than the true average value the sampled 7 and 14 day ptot values are almost the same with the daily average but 28 and 56 day are lower than the daily average values the scatterplot of sampled and daily values shows an overestimation of q for longer periods than no3 n and ptot the reason is higher values of q occur on fewer days for instance if the sample is taken after a heavy storm in summer the value is much higher than the average of the whole periods and therefore discharge is overestimated the results show that periodic sampling of discharge causes bigger error than the nutrient concentrations in addition the accurate periodic grabbed samples of discharge would require the working staff to measure discharge values during the rain events or shortly after them which is not always feasible in practice mccarthy et al 2018 therefore a continuous discharge is the best solution for measuring the discharge and to estimate the load 3 3 effects of sampling strategy on nutrient load estimation the effects of the sampling interval on the load calculation are similar with them on concentrations fig 6 a1 b1 two versions of load estimation have been tested and compared with daily load calculation 1 with both discharge and concentration values from periodic grabbed samples of the sampling day lperiodic fig 6 a2 and b2 scenario d from fig 3 and 2 with the daily average discharge value multiplied with the selected periodic grabbed samples lcombined fig 6 a3 and b3 scenario c from fig 3 the loads based on periodic sampling fig 6 a2 and b2 show the same characteristics as the concentrations the values of ptot show the same tendency as no3 n but the load estimation of no3 n performs better fig 6 a2 and a3 b2 and b3 respectively the deviations of the single values of ptot are more variable than no3 n but still very good compared to the sampled values notable difference in load estimation here from different sampling frequencies can be seen in the table inset fig 6 a3 and b3 lcombined shows closer values to the daily values than lperiodic the standard deviation sd was used as the measure of the reliability of the results fig 7 since it is the most important input parameter for the calculation of confidence intervals a comparison of the sd for different sampling intervals shows two very clear facts load estimation method of lcombined performs much better than lperiodic especially for no3 n for no3 n the sd between lcombined and daily values are small even with the sampling interval of 28 days for ptot the sampling intervals should be shorter approximately weekly sampling would be the best our results demonstrate that the optimal sampling strategy for the kielstau catchment is a combination of continuous gauge recording of discharge and periodic grabbed nutrient concentrations we find a notable difference in load estimations based on different sampling frequencies in a lowland river like the kielstau the discharge is stable with a high ac the higher the ac of the nutrients the smaller the error of the load estimation therefore in the rivers with a stable discharge the estimation of nutrient loads depends on the nutrient concentration the higher the sampling frequency the more accurate the load estimation johnes 2007 a wider sampling interval leads to bigger errors in estimation because single higher lower values play a more significant role moreover the sampling frequency shows less influence on the concentration of ptot than no3 n naddeo et al 2007 the longer sampling intervals generate bigger estimation errors and the error is even bigger for ptot than no3 n li et al 2019 for a good estimation with continuous discharge monitoring in a lowland river monthly sampling of no3 n is sufficient while weekly sampling for ptot is needed 3 4 limitations and implementation our study area is a lowland river in a small agricultural catchment this specifies the discharge value in a low range and narrows the sources of nutrients different dominant land uses of the catchment are reported with different proportion of nutrients from different sources li et al 2019 the optimal sampling strategy of continuous discharge monitoring and periodic nutrient concentration measurements can be used in other study areas for load estimation the sampling frequency of no3 n and ptot should work in similar catchments for other catchments our methodology of ac and standard analysis should be tested to decide the sampling frequency 4 conclusion discharge and nutrient concentrations are the fundamental elements to estimate the loads of phosphorus and nitrogen we applied standard analysis method of autocorrelation ac on different nutrient concentrations and discharge to decide the optimal sampling strategy for load estimation after testing different sampling strategies the results can be summarized as follows 1 longer sampling intervals lead to a bigger error of the load estimation shorter sampling intervals show a closer fit to both the concentration and the load calculation of the benchmark value 2 sampling strategy has a significant role in load estimation the best way for load estimation is a combination of daily discharge values and nutrient concentrations from periodic grabbed samples 3 the periodic sampling frequency depends on the ac of the variables the higher the ac is the longer the sampling interval can be for total phosphorus load estimation in a lowland river a periodic sampling of weekly is suggested but for nitrate nitrogen a monthly sampling is sufficient 4 periodic sampling of both discharge and nutrients leads to unreliable results because the standard deviation and the confidence intervals become very high the information will help those tasked with catchment monitoring to design appropriate sampling strategy to ensure adequate data for nutrients load estimation in lowland rivers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

15547,the combined effect of pollution source discharge and sediment adsorption leads to the rapid enrichment of heavy metals and other pollutants in lake sediments which poses a serious threat to the lake ecosystem accurately identifying the risk areas of heavy metals in sediments is the key to lake sediment pollution control taking taihu lake as the study area combined with the ecological risk status of heavy metals in sediments the spatial clustering characteristics of pollution sources and the clustering information of sediment attributes a potential toxic risk area identification method based on sediment source aggregation class slisa sca was established through the source analysis of heavy metals in sediments heavy metals such as cr mn cu and zn in taihu lake sediments were identified to have originated from natural sources and were subsequently disturbed by human activities to a certain extent cd was found to be strongly affected by human activities and almost all taihu lake sediments were affected to varying degrees in addition the anthropogenic sources of heavy metals show high concentration clustering characteristics in the lake bay by k means cluster analysis of sediment attributes three significant differences were obtained which were determined as potential high pollution risk areas potential medium risk areas and potential low risk areas and the proportions were 5 6 27 6 and 66 8 respectively the slisa sca model established in this study from the perspective of source sinks comprehensively considers the risks caused by pollution sources and sediment attributes to sediments and divides taihu lake into five different risk control areas high risk control area potential high risk control area potential risk control area potential low risk control area and low risk control area this study identified areas with different levels of heavy metal pollution in taihu lake sediments proposes corresponding treatment measures and provides a scientific and systematic method and technology for the pollution management of other river and lake sediments in the world graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sediment heavy metals spatial clustering source sink risk identification data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction heavy metals are typical inorganic pollutants produced in the process of social and economic development kaur et al 2022 and have carcinogenic teratogenic mutagenic and other effects on the human body these pollutants are widely distributed in the environment and pose a serious threat to ecological security and human health esmaeili et al 2022 lake sediments are in a closed environment which will make heavy metals and other pollutants more durable when the lake environment was disturbed various pollutants in sediments will be released again posing a greater threat to the surrounding ecological environment and human health tao et al 2019 there are more than 1400 large lakes in the world which are important sources of water for human beings and their river basin was also an important area for human social and economic development lake pollution is closely related to the production and life of the people in this region the contradiction of global freshwater resources is becoming increasingly acute which is also a fatal threat to mankind xiao et al 2019 if the polluted areas in the lake can be identified and the areas with different degrees of pollution can be divided it will help to accurately control lake pollution and improve the efficiency of lake pollution control however there is a lack of systematic analysis methods for the risk analysis and risk area identification of heavy metals and other pollutants in lake sediments exploring heavy metal pollution in sediments from pollution sources is an important prerequisite for the study of lake ecological risk with the rapid development of china s industrial economy the scale and production capacity of various industries such as the coal building materials metallurgy and chemical industries are also soaring rapidly the combustion of petroleum fossil fuels and the incomplete utilization of raw materials have inevitably led to the migration of heavy metals and other pollutants into the environment long et al 2021 studies have shown that the average daily production in china was 1 01 107 tons of heavy metal containing solid waste in 2020 china statistical yearbook 2020 and the source discharge of pollutants has directly and seriously threatened ecological security therefore exploring the source and spatial distribution characteristics of heavy metals in lake sediments has important scientific guiding significance ti is relatively stable and difficult to migrate so it is often used as a reference element to correct the migration of other heavy metals wan et al 2016 the anthropogenic natural an model can eliminate the impact of heavy metal migration and accurately and quantitatively analyse the anthropogenic and natural sources of heavy metals li et al 2018 compared with other pollutant source analysis methods the isotope method needs to test the isotope data of each heavy metal which requires considerable capital and manpower source analytic receptor models such as the positive definite matrix method have rotational uncertainty and human subjectivity which will bring great errors to the analytical results kriging spatial interpolation can smooth the spatial variation in pollutants so it is often used to explore the distribution of pollutants in sediments ahn et al 2019 in fact spatial anomalies are very common in sediments as industry and population gather in some areas this may lead to point or line pollution of pollutants in nearby rivers and lakes khiari et al 2021 vega herrera et al 2022 therefore more attention must be paid to the cluster distribution pattern of the lake area lake sediments are an important sink of pollutants sediment properties such as total organic carbon toc and clay can adsorb pollutants such as heavy metals the adsorbed pollutants can be stored in sediments more permanently therefore increasing the potential risk of pollutants in sediments gonzález gaya et al 2019 berrojalbiz et al 2011 studies have shown that the higher the content of clay and organic matter in sediments is the higher the concentration of pollutants however in the current sediment risk research the impact of sediment attributes on risk assessment is often neglected and few studies include sediment attributes such as clay and organic matter content in the pollutant risk assessment system the main reason for this phenomenon is that the sediment properties cannot have a threshold similar to heavy metals and other pollutants feng et al 2017 which leads to the fact that the potential risk of sediment properties cannot be well evaluated k means clustering belongs to the classification method of unsupervised learning it combines the data of different categories into the same category with the advantages of simplification and efficiency it has been applied to the risk analysis of different pollutants morais et al 2021 schwarz et al 2022 early studies generally used the risk assessment methods of heavy metal pollution such as the enrichment index geoaccumulation index and potential ecological risk index hakanson 1980 muller 1969 cai et al 2015 to some extent these methods accurately identify whether the sample points are polluted and the degree of pollution and these methods are still used today aguilera et al 2021 with the development and update of technology geographic information technology has been widely used in the spatial prediction of pollution risk which extends the previous point pollution risk assessment to surface pollution risk assessment makes the evaluation results clearer and more specific and makes substantial progress in the risk assessment of heavy metal pollutionm wu et al 2019 as research on heavy metal pollution in sediments has formed a relatively perfect system relevant research experts have generally reached a consensus the pollution of heavy metals in sediments is jointly affected by the intensity source of anthropogenic emissions and the strong pot sink of sediment adsorption capacity however in the current research on the identification of heavy metal risk areas jia et al 2020 few studies reasonably include the emission of pollution sources and the adsorption factors of collection areas in the evaluation system which reduces the practical application value of these risk area identification methods with the rapid development of industrial economy the demand for fresh water resources has increased sharply and the contradiction of water resources has become increasingly serious as an important reservoir of fresh water the environmental quality of lakes is very important this study comprehensively considered the risk status of pollutant source sinks and takes taihu lake as the study area the main research purposes are as follows 1 to quantitatively analyse the sources of heavy metals in sedimentary materials and their spatial cluster distribution patterns 2 to explore the spatial clustering characteristics and potential risk status of sediment attributes in taihu lake and 3 to establish a comprehensive risk area identification method of heavy metals in sediments based on source sink 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and processing methods taihu lake is located in the subtropical zone with a mild and humid climate the lake covers an area of 2427 8 km2 with hills and mountains in the west and southwest and plains and water networks in the east the water system of taihu lake flows from west to east with an average annual runoff of 7 5 1010 m3 and a water storage capacity of 4 4 1010 m3 which is an important freshwater resource in the yangtze river delta region of china the average depth of taihu lake is approximately 1 8 m which makes taihu lake a shallow lake taihu lake basin is one of the largest comprehensive industrial bases in china and industrial production technology and equipment have a good foundation the industrial category structure is electronics machinery chemistry metallurgy textile and food and the industrial output value of these six industries accounts for more than 85 of the total industrial output value a stainless steel grab was used to collect sediment samples from taihu lake at an average interval of 3 km and the sample collection density was appropriately increased in the area close to the shore and in the lake bay fig 1 the first 2 cm of each sediment sample was selected and stored in a polyethylene self sealing bag and the sample number was marked on the bag the 63 surface sediment samples collected were placed in an incubator with dry ice and transported back to the laboratory freeze drying all sediment samples were freeze dried and foreign substances such as shells and plant roots were removed the sediment particle size was measured by a mastersize 2010 laser particle size metre produced by malvern company in the uk the organic matter in the sediment was determined by the potassium dichromate volumetric method and external heating method heavy metals in sediments were determined by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry icp oes and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms the specific operation steps are in the supplementary materials 2 2 quantitative source analysis for the source analysis of heavy metals in sediments taking ti as the reference element can eliminate the impact of heavy metal migration eliminate noise and more accurately and sensitively analyse the contribution of anthropogenic sources and natural sources wan et al 2016 the specific calculation formula is as follows 1 m anthropogenic m sample m natural 2 m natural ti sample m background ti background 3 r anthropogenic m anthropogenic m sample in formulas 1 and 2 m anthropogenic m natural and m sample represent the anthropogenic natural and total concentrations of metal m in sediment samples respectively ti background and ti sample represent the natural background value and total concentration of ti in sediments respectively m background indicates the concentration of metal m in the natural background material ranthropogenic is the anthropogenic source contribution rates the background values of elements in taihu lake sediments are selected from ref li et al 2018 2 3 local indicators of spatial association the global moran index method was proposed by patrick an australian statistician in 1950 it is an important statistical index used to study the spatial autocorrelation of a region the so called spatial autocorrelation similar to time series autocorrelation refers to the overall spatial correlation of the spatial attributes of a spatial variable at different locations in the study area and the spatial attributes of its surrounding adjacent locations because of its harsh and complex requirements anselin proposed local indicators of spatial association lisa in 1995 the methodology holds that for the subregions centred on any spatial elements in the study area the autocorrelation statistical index can be calculated to express the spatial correlation in different subregions to better analyse its distribution law anselin 1995 the specific calculation formula of lisa is as follows 4 c j x j x i 1 i j n w i j x i x i 1 i j n x i x 2 n 1 in formula 4 c j is the local moran index corresponding to the j th sample wi j represents the spatial weight value between sample i and sample j and n is the total number of samples of variable x lisa analysis was completed by geoda software http geodacentre github io 2 4 k means clustering the basic principle of the traditional k means clustering algorithm is that first the user selects k scenes as the initial clustering centre in advance where k is the number of typical scenes expected at the end of clustering vasilaki et al 2018 then the euclidean distance from each remaining sample scene to the initial cluster centre was calculated and the remaining sample scenes were classified into their adjacent initial cluster centres to form a cluster according to the proximity principle finally the average euclidean distance of scenes in k clusters was calculated and the value of the average euclidean distance of each cluster was taken as the new cluster centre therefore the process of scene compression was completed by using the traditional k means clustering algorithm until the new cluster centre and the old cluster centre were no longer changed and the cluster centre was output the flow chart of scene compression is shown in fig s1 by calculating the distance between each sample and each cluster centre the k means algorithm marks the samples according to the principle of nearest distance peng et al 2018 gautam et al 2022 5 d i j k 1 p x i k x j k 2 where each micro trip has p parameters x i k and x j k are the k characteristics of samples i and j and d i j is the distance of each micro trip if the same sample data are clustered repeatedly the appropriate k value should produce the same or similar clustering results i e stability was regarded as an indicator of whether the k value is appropriate according to the clustering stability test results it was finally determined that all driving units were grouped into three categories k means clustering analysis was carried out in spss 26 0 statistical graphics crop princeton usa 2 5 establishment of the slisa sca model the slisa sca model was mainly composed of two parts fig 2 first the source of heavy metals in sediments was used to quantitatively analyse the contribution of human activities in each region of taihu lake cluster analyse its spatial distribution and evaluate the ecological risk of heavy metals the second was the attribute of the heavy metal sink area which was classified by k means clustering and its potential risk status was explored finally based on the source sink risk analysis of heavy metals in sediments a conceptual model was established to partition the risk of heavy metal pollution in taihu lake 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of heavy metals the spatial distributions of the concentrations of heavy metals such as pb cr zn cu and mn in sediments are similar fig 3 a the concentration was relatively high in the lake bay area which was basically concentrated in zhushan bay meiliang bay and gonghu bay in the centre and southeast of taihu lake the concentration of heavy metals was relatively low the concentration of the heavy metal cd was the highest near the west bank of taihu lake higher in zhushan bay and gonghu bay and lower in the centre and southeast of taihu lake the area close to the shore and the lake bay area were most affected by human activities and the corresponding pollutant concentration will be higher the flow direction of taihu lake from west to east and the special handicraft industry of coastal cities affect the spatial distribution of heavy metals to a great extent combined with the ecological risk analysis of heavy metals fig 4 it was found that the areas with pollution risk of heavy metals in taihu lake sediments were also basically distributed in lake bay areas especially zhushan bay the pollution risk areas of different heavy metals vary greatly the areas with pollution risks of the heavy metals cr mn ni cu zn cd and pb accounted for 34 9 7 9 6 3 15 9 4 8 96 8 and 66 7 respectively among them cd pollution in the sediments of taihu lake was the most serious which basically covers the whole taihu lake this situation required management to pay enough attention and take relevant pollution control measures immediately investigations and studies have shown that yixing city on the west bank of taihu lake with the reputation of ceramic capital produces a large number of ceramic products year round and sells them at home and abroad however raw materials for ceramic production such as gehuang and cadmium red contained a large amount of cd in the process of ceramic production they inevitably enter the lake environment through atmospheric dust wastewater infiltration and waste transportation which poses a great threat to the ecological security of taihu lake studies have shown that the ceramic industry in yixing has caused serious cd pollution to the surrounding soil sediment and lake water liao et al 2015 compared with the concentrations of heavy metals in the sediments of other lakes at home and abroad table 1 cr mn and cu in the sediments of taihu lake were at a medium level while the heavy metals pb and cd are at a high level the environmental management department should pay attention to this situation and clarifying the sources of pb and cd in the sediments of taihu lake has become the primary task of pollution control 3 2 sources and spatial clustering characteristics of heavy metals the sources of heavy metals can also be divided into natural sources and anthropogenic sources natural heavy metals of taihu mainly come from soil erosion nineral weathering and biogeochemical cycles li et al 2018 anthropogenic sources of taihu mainly come from industrial agricultural production and life processes liu et al 2021 niu et al 2020 different heavy metals may have the same or similar pollution sources or may come from different pollution sources to explore the source characteristics of heavy metals in taihu lake sediments the correlation and significance between different heavy metals were analysed table s3 the heavy metals cr mn ni cu zn cd and pb in taihu lake sediments are significantly correlated at the level of 0 01 and the correlation between the heavy metals cr mn ni cu and zn is more than 0 8 r2 value is 0 64 this indicated that there were similar pollution sources of heavy metals in the sediments of taihu lake and some heavy metals may have the same pollution sources in contrast the correlation between the heavy metal cd and other elements in taihu lake sediments was relatively weak maintained at approximately 0 5 r2 value was approximately 0 25 which indicated that in addition to the similar pollution sources between cd and other elements there were also their own unique pollution sources these special pollution sources were different from other elements and the heavy metal pb also had similar characteristics to cd in pollution sources to further determine the types of pollution sources and their contribution of heavy metals in sediments we analysed the sources of heavy metals in sediments of taihu lake table s4 according to the analysis of the heavy metal source analysis model the sources of heavy metals were divided into natural sources and anthropogenic sources basically the natural source variation range of each heavy metal was narrow and relatively stable and the value was small which was in line with the content characteristics of natural source elements indicating that the source analysis results have high reliability compared with the natural source concentration of heavy metals in the sediment of taihu lake the anthropogenic source concentration of heavy metals varies widely which was several to dozens of times that of its natural source the coefficient of variation of the heavy metals cr mn ni and cu exceeded 100 indicating that they have been strongly disturbed by the external environment the anthropogenic source contribution rates of cr mn ni cu zn and pb in sediments were 34 2 11 7 11 9 24 5 12 0 and 34 1 respectively which indicated that the environment of taihu lake has been seriously disturbed by human beings most of the heavy metal sources in the sediments of taihu lake contribute 74 4 of the cd fig 5 c this phenomenon needs to be given enough attention heavy metals in taihu lake have been obviously and strongly disturbed by human beings taihu lake basin is the largest comprehensive industrial base in china and its electronics machinery chemistry metallurgy textile and other industries account for more than three quarters of its total industrial output value as we all know electronics metallurgy chemistry and other industries are important sources of heavy metal pollution avellaneda et al 2022 in the process of production and processing it is inevitable to discharge waste rich in heavy metals into the surrounding environment 3 3 cluster analysis of sink sediment attributes the properties of sediments in the collection area can significantly affect the enrichment of pollutants to a certain extent the sediment attribute data of taihu lake were tested and described table s2 the average concentration of sediment toc was 17 7 mg kg 1 with a variation range of 11 8 32 6 mg kg 1 the average proportion of clay particles was 11 3 and the variation range was 7 19 the average proportion of silt was 79 2 and the variation range was 73 86 the average proportion of sand is 9 5 and the variation range is 3 17 the high content of toc in sediments was mainly distributed in zhushan bay meiliang bay gonghu bay and east taihu lake fig s2a and the toc content is relatively low in the southern western and central areas of taiyuan the clay content showed similar spatial distribution characteristics to toc the content of sand and gravel was mainly concentrated in the middle and high sand and gravel areas in western taihu lake and southern taihu lake five years ago the total organic carbon content in taihu lake sediments was 6 86 mg g 1 and the clay content was 11 0 in contrast the content of clay particles in taihu lake sediments has not changed while the content of total organic matter has increased significantly which indicates that the accumulation of organic matter in taihu lake sediments has been significantly affected in recent years the correlation between different properties of sediments and various heavy metals is obvious table s3 there was a significant positive correlation between toc and clay content and various heavy metals while there was no significant correlation between gravel and silt content and various heavy metals by taking the concentration indices of heavy metals in sediments as species factors and sediment particle size toc and other indices as environmental factors redundancy analysis was carried out the analysis results are shown in fig 5a and 5b the contents of toc and clay particles in sediments of taihu lake have significant effects on all heavy metals and their influence degrees reach 28 6 and 69 2 respectively which largely determines the enrichment capacity of heavy metals in sediments the content of sediment silt and sand has a weak effect on the enrichment of heavy metals the characteristics of sediment toc and particle size affect or determine the enrichment capacity of heavy metals and other pollutants to a great extent and pose a potential threat to the ecological security of lakes to clarify the combined characteristics of different attribute indices of sediments in taihu lake and classify the combined characteristics of different attributes this study carried out cluster analysis k means clustering on different attribute indices of sediments in the k means clustering algorithm the number of categories k had an important impact on the accuracy of the clustering results but usually the accurate value of k was unknown at first if k was greater than the true value the same class of data will be wrongly divided into multiple classes which will lead to the fuzzy boundary of the clustering results in contrast merging different categories of data into the same category will reduce the compactness of the cluster therefore clustering stability was usually used to determine the k value luxburg et al 2010 bendavid et al 2007 the basic idea of this method was that if the same sample data wre clustered repeatedly the appropriate k value should produce the same or similar clustering results i e stability was regarded as the index of whether the k value is appropriate according to the clustering stability test results it was finally determined to cluster all driving units into three categories tables s6 s7 because there was no change or only a small change in the cluster centre convergence was realized the maximum absolute coordinate change of any centre was 0 the current iteration was 7 and the minimum distance between the initial centres was 8 506 according to the cluster analysis there were significant differences among the three types of sediments table s7 the contents of toc clay silt and sand of the first type of sediment were 23 9 g kg 1 14 2 78 0 and 8 7 respectively the contents of toc clay silt and sand of the second type of sediment attribute were 19 5 g kg 1 11 8 80 7 and 8 7 respectively the contents of toc clay silt and sand of the third type of sediment attribute were 15 2 g kg 1 10 3 78 8 and 9 3 respectively in summary there were obvious differences in the attribute characteristics of the three types of sediments the first type of sediment had the highest content of organic matter and clay had a strong adsorption capacity for heavy metals and other pollutants and was basically distributed in the lake bay area fig s2b this area is strongly disturbed by human activities therefore the area of the first type of sediment was determined to be a potential high pollution risk area the content of organic matter and clay particles in the second type of sediment was relatively high and the adsorption capacity of heavy metals and other pollutants was relatively strong which was roughly distributed in the lake bay and the area near the shore this area also receives relatively strong interference from human activities therefore the area of the second type of sediment was determined to be a potential medium risk area the third type of sediment had the lowest content of organic matter and clay the adsorption capacity of heavy metals and other pollutants was very small and the content of gravel was the highest it was mainly distributed in southern taiyuan and the central area and the interference from human activities was weak therefore the area of the third type of sediment was determined as a potential low risk area the proportions of potential high risk areas medium risk areas and low risk areas of heavy metals in sediments of taihu lake are 5 6 27 6 and 66 8 respectively 3 4 identification of potential risk areas combined with the sources of heavy metals in sediments and the attribute characteristics of sediments in the collection area we established a new method to comprehensively evaluate the pollution risk status of heavy metals in sediments from the following three aspects the ecological risk of heavy metals in sediments the spatial clustering characteristics of anthropogenic sources of heavy metals and the attribute clustering characteristics of sediments in the collection area if the geoaccumulation index igeo details are in the supplementary materials was greater than 0 it indicated that there was an ecological risk of heavy metals in sediments if the geoaccumulation index was less than 0 it indicated that there was no ecological risk of heavy metals in sediments there were three spatial clustering characteristics of anthropogenic heavy metal concentrations high high low low and not significant high high means that each point in the area is surrounded by high concentration points of heavy metals indicating that the area has high pollution risk low low means that each point in the area is surrounded by low concentration points of heavy metals indicating that the area has no pollution risk or low pollution risk the nonsignificant area runs through the points of high concentration and low concentration showing an irregular state there may or may not be heavy metal pollution risk in this area to some extent the attribute characteristics of sediments in the collection area determine the enrichment capacity of pollutants and become a potential risk index according to cluster analysis the sediment attributes of taihu lake were divided into three cluster combinations potential high risk areas potential risk areas and potential low risk areas according to the established comprehensive risk assessment method the study divides the risk status of taihu lake into five types high risk control area potential high risk control area potential risk control area potential low risk control area and low risk control area for example if an area exceeds the ecological risk threshold of heavy metals the spatial clustering characteristics of anthropogenic sources of heavy metals show a high high area or the clustering of sediment attributes shows potential risks this area is the health risk control zone of heavy metal pollution the classification of different levels of potential risk control areas is mainly based on the clustering characteristics of sediment attributes and the special circumstances of the other two factors are also considered the specific classification information and standards are shown in table s8 combined with the established new comprehensive risk assessment method for sediments this study divided the risk status of various heavy metals in taihu lake sediments fig 6 the high risk control areas of heavy metal pb in sediments are mainly distributed in zhushan bay meiliang bay and gonghu bay and the potential high risk control areas were mainly distributed in xukou bay and east taihu lake accounting for 7 4 and 2 6 respectively potential risk control areas and potential low risk control areas were mainly distributed in the lake bay and near the lake shore and low risk control areas were mainly distributed in the centre of the lake accounting for 35 9 25 6 and 28 5 respectively the comprehensive risk zoning of sediment heavy metals cr mn ni cu and zn showed similar characteristics to pb fig s3 the high risk control area of heavy metal cd in sediments was mainly distributed in west taihu lake and zhushan bay the potential risk control area covers almost the whole taihu lake and the distribution area of the potential high risk control area and low risk control area was very small accounting for 14 7 80 6 3 2 and 1 5 respectively based on this pollution zoning the environmental management department can take different governance measures according to different pollution conditions of heavy metals in sediments for example for high risk and potentially high risk control areas measures such as regular dredging and algae removal can be taken to cut off the enrichment of heavy metals for potential risk areas we can strengthen the restriction intensity of lake operation activities in this area and observe sediment and water quality in real time environmental managers should recommend the generalization of domestic and industrial wastewater treatment and the implementation of equipment such as constructed wetlands aimed at depurating rainwaters flowing on streets roads and pavements in addition regarding all measures to be taken in all areas of lake taihu environmental managers should recommend the generalization of domestic and industrial wastewater treatment and the implementation of equipment such as constructed wetlands aimed at depurating rainwaters flowing on streets roads and pavements this method has been well applied in this study and addressed gaps for the study of classification methods for indicators lacking classification thresholds such as sediment attributes the newly established slisa sca model combined the risk clustering characteristics of the sediment heavy metal source sink and its own pollution risk level to make a reasonable risk zoning for the study area and the model reduced the uncertainty of risk identification and zoning caused by only using spatial interpolation compared with other technologies the slisa sca model has stronger reliability and a wider scope of application for risk identification and management table 2 however there were still some problems in this model that need to be further improved 1 the bioavailability of different forms of heavy metals in sediments varies greatly if conditions permit it is best to test the content of free and residual heavy metals in sediments to better evaluate the ecological risk of heavy metals in sediments 2 black carbon components such as char and soot have strong adsorption these indicators can also be considered when classifying sediment attributes 4 conclusions lake sediments are in a closed environment in which heavy metals and other pollutants are rapidly enriched when the lake environment is disturbed various pollutants in the sediment will be released again posing a greater threat to the surrounding human health and ecological environment the study of the risk of heavy metal pollution in the lake system is complex and the heavy metals in the area with a great impact of human activities show a strong enrichment at this point which will strengthen the spatial heterogeneity of heavy metals lisa can overcome this defect and is a good method to identify specific pollutant hotspots in addition the toc and clay properties of sediments have a strong ability to adsorb heavy metals and other pollutants which can greatly increase the potential ecological risk of heavy metals in sediments this study used a model to analyse the anthropogenic and natural sources of heavy metals in taihu lake sediments and found that human activities significantly accelerated the enrichment of heavy metals in sediments using lisa and k means clustering analysis the spatial clustering characteristics of heavy metal elements and attribute characteristics in sediments are analysed and different potential risk types caused by sediment attributes were identified based on this the slisa sca model established in this study from the perspective of source sinks comprehensively considers the risks caused by pollution sources and sediment attributes to sediments and divides taihu lake into a high risk control area potential high risk control area potential medium risk control area potential risk control area potential low risk control area and low risk control area the slisa sca model reduced the uncertainty of risk identification and zoning and provides a more intuitive and objective spatial view of heavy metal risk management and control compared with other technologies this model had stronger reliability and a wider scope of application

15547,the combined effect of pollution source discharge and sediment adsorption leads to the rapid enrichment of heavy metals and other pollutants in lake sediments which poses a serious threat to the lake ecosystem accurately identifying the risk areas of heavy metals in sediments is the key to lake sediment pollution control taking taihu lake as the study area combined with the ecological risk status of heavy metals in sediments the spatial clustering characteristics of pollution sources and the clustering information of sediment attributes a potential toxic risk area identification method based on sediment source aggregation class slisa sca was established through the source analysis of heavy metals in sediments heavy metals such as cr mn cu and zn in taihu lake sediments were identified to have originated from natural sources and were subsequently disturbed by human activities to a certain extent cd was found to be strongly affected by human activities and almost all taihu lake sediments were affected to varying degrees in addition the anthropogenic sources of heavy metals show high concentration clustering characteristics in the lake bay by k means cluster analysis of sediment attributes three significant differences were obtained which were determined as potential high pollution risk areas potential medium risk areas and potential low risk areas and the proportions were 5 6 27 6 and 66 8 respectively the slisa sca model established in this study from the perspective of source sinks comprehensively considers the risks caused by pollution sources and sediment attributes to sediments and divides taihu lake into five different risk control areas high risk control area potential high risk control area potential risk control area potential low risk control area and low risk control area this study identified areas with different levels of heavy metal pollution in taihu lake sediments proposes corresponding treatment measures and provides a scientific and systematic method and technology for the pollution management of other river and lake sediments in the world graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sediment heavy metals spatial clustering source sink risk identification data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction heavy metals are typical inorganic pollutants produced in the process of social and economic development kaur et al 2022 and have carcinogenic teratogenic mutagenic and other effects on the human body these pollutants are widely distributed in the environment and pose a serious threat to ecological security and human health esmaeili et al 2022 lake sediments are in a closed environment which will make heavy metals and other pollutants more durable when the lake environment was disturbed various pollutants in sediments will be released again posing a greater threat to the surrounding ecological environment and human health tao et al 2019 there are more than 1400 large lakes in the world which are important sources of water for human beings and their river basin was also an important area for human social and economic development lake pollution is closely related to the production and life of the people in this region the contradiction of global freshwater resources is becoming increasingly acute which is also a fatal threat to mankind xiao et al 2019 if the polluted areas in the lake can be identified and the areas with different degrees of pollution can be divided it will help to accurately control lake pollution and improve the efficiency of lake pollution control however there is a lack of systematic analysis methods for the risk analysis and risk area identification of heavy metals and other pollutants in lake sediments exploring heavy metal pollution in sediments from pollution sources is an important prerequisite for the study of lake ecological risk with the rapid development of china s industrial economy the scale and production capacity of various industries such as the coal building materials metallurgy and chemical industries are also soaring rapidly the combustion of petroleum fossil fuels and the incomplete utilization of raw materials have inevitably led to the migration of heavy metals and other pollutants into the environment long et al 2021 studies have shown that the average daily production in china was 1 01 107 tons of heavy metal containing solid waste in 2020 china statistical yearbook 2020 and the source discharge of pollutants has directly and seriously threatened ecological security therefore exploring the source and spatial distribution characteristics of heavy metals in lake sediments has important scientific guiding significance ti is relatively stable and difficult to migrate so it is often used as a reference element to correct the migration of other heavy metals wan et al 2016 the anthropogenic natural an model can eliminate the impact of heavy metal migration and accurately and quantitatively analyse the anthropogenic and natural sources of heavy metals li et al 2018 compared with other pollutant source analysis methods the isotope method needs to test the isotope data of each heavy metal which requires considerable capital and manpower source analytic receptor models such as the positive definite matrix method have rotational uncertainty and human subjectivity which will bring great errors to the analytical results kriging spatial interpolation can smooth the spatial variation in pollutants so it is often used to explore the distribution of pollutants in sediments ahn et al 2019 in fact spatial anomalies are very common in sediments as industry and population gather in some areas this may lead to point or line pollution of pollutants in nearby rivers and lakes khiari et al 2021 vega herrera et al 2022 therefore more attention must be paid to the cluster distribution pattern of the lake area lake sediments are an important sink of pollutants sediment properties such as total organic carbon toc and clay can adsorb pollutants such as heavy metals the adsorbed pollutants can be stored in sediments more permanently therefore increasing the potential risk of pollutants in sediments gonzález gaya et al 2019 berrojalbiz et al 2011 studies have shown that the higher the content of clay and organic matter in sediments is the higher the concentration of pollutants however in the current sediment risk research the impact of sediment attributes on risk assessment is often neglected and few studies include sediment attributes such as clay and organic matter content in the pollutant risk assessment system the main reason for this phenomenon is that the sediment properties cannot have a threshold similar to heavy metals and other pollutants feng et al 2017 which leads to the fact that the potential risk of sediment properties cannot be well evaluated k means clustering belongs to the classification method of unsupervised learning it combines the data of different categories into the same category with the advantages of simplification and efficiency it has been applied to the risk analysis of different pollutants morais et al 2021 schwarz et al 2022 early studies generally used the risk assessment methods of heavy metal pollution such as the enrichment index geoaccumulation index and potential ecological risk index hakanson 1980 muller 1969 cai et al 2015 to some extent these methods accurately identify whether the sample points are polluted and the degree of pollution and these methods are still used today aguilera et al 2021 with the development and update of technology geographic information technology has been widely used in the spatial prediction of pollution risk which extends the previous point pollution risk assessment to surface pollution risk assessment makes the evaluation results clearer and more specific and makes substantial progress in the risk assessment of heavy metal pollutionm wu et al 2019 as research on heavy metal pollution in sediments has formed a relatively perfect system relevant research experts have generally reached a consensus the pollution of heavy metals in sediments is jointly affected by the intensity source of anthropogenic emissions and the strong pot sink of sediment adsorption capacity however in the current research on the identification of heavy metal risk areas jia et al 2020 few studies reasonably include the emission of pollution sources and the adsorption factors of collection areas in the evaluation system which reduces the practical application value of these risk area identification methods with the rapid development of industrial economy the demand for fresh water resources has increased sharply and the contradiction of water resources has become increasingly serious as an important reservoir of fresh water the environmental quality of lakes is very important this study comprehensively considered the risk status of pollutant source sinks and takes taihu lake as the study area the main research purposes are as follows 1 to quantitatively analyse the sources of heavy metals in sedimentary materials and their spatial cluster distribution patterns 2 to explore the spatial clustering characteristics and potential risk status of sediment attributes in taihu lake and 3 to establish a comprehensive risk area identification method of heavy metals in sediments based on source sink 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and processing methods taihu lake is located in the subtropical zone with a mild and humid climate the lake covers an area of 2427 8 km2 with hills and mountains in the west and southwest and plains and water networks in the east the water system of taihu lake flows from west to east with an average annual runoff of 7 5 1010 m3 and a water storage capacity of 4 4 1010 m3 which is an important freshwater resource in the yangtze river delta region of china the average depth of taihu lake is approximately 1 8 m which makes taihu lake a shallow lake taihu lake basin is one of the largest comprehensive industrial bases in china and industrial production technology and equipment have a good foundation the industrial category structure is electronics machinery chemistry metallurgy textile and food and the industrial output value of these six industries accounts for more than 85 of the total industrial output value a stainless steel grab was used to collect sediment samples from taihu lake at an average interval of 3 km and the sample collection density was appropriately increased in the area close to the shore and in the lake bay fig 1 the first 2 cm of each sediment sample was selected and stored in a polyethylene self sealing bag and the sample number was marked on the bag the 63 surface sediment samples collected were placed in an incubator with dry ice and transported back to the laboratory freeze drying all sediment samples were freeze dried and foreign substances such as shells and plant roots were removed the sediment particle size was measured by a mastersize 2010 laser particle size metre produced by malvern company in the uk the organic matter in the sediment was determined by the potassium dichromate volumetric method and external heating method heavy metals in sediments were determined by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry icp oes and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms the specific operation steps are in the supplementary materials 2 2 quantitative source analysis for the source analysis of heavy metals in sediments taking ti as the reference element can eliminate the impact of heavy metal migration eliminate noise and more accurately and sensitively analyse the contribution of anthropogenic sources and natural sources wan et al 2016 the specific calculation formula is as follows 1 m anthropogenic m sample m natural 2 m natural ti sample m background ti background 3 r anthropogenic m anthropogenic m sample in formulas 1 and 2 m anthropogenic m natural and m sample represent the anthropogenic natural and total concentrations of metal m in sediment samples respectively ti background and ti sample represent the natural background value and total concentration of ti in sediments respectively m background indicates the concentration of metal m in the natural background material ranthropogenic is the anthropogenic source contribution rates the background values of elements in taihu lake sediments are selected from ref li et al 2018 2 3 local indicators of spatial association the global moran index method was proposed by patrick an australian statistician in 1950 it is an important statistical index used to study the spatial autocorrelation of a region the so called spatial autocorrelation similar to time series autocorrelation refers to the overall spatial correlation of the spatial attributes of a spatial variable at different locations in the study area and the spatial attributes of its surrounding adjacent locations because of its harsh and complex requirements anselin proposed local indicators of spatial association lisa in 1995 the methodology holds that for the subregions centred on any spatial elements in the study area the autocorrelation statistical index can be calculated to express the spatial correlation in different subregions to better analyse its distribution law anselin 1995 the specific calculation formula of lisa is as follows 4 c j x j x i 1 i j n w i j x i x i 1 i j n x i x 2 n 1 in formula 4 c j is the local moran index corresponding to the j th sample wi j represents the spatial weight value between sample i and sample j and n is the total number of samples of variable x lisa analysis was completed by geoda software http geodacentre github io 2 4 k means clustering the basic principle of the traditional k means clustering algorithm is that first the user selects k scenes as the initial clustering centre in advance where k is the number of typical scenes expected at the end of clustering vasilaki et al 2018 then the euclidean distance from each remaining sample scene to the initial cluster centre was calculated and the remaining sample scenes were classified into their adjacent initial cluster centres to form a cluster according to the proximity principle finally the average euclidean distance of scenes in k clusters was calculated and the value of the average euclidean distance of each cluster was taken as the new cluster centre therefore the process of scene compression was completed by using the traditional k means clustering algorithm until the new cluster centre and the old cluster centre were no longer changed and the cluster centre was output the flow chart of scene compression is shown in fig s1 by calculating the distance between each sample and each cluster centre the k means algorithm marks the samples according to the principle of nearest distance peng et al 2018 gautam et al 2022 5 d i j k 1 p x i k x j k 2 where each micro trip has p parameters x i k and x j k are the k characteristics of samples i and j and d i j is the distance of each micro trip if the same sample data are clustered repeatedly the appropriate k value should produce the same or similar clustering results i e stability was regarded as an indicator of whether the k value is appropriate according to the clustering stability test results it was finally determined that all driving units were grouped into three categories k means clustering analysis was carried out in spss 26 0 statistical graphics crop princeton usa 2 5 establishment of the slisa sca model the slisa sca model was mainly composed of two parts fig 2 first the source of heavy metals in sediments was used to quantitatively analyse the contribution of human activities in each region of taihu lake cluster analyse its spatial distribution and evaluate the ecological risk of heavy metals the second was the attribute of the heavy metal sink area which was classified by k means clustering and its potential risk status was explored finally based on the source sink risk analysis of heavy metals in sediments a conceptual model was established to partition the risk of heavy metal pollution in taihu lake 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of heavy metals the spatial distributions of the concentrations of heavy metals such as pb cr zn cu and mn in sediments are similar fig 3 a the concentration was relatively high in the lake bay area which was basically concentrated in zhushan bay meiliang bay and gonghu bay in the centre and southeast of taihu lake the concentration of heavy metals was relatively low the concentration of the heavy metal cd was the highest near the west bank of taihu lake higher in zhushan bay and gonghu bay and lower in the centre and southeast of taihu lake the area close to the shore and the lake bay area were most affected by human activities and the corresponding pollutant concentration will be higher the flow direction of taihu lake from west to east and the special handicraft industry of coastal cities affect the spatial distribution of heavy metals to a great extent combined with the ecological risk analysis of heavy metals fig 4 it was found that the areas with pollution risk of heavy metals in taihu lake sediments were also basically distributed in lake bay areas especially zhushan bay the pollution risk areas of different heavy metals vary greatly the areas with pollution risks of the heavy metals cr mn ni cu zn cd and pb accounted for 34 9 7 9 6 3 15 9 4 8 96 8 and 66 7 respectively among them cd pollution in the sediments of taihu lake was the most serious which basically covers the whole taihu lake this situation required management to pay enough attention and take relevant pollution control measures immediately investigations and studies have shown that yixing city on the west bank of taihu lake with the reputation of ceramic capital produces a large number of ceramic products year round and sells them at home and abroad however raw materials for ceramic production such as gehuang and cadmium red contained a large amount of cd in the process of ceramic production they inevitably enter the lake environment through atmospheric dust wastewater infiltration and waste transportation which poses a great threat to the ecological security of taihu lake studies have shown that the ceramic industry in yixing has caused serious cd pollution to the surrounding soil sediment and lake water liao et al 2015 compared with the concentrations of heavy metals in the sediments of other lakes at home and abroad table 1 cr mn and cu in the sediments of taihu lake were at a medium level while the heavy metals pb and cd are at a high level the environmental management department should pay attention to this situation and clarifying the sources of pb and cd in the sediments of taihu lake has become the primary task of pollution control 3 2 sources and spatial clustering characteristics of heavy metals the sources of heavy metals can also be divided into natural sources and anthropogenic sources natural heavy metals of taihu mainly come from soil erosion nineral weathering and biogeochemical cycles li et al 2018 anthropogenic sources of taihu mainly come from industrial agricultural production and life processes liu et al 2021 niu et al 2020 different heavy metals may have the same or similar pollution sources or may come from different pollution sources to explore the source characteristics of heavy metals in taihu lake sediments the correlation and significance between different heavy metals were analysed table s3 the heavy metals cr mn ni cu zn cd and pb in taihu lake sediments are significantly correlated at the level of 0 01 and the correlation between the heavy metals cr mn ni cu and zn is more than 0 8 r2 value is 0 64 this indicated that there were similar pollution sources of heavy metals in the sediments of taihu lake and some heavy metals may have the same pollution sources in contrast the correlation between the heavy metal cd and other elements in taihu lake sediments was relatively weak maintained at approximately 0 5 r2 value was approximately 0 25 which indicated that in addition to the similar pollution sources between cd and other elements there were also their own unique pollution sources these special pollution sources were different from other elements and the heavy metal pb also had similar characteristics to cd in pollution sources to further determine the types of pollution sources and their contribution of heavy metals in sediments we analysed the sources of heavy metals in sediments of taihu lake table s4 according to the analysis of the heavy metal source analysis model the sources of heavy metals were divided into natural sources and anthropogenic sources basically the natural source variation range of each heavy metal was narrow and relatively stable and the value was small which was in line with the content characteristics of natural source elements indicating that the source analysis results have high reliability compared with the natural source concentration of heavy metals in the sediment of taihu lake the anthropogenic source concentration of heavy metals varies widely which was several to dozens of times that of its natural source the coefficient of variation of the heavy metals cr mn ni and cu exceeded 100 indicating that they have been strongly disturbed by the external environment the anthropogenic source contribution rates of cr mn ni cu zn and pb in sediments were 34 2 11 7 11 9 24 5 12 0 and 34 1 respectively which indicated that the environment of taihu lake has been seriously disturbed by human beings most of the heavy metal sources in the sediments of taihu lake contribute 74 4 of the cd fig 5 c this phenomenon needs to be given enough attention heavy metals in taihu lake have been obviously and strongly disturbed by human beings taihu lake basin is the largest comprehensive industrial base in china and its electronics machinery chemistry metallurgy textile and other industries account for more than three quarters of its total industrial output value as we all know electronics metallurgy chemistry and other industries are important sources of heavy metal pollution avellaneda et al 2022 in the process of production and processing it is inevitable to discharge waste rich in heavy metals into the surrounding environment 3 3 cluster analysis of sink sediment attributes the properties of sediments in the collection area can significantly affect the enrichment of pollutants to a certain extent the sediment attribute data of taihu lake were tested and described table s2 the average concentration of sediment toc was 17 7 mg kg 1 with a variation range of 11 8 32 6 mg kg 1 the average proportion of clay particles was 11 3 and the variation range was 7 19 the average proportion of silt was 79 2 and the variation range was 73 86 the average proportion of sand is 9 5 and the variation range is 3 17 the high content of toc in sediments was mainly distributed in zhushan bay meiliang bay gonghu bay and east taihu lake fig s2a and the toc content is relatively low in the southern western and central areas of taiyuan the clay content showed similar spatial distribution characteristics to toc the content of sand and gravel was mainly concentrated in the middle and high sand and gravel areas in western taihu lake and southern taihu lake five years ago the total organic carbon content in taihu lake sediments was 6 86 mg g 1 and the clay content was 11 0 in contrast the content of clay particles in taihu lake sediments has not changed while the content of total organic matter has increased significantly which indicates that the accumulation of organic matter in taihu lake sediments has been significantly affected in recent years the correlation between different properties of sediments and various heavy metals is obvious table s3 there was a significant positive correlation between toc and clay content and various heavy metals while there was no significant correlation between gravel and silt content and various heavy metals by taking the concentration indices of heavy metals in sediments as species factors and sediment particle size toc and other indices as environmental factors redundancy analysis was carried out the analysis results are shown in fig 5a and 5b the contents of toc and clay particles in sediments of taihu lake have significant effects on all heavy metals and their influence degrees reach 28 6 and 69 2 respectively which largely determines the enrichment capacity of heavy metals in sediments the content of sediment silt and sand has a weak effect on the enrichment of heavy metals the characteristics of sediment toc and particle size affect or determine the enrichment capacity of heavy metals and other pollutants to a great extent and pose a potential threat to the ecological security of lakes to clarify the combined characteristics of different attribute indices of sediments in taihu lake and classify the combined characteristics of different attributes this study carried out cluster analysis k means clustering on different attribute indices of sediments in the k means clustering algorithm the number of categories k had an important impact on the accuracy of the clustering results but usually the accurate value of k was unknown at first if k was greater than the true value the same class of data will be wrongly divided into multiple classes which will lead to the fuzzy boundary of the clustering results in contrast merging different categories of data into the same category will reduce the compactness of the cluster therefore clustering stability was usually used to determine the k value luxburg et al 2010 bendavid et al 2007 the basic idea of this method was that if the same sample data wre clustered repeatedly the appropriate k value should produce the same or similar clustering results i e stability was regarded as the index of whether the k value is appropriate according to the clustering stability test results it was finally determined to cluster all driving units into three categories tables s6 s7 because there was no change or only a small change in the cluster centre convergence was realized the maximum absolute coordinate change of any centre was 0 the current iteration was 7 and the minimum distance between the initial centres was 8 506 according to the cluster analysis there were significant differences among the three types of sediments table s7 the contents of toc clay silt and sand of the first type of sediment were 23 9 g kg 1 14 2 78 0 and 8 7 respectively the contents of toc clay silt and sand of the second type of sediment attribute were 19 5 g kg 1 11 8 80 7 and 8 7 respectively the contents of toc clay silt and sand of the third type of sediment attribute were 15 2 g kg 1 10 3 78 8 and 9 3 respectively in summary there were obvious differences in the attribute characteristics of the three types of sediments the first type of sediment had the highest content of organic matter and clay had a strong adsorption capacity for heavy metals and other pollutants and was basically distributed in the lake bay area fig s2b this area is strongly disturbed by human activities therefore the area of the first type of sediment was determined to be a potential high pollution risk area the content of organic matter and clay particles in the second type of sediment was relatively high and the adsorption capacity of heavy metals and other pollutants was relatively strong which was roughly distributed in the lake bay and the area near the shore this area also receives relatively strong interference from human activities therefore the area of the second type of sediment was determined to be a potential medium risk area the third type of sediment had the lowest content of organic matter and clay the adsorption capacity of heavy metals and other pollutants was very small and the content of gravel was the highest it was mainly distributed in southern taiyuan and the central area and the interference from human activities was weak therefore the area of the third type of sediment was determined as a potential low risk area the proportions of potential high risk areas medium risk areas and low risk areas of heavy metals in sediments of taihu lake are 5 6 27 6 and 66 8 respectively 3 4 identification of potential risk areas combined with the sources of heavy metals in sediments and the attribute characteristics of sediments in the collection area we established a new method to comprehensively evaluate the pollution risk status of heavy metals in sediments from the following three aspects the ecological risk of heavy metals in sediments the spatial clustering characteristics of anthropogenic sources of heavy metals and the attribute clustering characteristics of sediments in the collection area if the geoaccumulation index igeo details are in the supplementary materials was greater than 0 it indicated that there was an ecological risk of heavy metals in sediments if the geoaccumulation index was less than 0 it indicated that there was no ecological risk of heavy metals in sediments there were three spatial clustering characteristics of anthropogenic heavy metal concentrations high high low low and not significant high high means that each point in the area is surrounded by high concentration points of heavy metals indicating that the area has high pollution risk low low means that each point in the area is surrounded by low concentration points of heavy metals indicating that the area has no pollution risk or low pollution risk the nonsignificant area runs through the points of high concentration and low concentration showing an irregular state there may or may not be heavy metal pollution risk in this area to some extent the attribute characteristics of sediments in the collection area determine the enrichment capacity of pollutants and become a potential risk index according to cluster analysis the sediment attributes of taihu lake were divided into three cluster combinations potential high risk areas potential risk areas and potential low risk areas according to the established comprehensive risk assessment method the study divides the risk status of taihu lake into five types high risk control area potential high risk control area potential risk control area potential low risk control area and low risk control area for example if an area exceeds the ecological risk threshold of heavy metals the spatial clustering characteristics of anthropogenic sources of heavy metals show a high high area or the clustering of sediment attributes shows potential risks this area is the health risk control zone of heavy metal pollution the classification of different levels of potential risk control areas is mainly based on the clustering characteristics of sediment attributes and the special circumstances of the other two factors are also considered the specific classification information and standards are shown in table s8 combined with the established new comprehensive risk assessment method for sediments this study divided the risk status of various heavy metals in taihu lake sediments fig 6 the high risk control areas of heavy metal pb in sediments are mainly distributed in zhushan bay meiliang bay and gonghu bay and the potential high risk control areas were mainly distributed in xukou bay and east taihu lake accounting for 7 4 and 2 6 respectively potential risk control areas and potential low risk control areas were mainly distributed in the lake bay and near the lake shore and low risk control areas were mainly distributed in the centre of the lake accounting for 35 9 25 6 and 28 5 respectively the comprehensive risk zoning of sediment heavy metals cr mn ni cu and zn showed similar characteristics to pb fig s3 the high risk control area of heavy metal cd in sediments was mainly distributed in west taihu lake and zhushan bay the potential risk control area covers almost the whole taihu lake and the distribution area of the potential high risk control area and low risk control area was very small accounting for 14 7 80 6 3 2 and 1 5 respectively based on this pollution zoning the environmental management department can take different governance measures according to different pollution conditions of heavy metals in sediments for example for high risk and potentially high risk control areas measures such as regular dredging and algae removal can be taken to cut off the enrichment of heavy metals for potential risk areas we can strengthen the restriction intensity of lake operation activities in this area and observe sediment and water quality in real time environmental managers should recommend the generalization of domestic and industrial wastewater treatment and the implementation of equipment such as constructed wetlands aimed at depurating rainwaters flowing on streets roads and pavements in addition regarding all measures to be taken in all areas of lake taihu environmental managers should recommend the generalization of domestic and industrial wastewater treatment and the implementation of equipment such as constructed wetlands aimed at depurating rainwaters flowing on streets roads and pavements this method has been well applied in this study and addressed gaps for the study of classification methods for indicators lacking classification thresholds such as sediment attributes the newly established slisa sca model combined the risk clustering characteristics of the sediment heavy metal source sink and its own pollution risk level to make a reasonable risk zoning for the study area and the model reduced the uncertainty of risk identification and zoning caused by only using spatial interpolation compared with other technologies the slisa sca model has stronger reliability and a wider scope of application for risk identification and management table 2 however there were still some problems in this model that need to be further improved 1 the bioavailability of different forms of heavy metals in sediments varies greatly if conditions permit it is best to test the content of free and residual heavy metals in sediments to better evaluate the ecological risk of heavy metals in sediments 2 black carbon components such as char and soot have strong adsorption these indicators can also be considered when classifying sediment attributes 4 conclusions lake sediments are in a closed environment in which heavy metals and other pollutants are rapidly enriched when the lake environment is disturbed various pollutants in the sediment will be released again posing a greater threat to the surrounding human health and ecological environment the study of the risk of heavy metal pollution in the lake system is complex and the heavy metals in the area with a great impact of human activities show a strong enrichment at this point which will strengthen the spatial heterogeneity of heavy metals lisa can overcome this defect and is a good method to identify specific pollutant hotspots in addition the toc and clay properties of sediments have a strong ability to adsorb heavy metals and other pollutants which can greatly increase the potential ecological risk of heavy metals in sediments this study used a model to analyse the anthropogenic and natural sources of heavy metals in taihu lake sediments and found that human activities significantly accelerated the enrichment of heavy metals in sediments using lisa and k means clustering analysis the spatial clustering characteristics of heavy metal elements and attribute characteristics in sediments are analysed and different potential risk types caused by sediment attributes were identified based on this the slisa sca model established in this study from the perspective of source sinks comprehensively considers the risks caused by pollution sources and sediment attributes to sediments and divides taihu lake into a high risk control area potential high risk control area potential medium risk control area potential risk control area potential low risk control area and low risk control area the slisa sca model reduced the uncertainty of risk identification and zoning and provides a more intuitive and objective spatial view of heavy metal risk management and control compared with other technologies this model had stronger reliability and a wider scope of application for risk identification and management and this research provides important technical and theoretical support for the management of river and lake pollution declaration of competing interest the

15548,the anomalous past two years of the covid 19 pandemic have been a test of human response to global crisis management as typical human activities were significantly altered the covid instigated anthropause has illustrated the influence that humans and the biosphere have on each other especially given the variety of national mobility interventions that have been implemented globally these local covid 19 era restrictions influenced human ecosystem interactions through changes in accessibility of water systems and changes in ecosystem service demand four urban aquatic case studies in the netherlands demonstrated shifts in human demand during the anthropause for instance reduced boat traffic in amsterdam canals led to improved water clarity in comparison ongoing service exploitation from increased recreational fishing use of bathing waters and national parks visitation are heightening concerns about potential ecosystem degradation we distilled management lessons from both the case studies as well as from recent literature pertaining to ecological intactness and social relevance equally important to the lessons themselves however is the pace at which informed management

test of human response to global crisis management as typical human activities were significantly altered searle et al 2021 this phenomenon coined an anthropause rutz et al 2020 can be viewed as an intentional and abrupt cessation of human behaviour patterns in response to disruption from a pandemic covid 19 pollution disaster chernobyl environmental catastrophe hurricane katrina or military intervention korean demilitarized zone searle et al 2021 few times in recorded human history has such a pause occurred at this all encompassing global and sectoral scale while also being well documented efforts to contain covid 19 have resulted in varying degrees of national interventions to limit human contact that ranged from social distancing measures to selective travel restrictions to full lockdowns primc and slabe erker 2020 in europe most countries imposed various mobility restrictions from spring 2020 winter 2021 with the severity of the restrictions following the wax and wane

march et al 2021 and increases in others recreation in urban nature spaces venter et al 2020 our water systems have demonstrated a ripple effect of the covid 19 anthropause on the biosphere some of the shifts and reductions in human activities have been attributed to positive system changes such as moratoriums of industrial heavy metal pollution or reduced commercial fishing pressures mandal 2020 however not all anthropause trends provided a respite for aquatic systems human activities have also negatively affected water systems such as with beach overcrowding instigating littering miller rushing et al 2021 zielinski and botero 2020 and publicly applied disinfectants entering surface waters chu et al 2021 all water systems are uniquely defined by their location hydromorphology human

been suggested in the context of social ecological models mooij et al 2019 in reviewing literature from the covid 19 anthropause we saw a lag in the number of papers aimed at discerning the effects of the pandemic on surface waters in highly urbanized areas below we address this gap by reflecting on the implications that the pandemic anthropause has had on the human ecosystem management interactions by defining this relationship and presenting case studies of recreational service demands for water bodies in the netherlands finally from the case study observations and with evidence from recent literature we derive management lessons regarding best practices for future implementation 2 conceptual framing of human ecosystem management interactions the sheer magnitude of human

et al 2009 as is already illustrated with the negative feedback of deteriorating water system functions on present day societies folke et al 2021 management of aquatic ecosystems requires accounting for the interlinked connections between human built and natural systems separately these two types of systems span numerous sectors and are based on complex connections amongst various drivers demands and feedbacks dpsir framework tscherning et al 2012 however considering the implications of one system in isolation from the other is a disservice to both humans and the biosphere as there can be connections and repercussions between the interlinked systems that are unaccounted for understanding and working with both types of systems particularly with elaborating on the feedback from human nature interactions ecosystem services and services to ecosystems connections comberti et al 2015 can facilitate beneficial outcomes to ecosystem functioning and human uses frameworks such as the ipbes conceptual framework díaz et al 2015 integrate knowledge from multiple sources by making explicit linkages between the elements of human well being biodiversity and ecosystems ecosystems goods and services natural and anthropogenic drivers and anthropogenic assets further the framework draws the connection of this knowledge to governance and decision making 3 changes to ecosystem service demand human settlements have a long history of placement in proximity to water systems including today with over 50 of the global population living within 3 km of freshwater bodies kummu et al 2011 and with many urban centers still situated in relation to rivers di baldassarre et al 2013 lakes trudeau and richardson 2016 and other water bodies the biosphere s water systems are capable of providing abundant ecosystem services though limitations can arise depending upon the degree of ecosystem functioning the rate of service exploitation and if there is demand for competing finite water services or resources during the covid 19 anthropause there have been abrupt shifts in typical service demands in response to local pandemic measures such as with use of blue spaces for recreation we will illustrate examples of changes in ecosystem demand under the covid 19 anthropause with four case studies from dutch water systems in the netherlands strict pandemic restrictions starting 15 march 2020 resulted in episodic closing of schools and non essential businesses restricted international travelling limited house visits and social distancing covid 19 pandemic in the netherlands 2021 these restrictions bore consequences for outdoor activities due to changing demand for aquatic cultural services of recreational boating and swimming cices 6 1 1 1 recreational fishing cices 1 1 6 1 and shoreline walking cices 3 1 1 2 classification codes from cices version 5 1 see seelen et al 2022 3 1 decreased human activities recreational boating the reduction of recreational boating in amsterdam canals during the pandemic had an impact on the underwater ecosystem a large portion of this reduced pressure has been attributed to the suspension of international tourism international tourism and covid 19 tourism dashboard 2022 boating traffic data was obtained from the tracking of receiver outfitted boats through the municipality of amsterdam s the digital canal programme de digitalegracht 2022 to discern general trends of boat movement water transparency data was collected biweekly through secchi depth readings by the amstel gooi and vecht water authority s monitoring programme fig 1 shows the coinciding trends in water quality and boat traffic with less boat activity in the canals since the first lockdown in march 2020 there was an observed decrease in resuspension of solid matter resulting in an increase in water clarity relative to previous years fig 1a c the increased light penetration permitted the establishment of submerged macrophytes fig 1d amsterdamse grachten helderder dan ooit dankzij coronamaatregelen 2020 demonstrating that the diminished demand for one service boating reduced pressure exerted upon the ecosystem and created the conditions for improving another service habitat 3 2 increased human activities fishing bathing and national park visits during the pandemic some human activities intensified as people were seeking solace in the outdoors venter et al 2020 in the netherlands outdoor physical activities were not restricted and therefore public outdoor spaces were possibly utilized more in contrast to boating other recreational activities fishing bathing and national park visits saw a perceived increase in demand during the anthropause as compared to previous years alterations of service demand for fishing bathing and national park visits were not directly or uniformly measured as boating had been we therefore validated this perceived change in services demand with different sources of proxy data to derive shifts in human interests case study data is available at https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 6551591 annual numbers of fishing licenses sold as reported by sportvisserij nederland royal dutch angling association was utilized as proxy data for the number of people interested in or utilizing fishing services we compared reported regional numbers from 2016 to 2020 to trace shifts in trends visualized with ggplot2 fig 2 a illustrates an increase in licenses sold during 2020 as compared to previous years as there were no alterations to fishing legislation license accessibility and license prices during the covid 19 pandemic we infer that the increase in licenses sold is due to an increased demand during the anthropause while humans can benefit mentally and physically from such recreational activities venter et al 2020 environmental repercussions can arise if the activities are not managed for instance having an increased number of anglers using a limited number of fishing locations can negatively affect fish through the more frequent exertion of stress even with catch and release practices brownscombe et al 2017 additionally having a finite number of sanctioned fishing locations could instigate angling in undesignated unmanaged water systems further unsanctioned practices could occur with self stocking of angling or bait fish in the water system effectively altering the local food web dynamic matern et al 2018 bathing water areas similarly garnered more public interest during the anthropause as derived from proxy data comparing public interest through the measure of google search trends before and during the pandemic search term zwemmen buiten english translation swimming outside from 2016 to 2020 searched on 4 october 2021 fig 2b we visualized the trends in searches for bathing waters and compared the pre pandemic data to the pandemic period using a loess smoothing function jacoby 2000 and wilcoxon signed rank test wilcox test wilcoxon rank sum and signed rank tests 2022 assuming that increased search behaviour translates in increased human traffic e g clark et al 2019 at the swimming sites the increased demand raises concern over the risk of spreading covid 19 with numerous individuals from different households being in close proximity at these sites publieksvoorlichting 2021 other health risks are also concerning as the demand for bathing opportunities can lead to people swimming in non designated sites as these unsanctioned locations are not subject to monitoring under the european union s bathing directive swimmers can be exposed to pathogens and contract illnesses from an environmental perspective there is the omnipresent concern that increases in crowds heighten the likelihood of pollutants such as microbial exposure and increased turbidity e g graczyk et al 2010 from the pandemic additional concerns arise with macro or microplastics from littered personal protective gear ammendolia et al 2021 being introduced into the system and affecting the biota parashar and hait 2021 alterations in accessibility of urban water services during the pandemic such as through the closure or limited capacity of recreation areas could lead to increased use of blue green spaces outside of city limits google search trends for national park locations was used as a proxy dataset for human demand in shoreline walking trend data for the park names from 2016 to 2020 searched on 3 june 2021 fig 2c 2020 pandemic data was visualized and compared against pre pandemic data using the loess smoothing function jacoby 2000 and wilcoxon signed rank test wilcox test wilcoxon rank sum and signed rank tests 2022 interest in dutch national parks containing wetlands or open water systems was perceived to increase during the anthropause as compared to previous years given the connection between blue green spaces and mental health pouso et al 2021 it can be hypothesized that prolonged immobility in urban centers the anthropause can bolster an interest in spending time in blue green spaces including systems in non urban areas with the observed shift in water systems use there are concerns about pressures that could be introduced with the increased demand similar to bathing waters increased water system use can lead to increased littering parashar and hait 2021 further concerns include the additional anthropogenic noise pollution templeton et al 2021 from more visitors disturbing inhabitants fish birds mammals and the increased foot traffic causing physical wear of shorelines and pathways salesa and cerdà 2020 4 lessons learned from the anthropause for water quality management the covid 19 anthropause permitted an unplanned experiment with shifted human pressures on water systems the first of its kind in the anthropocene chowdhury et al 2021 in some systems the anthropause has shown us visions of desirable futures pereira et al 2020 as society hits play from this anthropause distilling the management lessons learned from the pandemic induced shift in human ecosystem interactions in order to maintain the positive social and ecological covid 19 outcomes in water systems will be important both for immediate and future management applications anthropause derived insights should therefore be disseminated for adoption in management decisions and policies chowdhury et al 2021 particularly given the hyper connectivity of our current societal and economic activities which can easily instigate future pandemics and associated anthropauses de senerpont domis and teurlincx 2020 while plenty of recent studies have hinted towards the pertinence of implementing the anthropause takeaways into management and policies few elaborate on what specific lessons can be applied to urban water system management in this section we highlight six lessons for enhancing management of water systems with the sustainability principles of ecological intactness and social relevance smith et al 2021 based on evidence from both covid 19 era papers and our dutch case study observations working within a water system s constraints is the first step in maintaining optimal human ecosystem interactions therefore defining ecosystem service operating and accessibility guidelines according to ecological needs i e ecological intactness as through a services to ecosystems approach comberti et al 2015 can support management of human ecosystem interactions three ecological based takeaway lessons include the following 4 1 define recreational ecosystem service use thresholds boundaries for utilizing water systems can be set to avoid compromising vital functions or overtaxing uses as our analysis of boating data showed temporary cessation of boating can lead to fast changes in habitat to foster these positive developments in water quality in the post covid 19 era zoning canals to designate specific boating pathways can delineate areas for habitat and other water usage in addition limits can be placed on the number of people utilizing the system such as with bathing areas having a maximum number of swimmers that can be present simultaneously and over the course of a time period 4 2 establish short term anthropauses as observed from the most restrictive periods of the anthropause cessation of human interference permitted water system improvements e g loh et al 2021 enacting intermittent periods of restricted access after the pandemic could similarly promote periods for recovery especially for vulnerable systems for instance no boating periods in amsterdam canals during spring vegetation growth periods can permit habitat establishment rotating access to bathing fishing and scenic water systems can also decentralize recreational pressures for individual sites and mitigate synergistic pressures stemming from chronic system use sanjari et al 2009 further research will be needed to ascertain the duration of the improved ecosystem conditions and methods for maintaining the recovery after anthropauses end 4 3 continue scientific monitoring and intersectoral research despite the abrupt onset of covid 19 existing ecological and social research programs such as the amsterdam canal water quality monitoring network and various citizen science projects have supported knowledge gathering even during society s tumultuous adjustment period continuing to support scientific research and engaging with science management intersectoral collaborations can safeguard knowledge production from future disruptions fulfillment of water system uses for society s needs i e social relevance is an additional aspect that has been affected by the anthropause here we reflect on three lessons for optimizing social investment in urbanized water systems 4 4 identify the new recreators the anthropause may have bolstered recreator numbers as lockdown conditions permitted some individuals to have more time and opportunities to explore local natural spaces venter et al 2020 identifying which community demographics increased their use of nature during this time period and reviewing what systems were utilized urban versus rural green or blue spaces could help develop management practices that foster the continued engagement of people with water ecosystems post anthropause de senerpont domis and teurlincx 2020 4 5 identify societal barriers to blue green spaces blue green spaces tend to be unequally distributed throughout urban communities as was highlighted with covid 19 lockdown restrictions pouso et al 2021 managing and creating these systems to be more accessible to all people can help bolster individual and community health venter et al 2020 conferring with marginalized groups about their experiences before and during the pandemic can help identify these accessibility issues and develop solutions dushkova et al 2021 4 6 improve existing infrastructure existing and future water system infrastructure can be improved to sustainably accommodate more visitors for instance durable pathways can be installed to prevent erosion of paths bates et al 2020 mapping locations of frequent litter accumulations and installing refuse or recycling bins can help maintain the integrity of the water system and aesthetics of the surrounding area ammendolia et al 2021 building sanitation stations hand sanitizer dispensers to support hygiene during the pandemic and in e g influenza season can protect visitor health miller et al 2021 of importance for all anthropause derived management suggestions is the pace that knowledge is implemented under pandemic circumstances numerous communities are aware of and invested in the value that the biosphere provides soga et al 2021 and likely to be more receptive to management actions that support continued water functioning and service provisioning klenert et al 2020 however it is uncertain what proportion of nature enthusiasts will retain the same high regard and valuation of natural systems once other sources of recreation wellness and businesses re open mcginlay et al 2020 there are too many present day drivers of ecosystem degradation to not leverage every opportunity for stimulating positive informed and preemptive action strokal and kroeze 2020 acting in the current pandemic window to maintain the remembrance of human and nature interconnectedness might have a good return on investment in establishing pertinent policies in the post pandemic numerous institutions ipcc ipbes and initiatives un decade of ecosystem restoration are similarly striving for a paradigm shift with water as a source of life not just a resource to use seelen et al 2019 fostering a more eco centric mindset in society going forward can subsequently promote prolonged and sustainable human nature interactions which will be paramount for handling climate change extreme climatic events societal evolution and future pandemics 5 conclusions recent literature has demonstrated that human responses to the covid 19 anthropause have had tremendous reach with implications extending to numerous sectors and systems including aquatic ecosystems which are susceptible to anthropogenic pressures previously published studies illustrate that the effects of the anthropause positive or negative on water systems depended on a combination of the local health mandates lockdowns social distancing requirements societal values ecosystem service use and demand and the water system itself type ecological health dutch urban water systems have experienced mixed effects on water uses during the anthropause that were linked to changes in ecosystem service accessibility and demand distilling the lessons from urban systems and implementing best practices during or soon after the pandemic can help retain society s positive perceptions and valuation of ecosystems foster more environmentally conscious communities and establish environmentally focused management practices credit authorship contribution statement

could instigate angling in undesignated unmanaged water systems further unsanctioned practices could occur with self stocking of angling or bait fish in the water system effectively altering the local food web dynamic matern et al 2018 bathing water areas similarly garnered more public interest during the anthropause as derived from proxy data comparing public interest through the measure of google search trends before and during the pandemic search term zwemmen buiten english translation swimming outside from 2016 to 2020 searched on 4 october 2021 fig 2b we visualized the trends in searches for bathing waters and compared the pre pandemic data to the pandemic period using a loess smoothing function jacoby 2000 and wilcoxon signed rank test wilcox test wilcoxon rank sum and signed rank tests 2022 assuming that increased search behaviour translates in increased human traffic e g clark et al 2019 at the swimming sites the increased demand raises concern over the risk of spreading covid 19 with numerous individuals from different households being in close proximity at these sites publieksvoorlichting 2021 other health risks are also concerning as the demand for bathing opportunities can lead to people swimming in non designated sites as these unsanctioned locations are not subject to monitoring under the european union s bathing directive swimmers can be exposed to pathogens and contract illnesses from an environmental perspective there is the omnipresent concern that increases in crowds heighten the likelihood of pollutants such as microbial exposure and increased turbidity e g graczyk et al 2010 from the pandemic additional concerns arise with macro or microplastics from littered personal protective gear ammendolia et al 2021 being introduced into the system and affecting the biota parashar and hait 2021 alterations in accessibility of urban water services during the pandemic such as through the closure or limited capacity of recreation areas could lead to increased use of blue green spaces outside of city limits google search trends for national park locations was used as a proxy dataset for human demand in shoreline walking trend data for the park names from 2016 to 2020 searched on 3 june 2021 fig 2c 2020 pandemic data was visualized and compared against pre pandemic data using the loess smoothing function jacoby 2000 and wilcoxon signed rank test wilcox test wilcoxon rank sum and signed rank tests 2022 interest in dutch national parks containing wetlands or open water systems was perceived to increase during the anthropause as compared to previous years given the connection between blue green spaces and mental health pouso et al 2021 it can be hypothesized that prolonged immobility in urban centers the anthropause can bolster an interest in spending time in blue green spaces including systems in non urban areas with the observed shift in water systems use there are concerns about pressures that could be introduced with the increased demand similar to bathing waters increased water system use can lead to increased littering parashar and hait 2021 further concerns include the additional anthropogenic noise pollution templeton et al 2021 from more visitors disturbing inhabitants fish birds mammals and the increased foot traffic causing physical wear of shorelines and pathways salesa and cerdà 2020 4 lessons learned from the anthropause for water quality management the covid 19 anthropause permitted an unplanned experiment with shifted human pressures on water systems the first of its kind in the anthropocene chowdhury et al 2021 in some systems the anthropause has shown us visions of desirable futures pereira et al 2020 as society hits play from this anthropause distilling the management lessons learned from the pandemic induced shift in human ecosystem interactions in order to maintain the positive social and ecological covid 19 outcomes in water systems will be important both for immediate and future management applications anthropause derived insights should therefore be disseminated for adoption in management decisions and policies chowdhury et al 2021 particularly given the hyper connectivity of our current societal and economic activities which can easily instigate future pandemics and associated anthropauses de senerpont domis and teurlincx 2020 while plenty of recent studies have hinted towards the pertinence of implementing the anthropause takeaways into management and policies few elaborate on what specific lessons can be applied to urban water system management in this section we highlight six lessons for enhancing management of water systems with the sustainability principles of ecological intactness and social relevance smith et al 2021 based on evidence from both covid 19 era papers and our dutch case study observations working within a water system s constraints is the first step in maintaining optimal human ecosystem interactions therefore defining ecosystem service operating and accessibility guidelines according to ecological needs i e ecological intactness as through a services to ecosystems approach comberti et al 2015 can support management of human ecosystem interactions three ecological based takeaway lessons include the following 4 1 define recreational ecosystem service use thresholds boundaries for utilizing water systems can be set to avoid compromising vital functions or overtaxing uses as our analysis of boating data showed temporary cessation of boating can lead to fast changes in habitat to foster these positive developments in water quality in the post covid 19 era zoning canals to designate specific boating pathways can delineate areas for habitat and other water usage in addition limits can be placed on the number of people utilizing the system such as with bathing areas having a maximum number of swimmers that can be present simultaneously and over the course of a time period 4 2 establish short term anthropauses as observed from the most restrictive periods of the anthropause cessation of human interference permitted water system improvements e g loh et al 2021 enacting intermittent periods of restricted access after the pandemic could similarly promote periods for recovery especially for vulnerable systems for instance no boating periods in amsterdam canals during spring vegetation growth periods can permit habitat establishment rotating access to bathing fishing and scenic water systems can also decentralize recreational pressures for individual sites and mitigate synergistic pressures stemming from chronic system use sanjari et al 2009 further research will be needed to ascertain the duration of the improved ecosystem conditions and methods for maintaining the recovery after anthropauses end 4 3 continue scientific monitoring and intersectoral research despite the abrupt onset of covid 19 existing ecological and social research programs such as the amsterdam canal water quality monitoring network and various citizen science projects have supported knowledge gathering even during society s tumultuous adjustment period continuing to support scientific research and engaging with science management intersectoral collaborations can safeguard knowledge production from future disruptions fulfillment of water system uses for society s needs i e social relevance is an additional aspect that has been affected by the anthropause here we reflect on three lessons for optimizing social investment in urbanized water systems 4 4 identify the new recreators the anthropause may have bolstered recreator numbers as lockdown conditions permitted some individuals to have more time and opportunities to explore local natural spaces venter et al 2020 identifying which community demographics increased their use of nature during this time period and reviewing what systems were utilized urban versus rural green or blue spaces could help develop management practices that foster the continued engagement of people with water ecosystems post anthropause de senerpont domis and teurlincx 2020 4 5 identify societal barriers to blue green spaces blue green spaces tend to be unequally distributed throughout urban communities as was highlighted with covid 19 lockdown restrictions pouso et al 2021 managing and creating these systems to be more accessible to all people can help bolster individual and community health venter et al 2020 conferring with marginalized groups about their experiences before and during the pandemic can help identify these accessibility issues and develop solutions dushkova et al 2021 4 6 improve existing infrastructure existing and future water system infrastructure can be improved to sustainably accommodate more visitors for instance durable pathways can be installed to prevent erosion of paths bates et al 2020 mapping locations of frequent litter accumulations and installing refuse or recycling bins can help maintain the integrity of the water system and aesthetics of the surrounding area ammendolia et al 2021 building sanitation stations hand sanitizer dispensers to support hygiene during the pandemic and in e g influenza season can protect visitor health miller et al 2021 of importance for all anthropause derived management suggestions is the pace that knowledge is implemented under pandemic circumstances numerous communities are aware of and invested in the value that the biosphere provides soga et al 2021 and likely to be more receptive to management actions that support continued water functioning and service provisioning klenert et al 2020 however it is uncertain what proportion of nature enthusiasts will retain the same high regard and valuation of natural systems once other sources of recreation wellness and businesses re open mcginlay et al 2020 there are too many present day drivers of ecosystem degradation to not leverage every opportunity for stimulating positive informed and preemptive action strokal and kroeze 2020 acting in the current pandemic window to maintain the remembrance of human and nature interconnectedness might have a good return on investment in establishing pertinent policies in the post pandemic numerous institutions ipcc ipbes and initiatives un decade of ecosystem restoration are similarly striving for a paradigm shift with water as a source of life not just a resource to use seelen et al 2019 fostering a more eco centric mindset in society going forward can subsequently promote prolonged and sustainable human nature interactions which will be paramount for handling climate change extreme climatic events societal evolution and future pandemics 5 conclusions recent literature has demonstrated that human responses to the covid 19 anthropause have had tremendous reach with implications extending to numerous sectors and systems including aquatic ecosystems which are susceptible to anthropogenic pressures previously published studies illustrate that the effects of the anthropause positive or negative on water systems depended on a combination of the local health mandates lockdowns social distancing requirements societal values ecosystem service use and demand and the water system itself type ecological health dutch urban water systems have experienced mixed effects on water uses during the anthropause that were linked to changes in ecosystem service accessibility and demand distilling the lessons from urban systems and implementing best practices during or soon after the pandemic can help retain society s positive perceptions and valuation of ecosystems foster more environmentally conscious communities and establish environmentally focused management practices credit authorship contribution statement

15549,deep learning techniques and algorithms are emerging as a disruptive technology with the potential to transform global economies environments and societies they have been applied to planning and management problems of urban water systems in general however there is lack of a systematic review of the current state of deep learning applications and an examination of potential directions where deep learning can contribute to solving urban water challenges here we provide such a review covering water demand forecasting leakage and contamination detection sewer defect assessment wastewater system state prediction asset monitoring and urban flooding we find that the application of deep learning techniques is still at an early stage as most studies used benchmark networks synthetic data laboratory or pilot systems to test the performance of deep learning methods with no practical adoption reported leakage detection is perhaps at the forefront of receiving practical implementation into day to day operation and management of urban water systems compared with other problems reviewed five research challenges i e data privacy algorithmic development explainability and trustworthiness multi agent systems and digital twins are identified as key areas to advance the application and implementation of deep learning in urban water management future research and application of deep learning systems are expected to drive urban water systems towards high intelligence and autonomy we hope this review will inspire research and development that can harness the power of deep learning to help achieve sustainable water management and digitalise the water sector across the world graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords artificial intelligence data analytics deep learning digital twin water management data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction computer simulations have been playing an increasingly significant role in water management since they were pioneered for the planning and design of water resources systems in the harvard water programme in 1955 reuss 2003 physically based models have been developed over many years to represent the urban water system uws at varying levels of complexity and widely used to support its planning operation and management e g iwa 2019 however the advance of physically based models has now essentially stalled due to the challenges in 1 the complexity of uwss and their interactions with other systems such as ecosystems and climate systems particularly in capturing human perceptions behaviours and cascaded impacts 2 the difficulty in determining modelling assumptions various processes and model structures and calibrating a large number of model parameters which can lead to the equifinality problem 3 data scarcity and uncertainty for high resolution modelling 4 intensive computing power required by real time simulation and optimisation and 5 human resources and skills required by model development and maintenance which makes it difficult to transfer from one uws to another on the other hand machine learning which is a subset of artificial intelligence ai allows systems to learn directly from data examples and experience without pre defined rules and is being recognised as a potentially disruptive technology to transform global economies environments and societies the royal society 2017 this is happening against the backdrop of transformations required to address pressing challenges including climate change biodiversity loss and the covid 19 pandemic butler et al 2016 machine learning will undoubtedly play a key role in the transformation of the scientific discipline and practice in the water sector iwa 2019 and help tackle water challenges such as resource efficiency water supply water pollution flooding and drought contributing to achieving the water related united nations sustainable development goals mehmood et al 2020 vinuesa et al 2020 deep learning a subset of machine learning is regarded as one of driving forces for recent breakthroughs in ai deep learning typically uses large multi layer artificial neural networks anns to process large raw data sets thus also termed as deep networks conventional machine learning technologies such as multi layer perceptron mlp neural networks are limited in their ability to process raw data and need domain expertise for data processing before learning deep learning helps to solve this problem and enables automatic feature extraction using multiple levels of representations from raw data to more abstract levels lecun et al 2015 popular deep learning algorithms include convolutional neural networks cnns long short term memory lstm autoencoders graph neural networks gnns and deep reinforcement learning drl these deep learning algorithms have had great success in many areas such as image recognition and have already been applied across a range of industry sectors such as healthcare and finance in the water sector the power of deep learning is increasingly recognised with research publications case studies and applications growing at a rapid speed shen 2018 makropoulos and savic 2019 this is therefore a good point in time to examine the current application of deep learning techniques in urban water management and provide a perspective of deep learning research in advancing water engineering and boosting practical application of dl techniques to real world water problems this paper aims to provide a critical review of the role of deep learning in the planning and management of uwss we will examine the progress of deep learning research and application in key urban water challenges and discuss potential directions where advances in deep learning research are needed to boost the development of intelligent uwss and the digitalisation process in the water sector the remaining paper is organised as below section 2 introduces the advances in deep learning in comparison to conventional machine learning section 3 reviews deep learning application to urban water management including demand prediction leakage detection contamination detection sewer defect and blockage assessment wastewater system prediction urban flooding asset monitoring and system control section 4 presents future research challenges and conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 advances in deep learning historically ai has been through several highs and lows but recently deep learning is driving the development and application of ai across various industries compared to conventional machine learning deep learning has advanced in many aspects as discussed below first it enables the automatic extraction of features from raw data through multiple levels of representation learning starting from raw data to higher more abstract levels lecun et al 2015 this eliminates the requirement of feature engineering and domain knowledge to extract features from raw data before they are fed into machine learning algorithms further this improves the learning capacity through amplification of important patterns and suppression of irrelevant variations in the input data together with the exponential advantage in representing complex non linear functions from stacking a large number of hidden layers in deep networks lecun et al 2015 shen 2018 second the wide adoption of the rectified linear unit activation function which is simply a half wave rectifier f x max x 0 and its variations brings the following advantages goodfellow et al 2016 1 fast training of deep networks due to computation savings from its derivatives which is 1 for a positive input otherwise 0 and error terms 2 solving the vanishing gradient problem due to its higher gradients and linearity 3 allowing the activation of hidden layers to output true zero values for negative inputs which leads to sparse representation a desirable property in representation learning while the sigmoid activation function can only learn to approximate a zero output e g a value very close to zero but not a true zero value third the development of the stochastic gradient descent method has made the training of deep networks very efficient especially for large datasets as it randomly selects a small subset called a mini batch from the training dataset each time and this process is repeated until the training is converged the stochastic gradient descent method has been improved with many extensions such as adam kingma and ba 2015 which has gained popularity for deep learning applications further the network training has been made more computationally efficient and effective with a range of techniques including improved architectures unsupervised pre training weights sharing model compression and distillation and regularization methods e g dropout lecun et al 2015 shen 2018 finally the success of deep learning is also built on the advances in hardware accelerators such as graphics processing units gpu and the availability of large datasets data parallelization is a commonly used gpu strategy for accelerating deep learning training well aligned with mini batch training in the strategy a copy of the network is stored and trained on its own mini batch of data in each gpu and its computed gradients and losses are then transferred to the shared processor e g cpu for aggregation before being rebroadcast to gpus for parameter updates this strategy substantially accelerates the training of deep networks for large datasets and improves the learning capacity of deep networks architectures of several popular deep learning algorithms including autoencoders lstms cnns drl and gnns and their key features are shown in fig 1 together with the conventional multi layer perceptron ann more information about these architectures is provided in supplementary material together with a brief introduction of machine learning and mlp neural networks other networks such as generative adversarial networks gan and transformers vaswani et al 2017 are discussed in the literature xu and liang 2021 goodfellow et al 2016 3 deep learning applications deep learning has been used in a wide range of application areas in urban water management predominantly covering anomaly detection system prediction asset assessment system operation and planning and maintenance fig 2 anomaly detection is a type of diagnostic analytics which aims to identify various failure events e g leakages contamination events blockages and cyber attacks system prediction and asset assessment provide an understanding of the current and future states of the uws being hydraulic or asset conditions system operation planning and maintenance are optimisation problems aiming to identify the best solutions given specific constraints deep learning can play a role in all the key issues in the life cycle of the uws with a diverse range of architectures for different problems at present however there are few well tested deep learning algorithms or products readily available for solving uws problems a number of challenges related to data and algorithmic development hinder the development and implementation of deep learning approaches in the water sector fig 2 the latest applications are reviewed and categorised in detail in the following sections water supply and distribution systems section 3 1 urban wastewater systems section 3 2 urban flooding section 3 3 and cyber security and asset monitoring section 3 4 reinforcement learning as an emerging approach for prescriptive analytics has just started to receive applications in system control and operation hence it is reviewed in section 3 5 gaps in industrial application are discussed in section 3 6 table 1 provides a summary of the latest developments of the key problems reviewed covering the aspects of popular algorithms data requirements case studies and advantages most problems are related to classification anomaly detection and regression tasks using images or time series data cnns lstms and their hybrids are amongst the most popular models for solving these problems 3 1 water supply and distribution systems 3 1 1 demand forecasting demand forecasting is a typical time series forecasting problem which is normally regarded as a supervised learning problem thus lstm models have been predominantly used to learn the time dependence in historical data lstm models are able to predict hourly or sub hourly demands by capturing the features from the previous time step demands without considering other weather and demographic factors a gated recurrent unit gru based rnn was able to achieve more accurate and reliable water demand predictions with 15 min and 24 h forecast horizons than traditional machine learning models guo et al 2018 the performance of lstm models in high temporal resolution i e 15 mins and 1 h demand predictions was further confirmed by mu et al 2020 through comparisons with autoregressive integrated moving average arima support vector machine svm and random forest models in particularly for handling demand spikes lstms are able to predict the daily water demand profile at a 1 h time step in an online learning setting with a few days learning from scratch so they can be used to generate demand predictions for optimising the next day pump operation which is particularly useful for small water suppliers with limited historical data kühnert et al 2021 with the increasing adoption of smart water meters lstms can be used to provide reliable water demand predictions based on water consumption data and thus offer opportunities for water utilities to optimise resources and operations nasser et al 2020 showed that the lstm outperformed svms and random forest models using aggregated 10 minute smart metre data of 2 20 households from a pilot study in cairo however it fails to predict the peak demands recent studies showed that hybrid deep learning models achieve high performance in daily water demand predictions when weather and demographic factors are considered du et al 2021 developed a hybrid lstm model for daily water demand forecasting which combines two lstms with discrete wavelet transformation and principal component analysis to pre process the raw data one lstm uses de noised demand sequence to predict the baseline trend and the other lstm uses the demand residuals to predict the artificial noise while the principal components of weather and holiday factors are also used as input to both networks hu et al 2019 applied the cnn to extract the features of the previous five day water consumption data and the daily maximum temperature before they are passed to the bi directional lstm model for daily water demand prediction and the hybrid cnn lstm model achieved higher predictive accuracy than lstm bi lstm and cnn data preprocessing techniques such as time series signal decomposition can facilitate feature extraction and thus improve the predictive accuracy of gru based models hu et al 2021 in summary previous research shows the lstm and its hybrid algorithms are the most popular deep learning approach for water demand forecasting and they outperform traditional machine learning methods due to the capacity in capturing temporal dependence however applications are limited to short term demand forecasting with the forecast time step of less than one day 3 1 2 leakage detection and localisation deep learning approaches for leakage detection and localisation can be roughly grouped into two categories classification and prediction based approaches the classification approach trains deep learning models on labelled data i e pressure flow acoustic and vibration signals to identify normal and abnormal events a major disadvantage of this approach is the effort in collecting and labelling a large amount of data though hydraulic models can be used to generate synthetic data for training e g javadiha et al 2019 zhou et al 2019b the prediction based approach generally uses deep learning models to predict the system states pressure or flow and then classify the residuals between predicted and measured state values using a threshold in the literature cnns are the predominant deep learning approach to leakage detection and localisation and in most studies they are trained using labelled data to classify normal and abnormal events there are a few prediction based deep learning approaches in the literature and one example used a lstm to predict water demand which achieved a high detection accuracy high true positive rate and low false positive rate wang et al 2020 the following review will focus on the cnns based classification approach organised by data sources i e pressure flow data acoustic vibration and their input format cnns have been trained on pressure data for multi point leakage detection six cnn models were trained by fang et al 2019 using pressure data which were collected from a water distribution system wds in a laboratory platform and manually labelled for leakage events the best cnn model achieved an accuracy of 97 33 and 92 11 when 21 and 8 pressure sensors were used respectively it was observed that accuracy decreases for multi leak events from 96 43 for single point leakage to 91 56 for three point leakage the high accuracies achieved are partially due to the high number of sensors used between 8 and 21 sensors for a network of 400 m which is impractical for real world networks the idea of using hydraulic models to generate pressure data with a large number of leak events for training was proposed by zhou et al 2019b hydraulic models have been used for synthetic data generation before however data were generated under normal conditions with no or limited number of leakage scenarios zhou et al 2019b developed a fully linear densenet to effectively extract leakage features in the wds so that leaks could be localised to the pipe level once trained off line using a large number of leakage signals e g 200 leak events per pipe the model was used online to locate leaks using real time pressure data from in situ or mobile loggers results from two wdss show that the model is able to accurately identify the pipe where leaks occur similarly synthetic leakage data were used for cnn training javadiha et al 2019 and autoencoder training fan et al 2021 however they produced pressure residual maps from the differences between pressure measurements provided by sensors and pressure estimates obtained from a hydraulic network model and then converted the maps to 2d images to train cnns for leakage localisation the pressure residual maps characterise the impact of all possible leak localizations but might be affected by uncertainties in hydraulic modelling indeed the impacts of hydraulic model uncertainties such as random demands and leak sizes were considered when synthetic data are used for leakage localisation javadiha et al 2019 zhou et al 2019b and leakage detection fan et al 2021 acoustic and vibration signals which are generated by leaks from pressure changes by cracks when elastic waves are propagated through the pipe can be learnt by cnns kang et al 2018 nam et al 2021 or autoencoders cody et al 2020 to classify normal or abnormal events kang et al 2018 trained and tested a one dimensional cnn on a dataset consisting of 1580 normal and 660 abnormal 10 second signals pairs collected from six accelerometer sensors in a looped wds in seoul the dataset was segmented into 1 second signals and labelled for learning the detection accuracy was improved by data preprocessing through a general denoising method and a bandpass filter for extraction of leak frequency bands or by integrating a svm into the cnn to provide a diverse feature classification in the study of shukla and piratla 2020 a cnn model adapted from a pre trained alexnet network was used to detect leaks on polyvinyl chloride pvc pipelines using scalogram images which are the wavelet transformation of raw acceleration signals without any preprocessing such as noise reduction or application of filters from an experimental pipeline test bed and it can predict leakage sizes and locations in addition to leakage detection an autoencoder was applied by cody et al 2020 based on spectrograms of acoustic data which uses a 2d cnn for preprocessing of the spectrograms followed by a variational autoencoder layer to reach the latent layer the autoencoder was tested using data collected from a laboratory test bed that was connected to a municipal water system via a service line thus ensuring realistic baseline variation and it achieved an accuracy of 97 2 for detecting a 0 25 l s leak in addition to leakage detection the autoencoder model has been used to detect the anomalies of the internal surface of water pipelines using cctv video jiao et al 2021 the input data format for cnns has been studied in the literature as it is closely related to feature extraction and thus affects the detection accuracy as cnns are well suited for processing 2d images previous research attempted to convert one dimension pressure signals to 2d images for leakage detection and localisation javadiha et al 2019 m zhou et al 2019a or convert acoustic signals to 2d images cody et al 2020 however this process may lead to the loss of some useful information and increase in computational costs zhou et al 2021 thus one dimensional cnns 1d cnns are now often employed to directly process original 1d time series signals for leakage detection and localisation for example 1d cnns were used extract features directly from vibration signals kang et al 2018 and pressure data fang et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 however the raw signals i e acoustic data could be transformed through different techniques such as fast fourier transform fft wavelet transforms and time domain features before being input to a 1d cnn for training rahimi et al 2020 showed that converting the acoustic signal to a 1d image through fft can effectively help detect leakage in plastic and composite water tanks and thus significantly improve the performance of cnns in this direction a new advance is the development of a novel time frequency cnn by guo et al 2021a which can capture the leakage spectrograms through three different resolutions i e high frequency high time and transitional time frequency resolutions attempts to apply cnns to other aspects of leakage detection have been made such as transfer learning to fine tune cnns building on the knowledge from a pre trained cnn model such as alexnet shukla and piratla 2020 zhou et al 2021 and leakage zone identification using spatial clustering and cnns hu et al 2021b further efforts have been made to use satellite images for leakage detection by training a cnn model however such approaches do not support real time continuous monitoring and are more suitable for large leaks and tend to result in high rates of false alarms owing to the resolution of the satellite images shukla and piratla 2020 in summary cnns are the only widely used deep learning method for leakage detection using either flow pressure data or acoustic vibration data and the focus has been on how to best capture anomalous signals by improving training data size or data format transformation however other deep learning algorithms such as lstm gan and gnn should be explored to capture spatial and temporal relationships from multi source and multi site data 3 1 3 contamination and water quality one challenge in anomaly detection in high volume data is the unbalanced data problem due to the typical low frequency of anomalous events and highly variable and dynamic sensor data this was tackled in the water quality anomaly detection competition series organised at the genetic and evolutionary computation conference gecco where the real world drinking water quality dataset used is extremely imbalanced with the ratio of abnormal events being 1 452 only when tested on this dataset a balanced lstm model which includes a fixed rate of 10 positive samples in each batch of training data was shown to achieve a higher f1 score a combined measure of the model s precision and recall of 0 7819 than the standard lstm and other machine learning methods qian et al 2020 using the same data set muharemi et al 2019 also showed that the lstm and a deep network with three hidden layers of six neurons each have a high performance with an f score of 0 9 outperforming traditional machine learning methods except svm when all methods were trained using time series cross validation however all the methods generalized badly to a new data set chen et al 2018a used a 1d cnn consisting of two convolutional two max pooling layers and two fully connected layers each with 128 neurons to extract the features in raw water quality data before they are fed into a bi directional lstm and they claimed the cnn lstm approach was suitable for water quality detection problems but no performance results were provided in general deep learning methods outperform traditional machine learning methods in terms of feature learning accuracy and fewer false positive rates though a fair comparison between different studies is difficult due to different datasets models and parameters employed dogo et al 2019 the broad range of possible anomaly types poses another challenge in water quality anomaly detection water quality data from in situ sensors are likely to encounter the following common anomalies with decreasing priority large sudden spike low variability persistent values constant off set sudden shift data oscillation drift and small sudden spike leigh et al 2019 rodriguez perez et al 2020 applied lstms to classify different types of river water quality anomalies considering two parameters i e turbidity and conductivity separately and they found that sudden spikes and small sudden spikes are more likely to be detected when the lstm model is trained using normal water quality data whereas long term data drift is more likely to be detected when anomalous data are included in the training dataset they concluded that the lstm model considerably minimized false detection rates in comparison with the regression based arima approach though its performance varied for different water quality parameters and monitoring sites water quality anomaly detection has made use of multivariate time series data from water quality sensors this is distinct from leakage detection which normally relies on flow and pressure data or acoustic signals the gecco challenge dataset includes chlorine oxide ph value redox potential electric conductivity turbidity temperature and flow rate so all these parameter data are input into an machine learning model to identify anomaly events directly muharemi et al 2019 however this approach needs labelled data for training in another direction of research machine learning models can be used to predict a water quality parameter value using other parameter data so the residuals between estimated and observed data can be used for outlier classification for each parameter which can then be fused for anomaly event detection arad et al 2013 li et al 2022b to fully exploit complex multivariate correlations gan based approaches have been developed as they can consider the entire variable set concurrently in order to capture the latent spatio temporal interactions amongst the variables it has been shown that gan models are well suited for complex anomaly detection problems and have superior performance over existing unsupervised methods when the generator and discriminator are both represented by a lstm network li et al 2019a gnn based approaches can effectively learn the relationships between multiple sensors and allow users to deduce the root cause of a detected anomaly experiments on two real world sensor datasets show that a novel attention based gnn approach detects anomalies with higher accuracies including precision recall and f1 than baseline approaches including deep autoencoders lstm and gan models deng and hooi 2021 more importantly gnn in particular attention based networks can provide a certain level of interpretability for the detected anomalies as attention weights indicate the importance of the neighbouring nodes sensors in modelling the node s behaviour in summary the availability of open quality data boosted the application of various deep learning methods lstm gan and gnn to contamination detection however their performance needs to be further tested on measured data which represent the multivariate complexity in the real world 3 2 urban wastewater systems 3 2 1 sewer defect and blockage the internal surface condition of sewers is traditionally assessed manually using closed circuit television cctv videos by professional inspectors this process is labour intensive and time consuming in recent years cnns have been widely used for automated sewer defect detection more specifically for the following tasks 1 image classification classifying cctv images according to contained defects 2 object detection identifying the types of defects and their locations 3 semantic segmentation labelling the pixels belonged to a defect image classification kumar et al 2018 trained a series of binary classification cnns each for a single type of defect only to reduce the time required for training a single cnn was set up to classify the frames into multiple defect classes by meijer et al 2019 apart from sewer defects gutierrez mondragon et al 2020 trained a cnn to identify the obstruction level of sewer pipes some popular cnns in the computer vision domain have been tested on sewer defect detection for instance hassan et al 2019 fine tuned alexnet to extract feature maps from sewer frames to tackle the imbalance between the datasets of defective and normal pipes a hierarchical classification structure was used a high level classification that classifies normal and defective pipes followed by a low level classification that classifies defective pipes into specific types of defects xie et al 2019 similarly resnet18 was adopted by li et al 2019b in the hierarchical structure which contains residual learning operations to enhance learning process he et al 2016 chen et al 2018b used a lightweight network called squeezenet for high level classification and inceptionv3 for low level classification due to its relatively high recognition ability various techniques have been considered in cnns to improve efficiency and accuracy for example chen et al 2019 improved a binary classification cnn for sewer defects by introducing a cost sensitive activation layer and cost mean loss kumar et al 2020a leveraged a cnn interpretation technique called class activation mapping to visualize the learnt weights and then guide the adjustments of cnns moreover the text shown in the sewer inspection frames normally includes the pipe property and the driving distance from the starting point which reveals the location of the frames therefore cnns were used to extract the distance and thus determine the location of defective frames moradi et al 2020 object detection prior research aimed to detect not only the types of defects but also the locations of defects in the frames further multiple types of defects may be contained in the same image which is a difficult issue for classification models object detection models can be applied to solve these issues current cnn based approaches can be mainly divided into two groups 1 region based or two stage detection which means that regions of interests need to be first extracted by a separate network 2 one stage detection in which no region is required a two stage detection method called faster r cnn were used by cheng wang 2018 and zhang et al 2018d specifically cheng wang 2018 used the zeiler fergus network as the cnn part for feature extraction while zhang et al 2018d used vgg 16 to extract features in contrast yin et al 2020 used a one stage network called yolov3 for real time automated sewer defect detection kumar et al 2020b carried out a comparison of three methods i e yolov3 faster r cnn and single shot detector and concluded that yolov3 is suitable for onsite detection due to its faster speed while faster r cnn is more suitable for offsite review due to its superior detection accuracy moreover in wang et al 2021a defect tracking was proposed based on the detection results of a faster r cnn to facilitate the counting of the number of defects across consecutive video frames semantic segmentation semantic segmentation models can annotate each pixel of detected objects in the images kunzel et al 2018 applied a two data stream cnn named full resolution residual network frrn to unrolled and stitched cctv frames for automatic detection and classification of defects and structural elements in sewer pipes pan et al 2020 segmented sewer defects by adding feature reuse and attention mechanism blocks in cnn based u net wang cheng 2020 integrated a deep cnn with dilated convolution called dilaseg with a recurrent neural network rnn formulated from dense conditional random field crf where dilaseg works for feature map extraction and crf formulated rnn is responsible for resolving the local ambiguities furthermore sewer condition assessment was proposed by wang et al 2021b to evaluate the severity of operation and maintenance defects based on semantic segmentation results in summary the superpower of cnn based algorithms in image processing has been leveraged for sewer defect detection with yolo and faster r cnn showing a clear advantage over other deep learning and traditional machine learning methods however only a few types of defects were considered in most studies so future work should investigate more defect types aiming to provide a condition assessment for sewers 3 2 2 system state prediction recent research showed that gru and lstm models have a better performance than traditional anns in predicting cso water depth using monitored water depth and rainfall data in a real world case study the deep learning models improve the generalisation for multi site cso prediction by leveraging spatio correlations across multiple sites in addition to making use of temporal trends at individual sites zhang et al 2018a sewer flow and water depth are commonly predicted based on rainfall data and observed flow and water depth data at previous time steps in the case of predicting cso water levels palmitessa et al 2021 investigated the predictive accuracy of lstm networks in scenarios of limited or missing antecedent observations and they found that lstm networks were capable of compensating for the missing observed data with the other input data e g time of the day and rainfall intensity because infiltration process is not negligible use of groundwater level data as an additional input can improve the performance of lstms in predicting the flow at various sites of a sewer system sufi karimi et al 2019 application of predicted system behaviours to operation practices have been demonstrated in the literature the high predictive capability of lstms in sewer flow modelling was used for improving in sewer storage control in order to reduce overflow at the wwtp zhang et al 2018b and for the operation of the wwtp zhang et al 2018c dairi et al 2019 developed a hybrid rnn rbm method to predict multivariate water quality influent time series which was then used for anomaly detection this approach can help monitor and detect abnormal influent conditions that can affect the operation of wwtps thus improving operational resilience amongst six gru and lstm variants the lstm model shows an overall high accuracy in predicting the influent flow influent temperature influent biochemical oxygen demand bod effluent chloride effluent bod and power consumption in a wwtp cheng et al 2020 the cod mass flow in the wwtp was predicted based on 1 minute measured data for temperature ph nh3 n sewage inflow and influent cod with a hybrid cnn lstm model which can support the development of feedforward control systems for aeration and chemical dosing wang et al 2019 similar to demand prediction rnn and lstm models have been predominantly used for prediction of the key state variables of urban wastewater systems including water quality flow and water level at various components and csos in both the sewer system and the wwtp however more work is needed to identify the complex relationships between variables in both wastewater system and demand prediction 3 3 urban flooding 3 3 1 data processing for hydrodynamic flood modelling the predictive accuracy of hydrodynamic flood models significantly relies on high resolution data e g catchment and weather data however the availability of such data is a main challenge in many cities deep learning can play a key role in processing big data of aerial photography lidar data satellite data and radar weather data to generate high resolution multispectral data for improving urban flood modelling pollard et al 2018 deep learning has gained wide application in remote sensing due to its power in information extraction from raw images the most commonly used models are cnns rnns autoencoders and their hybrids applications include image segmentation land use classification terrain attribute extraction object identification e g building bridges and multi source image fusion however a detailed review of these areas is out of the scope of this review and more information can be found in shen 2018 and other reviews in the field of remote sensing and hydrology processing raw images with deep learning provides high resolution urban catchment data particularly useful for areas with low resolution images the availability of semantic information from cnn based classification enables large scale 3d city reconstruction zhu et al 2017 which could be potentially used for flood damage assessment flood emergency planning and real time flood decision analytics notably remote sensing imagery has been used for disaster assessment during a flood event using deep learning yang and cervone 2019 iqbal et al 2021 deep learning can be applied to provide high resolution weather and flood data where no such data are available cnns have been used to improve the accuracy of rainfall nowcasting at high spatial resolution barrington et al 2019 estimate flood extent using images from unmanned aerial vehicles hashemi beni and gebrehiwot 2021 and monitor water depth using cctv videos de vitry et al 2019 and crowdsourced photos alizadeh and behzadan 2021 accurate representation of rainfall and flood depth at high resolution provides high quality data to calibrate urban flood models 3 3 2 urban flood forecasting in the last several years deep learning has been extensively studied for river flow and flood forecasting and fluvial flood inundation in hydrology kabir et al 2020 xu and liang 2021 xu et al 2020 however it has not received much attention in urban pluvial flood predictions mainly due to the challenge in learning large datasets of high resolution urban catchment features li et al 2021 and lack of measured flood and water infrastructure data flood data in urban areas are generally unavailable compared to the availability of long river flow records such as the large data set of 30 years from several hundred basins nearing et al 2021 a few studies have showed that cnns are capable for urban flood prediction one example is a hybrid model developed by guo et al 2021b to predict the maximum flood depth for rainfall events this hybrid model uses a convolutional autoencoder to process the urban catchment data and a feedforward fully connected neural network which is attached to the latent layer of the autoencoder to process the hyetograph data five terrain surface feature maps including elevation slope aspect curvature and masque are divided into patches to train the cnns the model provided accurate predictions for areas of different characteristics e g flat steep around buildings upstream and downstream when tested on three case studies the autoencoder model was later improved by adding skip connections from encoding blocks to decoding blocks applying average pooling in the encoding part and converting rainfall time series into 9 event characteristics löwe et al 2021 cnns were also tested for the assessment of urban surface water flood risks using catchment data and outperformed traditional machine learning methods such as naïve bayes li et al 2021 in summary deep learning has found more applications in data processing than in flood prediction with most algorithms based on cnns however it is worth investigating other architectures such as hybrid cnn lstm algorithms to improve flood predictive accuracy in the future 3 4 cyber security and asset monitoring water and wastewater infrastructure is considered as one of the main targets for cyberattacks amongst 16 critical infrastructure systems by the us department of homeland security and it is not uncommon to see cybersecurity incidents reported for example 25 cyber security incidents were reported in 2015 alone in the us making the water and wastewater sector the third most targeted sector after manufacturing and energy sectors hassanzadeh et al 2020 thus the security of urban water infrastructure has drawn increasing attention in the practical and research communities deep learning methods including lstm autoencoders and gnn models have enabled significant improvements in cyber attack detection in high dimensional datasets a lstm model was developed to detect cyber attacks in a water treatment system and was trained using data under normal conditions and evaluated using 36 different attack scenarios inoue et al 2017 autoencoders were also tested with 14 attack scenarios considering various components such as pumps tanks and controllers in a benchmark water distribution system i e c town and results showed autoencoders substantially outperform traditional machine learning methods i e xgboost and lightgbm taormina and galelli 2018 erba et al 2020 evaluated different evasion attacks which modify anomalous data to evade deep autoencoder based detectors using two datasets from water treatment test bed systems with various attack scenarios a novel attention based gnn approach was shown to outperform a set of baseline models including lstm autoencoders and hybrid models deng and hooi 2021 tsiami and makropoulos 2021 showed that a convolutional gnn was able to leverage the inherent interdependencies of the scada data for cyber attack detection in water distribution systems and interpret model predictions based on feature interdependencies a deep generative model with variational inference was developed for cyber attacks based on autonomously learnt normal system behaviours from raw observations such as pump pressure and tank water level chandy et al 2019 research and innovation in uws development should be prioritised to mitigate the substantial risks and vulnerabilities that are created from water digitalisation and the uptake of ai technologies in the water sector it is particularly urgent to develop cybersecurity best practice guidelines for uwss as part of critical national infrastructure as explained above deep learning based methods including lstm autoencoders and gnn models could be used to increase cybersecurity and enable significant improvements in cyber attack detection in high dimensional datasets for example adversarial machine learning has been used to fool detection algorithms erba et al 2020 and insight gained could help develop new deep learning detection methods these methods however need to be tested with more cyber attack scenarios from the real world uwss and consider network traffic data taormina et al 2018 in addition to anomaly detection deep learning can be developed as a soft sensor or a surrogate model for water asset monitoring it is common that measurements in water systems are not available due to either no sensors or faults in the cyber system soft sensing has been considered as a solution to replace missing measurements primary measurements with predicted values based on the other measurements secondary measurements available 2d cnn and lstm models were trained using one minute operation data collected from 100 sensors for one year in a water treatment works and their results were combined using multiple linear regression to achieve a significantly higher predictive accuracy measured by root mean square errors than individual cnn and lstm models cao et al 2018 this ensemble model can be used as a soft sensor to predict flow and water level in case of any missing data from the 100 sensors similarly lstm models can also provide accurate predictions for key variables in wastewater treatment plants wwtp cheng et al 2020 the use of deep learning models as a surrogate of hydraulic models was also demonstrated using a deep belief network which is a variant of multi layer perceptron networks with stacked restricted boltzmann machines wu and rahman 2017 a gnn based on k localized spectral filtering was used to re construct the pressures at all nodes from a limited number of nodal pressure measurements and this approach was shown achieving a relative error below 5 on average with an observation ratio of 5 when tested with three benchmark networks hajgató et al 2021 this shows the promise of using gnns as a soft sensor or a surrogate model for pressure monitoring across the entire network in addition to system states gnns were used to fill missing pipe attribute data i e diameters and materials in wastewater networks belghaddar et al 2021 a cnn model was used to monitor the changes of the fat oil grease layer and various hydraulic processes in the pump sump in a wastewater system moreno rodenas et al 2021 and could potentially be used to predict pump sump failure in summary cyber security and asset monitoring have received significantly increasing research efforts with a diverse range of algorithms including lstm autoencoders and gnn models tested however the research questions in these areas are similar to those in leakage contamination and blockage detection and localisation and thus data and experience could be shared 3 5 system control and operation drl has emerged as a new technology for real time control and operation and has received applications in many fields including water resources and hydropower reservoir operation xu et al 2021 however drl has not received much attention in uwss applications are mainly reported in urban drainage systems and wwtps which are introduced below only one application was found in water distribution systems and it tested the dqn based drl for pump control using two benchmark water distribution systems i e anytown and d town hajgató et al 2020 the pump speed was determined considering the system states nodal pressures and pump speed ratios and maximizing a reward which was formulated considering the three objectives including the number of nodes exceeding the required pressure ranges pump efficiency and feed ratio of the pumps they showed that the dqn can achieve comparable results to some commonly used optimisation algorithms 3 5 1 flood control of urban drainage systems drl has been used for flood risk management through developing control strategies of retention or detention ponds mullapudi et al 2020 developed a dqn based drl algorithm for real time non predictive control of a distributed stormwater system with multiple detention ponds which has an objective of achieving desired water levels and flows in the system using the water level and outflows at each control site as the state variables the algorithm was effective for control of individual detention ponds but it was proven challenging for system level control with multiple ponds due to temporal dynamics system interactions and high dimensionality research has shown that flood control of urban drainage systems can be improved through policy based deep learning with incorporation of rainfall forecasts into decision making bowes et al 2021 applied a ddpg actor critic algorithm to flood control of urban drainage systems which operates the valves at the bottom of retention ponds different from dqn based approaches this algorithm can control valves over a continuous action space it was tested on a hypothetical urban catchment which has two sub catchments two retention ponds controlled by valves and a tidally influenced water body the outputs from swmm simulations were used to train the algorithm the system state is represented by the current flood depth and volume at the ponds and downstream nodes the current valve positions the sum of the 24 h rainfall forecast for each subcatchment and the mean value of the 24 h tide forecast the actions that the agent can take at any step are to close or open any valve to any degree the reward is formulated based on how well the agent prevents flooding and maintains certain target pond water depths rl is shown to outperform model predictive control mpc and rule based control strategies by effectively learning to proactively manage pond levels using current and forecast conditions further the ddpg algorithm is shown to be robust when considering uncertainties in input data i e rainfall forecasts and system states i e water level saliba et al 2020 previous research has shown the promise of using drl for automated control of urban drainage systems to reduce flooding however a number of challenges arose from learning real time control rules for complex systems for example the formulation of reward functions to guide system behaviours control of multiple distributed storage tanks handling of multiple objectives use of future forecasts and choice of different drl approaches blumensaat et al 2019 bowes et al 2021 mullapudi et al 2020 3 5 2 wastewater treatment plants rl has been applied to reduce operational costs in wwtps using a wwtp benchmark simulation model 1 gernaey et al 2014 hernández del olmo et al 2016 showed that rl can better control the do set points of a proportional integral pi controller considering the system state variables i e ammonium and do concentrations and save operational costs when compared to manual operation and ammonium based pi controllers q learning based rl was also tested for the control of the advanced oxidation process of phenols using fenton s reagent in a laboratory plant syafiie et al 2011 and for optimising the hydraulic retention time of anaerobic and aerobic reactors pang et al 2019 in a model free rl approach it is important to introduce a shadowing period for rl to learn from human operations before the rl agent is deployed to control the wwtp hernández del olmo et al 2018 showed that an initial shadowing period of 30 days improves dramatically the agent s learning speed and reduces significantly the operational cost though a longer shadowing period can make the learning more effective in addition to the traditional rl a few applications of drl have been made in wwtps a policy based drl was developed for energy consumption reduction through controlling pumps between primary and secondary treatment and it used probabilistic inflow forecasts to minimize energy consumption and reduce the number of alarms for tank level exceeding the limits filipe et al 2019 further a multi agent ddpg approach was applied to control dissolved oxygen and chemical dosage in a wwtp under continuous action and state spaces chen et al 2021 in this approach various reward functions were tested in order to develop sustainable control strategies in summary various policy and value based drl approaches have been applied to system control of uwss though the number of applications is limited and most in urban wastewater systems compared to the other deep learning algorithms however there was lack of comparisons of drl applications with non deep learning methods such as evolutionary optimisation 3 6 real world application the application of deep learning methods to uwss is still at an early stage as most reported studies have used benchmark networks synthetic data and laboratory based or pilot systems real world systems and monitoring data have been used in the literature however they were mainly for model development and demonstration of deep learning potential in comparison to traditional machine learning models the studies reviewed generally aimed to demonstrate improved performances of deep learning in comparison to traditional machine learning models or to develop an improved deep learning architecture through comparing different architecture designs to the best of our knowledge there is no reporting of deployed applications into day to day operation and management of real world uwss with measurable benefits or lessons learned from an innovative use of deep learning technology learning that is no deep learning methods have reached the slope of enlightenment stage on the gartner hype cycle curve fig 3 the water applications reviewed have received varying levels of attention and have advanced to different stages of maturity fig 3 leakage detection is the most popular problem for deep learning research in urban water management which is mainly due to data availability and the drive to reduce leakage and resources i e water and energy consumption world wide recall that various sensors have been deployed in the water industry to collect water demand pressure acoustic and vibration data all of which have been applied to leakage detection leakage detection is perhaps in the stage of trough of disillusionment on the gartner hype cycle curve where deep learning fails to deliver the high expectation but interest in developing new methods and tools continues as demonstrated by the battle of the leakage detection and isolation methods liu et al 2019 it is likely to move to the next stage slope of enlightenment where it will receive wider practical implementation a strategy towards wider industrial implementation may involve demonstrating the reliability of deep learning technologies through pilot studies benchmarking with domain knowledge and other existing methods collecting more field data for performance improvement and developing the next generation of deep learning models this process may be iterative and the slope of enlightenment can be long thus it is key to establish close collaborations between deep learning researchers and water companies before mainstream adoption starts to take off reaching the plateau of productivity sewer defect detection is largely at the same stage on the gartner curve as leakage detection this problem was expected to capitalize on the power of deep learning in image processing lecun et al 2015 however challenges have arisen due to lack of large data sets and the effort required for labelling the complexity of various defects and the difficulty in providing direct support for pipe maintenance investments building on more open access images recently made available haurum and moeslund 2021 table 1 research should focus on how deep learning methods are developed to streamline sewer condition assessments for directly supporting investment decisions on the contrary research on contamination detection though having received much attention is based on simplified case studies and data sets and it needs to make a breakthrough in tackling the complexity of real pollution events before reaching the peak of inflated expectations application of deep learning to asset monitoring has received high expectations as part of the recent development of predictive maintenance predictive maintenance seeks to maximize the value of assets throughout their lifecycle building on predicted system states which are normally learnt from large amounts of data compared with other systems such as manufacturing systems where the benefit of predictive maintenance has been demonstrated uwss are more complex with a large number of components and state variables affected by highly uncertain environments but generally with less data for deep learning training the deep learning algorithms developed in the literature are piecemeal unscalable and lack generalisation for real world uwss amongst system state prediction problems short term demand forecasting has received the most attention and achieved high predictive accuracy but medium and long term forecasting suffers from similar data availability and uncertainty challenges in real world problems flood prediction using ai technology at the river basin and catchment scales was rising rapidly in recent years though its role in hydrology is still debated nearing et al 2021 this was partially driven by efforts from big technology companies such as google nevo et al 2019 however the application of deep learning to urban flooding where only a few studies were reported e g guo et al 2021b li et al 2021 needs more research to tackle flood flashiness and high resolution urban features examples of system operation have showed the benefits of drl technology as discussed in section 3 6 which however have not been fully appreciated by the water research communities drl as the only deep learning algorithm that can provide solutions to operation optimisation problems has been mainly tested in the areas of flood control in the sewer system and wastewater treatment operation further it has received many more applications in urban wastewater systems than water distributions systems as reviewed earlier this is not surprising as optimal operation problems traditionally draw more attention in urban wastewater systems than water distribution systems in addition to optimal operation problems drl can also solve optimal long term planning maintenance and management problems fig 2 such as intervention pathway development sadr et al 2020 where solutions at a time step depend on the solutions chosen at previous time steps however it has received no applications in this area the potential impacts and challenges of drl are discussed in the two future research areas multi agent systems and digital twins in sections 4 4 and 4 5 overall it has been demonstrated that deep learning is able to achieve higher efficiency and accuracy than traditional machine learning models when applied to classification anomaly detection and regression tasks in uwss table 1 however significant research gaps remain in the development of deep learning methods to gain more understanding of the processes systematically improve reliability resilience and sustainability of uwss and ultimately building autonomous uwss butler et al 2016 research advances in the areas identified in section 4 will help bridge the gaps and propel the application of deep learning to industrial implementation 4 future research challenges we believe that in time deep learning will fundamentally transform how uwss will be planned managed and operated in response to environmental and social challenges as has already been achieved in some sectors such as the finance and retail sectors the royal society 2017 at the same time deep learning has started to substantially transform some scientific disciplines such as high energy physics astronomy and computational biology shen 2018 and is already transforming water research as reviewed in section 3 here we discuss five potential research challenges that need to be addressed to advance water engineering and science and boost deep learning powered application to solve real world water problems in the face of environmental change fig 4 illustrates the key research areas in addition to research challenges the industrial application of ai in the water sector is affected by many other challenges such as data silo public policy water regulation culture work force institutional management and wider ai ecosystem garrido baserba et al 2020 iwa 2019 which are not discussed in this review 4 1 data privacy the availability of big data was one of the driving factors that lead to the breakthroughs in deep learning at the same time this technology is bringing challenges and risks that are related to data such as availability quality accessibility security privacy and cyber attack for example the high resolution water consumption data from smart meters can reveal personal privacy and behaviours so how can water companies be willing to open their data for deep learning development while they should recognise privacy invasion and associated risks arising from data sharing in the legal framework for data protection such as the new eu general data protection regulation privacy enhancing technologies pets should be developed and deployed to support effective data sharing and collaborative learning over distributed data pets provide a solution to share data and train ai algorithms without the need of pooling data or sharing raw data this might be particularly suitable for deep learning based approaches which could be potentially trained using data across distributed data centres or mobile devices sensors in different water utilities pets have been extensively studied in the computer science and machine learning research communities in particular with a huge surge in fundamental research however their application to the water sector at scale requires further research amongst many pets federated learning has received growing interests as it helps to protect data generated on a device or a water utility by training a deep learning model locally and sharing model updates such as gradient data instead of raw data federated learning has been deployed by many big technology companies so they can play a critical role in supporting privacy sensitive applications in the water sector where the training data are distributed at the edge li et al 2020 use of synthetic data is an emerging approach to significantly accelerate the development of deep learning models this approach can make use of the high fidelity models that have been invested in the water sector in the last decades to generate large data sets for deep learning training amongst other advantages it can effectively reduce data privacy risks and increase the size of training data sets as reviewed in section 3 many studies relied on synthetic data generated by physically based uws models for deep learning training gan can produce new both structured and unstructured data sets that resemble the training data set with similar data structures and spatiotemporal dependencies thus represents an important research area for wide adoption of deep learning technologies in data limited situations 4 2 algorithmic development and learning system design designing an appropriate algorithm to a given problem is a key challenge in the development of deep learning models and this will encourage their application to real world water problems some choices e g supervised or unsupervised regression or classification are trivial and straightforward when the real world water problem is clearly formulated and the training data e g time series or image data are identified however in many cases it is a difficult task to choose a proper method given a myriad of deep learning algorithms available for example cnns lstms gans and hybrid algorithms have all been used for contamination detection section 3 1 3 even when the algorithm is chosen the next challenge results from determining its architecture to achieve the best performance for example amongst many other factors the input data format 1d or 2d the number of convolution layers and the size of the filters need to be determined for a cnn before it can be trained with the data the network architecture is normally designed and tested manually which is a time consuming and error prone process however this problem referred to as a network architecture search nas problem can be solved using optimisation algorithms nas is a subfield of automated machine learning which aims to automate the task of applying machine learning to real world problems covering the entire process from the raw data to model deployment previous research has shown that nas approaches outperform manually designed network architectures on many tasks such as computer vision however applications in water management are limited with a few studies such as design of cnns for algal classification in river catchments park et al 2019 further the capacity of nas in designing a hybrid network e g cnn lstm needs to be investigated for complex water problems end to end learning is enabled by deep learning to train a single learning model for complex problems which normally consist of a sequence of tasks that are solved by learning models separately end to end learning allows a single model to produce the required outputs directly from inputs without deep knowledge of the specific intermediate tasks one example is sewer condition assessment which normally involves the following tasks 1 image pre processing to remove noise and improve the image quality 2 image segmentation to detect pipe components and pipe defects 3 feature extraction using feature descriptors such as histograms of orientated gradients scale invariant feature transform or gist 4 defect classification according to different types of defect and 5 condition assessment to determine defect severity and grading each of the tasks can be conducted using a range of machine learning models with end to end learning however a single possibly complex model can be trained for sewer condition assessment using raw images this learning approach thrives on a very large training data set to achieve a certain accuracy which is a key factor limiting its application to solving real world problems development of small data based deep learning approaches is essential to advance the application of deep learning in the water sector though data are being collected at an unprecedented speed in the sector big data are in many cases still not available for urban water infrastructure systems makropoulos and savic 2019 especially compared with other sectors such as finance and retail the superior performance of deep learning approaches normally relies on large amounts of training data however new approaches should be developed for deep learning models with small data first more efforts are needed to investigate how to iteratively improve the quality of existing data in order to improve the performance of a fixed ai model this is a data centric ai approach promoted by ng 2022 which plays a key role in the development of ai products in industry second transfer learning is an approach to exploit deep learning models that are trained using external data from another task beyond the available data on the current task but it has received less attention in urban water applications and should be further studied to leverage the benefits of the recent ai advances third incorporating domain knowledge into deep learning models is another approach to reduce the need for large datasets in order to boost accuracy domain knowledge based deep learning has been applied to fault diagnosis of pipelines feng et al 2021 and medical image analysis xie et al 2021 in uws design problems domain knowledge e g physical laws has been demonstrated to significantly improve the optimisation efficiency liu et al 2020 however research is required for real world deep learning applications though the potential of incorporating domain knowledge into deep learning for image analysis tasks has been demonstrated using different approaches such as fusing hand crafted features into deep learning at the input feature and decision levels and attention mechanism designed to represent radiologists knowledge xie et al 2021 4 3 explainability ai explainability has drawn increasing attention as ai technologies are increasingly used in our society many machine learning in particular deep learning models are used as black boxes which can provide accurate predictions once trained but it is difficult to explain how these predictions are generated or what features are important in making such a prediction explainability is a key principle or embedded in other principles such as transparency fairness and accountability in many ai development frameworks adopted by companies and governments for building trustworthy ai systems the royal society 2019 thus it is discussed below it is widely recognised that there is a trade off between performance and explainability in ai models for example linear regression has high explainability but suffers from low performance and deep learning suffers from low explainability but has high performance the trade off should be explicitly explored by ai system developers and made clear to users aiming at achieving a good balance between performance and explainability compared to conventional machine learning algorithms developing explainable deep learning has unique difficulties arising from samek et al 2021 1 multi scale and distributed nature of network representations 2 instability from the high depth of networks 3 searching a reference data point on which to base the explanation 4 evaluation of explainability which allows for comparisons of ai methods and solutions a diversity of approaches have been developed to interpret deep learning at the global and local levels in the literature but need to be tested on uws applications local explainability aims to understand what input features contribute positively or negatively to each decision or sample while global explainability focuses on making the entire process of model reasoning transparent and understandable contributing to model validation and knowledge discovery often developers and users need different levels of explainability for example users need local approaches to understand how a specific decision is made from the data while developers might need global approaches to understand how an ai system works the royal society 2019 the most influential inputs or features in determining an output can be identified through perturbation masking or removing different parts of inputs to analyse how the output changes these approaches provide a local level of explainability effects interpretable models e g linear regression can be developed to approximate a deep learning model locally and globally for explanations a popular method is called local interpretable model agnostic explanations lime for text and image classification problems another method shap shapley additive explanations was applied to identify the most important environmental factors and their interactions for beach closure l l li et al 2022 the need for explainable ai varies in different domains many uws applications table 1 in the water sector are rather different from those in some sectors such as healthcare and justice where the decision of ai systems has a big impact on people for example the outcome of deep learning based leakage detection systems has no direct consequences on customers from false positive predictions and they can still be deployed without giving rise to concerns about explainability in particular when their accuracy has been well validated in many uws planning and management applications deep learning systems are not used for automated decision making instead their predictions are fed into a complex human decision making process in the example of leakage detection the detection results can be verified by experienced operators or collecting real time data using mobile loggers and then used to inform network maintenance investment decision making from a wider perspective however increasing the explainability of machine learning systems is desirable for developing better ai models and applications in the water sector due to 1 explainability can help us extrapolate an machine learning system s behaviour to situations in which it has not been explicitly tested the royal society 2017 and identify situations in which it may fail and 2 explainability should be developed in a wider context of ai principles however stakeholder engagement should be used to define what form of explainability is useful for uws applications 4 4 multi agent systems a multi agent system consists of multiple intelligent agents which interact in a shared environment to achieve common or conflicting goals an agent can be a software component robot or person each agent typically has its own observations of the environment actions and goals but critically it interacts with other agents through its actions or changes to the shared environment the agents can be cooperative competitive or mixed multi agent systems can be used to tackle dynamic interactions between different components of the uws system and the environment which become important with increasing system complexity and uncertainty agent based models have been widely applied to river basin and hydrological systems with a goal to understand the collective behaviours of multiple agents and develop land and water management options yang et al 2009 however there are few applications of multi agent systems in the uws focusing on designing agents and solving a technological problem potential applications are discussed below co operative multi agent systems are needed for autonomous decision making of optimal planning and operation problems in particular multi agent systems can be combined with the latest drl technology to develop an autonomous decision making framework that can generate optimal actions in response to a dynamic environment one example is the development of a multi agent drl approach to simultaneously optimise do and chemical dosage in a wwtp chen et al 2021 similarly this framework could be applied to control of storage tanks and suds measures e g retention detention ponds in the sewer system control of water tanks and pumps in the water distribution system or co operation of multiple drones in flood emergency operations these system components represented by multi agents can autonomously act to achieve the objectives defined in the example of pump operations an agent can be designed to control pumps in one part of the water network to meet peak demands by keeping high pressure and another agent can be designed to control pumps in an adjacent part of the water network to maintain low pressure for leakage management the two agents need to co operate with each other to meet conflicting operation objectives in the water network through effective handling of dynamic environments in doing so the application of multi agent systems could build a more decentralized highly efficient uws system in addition agents representing various stakeholders such as landowners urban planners and water users can negotiate their interest in the uws planning and management human machine interactions can be a key research area in the field of multi agent systems and they could be useful in real time operation and disaster recovery of a complex uws for example in the case of emergency operation in the aftermath of flooding the behaviour of human agents should be incorporated in assessing the effectiveness of rescue and recovery operations by other agents such as unmanned aerial vehicles strategic planning and optimal design problems are extremely challenging with a large scale of problem domain a large number of stakeholders a wide range of deep uncertainties and interactions with the environment thus human machine interactions can be key to tackle these problems as in multi objective optimisation problems tang et al 2020 4 5 digital twins and autonomous systems the concept of digital twins has generated great interest and momentum in the water sector though sharing many similar characteristics a digital twin is different from a traditional model which often operates in isolation from the physical world amongst many definitions of digital twin e g makropoulos and savic 2019 therrien et al 2020 ibm defines it as a virtual representation of a physical system across its lifecycle using real time data to enable understanding learning and reasoning though there is no consensus on the form of a digital twin it should have the following key features 1 data driven coupling of mathematical models i e physically based machine learning or hybrid with the physical uws that they represent 2 integrated with real time data streams from sensor networks so as to represent the true state of the current physical system 3 able to analyse what if scenarios and provide predictions of the future state 4 closing the loop from the digital twin to the physical system through design maintenance and operation strategies derived from the digital twin and 5 continuously updated with data from the physical world and used in near real time simulations for improved system performance and services the development of digital twins will be transformational in how we interact with manage and control the physical system to date the machine learning component is largely missing in the development of digital twins in the water sector to the best of our knowledge all the reported examples of digital twins were based on physically based models bartos and kerkez 2021 garrido baserba et al 2020 pesantez et al 2022 valverde pérez et al 2021 though a few used machine learning to enhance the performance of hydraulic models such as estimation of the operating speed of pumps bonilla et al 2022 or the influent to the wwtp valverde pérez et al 2021 the deep learning applications reviewed in section 3 can potentially be a key part of digital twins enabling the uws become an autonomous system through automated operation machine learning is a powerful technology to not only help improve our understanding of physical systems but also provide solutions to improve system performance the development of explainable ai can further provide an insight into system processes physics guided machine learning is a new research direction that leverages the knowledge on the system e g physical constraints or process based theories to develop more accurate generalizable machine learning models and it has found many applications in hydrology nearing et al 2021 and water quality varadharajan et al 2022 and is potentially useful to develop digital twins of uwss in the development of digital twins we envision much of the future advance regarding deep learning application will come from the development of systems that combine cnns and lstm networks to understand and predict system behaviours and then use drl to decide where to search for optimal interventions once realised this will significantly empower the digital twin towards achieving high intelligence and autonomy however this advance is going to be hard won requiring a great deal of concerted and sustained fundamental research and development in all five challenges to fully materialize the promise of digital twins 5 conclusions deep learning has been widely recognised as a potentially disruptive technology in the age of industry 4 0 and has already transformed many sectors a critical review on the role of deep learning in urban water management has found the following key points 1 deep learning has showed great potential in urban water management relating to five key application areas including anomaly detection system prediction asset assessment system operation and planning and maintenance however no attempts have been made to solve strategic planning optimal maintenance and intervention development problems 2 the application of deep learning methods in the water sector is still at an early stage as most studies used benchmark networks synthetic data laboratory based or pilot systems to test the performance of deep learning methods it lacks reporting of deployed applications with measurable benefits or lessons learned from an innovative use of deep learning technology 3 deep learning application to different problems has advanced to different stages of maturity on the gartner hype cycle curve but none has reached the stage of industrial application sewer defect detection and leakage detection are believed to be more advanced than other applications significant research efforts are required in the development of deep learning methods to fill knowledge gaps in understanding water processes and improve system performance before they can gain wider adoption in the water sector 4 further research on the five challenges i e data privacy and cybersecurity algorithmic development explainability and trustworthiness multi agent systems and digital twin is recommended for shaping urban water management fuelled by deep learning technology the great promise of deep learning lies in its empowerment of digital twins towards high intelligence and autonomy of uwss which we expect will be materialised through the development of deep learning systems that combine cnns and lstm networks to understand and predict system behaviours and then use deep reinforcement learning to decide where to search for optimal interventions we hope this review will spark thoughts and actions on future research and applications that harness the power of deep learning to help the digitalisation of

15549,deep learning techniques and algorithms are emerging as a disruptive technology with the potential to transform global economies environments and societies they have been applied to planning and management problems of urban water systems in general however there is lack of a systematic review of the current state of deep learning applications and an examination of potential directions where deep learning can contribute to solving urban water challenges here we provide such a review covering water demand forecasting leakage and contamination detection sewer defect assessment wastewater system state prediction asset monitoring and urban flooding we find that the application of deep learning techniques is still at an early stage as most studies used benchmark networks synthetic data laboratory or pilot systems to test the performance of deep learning methods with no practical adoption reported leakage detection is perhaps at the forefront of receiving practical implementation into day to day operation and management of urban water systems compared with other problems reviewed five research challenges i e data privacy algorithmic development explainability and trustworthiness multi agent systems and digital twins are identified as key areas to advance the application and implementation of deep learning in urban water management future research and application of deep learning systems are expected to drive urban water systems towards high intelligence and autonomy we hope this review will inspire research and development that can harness the power of deep learning to help achieve sustainable water management and digitalise the water sector across the world graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords artificial intelligence data analytics deep learning digital twin water management data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction computer simulations have been playing an increasingly significant role in water management since they were pioneered for the planning and design of water resources systems in the harvard water programme in 1955 reuss 2003 physically based models have been developed over many years to represent the urban water system uws at varying levels of complexity and widely used to support its planning operation and management e g iwa 2019 however the advance of physically based models has now essentially stalled due to the challenges in 1 the complexity of uwss and their interactions with other systems such as ecosystems and climate systems particularly in capturing human perceptions behaviours and cascaded impacts 2 the difficulty in determining modelling assumptions various processes and model structures and calibrating a large number of model parameters which can lead to the equifinality problem 3 data scarcity and uncertainty for high resolution modelling 4 intensive computing power required by real time simulation and optimisation and 5 human resources and skills required by model development and maintenance which makes it difficult to transfer from one uws to another on the other hand machine learning which is a subset of artificial intelligence ai allows systems to learn directly from data examples and experience without pre defined rules and is being recognised as a potentially disruptive technology to transform global economies environments and societies the royal society 2017 this is happening against the backdrop of transformations required to address pressing challenges including climate change biodiversity loss and the covid 19 pandemic butler et al 2016 machine learning will undoubtedly play a key role in the transformation of the scientific discipline and practice in the water sector iwa 2019 and help tackle water challenges such as resource efficiency water supply water pollution flooding and drought contributing to achieving the water related united nations sustainable development goals mehmood et al 2020 vinuesa et al 2020 deep learning a subset of machine learning is regarded as one of driving forces for recent breakthroughs in ai deep learning typically uses large multi layer artificial neural networks anns to process large raw data sets thus also termed as deep networks conventional machine learning technologies such as multi layer perceptron mlp neural networks are limited in their ability to process raw data and need domain expertise for data processing before learning deep learning helps to solve this problem and enables automatic feature extraction using multiple levels of representations from raw data to more abstract levels lecun et al 2015 popular deep learning algorithms include convolutional neural networks cnns long short term memory lstm autoencoders graph neural networks gnns and deep reinforcement learning drl these deep learning algorithms have had great success in many areas such as image recognition and have already been applied across a range of industry sectors such as healthcare and finance in the water sector the power of deep learning is increasingly recognised with research publications case studies and applications growing at a rapid speed shen 2018 makropoulos and savic 2019 this is therefore a good point in time to examine the current application of deep learning techniques in urban water management and provide a perspective of deep learning research in advancing water engineering and boosting practical application of dl techniques to real world water problems this paper aims to provide a critical review of the role of deep learning in the planning and management of uwss we will examine the progress of deep learning research and application in key urban water challenges and discuss potential directions where advances in deep learning research are needed to boost the development of intelligent uwss and the digitalisation process in the water sector the remaining paper is organised as below section 2 introduces the advances in deep learning in comparison to conventional machine learning section 3 reviews deep learning application to urban water management including demand prediction leakage detection contamination detection sewer defect and blockage assessment wastewater system prediction urban flooding asset monitoring and system control section 4 presents future research challenges and conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 advances in deep learning historically ai has been through several highs and lows but recently deep learning is driving the development and application of ai across various industries compared to conventional machine learning deep learning has advanced in many aspects as discussed below first it enables the automatic extraction of features from raw data through multiple levels of representation learning starting from raw data to higher more abstract levels lecun et al 2015 this eliminates the requirement of feature engineering and domain knowledge to extract features from raw data before they are fed into machine learning algorithms further this improves the learning capacity through amplification of important patterns and suppression of irrelevant variations in the input data together with the exponential advantage in representing complex non linear functions from stacking a large number of hidden layers in deep networks lecun et al 2015 shen 2018 second the wide adoption of the rectified linear unit activation function which is simply a half wave rectifier f x max x 0 and its variations brings the following advantages goodfellow et al 2016 1 fast training of deep networks due to computation savings from its derivatives which is 1 for a positive input otherwise 0 and error terms 2 solving the vanishing gradient problem due to its higher gradients and linearity 3 allowing the activation of hidden layers to output true zero values for negative inputs which leads to sparse representation a desirable property in representation learning while the sigmoid activation function can only learn to approximate a zero output e g a value very close to zero but not a true zero value third the development of the stochastic gradient descent method has made the training of deep networks very efficient especially for large datasets as it randomly selects a small subset called a mini batch from the training dataset each time and this process is repeated until the training is converged the stochastic gradient descent method has been improved with many extensions such as adam kingma and ba 2015 which has gained popularity for deep learning applications further the network training has been made more computationally efficient and effective with a range of techniques including improved architectures unsupervised pre training weights sharing model compression and distillation and regularization methods e g dropout lecun et al 2015 shen 2018 finally the success of deep learning is also built on the advances in hardware accelerators such as graphics processing units gpu and the availability of large datasets data parallelization is a commonly used gpu strategy for accelerating deep learning training well aligned with mini batch training in the strategy a copy of the network is stored and trained on its own mini batch of data in each gpu and its computed gradients and losses are then transferred to the shared processor e g cpu for aggregation before being rebroadcast to gpus for parameter updates this strategy substantially accelerates the training of deep networks for large datasets and improves the learning capacity of deep networks architectures of several popular deep learning algorithms including autoencoders lstms cnns drl and gnns and their key features are shown in fig 1 together with the conventional multi layer perceptron ann more information about these architectures is provided in supplementary material together with a brief introduction of machine learning and mlp neural networks other networks such as generative adversarial networks gan and transformers vaswani et al 2017 are discussed in the literature xu and liang 2021 goodfellow et al 2016 3 deep learning applications deep learning has been used in a wide range of application areas in urban water management predominantly covering anomaly detection system prediction asset assessment system operation and planning and maintenance fig 2 anomaly detection is a type of diagnostic analytics which aims to identify various failure events e g leakages contamination events blockages and cyber attacks system prediction and asset assessment provide an understanding of the current and future states of the uws being hydraulic or asset conditions system operation planning and maintenance are optimisation problems aiming to identify the best solutions given specific constraints deep learning can play a role in all the key issues in the life cycle of the uws with a diverse range of architectures for different problems at present however there are few well tested deep learning algorithms or products readily available for solving uws problems a number of challenges related to data and algorithmic development hinder the development and implementation of deep learning approaches in the water sector fig 2 the latest applications are reviewed and categorised in detail in the following sections water supply and distribution systems section 3 1 urban wastewater systems section 3 2 urban flooding section 3 3 and cyber security and asset monitoring section 3 4 reinforcement learning as an emerging approach for prescriptive analytics has just started to receive applications in system control and operation hence it is reviewed in section 3 5 gaps in industrial application are discussed in section 3 6 table 1 provides a summary of the latest developments of the key problems reviewed covering the aspects of popular algorithms data requirements case studies and advantages most problems are related to classification anomaly detection and regression tasks using images or time series data cnns lstms and their hybrids are amongst the most popular models for solving these problems 3 1 water supply and distribution systems 3 1 1 demand forecasting demand forecasting is a typical time series forecasting problem which is normally regarded as a supervised learning problem thus lstm models have been predominantly used to learn the time dependence in historical data lstm models are able to predict hourly or sub hourly demands by capturing the features from the previous time step demands without considering other weather and demographic factors a gated recurrent unit gru based rnn was able to achieve more accurate and reliable water demand predictions with 15 min and 24 h forecast horizons than traditional machine learning models guo et al 2018 the performance of lstm models in high temporal resolution i e 15 mins and 1 h demand predictions was further confirmed by mu et al 2020 through comparisons with autoregressive integrated moving average arima support vector machine svm and random forest models in particularly for handling demand spikes lstms are able to predict the daily water demand profile at a 1 h time step in an online learning setting with a few days learning from scratch so they can be used to generate demand predictions for optimising the next day pump operation which is particularly useful for small water suppliers with limited historical data kühnert et al 2021 with the increasing adoption of smart water meters lstms can be used to provide reliable water demand predictions based on water consumption data and thus offer opportunities for water utilities to optimise resources and operations nasser et al 2020 showed that the lstm outperformed svms and random forest models using aggregated 10 minute smart metre data of 2 20 households from a pilot study in cairo however it fails to predict the peak demands recent studies showed that hybrid deep learning models achieve high performance in daily water demand predictions when weather and demographic factors are considered du et al 2021 developed a hybrid lstm model for daily water demand forecasting which combines two lstms with discrete wavelet transformation and principal component analysis to pre process the raw data one lstm uses de noised demand sequence to predict the baseline trend and the other lstm uses the demand residuals to predict the artificial noise while the principal components of weather and holiday factors are also used as input to both networks hu et al 2019 applied the cnn to extract the features of the previous five day water consumption data and the daily maximum temperature before they are passed to the bi directional lstm model for daily water demand prediction and the hybrid cnn lstm model achieved higher predictive accuracy than lstm bi lstm and cnn data preprocessing techniques such as time series signal decomposition can facilitate feature extraction and thus improve the predictive accuracy of gru based models hu et al 2021 in summary previous research shows the lstm and its hybrid algorithms are the most popular deep learning approach for water demand forecasting and they outperform traditional machine learning methods due to the capacity in capturing temporal dependence however applications are limited to short term demand forecasting with the forecast time step of less than one day 3 1 2 leakage detection and localisation deep learning approaches for leakage detection and localisation can be roughly grouped into two categories classification and prediction based approaches the classification approach trains deep learning models on labelled data i e pressure flow acoustic and vibration signals to identify normal and abnormal events a major disadvantage of this approach is the effort in collecting and labelling a large amount of data though hydraulic models can be used to generate synthetic data for training e g javadiha et al 2019 zhou et al 2019b the prediction based approach generally uses deep learning models to predict the system states pressure or flow and then classify the residuals between predicted and measured state values using a threshold in the literature cnns are the predominant deep learning approach to leakage detection and localisation and in most studies they are trained using labelled data to classify normal and abnormal events there are a few prediction based deep learning approaches in the literature and one example used a lstm to predict water demand which achieved a high detection accuracy high true positive rate and low false positive rate wang et al 2020 the following review will focus on the cnns based classification approach organised by data sources i e pressure flow data acoustic vibration and their input format cnns have been trained on pressure data for multi point leakage detection six cnn models were trained by fang et al 2019 using pressure data which were collected from a water distribution system wds in a laboratory platform and manually labelled for leakage events the best cnn model achieved an accuracy of 97 33 and 92 11 when 21 and 8 pressure sensors were used respectively it was observed that accuracy decreases for multi leak events from 96 43 for single point leakage to 91 56 for three point leakage the high accuracies achieved are partially due to the high number of sensors used between 8 and 21 sensors for a network of 400 m which is impractical for real world networks the idea of using hydraulic models to generate pressure data with a large number of leak events for training was proposed by zhou et al 2019b hydraulic models have been used for synthetic data generation before however data were generated under normal conditions with no or limited number of leakage scenarios zhou et al 2019b developed a fully linear densenet to effectively extract leakage features in the wds so that leaks could be localised to the pipe level once trained off line using a large number of leakage signals e g 200 leak events per pipe the model was used online to locate leaks using real time pressure data from in situ or mobile loggers results from two wdss show that the model is able to accurately identify the pipe where leaks occur similarly synthetic leakage data were used for cnn training javadiha et al 2019 and autoencoder training fan et al 2021 however they produced pressure residual maps from the differences between pressure measurements provided by sensors and pressure estimates obtained from a hydraulic network model and then converted the maps to 2d images to train cnns for leakage localisation the pressure residual maps characterise the impact of all possible leak localizations but might be affected by uncertainties in hydraulic modelling indeed the impacts of hydraulic model uncertainties such as random demands and leak sizes were considered when synthetic data are used for leakage localisation javadiha et al 2019 zhou et al 2019b and leakage detection fan et al 2021 acoustic and vibration signals which are generated by leaks from pressure changes by cracks when elastic waves are propagated through the pipe can be learnt by cnns kang et al 2018 nam et al 2021 or autoencoders cody et al 2020 to classify normal or abnormal events kang et al 2018 trained and tested a one dimensional cnn on a dataset consisting of 1580 normal and 660 abnormal 10 second signals pairs collected from six accelerometer sensors in a looped wds in seoul the dataset was segmented into 1 second signals and labelled for learning the detection accuracy was improved by data preprocessing through a general denoising method and a bandpass filter for extraction of leak frequency bands or by integrating a svm into the cnn to provide a diverse feature classification in the study of shukla and piratla 2020 a cnn model adapted from a pre trained alexnet network was used to detect leaks on polyvinyl chloride pvc pipelines using scalogram images which are the wavelet transformation of raw acceleration signals without any preprocessing such as noise reduction or application of filters from an experimental pipeline test bed and it can predict leakage sizes and locations in addition to leakage detection an autoencoder was applied by cody et al 2020 based on spectrograms of acoustic data which uses a 2d cnn for preprocessing of the spectrograms followed by a variational autoencoder layer to reach the latent layer the autoencoder was tested using data collected from a laboratory test bed that was connected to a municipal water system via a service line thus ensuring realistic baseline variation and it achieved an accuracy of 97 2 for detecting a 0 25 l s leak in addition to leakage detection the autoencoder model has been used to detect the anomalies of the internal surface of water pipelines using cctv video jiao et al 2021 the input data format for cnns has been studied in the literature as it is closely related to feature extraction and thus affects the detection accuracy as cnns are well suited for processing 2d images previous research attempted to convert one dimension pressure signals to 2d images for leakage detection and localisation javadiha et al 2019 m zhou et al 2019a or convert acoustic signals to 2d images cody et al 2020 however this process may lead to the loss of some useful information and increase in computational costs zhou et al 2021 thus one dimensional cnns 1d cnns are now often employed to directly process original 1d time series signals for leakage detection and localisation for example 1d cnns were used extract features directly from vibration signals kang et al 2018 and pressure data fang et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 however the raw signals i e acoustic data could be transformed through different techniques such as fast fourier transform fft wavelet transforms and time domain features before being input to a 1d cnn for training rahimi et al 2020 showed that converting the acoustic signal to a 1d image through fft can effectively help detect leakage in plastic and composite water tanks and thus significantly improve the performance of cnns in this direction a new advance is the development of a novel time frequency cnn by guo et al 2021a which can capture the leakage spectrograms through three different resolutions i e high frequency high time and transitional time frequency resolutions attempts to apply cnns to other aspects of leakage detection have been made such as transfer learning to fine tune cnns building on the knowledge from a pre trained cnn model such as alexnet shukla and piratla 2020 zhou et al 2021 and leakage zone identification using spatial clustering and cnns hu et al 2021b further efforts have been made to use satellite images for leakage detection by training a cnn model however such approaches do not support real time continuous monitoring and are more suitable for large leaks and tend to result in high rates of false alarms owing to the resolution of the satellite images shukla and piratla 2020 in summary cnns are the only widely used deep learning method for leakage detection using either flow pressure data or acoustic vibration data and the focus has been on how to best capture anomalous signals by improving training data size or data format transformation however other deep learning algorithms such as lstm gan and gnn should be explored to capture spatial and temporal relationships from multi source and multi site data 3 1 3 contamination and water quality one challenge in anomaly detection in high volume data is the unbalanced data problem due to the typical low frequency of anomalous events and highly variable and dynamic sensor data this was tackled in the water quality anomaly detection competition series organised at the genetic and evolutionary computation conference gecco where the real world drinking water quality dataset used is extremely imbalanced with the ratio of abnormal events being 1 452 only when tested on this dataset a balanced lstm model which includes a fixed rate of 10 positive samples in each batch of training data was shown to achieve a higher f1 score a combined measure of the model s precision and recall of 0 7819 than the standard lstm and other machine learning methods qian et al 2020 using the same data set muharemi et al 2019 also showed that the lstm and a deep network with three hidden layers of six neurons each have a high performance with an f score of 0 9 outperforming traditional machine learning methods except svm when all methods were trained using time series cross validation however all the methods generalized badly to a new data set chen et al 2018a used a 1d cnn consisting of two convolutional two max pooling layers and two fully connected layers each with 128 neurons to extract the features in raw water quality data before they are fed into a bi directional lstm and they claimed the cnn lstm approach was suitable for water quality detection problems but no performance results were provided in general deep learning methods outperform traditional machine learning methods in terms of feature learning accuracy and fewer false positive rates though a fair comparison between different studies is difficult due to different datasets models and parameters employed dogo et al 2019 the broad range of possible anomaly types poses another challenge in water quality anomaly detection water quality data from in situ sensors are likely to encounter the following common anomalies with decreasing priority large sudden spike low variability persistent values constant off set sudden shift data oscillation drift and small sudden spike leigh et al 2019 rodriguez perez et al 2020 applied lstms to classify different types of river water quality anomalies considering two parameters i e turbidity and conductivity separately and they found that sudden spikes and small sudden spikes are more likely to be detected when the lstm model is trained using normal water quality data whereas long term data drift is more likely to be detected when anomalous data are included in the training dataset they concluded that the lstm model considerably minimized false detection rates in comparison with the regression based arima approach though its performance varied for different water quality parameters and monitoring sites water quality anomaly detection has made use of multivariate time series data from water quality sensors this is distinct from leakage detection which normally relies on flow and pressure data or acoustic signals the gecco challenge dataset includes chlorine oxide ph value redox potential electric conductivity turbidity temperature and flow rate so all these parameter data are input into an machine learning model to identify anomaly events directly muharemi et al 2019 however this approach needs labelled data for training in another direction of research machine learning models can be used to predict a water quality parameter value using other parameter data so the residuals between estimated and observed data can be used for outlier classification for each parameter which can then be fused for anomaly event detection arad et al 2013 li et al 2022b to fully exploit complex multivariate correlations gan based approaches have been developed as they can consider the entire variable set concurrently in order to capture the latent spatio temporal interactions amongst the variables it has been shown that gan models are well suited for complex anomaly detection problems and have superior performance over existing unsupervised methods when the generator and discriminator are both represented by a lstm network li et al 2019a gnn based approaches can effectively learn the relationships between multiple sensors and allow users to deduce the root cause of a detected anomaly experiments on two real world sensor datasets show that a novel attention based gnn approach detects anomalies with higher accuracies including precision recall and f1 than baseline approaches including deep autoencoders lstm and gan models deng and hooi 2021 more importantly gnn in particular attention based networks can provide a certain level of interpretability for the detected anomalies as attention weights indicate the importance of the neighbouring nodes sensors in modelling the node s behaviour in summary the availability of open quality data boosted the application of various deep learning methods lstm gan and gnn to contamination detection however their performance needs to be further tested on measured data which represent the multivariate complexity in the real world 3 2 urban wastewater systems 3 2 1 sewer defect and blockage the internal surface condition of sewers is traditionally assessed manually using closed circuit television cctv videos by professional inspectors this process is labour intensive and time consuming in recent years cnns have been widely used for automated sewer defect detection more specifically for the following tasks 1 image classification classifying cctv images according to contained defects 2 object detection identifying the types of defects and their locations 3 semantic segmentation labelling the pixels belonged to a defect image classification kumar et al 2018 trained a series of binary classification cnns each for a single type of defect only to reduce the time required for training a single cnn was set up to classify the frames into multiple defect classes by meijer et al 2019 apart from sewer defects gutierrez mondragon et al 2020 trained a cnn to identify the obstruction level of sewer pipes some popular cnns in the computer vision domain have been tested on sewer defect detection for instance hassan et al 2019 fine tuned alexnet to extract feature maps from sewer frames to tackle the imbalance between the datasets of defective and normal pipes a hierarchical classification structure was used a high level classification that classifies normal and defective pipes followed by a low level classification that classifies defective pipes into specific types of defects xie et al 2019 similarly resnet18 was adopted by li et al 2019b in the hierarchical structure which contains residual learning operations to enhance learning process he et al 2016 chen et al 2018b used a lightweight network called squeezenet for high level classification and inceptionv3 for low level classification due to its relatively high recognition ability various techniques have been considered in cnns to improve efficiency and accuracy for example chen et al 2019 improved a binary classification cnn for sewer defects by introducing a cost sensitive activation layer and cost mean loss kumar et al 2020a leveraged a cnn interpretation technique called class activation mapping to visualize the learnt weights and then guide the adjustments of cnns moreover the text shown in the sewer inspection frames normally includes the pipe property and the driving distance from the starting point which reveals the location of the frames therefore cnns were used to extract the distance and thus determine the location of defective frames moradi et al 2020 object detection prior research aimed to detect not only the types of defects but also the locations of defects in the frames further multiple types of defects may be contained in the same image which is a difficult issue for classification models object detection models can be applied to solve these issues current cnn based approaches can be mainly divided into two groups 1 region based or two stage detection which means that regions of interests need to be first extracted by a separate network 2 one stage detection in which no region is required a two stage detection method called faster r cnn were used by cheng wang 2018 and zhang et al 2018d specifically cheng wang 2018 used the zeiler fergus network as the cnn part for feature extraction while zhang et al 2018d used vgg 16 to extract features in contrast yin et al 2020 used a one stage network called yolov3 for real time automated sewer defect detection kumar et al 2020b carried out a comparison of three methods i e yolov3 faster r cnn and single shot detector and concluded that yolov3 is suitable for onsite detection due to its faster speed while faster r cnn is more suitable for offsite review due to its superior detection accuracy moreover in wang et al 2021a defect tracking was proposed based on the detection results of a faster r cnn to facilitate the counting of the number of defects across consecutive video frames semantic segmentation semantic segmentation models can annotate each pixel of detected objects in the images kunzel et al 2018 applied a two data stream cnn named full resolution residual network frrn to unrolled and stitched cctv frames for automatic detection and classification of defects and structural elements in sewer pipes pan et al 2020 segmented sewer defects by adding feature reuse and attention mechanism blocks in cnn based u net wang cheng 2020 integrated a deep cnn with dilated convolution called dilaseg with a recurrent neural network rnn formulated from dense conditional random field crf where dilaseg works for feature map extraction and crf formulated rnn is responsible for resolving the local ambiguities furthermore sewer condition assessment was proposed by wang et al 2021b to evaluate the severity of operation and maintenance defects based on semantic segmentation results in summary the superpower of cnn based algorithms in image processing has been leveraged for sewer defect detection with yolo and faster r cnn showing a clear advantage over other deep learning and traditional machine learning methods however only a few types of defects were considered in most studies so future work should investigate more defect types aiming to provide a condition assessment for sewers 3 2 2 system state prediction recent research showed that gru and lstm models have a better performance than traditional anns in predicting cso water depth using monitored water depth and rainfall data in a real world case study the deep learning models improve the generalisation for multi site cso prediction by leveraging spatio correlations across multiple sites in addition to making use of temporal trends at individual sites zhang et al 2018a sewer flow and water depth are commonly predicted based on rainfall data and observed flow and water depth data at previous time steps in the case of predicting cso water levels palmitessa et al 2021 investigated the predictive accuracy of lstm networks in scenarios of limited or missing antecedent observations and they found that lstm networks were capable of compensating for the missing observed data with the other input data e g time of the day and rainfall intensity because infiltration process is not negligible use of groundwater level data as an additional input can improve the performance of lstms in predicting the flow at various sites of a sewer system sufi karimi et al 2019 application of predicted system behaviours to operation practices have been demonstrated in the literature the high predictive capability of lstms in sewer flow modelling was used for improving in sewer storage control in order to reduce overflow at the wwtp zhang et al 2018b and for the operation of the wwtp zhang et al 2018c dairi et al 2019 developed a hybrid rnn rbm method to predict multivariate water quality influent time series which was then used for anomaly detection this approach can help monitor and detect abnormal influent conditions that can affect the operation of wwtps thus improving operational resilience amongst six gru and lstm variants the lstm model shows an overall high accuracy in predicting the influent flow influent temperature influent biochemical oxygen demand bod effluent chloride effluent bod and power consumption in a wwtp cheng et al 2020 the cod mass flow in the wwtp was predicted based on 1 minute measured data for temperature ph nh3 n sewage inflow and influent cod with a hybrid cnn lstm model which can support the development of feedforward control systems for aeration and chemical dosing wang et al 2019 similar to demand prediction rnn and lstm models have been predominantly used for prediction of the key state variables of urban wastewater systems including water quality flow and water level at various components and csos in both the sewer system and the wwtp however more work is needed to identify the complex relationships between variables in both wastewater system and demand prediction 3 3 urban flooding 3 3 1 data processing for hydrodynamic flood modelling the predictive accuracy of hydrodynamic flood models significantly relies on high resolution data e g catchment and weather data however the availability of such data is a main challenge in many cities deep learning can play a key role in processing big data of aerial photography lidar data satellite data and radar weather data to generate high resolution multispectral data for improving urban flood modelling pollard et al 2018 deep learning has gained wide application in remote sensing due to its power in information extraction from raw images the most commonly used models are cnns rnns autoencoders and their hybrids applications include image segmentation land use classification terrain attribute extraction object identification e g building bridges and multi source image fusion however a detailed review of these areas is out of the scope of this review and more information can be found in shen 2018 and other reviews in the field of remote sensing and hydrology processing raw images with deep learning provides high resolution urban catchment data particularly useful for areas with low resolution images the availability of semantic information from cnn based classification enables large scale 3d city reconstruction zhu et al 2017 which could be potentially used for flood damage assessment flood emergency planning and real time flood decision analytics notably remote sensing imagery has been used for disaster assessment during a flood event using deep learning yang and cervone 2019 iqbal et al 2021 deep learning can be applied to provide high resolution weather and flood data where no such data are available cnns have been used to improve the accuracy of rainfall nowcasting at high spatial resolution barrington et al 2019 estimate flood extent using images from unmanned aerial vehicles hashemi beni and gebrehiwot 2021 and monitor water depth using cctv videos de vitry et al 2019 and crowdsourced photos alizadeh and behzadan 2021 accurate representation of rainfall and flood depth at high resolution provides high quality data to calibrate urban flood models 3 3 2 urban flood forecasting in the last several years deep learning has been extensively studied for river flow and flood forecasting and fluvial flood inundation in hydrology kabir et al 2020 xu and liang 2021 xu et al 2020 however it has not received much attention in urban pluvial flood predictions mainly due to the challenge in learning large datasets of high resolution urban catchment features li et al 2021 and lack of measured flood and water infrastructure data flood data in urban areas are generally unavailable compared to the availability of long river flow records such as the large data set of 30 years from several hundred basins nearing et al 2021 a few studies have showed that cnns are capable for urban flood prediction one example is a hybrid model developed by guo et al 2021b to predict the maximum flood depth for rainfall events this hybrid model uses a convolutional autoencoder to process the urban catchment data and a feedforward fully connected neural network which is attached to the latent layer of the autoencoder to process the hyetograph data five terrain surface feature maps including elevation slope aspect curvature and masque are divided into patches to train the cnns the model provided accurate predictions for areas of different characteristics e g flat steep around buildings upstream and downstream when tested on three case studies the autoencoder model was later improved by adding skip connections from encoding blocks to decoding blocks applying average pooling in the encoding part and converting rainfall time series into 9 event characteristics löwe et al 2021 cnns were also tested for the assessment of urban surface water flood risks using catchment data and outperformed traditional machine learning methods such as naïve bayes li et al 2021 in summary deep learning has found more applications in data processing than in flood prediction with most algorithms based on cnns however it is worth investigating other architectures such as hybrid cnn lstm algorithms to improve flood predictive accuracy in the future 3 4 cyber security and asset monitoring water and wastewater infrastructure is considered as one of the main targets for cyberattacks amongst 16 critical infrastructure systems by the us department of homeland security and it is not uncommon to see cybersecurity incidents reported for example 25 cyber security incidents were reported in 2015 alone in the us making the water and wastewater sector the third most targeted sector after manufacturing and energy sectors hassanzadeh et al 2020 thus the security of urban water infrastructure has drawn increasing attention in the practical and research communities deep learning methods including lstm autoencoders and gnn models have enabled significant improvements in cyber attack detection in high dimensional datasets a lstm model was developed to detect cyber attacks in a water treatment system and was trained using data under normal conditions and evaluated using 36 different attack scenarios inoue et al 2017 autoencoders were also tested with 14 attack scenarios considering various components such as pumps tanks and controllers in a benchmark water distribution system i e c town and results showed autoencoders substantially outperform traditional machine learning methods i e xgboost and lightgbm taormina and galelli 2018 erba et al 2020 evaluated different evasion attacks which modify anomalous data to evade deep autoencoder based detectors using two datasets from water treatment test bed systems with various attack scenarios a novel attention based gnn approach was shown to outperform a set of baseline models including lstm autoencoders and hybrid models deng and hooi 2021 tsiami and makropoulos 2021 showed that a convolutional gnn was able to leverage the inherent interdependencies of the scada data for cyber attack detection in water distribution systems and interpret model predictions based on feature interdependencies a deep generative model with variational inference was developed for cyber attacks based on autonomously learnt normal system behaviours from raw observations such as pump pressure and tank water level chandy et al 2019 research and innovation in uws development should be prioritised to mitigate the substantial risks and vulnerabilities that are created from water digitalisation and the uptake of ai technologies in the water sector it is particularly urgent to develop cybersecurity best practice guidelines for uwss as part of critical national infrastructure as explained above deep learning based methods including lstm autoencoders and gnn models could be used to increase cybersecurity and enable significant improvements in cyber attack detection in high dimensional datasets for example adversarial machine learning has been used to fool detection algorithms erba et al 2020 and insight gained could help develop new deep learning detection methods these methods however need to be tested with more cyber attack scenarios from the real world uwss and consider network traffic data taormina et al 2018 in addition to anomaly detection deep learning can be developed as a soft sensor or a surrogate model for water asset monitoring it is common that measurements in water systems are not available due to either no sensors or faults in the cyber system soft sensing has been considered as a solution to replace missing measurements primary measurements with predicted values based on the other measurements secondary measurements available 2d cnn and lstm models were trained using one minute operation data collected from 100 sensors for one year in a water treatment works and their results were combined using multiple linear regression to achieve a significantly higher predictive accuracy measured by root mean square errors than individual cnn and lstm models cao et al 2018 this ensemble model can be used as a soft sensor to predict flow and water level in case of any missing data from the 100 sensors similarly lstm models can also provide accurate predictions for key variables in wastewater treatment plants wwtp cheng et al 2020 the use of deep learning models as a surrogate of hydraulic models was also demonstrated using a deep belief network which is a variant of multi layer perceptron networks with stacked restricted boltzmann machines wu and rahman 2017 a gnn based on k localized spectral filtering was used to re construct the pressures at all nodes from a limited number of nodal pressure measurements and this approach was shown achieving a relative error below 5 on average with an observation ratio of 5 when tested with three benchmark networks hajgató et al 2021 this shows the promise of using gnns as a soft sensor or a surrogate model for pressure monitoring across the entire network in addition to system states gnns were used to fill missing pipe attribute data i e diameters and materials in wastewater networks belghaddar et al 2021 a cnn model was used to monitor the changes of the fat oil grease layer and various hydraulic processes in the pump sump in a wastewater system moreno rodenas et al 2021 and could potentially be used to predict pump sump failure in summary cyber security and asset monitoring have received significantly increasing research efforts with a diverse range of algorithms including lstm autoencoders and gnn models tested however the research questions in these areas are similar to those in leakage contamination and blockage detection and localisation and thus data and experience could be shared 3 5 system control and operation drl has emerged as a new technology for real time control and operation and has received applications in many fields including water resources and hydropower reservoir operation xu et al 2021 however drl has not received much attention in uwss applications are mainly reported in urban drainage systems and wwtps which are introduced below only one application was found in water distribution systems and it tested the dqn based drl for pump control using two benchmark water distribution systems i e anytown and d town hajgató et al 2020 the pump speed was determined considering the system states nodal pressures and pump speed ratios and maximizing a reward which was formulated considering the three objectives including the number of nodes exceeding the required pressure ranges pump efficiency and feed ratio of the pumps they showed that the dqn can achieve comparable results to some commonly used optimisation algorithms 3 5 1 flood control of urban drainage systems drl has been used for flood risk management through developing control strategies of retention or detention ponds mullapudi et al 2020 developed a dqn based drl algorithm for real time non predictive control of a distributed stormwater system with multiple detention ponds which has an objective of achieving desired water levels and flows in the system using the water level and outflows at each control site as the state variables the algorithm was effective for control of individual detention ponds but it was proven challenging for system level control with multiple ponds due to temporal dynamics system interactions and high dimensionality research has shown that flood control of urban drainage systems can be improved through policy based deep learning with incorporation of rainfall forecasts into decision making bowes et al 2021 applied a ddpg actor critic algorithm to flood control of urban drainage systems which operates the valves at the bottom of retention ponds different from dqn based approaches this algorithm can control valves over a continuous action space it was tested on a hypothetical urban catchment which has two sub catchments two retention ponds controlled by valves and a tidally influenced water body the outputs from swmm simulations were used to train the algorithm the system state is represented by the current flood depth and volume at the ponds and downstream nodes the current valve positions the sum of the 24 h rainfall forecast for each subcatchment and the mean value of the 24 h tide forecast the actions that the agent can take at any step are to close or open any valve to any degree the reward is formulated based on how well the agent prevents flooding and maintains certain target pond water depths rl is shown to outperform model predictive control mpc and rule based control strategies by effectively learning to proactively manage pond levels using current and forecast conditions further the ddpg algorithm is shown to be robust when considering uncertainties in input data i e rainfall forecasts and system states i e water level saliba et al 2020 previous research has shown the promise of using drl for automated control of urban drainage systems to reduce flooding however a number of challenges arose from learning real time control rules for complex systems for example the formulation of reward functions to guide system behaviours control of multiple distributed storage tanks handling of multiple objectives use of future forecasts and choice of different drl approaches blumensaat et al 2019 bowes et al 2021 mullapudi et al 2020 3 5 2 wastewater treatment plants rl has been applied to reduce operational costs in wwtps using a wwtp benchmark simulation model 1 gernaey et al 2014 hernández del olmo et al 2016 showed that rl can better control the do set points of a proportional integral pi controller considering the system state variables i e ammonium and do concentrations and save operational costs when compared to manual operation and ammonium based pi controllers q learning based rl was also tested for the control of the advanced oxidation process of phenols using fenton s reagent in a laboratory plant syafiie et al 2011 and for optimising the hydraulic retention time of anaerobic and aerobic reactors pang et al 2019 in a model free rl approach it is important to introduce a shadowing period for rl to learn from human operations before the rl agent is deployed to control the wwtp hernández del olmo et al 2018 showed that an initial shadowing period of 30 days improves dramatically the agent s learning speed and reduces significantly the operational cost though a longer shadowing period can make the learning more effective in addition to the traditional rl a few applications of drl have been made in wwtps a policy based drl was developed for energy consumption reduction through controlling pumps between primary and secondary treatment and it used probabilistic inflow forecasts to minimize energy consumption and reduce the number of alarms for tank level exceeding the limits filipe et al 2019 further a multi agent ddpg approach was applied to control dissolved oxygen and chemical dosage in a wwtp under continuous action and state spaces chen et al 2021 in this approach various reward functions were tested in order to develop sustainable control strategies in summary various policy and value based drl approaches have been applied to system control of uwss though the number of applications is limited and most in urban wastewater systems compared to the other deep learning algorithms however there was lack of comparisons of drl applications with non deep learning methods such as evolutionary optimisation 3 6 real world application the application of deep learning methods to uwss is still at an early stage as most reported studies have used benchmark networks synthetic data and laboratory based or pilot systems real world systems and monitoring data have been used in the literature however they were mainly for model development and demonstration of deep learning potential in comparison to traditional machine learning models the studies reviewed generally aimed to demonstrate improved performances of deep learning in comparison to traditional machine learning models or to develop an improved deep learning architecture through comparing different architecture designs to the best of our knowledge there is no reporting of deployed applications into day to day operation and management of real world uwss with measurable benefits or lessons learned from an innovative use of deep learning technology learning that is no deep learning methods have reached the slope of enlightenment stage on the gartner hype cycle curve fig 3 the water applications reviewed have received varying levels of attention and have advanced to different stages of maturity fig 3 leakage detection is the most popular problem for deep learning research in urban water management which is mainly due to data availability and the drive to reduce leakage and resources i e water and energy consumption world wide recall that various sensors have been deployed in the water industry to collect water demand pressure acoustic and vibration data all of which have been applied to leakage detection leakage detection is perhaps in the stage of trough of disillusionment on the gartner hype cycle curve where deep learning fails to deliver the high expectation but interest in developing new methods and tools continues as demonstrated by the battle of the leakage detection and isolation methods liu et al 2019 it is likely to move to the next stage slope of enlightenment where it will receive wider practical implementation a strategy towards wider industrial implementation may involve demonstrating the reliability of deep learning technologies through pilot studies benchmarking with domain knowledge and other existing methods collecting more field data for performance improvement and developing the next generation of deep learning models this process may be iterative and the slope of enlightenment can be long thus it is key to establish close collaborations between deep learning researchers and water companies before mainstream adoption starts to take off reaching the plateau of productivity sewer defect detection is largely at the same stage on the gartner curve as leakage detection this problem was expected to capitalize on the power of deep learning in image processing lecun et al 2015 however challenges have arisen due to lack of large data sets and the effort required for labelling the complexity of various defects and the difficulty in providing direct support for pipe maintenance investments building on more open access images recently made available haurum and moeslund 2021 table 1 research should focus on how deep learning methods are developed to streamline sewer condition assessments for directly supporting investment decisions on the contrary research on contamination detection though having received much attention is based on simplified case studies and data sets and it needs to make a breakthrough in tackling the complexity of real pollution events before reaching the peak of inflated expectations application of deep learning to asset monitoring has received high expectations as part of the recent development of predictive maintenance predictive maintenance seeks to maximize the value of assets throughout their lifecycle building on predicted system states which are normally learnt from large amounts of data compared with other systems such as manufacturing systems where the benefit of predictive maintenance has been demonstrated uwss are more complex with a large number of components and state variables affected by highly uncertain environments but generally with less data for deep learning training the deep learning algorithms developed in the literature are piecemeal unscalable and lack generalisation for real world uwss amongst system state prediction problems short term demand forecasting has received the most attention and achieved high predictive accuracy but medium and long term forecasting suffers from similar data availability and uncertainty challenges in real world problems flood prediction using ai technology at the river basin and catchment scales was rising rapidly in recent years though its role in hydrology is still debated nearing et al 2021 this was partially driven by efforts from big technology companies such as google nevo et al 2019 however the application of deep learning to urban flooding where only a few studies were reported e g guo et al 2021b li et al 2021 needs more research to tackle flood flashiness and high resolution urban features examples of system operation have showed the benefits of drl technology as discussed in section 3 6 which however have not been fully appreciated by the water research communities drl as the only deep learning algorithm that can provide solutions to operation optimisation problems has been mainly tested in the areas of flood control in the sewer system and wastewater treatment operation further it has received many more applications in urban wastewater systems than water distributions systems as reviewed earlier this is not surprising as optimal operation problems traditionally draw more attention in urban wastewater systems than water distribution systems in addition to optimal operation problems drl can also solve optimal long term planning maintenance and management problems fig 2 such as intervention pathway development sadr et al 2020 where solutions at a time step depend on the solutions chosen at previous time steps however it has received no applications in this area the potential impacts and challenges of drl are discussed in the two future research areas multi agent systems and digital twins in sections 4 4 and 4 5 overall it has been demonstrated that deep learning is able to achieve higher efficiency and accuracy than traditional machine learning models when applied to classification anomaly detection and regression tasks in uwss table 1 however significant research gaps remain in the development of deep learning methods to gain more understanding of the processes systematically improve reliability resilience and sustainability of uwss and ultimately building autonomous uwss butler et al 2016 research advances in the areas identified in section 4 will help bridge the gaps and propel the application of deep learning to industrial implementation 4 future research challenges we believe that in time deep learning will fundamentally transform how uwss will be planned managed and operated in response to environmental and social challenges as has already been achieved in some sectors such as the finance and retail sectors the royal society 2017 at the same time deep learning has started to substantially transform some scientific disciplines such as high energy physics astronomy and computational biology shen 2018 and is already transforming water research as reviewed in section 3 here we discuss five potential research challenges that need to be addressed to advance water engineering and science and boost deep learning powered application to solve real world water problems in the face of environmental change fig 4 illustrates the key research areas in addition to research challenges the industrial application of ai in the water sector is affected by many other challenges such as data silo public policy water regulation culture work force institutional management and wider ai ecosystem garrido baserba et al 2020 iwa 2019 which are not discussed in this review 4 1 data privacy the availability of big data was one of the driving factors that lead to the breakthroughs in deep learning at the same time this technology is bringing challenges and risks that are related to data such as availability quality accessibility security privacy and cyber attack for example the high resolution water consumption data from smart meters can reveal personal privacy and behaviours so how can water companies be willing to open their data for deep learning development while they should recognise privacy invasion and associated risks arising from data sharing in the legal framework for data protection such as the new eu general data protection regulation privacy enhancing technologies pets should be developed and deployed to support effective data sharing and collaborative learning over distributed data pets provide a solution to share data and train ai algorithms without the need of pooling data or sharing raw data this might be particularly suitable for deep learning based approaches which could be potentially trained using data across distributed data centres or mobile devices sensors in different water utilities pets have been extensively studied in the computer science and machine learning research communities in particular with a huge surge in fundamental research however their application to the water sector at scale requires further research amongst many pets federated learning has received growing interests as it helps to protect data generated on a device or a water utility by training a deep learning model locally and sharing model updates such as gradient data instead of raw data federated learning has been deployed by many big technology companies so they can play a critical role in supporting privacy sensitive applications in the water sector where the training data are distributed at the edge li et al 2020 use of synthetic data is an emerging approach to significantly accelerate the development of deep learning models this approach can make use of the high fidelity models that have been invested in the water sector in the last decades to generate large data sets for deep learning training amongst other advantages it can effectively reduce data privacy risks and increase the size of training data sets as reviewed in section 3 many studies relied on synthetic data generated by physically based uws models for deep learning training gan can produce new both structured and unstructured data sets that resemble the training data set with similar data structures and spatiotemporal dependencies thus represents an important research area for wide adoption of deep learning technologies in data limited situations 4 2 algorithmic development and learning system design designing an appropriate algorithm to a given problem is a key challenge in the development of deep learning models and this will encourage their application to real world water problems some choices e g supervised or unsupervised regression or classification are trivial and straightforward when the real world water problem is clearly formulated and the training data e g time series or image data are identified however in many cases it is a difficult task to choose a proper method given a myriad of deep learning algorithms available for example cnns lstms gans and hybrid algorithms have all been used for contamination detection section 3 1 3 even when the algorithm is chosen the next challenge results from determining its architecture to achieve the best performance for example amongst many other factors the input data format 1d or 2d the number of convolution layers and the size of the filters need to be determined for a cnn before it can be trained with the data the network architecture is normally designed and tested manually which is a time consuming and error prone process however this problem referred to as a network architecture search nas problem can be solved using optimisation algorithms nas is a subfield of automated machine learning which aims to automate the task of applying machine learning to real world problems covering the entire process from the raw data to model deployment previous research has shown that nas approaches outperform manually designed network architectures on many tasks such as computer vision however applications in water management are limited with a few studies such as design of cnns for algal classification in river catchments park et al 2019 further the capacity of nas in designing a hybrid network e g cnn lstm needs to be investigated for complex water problems end to end learning is enabled by deep learning to train a single learning model for complex problems which normally consist of a sequence of tasks that are solved by learning models separately end to end learning allows a single model to produce the required outputs directly from inputs without deep knowledge of the specific intermediate tasks one example is sewer condition assessment which normally involves the following tasks 1 image pre processing to remove noise and improve the image quality 2 image segmentation to detect pipe components and pipe defects 3 feature extraction using feature descriptors such as histograms of orientated gradients scale invariant feature transform or gist 4 defect classification according to different types of defect and 5 condition assessment to determine defect severity and grading each of the tasks can be conducted using a range of machine learning models with end to end learning however a single possibly complex model can be trained for sewer condition assessment using raw images this learning approach thrives on a very large training data set to achieve a certain accuracy which is a key factor limiting its application to solving real world problems development of small data based deep learning approaches is essential to advance the application of deep learning in the water sector though data are being collected at an unprecedented speed in the sector big data are in many cases still not available for urban water infrastructure systems makropoulos and savic 2019 especially compared with other sectors such as finance and retail the superior performance of deep learning approaches normally relies on large amounts of training data however new approaches should be developed for deep learning models with small data first more efforts are needed to investigate how to iteratively improve the quality of existing data in order to improve the performance of a fixed ai model this is a data centric ai approach promoted by ng 2022 which plays a key role in the development of ai products in industry second transfer learning is an approach to exploit deep learning models that are trained using external data from another task beyond the available data on the current task but it has received less attention in urban water applications and should be further studied to leverage the benefits of the recent ai advances third incorporating domain knowledge into deep learning models is another approach to reduce the need for large datasets in order to boost accuracy domain knowledge based deep learning has been applied to fault diagnosis of pipelines feng et al 2021 and medical image analysis xie et al 2021 in uws design problems domain knowledge e g physical laws has been demonstrated to significantly improve the optimisation efficiency liu et al 2020 however research is required for real world deep learning applications though the potential of incorporating domain knowledge into deep learning for image analysis tasks has been demonstrated using different approaches such as fusing hand crafted features into deep learning at the input feature and decision levels and attention mechanism designed to represent radiologists knowledge xie et al 2021 4 3 explainability ai explainability has drawn increasing attention as ai technologies are increasingly used in our society many machine learning in particular deep learning models are used as black boxes which can provide accurate predictions once trained but it is difficult to explain how these predictions are generated or what features are important in making such a prediction explainability is a key principle or embedded in other principles such as transparency fairness and accountability in many ai development frameworks adopted by companies and governments for building trustworthy ai systems the royal society 2019 thus it is discussed below it is widely recognised that there is a trade off between performance and explainability in ai models for example linear regression has high explainability but suffers from low performance and deep learning suffers from low explainability but has high performance the trade off should be explicitly explored by ai system developers and made clear to users aiming at achieving a good balance between performance and explainability compared to conventional machine learning algorithms developing explainable deep learning has unique difficulties arising from samek et al 2021 1 multi scale and distributed nature of network representations 2 instability from the high depth of networks 3 searching a reference data point on which to base the explanation 4 evaluation of explainability which allows for comparisons of ai methods and solutions a diversity of approaches have been developed to interpret deep learning at the global and local levels in the literature but need to be tested on uws applications local explainability aims to understand what input features contribute positively or negatively to each decision or sample while global explainability focuses on making the entire process of model reasoning transparent and understandable contributing to model validation and knowledge discovery often developers and users need different levels of explainability for example users need local approaches to understand how a specific decision is made from the data while developers might need global approaches to understand how an ai system works the royal society 2019 the most influential inputs or features in determining an output can be identified through perturbation masking or removing different parts of inputs to analyse how the output changes these approaches provide a local level of explainability effects interpretable models e g linear regression can be developed to approximate a deep learning model locally and globally for explanations a popular method is called local interpretable model agnostic explanations lime for text and image classification problems another method shap shapley additive explanations was applied to identify the most important environmental factors and their interactions for beach closure l l li et al 2022 the need for explainable ai varies in different domains many uws applications table 1 in the water sector are rather different from those in some sectors such as healthcare and justice where the decision of ai systems has a big impact on people for example the outcome of deep learning based leakage detection systems has no direct consequences on customers from false positive predictions and they can still be deployed without giving rise to concerns about explainability in particular when their accuracy has been well validated in many uws planning and management applications deep learning systems are not used for automated decision making instead their predictions are fed into a complex human decision making process in the example of leakage detection the detection results can be verified by experienced operators or collecting real time data using mobile loggers and then used to inform network maintenance investment decision making from a wider perspective however increasing the explainability of machine learning systems is desirable for developing better ai models and applications in the water sector due to 1 explainability can help us extrapolate an machine learning system s behaviour to situations in which it has not been explicitly tested the royal society 2017 and identify situations in which it may fail and 2 explainability should be developed in a wider context of ai principles however stakeholder engagement should be used to define what form of explainability is useful for uws applications 4 4 multi agent systems a multi agent system consists of multiple intelligent agents which interact in a shared environment to achieve common or conflicting goals an agent can be a software component robot or person each agent typically has its own observations of the environment actions and goals but critically it interacts with other agents through its actions or changes to the shared environment the agents can be cooperative competitive or mixed multi agent systems can be used to tackle dynamic interactions between different components of the uws system and the environment which become important with increasing system complexity and uncertainty agent based models have been widely applied to river basin and hydrological systems with a goal to understand the collective behaviours of multiple agents and develop land and water management options yang et al 2009 however there are few applications of multi agent systems in the uws focusing on designing agents and solving a technological problem potential applications are discussed below co operative multi agent systems are needed for autonomous decision making of optimal planning and operation problems in particular multi agent systems can be combined with the latest drl technology to develop an autonomous decision making framework that can generate optimal actions in response to a dynamic environment one example is the development of a multi agent drl approach to simultaneously optimise do and chemical dosage in a wwtp chen et al 2021 similarly this framework could be applied to control of storage tanks and suds measures e g retention detention ponds in the sewer system control of water tanks and pumps in the water distribution system or co operation of multiple drones in flood emergency operations these system components represented by multi agents can autonomously act to achieve the objectives defined in the example of pump operations an agent can be designed to control pumps in one part of the water network to meet peak demands by keeping high pressure and another agent can be designed to control pumps in an adjacent part of the water network to maintain low pressure for leakage management the two agents need to co operate with each other to meet conflicting operation objectives in the water network through effective handling of dynamic environments in doing so the application of multi agent systems could build a more decentralized highly efficient uws system in addition agents representing various stakeholders such as landowners urban planners and water users can negotiate their interest in the uws planning and management human machine interactions can be a key research area in the field of multi agent systems and they could be useful in real time operation and disaster recovery of a complex uws for example in the case of emergency operation in the aftermath of flooding the behaviour of human agents should be incorporated in assessing the effectiveness of rescue and recovery operations by other agents such as unmanned aerial vehicles strategic planning and optimal design problems are extremely challenging with a large scale of problem domain a large number of stakeholders a wide range of deep uncertainties and interactions with the environment thus human machine interactions can be key to tackle these problems as in multi objective optimisation problems tang et al 2020 4 5 digital twins and autonomous systems the concept of digital twins has generated great interest and momentum in the water sector though sharing many similar characteristics a digital twin is different from a traditional model which often operates in isolation from the physical world amongst many definitions of digital twin e g makropoulos and savic 2019 therrien et al 2020 ibm defines it as a virtual representation of a physical system across its lifecycle using real time data to enable understanding learning and reasoning though there is no consensus on the form of a digital twin it should have the following key features 1 data driven coupling of mathematical models i e physically based machine learning or hybrid with the physical uws that they represent 2 integrated with real time data streams from sensor networks so as to represent the true state of the current physical system 3 able to analyse what if scenarios and provide predictions of the future state 4 closing the loop from the digital twin to the physical system through design maintenance and operation strategies derived from the digital twin and 5 continuously updated with data from the physical world and used in near real time simulations for improved system performance and services the development of digital twins will be transformational in how we interact with manage and control the physical system to date the machine learning component is largely missing in the development of digital twins in the water sector to the best of our knowledge all the reported examples of digital twins were based on physically based models bartos and kerkez 2021 garrido baserba et al 2020 pesantez et al 2022 valverde pérez et al 2021 though a few used machine learning to enhance the performance of hydraulic models such as estimation of the operating speed of pumps bonilla et al 2022 or the influent to the wwtp valverde pérez et al 2021 the deep learning applications reviewed in section 3 can potentially be a key part of digital twins enabling the uws become an autonomous system through automated operation machine learning is a powerful technology to not only help improve our understanding of physical systems but also provide solutions to improve system performance the development of explainable ai can further provide an insight into system processes physics guided machine learning is a new research direction that leverages the knowledge on the system e g physical constraints or process based theories to develop more accurate generalizable machine learning models and it has found many applications in hydrology nearing et al 2021 and water quality varadharajan et al 2022 and is potentially useful to develop digital twins of uwss in the development of digital twins we envision much of the future advance regarding deep learning application will come from the development of systems that combine cnns and lstm networks to understand and predict system behaviours and then use drl to decide where to search for optimal interventions once realised this will significantly empower the digital twin towards achieving high intelligence and autonomy however this advance is going to be hard won requiring a great deal of concerted and sustained fundamental research and development in all five challenges to fully materialize the promise of digital twins 5 conclusions deep learning has been widely recognised as a potentially disruptive technology in the age of industry 4 0 and has already transformed many sectors a critical review on the role of deep learning in urban water management has found the following key points 1 deep learning has showed great potential in urban water management relating to five key application areas including anomaly detection system prediction asset assessment system operation and planning and maintenance however no attempts have been made to solve strategic planning optimal maintenance and intervention development problems 2 the application of deep learning methods in the water sector is still at an early stage as most studies used benchmark networks synthetic data laboratory based or pilot systems to test the performance of deep learning methods it lacks reporting of deployed applications with measurable benefits or lessons learned from an innovative use of deep learning technology 3 deep learning application to different problems has advanced to different stages of maturity on the gartner hype cycle curve but none has reached the stage of industrial application sewer defect detection and leakage detection are believed to be more advanced than other applications significant research efforts are required in the development of deep learning methods to fill knowledge gaps in understanding water processes and improve system performance before they can gain wider adoption in the water sector 4 further research on the five challenges i e data privacy and cybersecurity algorithmic development explainability and trustworthiness multi agent systems and digital twin is recommended for shaping urban water management fuelled by deep learning technology the great promise of deep learning lies in its empowerment of digital twins towards high intelligence and autonomy of uwss which we expect will be materialised through the development of deep learning systems that combine cnns and lstm networks to understand and predict system behaviours and then use deep reinforcement learning to decide where to search for optimal interventions we hope this review will spark thoughts and actions on future research and applications that harness the power of deep learning to help the digitalisation of
