15205,with the significant increase in wqi applications worldwide and lack of specific application guidelines accuracy and reliability of wqi models is a major issue it has been reported that wqi models produce significant uncertainties during the various stages of their application including i water quality indicator selection ii sub index si calculation iii water quality indicator weighting and iv aggregation of sub indices to calculate the overall index this research provides a robust statistically sound methodology for assessment of wqi model uncertainties eight wqi models are considered the monte carlo simulation mcs technique was applied to estimate model uncertainty while the gaussian process regression gpr algorithm was utilised to predict uncertainties in the wqi models at each sampling site the sub index functions were found to contribute to considerable uncertainty and hence affect the model reliability they contributed 12 86 and 10 27 of uncertainty for summer and winter applications respectively therefore the selection of sub index function needs to be made with care a low uncertainty of less than 1 was produced by the water quality indicator selection and weighting processes significant statistical differences were found between various aggregation functions the weighted quadratic mean wqm function was found to provide a plausible assessment of water quality of coastal waters at reduced uncertainty levels the findings of this study also suggest that the unweighted root means squared rms aggregation function could be potentially also used for assessment of coastal water quality findings from this research could inform a range of stakeholders including decision makers researchers and agencies responsible for water quality monitoring assessment and management graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water quality index gaussian processes regression monte carlo simulation uncertainty cork harbour 1 introduction uncertainty quantification uq is an essential step in any experimental or computational assessment as it determines how trustworthy the measured or computed data are this also applies to water quality assessment the water quality index wqi model is a widely used tool for evaluating water quality wq this simple yet powerful tool facilitates the transformation of large quantities of often complex intercorrelated wq data into a single numerical value uddin et al 2017 2022a 2023 its popularity has grown steadily in recent years as a result of its simple architecture ease of application and straightforward result interpretation the wqi model is comprises of four components 1 wq indicators selection 2 sub index si function for converting different units to a uniform scale 3 parameter weight value generation based on their relative importance and 4 aggregation function for combining all three components and converting them into a single value uddin et al 2022a to date over 20 wqi models have been developed by states or organizations worldwide uddin et al 2021 one common and major drawback of these models is the model uncertainty problem there have been many studies that compare various wqi models and assess their predicative abilities these studies mainly discuss the model structure and the effect of aggregation function on wqi scores a small number go further and try to quantify the uncertainty introduced by the various steps of a wqi model it is argued that there are many sources of model uncertainties and they occur at various stages of wqi modelling process abbasi and abbasi 2012 uddin et al 2021 juwana et al 2016 and sutadian et al 2017 found that the sub index functions and weight generation methods may contribute to the generation of model uncertainty however uddin et al 2022b implied that the weighting procedure does not have significant effects on model uncertainty although recent research concludes that the aggregation function contributes to uncertainty generation juwana et al 2016 parween et al 2022 sutadian et al 2018 no quantification of uncertainties at this step has yet been performed as expected the structure of aggregation function in the wqi model has also an effect on the uncertainty abbasi and abbasi 2012 smith 1990 smith 1990 and lumb et al 2011 conducted a comparative study of different wqi models and found a significant variation in a use of unique wq indicators among different aggregation functions uddin et al 2022a compared the performance of eight aggregation functions and found a significant statistical difference in wqi scores produced by these functions model uncertainty and directly linked to it model sensitivity are the most fundamental features and characteristics of a model the uncertainty refers to the result of measurement that reflects a lack of exact knowledge of the value of the measurand rahman and harding 2017 bipm et al 2020 in order to understand the model s accuracy and reliability it is important to estimate the uncertainty sankaran and sarkar 2009 four types of uncertainties are typically evaluated in the models structural functional parameter and data uncertainty ng and perera 2001 sankaran and sarkar 2009 wu et al 2006 uncertainties in wqi models are often related to various components of a model and its processes nonetheless it is unclear how much of the total uncertainty is attributed to each component of the wqi model moreover to the best of our knowledge there is no specific framework for the estimation of the overall propagation of uncertainties in a wqi model in this context the purpose of this study is to understand the generation of uncertainties along the cascade of wqi model processes and accurately quantify how much uncertainty is conveyed by each component of the model for the first time in this study the individual and combined effects of inputs from steps 1 3 to the aggregation function are investigated a variety of methods can be reliably utilized for the quantification of model uncertainty rahman et al 2013 two common techniques widely used are i local and ii global approaches the local technique is adopted to determine the sensitivity of the model s input parameters zhao et al 2011 in contrast the global method is suitable to estimate a range of possible parameter values in the parameter distribution jiang et al 2018 mishra 2009 in this research the monte carlo simulation mcs approach is employed to quantify the uncertainties in the wqi model by following the guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement gum is the fundamental reference guide that provides an in depth description of how to evaluate measurement uncertainty using the mcs method joint committee for guides in metrology 2008 rodríguez et al 1989 the mcs method is both systematic and comprehensive in assessing model uncertainty and as such it is widely used jafari et al 2016 mishra 2009 advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning ml techniques are also widely used to predict model uncertainty abdar et al 2021 tavazza et al 2021 these techniques predict the confidence interval ci of measured values to determine how much data variation occurs in a dataset consequently the model errors can be quantified and optimized using these techniques rahman 2019 in this study the gaussian process regression gpr ml algorithm was applied to predict wqi values with a 95 confidence interval this was followed by a comparative analysis between the mcs and gpr results of model uncertainty to ultimately determine the model efficacy this paper is divided into four main sections in the first section a brief overview of this study is provided section two discusses a new set of tools and techniques that are applied to estimate and predict model uncertainty the analysis and findings are presented in section three and finally in section four conclusions are drawn from this research 2 materials and methods eight widely used wqi models were used to calculate the wqis and the mcs technique was utilized to calculate the uncertainties several statistical tools techniques and ml approaches were used in this study to evaluate the mcs results the methodology developed in this paper is presented graphically in fig 1 and described in detail in the following subsections 2 1 the application domain cork harbour ireland the proposed methodology was applied and tested in cork harbour located on the south coast of ireland fig 2 cork harbour was chosen as it was used for a previous wqi model study by the authors uddin et al 2022a and data were therefore already available the harbour designated as a special protection area spa is ireland s deepest and longest 17 72 km surface water body hartnett and nash 2015 nash et al 2011 the area adjacent to the harbour is one of ireland s most economically promising zones cork harbour receives large quantities of effluent from various sources each year such as industries domestic and municipal waste which results in variable water quality throughout the harbour uddin et al 2020a b 2023 2 2 data collection the irish environmental protection agency epa collects monthly wq data from monitoring sites in irish waterbodies the relevant water quality indicator data for cork harbour were obtained from https www catchments ie data data for eleven water quality indicators including ammonia amn transparency tran total organic nitrogen ton temperature temp dissolved oxygen dox ammoniacal nitrogen amn ph salinity sal molybdate reactive phosphorus mrp biological oxygen demand bod and chlorophyll a chl from 29 monitoring sites were sampled at 1 m depth and at with these data being used in this study the monitoring locations are presented in fig 2 water quality data from 29 out of 36 monitoring stations in cork harbour were obtained from the epa for the period 2019 2020 the detailed water quality data are provided in table s1 and table s2 for the summer and winter periods respectively 2 3 wqi model the wqi model of uddin et al 2022a was used for the study as it was developed specifically for coastal waters and was tested using cork harbour like most wqi models it involves four main stages 1 selection of wq indicators for inclusion 2 calculation of sub indices for each indicator using si functions 3 calculation of weightings for each indicator based on their influence on water quality and 4 calculation of the final wqi using aggregation functions the model was run for summer and winter periods with regard to parameter selection following uddin et al 2022a seven water quality indicators were included for summer chl din amn temp bod mrp and tran and five were included for winter din ton ph dox and tran the following si functions were used to transfer various water quality data onto a uniform scale 1 s i s i u s i l s i u w q m s t d u s t d l 2 s i w q i m s t d l s t d u s t d l s i u 3 s i s i u s i l w q i m s t d l s t d u s t d l s i l and s i u are the lower and upper limits of possible si values 0 and 100 respectively s t d l is lower threshold value s t d u is the upper threshold value and w q m is the measured water quality parameter concentration parameter weighting was determined using the two step process of uddin et al 2022a involving xgboost and the rank order centroid roc methods table s3 and table s4 provide lists of the water quality indicators included in the study corresponding weight values and binary conditions for sub indexes functions these were all pre determined by uddin et al 2022a like uddin et al 2022a eight different aggregation function are tested here four of these were weighted and four unweighted details of the aggregation functions can be found in annex table s5 table s6 provides the si results obtained from the eqs 1 and 2 si functions and the binary rules from table s4 for considered indicators the outputs wqi scores from different aggregation functions are presented in table s1 and table s2 for summer and winter respectively 2 4 model uncertainty the monte carlo simulation mcs approach was used to quantify uncertainties at each stage of the wqi model application the mcs technique is a widely recognised method for the quantification of all types of uncertainties in a system model parametric and nonparametric mcs methods were utilised to generate target random samples and then to calculate the uncertainties for each model component fig 1 provides an overview of the experimental procedure and the following section provides a brief description of the mcs method the four wqi model stages were divided into two categories for uncertainty analysis 1 model input including the selection sub indexing and weighting of water quality indicators and 2 model output including aggregation of the final indices 2 4 1 estimation of uncertainty in wqi model the gum methodology was used to implement the mcs method for the estimation of uncertainties in the model five common statistical measures of uncertainty were employed these were 1 the standard uncertainty su 2 the expanded uncertainty eu 3 the combined uncertainty cu 4 the coverage factors cf and 5 the degree of freedom df i standard uncertainty the standard uncertainty su is widely used to estimate uncertainty in hydrological hydraulic models liang et al 2016 liu et al 2008 rodríguez et al 1989 it refers to the degree of data dispersion from the mean of observations farrance and frenkel 2012 the method requires the definition of all input entities of the model here the selected wq indicators sub indexes and weight values for the model error of an input variable i the su can be defined for each quantity as follows i water quality indicator uncertainties 12 s u p i w q p i α i ii sub index si uncertainties 13 s u s i i s i i α i iii weight uncertainties 14 s u w i w i α i iv model output aggregation functions uncertainties a weighted model 15 s u w q i w w q i w q p i s i i w i α i b unweighted model 16 s u w q i u w w q i w q p i s i i α i where s u p s u s i and s u w are the water quality indicators sub index and parameter weight values respectively s u w q i w is the weighted model output uncertainty and s u w q i u w is the unweighted model output uncertainty w q p i is the ith value of the water quality indicator i s i i is the sub index value and w i is the weight value of i t h variable i α is the variation between predicted and observed mcs values the difference between predicted and observed variances are defined as follows variance 17 v x v α 1 v α 2 v α n if all of the measured and observed random variations α are uncorrelated then standard uncertainty can be defined as 18 s u s x v x s d x n where s u x is the standard uncertainty s x is the standard error of the mean value of each input components and s d x is the mean standard deviation of the random variations in the quantity being measured with the sample true mean the s x can be expressed as 19 s x 1 n 1 i 1 n x i x 2 1 2 where n is the number of random samples x i is the ith data value and x is the sample mean 2 4 2 combined uncertainty cu in a model with multiple model components each model component is a source of uncertainty the combined uncertainty cu describes how the model result varies with changes in each model component meyer 2007 in the case of the wqi model the parameter selection sub indexing process and weighting technique all contribute to the input uncertainty the cu is therefore a measure of the total magnitude of uncertainty associated with all inputs into the wqi model the quadrature root sum of the squares rss method is widely used to calculate the cu value in a model mishra 2009 rss is a measurement of the standard uncertainty for each variable including the coefficient sensitivity in this method all pdfs are combined and converted into the normal distribution based on the central limit theorem guimaraes couto et al 2013 in this study rss was used for quantifying cu as follows 20 c u i 1 n c i s u x i 2 1 2 where cu is the combined uncertainty c i is the sensitivity coefficient and s u x i is the standard uncertainty of the ith water quality indicator the sensitivity coefficient can be represented as follows 21 c i f x i x i y i x i where f x i x i is the changing value of the inputs of the wqi model i e the model components water quality indicators sub indexes and weight values and y i x i is the aggregation process of the wqi model that are changing by independent model input variables 2 4 3 expanded uncertainty eu expanded uncertainty is another statistical tool that can be used to quantify how much of the measurement s range can be assumed to cover a significant portion of the data distribution loucks p d van beek 1981 it is anticipated to include a significant portion of the measured value distribution that can be reasonably linked to the model prediction bipm et al 2020 typically the eu estimates are used to improve the level of confidence in the uncertainty of measured results it usually expands the confidence interval by assuming the t distribution function of the student t test the eu is calculated as follows 22 e u k u c y p where y are the random input variables and k is the coverage factor and u c combine uncertainty of random data the coverage factor can be defined as 23 k t v 1 α 2 where v is the effective number of degree of freedom α 1 p and t is the student s t test well known as t test variable in this research 95 confidence level p is used v is calculated form the welch satterthwaite equation that can be defined as 24 v s x 2 g b x g 2 2 s x 4 v s x g b x g 2 v b x g where v s x is the variance of the measured data for n 1 number of degrees of freedom is 28 in this study whereas v b x g is the variance systematic error shaw 2017 defined as 25 v b x g 1 2 u x g 2 where u x g is the relative uncertainty of b x g the uncertainty of the wqi model was calculated in a multi step process as follows 1 pdfs of all input components were generated 2 prior to performing the mcs the m numbers of trials were set to define measurand and input entities in mcs the trials m can be represented as follows 25 m 10 4 1 p where p is the coverage probability for p 0 95 the number of trials was 2 e 5 commonly higher number of trials is recommended in order to obtain greater convergence in the results 3 after m trials the n random values for α were estimated and applied to equations 12 16 calculate the s u p s u s i and s u w s u w q i w and s u w q i u w values 4 for completed m trials the s u n s u p s u s i and s u w s u w q i w s u w q i u w value calculated in step 3 was used to obtain the statistics of the parameter s x uncertainty can be treated as stable if there is a numerical tolerance that corresponds to the standard deviation of the output quantity this tolerance should be less than two standard deviations of the input quantity the standard uncertainty can be determined from 10 i where i is the integer with a number of decimal places the numerical tolerance can be expresses as 26 τ 1 2 10 i 5 for the optimized mcs algorithm the steps 3 and 4 are repeatedly run for m trails to generate the s x value for each trail 6 finally the p coverage intervals for s x values were evaluated summarized and interpreted in the wqi model for the mcs output 2 5 prediction of wqi model uncertainty 2 5 1 machine learning algorithms ml technique is widely used for predicting unknown objects or analysis of the model performance elgeldawi et al 2021 haghiabi et al 2018 zhu et al 2022 recently several studies have utilized this technique for estimating the model uncertainty with a 95 ci in addition a number of studies have utilized this technique for identifying the faults or biased nature of any model system bode et al 2020 ekici unal and ozleyen 2019 fernandes et al 2022 saufi et al 2019 yang et al 2019 a few studies have utilized this technique for estimating water quality model uncertainty jiang et al 2021 khoi et al 2022 xu et al 2022 in this study the ml technique was utilized to quantify uncertainty in the wqi model because it focuses mostly on population variables that determine the prediction intervals the calculations of uncertainty of each specific prediction can be fairly expensive computationally and usually requires an additional computational effort beyond the training of the model abdar et al 2021 tavazza et al 2021 2 5 1 1 ml models development processes 2 5 1 1 1 data preparation a data standardization prior to develop the ml models it is important to standardize the data for avoiding the model over fitting problems rahman 2019 usually in ml technique this approach used to convert various types of variables into uniform scale in this research data was standardized using the approach of uddin et al 2022c details of the methodology can be found in uddin et al 2022c b preparing training and testing datasets for the purposes of developing the ml models dataset was divided into two sets i 70 20 of training and 30 9 of testing the detail input datasets are provided in table s1 and table s2 for summer and winter respectively 2 5 1 1 2 development of ml models after preparing datasets for training and testing six ml regression algorithms including 1 decision tree dts 2 linear regression lr model 3 gaussian process regression gpr model 4 support vector machines svms 5 neural network nn and 6 ensembles of tree model were trained and tested using training 20 monitoring sites and testing 9 monitoring sites respectively whereas the model performance were evaluated during both training and testing phases details of the ml algorithms can be found in uddin et al 2022c the best fit ml algorithm was selected from six ml techniques based on the trial and error analysis using the regression learner app with matlab r2021b bui et al 2020 for obtaining the best fit ml algorithm s many hyperparameter tuning techniques are used in ml studies the grid search technique is one of them elgeldawi et al 2021 shekar and dagnew 2019 uddin et al 2022c in this research the grid search technique was utilized according to the methodology of shekar dagnew 2019 because compared to other methods this technique is effective in optimizing the model parameters the present study was utilized the regression learner app with matlab r2021b for the identification of optimal parameters of ml models using auto tuning approach based on the trial and error performance results of six ml models the gpr ml model was found to produce the minimum training error and best fit for predicting wqi input dataset details of the gpr ml algorithm can be found in grbić et al 2013 table 1 provides the optimal parameters for the best fitted gpr ml in predicting various wqi model scores the gpr which incorporates bayesian theory and statistical learning theory is an effective method for solving complex regression problems such as high dimensionality and nonlinearity zhang et al 2019 in terms of uncertainty analysis a few studies have reveal that the gpr is different from traditional ml methods in that it automatically determines the prediction uncertainty when the model is fit rasmussen 2004 abdar et al 2021 suggest that the gpr algorithm has a higher predictive accuracy than other algorithms and the technique has been successfully applied for predicting model uncertainty i e asadollah et al 2021 tavazza et al 2021 therefore after obtaining the robust algorithm the gpr ml model was used for predicting wqi values with 95 of ci in order to estimate the model uncertainty once the wqi values and confidence intervals ci were predicted the uncertainty was modelled using the inferential error cumming et al 2007 rahman and harding 2017 27 i n f e r e n t i a l c i m t n 1 s e where m is the observation mean t n 1 is a critical value of t se is the standard error of observations 2 5 2 performance metrics the cross validation approach is widely used to evaluate the ml model performance for relatively small dataset rahman et al 2013 xiong et al 2020 following uddin et al 2022c the 10 fold cross validation technique was utilized to evaluate prediction performance of the gpr model the prediction performance was assessed using the standard error metrics root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae mean square error mse and coefficient of determination r2 defined mathematically as 28 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 29 m a e 1 n i 1 n y i y i 30 m s e 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 31 r 2 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where y i is the actual value of wqi whereas y is the mean predicted wqi value for the ith monitoring site n is the number of water quality monitoring sites 2 5 3 model differences tukey s reference honestly significant difference post hoc test hsd is a widely used statistical approach for differentiating the pairwise comparison among models methods datasets and was used here to compare the pair wise wqi models goeman and solari 2021 the analysis of variance anova using welch s test was applied to validate the significance differences between wqi models recently a number of studies have utilized this approach to compare the overall differences between outputs of models goeman and solari 2021 rouder et al 2016 wang et al 2017 hsd for each pair of mean values was estimated as follows 32 h s d x i x j q 2 m s e 1 n i 1 n j where i j q 2 m s e 1 n i 1 n j is the margin of an error for the confidence intervals q is the multiplier of the distribution n is the number of samples within the group m s e is the mean squared errors and x i and x j are mean values for each group respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparative assessment of water quality status the ultimate aim of the wqi model is to assess the status of water quality using a classification scheme the present study used the classification scheme of uddin et al 2022a table s7 contains more information about the classification system table 2 provides a comparison of the status of water quality using various wqi models tables s8 and s9 for the summer and winter seasons respectively show the overall water quality status at each monitoring site in cork harbour from table 2 it can see that relatively good water quality status was found in the summer season compared to the winter period a significant difference was found in assessing water quality status for various wqi models the results of wqi models indicate that the assessment results varied significantly due to the model architecture similar findings are reported to those of previous studies for cork harbour uddin et al 2020a 2020b 2022a 2022c 2023 3 2 initialization of mcs run the mcs run was initialized for 95 confidence level and 28 degree of freedom including coverage factor k 2 05 meyer 2007 the probability density function pdf of each input parameter is the essential requirement for mcs as they strongly influences the simulation results seifi et al 2020 all input and output pdfs were verified using kolmogorov smirnov test with p value 0 05 the mcs simulations were for m 2 e 5 trials the parametric and non parametric bootstrap tests were carried out to verify the estimated pdfs statistics shaw 2017 3 3 sources of uncertainty in wqi model 3 3 1 model input uncertainty i water quality indicators uncertainty the results of the wq indicators were evaluated graphically and statistically to quantify the input uncertainty of the wqi model figs 3 6 present the actual and mcs simulated pdfs and cumulative distribution function cdfs of all wqi model input entities all of the wq indicators were found to be normally distributed during both seasons fig 3 and fig 5 the uncertainties calculated for each water quality indicator are presented in table 3 the pdf statistics and their corresponding confidence intervals for the mcs results are given in table s10 from figs 3 and 4 there was significant differences between the pdfs and cdfs of the actual and simulated concentrations of water quality indicators during the summer season large data variation was observed for chl din temp bod and tran whereas data consistency was found between actual and simulated for amn and mrp during winter fig 5 6 there was no significant difference found between the actual and simulated data at p 0 0001 except for dox it can be concluded from the results of the cdfs and pdfs that five water quality indicators chl bod din temp and tran contribute to the generation of a small amount of uncertainty in the wqi model through the summer season from table 3 less than 1 of uncertainty was associated with all input indicators during both seasons seasonal intercomparison shows generally lower uncertainty for the winter period the results of water quality indicator inputs indicate that the number of input variables plays a crucial role in producing the uncertainties in the wqi model ii sub index uncertainty several studies argue that the sub indexing process generates high levels of uncertainty in a wqi model but the magnitudes of si uncertainties have never been quantified the mcs technique was used to calculate the levels of uncertainty generated during the sub indexing process the pdfs and cdfs of si values are presented in fig 7 table s10 provides the summary of mcs statistical results for distribution functions of sub indexes the associated uncertainties for each water quality indicator are presented in table 3 the pdfs of sub index functions for all indicators exhibit normal distribution for both seasons during summer season there was a significant difference found between the actual and simulated si values for three parameters din amn and tran fig 7a b similar differences in si were observed in winter season for four parameters dox din ton and tran fig 7c d there was a strong correlation found between the actual and simulated pdf and cdf of si values for bod mrp and chl during summer and for dox during winter from table 3 for summer 7 07 5 34 4 49 4 42 3 81 and 2 98 of su were associated with the si process for tran amn din chl mrp and bod respectively interestingly there was no uncertainty produced by si of temp for winter the si of tran produced the highest su values whereas ph resulted in the lowest table 3 overall the combined uncertainty values associated with the si functions of the water quality indicators were 12 84 and 10 27 for summer and winter respectively thus si functions play an important role in generating uncertainty in the wqi model during both seasons it can be concluded that the si uncertainty varies depending on the spatiotemporal distribution of wqi model inputs iii parameter weighting uncertainty several studies argue that the weighting process generates a considerable amount of uncertainty that contributes to the final wqi score seifi et al 2020 sutadian et al 2017 2016 uddin et al 2021 once again the mcs approach was utilized to estimate the uncertainties generated in the weighting process fig 8 presents the pdfs and cdfs of the actual and simulated weight values for summer and winter table 3 provides the uncertainty results obtained from the mcs analysis of the weight values detailed pdfs statistics and uncertainty intervals are presented in table s10 the indicator weight values were found to have a normal distribution for both seasons no weight variations were found between the actual and simulated values for either season it can be seen from table 3 that less than 1 of uncertainty is attributed to the weighting process these findings suggest that the weighting process of uddin et al 2022b does not significantly contribute to uncertainty generation in the wqi model this is in line with the findings of uddin et al 2022a unlike the findings of this study a few studies have revealed that the weight values can contribute a considerable amount of uncertainty in a wqi model sutadian et al 2018 a impact assessment of input components on the wqi model table 3 provides the uncertainty results obtained from the mcs analysis for each input component of the wqi model comparing the two seasons it can be seen that during summer the uncertainty levels of 0 92 12 82 and 0 18 were attributed to the water quality indicators sub index functions and parameter weight values respectively the total uncertainty of the three inputs together is 13 94 at 95 confidence level for summer season for winter the uncertainties of 0 81 10 27 and 0 21 were attributed to the three processes with a total uncertainty level of 11 29 which is marginaly lower than the summer score as for summer the sub index function uncertainty level has the most significant impact on the wqi score interestingly and perhaps surprisingly this study demonstrates that water quality indicators and weight values have no significant impacts on the model score to our knowledge this is the first research study that quantifies uncertainties at each step of wqi modelling b model output uncertainty the aggregation process is the final step of the wqi model it is used to aggregate the sub indices into a single overall wqi score eight different aggregation functions were assessed to quantify the uncertainties that they contributed to the wqi score the pdfs and cdfs for calculated and simulated results of the eight different aggregation functions 4 weighted and 4 unweighted are presented in figs 9 and 10 respectively the probability distribution of all aggregation functions were normal during both seasons table s11 provides the detailed statistics of mcs for weighted functions significant differences were found between the calculated and simulated wqi values for the srdd and wj models over the study period while lower differences were observed between the calculated and simulated wqi values for the nsf and wqm models during both seasons for unweighted functions in general there were no significant data variation between the calculated and simulated wqis p 0 0001 the hanh model exhibits slightly higher differences than the am and rms models but the ccme model shows very small differences fig 9c 10c d the performance of the ccme function could be attributed to its architecture which differs significantly from the others lumb et al 2011 and uddin et al 2022a found that the ccme model has eclipsing issues linked to overestimation fig 11 presents the results of the standard expanded and combined uncertainty produced by the eight aggregation functions for the weighted methods the wj and the srdd functions contributed the highest uncertainty to final wqi scores during both seasons while the wqm model contributed the lowest level of uncertainty during summer the highest and lowest su values were produced by the wj and the wqm models respectively 6 46 versus 2 22 by comparison during winter the highest and lowest su were produced by the nsf and wqm models respectively 2 39 and 1 59 fig 11a the wj model exhibits the highest expanded uncertainty range while the wqm model had the lowest the expanded uncertainty results indicate that the wj model could generate a larger data variation than other models the wj model exhibits a particularly high sensitivity to inputs during the summer season this implies that the variations in model inputs result in a significant variation in model outputs a well balanced combined uncertainty in the input variables of 2 31 and 1 62 were found for the wqm model through the summer and winter respectively for the unweighted models the ccme and hanh models recorded the lowest and highest levels of uncertainty during both seasons respectively fig 11b similar results for the ccme model were reported in literature ahmed et al 2021 davies 2006 gupta et al 2003 lumb et al 2011 wu et al 2021 zotou et al 2019 there is a significant seasonal difference in the uncertainties between the models with generally lower uncertainty levels observed during the winter season this could be attributed to a variety of reasons including the number of lower number of wq variables used in winter ambiguity of the sub index functions sample sizes and the eclipsing problem of the model aggregation process gupta et al 2003 seifi et al 2020 sutadian et al 2018 uddin et al 2021 2022a a comparison of uncertainty levels generated by the weighted and unweighted models shows that the unweighted models produce lower uncertainties ignoring the ccme model because of its aforementioned problems the weighted wqm and unweighted rms models are recommended for use because they produced the lowest levels of uncertainty the results of the mcs are in line with those of earlier studies carsten von der ohe et al 2007 gupta et al 2003 lumb et al 2011 mladenović ranisavljević and žerajić 2018 wu et al 2021 zotou et al 2019 3 4 predicting uncertainty the gpr model was utilized for predicting wqi model uncertainty table 4 provides the 10 fold cross validation results of the gpr prediction model for the eight wqi models and for summer and winter for the weighted models the lowest prediction error was produced for the wqm model while for the unweighted models the lowest error was for the ccme and rms models fig 12 and fig 13 present linear regression analyses of the gpr predicted scores and those calculated actual using the wqi models generally there is a good fit of the gpr model for both seasons for the purposes of assessing the predictors effect on the model response the present study utilized the coefficient of determination according to the approach of uddin et al 2022a for the determination of r2 the present study used twenty nine samples of water quality data the coefficient of determination was found to be less than 0 8 was found only for the wj and the ccme models during the summer season figs 14 and 15 show the gpr predicted wqi values se and 95 ci for each sampling location in cork harbour for summer and winter respectively table 5 provides the results obtained from the t test analysis of gpr predicted wqi values for the different wqi aggregation functions the t test results indicate that the wqi values predicted for the wqm are noticeably different from the calculated values when compared to the other weighted functions in addition lower se and sd were found for the wqm function than for the other three weighted functions table 5 for unweighted functions similar trends were found for the ccme and the rms models they also exhibited lower se and sd values the results of the predicted uncertainty analysis showed that the wqm and the rms prediction models could be effective for estimating wqi values in terms of model uncertainty the findings of prediction uncertainty agree with uddin et al 2022a which found that the srdd wj and ccme models were highly influenced by eclipsing and ambiguity problems throughout the study period summer and winter there was no significant difference between the predicted and actual wqi mean se or uncertainty intervals as can be seen in fig 16 there was a strong statistically significant difference among the wqi models at p 0 0001 in this research during both seasons the wqm model had the most consistent wqi variation with the lowest uncertainty and se trend table 5 similarly the nsf model had lower se and shorter intervals than the srdd and wj models which exhibited stronger effects of uncertainty in terms of seasonal variability of wqi model uncertainty a significant statistical difference p 0 0001 was found for the wqi models between summer and winter seasons fig 16 overall the model intercomparison for gpr predicted wqi mean se and ci implies that the wqm is the most effective model for assessing coastal water quality in terms of reducing model uncertainty the ranking of wqi models in terms of generated uncertainty levels from highest to lowest is as follows based on the mcs and gpr analyses 3 5 wqi model intercomparison the tukey s hsd approach was used for pair wise analysis to intercompare wqi models fig 17 presents differences between the model means for all combinations of model pairs there was very little difference between the weighted wqm model and unweighted rms model for summer period this is also confirmed by the box plot statistics in fig 18 a a small difference was also found for the nsf hanh model pair the largest differences in means were found during the winter period and this is also confirmed by the boxplot statistics there was a significant difference f value for summer 7127 and winter f 38675 at p 0 0001 respectively in pairwise comparison p 0 0001 between weighted and unweighted wqi models in terms of individual models the wqm is significantly better than other wqi models during both the summer and the winter period it was clearly presented in fig 18 data obtained from the hsd tukey test however the ccme shows an identical statistical pattern to the other models over the study period ahmed et al 2021 davies 2006 pang et al 2021 as this study shows that the ccme aggregation function is a source of large uncertainty in the wqi model and given that it has been shown to be highly susceptible to model eclipsing and ambiguity problems uddin et al 2022a the ccme model is not recommended for water quality assessment gupta et al 2003 lumb et al 2011 mladenović ranisavljević and žerajić 2018 based on the hsd and uncertainty results the wqm model appears to be a reliable tool that performed better than other wqi models in this study this agrees with the findings of uddin et al 2022a 3 6 validation of uncertainty results summary of statistics as assessment of the ml predicted scores versus the wqi calculated scores is presented in the taylor diagrams of fig 19 the diagram helps to visually and numerically evaluate model performance using three statistical properties namely the centred root mean square deviation rmsd the standard deviation sd and the correlation calim et al 2018 the statistics of the calculated and simulated wqi values in cork harbour for summer and winter periods are presented in fig 19 for the summer period the hanh wqm and am models show the smallest discrepancies and display correlation coefficients of over 95 in winter all wqi models cluster around very low sd 5 low rmsd 10 and correlation coefficients over 0 8 the ccme model with correlation coefficients close to 1 0 and near zero rmsd and sd again shows low discrepancies in wqi scores but the eclipsing and ambiguity problems have to be emphasized again with respect to aggregation function it can be seen from the taylor statistics that the unweighted wqi models outperform the weighted wqi models overall the taylors diagram statistics are consistent with the findings of the mcs and gpr analyses and reinforce the conclusion that the weighted wqm and unweighted rms produce lowest uncertainties over the study period in addition compared to the weighted methods the wqm model could be more effective and robust in assessing coastal water quality in terms of the model uncertainty problem 4 conclusion this study is the first attempt to improve the theoretical and experimental understanding of uncertainty in a wqi model many researchers argue that uncertainty is produced throughout the various stages of wqi modelling most of the recent studies imply that the processes of model indicators selection and sub indexing play a significant role in generating uncertainty in a wqi model some studies suggest that the weighting process also has an effect on the wqi model s efficiency and accuracy to date several studies have been conducted which try to evaluate wqi model uncertainty by comparing very generalized statistical measures but the present study is the first effort to estimate model uncertainty by taking the effect of the individual model stages into account in this research a comprehensive quantification of model uncertainty at each step of the wqi model was conducted to understand the individual and combined effects of each contributor of uncertainty in the model the mcs technique was applied to estimate the wqi model uncertainty while the gpr algorithm was utilized to predict uncertainties the major findings of this study can be summarized as follows the values of the selected water quality indicators generated less than 1 of the total model uncertainty however the number of input indicators was found to have a significant impact on the model s input uncertainties sub index functions were found to contribute significantly to the wqi model uncertainties and hence affect the model reliability therefore the determination of sub index functions needs to be taken with care the weighting component produces relatively low levels of uncertainties significant statistical differences were found between the eight aggregation functions tested the weighted quadratic mean wqm function was found to provide a plausible assessment of the wq of coastal waters at reduced uncertainty levels the findings of this study also suggest that the unweighted root mean squared rms aggregation function could also be potentially used for assessment of coastal wq finally the wqm and rms models were found to exhibit a higher prediction accuracy and these wqi models could be effective and reliable tools to provide low uncertainty assessment of water quality status this research provides a robust statistically sound methodology for assessment of wqi model uncertainties a set of statistical tools in this method can be used to identify sources of uncertainty quantify them and evaluate their impact on the overall model performance therefore the finding of this research could aid a range of stakeholders including decision makers researchers and agencies responsible for water quality monitoring assessment and management the methodology was only tested for one domain application for its further improvement and validation it should be applied to various types of waterbodies declaration of competing interest

15205,with the significant increase in wqi applications worldwide and lack of specific application guidelines accuracy and reliability of wqi models is a major issue it has been reported that wqi models produce significant uncertainties during the various stages of their application including i water quality indicator selection ii sub index si calculation iii water quality indicator weighting and iv aggregation of sub indices to calculate the overall index this research provides a robust statistically sound methodology for assessment of wqi model uncertainties eight wqi models are considered the monte carlo simulation mcs technique was applied to estimate model uncertainty while the gaussian process regression gpr algorithm was utilised to predict uncertainties in the wqi models at each sampling site the sub index functions were found to contribute to considerable uncertainty and hence affect the model reliability they contributed 12 86 and 10 27 of uncertainty for summer and winter applications respectively therefore the selection of sub index function needs to be made with care a low uncertainty of less than 1 was produced by the water quality indicator selection and weighting processes significant statistical differences were found between various aggregation functions the weighted quadratic mean wqm function was found to provide a plausible assessment of water quality of coastal waters at reduced uncertainty levels the findings of this study also suggest that the unweighted root means squared rms aggregation function could be potentially also used for assessment of coastal water quality findings from this research could inform a range of stakeholders including decision makers researchers and agencies responsible for water quality monitoring assessment and management graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water quality index gaussian processes regression monte carlo simulation uncertainty cork harbour 1 introduction uncertainty quantification uq is an essential step in any experimental or computational assessment as it determines how trustworthy the measured or computed data are this also applies to water quality assessment the water quality index wqi model is a widely used tool for evaluating water quality wq this simple yet powerful tool facilitates the transformation of large quantities of often complex intercorrelated wq data into a single numerical value uddin et al 2017 2022a 2023 its popularity has grown steadily in recent years as a result of its simple architecture ease of application and straightforward result interpretation the wqi model is comprises of four components 1 wq indicators selection 2 sub index si function for converting different units to a uniform scale 3 parameter weight value generation based on their relative importance and 4 aggregation function for combining all three components and converting them into a single value uddin et al 2022a to date over 20 wqi models have been developed by states or organizations worldwide uddin et al 2021 one common and major drawback of these models is the model uncertainty problem there have been many studies that compare various wqi models and assess their predicative abilities these studies mainly discuss the model structure and the effect of aggregation function on wqi scores a small number go further and try to quantify the uncertainty introduced by the various steps of a wqi model it is argued that there are many sources of model uncertainties and they occur at various stages of wqi modelling process abbasi and abbasi 2012 uddin et al 2021 juwana et al 2016 and sutadian et al 2017 found that the sub index functions and weight generation methods may contribute to the generation of model uncertainty however uddin et al 2022b implied that the weighting procedure does not have significant effects on model uncertainty although recent research concludes that the aggregation function contributes to uncertainty generation juwana et al 2016 parween et al 2022 sutadian et al 2018 no quantification of uncertainties at this step has yet been performed as expected the structure of aggregation function in the wqi model has also an effect on the uncertainty abbasi and abbasi 2012 smith 1990 smith 1990 and lumb et al 2011 conducted a comparative study of different wqi models and found a significant variation in a use of unique wq indicators among different aggregation functions uddin et al 2022a compared the performance of eight aggregation functions and found a significant statistical difference in wqi scores produced by these functions model uncertainty and directly linked to it model sensitivity are the most fundamental features and characteristics of a model the uncertainty refers to the result of measurement that reflects a lack of exact knowledge of the value of the measurand rahman and harding 2017 bipm et al 2020 in order to understand the model s accuracy and reliability it is important to estimate the uncertainty sankaran and sarkar 2009 four types of uncertainties are typically evaluated in the models structural functional parameter and data uncertainty ng and perera 2001 sankaran and sarkar 2009 wu et al 2006 uncertainties in wqi models are often related to various components of a model and its processes nonetheless it is unclear how much of the total uncertainty is attributed to each component of the wqi model moreover to the best of our knowledge there is no specific framework for the estimation of the overall propagation of uncertainties in a wqi model in this context the purpose of this study is to understand the generation of uncertainties along the cascade of wqi model processes and accurately quantify how much uncertainty is conveyed by each component of the model for the first time in this study the individual and combined effects of inputs from steps 1 3 to the aggregation function are investigated a variety of methods can be reliably utilized for the quantification of model uncertainty rahman et al 2013 two common techniques widely used are i local and ii global approaches the local technique is adopted to determine the sensitivity of the model s input parameters zhao et al 2011 in contrast the global method is suitable to estimate a range of possible parameter values in the parameter distribution jiang et al 2018 mishra 2009 in this research the monte carlo simulation mcs approach is employed to quantify the uncertainties in the wqi model by following the guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement gum is the fundamental reference guide that provides an in depth description of how to evaluate measurement uncertainty using the mcs method joint committee for guides in metrology 2008 rodríguez et al 1989 the mcs method is both systematic and comprehensive in assessing model uncertainty and as such it is widely used jafari et al 2016 mishra 2009 advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning ml techniques are also widely used to predict model uncertainty abdar et al 2021 tavazza et al 2021 these techniques predict the confidence interval ci of measured values to determine how much data variation occurs in a dataset consequently the model errors can be quantified and optimized using these techniques rahman 2019 in this study the gaussian process regression gpr ml algorithm was applied to predict wqi values with a 95 confidence interval this was followed by a comparative analysis between the mcs and gpr results of model uncertainty to ultimately determine the model efficacy this paper is divided into four main sections in the first section a brief overview of this study is provided section two discusses a new set of tools and techniques that are applied to estimate and predict model uncertainty the analysis and findings are presented in section three and finally in section four conclusions are drawn from this research 2 materials and methods eight widely used wqi models were used to calculate the wqis and the mcs technique was utilized to calculate the uncertainties several statistical tools techniques and ml approaches were used in this study to evaluate the mcs results the methodology developed in this paper is presented graphically in fig 1 and described in detail in the following subsections 2 1 the application domain cork harbour ireland the proposed methodology was applied and tested in cork harbour located on the south coast of ireland fig 2 cork harbour was chosen as it was used for a previous wqi model study by the authors uddin et al 2022a and data were therefore already available the harbour designated as a special protection area spa is ireland s deepest and longest 17 72 km surface water body hartnett and nash 2015 nash et al 2011 the area adjacent to the harbour is one of ireland s most economically promising zones cork harbour receives large quantities of effluent from various sources each year such as industries domestic and municipal waste which results in variable water quality throughout the harbour uddin et al 2020a b 2023 2 2 data collection the irish environmental protection agency epa collects monthly wq data from monitoring sites in irish waterbodies the relevant water quality indicator data for cork harbour were obtained from https www catchments ie data data for eleven water quality indicators including ammonia amn transparency tran total organic nitrogen ton temperature temp dissolved oxygen dox ammoniacal nitrogen amn ph salinity sal molybdate reactive phosphorus mrp biological oxygen demand bod and chlorophyll a chl from 29 monitoring sites were sampled at 1 m depth and at with these data being used in this study the monitoring locations are presented in fig 2 water quality data from 29 out of 36 monitoring stations in cork harbour were obtained from the epa for the period 2019 2020 the detailed water quality data are provided in table s1 and table s2 for the summer and winter periods respectively 2 3 wqi model the wqi model of uddin et al 2022a was used for the study as it was developed specifically for coastal waters and was tested using cork harbour like most wqi models it involves four main stages 1 selection of wq indicators for inclusion 2 calculation of sub indices for each indicator using si functions 3 calculation of weightings for each indicator based on their influence on water quality and 4 calculation of the final wqi using aggregation functions the model was run for summer and winter periods with regard to parameter selection following uddin et al 2022a seven water quality indicators were included for summer chl din amn temp bod mrp and tran and five were included for winter din ton ph dox and tran the following si functions were used to transfer various water quality data onto a uniform scale 1 s i s i u s i l s i u w q m s t d u s t d l 2 s i w q i m s t d l s t d u s t d l s i u 3 s i s i u s i l w q i m s t d l s t d u s t d l s i l and s i u are the lower and upper limits of possible si values 0 and 100 respectively s t d l is lower threshold value s t d u is the upper threshold value and w q m is the measured water quality parameter concentration parameter weighting was determined using the two step process of uddin et al 2022a involving xgboost and the rank order centroid roc methods table s3 and table s4 provide lists of the water quality indicators included in the study corresponding weight values and binary conditions for sub indexes functions these were all pre determined by uddin et al 2022a like uddin et al 2022a eight different aggregation function are tested here four of these were weighted and four unweighted details of the aggregation functions can be found in annex table s5 table s6 provides the si results obtained from the eqs 1 and 2 si functions and the binary rules from table s4 for considered indicators the outputs wqi scores from different aggregation functions are presented in table s1 and table s2 for summer and winter respectively 2 4 model uncertainty the monte carlo simulation mcs approach was used to quantify uncertainties at each stage of the wqi model application the mcs technique is a widely recognised method for the quantification of all types of uncertainties in a system model parametric and nonparametric mcs methods were utilised to generate target random samples and then to calculate the uncertainties for each model component fig 1 provides an overview of the experimental procedure and the following section provides a brief description of the mcs method the four wqi model stages were divided into two categories for uncertainty analysis 1 model input including the selection sub indexing and weighting of water quality indicators and 2 model output including aggregation of the final indices 2 4 1 estimation of uncertainty in wqi model the gum methodology was used to implement the mcs method for the estimation of uncertainties in the model five common statistical measures of uncertainty were employed these were 1 the standard uncertainty su 2 the expanded uncertainty eu 3 the combined uncertainty cu 4 the coverage factors cf and 5 the degree of freedom df i standard uncertainty the standard uncertainty su is widely used to estimate uncertainty in hydrological hydraulic models liang et al 2016 liu et al 2008 rodríguez et al 1989 it refers to the degree of data dispersion from the mean of observations farrance and frenkel 2012 the method requires the definition of all input entities of the model here the selected wq indicators sub indexes and weight values for the model error of an input variable i the su can be defined for each quantity as follows i water quality indicator uncertainties 12 s u p i w q p i α i ii sub index si uncertainties 13 s u s i i s i i α i iii weight uncertainties 14 s u w i w i α i iv model output aggregation functions uncertainties a weighted model 15 s u w q i w w q i w q p i s i i w i α i b unweighted model 16 s u w q i u w w q i w q p i s i i α i where s u p s u s i and s u w are the water quality indicators sub index and parameter weight values respectively s u w q i w is the weighted model output uncertainty and s u w q i u w is the unweighted model output uncertainty w q p i is the ith value of the water quality indicator i s i i is the sub index value and w i is the weight value of i t h variable i α is the variation between predicted and observed mcs values the difference between predicted and observed variances are defined as follows variance 17 v x v α 1 v α 2 v α n if all of the measured and observed random variations α are uncorrelated then standard uncertainty can be defined as 18 s u s x v x s d x n where s u x is the standard uncertainty s x is the standard error of the mean value of each input components and s d x is the mean standard deviation of the random variations in the quantity being measured with the sample true mean the s x can be expressed as 19 s x 1 n 1 i 1 n x i x 2 1 2 where n is the number of random samples x i is the ith data value and x is the sample mean 2 4 2 combined uncertainty cu in a model with multiple model components each model component is a source of uncertainty the combined uncertainty cu describes how the model result varies with changes in each model component meyer 2007 in the case of the wqi model the parameter selection sub indexing process and weighting technique all contribute to the input uncertainty the cu is therefore a measure of the total magnitude of uncertainty associated with all inputs into the wqi model the quadrature root sum of the squares rss method is widely used to calculate the cu value in a model mishra 2009 rss is a measurement of the standard uncertainty for each variable including the coefficient sensitivity in this method all pdfs are combined and converted into the normal distribution based on the central limit theorem guimaraes couto et al 2013 in this study rss was used for quantifying cu as follows 20 c u i 1 n c i s u x i 2 1 2 where cu is the combined uncertainty c i is the sensitivity coefficient and s u x i is the standard uncertainty of the ith water quality indicator the sensitivity coefficient can be represented as follows 21 c i f x i x i y i x i where f x i x i is the changing value of the inputs of the wqi model i e the model components water quality indicators sub indexes and weight values and y i x i is the aggregation process of the wqi model that are changing by independent model input variables 2 4 3 expanded uncertainty eu expanded uncertainty is another statistical tool that can be used to quantify how much of the measurement s range can be assumed to cover a significant portion of the data distribution loucks p d van beek 1981 it is anticipated to include a significant portion of the measured value distribution that can be reasonably linked to the model prediction bipm et al 2020 typically the eu estimates are used to improve the level of confidence in the uncertainty of measured results it usually expands the confidence interval by assuming the t distribution function of the student t test the eu is calculated as follows 22 e u k u c y p where y are the random input variables and k is the coverage factor and u c combine uncertainty of random data the coverage factor can be defined as 23 k t v 1 α 2 where v is the effective number of degree of freedom α 1 p and t is the student s t test well known as t test variable in this research 95 confidence level p is used v is calculated form the welch satterthwaite equation that can be defined as 24 v s x 2 g b x g 2 2 s x 4 v s x g b x g 2 v b x g where v s x is the variance of the measured data for n 1 number of degrees of freedom is 28 in this study whereas v b x g is the variance systematic error shaw 2017 defined as 25 v b x g 1 2 u x g 2 where u x g is the relative uncertainty of b x g the uncertainty of the wqi model was calculated in a multi step process as follows 1 pdfs of all input components were generated 2 prior to performing the mcs the m numbers of trials were set to define measurand and input entities in mcs the trials m can be represented as follows 25 m 10 4 1 p where p is the coverage probability for p 0 95 the number of trials was 2 e 5 commonly higher number of trials is recommended in order to obtain greater convergence in the results 3 after m trials the n random values for α were estimated and applied to equations 12 16 calculate the s u p s u s i and s u w s u w q i w and s u w q i u w values 4 for completed m trials the s u n s u p s u s i and s u w s u w q i w s u w q i u w value calculated in step 3 was used to obtain the statistics of the parameter s x uncertainty can be treated as stable if there is a numerical tolerance that corresponds to the standard deviation of the output quantity this tolerance should be less than two standard deviations of the input quantity the standard uncertainty can be determined from 10 i where i is the integer with a number of decimal places the numerical tolerance can be expresses as 26 τ 1 2 10 i 5 for the optimized mcs algorithm the steps 3 and 4 are repeatedly run for m trails to generate the s x value for each trail 6 finally the p coverage intervals for s x values were evaluated summarized and interpreted in the wqi model for the mcs output 2 5 prediction of wqi model uncertainty 2 5 1 machine learning algorithms ml technique is widely used for predicting unknown objects or analysis of the model performance elgeldawi et al 2021 haghiabi et al 2018 zhu et al 2022 recently several studies have utilized this technique for estimating the model uncertainty with a 95 ci in addition a number of studies have utilized this technique for identifying the faults or biased nature of any model system bode et al 2020 ekici unal and ozleyen 2019 fernandes et al 2022 saufi et al 2019 yang et al 2019 a few studies have utilized this technique for estimating water quality model uncertainty jiang et al 2021 khoi et al 2022 xu et al 2022 in this study the ml technique was utilized to quantify uncertainty in the wqi model because it focuses mostly on population variables that determine the prediction intervals the calculations of uncertainty of each specific prediction can be fairly expensive computationally and usually requires an additional computational effort beyond the training of the model abdar et al 2021 tavazza et al 2021 2 5 1 1 ml models development processes 2 5 1 1 1 data preparation a data standardization prior to develop the ml models it is important to standardize the data for avoiding the model over fitting problems rahman 2019 usually in ml technique this approach used to convert various types of variables into uniform scale in this research data was standardized using the approach of uddin et al 2022c details of the methodology can be found in uddin et al 2022c b preparing training and testing datasets for the purposes of developing the ml models dataset was divided into two sets i 70 20 of training and 30 9 of testing the detail input datasets are provided in table s1 and table s2 for summer and winter respectively 2 5 1 1 2 development of ml models after preparing datasets for training and testing six ml regression algorithms including 1 decision tree dts 2 linear regression lr model 3 gaussian process regression gpr model 4 support vector machines svms 5 neural network nn and 6 ensembles of tree model were trained and tested using training 20 monitoring sites and testing 9 monitoring sites respectively whereas the model performance were evaluated during both training and testing phases details of the ml algorithms can be found in uddin et al 2022c the best fit ml algorithm was selected from six ml techniques based on the trial and error analysis using the regression learner app with matlab r2021b bui et al 2020 for obtaining the best fit ml algorithm s many hyperparameter tuning techniques are used in ml studies the grid search technique is one of them elgeldawi et al 2021 shekar and dagnew 2019 uddin et al 2022c in this research the grid search technique was utilized according to the methodology of shekar dagnew 2019 because compared to other methods this technique is effective in optimizing the model parameters the present study was utilized the regression learner app with matlab r2021b for the identification of optimal parameters of ml models using auto tuning approach based on the trial and error performance results of six ml models the gpr ml model was found to produce the minimum training error and best fit for predicting wqi input dataset details of the gpr ml algorithm can be found in grbić et al 2013 table 1 provides the optimal parameters for the best fitted gpr ml in predicting various wqi model scores the gpr which incorporates bayesian theory and statistical learning theory is an effective method for solving complex regression problems such as high dimensionality and nonlinearity zhang et al 2019 in terms of uncertainty analysis a few studies have reveal that the gpr is different from traditional ml methods in that it automatically determines the prediction uncertainty when the model is fit rasmussen 2004 abdar et al 2021 suggest that the gpr algorithm has a higher predictive accuracy than other algorithms and the technique has been successfully applied for predicting model uncertainty i e asadollah et al 2021 tavazza et al 2021 therefore after obtaining the robust algorithm the gpr ml model was used for predicting wqi values with 95 of ci in order to estimate the model uncertainty once the wqi values and confidence intervals ci were predicted the uncertainty was modelled using the inferential error cumming et al 2007 rahman and harding 2017 27 i n f e r e n t i a l c i m t n 1 s e where m is the observation mean t n 1 is a critical value of t se is the standard error of observations 2 5 2 performance metrics the cross validation approach is widely used to evaluate the ml model performance for relatively small dataset rahman et al 2013 xiong et al 2020 following uddin et al 2022c the 10 fold cross validation technique was utilized to evaluate prediction performance of the gpr model the prediction performance was assessed using the standard error metrics root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae mean square error mse and coefficient of determination r2 defined mathematically as 28 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 29 m a e 1 n i 1 n y i y i 30 m s e 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 31 r 2 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where y i is the actual value of wqi whereas y is the mean predicted wqi value for the ith monitoring site n is the number of water quality monitoring sites 2 5 3 model differences tukey s reference honestly significant difference post hoc test hsd is a widely used statistical approach for differentiating the pairwise comparison among models methods datasets and was used here to compare the pair wise wqi models goeman and solari 2021 the analysis of variance anova using welch s test was applied to validate the significance differences between wqi models recently a number of studies have utilized this approach to compare the overall differences between outputs of models goeman and solari 2021 rouder et al 2016 wang et al 2017 hsd for each pair of mean values was estimated as follows 32 h s d x i x j q 2 m s e 1 n i 1 n j where i j q 2 m s e 1 n i 1 n j is the margin of an error for the confidence intervals q is the multiplier of the distribution n is the number of samples within the group m s e is the mean squared errors and x i and x j are mean values for each group respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparative assessment of water quality status the ultimate aim of the wqi model is to assess the status of water quality using a classification scheme the present study used the classification scheme of uddin et al 2022a table s7 contains more information about the classification system table 2 provides a comparison of the status of water quality using various wqi models tables s8 and s9 for the summer and winter seasons respectively show the overall water quality status at each monitoring site in cork harbour from table 2 it can see that relatively good water quality status was found in the summer season compared to the winter period a significant difference was found in assessing water quality status for various wqi models the results of wqi models indicate that the assessment results varied significantly due to the model architecture similar findings are reported to those of previous studies for cork harbour uddin et al 2020a 2020b 2022a 2022c 2023 3 2 initialization of mcs run the mcs run was initialized for 95 confidence level and 28 degree of freedom including coverage factor k 2 05 meyer 2007 the probability density function pdf of each input parameter is the essential requirement for mcs as they strongly influences the simulation results seifi et al 2020 all input and output pdfs were verified using kolmogorov smirnov test with p value 0 05 the mcs simulations were for m 2 e 5 trials the parametric and non parametric bootstrap tests were carried out to verify the estimated pdfs statistics shaw 2017 3 3 sources of uncertainty in wqi model 3 3 1 model input uncertainty i water quality indicators uncertainty the results of the wq indicators were evaluated graphically and statistically to quantify the input uncertainty of the wqi model figs 3 6 present the actual and mcs simulated pdfs and cumulative distribution function cdfs of all wqi model input entities all of the wq indicators were found to be normally distributed during both seasons fig 3 and fig 5 the uncertainties calculated for each water quality indicator are presented in table 3 the pdf statistics and their corresponding confidence intervals for the mcs results are given in table s10 from figs 3 and 4 there was significant differences between the pdfs and cdfs of the actual and simulated concentrations of water quality indicators during the summer season large data variation was observed for chl din temp bod and tran whereas data consistency was found between actual and simulated for amn and mrp during winter fig 5 6 there was no significant difference found between the actual and simulated data at p 0 0001 except for dox it can be concluded from the results of the cdfs and pdfs that five water quality indicators chl bod din temp and tran contribute to the generation of a small amount of uncertainty in the wqi model through the summer season from table 3 less than 1 of uncertainty was associated with all input indicators during both seasons seasonal intercomparison shows generally lower uncertainty for the winter period the results of water quality indicator inputs indicate that the number of input variables plays a crucial role in producing the uncertainties in the wqi model ii sub index uncertainty several studies argue that the sub indexing process generates high levels of uncertainty in a wqi model but the magnitudes of si uncertainties have never been quantified the mcs technique was used to calculate the levels of uncertainty generated during the sub indexing process the pdfs and cdfs of si values are presented in fig 7 table s10 provides the summary of mcs statistical results for distribution functions of sub indexes the associated uncertainties for each water quality indicator are presented in table 3 the pdfs of sub index functions for all indicators exhibit normal distribution for both seasons during summer season there was a significant difference found between the actual and simulated si values for three parameters din amn and tran fig 7a b similar differences in si were observed in winter season for four parameters dox din ton and tran fig 7c d there was a strong correlation found between the actual and simulated pdf and cdf of si values for bod mrp and chl during summer and for dox during winter from table 3 for summer 7 07 5 34 4 49 4 42 3 81 and 2 98 of su were associated with the si process for tran amn din chl mrp and bod respectively interestingly there was no uncertainty produced by si of temp for winter the si of tran produced the highest su values whereas ph resulted in the lowest table 3 overall the combined uncertainty values associated with the si functions of the water quality indicators were 12 84 and 10 27 for summer and winter respectively thus si functions play an important role in generating uncertainty in the wqi model during both seasons it can be concluded that the si uncertainty varies depending on the spatiotemporal distribution of wqi model inputs iii parameter weighting uncertainty several studies argue that the weighting process generates a considerable amount of uncertainty that contributes to the final wqi score seifi et al 2020 sutadian et al 2017 2016 uddin et al 2021 once again the mcs approach was utilized to estimate the uncertainties generated in the weighting process fig 8 presents the pdfs and cdfs of the actual and simulated weight values for summer and winter table 3 provides the uncertainty results obtained from the mcs analysis of the weight values detailed pdfs statistics and uncertainty intervals are presented in table s10 the indicator weight values were found to have a normal distribution for both seasons no weight variations were found between the actual and simulated values for either season it can be seen from table 3 that less than 1 of uncertainty is attributed to the weighting process these findings suggest that the weighting process of uddin et al 2022b does not significantly contribute to uncertainty generation in the wqi model this is in line with the findings of uddin et al 2022a unlike the findings of this study a few studies have revealed that the weight values can contribute a considerable amount of uncertainty in a wqi model sutadian et al 2018 a impact assessment of input components on the wqi model table 3 provides the uncertainty results obtained from the mcs analysis for each input component of the wqi model comparing the two seasons it can be seen that during summer the uncertainty levels of 0 92 12 82 and 0 18 were attributed to the water quality indicators sub index functions and parameter weight values respectively the total uncertainty of the three inputs together is 13 94 at 95 confidence level for summer season for winter the uncertainties of 0 81 10 27 and 0 21 were attributed to the three processes with a total uncertainty level of 11 29 which is marginaly lower than the summer score as for summer the sub index function uncertainty level has the most significant impact on the wqi score interestingly and perhaps surprisingly this study demonstrates that water quality indicators and weight values have no significant impacts on the model score to our knowledge this is the first research study that quantifies uncertainties at each step of wqi modelling b model output uncertainty the aggregation process is the final step of the wqi model it is used to aggregate the sub indices into a single overall wqi score eight different aggregation functions were assessed to quantify the uncertainties that they contributed to the wqi score the pdfs and cdfs for calculated and simulated results of the eight different aggregation functions 4 weighted and 4 unweighted are presented in figs 9 and 10 respectively the probability distribution of all aggregation functions were normal during both seasons table s11 provides the detailed statistics of mcs for weighted functions significant differences were found between the calculated and simulated wqi values for the srdd and wj models over the study period while lower differences were observed between the calculated and simulated wqi values for the nsf and wqm models during both seasons for unweighted functions in general there were no significant data variation between the calculated and simulated wqis p 0 0001 the hanh model exhibits slightly higher differences than the am and rms models but the ccme model shows very small differences fig 9c 10c d the performance of the ccme function could be attributed to its architecture which differs significantly from the others lumb et al 2011 and uddin et al 2022a found that the ccme model has eclipsing issues linked to overestimation fig 11 presents the results of the standard expanded and combined uncertainty produced by the eight aggregation functions for the weighted methods the wj and the srdd functions contributed the highest uncertainty to final wqi scores during both seasons while the wqm model contributed the lowest level of uncertainty during summer the highest and lowest su values were produced by the wj and the wqm models respectively 6 46 versus 2 22 by comparison during winter the highest and lowest su were produced by the nsf and wqm models respectively 2 39 and 1 59 fig 11a the wj model exhibits the highest expanded uncertainty range while the wqm model had the lowest the expanded uncertainty results indicate that the wj model could generate a larger data variation than other models the wj model exhibits a particularly high sensitivity to inputs during the summer season this implies that the variations in model inputs result in a significant variation in model outputs a well balanced combined uncertainty in the input variables of 2 31 and 1 62 were found for the wqm model through the summer and winter respectively for the unweighted models the ccme and hanh models recorded the lowest and highest levels of uncertainty during both seasons respectively fig 11b similar results for the ccme model were reported in literature ahmed et al 2021 davies 2006 gupta et al 2003 lumb et al 2011 wu et al 2021 zotou et al 2019 there is a significant seasonal difference in the uncertainties between the models with generally lower uncertainty levels observed during the winter season this could be attributed to a variety of reasons including the number of lower number of wq variables used in winter ambiguity of the sub index functions sample sizes and the eclipsing problem of the model aggregation process gupta et al 2003 seifi et al 2020 sutadian et al 2018 uddin et al 2021 2022a a comparison of uncertainty levels generated by the weighted and unweighted models shows that the unweighted models produce lower uncertainties ignoring the ccme model because of its aforementioned problems the weighted wqm and unweighted rms models are recommended for use because they produced the lowest levels of uncertainty the results of the mcs are in line with those of earlier studies carsten von der ohe et al 2007 gupta et al 2003 lumb et al 2011 mladenović ranisavljević and žerajić 2018 wu et al 2021 zotou et al 2019 3 4 predicting uncertainty the gpr model was utilized for predicting wqi model uncertainty table 4 provides the 10 fold cross validation results of the gpr prediction model for the eight wqi models and for summer and winter for the weighted models the lowest prediction error was produced for the wqm model while for the unweighted models the lowest error was for the ccme and rms models fig 12 and fig 13 present linear regression analyses of the gpr predicted scores and those calculated actual using the wqi models generally there is a good fit of the gpr model for both seasons for the purposes of assessing the predictors effect on the model response the present study utilized the coefficient of determination according to the approach of uddin et al 2022a for the determination of r2 the present study used twenty nine samples of water quality data the coefficient of determination was found to be less than 0 8 was found only for the wj and the ccme models during the summer season figs 14 and 15 show the gpr predicted wqi values se and 95 ci for each sampling location in cork harbour for summer and winter respectively table 5 provides the results obtained from the t test analysis of gpr predicted wqi values for the different wqi aggregation functions the t test results indicate that the wqi values predicted for the wqm are noticeably different from the calculated values when compared to the other weighted functions in addition lower se and sd were found for the wqm function than for the other three weighted functions table 5 for unweighted functions similar trends were found for the ccme and the rms models they also exhibited lower se and sd values the results of the predicted uncertainty analysis showed that the wqm and the rms prediction models could be effective for estimating wqi values in terms of model uncertainty the findings of prediction uncertainty agree with uddin et al 2022a which found that the srdd wj and ccme models were highly influenced by eclipsing and ambiguity problems throughout the study period summer and winter there was no significant difference between the predicted and actual wqi mean se or uncertainty intervals as can be seen in fig 16 there was a strong statistically significant difference among the wqi models at p 0 0001 in this research during both seasons the wqm model had the most consistent wqi variation with the lowest uncertainty and se trend table 5 similarly the nsf model had lower se and shorter intervals than the srdd and wj models which exhibited stronger effects of uncertainty in terms of seasonal variability of wqi model uncertainty a significant statistical difference p 0 0001 was found for the wqi models between summer and winter seasons fig 16 overall the model intercomparison for gpr predicted wqi mean se and ci implies that the wqm is the most effective model for assessing coastal water quality in terms of reducing model uncertainty the ranking of wqi models in terms of generated uncertainty levels from highest to lowest is as follows based on the mcs and gpr analyses 3 5 wqi model intercomparison the tukey s hsd approach was used for pair wise analysis to intercompare wqi models fig 17 presents differences between the model means for all combinations of model pairs there was very little difference between the weighted wqm model and unweighted rms model for summer period this is also confirmed by the box plot statistics in fig 18 a a small difference was also found for the nsf hanh model pair the largest differences in means were found during the winter period and this is also confirmed by the boxplot statistics there was a significant difference f value for summer 7127 and winter f 38675 at p 0 0001 respectively in pairwise comparison p 0 0001 between weighted and unweighted wqi models in terms of individual models the wqm is significantly better than other wqi models during both the summer and the winter period it was clearly presented in fig 18 data obtained from the hsd tukey test however the ccme shows an identical statistical pattern to the other models over the study period ahmed et al 2021 davies 2006 pang et al 2021 as this study shows that the ccme aggregation function is a source of large uncertainty in the wqi model and given that it has been shown to be highly susceptible to model eclipsing and ambiguity problems uddin et al 2022a the ccme model is not recommended for water quality assessment gupta et al 2003 lumb et al 2011 mladenović ranisavljević and žerajić 2018 based on the hsd and uncertainty results the wqm model appears to be a reliable tool that performed better than other wqi models in this study this agrees with the findings of uddin et al 2022a 3 6 validation of uncertainty results summary of statistics as assessment of the ml predicted scores versus the wqi calculated scores is presented in the taylor diagrams of fig 19 the diagram helps to visually and numerically evaluate model performance using three statistical properties namely the centred root mean square deviation rmsd the standard deviation sd and the correlation calim et al 2018 the statistics of the calculated and simulated wqi values in cork harbour for summer and winter periods are presented in fig 19 for the summer period the hanh wqm and am models show the smallest discrepancies and display correlation coefficients of over 95 in winter all wqi models cluster around very low sd 5 low rmsd 10 and correlation coefficients over 0 8 the ccme model with correlation coefficients close to 1 0 and near zero rmsd and sd again shows low discrepancies in wqi scores but the eclipsing and ambiguity problems have to be emphasized again with respect to aggregation function it can be seen from the taylor statistics that the unweighted wqi models outperform the weighted wqi models overall the taylors diagram statistics are consistent with the findings of the mcs and gpr analyses and reinforce the conclusion that the weighted wqm and unweighted rms produce lowest uncertainties over the study period in addition compared to the weighted methods the wqm model could be more effective and robust in assessing coastal water quality in terms of the model uncertainty problem 4 conclusion this study is the first attempt to improve the theoretical and experimental understanding of uncertainty in a wqi model many researchers argue that uncertainty is produced throughout the various stages of wqi modelling most of the recent studies imply that the processes of model indicators selection and sub indexing play a significant role in generating uncertainty in a wqi model some studies suggest that the weighting process also has an effect on the wqi model s efficiency and accuracy to date several studies have been conducted which try to evaluate wqi model uncertainty by comparing very generalized statistical measures but the present study is the first effort to estimate model uncertainty by taking the effect of the individual model stages into account in this research a comprehensive quantification of model uncertainty at each step of the wqi model was conducted to understand the individual and combined effects of each contributor of uncertainty in the model the mcs technique was applied to estimate the wqi model uncertainty while the gpr algorithm was utilized to predict uncertainties the major findings of this study can be summarized as follows the values of the selected water quality indicators generated less than 1 of the total model uncertainty however the number of input indicators was found to have a significant impact on the model s input uncertainties sub index functions were found to contribute significantly to the wqi model uncertainties and hence affect the model reliability therefore the determination of sub index functions needs to be taken with care the weighting component produces relatively low levels of uncertainties significant statistical differences were found between the eight aggregation functions tested the weighted quadratic mean wqm function was found to provide a plausible assessment of the wq of coastal waters at reduced uncertainty levels the findings of this study also suggest that the unweighted root mean squared rms aggregation function could also be potentially used for assessment of coastal wq finally the wqm and rms models were found to exhibit a higher prediction accuracy and these wqi models could be effective and reliable tools to provide low uncertainty assessment of water quality status this research provides a robust statistically sound methodology for assessment of wqi model uncertainties a set of statistical tools in this method can be used to identify sources of uncertainty quantify them and evaluate their impact on the overall model performance therefore the finding of this research could aid a range of stakeholders including decision makers researchers and agencies responsible for water quality monitoring assessment and management the methodology was only tested for one domain application for its further improvement and validation it should be applied to various types of waterbodies declaration of competing interest

15206,as the most reactive and mobile fraction of black carbon dissolved black carbon dbc inexorably interacts with minerals in the biosphere nevertheless the research on the mechanisms and compositions of dbc assembly at the mineral water interface remains limited in this study we revealed the kinetic architecture of dbc on iron oxyhydroxide at novel insights based on quantitative and qualitative approaches the results indicated that high molecular weight highly unsaturated oxygen rich such as carboxyl rich fraction phenolics aliphatics and long c chains compounds were preferentially adsorbed on the iron oxyhydroxide 2d cos analyses directly disclosed the sequential fractionation aromatic and phenolic groups aliphatic groups and few aromatics were continuously adsorbed after the rapid adsorption quantitative determinations identified that aromatic and phenolic components were adsorbed rapidly over the first 60 min while aromatics achieved the dynamic equilibrium until 300 min which was consistent with the 2d cos observations our findings supported the hypothesis that mineral om and om om interactions worked simultaneously and the adsorption might be co driven by ligand exchange hydrophobic interactions and other mechanisms this work provided the theoretical basis for organic carbon storage and turnover and it was valuable for predicting the behaviors and fates of contaminants at the soil water interface and surface water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved black carbon iron oxyhydroxide molecular fractionation kinetic architecture data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction black carbon bc a typical product of incomplete combustion of fossil fuel and biomass is widely distributed in soils lakes rivers oceans and marine sediments liu and han 2021 as a kind of anthropogenic derived bc biochar has attracted considerable attention due to the large scale burning of agricultural waste and its extensive agricultural application luo et al 2019 mamera et al 2022 globally it is estimated that the quantity of bc produced by burning biomass 114 383 tg yr 1 is 1 2 orders of magnitude more than the amount produced from burning fossil fuels 2 29 tg yr 1 coppola et al 2019 qi et al 2020 according to a recent report only limited amounts of terrestrial bc discharge into the atmosphere with an estimated percentage of 90 bc remaining on site wagner et al 2019 once entering the soil environment the dissolved bc dbc which is the most reactive and mobile fraction of bc would release and participate in various environmental processes inevitably coppola et al 2018 huang et al 2021 dbc is a key and recalcitrant fraction of the natural dissolved organic matter nom pool which accounts for 10 of dissolved organic carbon of the global riverine flux to the oceans jaffe et al 2013 it involves numerous biogeochemical processes including global carbon cycle migration and transformation of contaminants and availability of nutrients understanding the geochemical behavior of dbc is therefore of great value necessarily in the biosphere the majority of the organic carbon oc 5410 6545 pgc occurs at solid earth interfaces and it will almost certainly come into contact with mineral surfaces at some point during the carbon cycle kleber et al 2021 interactions between the mineral and dissolved organic matter dom include sorption lv et al 2018 catalysis aldersley et al 2011 redox reactions trainer et al 2021 and generation of reactive oxygen species hall and silver 2013 which mainly depend on the characteristics of the mineral and organic phases iron oxyhydroxide owns large specific surface area variable surface charge and surface reactivity thus they can interact with different matters in the natural environment bao et al 2021 schwertmann and cornell 2008 previous investigations have proven that iron oxyhydroxide may serve as sorbents causing the molecular fractionation structure selective adsorption of dom kleber et al 2021 lv et al 2018 lv et al reported that the peat derived dom with higher molecular weights higher unsaturation levels and higher oxygen content such as polyphenols carboxylic components and polycyclic aromatics had the preferential adsorption on iron oxyhydroxides lv et al 2016 notably adsorption encompasses various fundamentally dynamic behavior rather than being static or irreversible with the assembly of dom molecules on the mineral surface exchange competition and diffusion reactions happen simultaneously kleber et al 2021 however there is still limited attention on the mechanism and makeup of dom assembly at the mineral water interface studies show the uncertainty of dom assemblage on mineral surface is closely related to its inherent chemical diversity coward et al 2018 genest et al 2014 compared to nom dbc possesses abundant active functional groups such as phenolic hydroxylic and carboxylic groups especially the condensed aromatic structures which would significantly affect the mechanism of adsorption moreover pyrolysis temperature is also confirmed to influence structures and components of dom in biochar distinctly sun et al 2021 to our knowledge the interactions between biochar derived dbc and minerals were little studied zhang et al examined the molecular fractionation phenomenon of biochar derived dbc on ferrihydrite considering that the oxygen containing functional groups and unsaturation level were the main parameters controlling the adsorption fractionation zhang et al 2020 the research on the details of dbc assembly at the mineral water interface was almost unnoticed in the previous study overall it is rather meaningful and necessary to explore the interaction between dbc and minerals especially the kinetic architecture of the adsorption of dbc at the mineral water interface recently the electrospray ionization fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry esi ft icr ms has deciphered dom at the molecular level and allows the detection of thousands of dom formulas dittmar and paeng 2009 zhang et al 2014 but the fly in the ointment is that the solid phase extraction and ionization efficiency are limited and thus partial molecular cannot be identified besides it is a non targeted and semi quantitative screening approach gonsior et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 and isomers for the same formula also cannot be distinguished seidel et al 2022 fluorescence spectroscopy and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir are common but rather valuable technologies that can characterize bulk dom quickly concisely and inexpensively especially combined with the two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos analysis they can recognize the subtle spectral response changes of dom during the adsorption to acquire reliable temporal sequence information of fluorescent substances and chemical structure besides benzenepolycarboxylic acids bpca method was a reliable molecular tracer technique for measuring condensed aromatic carbon conac in various environmental matrices bostick et al 2020 brodowski et al 2005 which was a great valuable approach for dbc characterization in this study 1 we characterize the composition variations of dbc before and after being adsorbed on iron oxyhydroxides by esi ft icr ms and pca analysis 2 we complementary analytical techniques were performed to recognize the dbc assembly on iron oxyhydroxide surface detailly including 2d cos generalized 2d cos moving window mw 2d cos and hetero 2d cos bpca analysis and folin ciocalteu method through these quantitative and qualitative analyses we aimed to reveal the sequential temporal molecular fractionation of dbc on iron oxyhydroxide at novel insights 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of dbc samples and iron oxyhydroxides two different pyrolysis temperatures derived biochar were prepared to obtain dbc in this work specific information and steps of the extraction of dbc were shown in text s1 dbc extracted from different pyrolysis temperatures derived biochar 300 c and 500 c were marked as dbc3 and dbc5 respectively molecular diversity and the different adsorption behavior on iron oxyhydroxides surface of dbc3 and dbc5 would be examined goethite was purchased from sigma aldrich cas 20344 49 4 ferrihydrite was synthesized according to previous publications schwertmann and cornell 2008 specific steps were shown in text s2 goethite gt and ferrihydrite fh were chosen as the test minerals because they were common and representative iron oxyhydroxides the morphology images of prepared dbc samples and iron oxyhydroxides were summarized in fig s1 2 2 sorption experiments batch kinetic sorption experiments of dbc both the doc concentration of dbc3 and dbc5 were 10 mgc l 1 on iron oxyhydroxides both ferrihydrite and goethite were controlled at 1 g l 1 were conducted for 0 5 15 30 60 120 300 480 1200 2400 min intervals respectively without background electrolyte on a reciprocating shaker at 150 rpm at room temperature 25 c in dark coward et al 2018 no other ph adjustments were made during the experiments after adjusting the origin ph to about 7 lv et al 2018 the suspensions of every interval were filtered through 0 22 μm filters the doc concentration was determined at each time point to plot the adsorption kinetic curves fig s2a supernatants of dbc3 after adsorbing by gt fh were marked as dbc3g and dbc3f respectively and the dbc5 supernatants after adsorbing on gt fh were named as dbc5g and dbc5f respectively 2 3 spectroscopic measurements and 2d cos analysis synchronous fluorescence spectra of dbc samples were determined by a fluorescence spectrophotometer cary eclipse agilent technologies usa the scans were tested over a range from 250 to 550 nm and the constant offset δλ was set at 60 nm fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nexus 670 thermo nicolet usa was used to identify functional groups of original iron oxyhydroxides and freeze dried iron oxyhydroxide dbc complexes it was important to note that different from supernatant samples these iron oxyhydroxide dbc complexes were marked as fh dbc3 fh dbc5 gt dbc3 and gt dbc5 respectively to distinguish the sequential information on the variation of structures and components of dbc during the adsorption taking sorption time as the external perturbation 2d sfs cos mw 2d sfs cos 2d ftir cos mw2d ftir cos and 2d sfs ftir heterocos were produced via 2d shige software kwansei gakuin university japan and analyzed depending on noda s rule noda and ozaki 2005 in addition principal component analysis pca was conducted based on several optical parameters text s3 2 4 esi ft icr ms analysis dbc3 dbc5 and the equilibrium solution of dbc3g dbc3f dbc5g and dbc5f were chosen for ft icr ms analyses the acidified dbc solutions ph 2 were desalinated and concentrated via solid phase extraction cartridges agilent bond elut ppl 1 g 6 ml and then the spe dbc was eluted with methanol lc ms grade for subsequent determination samples were analyzed with a 9 4t solarix ft icr ms bruker germany equipped with negative ion mode electrospray ionization esi under the needle voltage of 3 5 kv the acquisition and processing of ft icr ms data and the calculation of h c o c xc modified aromaticity index aimod van krevelen diagrams kendrick mass defect kmd and intensity averaged parameters were shown in text s4 2 5 benzenepolycarboxylic acid method and folin ciocalteu method the structure of conac could be converted into benzenepolycarboxylic acids bpca by nitric acid under high temperature and pressure conditions detailed steps could reference the method proposed by dittmar and stubbins dittmar 2008 stubbins et al 2015 the concentrations of oxidative products 1 2 3 b3ca 1 2 4 b3ca 1 3 5 b3ca 1 2 4 5 b4ca b5ca b6ca were used to quantify the conac and the molar mass ratio of b6ca b5ca to b4ca b3ca could indicate the polycondensation degree of conac higher values meant more condensed aromatic conac besides the total phenolic contents were determined by folin ciocalteu method according to the former method wang et al 2021 all the chemicals and reagents used during the experiments were mentioned in the text s5 3 results 3 1 determination of dbc molecular compositions diversity by ft icr ms esi ft icr ms was employed to investigate the diversity of molecular compositions of original dbc3 and dbc5 the aimod and h c were combined to classify every detected molecule formula in four groups and the van krevelen diagrams and violin plots with box plots were demonstrated in fig 1 a h respectively they could visually display the chemical class distribution of dbc d andrilli et al 2015 song et al 2021 as shown in fig 1a b it was observed that the mass range of molecular formulas in dbc was mainly distributed in a relatively low range 750 da which liked the forest derived charcoal leachate and rice straw derived dbc in former studies hockaday et al 2007 song et al 2021 furthermore for combustion derived polycyclic aromatics compounds dbc3 was distributed in molecules 500 da while a portion of the molecular formulas in dbc5 were larger than 500 da meanwhile it was found that the pyrolysis process was accompanied by the loss of higher molecular weight fractions which were mainly distributed in aliphatic compounds highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds and vascular plant derived polyphenols these phenomena were consistent with the previous report that the high temperature pyrolysis would lead to the degradation or transformation of aliphatic carbon and unstable organic matters and they might proceed with the aromatization process which formed condensed aromatic and graphitic type structures gradually dittmar et al 2012 sun et al 2021 wagner et al 2021 the pyrolysis of biochar underwent various reactions and produced a continuum of organic substances which enhanced the heterogeneity between dbc samples and change their environmental behavior besides the shape of the violin diagrams of the four groups was similar which was linked to their similar structures such as aromatic ring structures of polyphenols or polycyclic aromatics with aliphatic chains song et al 2021 the van krevelen diagrams fig 1e h were expressed in the form of color mapped bubble plots which could represent the relative abundance of different molecular formulas directly as shown in fig 1e f the chemodiversity of dbc molecular formulas showed quite different nature when compared to freshwater or estuarine dom in van krevelen space van krevelen 1950 in addition there were relatively obvious differences when compared to the dbc samples raised by other literature reports qu et al 2016 song et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 these differences were mostly due to the various feedstock sources and production conditions overall the main compound classes in dbc3 and dbc5 were rather distinct major assigned formulas of dbc3 had relatively high h c ratios 1 1 5 and dbc3 was mainly constituted by highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds comparatively low h c species increased significantly in dbc5 and abundant combustion derived polycyclic aromatics and vascular plant derived polyphenols were distributed here as the pyrolysis continued the characteristic of black carbon that was rich in carbon and poor in hydrogen condensed aromatic structures became more noticeable kim et al 2004 molecular formulas containing n ie chon subgroups also showed a similar phenomenon signifying that more nitrogen containing aromatic rings might present in dbc5 e g pyrroles with aliphatic side chains compared to dbc3 gonsior et al 2019 xc c diagrams the representation of the aromaticity equivalent were utilized to differentiate compounds with varying degrees of unsaturation yassine et al 2014 as illustrated in fig 2 it was evident that dbc5 compare to dbc3 contained more unsaturated bonds and greater aromaticity this was proven by the rapid increase in xc when at c11 23 for instance the xc of most formulas in dbc5 were increased to 2 8 at carbon number 15 while the corresponding values of dbc3 were distributed in 2 7 these variations imputed to the monomers polymerization and aromatization over the pyrolysis the composition of the cho species the largest percentage of the subgroup across whole the formulas was investigated by kmd analysis in short the homologous series with identical repeat functional groups such as ch2 and coo could be analyzed by kmd plots bahureksa et al 2021 sleighter and hatcher 2007 as shown in fig 3 homologous series that only varied in the number of series displayed the same kmd value and lay on the same horizontal line apparently compared to the kmd ch2 plot of dbc5 dbc3 owned more long chain compounds tao et al 2014 which was likely due to the cracking of the long chain molecules during the pyrolysis process because dbc has relatively high content of carboxylic groups qu et al 2016 kmd coo analysis for cho species was also performed in this study compared to the dbc5 the kmd coo layout of dbc3 was distributed in a wider range especially the low region kmd 0 3 generally the number of c and h and the value of h c increased with the absolute value of kmd coo increased in the vertical direction implying that dbc3 contained more saturated molecules with carboxyl groups kmd analysis provided potential and valuable information about the structures of dbc via subtle molecular differences besides more details about the dbc molecular compositions diversity that were tested by ft icr ms were elaborated in text s6 3 2 the adsorption fractionation of dbc on fh gt for ox and oxny subgroups figs s4 and s5 detected by ft icr ms when compare to dbc3 it could be clearly observed that there were more compounds with fewer o atoms in dbc3g and dbc3f especially in the latter proving that the compounds rich in oxygen were more preferably retained on the mineral surface during adsorption in xc c diagrams fig 2 more formulas exposed strong abundance at the lower xc values than original dbc3 samples which represented the preferential adsorption of higher xc components while the lower ones were maintained in the aqueous phase preferentially this indicated the vital role of high unsaturation compounds in the adsorption process likewise fh showed stronger selective adsorption property van krevelen diagrams and corresponding violin plots of dbc3g and dbc3f were demonstrated in fig 1 the characteristics of dbc supernatant after adsorption were rather similar to the initial sample nevertheless partial high molecular weight phenolics and highly unsaturated compounds disappeared after adsorption this was in accordance with the previous reports that the molecular with higher m z was more possible to adsorb on gt fh li et al 2022 additionally the formulas of aliphatic compounds with high molecular weight were also lost preferentially remained aliphatic fractions on iron oxyhydroxides were also detected in former studies genest et al 2014 lv et al 2016 from the kmd ch2 layouts of cho species fig 3 high molecular weight components with long c chains were evidently favorably kept on gt fh besides the molecular formulas in the upper right corner of the kmd coo diagram disappeared after being adsorbed on fh gt suggesting the preferential adsorption of rich carboxyl group components in unsaturated molecules in the lower right corner the formulas represented saturated molecules with carboxyl groups o 10 18 were lost both on fh gt adsorption and dbc3g displayed similar but inconspicuous phenomena additionally owning to the adsorption preferences results of the dbc5 were similar to that of dbc3 the analyses of dbc5 dbc5g and dbc5f were briefly shown in text s7 furthermore pca analysis was performed for a series of intensive time sampling sequence of each group based on various optical parameters feng et al 2021 to evaluate the difference between the adsorption processes as shown in fig s7 two principal components pcs were extracted explaining 79 44 of the total variance of the dataset dbc3 and dbc5 owned varying degrees of separation between dbc before and after adsorption proofing that dbc from low pyrolyzed temperature might had a stronger affinity to gt and fh besides dbc adsorbed by gt plotted more gathered features while the samples separated distinctly in the plot after being adsorbed by fh these indicated that the weakly crystalline fh had better adsorption properties to dbc 3 3 investigation of the temporal molecular fractionation 3 3 1 2d sfs cos analyses to examine the adsorption characteristics of fluorescent components induced by iron oxyhydroxides synchronous fluorescence spectra of dbc supernatant with various adsorption time points were measured and the 2d sfs cos were produced based on the former research fluorescent signals might be divided into three parts regions that are protein like 250 310 nm fulvic like 310 380 nm and humic like regions 380 600 nm respectively guo et al 2022 hur and lee 2011 as shown in fig s8a b four auto peaks were identified by the synchronous map of dbc3g including peaks at 378 nm and 346 nm and two weak peaks at 366 nm and 396 nm suggesting the fulvic like compounds were extremely susceptible during the adsorption followed by humic like regions for the synchronous map of dbc3f auto peak at 358 nm was the only peak observed which meant the fulvic like matters had absolute priority during the adsorption of dbc3 on fh dbc5g and dbc5f exhibited similar forms of synchronous map distribution fig s8c d auto peaks at 328 and 342 nm intimated the preferential adsorption of fulvic like components for each synchronous map all the cross peaks were positive evincing that the fluorophores variations followed the same direction li et al 2020 the asynchronous maps supplied extra details regarding the order of the spectral origins during adsorption fig s8e h displayed the asynchronous maps and table s1 listed the detailed assignments of the peaks and signs of the cross peaks taking dbc3f as an example results showed these various cross peaks were positive and negative within the same region hinting that the sequential changes not only related to the type of fluorescent substance but also more to the types number and exposure of functional groups in the fluorescent components li et al 2020 xu et al 2018 in addition it seemed that the dbc3 exhibited more reactive functional groups compared to dbc5 guo et al also reported that biochar derived dom at a 300 c pyrolysis temperature displayed more ligands than those at 500 c and 700 c when interacting with cu ii guo et al 2022 compared with generalized 2d cos mw2d cos not only provided information along the spectral variable direction but information along the perturbation variable direction was visually captured the results of mw2d sfs cos synchronous maps fig s8i l demonstrated the peaks mostly gathered in the region of fulvic like compounds the fluorescent fractions were mainly adsorbed over the first 1 h and few fluorescent substances might be adsorbed during 1 2 h 3 3 2 analyses of ftir with 2d cos and mw2d cos 2d ftir cos and mw2d ftir cos were employed to analyze the region of 1800 600 cm 1 chen et al 2015 liu et al 2017 where the most valuable information about dbc structures appeared the ftir spectra of the original mineral and the gt fh dbc complexes sampled at various adsorption time points were determined for fh dbc3 and fh dbc5 the synchronous maps fig 4 a b exhibited four predominant auto peaks at 1620 1380 and 690 1000 cm 1 the peaks at 1620 1380 and 600 1000 cm 1 were demonstrated to change significantly which were attributed to cc stretching of aromatic rings co stretching and oh deformation of phenolic groups and one to four adjacent h deformations of aromatic nucleus ch respectively chen et al 2015 dun et al 2013 li et al 2021a suggesting the abundant phenolics and condensed aromatic compounds in dbc were adsorbed it was in line with the observation of ft icr ms in comparison the synchronous maps for gt dbc3 and gt dbc5 exposed entirely different results fig 4c d the peaks at 690 1000 cm 1 could both be observed implying the aromatic compounds were a distinctive component and had absolute superiority during the adsorption process additionally most of the peaks at the cross peaks were almost positive and just a few negative in synchronous maps which might connote the dynamic adsorption process of certain functional groups on iron oxyhydroxides tables 1 and s2 showed the detailed information of the cross peaks in the asynchronous maps fig 4e h in dbc iron oxyhydroxide systems to elaborate the sequential structures fractionation directly according to noda s role the sequential order of structural affinities of the adsorption of dbc on fh could be concluded as follow for fh dbc3 the order was 1380 690 1000 1620 690 1000 1150 690 1000 cm 1 which was corresponded to the order that phenolics aromatics aliphatics aromatics for fh dbc5 the order was 690 1000 1620 1380 1150 690 1000 cm 1 representing the order that aromatics phenolics aromatics aliphatics moreover the order of gt dbc3 was 690 1000 1620 1380 cm 1 which showed the order that aromatic compounds phenolics in gt dbc5 system the order was 1620 690 1000 1380 cm 1 demonstrating the order that aromatics phenolics aliphatic it should be noted that the region of 690 1000 cm 1 contained different peaks that represented the aromatic nucleus ch with different adjacent h deformations and thus 1 more than once occurrence of 690 1000 cm 1 in the same sequence and 2 the meant both positive and negative peaks were present in the region which was corresponded to the in table 1 overall these findings manifested the same feature that the aromatic or and phenolic groups were preferentially adsorbed and then the aliphatic groups besides a small amount of sustained adsorption of aromatic compounds might be present here synchronous maps of mw2d ftir cos provided a clear insight into the temporal adsorption of functional groups by taking the adsorption time as an external disturbance as illustrated in fig 4i l three peaks at around 690 1000 1380 and 1620 cm 1 were discovered in both fh dbc3 and fh dbc5 suggesting the aromatic and phenolic compounds had the absolute adsorption advantage and mostly adsorbed over the first 60 min however for gt there was only one obvious peak at 690 1000 cm 1 that was ascribed to aromatic groups importantly the information of y coordinates of all synchronous maps implied aromatic group was likely adsorbed on iron oxyhydroxides continuously after the 60 min rapid process li et al 2021a zhou et al 2019 2d sfs ftir heterocos analysis were conducted fig s9 to verify the correlation between the sfs and ftir spectra text s8 3 3 3 determination of conac and phenols based on the sequential information got from 2d cos analyses bpca method folin ciocalteu method and a 254 parameters were further used to quantify the amount of the conac phenolics and aromatics respectively the conac concentrations in dbc solutions were estimated following dittmar 2008 dittmar 2008 as shown in fig 5 a a significant drop in the first 5 min and the majority of losses occurred within the first 120 min the absorbed conac on minerals over 300 min ranged from about 30 to 82 indication of bpcas distribution further clarified that selective adsorption was also connected with the degree of aromatic condensation of conac fig s10 whether dbc3 or dbc5 the polycondensation degree decreased during the adsorption on gt or fh and it was demonstrated that compounds with higher condensation would be preferentially adsorbed in order to confirm the adsorption properties of the aromatic moiety the parameters of a 254 were applied to fit adsorption kinetic curves fig s2b similar to the conac based adsorption behaviors the fast adsorption showed in the first 1 h and reached dynamic equilibrium at the initial 2 5 h phenolic substances were determined by folin ciocalteu method fig 5b the results signified that the adsorption curves of phenols occurred mostly in the initial 60 min whatever the type of dbc or iron oxyhydroxides remarkably such adsorption was detectable after only 5 min of exposure which was in accord with the conac and aromatics in general these determinations agreed with the 2d cos analyses and further supplied credible data support furthermore it was worth mentioning that we found that the value of conac for dbc5 2 911 mgc l 1 was about 5 5 times higher than that of dbc3 0 527 mgc l 1 and accounts for approximately 30 of the doc concentration representing the significance of pyrolysis temperature during the preparation and the uniqueness of conac structures in dbc sample 4 discussion studies had previously indicated the mechanisms of the adsorption of dom on iron oxyhydroxide surface including electrostatic interaction ligand exchange hydrophobic interaction hydrogen bonding van der waals forces and cation bridging it had been researched that ligand exchange was the dominant mechanism for the adsorption of dom onto fe oxyhydroxides bao et al 2021 kleber et al 2021 ligand exchange refers to the functional groups such as cooh and oh from dom form the inner sphere complexation with the surface hydroxylated groups of iron oxyhydroxides lv et al 2016 according to a 254 conac phenolics results rapid initial adsorption occurred to conac aromatics and phenolics at the first 60 min of dbc exposure at each exposure time point the percentages of the removal ratios were nearly larger than the nonselective sorption percentage predicted based on the doc concentration confirming the preferential adsorption of these compounds fig s11 both phenolics and the high condensation fraction in aromatics conac showed relatively stronger adsorption capacity on iron oxyhydroxides surface greater affinities of aromatic and phenolic compounds on the mineral surface were also detected by ft icr ms in previous studies these compounds were likely to be involved in ligand exchange and formed the inner sphere complexation notably a former study that depended on ft icr ms did not observe the fast adsorption of conac compounds at the initial 5 min by ft icr ms coward et al 2018 combined with our results this might be attributed to the dynamic adsorption desorption process or either outcompeted initially by less substituted aromatic compounds not the steric hindrances high selective during the adsorption of the condensation conac could also prove it with the cumulative concentration of doc adsorbed on mineral increased consistently surface hydroxyl sites in gt fh were gradually occupied when these direct mineral organic matter om interactions were weakened several studies considered that the om om interactions were present potentially kleber et al 2021 mitchell and simpson 2013 zang et al 2000 chen et al also raised legacy effects which considered that the retention of highly sorptive organic molecules on minerals decreased the reactive site availability of mineral surface where the om om interactions theoretically played a vital role chen et al 2022b briefly as minerals reactive surface functional groups gradually reached saturation later loadings of dom might include a co action of mineral om and om om interactions rather than single mineral om interaction as initial consequently a mineral particle might be coated with several om layers and finally form om mineral complexes remarkably it seemed that our kinetic architecture results fit this mechanism in detail according to our ft icr ms and 2d ftir cos results after the fast adsorption stage of aromatics and phenolics the aliphatic compounds and components with long c chains were proved to be adsorbed on the mineral surface these might be ascribed to the interactions between aliphatic compounds or fatty carbon chains in dbc supernatant and the adsorbed dbc structures similar results had been reported previously for example by batch chemical oxidation experiments clemente and simpson found that coating lignin clay complexes with dodecanoic acid one of the long chain aliphatic compounds could resist naclo2 oxidation and protect lignin from chemical oxidation in which the hydrophobic interactions between om om might be responsible for it clemente and simpson 2013 thevenot et al used a physicochemical soil lignin isolation procedure and proposed that the aliphatic aromatic interactions such as lignin lipids interactions could be a chemical pathway of lignin stabilization thevenot et al 2013 more visually genest et al analyzed the signals of the samples in dmso d6 a highly penetrating solvent that can penetrate into the hydrophobic domains and provide information on hydrophobic structures which recognized that aromatic moieties were protected within hydrophobic regions genest et al 2014 additionally π π eda interactions between the aromatic rings could drive the aromatic aromatic associations chen et al 2022a these mechanisms might explain the sluggish adsorption of aromatic molecules on iron oxyhydroxide after the fast adsorption which could observe by both mw2d ftir cos and bpca determination the difference between the adsorption efficiency of four groups dbc3g dbc3f dbc5g and dbc5f should be clarified on the one hand from the ft icr ms more aliphatic components hydrophilic phenolics and carboxyl groups were noticed in dbc3 while more low h c and aromatic groups were found in dbc5 dbc from lower pyrolysis temperature derived biochar had better adsorption behavior on iron oxyhydroxide surface which were co driven by various mechanisms possibly however c fe ratios ph ionic strength and other influence factors were not considered in our study so it might not be a universal rule intriguingly it needs to point out that the effect of mineral fractionation on dbc molecular heterogeneity was much less than the effect of pyrolysis temperature according to our ft icr ms analyses suggesting that the pyrolysis temperatures would still be the key factors to study the environmental behavior of dbc on the other hand based on the pca analysis and the ft icr ms results it was obvious that the fh with a poorly crystalline form facilitated the adsorption of organic substances more than goethite α feooh due to the higher surface area and more surface hydroxyl groups huang et al established that the principal adsorptive sites for dom were provided by the iron containing soil minerals by comparing the molecular fractionation of dom on soil with iron oxides removed nsio2 montmorillonite and fe rich montmorillonite huang et al 2019 in natural environment fh is thought of as a youthful fe oxyhydroxide and it exists in lakes streams and hydromorphic soils i e environments where oxidizing and reducing conditions alternate and hence an active iron turnover exists in comparison gt is one of the most pervasive fe oxyhydroxides in the environment because it is thermodynamically stable fe oxyhydroxide under aerobic surface conditions schwertmann and cornell 2008 different environmental conditions lead to the predominance of different types of iron oxyhydroxides which would alter the preservation of organic carbon therefore the study of the iron oxyhydroxide s preservation for dbc the labile and widespread organic carbon pool was rather significant in this study ft icr ms analyses revealed the molecular fractionation properties of dbc on gt fh 2d ftir cos analyses provided direct sequential fractionation evidence during the adsorption from our results although this approach could not provide information at the molecular level it was a rather valid convenient and easily attainable way compared to ft icr ms depending on above findings we further determined the conac phenolics and aromatics compounds via quantitative chemical methods and spectroscopic means which offered the temporal sequence intuitively our results showed the components with high adsorption affinity on iron oxyhydroxide surface in dbc were similar to the other types of dom lv et al 2018 2016 zhang et al 2020 interestingly different from the three isolated stages zonal assembly models of soil derived dom on goethite examined by ft icr ms coward et al 2018 fast adsorption of both aromatics and phenolics in the initial 60 min were determined in our study which benefited from the quantitative research remarkably although aliphatic compounds cannot be quantified we considered that the preferential adsorption of aliphatic fractions was the evidence that supported the om layering mechanism very likely and the hydrophobic zones might be formed here coward et al 2018 genest et al 2014 sollins et al 2006 information on the interaction between dbc and iron oxyhydroxide surface was of utmost necessity for predicting the behaviors and fates of nutrients and contaminants in aquatic environments for the molecular fractionation at the mineral water interface li et al confirmed the om components that had higher affinities to fh showed lower biodegradability by employing the aerobic biodegradation assay while the compounds having lower affinities to fh displayed higher biodegradability li et al 2021b it was proposed that the altered reactivity of ha during its fractionation on fh would influence the kinetic behavior of heavy metals in the solution ding et al 2019 wang et al also reported the interfacial molecular fractionation of dom on fh greatly reduces the photoproduction of reactive oxygen species ros of supernatant wang et al 2021 the condensation degree of the aromatic compounds in dbc was also closely related to the photolytic properties fang et al 2017 which decreased with the adsorption in our work in these processes the kinetic architecture of mineral bound om is critical in these process in fact because it could change the fractionated dom fractions that release into the aquatic environment directly also the compounds located beneath surface layer of om that are inaccessible by water may be protected from degradation by more polar compounds and become more stable clemente and simpson 2013 genest et al 2014 in summary the layering and architecture of dbc changed the chemical components of dbc and the surface chemistry of minerals and it affected the storage and stability of organic carbon from micrometer to ecosystem scales 5 conclusion in this work we implemented complementary analytical approaches including ft icr ms 2d sfs cos 2d ftir cos bpca analyses and the folin ciocalteu method to characterize the adsorption of dbc at iron oxyhydroxide water interface especially the sequential properties we came to the following conclusions 1 ft icr ms results illustrated that the high molecular weight compounds high unsaturation compounds oxygen rich molecules such as carboxy rich compounds and phenolics aliphatics and fractions with long c chains were more preferably retained on the minerals 2 the fulvic like fractions contained carboxylic phenolic and aromatic groups were noticed to maintain on the iron oxyhydroxide surface preferentially and the sequential fractionation of dbc on iron oxyhydroxide aromatic and phenolic groups aliphatic groups 3 the aromatic compounds with higher condensation would be preferentially adsorbed and few aromatic fractions were found to be continuously adsorbed after the initial fast adsorption 4 dbc from various pyrolysis temperature derived biochar had different adsorption behavior on the iron oxyhydroxide which were relevant to the chemical components besides various forms of iron oxyhydroxides in different environmental settings would alter the preservation of organic carbon overall our findings were consistent with the hypothesis that the loadings of dom on iron oxyhydroxide might include the co driven of mineral om and om om interactions rather than single mineral om interaction these results supported the zonal assembly and hydrophobic zones theories this work was expected to enhance the understanding of the adsorptive fractionation and its temporal sequence of dbc on iron oxyhydroxide which was of special value for elucidating stabilization and mobility mechanisms for organic carbon in the soil water environment as well as for the environmental behavior and effect of contaminants declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

15206,as the most reactive and mobile fraction of black carbon dissolved black carbon dbc inexorably interacts with minerals in the biosphere nevertheless the research on the mechanisms and compositions of dbc assembly at the mineral water interface remains limited in this study we revealed the kinetic architecture of dbc on iron oxyhydroxide at novel insights based on quantitative and qualitative approaches the results indicated that high molecular weight highly unsaturated oxygen rich such as carboxyl rich fraction phenolics aliphatics and long c chains compounds were preferentially adsorbed on the iron oxyhydroxide 2d cos analyses directly disclosed the sequential fractionation aromatic and phenolic groups aliphatic groups and few aromatics were continuously adsorbed after the rapid adsorption quantitative determinations identified that aromatic and phenolic components were adsorbed rapidly over the first 60 min while aromatics achieved the dynamic equilibrium until 300 min which was consistent with the 2d cos observations our findings supported the hypothesis that mineral om and om om interactions worked simultaneously and the adsorption might be co driven by ligand exchange hydrophobic interactions and other mechanisms this work provided the theoretical basis for organic carbon storage and turnover and it was valuable for predicting the behaviors and fates of contaminants at the soil water interface and surface water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved black carbon iron oxyhydroxide molecular fractionation kinetic architecture data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction black carbon bc a typical product of incomplete combustion of fossil fuel and biomass is widely distributed in soils lakes rivers oceans and marine sediments liu and han 2021 as a kind of anthropogenic derived bc biochar has attracted considerable attention due to the large scale burning of agricultural waste and its extensive agricultural application luo et al 2019 mamera et al 2022 globally it is estimated that the quantity of bc produced by burning biomass 114 383 tg yr 1 is 1 2 orders of magnitude more than the amount produced from burning fossil fuels 2 29 tg yr 1 coppola et al 2019 qi et al 2020 according to a recent report only limited amounts of terrestrial bc discharge into the atmosphere with an estimated percentage of 90 bc remaining on site wagner et al 2019 once entering the soil environment the dissolved bc dbc which is the most reactive and mobile fraction of bc would release and participate in various environmental processes inevitably coppola et al 2018 huang et al 2021 dbc is a key and recalcitrant fraction of the natural dissolved organic matter nom pool which accounts for 10 of dissolved organic carbon of the global riverine flux to the oceans jaffe et al 2013 it involves numerous biogeochemical processes including global carbon cycle migration and transformation of contaminants and availability of nutrients understanding the geochemical behavior of dbc is therefore of great value necessarily in the biosphere the majority of the organic carbon oc 5410 6545 pgc occurs at solid earth interfaces and it will almost certainly come into contact with mineral surfaces at some point during the carbon cycle kleber et al 2021 interactions between the mineral and dissolved organic matter dom include sorption lv et al 2018 catalysis aldersley et al 2011 redox reactions trainer et al 2021 and generation of reactive oxygen species hall and silver 2013 which mainly depend on the characteristics of the mineral and organic phases iron oxyhydroxide owns large specific surface area variable surface charge and surface reactivity thus they can interact with different matters in the natural environment bao et al 2021 schwertmann and cornell 2008 previous investigations have proven that iron oxyhydroxide may serve as sorbents causing the molecular fractionation structure selective adsorption of dom kleber et al 2021 lv et al 2018 lv et al reported that the peat derived dom with higher molecular weights higher unsaturation levels and higher oxygen content such as polyphenols carboxylic components and polycyclic aromatics had the preferential adsorption on iron oxyhydroxides lv et al 2016 notably adsorption encompasses various fundamentally dynamic behavior rather than being static or irreversible with the assembly of dom molecules on the mineral surface exchange competition and diffusion reactions happen simultaneously kleber et al 2021 however there is still limited attention on the mechanism and makeup of dom assembly at the mineral water interface studies show the uncertainty of dom assemblage on mineral surface is closely related to its inherent chemical diversity coward et al 2018 genest et al 2014 compared to nom dbc possesses abundant active functional groups such as phenolic hydroxylic and carboxylic groups especially the condensed aromatic structures which would significantly affect the mechanism of adsorption moreover pyrolysis temperature is also confirmed to influence structures and components of dom in biochar distinctly sun et al 2021 to our knowledge the interactions between biochar derived dbc and minerals were little studied zhang et al examined the molecular fractionation phenomenon of biochar derived dbc on ferrihydrite considering that the oxygen containing functional groups and unsaturation level were the main parameters controlling the adsorption fractionation zhang et al 2020 the research on the details of dbc assembly at the mineral water interface was almost unnoticed in the previous study overall it is rather meaningful and necessary to explore the interaction between dbc and minerals especially the kinetic architecture of the adsorption of dbc at the mineral water interface recently the electrospray ionization fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry esi ft icr ms has deciphered dom at the molecular level and allows the detection of thousands of dom formulas dittmar and paeng 2009 zhang et al 2014 but the fly in the ointment is that the solid phase extraction and ionization efficiency are limited and thus partial molecular cannot be identified besides it is a non targeted and semi quantitative screening approach gonsior et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 and isomers for the same formula also cannot be distinguished seidel et al 2022 fluorescence spectroscopy and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir are common but rather valuable technologies that can characterize bulk dom quickly concisely and inexpensively especially combined with the two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos analysis they can recognize the subtle spectral response changes of dom during the adsorption to acquire reliable temporal sequence information of fluorescent substances and chemical structure besides benzenepolycarboxylic acids bpca method was a reliable molecular tracer technique for measuring condensed aromatic carbon conac in various environmental matrices bostick et al 2020 brodowski et al 2005 which was a great valuable approach for dbc characterization in this study 1 we characterize the composition variations of dbc before and after being adsorbed on iron oxyhydroxides by esi ft icr ms and pca analysis 2 we complementary analytical techniques were performed to recognize the dbc assembly on iron oxyhydroxide surface detailly including 2d cos generalized 2d cos moving window mw 2d cos and hetero 2d cos bpca analysis and folin ciocalteu method through these quantitative and qualitative analyses we aimed to reveal the sequential temporal molecular fractionation of dbc on iron oxyhydroxide at novel insights 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of dbc samples and iron oxyhydroxides two different pyrolysis temperatures derived biochar were prepared to obtain dbc in this work specific information and steps of the extraction of dbc were shown in text s1 dbc extracted from different pyrolysis temperatures derived biochar 300 c and 500 c were marked as dbc3 and dbc5 respectively molecular diversity and the different adsorption behavior on iron oxyhydroxides surface of dbc3 and dbc5 would be examined goethite was purchased from sigma aldrich cas 20344 49 4 ferrihydrite was synthesized according to previous publications schwertmann and cornell 2008 specific steps were shown in text s2 goethite gt and ferrihydrite fh were chosen as the test minerals because they were common and representative iron oxyhydroxides the morphology images of prepared dbc samples and iron oxyhydroxides were summarized in fig s1 2 2 sorption experiments batch kinetic sorption experiments of dbc both the doc concentration of dbc3 and dbc5 were 10 mgc l 1 on iron oxyhydroxides both ferrihydrite and goethite were controlled at 1 g l 1 were conducted for 0 5 15 30 60 120 300 480 1200 2400 min intervals respectively without background electrolyte on a reciprocating shaker at 150 rpm at room temperature 25 c in dark coward et al 2018 no other ph adjustments were made during the experiments after adjusting the origin ph to about 7 lv et al 2018 the suspensions of every interval were filtered through 0 22 μm filters the doc concentration was determined at each time point to plot the adsorption kinetic curves fig s2a supernatants of dbc3 after adsorbing by gt fh were marked as dbc3g and dbc3f respectively and the dbc5 supernatants after adsorbing on gt fh were named as dbc5g and dbc5f respectively 2 3 spectroscopic measurements and 2d cos analysis synchronous fluorescence spectra of dbc samples were determined by a fluorescence spectrophotometer cary eclipse agilent technologies usa the scans were tested over a range from 250 to 550 nm and the constant offset δλ was set at 60 nm fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nexus 670 thermo nicolet usa was used to identify functional groups of original iron oxyhydroxides and freeze dried iron oxyhydroxide dbc complexes it was important to note that different from supernatant samples these iron oxyhydroxide dbc complexes were marked as fh dbc3 fh dbc5 gt dbc3 and gt dbc5 respectively to distinguish the sequential information on the variation of structures and components of dbc during the adsorption taking sorption time as the external perturbation 2d sfs cos mw 2d sfs cos 2d ftir cos mw2d ftir cos and 2d sfs ftir heterocos were produced via 2d shige software kwansei gakuin university japan and analyzed depending on noda s rule noda and ozaki 2005 in addition principal component analysis pca was conducted based on several optical parameters text s3 2 4 esi ft icr ms analysis dbc3 dbc5 and the equilibrium solution of dbc3g dbc3f dbc5g and dbc5f were chosen for ft icr ms analyses the acidified dbc solutions ph 2 were desalinated and concentrated via solid phase extraction cartridges agilent bond elut ppl 1 g 6 ml and then the spe dbc was eluted with methanol lc ms grade for subsequent determination samples were analyzed with a 9 4t solarix ft icr ms bruker germany equipped with negative ion mode electrospray ionization esi under the needle voltage of 3 5 kv the acquisition and processing of ft icr ms data and the calculation of h c o c xc modified aromaticity index aimod van krevelen diagrams kendrick mass defect kmd and intensity averaged parameters were shown in text s4 2 5 benzenepolycarboxylic acid method and folin ciocalteu method the structure of conac could be converted into benzenepolycarboxylic acids bpca by nitric acid under high temperature and pressure conditions detailed steps could reference the method proposed by dittmar and stubbins dittmar 2008 stubbins et al 2015 the concentrations of oxidative products 1 2 3 b3ca 1 2 4 b3ca 1 3 5 b3ca 1 2 4 5 b4ca b5ca b6ca were used to quantify the conac and the molar mass ratio of b6ca b5ca to b4ca b3ca could indicate the polycondensation degree of conac higher values meant more condensed aromatic conac besides the total phenolic contents were determined by folin ciocalteu method according to the former method wang et al 2021 all the chemicals and reagents used during the experiments were mentioned in the text s5 3 results 3 1 determination of dbc molecular compositions diversity by ft icr ms esi ft icr ms was employed to investigate the diversity of molecular compositions of original dbc3 and dbc5 the aimod and h c were combined to classify every detected molecule formula in four groups and the van krevelen diagrams and violin plots with box plots were demonstrated in fig 1 a h respectively they could visually display the chemical class distribution of dbc d andrilli et al 2015 song et al 2021 as shown in fig 1a b it was observed that the mass range of molecular formulas in dbc was mainly distributed in a relatively low range 750 da which liked the forest derived charcoal leachate and rice straw derived dbc in former studies hockaday et al 2007 song et al 2021 furthermore for combustion derived polycyclic aromatics compounds dbc3 was distributed in molecules 500 da while a portion of the molecular formulas in dbc5 were larger than 500 da meanwhile it was found that the pyrolysis process was accompanied by the loss of higher molecular weight fractions which were mainly distributed in aliphatic compounds highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds and vascular plant derived polyphenols these phenomena were consistent with the previous report that the high temperature pyrolysis would lead to the degradation or transformation of aliphatic carbon and unstable organic matters and they might proceed with the aromatization process which formed condensed aromatic and graphitic type structures gradually dittmar et al 2012 sun et al 2021 wagner et al 2021 the pyrolysis of biochar underwent various reactions and produced a continuum of organic substances which enhanced the heterogeneity between dbc samples and change their environmental behavior besides the shape of the violin diagrams of the four groups was similar which was linked to their similar structures such as aromatic ring structures of polyphenols or polycyclic aromatics with aliphatic chains song et al 2021 the van krevelen diagrams fig 1e h were expressed in the form of color mapped bubble plots which could represent the relative abundance of different molecular formulas directly as shown in fig 1e f the chemodiversity of dbc molecular formulas showed quite different nature when compared to freshwater or estuarine dom in van krevelen space van krevelen 1950 in addition there were relatively obvious differences when compared to the dbc samples raised by other literature reports qu et al 2016 song et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 these differences were mostly due to the various feedstock sources and production conditions overall the main compound classes in dbc3 and dbc5 were rather distinct major assigned formulas of dbc3 had relatively high h c ratios 1 1 5 and dbc3 was mainly constituted by highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds comparatively low h c species increased significantly in dbc5 and abundant combustion derived polycyclic aromatics and vascular plant derived polyphenols were distributed here as the pyrolysis continued the characteristic of black carbon that was rich in carbon and poor in hydrogen condensed aromatic structures became more noticeable kim et al 2004 molecular formulas containing n ie chon subgroups also showed a similar phenomenon signifying that more nitrogen containing aromatic rings might present in dbc5 e g pyrroles with aliphatic side chains compared to dbc3 gonsior et al 2019 xc c diagrams the representation of the aromaticity equivalent were utilized to differentiate compounds with varying degrees of unsaturation yassine et al 2014 as illustrated in fig 2 it was evident that dbc5 compare to dbc3 contained more unsaturated bonds and greater aromaticity this was proven by the rapid increase in xc when at c11 23 for instance the xc of most formulas in dbc5 were increased to 2 8 at carbon number 15 while the corresponding values of dbc3 were distributed in 2 7 these variations imputed to the monomers polymerization and aromatization over the pyrolysis the composition of the cho species the largest percentage of the subgroup across whole the formulas was investigated by kmd analysis in short the homologous series with identical repeat functional groups such as ch2 and coo could be analyzed by kmd plots bahureksa et al 2021 sleighter and hatcher 2007 as shown in fig 3 homologous series that only varied in the number of series displayed the same kmd value and lay on the same horizontal line apparently compared to the kmd ch2 plot of dbc5 dbc3 owned more long chain compounds tao et al 2014 which was likely due to the cracking of the long chain molecules during the pyrolysis process because dbc has relatively high content of carboxylic groups qu et al 2016 kmd coo analysis for cho species was also performed in this study compared to the dbc5 the kmd coo layout of dbc3 was distributed in a wider range especially the low region kmd 0 3 generally the number of c and h and the value of h c increased with the absolute value of kmd coo increased in the vertical direction implying that dbc3 contained more saturated molecules with carboxyl groups kmd analysis provided potential and valuable information about the structures of dbc via subtle molecular differences besides more details about the dbc molecular compositions diversity that were tested by ft icr ms were elaborated in text s6 3 2 the adsorption fractionation of dbc on fh gt for ox and oxny subgroups figs s4 and s5 detected by ft icr ms when compare to dbc3 it could be clearly observed that there were more compounds with fewer o atoms in dbc3g and dbc3f especially in the latter proving that the compounds rich in oxygen were more preferably retained on the mineral surface during adsorption in xc c diagrams fig 2 more formulas exposed strong abundance at the lower xc values than original dbc3 samples which represented the preferential adsorption of higher xc components while the lower ones were maintained in the aqueous phase preferentially this indicated the vital role of high unsaturation compounds in the adsorption process likewise fh showed stronger selective adsorption property van krevelen diagrams and corresponding violin plots of dbc3g and dbc3f were demonstrated in fig 1 the characteristics of dbc supernatant after adsorption were rather similar to the initial sample nevertheless partial high molecular weight phenolics and highly unsaturated compounds disappeared after adsorption this was in accordance with the previous reports that the molecular with higher m z was more possible to adsorb on gt fh li et al 2022 additionally the formulas of aliphatic compounds with high molecular weight were also lost preferentially remained aliphatic fractions on iron oxyhydroxides were also detected in former studies genest et al 2014 lv et al 2016 from the kmd ch2 layouts of cho species fig 3 high molecular weight components with long c chains were evidently favorably kept on gt fh besides the molecular formulas in the upper right corner of the kmd coo diagram disappeared after being adsorbed on fh gt suggesting the preferential adsorption of rich carboxyl group components in unsaturated molecules in the lower right corner the formulas represented saturated molecules with carboxyl groups o 10 18 were lost both on fh gt adsorption and dbc3g displayed similar but inconspicuous phenomena additionally owning to the adsorption preferences results of the dbc5 were similar to that of dbc3 the analyses of dbc5 dbc5g and dbc5f were briefly shown in text s7 furthermore pca analysis was performed for a series of intensive time sampling sequence of each group based on various optical parameters feng et al 2021 to evaluate the difference between the adsorption processes as shown in fig s7 two principal components pcs were extracted explaining 79 44 of the total variance of the dataset dbc3 and dbc5 owned varying degrees of separation between dbc before and after adsorption proofing that dbc from low pyrolyzed temperature might had a stronger affinity to gt and fh besides dbc adsorbed by gt plotted more gathered features while the samples separated distinctly in the plot after being adsorbed by fh these indicated that the weakly crystalline fh had better adsorption properties to dbc 3 3 investigation of the temporal molecular fractionation 3 3 1 2d sfs cos analyses to examine the adsorption characteristics of fluorescent components induced by iron oxyhydroxides synchronous fluorescence spectra of dbc supernatant with various adsorption time points were measured and the 2d sfs cos were produced based on the former research fluorescent signals might be divided into three parts regions that are protein like 250 310 nm fulvic like 310 380 nm and humic like regions 380 600 nm respectively guo et al 2022 hur and lee 2011 as shown in fig s8a b four auto peaks were identified by the synchronous map of dbc3g including peaks at 378 nm and 346 nm and two weak peaks at 366 nm and 396 nm suggesting the fulvic like compounds were extremely susceptible during the adsorption followed by humic like regions for the synchronous map of dbc3f auto peak at 358 nm was the only peak observed which meant the fulvic like matters had absolute priority during the adsorption of dbc3 on fh dbc5g and dbc5f exhibited similar forms of synchronous map distribution fig s8c d auto peaks at 328 and 342 nm intimated the preferential adsorption of fulvic like components for each synchronous map all the cross peaks were positive evincing that the fluorophores variations followed the same direction li et al 2020 the asynchronous maps supplied extra details regarding the order of the spectral origins during adsorption fig s8e h displayed the asynchronous maps and table s1 listed the detailed assignments of the peaks and signs of the cross peaks taking dbc3f as an example results showed these various cross peaks were positive and negative within the same region hinting that the sequential changes not only related to the type of fluorescent substance but also more to the types number and exposure of functional groups in the fluorescent components li et al 2020 xu et al 2018 in addition it seemed that the dbc3 exhibited more reactive functional groups compared to dbc5 guo et al also reported that biochar derived dom at a 300 c pyrolysis temperature displayed more ligands than those at 500 c and 700 c when interacting with cu ii guo et al 2022 compared with generalized 2d cos mw2d cos not only provided information along the spectral variable direction but information along the perturbation variable direction was visually captured the results of mw2d sfs cos synchronous maps fig s8i l demonstrated the peaks mostly gathered in the region of fulvic like compounds the fluorescent fractions were mainly adsorbed over the first 1 h and few fluorescent substances might be adsorbed during 1 2 h 3 3 2 analyses of ftir with 2d cos and mw2d cos 2d ftir cos and mw2d ftir cos were employed to analyze the region of 1800 600 cm 1 chen et al 2015 liu et al 2017 where the most valuable information about dbc structures appeared the ftir spectra of the original mineral and the gt fh dbc complexes sampled at various adsorption time points were determined for fh dbc3 and fh dbc5 the synchronous maps fig 4 a b exhibited four predominant auto peaks at 1620 1380 and 690 1000 cm 1 the peaks at 1620 1380 and 600 1000 cm 1 were demonstrated to change significantly which were attributed to cc stretching of aromatic rings co stretching and oh deformation of phenolic groups and one to four adjacent h deformations of aromatic nucleus ch respectively chen et al 2015 dun et al 2013 li et al 2021a suggesting the abundant phenolics and condensed aromatic compounds in dbc were adsorbed it was in line with the observation of ft icr ms in comparison the synchronous maps for gt dbc3 and gt dbc5 exposed entirely different results fig 4c d the peaks at 690 1000 cm 1 could both be observed implying the aromatic compounds were a distinctive component and had absolute superiority during the adsorption process additionally most of the peaks at the cross peaks were almost positive and just a few negative in synchronous maps which might connote the dynamic adsorption process of certain functional groups on iron oxyhydroxides tables 1 and s2 showed the detailed information of the cross peaks in the asynchronous maps fig 4e h in dbc iron oxyhydroxide systems to elaborate the sequential structures fractionation directly according to noda s role the sequential order of structural affinities of the adsorption of dbc on fh could be concluded as follow for fh dbc3 the order was 1380 690 1000 1620 690 1000 1150 690 1000 cm 1 which was corresponded to the order that phenolics aromatics aliphatics aromatics for fh dbc5 the order was 690 1000 1620 1380 1150 690 1000 cm 1 representing the order that aromatics phenolics aromatics aliphatics moreover the order of gt dbc3 was 690 1000 1620 1380 cm 1 which showed the order that aromatic compounds phenolics in gt dbc5 system the order was 1620 690 1000 1380 cm 1 demonstrating the order that aromatics phenolics aliphatic it should be noted that the region of 690 1000 cm 1 contained different peaks that represented the aromatic nucleus ch with different adjacent h deformations and thus 1 more than once occurrence of 690 1000 cm 1 in the same sequence and 2 the meant both positive and negative peaks were present in the region which was corresponded to the in table 1 overall these findings manifested the same feature that the aromatic or and phenolic groups were preferentially adsorbed and then the aliphatic groups besides a small amount of sustained adsorption of aromatic compounds might be present here synchronous maps of mw2d ftir cos provided a clear insight into the temporal adsorption of functional groups by taking the adsorption time as an external disturbance as illustrated in fig 4i l three peaks at around 690 1000 1380 and 1620 cm 1 were discovered in both fh dbc3 and fh dbc5 suggesting the aromatic and phenolic compounds had the absolute adsorption advantage and mostly adsorbed over the first 60 min however for gt there was only one obvious peak at 690 1000 cm 1 that was ascribed to aromatic groups importantly the information of y coordinates of all synchronous maps implied aromatic group was likely adsorbed on iron oxyhydroxides continuously after the 60 min rapid process li et al 2021a zhou et al 2019 2d sfs ftir heterocos analysis were conducted fig s9 to verify the correlation between the sfs and ftir spectra text s8 3 3 3 determination of conac and phenols based on the sequential information got from 2d cos analyses bpca method folin ciocalteu method and a 254 parameters were further used to quantify the amount of the conac phenolics and aromatics respectively the conac concentrations in dbc solutions were estimated following dittmar 2008 dittmar 2008 as shown in fig 5 a a significant drop in the first 5 min and the majority of losses occurred within the first 120 min the absorbed conac on minerals over 300 min ranged from about 30 to 82 indication of bpcas distribution further clarified that selective adsorption was also connected with the degree of aromatic condensation of conac fig s10 whether dbc3 or dbc5 the polycondensation degree decreased during the adsorption on gt or fh and it was demonstrated that compounds with higher condensation would be preferentially adsorbed in order to confirm the adsorption properties of the aromatic moiety the parameters of a 254 were applied to fit adsorption kinetic curves fig s2b similar to the conac based adsorption behaviors the fast adsorption showed in the first 1 h and reached dynamic equilibrium at the initial 2 5 h phenolic substances were determined by folin ciocalteu method fig 5b the results signified that the adsorption curves of phenols occurred mostly in the initial 60 min whatever the type of dbc or iron oxyhydroxides remarkably such adsorption was detectable after only 5 min of exposure which was in accord with the conac and aromatics in general these determinations agreed with the 2d cos analyses and further supplied credible data support furthermore it was worth mentioning that we found that the value of conac for dbc5 2 911 mgc l 1 was about 5 5 times higher than that of dbc3 0 527 mgc l 1 and accounts for approximately 30 of the doc concentration representing the significance of pyrolysis temperature during the preparation and the uniqueness of conac structures in dbc sample 4 discussion studies had previously indicated the mechanisms of the adsorption of dom on iron oxyhydroxide surface including electrostatic interaction ligand exchange hydrophobic interaction hydrogen bonding van der waals forces and cation bridging it had been researched that ligand exchange was the dominant mechanism for the adsorption of dom onto fe oxyhydroxides bao et al 2021 kleber et al 2021 ligand exchange refers to the functional groups such as cooh and oh from dom form the inner sphere complexation with the surface hydroxylated groups of iron oxyhydroxides lv et al 2016 according to a 254 conac phenolics results rapid initial adsorption occurred to conac aromatics and phenolics at the first 60 min of dbc exposure at each exposure time point the percentages of the removal ratios were nearly larger than the nonselective sorption percentage predicted based on the doc concentration confirming the preferential adsorption of these compounds fig s11 both phenolics and the high condensation fraction in aromatics conac showed relatively stronger adsorption capacity on iron oxyhydroxides surface greater affinities of aromatic and phenolic compounds on the mineral surface were also detected by ft icr ms in previous studies these compounds were likely to be involved in ligand exchange and formed the inner sphere complexation notably a former study that depended on ft icr ms did not observe the fast adsorption of conac compounds at the initial 5 min by ft icr ms coward et al 2018 combined with our results this might be attributed to the dynamic adsorption desorption process or either outcompeted initially by less substituted aromatic compounds not the steric hindrances high selective during the adsorption of the condensation conac could also prove it with the cumulative concentration of doc adsorbed on mineral increased consistently surface hydroxyl sites in gt fh were gradually occupied when these direct mineral organic matter om interactions were weakened several studies considered that the om om interactions were present potentially kleber et al 2021 mitchell and simpson 2013 zang et al 2000 chen et al also raised legacy effects which considered that the retention of highly sorptive organic molecules on minerals decreased the reactive site availability of mineral surface where the om om interactions theoretically played a vital role chen et al 2022b briefly as minerals reactive surface functional groups gradually reached saturation later loadings of dom might include a co action of mineral om and om om interactions rather than single mineral om interaction as initial consequently a mineral particle might be coated with several om layers and finally form om mineral complexes remarkably it seemed that our kinetic architecture results fit this mechanism in detail according to our ft icr ms and 2d ftir cos results after the fast adsorption stage of aromatics and phenolics the aliphatic compounds and components with long c chains were proved to be adsorbed on the mineral surface these might be ascribed to the interactions between aliphatic compounds or fatty carbon chains in dbc supernatant and the adsorbed dbc structures similar results had been reported previously for example by batch chemical oxidation experiments clemente and simpson found that coating lignin clay complexes with dodecanoic acid one of the long chain aliphatic compounds could resist naclo2 oxidation and protect lignin from chemical oxidation in which the hydrophobic interactions between om om might be responsible for it clemente and simpson 2013 thevenot et al used a physicochemical soil lignin isolation procedure and proposed that the aliphatic aromatic interactions such as lignin lipids interactions could be a chemical pathway of lignin stabilization thevenot et al 2013 more visually genest et al analyzed the signals of the samples in dmso d6 a highly penetrating solvent that can penetrate into the hydrophobic domains and provide information on hydrophobic structures which recognized that aromatic moieties were protected within hydrophobic regions genest et al 2014 additionally π π eda interactions between the aromatic rings could drive the aromatic aromatic associations chen et al 2022a these mechanisms might explain the sluggish adsorption of aromatic molecules on iron oxyhydroxide after the fast adsorption which could observe by both mw2d ftir cos and bpca determination the difference between the adsorption efficiency of four groups dbc3g dbc3f dbc5g and dbc5f should be clarified on the one hand from the ft icr ms more aliphatic components hydrophilic phenolics and carboxyl groups were noticed in dbc3 while more low h c and aromatic groups were found in dbc5 dbc from lower pyrolysis temperature derived biochar had better adsorption behavior on iron oxyhydroxide surface which were co driven by various mechanisms possibly however c fe ratios ph ionic strength and other influence factors were not considered in our study so it might not be a universal rule intriguingly it needs to point out that the effect of mineral fractionation on dbc molecular heterogeneity was much less than the effect of pyrolysis temperature according to our ft icr ms analyses suggesting that the pyrolysis temperatures would still be the key factors to study the environmental behavior of dbc on the other hand based on the pca analysis and the ft icr ms results it was obvious that the fh with a poorly crystalline form facilitated the adsorption of organic substances more than goethite α feooh due to the higher surface area and more surface hydroxyl groups huang et al established that the principal adsorptive sites for dom were provided by the iron containing soil minerals by comparing the molecular fractionation of dom on soil with iron oxides removed nsio2 montmorillonite and fe rich montmorillonite huang et al 2019 in natural environment fh is thought of as a youthful fe oxyhydroxide and it exists in lakes streams and hydromorphic soils i e environments where oxidizing and reducing conditions alternate and hence an active iron turnover exists in comparison gt is one of the most pervasive fe oxyhydroxides in the environment because it is thermodynamically stable fe oxyhydroxide under aerobic surface conditions schwertmann and cornell 2008 different environmental conditions lead to the predominance of different types of iron oxyhydroxides which would alter the preservation of organic carbon therefore the study of the iron oxyhydroxide s preservation for dbc the labile and widespread organic carbon pool was rather significant in this study ft icr ms analyses revealed the molecular fractionation properties of dbc on gt fh 2d ftir cos analyses provided direct sequential fractionation evidence during the adsorption from our results although this approach could not provide information at the molecular level it was a rather valid convenient and easily attainable way compared to ft icr ms depending on above findings we further determined the conac phenolics and aromatics compounds via quantitative chemical methods and spectroscopic means which offered the temporal sequence intuitively our results showed the components with high adsorption affinity on iron oxyhydroxide surface in dbc were similar to the other types of dom lv et al 2018 2016 zhang et al 2020 interestingly different from the three isolated stages zonal assembly models of soil derived dom on goethite examined by ft icr ms coward et al 2018 fast adsorption of both aromatics and phenolics in the initial 60 min were determined in our study which benefited from the quantitative research remarkably although aliphatic compounds cannot be quantified we considered that the preferential adsorption of aliphatic fractions was the evidence that supported the om layering mechanism very likely and the hydrophobic zones might be formed here coward et al 2018 genest et al 2014 sollins et al 2006 information on the interaction between dbc and iron oxyhydroxide surface was of utmost necessity for predicting the behaviors and fates of nutrients and contaminants in aquatic environments for the molecular fractionation at the mineral water interface li et al confirmed the om components that had higher affinities to fh showed lower biodegradability by employing the aerobic biodegradation assay while the compounds having lower affinities to fh displayed higher biodegradability li et al 2021b it was proposed that the altered reactivity of ha during its fractionation on fh would influence the kinetic behavior of heavy metals in the solution ding et al 2019 wang et al also reported the interfacial molecular fractionation of dom on fh greatly reduces the photoproduction of reactive oxygen species ros of supernatant wang et al 2021 the condensation degree of the aromatic compounds in dbc was also closely related to the photolytic properties fang et al 2017 which decreased with the adsorption in our work in these processes the kinetic architecture of mineral bound om is critical in these process in fact because it could change the fractionated dom fractions that release into the aquatic environment directly also the compounds located beneath surface layer of om that are inaccessible by water may be protected from degradation by more polar compounds and become more stable clemente and simpson 2013 genest et al 2014 in summary the layering and architecture of dbc changed the chemical components of dbc and the surface chemistry of minerals and it affected the storage and stability of organic carbon from micrometer to ecosystem scales 5 conclusion in this work we implemented complementary analytical approaches including ft icr ms 2d sfs cos 2d ftir cos bpca analyses and the folin ciocalteu method to characterize the adsorption of dbc at iron oxyhydroxide water interface especially the sequential properties we came to the following conclusions 1 ft icr ms results illustrated that the high molecular weight compounds high unsaturation compounds oxygen rich molecules such as carboxy rich compounds and phenolics aliphatics and fractions with long c chains were more preferably retained on the minerals 2 the fulvic like fractions contained carboxylic phenolic and aromatic groups were noticed to maintain on the iron oxyhydroxide surface preferentially and the sequential fractionation of dbc on iron oxyhydroxide aromatic and phenolic groups aliphatic groups 3 the aromatic compounds with higher condensation would be preferentially adsorbed and few aromatic fractions were found to be continuously adsorbed after the initial fast adsorption 4 dbc from various pyrolysis temperature derived biochar had different adsorption behavior on the iron oxyhydroxide which were relevant to the chemical components besides various forms of iron oxyhydroxides in different environmental settings would alter the preservation of organic carbon overall our findings were consistent with the hypothesis that the loadings of dom on iron oxyhydroxide might include the co driven of mineral om and om om interactions rather than single mineral om interaction these results supported the zonal assembly and hydrophobic zones theories this work was expected to enhance the understanding of the adsorptive fractionation and its temporal sequence of dbc on iron oxyhydroxide which was of special value for elucidating stabilization and mobility mechanisms for organic carbon in the soil water environment as well as for the environmental behavior and effect of contaminants declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

15207,microcystins mcs are harmful to the ecology and public health some bacteria can degrade mcs into adda but few can destroy adda adda is the key bioactive moiety of mcs and mainly contributes to hepatotoxicity we had previously isolated an indigenous novel bacterial strain named sphingopyxis sp yf1 that can efficiently degrade mcs and its key bioactive moiety adda but the mechanisms remained unknown here the biodegradation mechanisms and pathways of adda were systematically investigated using multi omics analysis mass spectrometry and heterologous expression the transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles of strain yf1 during adda degradation were revealed for the first time multi omics analyses suggested that the fatty acid degradation pathway was enriched specifically the expression of genes encoding aminotransferase beta oxidation β oxidation enzymes and phenylacetic acid paa degradation enzymes were significantly up regulated during adda degradation these enzymes were further proven to play important roles in the biodegradation of adda simultaneously some novel potential degradation products of adda were identified successfully including 7 methoxy 4 6 dimethyl 8 phenyloca 2 4 dienoic acid c17h22o3 2 methyl 3 methoxy 4 phenylbutyric acid c12h16o3 and phenylacetic acid paa c8h8o2 in summary the adda was converted into paa through aminotransferase and β oxidation enzymes then the paa was further degraded by paa degradation enzymes and finally to co2 via the tricarboxylic acid cycle this study comprehensively elucidated the novel mc lr biodegradation mechanisms especially the new enzymatic pathway of adda degradation these findings provide a new perspective on the applications of microbes in the mcs polluted environment graphical abstract image

detected globally and the concentration of mcs in natural water was vary from 9 9 μg l to 23 718 103µg l corbel et al 2014 liu et al 2022 you et al 2022 humans can be exposed to mcs by several pathways including recreational water activities contaminated drinking water or contaminated food especially fish crustaceans bivalves or vegetables gutiérrez praena et al 2013 mcs exposure would contribute to the damage of liver intestine brain kidney heart and gonads alosman et al 2020 he et al 2022 ma et al 2021 shahmohamadloo et al 2021 feng et al 2022 zheng et al 2021 chemically mcs are cyclic heptapeptide molecules that possess over 300 structural variants in nature baliu rodriguez et al 2022 microcystin leucine arginine mc lr is the most widely disseminated and intensely harmful to humans and the ecological system yang et al 2022 the world health organization who established the lifetime and short term drinking water guideline values of 1 and 12 μg l for mc lr who 2020 in addition a lifetime tolerable daily intake tdi of 40 ng day kg of body weight for mc lr has been proposed lance et al 2021 who 2020 thus it is still urgent effectively remove mcs pollution mc lr is quite stable in natural environments due to the cyclical chemical structure tsuji et al 1994 recently it was reported that the environmental concentration of mc lr was ranged from 0 23 µg l to 36 5 103µg l breidenbach et al 2022 gao et al 2022 several chemical and physical strategies have been used to eliminate mc lr from waters but the low efficiency high operating costs and harmful byproducts restricted their extension cao et al 2022 kurtz et al 2021 biological approaches draw attention since they are eco friendly in the removal of mcs many bacteria have been isolated and recognized as mc degraders including sphingomonas sp acm 3962 bourne et al 1996 y2 and 7cy ishii et al 2004 bordetella sp mc lth1 yang et al 2014 sphingopyxis sp ustb 05 yan et al 2012 and yf1 yang et al 2020 among others most of them were aerobic and contained mlr gene clusters hereinafter called mlr it was acknowledged that mlr bacteria could synthesize mlrabcd enzymes that were responsible for mc degradation bourne et al 1996 2001 more specifically the cyclic mc structure was hydrolyzed into linearized mc by mlra enzyme a glutamate protease encoded by mlra which was regarded as the first and most important process in the biodegradation of mcs cai et al 2022 xu et al 2019 the linearized mc was converted into a tetrapeptide via mlrb enzyme a serine protease encoded by mlrb wei et al 2021 the tetrapeptide was hydrolyzed into adda by mlrc enzyme a metalloprotease encoded by mlrc dziga et al 2016 mlrd enzyme encoded by mlrd was thought to be involved in the transport of mcs and its degradation products since it was a putative oligopeptide transporter bourne et al 1996 2001 dziga et al 2016 these enzymes are important in degrading mc lr into adda 2s 3s 8s 9s 3 amino 9 methoxy 2 6 8 trimethyl 10 phenyl deca 4 6 dienoic acid however how the product adda is further utilized by mlr bacteria are still unknown adda was derived from various mc variants and the concentration of adda was positive correlated to that of mcs yang et al 2014 additionally the molecular weight of mc variants e g mc lr 995 2 was almost three times of adda 331 2 so the environmental concentration of adda was probably higher than that of mcs yang et al 2020 moreover adda is a common characteristic bioactive moiety of mcs foss and aubel 2015 tsuji et al 2006 adda was thought to be the final product of mcs biodegradation previously bourne et al 1996 manage et al 2009 but still exhibit biological activity for a certain toxicity bourne et al 2006 chen et al 2012 notably adda was mainly formed a covalent bond with protein phosphatases and contributed to hepatotoxicity carmichael and an 1999 therefore it is important to remove mc lr and adda efficiently to our knowledge the published studies mainly focused on the step of mc lr biodegradation into adda but there are still lots of research gaps on further degradation of adda especially the degradation pathways of the toxic adda are still unknown thus more efforts should be made to comprehensive elucidation of the mc lr and its moiety adda degradation mechanisms and pathways in the previous study our team isolated a novel indigenous bacterium named sphingopyxis sp yf1 with an efficient capacity for mc lr and adda degradation yang et al 2020 however the molecular mechanisms underlying the biodegradation of adda remain unknown in this study the crucial enzymes and pathways involved in mc lr and its bioactive moiety adda degradation were first investigated by integrating multi omics analysis mass spectrometry heterologous expression molecular docking and comparative genomic analysis the transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles of mc degrading bacteria involved in adda degradation were revealed the major products of adda were identified by mass spectrometry technology the roles of the important enzymes were verified by heterologous expression this work comprehensively elucidated the biodegradation mechanisms and pathways of mc lr and its bioactive moiety adda and provided new insights for the application of microbial degradation technology in the mcs polluted water environment 2 material and methods 2 1

of interest were visualized using easyfig 2 2 5 sullivan et al 2011 3 results 3 1 biodegradation of mc lr and its bioactive moiety adda fig 1 shows the high efficiency in biodegradation of mc lr by stain yf1 the concentration of mc lr and its intermediate products were lower than the limit of detection of uplc at 180 min when mc lr was co incubated with strain yf1 the concentration of mc lr decreased gradually from 0 min to 180 min the concentration of linearized mc lr and tetrapeptide was increased and reached a maximum at 60 min and 90 min respectively fig 1a b d according to concentration of mc lr and its intermediate products the adda appeared at 60 min and gradually increased then declined after co incubation for 120 min further disappearing at 180 min fig 1b d in addition a smaller intermediate product identified as paa was observed after 180 min fig 1c moreover mass balance analysis showed that the contribution of biosorption in adda removal could be negligible 2 fig 1e which indicated that the biodegradation was the main route to remove adda in strain yf1 treatment 3 2 transcriptomic analysis of sphingopyxis sp yf1 during mc lr and adda degradation to explore the genes responsible for mc lr and adda degradation transcriptomics profiles of sphingopyxis sp yf1 during mc lr and adda degradation were analyzed respectively compared to the control groups there were 116 genes significantly up regulated while 98 genes down regulated during mc lr degradation fig s1 in addition when compared to the corresponding control groups 311 genes were significantly up regulated while 340 genes were down regulated during adda degradation fig 2 a the degs were submitted to kegg pathway enrichment analysis in order to better understand the molecular pathway of mc lr and adda degradation by strain yf1 kegg pathways analysis showed that the degs were most involved in fatty acid degradation fatty acid metabolism one carbon pool by folate renin angiotensin system and antifolate resistance pathways during adda degradation fig 2b however during mc lr degradation the degs were enrich in pyrimidine metabolism amino trna biosynthesis and phenylalanine metabolism fig s1 thus the genes involved in the fatty acid degradation pathway probably participated in adda degradation specifically according to the transcriptomic analysis the expression of the mlr gene cluster fatty acid degradation gene cluster and paa degrading gene cluster were significantly up regulated during mc lr and adda degradation figs 2c d s2 moreover the genes encoding fatty acid degradation enzymes fatty acid coa ligase 3 hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenase thiolase fig 2c during adda degradation were higher than those in mc lr degradation these enzymes are the well known β oxidation enzymes that involved in fatty acid degradation pathway kegg reference pathway map00071 the expression of genes encoding β oxidation enzymes were up regulated more than 2 4 fold during adda degradation in particular the expression of gene encoding thiolase during adda degradation was about 16 fold higher than that of the control groups similarity the expression of genes encoding paa degradation enzymes e g paaase paaz paag paaa paaj paae were up regulated more than 2 1 fold during adda degradation fig 2d in addition the expression of a gene encoding aminotransferase around these gene clusters was 3 5 fold higher than that of the control groups fig 2c in addition compared to the adda degradation by strain yf1 the expression of mlr genes was higher during mc lr degradation fig s2 3 3 metabolic response of sphingopyxis sp yf1 during mc lr and adda degradation when 80 of the mc lr was degraded and adda was degraded the metabolomics of strain yf1 was analyzed metabolites of strain yf1 incubated in the treatment and the control groups were determined the results showed that the qc had a high polymerization degree repeatability and a stable detection system based on the data for identified and quantified metabolites a total of 3216 metabolites were found including 2100 in positive mode and 1116 in negative mode a supervised opls da model was applied to overview the metabolite profiles in the two groups the opls da score plot showed that the treatment groups were clearly separated from the control groups fig 3 a moreover a total of 207 significantly altered metabolites were identified including 105 up regulated and 102 down regulated metabolites fig 3b in addition pathway analysis showed that several metabolites were enriched in pantothenate and coa biosynthesis and fatty acid degradation pathways fig 3c according to the transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis the β oxidation pathway accomplished the degradation of aliphatic carbon chain were integrated in strain yf1 fig 3d the microbial β oxidation pathway was activated by fatty acid coa ligase which linked the aliphatic carbon chain r1 with coa then the r1 coa was cyclically catalyzed via dehydrogenation acyl coa dehydrogenase hydration enoyl coa hydratase redehydrogenation 3 hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenase and sulfuration thiolase reactions two carbons were removed and the acetyl propionyl coa were generated in each round of β oxidation pathway until all carbon atoms in the aliphatic carbon chain were removed fig 3d 3 4 the expression of genes involved in mc lr and adda biodegradation to further verify genes encoding these enzymes responsible for mc lr and adda degradation the mrna level of sphingopyxis sp yf1 was evaluated by qrt pcr during the mc lr degrading process temporal variations in the mrna levels of genes encoding mcs degradation enzymes aminotransferase β oxidation enzymes and paa degradation enzymes in strain yf1 were displayed in fig 4 when strain yf1 was incubated with mc lr for 90 min the expression of genes encoding mcs degradation enzymes e g mlra mlrb mlrc enzymes aminotransferase β oxidation enzymes e g fatty acid coa ligase acyl coa dehydrogenase enoyl coa hydratase 3 hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenase and thiolase were significantly increased compare to those of the control groups fig 4a c in addition the expression of genes encoding paa degradation enzymes e g paaase paaa paag and paaz enzymes were significantly increased at 120 min compared to those of the control groups fig 4b notably the expression of mlr genes was highest at 90 min when the expression of mlr genes were more than 2 2 fold higher than those of the control groups the expression of genes encoding aminotransferase was 5 0 fold higher than that of the control groups at 150 min similarity the expression of genes encoding β oxidation enzymes were up regulated more than 2 4 fold in treatment groups at 150 min moreover the expression of genes encoding paa degradation enzymes were increased with time and reached a maximum at 150 min fig 4b in which the expression of these genes were up regulated more than 7 2 fold during adda degradation 3 5 identification of adda pathway and functional verification of adda degradation enzymes degradation of adda by aminotransferase and β oxidation enzymes were performed at 30 and ph 7 in the dark uplc analysis showed that the peak area of adda fell gradually and the main intermediate products of adda peak a appeared after incubated for 2 h fig 5 a and b peak b occurred along with a decline of peak a fig 5b and c moreover peak c appeared when adda were incubated with aminotransferase and β oxidation enzymes for 24 h in contrast there was no adda degradation in the control groups furthermore the adda and its intermediate products were identified using uplc esi ms analysis the adda with major ions at m z 332 43958 fig 5a e were identified successfully besides the major ions of degradation products peak a b and c might be 7 methoxy 4 6 dimethyl 8 phenyloca 2 4 dienoic acid m z 274 80811 c17h22o3 fig 5b f 2 methyl 3 methoxy 4 phenylbutyric acid m z 209 28021 c12h16o3 mmpb fig 5c g and phenylacetic acid m z 136 24501 c8h8o2 paa respectively fig 5d h 3 6 molecular mechanism of adda and its intermediates biodegradation homology modeling and molecular docking analysis suggested that aminotransferase fatty acid coa ligase and paaase contained conserved amino acid residues formed the pockets which provided possibility of active sites for these enzymes figs 6 a s3a s4a adda c20h26o4 and paa were successfully docked into the binding pockets of aminotransferase fig 6b fatty acid coa ligase fig s3b and paaase fig s4b respectively the adda connected with aminotransferase by forming conventional hydrogen bonds pi alpyl stacked and van der waals force fig 6b c among them the amino acid residues tyr132 ser100 ala39 leu243 and ala211 located in aminotransferase have strong affinity with adda fig 6c after that adda was transferred to an aromatic aliphatic hydrocarbon c20h26o4 and it was degraded further by a suit of β oxidation enzymes more specifically the c20h26o4 could form hydrogen bonds carbon hydrogen bonds and van der waals interaction with fatty acid coa ligase fig s3c similarity the paaase could activate the paa by the interactions of van der waals interaction hydrogen bonds and pi pi stacked fig s4c the paa was then converted to paa coa and the paa coa was further degraded into acetyl coa by the other paa degradation enzymes together these results indicated that the aminotransferase and β oxidation enzymes adda might have the potential to degrade adda and its intermediates which were in accordance with the transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses 3 7 identification of interested genes in three mc degrading bacteria two additional complete genome sequences of mc degrading bacterial strains were obtained the genomic features and strains information of currently sequenced mc degrading bacteria were presented in table 1 the linear comparison of mlr and its neighbor gene clusters arrangements in the genome sequences of the three mc degrading strains was generated and visualized fig 6 except for the mlr and paa gene clusters several genes related to β oxidation pathway were discovered genes encoding β oxidation enzymes such as fatty acyl coa synthase acyl coa dehydrogenase enoyl coa hydratase 3 hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenase and thiolase were highlighted in particular the genes encoding aminotransferase were discovered in these mc degrading bacteria these encoding genes might be involved in the degradation of mc lr and adda but need further verify the presence of these genes probably helps the mc degrading bacteria survive and adapt to mcs environment in a word these bacteria might be important in the mcs biodegradation and carbon nitrogen cycle for ecological balance 4 discussion mcs pollution remains a substantial public health concern and biodegradation is regarded as an effective method to reduce its prevalence however the mc lr biodegradation pathway has not been fully elucidated especially the degradation mechanisms of adda were unknown the transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles of strain yf1 were explored during adda degradation for the first time aminotransferase and β oxidation enzymes as well as some novel products involved in adda degradation were identified and validated using heterologous expression and mass spectrometry this study revealed a novel enzymatic pathway of adda degradation by sphingopyxis sp yf1 so far the degradation pathway of mc lr and its bioactive moiety adda was illustrated completely we found that the mc lr and its bioactive adda were degraded effectively by strain yf1 mass balance analysis suggested that the biodegradation was the main route for adda removal it was the first time to investigate the contribution of biosorption in adda removal furthermore we used a transcriptomic approach to identify genes encoding crucial enzymes that might be involved in adda degradation the analysis suggested that the degs of adda degradation were mainly enriched in the fatty acid degradation pathway moreover the fatty acid degradation genes nearby mlr and paa genes were focused in which many genes were significantly up regulated during adda degradation including genes encoding fatty acyl coa synthase acyl coa dehydrogenase enoyl coa hydratase 3 hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenase and thiolase actually all of these enzymes were the well known β oxidation enzymes fujita et al 2007 additionally we found the expression of a gene encoding aminotransferase was significantly up regulated aminotransferase might play a unique role in transferring an amino group fazel and jensen 1979 liu et al 2020 palacio et al 2019 then the adda might be converted to an aromatic aliphatic hydrocarbon c20h26o4 the c20h26o4 contained a branch fatty acid and it was further degraded into paa by β oxidation enzymes the β oxidation enzymes were the main enzymes that responsible for fatty acid degradation pathway kegg reference pathway map00071 thus most of the changed genes were involved in fatty acid degradation pathway moreover many aromatic aliphatic hydrocarbons were reported to be biodegraded via the fatty acid degradation pathway gravouil et al 2017 le et al 2010 you et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 in addition the expression of genes encoding paa degradation enzymes were significantly up regulated during adda degradation paa degradation pathway was through to be the final step in the degradation of mc lr yang et al 2020 zeng et al 2021 specifically the paa was degraded into acetyl coenzyme a acetyl coa by the paa degradation enzymes which had been extensively researched in details crofts et al 2018 teufel et al 2010 the transcriptomic profiles of yf1 during adda degradation was explored for the first time and the qrt pcr results were consistent with the transcriptomic analysis therefore the aminotransferase β oxidation enzymes and paa degradation enzymes might play important roles in adda degradation furthermore the metabolomic profiles of strain yf1 during mc lr and its key bioactive moiety adda degradation were firstly investigated compared to the control groups the pantothenate and coa biosynthesis and fatty acid degradation pathway were enriched the biosynthesis coa probably played an important role in fatty acid degradation since coa was the important substance in the first step of β oxidation pathway kallscheuer et al 2017 usman et al 2022 during the β oxidation process the substrates were broken down in a repeating process by the β oxidation enzymes as aforementioned and the bond between the α carbon and β carbon atoms of the substrate were broken fig 3d each round of this process removed two carbon fragments producing acetyl coa and the intermediate with two carbon atoms fewer than the original finally the substrates were degraded to the phenylacetic acid paa and acetyl coa lynen 1953 shen and burger 2009 wakil et al 1954 metabolomics research referred to the downstream products of gene expression which directly reflected the metabolism state and degradation potential of the bacteria wright et al 2021 moreover the results were consisted with the genes expression analysis which suggested the β oxidation enzymes were important in adda biodegradation fig 7 moreover we verified that the adda were degraded efficiently by aminotransferase and β oxidation enzymes from strain yf1 using heterologous expression the genes encoding aminotransferase and β oxidation enzymes were expressed successfully and they were incubated with adda as the sole carbon nitrogen substrates the mixtures were withdrawn at different times and the degradation products were observed and identified as 7 methoxy 4 6 dimethyl 8 phenyloca 2 4 dienoic acid c17h22o3 2 methyl 3 methoxy 4 phenylbutyric acid c12h16o3 also known as mmpb and phenylacetic acid c8h8o2 also known as paa however the controls without these enzymes were unable to degrade adda which confirmed that the aminotransferase and β oxidation enzymes were important in adda biodegradation the uplc esi ms was very useful in identifying the intermediate products li et al 2022 pan et al 2021 the c17h22o3 were first found by uplc esi ms and it might be a novel product during mc lr and adda degradation in addition the c12h16o3 mmpb was identified to be an oxidative product of mcs and has been used as a marker for measuring the total concentration of mcs anaraki et al 2020 these results demonstrated that adda was subsequently degraded to paa via aminotransferase and β oxidation enzymes the adda degradation pathway was proposed firstly adda was converted into c20h26o4 by aminotransferase the molecular docking analysis confirmed the strong interactions between adda and aminotransferase although c20h26o4 was not detected using uplc esi ms due to the possible excessive reaction rate and present mass spectrum conditions molecular docking has emerged as a powerful tool to explore the interactions of the corresponding substrates and enzymes and has been widely applied to investigate the degradation potential and mechanism of enzymes toward substrates cai et al 2022 chu et al 2022 li et al 2022 secondly the c20h26o4 was degraded into c17h22o3 c15h20o3 c12h16o3 mmpb and c8h8o2 paa in turns via four rounds of β oxidation the interactions between c20h26o4 and the fatty acid coa ligase the first enzymes of β oxidation pathway were confirmed by molecular docking finally paa was degraded via the ppa degradation pathway which have illustrated previously crofts et al 2018 teufel et al 2010 yang et al 2020 moreover our results suggested that the paa interacted with paaase by a series of intermolecular forces these results were in accordance with the multi omics analysis and these findings confirmed that the aminotransferase β oxidation enzymes and paa degradation enzymes played major degradation roles in the process of adda removal therefore the adda were not the final bio products of mc lr previous study also proposed that the co2 as a major end product of mc lr hyenstrand et al 2003 this study illustrated a novel enzymatic pathway of adda biodegradation in which the toxic mcs and adda were removed to lower than the limit of detection of uplc furthermore these determined products from adda biodegradation will be validated using the isotope labeling technique in future comparative genomics analysis could be used to characterize the gene function and metabolic potential of bacteria wang et al 2020 there were seven strains of mc degrading bacteria and their genomes were released but only three of them had their complete genomes sequenced up to now these mc degrading bacteria had multiple col linear genome fragments and each bacterium had many distinct genome sections proteins involved in these metabolic pathways were most likely essential for the basic biology and phenotype of bacteria as well as their adaptation to mc contaminated environments not only were the common mlr and paa gene clusters found in the three bacteria but the genes encoding aminotransferase and a suite of β oxidation enzymes were also found these important genes were investigated and highlighted in the genome of mc degrading bacteria for the first time it is plausible that the mlr pathway β oxidation process paa metabolism probably could provide energy sources and regulatory factors for bacterial growth survival and adaptation in the toxic environment due to the limited genome of mc degrading bacteria the mcs and paa metabolic potential of three genomes of mlr mc degrading bacteria were roughly explored previously zhang et al 2020 these mc degrading species might be relationship in the carbon cycle and ecological equilibrium the relationship between the strain yf1 and other mc degrading bacteria is still requiring to further exploration in summary a novel degradation pathway of mc lr was revealed especially the new enzymatic pathway of adda degradation was elucidated fig 8 sphingopyxis sp yf1 could successively degrade the environmental pollutants mc lr into adda by mlrabc enzymes then adda was into c20h26o4 c17h22o3 c12h16o3 mmpb and c8h8o2 paa by aminotransferase and β oxidation enzymes later the paa was degraded into acetyl coa by paaagzje enzymes the acetyl coa was further converted to final nontoxic co2 through the tca cycle which was a common metabolic pathway that happened in many organisms van rossum et al 2016 elucidation of the complete pathway was not only important in understanding the molecular mechanism of mc lr and adda degradation but also suggested the properties of the mc degrading bacteria in the ecological carbon cycle moreover the bacteria could be easily recycled and reused when it is immobilized in some supporting materials such as chitosan magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles carbon nanotubes graphite oxide etc wu et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 these materials might possess great catalytic ability stability and reusability which improved the efficiency of organic pollutants degradation kumar et al 2020 liu et al 2016 pan et al 2018 the bacterial strain yf1 combined with the immobilized materials may be a promising strategy to control mcs pollution in the field environment in the future using the principle of synthetic biology to transform these enzymes into a useful product might be meaningful in treatment mcs and adda pollution our findings provide new insights into the biological methods for the remediation of mcs pollution in water bodies 5 conclusion the complete mc lr degradation mechanisms especially the novel enzymatic pathways of adda degradation were elucidated via systematically integrated multi omics analysis mass spectrometry heterologous expression molecular docking and comparative genomic analysis mc lr was degraded into adda by mlrabc enzymes then adda was degraded into paa by the aminotransferase and β oxidation enzymes the paa was further degraded by paa degradation enzymes then acetyl coa was produced and it was transferred to the final co2 the enzymatic pathways of adda degradation were illustrated for the first time which enriched the biodegradation mechanisms and pathways of mc lr these findings will contribute to the application of microbes on mcs polluted water bodies in future credit authorship contribution statement jia wei

15207,microcystins mcs are harmful to the ecology and public health some bacteria can degrade mcs into adda but few can destroy adda adda is the key bioactive moiety of mcs and mainly contributes to hepatotoxicity we had previously isolated an indigenous novel bacterial strain named sphingopyxis sp yf1 that can efficiently degrade mcs and its key bioactive moiety adda but the mechanisms remained unknown here the biodegradation mechanisms and pathways of adda were systematically investigated using multi omics analysis mass spectrometry and heterologous expression the transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles of strain yf1 during adda degradation were revealed for the first time multi omics analyses suggested that the fatty acid degradation pathway was enriched specifically the expression of genes encoding aminotransferase beta oxidation β oxidation enzymes and phenylacetic acid paa degradation enzymes were significantly up regulated during adda degradation these enzymes were further proven to play important roles in the biodegradation of adda simultaneously some novel potential degradation products of adda were identified successfully including 7 methoxy 4 6 dimethyl 8 phenyloca 2 4 dienoic acid c17h22o3 2 methyl 3 methoxy 4 phenylbutyric acid c12h16o3 and phenylacetic acid paa c8h8o2 in summary the adda was converted into paa through aminotransferase and β oxidation enzymes then the paa was further degraded by paa degradation enzymes and finally to co2 via the tricarboxylic acid cycle this study comprehensively elucidated the novel mc lr biodegradation

bourne et al 1996 2001 more specifically the cyclic mc structure was hydrolyzed into linearized mc by mlra enzyme a glutamate protease encoded by mlra which was regarded as the first and most important process in the biodegradation of mcs cai et al 2022 xu et al 2019 the linearized mc was converted into a tetrapeptide via mlrb enzyme a serine protease encoded by mlrb wei et al 2021 the tetrapeptide was hydrolyzed into adda by mlrc enzyme a metalloprotease encoded by mlrc dziga et al 2016 mlrd enzyme encoded by mlrd was thought to be involved in the transport of mcs and its degradation products since it was a putative oligopeptide transporter bourne et al 1996 2001 dziga et al 2016 these enzymes are important in degrading mc lr into adda 2s 3s 8s 9s 3 amino 9 methoxy 2 6 8 trimethyl 10 phenyl deca 4 6 dienoic acid however how the product adda is further utilized by mlr bacteria are still unknown adda was derived from various mc variants and the concentration of adda was positive correlated to that of mcs yang et al 2014 additionally the molecular weight of mc variants e g mc lr 995 2 was almost three times of adda 331 2 so the environmental concentration of adda was probably higher than that of mcs yang et al 2020 moreover adda is a common characteristic bioactive moiety of mcs foss and aubel 2015 tsuji et al 2006 adda was thought to be the final product of mcs biodegradation previously bourne et al 1996 manage et al 2009 but still exhibit biological activity for a certain toxicity bourne et al 2006 chen et al 2012 notably adda was mainly formed a covalent bond with protein phosphatases and contributed to hepatotoxicity carmichael and an 1999 therefore it is important to remove mc lr and adda efficiently to our knowledge the published studies mainly focused on the step of mc lr biodegradation into adda but there are still lots of research gaps on further degradation of adda especially the degradation pathways of the toxic adda are still unknown thus more efforts should be made to comprehensive elucidation of the mc lr and its moiety adda degradation mechanisms and pathways in the previous study our team isolated a novel indigenous bacterium named sphingopyxis sp yf1 with an efficient capacity for mc lr and adda degradation yang et al 2020 however the molecular mechanisms underlying the biodegradation of adda remain unknown in

of interest were visualized using easyfig 2 2 5 sullivan et al 2011 3 results 3 1 biodegradation of mc lr and its bioactive moiety adda fig 1 shows the high efficiency in biodegradation of mc lr by stain yf1 the concentration of mc lr and its intermediate products were lower than the limit of detection of uplc at 180 min when mc lr was co incubated with strain yf1 the concentration of mc lr decreased gradually from 0 min to 180 min the concentration of linearized mc lr and tetrapeptide was increased and reached a maximum at 60 min and 90 min respectively fig 1a b d according to concentration of mc lr and its intermediate products the adda appeared at 60 min and gradually increased then declined after co incubation for 120 min further disappearing at 180 min fig 1b d in addition a smaller intermediate product identified as paa was observed after 180 min fig 1c moreover mass balance analysis showed that the contribution of biosorption in adda removal could be negligible 2 fig 1e which indicated that the biodegradation was the main route to remove adda in strain yf1 treatment 3 2 transcriptomic analysis of sphingopyxis sp yf1 during mc lr and adda degradation to explore the genes responsible for mc lr and adda degradation transcriptomics profiles of sphingopyxis sp yf1 during mc lr and adda degradation were analyzed respectively compared to the control groups there were 116 genes significantly up regulated while 98 genes down regulated during mc lr degradation fig s1 in addition when compared to the corresponding control groups 311 genes were significantly up regulated while 340 genes were down regulated during adda degradation fig 2 a the degs were submitted to kegg pathway enrichment analysis in order to better understand the molecular pathway of mc lr and adda degradation by strain yf1 kegg pathways analysis showed that the degs were most involved in fatty acid degradation fatty acid metabolism one carbon pool by folate renin angiotensin system and antifolate resistance pathways during adda degradation fig 2b however during mc lr degradation the degs were enrich in pyrimidine metabolism amino trna biosynthesis and phenylalanine metabolism fig s1 thus the genes involved in the fatty acid degradation pathway probably participated in adda degradation specifically according to the transcriptomic analysis the expression of the mlr gene cluster fatty acid degradation gene cluster and paa degrading gene cluster were significantly up regulated during mc lr and adda degradation figs 2c d s2 moreover the genes encoding fatty acid degradation enzymes fatty acid coa ligase 3 hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenase thiolase fig 2c during adda degradation were higher than those in mc lr degradation these enzymes are the well known β oxidation enzymes that involved in fatty acid degradation pathway kegg reference pathway map00071 the expression of genes encoding β oxidation enzymes were up regulated more than 2 4 fold during adda degradation in particular the expression of gene encoding thiolase during adda degradation was about 16 fold higher than that of the control groups similarity the expression of genes encoding paa degradation enzymes e g paaase paaz paag paaa paaj paae were up regulated more than 2 1 fold during adda degradation fig 2d in addition the expression of a gene encoding aminotransferase around these gene clusters was 3 5 fold higher than that of the control groups fig 2c in addition compared to the adda degradation by strain yf1 the expression of mlr genes was higher during mc lr degradation fig s2 3 3 metabolic response of sphingopyxis sp yf1 during mc lr and adda degradation when 80 of the mc lr was degraded and adda was degraded the metabolomics of strain yf1 was analyzed metabolites of strain yf1 incubated in the treatment and the control groups were determined the results showed that the qc had a high polymerization degree repeatability and a stable detection system based on the data for identified and quantified metabolites a total of 3216 metabolites were found including 2100 in positive mode and 1116 in negative mode a supervised opls da model was applied to overview the metabolite profiles in the two groups the opls da score plot showed that the treatment groups were clearly separated from the control groups fig 3 a moreover a total of 207 significantly altered metabolites were identified including 105 up regulated and 102 down regulated metabolites fig 3b in addition pathway analysis showed that several metabolites were enriched in pantothenate and coa biosynthesis and fatty acid degradation pathways fig 3c according to the transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis the β oxidation pathway accomplished the degradation of aliphatic carbon chain were integrated in strain yf1 fig 3d the microbial β oxidation pathway was activated by fatty acid coa ligase which linked the aliphatic carbon chain r1 with coa then the r1 coa was cyclically catalyzed via dehydrogenation acyl coa dehydrogenase hydration enoyl coa hydratase redehydrogenation 3 hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenase and sulfuration thiolase reactions two carbons were removed and the acetyl propionyl coa were generated in each round of β oxidation pathway until all carbon atoms in the aliphatic carbon chain were removed fig 3d 3 4 the expression of genes involved in mc lr and adda biodegradation to further verify genes encoding these enzymes responsible for mc lr and adda degradation the mrna level of sphingopyxis sp yf1 was evaluated by qrt pcr during the mc lr degrading process temporal variations in the mrna levels of genes encoding mcs degradation enzymes aminotransferase β oxidation enzymes and paa degradation enzymes in strain yf1 were displayed in fig 4 when strain yf1 was incubated with mc lr for 90 min the expression of genes encoding mcs degradation enzymes e g mlra mlrb mlrc enzymes aminotransferase β oxidation enzymes e g fatty acid coa ligase acyl coa dehydrogenase enoyl coa hydratase 3 hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenase and thiolase were significantly increased compare to those of the control groups fig 4a c in addition the expression of genes encoding paa degradation enzymes e g paaase paaa paag and paaz enzymes were significantly increased at 120 min compared to those of the control groups fig 4b notably the expression of mlr genes was highest at 90 min when the expression of mlr genes were more than 2 2 fold higher than those of the control groups the expression of genes encoding aminotransferase was 5 0 fold higher than that of the control groups at 150 min similarity the expression of genes encoding β oxidation enzymes were up regulated more than 2 4 fold in treatment groups at 150 min moreover the expression of genes encoding paa degradation enzymes were increased with time and reached a maximum at 150 min fig 4b in which the expression of these genes were up regulated more than 7 2 fold during adda degradation 3 5 identification of adda pathway and functional verification of adda degradation enzymes degradation of adda by aminotransferase and β oxidation enzymes were performed at 30 and ph 7 in the dark uplc analysis showed that the peak area of adda fell gradually and the main intermediate products of adda peak a appeared after incubated for 2 h fig 5 a and b peak b occurred along with a decline of peak a fig 5b and c moreover peak c appeared when adda were incubated with aminotransferase and β oxidation enzymes for 24 h in contrast there was no adda degradation in the control groups furthermore the adda and its intermediate products were identified using uplc esi ms analysis the adda with major ions at m z 332 43958 fig 5a e were identified successfully besides the major ions of degradation products peak a b and c might be 7 methoxy 4 6 dimethyl 8 phenyloca 2 4 dienoic acid m z 274 80811 c17h22o3 fig 5b f 2 methyl 3 methoxy 4 phenylbutyric acid m z 209 28021 c12h16o3 mmpb fig 5c g and phenylacetic acid m z 136 24501 c8h8o2 paa respectively fig 5d h 3 6 molecular mechanism of adda and its intermediates biodegradation homology modeling and molecular docking analysis suggested that aminotransferase fatty acid coa ligase and paaase contained conserved amino acid residues formed the pockets which provided possibility of active sites for these enzymes figs 6 a s3a s4a adda c20h26o4 and paa were successfully docked into the binding pockets of aminotransferase fig 6b fatty acid coa ligase fig s3b and paaase fig s4b respectively the adda connected with aminotransferase by forming conventional hydrogen bonds pi alpyl stacked and van der waals force fig 6b c among them the amino acid residues tyr132 ser100 ala39 leu243 and ala211 located in aminotransferase have strong affinity with adda fig 6c after that adda was transferred to an aromatic aliphatic hydrocarbon c20h26o4 and it was degraded further by a suit of β oxidation enzymes more specifically the c20h26o4 could form hydrogen bonds carbon hydrogen bonds and van der waals interaction with fatty acid coa ligase fig s3c similarity the paaase could activate the paa by the interactions of van der waals interaction hydrogen bonds and pi pi stacked fig s4c the paa was then converted to paa coa and the paa coa was further degraded into acetyl coa by the other paa degradation enzymes together these results indicated that the aminotransferase and β oxidation enzymes adda might have the potential to degrade adda and its intermediates which were in accordance with the transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses 3 7 identification of interested genes in three mc degrading bacteria two additional complete genome sequences of mc degrading bacterial strains were obtained the genomic features and strains information of currently sequenced mc degrading bacteria were presented in table 1 the linear comparison of mlr and its neighbor gene clusters arrangements in the genome sequences of the three mc degrading strains was generated and visualized fig 6 except for the mlr and paa gene clusters several genes related to β oxidation pathway were discovered genes encoding β oxidation enzymes such as fatty acyl coa synthase acyl coa dehydrogenase enoyl coa hydratase 3 hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenase and thiolase were highlighted in particular the genes encoding aminotransferase were discovered in these mc degrading bacteria these encoding genes might be involved in the degradation of mc lr and adda but need further verify the presence of these genes probably helps the mc degrading bacteria survive and adapt to mcs environment in a word these bacteria might be important in the mcs biodegradation and carbon nitrogen cycle for ecological balance 4 discussion mcs pollution remains a substantial public health concern and biodegradation is regarded as an effective method to reduce its prevalence however the mc lr biodegradation pathway has not been fully elucidated especially the degradation mechanisms of adda were unknown the transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles of strain yf1 were explored during adda degradation for the first time aminotransferase and β oxidation enzymes as well as some novel products involved in adda degradation were identified and validated using heterologous expression and mass spectrometry this study revealed a novel enzymatic pathway of adda degradation by sphingopyxis sp yf1 so far the degradation pathway of mc lr and its bioactive moiety adda was illustrated completely we found that the mc lr and its bioactive adda were degraded effectively by strain yf1 mass balance analysis suggested that the biodegradation was the main route for adda removal it was the first time to investigate the contribution of biosorption in adda removal furthermore we used a transcriptomic approach to identify genes encoding crucial enzymes that might be involved in adda degradation the analysis suggested that the degs of adda degradation were mainly enriched in the fatty acid degradation pathway moreover the fatty acid degradation genes nearby mlr and paa genes were focused in which many genes were significantly up regulated during adda degradation including genes encoding fatty acyl coa synthase acyl coa dehydrogenase enoyl coa hydratase 3 hydroxyacyl coa dehydrogenase and thiolase actually all of these enzymes were the well known β oxidation enzymes fujita et al 2007 additionally we found the expression of a gene encoding aminotransferase was significantly up regulated aminotransferase might play a unique role in transferring an amino group fazel and jensen 1979 liu et al 2020 palacio et al 2019 then the adda might be converted to an aromatic aliphatic hydrocarbon c20h26o4 the c20h26o4 contained a branch fatty acid and it was further degraded into paa by β oxidation enzymes the β oxidation enzymes were the main enzymes that responsible for fatty acid degradation pathway kegg reference pathway map00071 thus most of the changed genes were involved in fatty acid degradation pathway moreover many aromatic aliphatic hydrocarbons were reported to be biodegraded via the fatty acid degradation pathway gravouil et al 2017 le et al 2010 you et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 in addition the expression of genes encoding paa degradation enzymes were significantly up regulated during adda degradation paa degradation pathway was through to be the final step in the degradation of mc lr yang et al 2020 zeng et al 2021 specifically the paa was degraded into acetyl coenzyme a acetyl coa by the paa degradation enzymes which had been extensively researched in details crofts et al 2018 teufel et al 2010 the transcriptomic profiles of yf1 during adda degradation was explored for the first time and the qrt pcr results were consistent with the transcriptomic analysis therefore the aminotransferase β oxidation enzymes and paa degradation enzymes might play important roles in adda degradation furthermore the metabolomic profiles of strain yf1 during mc lr and its key bioactive moiety adda degradation were firstly investigated compared to the control groups the pantothenate and coa biosynthesis and fatty acid degradation pathway were enriched the biosynthesis coa probably played an important role in fatty acid degradation since coa was the important substance in the first step of β oxidation pathway kallscheuer et al 2017 usman et al 2022 during the β oxidation process the substrates were broken down in a repeating process by the β oxidation enzymes as aforementioned and the bond between the α carbon and β carbon atoms of the substrate were broken fig 3d each round of this process removed two carbon fragments producing acetyl coa and the intermediate with two carbon atoms fewer than the original finally the substrates were degraded to the phenylacetic acid paa and acetyl coa lynen 1953 shen and burger 2009 wakil et al 1954 metabolomics research referred to the downstream products of gene expression which directly reflected the metabolism state and degradation potential of the bacteria wright et al 2021 moreover the results were consisted with the genes expression analysis which suggested the β oxidation enzymes were important in adda biodegradation fig 7 moreover we verified that the adda were degraded efficiently by aminotransferase and β oxidation enzymes from strain yf1 using heterologous expression the genes encoding aminotransferase and β oxidation enzymes were expressed successfully and they were incubated with adda as the sole carbon nitrogen substrates the mixtures were withdrawn at different times and the degradation products were observed and identified as 7 methoxy 4 6 dimethyl 8 phenyloca 2 4 dienoic acid c17h22o3 2 methyl 3 methoxy 4 phenylbutyric acid c12h16o3 also known as mmpb and phenylacetic acid c8h8o2 also known as paa however the controls without these enzymes were unable to degrade adda which confirmed that the aminotransferase and β oxidation enzymes were important in adda biodegradation the uplc esi ms was very useful in identifying the intermediate products li et al 2022 pan et al 2021 the c17h22o3 were first found by uplc esi ms and it might be a novel product during mc lr and adda degradation in addition the c12h16o3 mmpb was identified to be an oxidative product of mcs and has been used as a marker for measuring the total concentration of mcs anaraki et al 2020 these results demonstrated that adda was subsequently degraded to paa via aminotransferase and β oxidation enzymes the adda degradation pathway was proposed firstly adda was converted into c20h26o4 by aminotransferase the molecular docking analysis confirmed the strong interactions between adda and aminotransferase although c20h26o4 was not detected using uplc esi ms due to the possible excessive reaction rate and present mass spectrum conditions molecular docking has emerged as a powerful tool to explore the interactions of the corresponding substrates and enzymes and has been widely applied to investigate the degradation potential and mechanism of enzymes toward substrates cai et al 2022 chu et al 2022 li et al 2022 secondly the c20h26o4 was degraded into c17h22o3 c15h20o3 c12h16o3 mmpb and c8h8o2 paa in turns via four rounds of β oxidation the interactions between c20h26o4 and the fatty acid coa ligase the first enzymes of β oxidation pathway were confirmed by molecular docking finally paa was degraded via the ppa degradation pathway which have illustrated previously crofts et al 2018 teufel et al 2010 yang et al 2020 moreover our results suggested that the paa interacted with paaase by a series of intermolecular forces these results were in accordance with the multi omics analysis and these findings confirmed that the aminotransferase β oxidation enzymes and paa degradation enzymes played major degradation roles in the process of adda removal therefore the adda were not the final bio products of mc lr previous study also proposed that the co2 as a major end product of mc lr hyenstrand et al 2003 this study illustrated a novel enzymatic pathway of adda biodegradation in which the toxic mcs and adda were removed to lower than the limit of detection of uplc furthermore these determined products from adda biodegradation will be validated using the isotope labeling technique in future comparative genomics analysis could be used to characterize the gene function and metabolic potential of bacteria wang et al 2020 there were seven strains of mc degrading bacteria and their genomes were released but only three of them had their complete genomes sequenced up to now these mc degrading bacteria had multiple col linear genome fragments and each bacterium had many distinct genome sections proteins involved in these metabolic pathways were most likely essential for the basic biology and phenotype of bacteria as well as their adaptation to mc contaminated environments not only were the common mlr and paa gene clusters found in the three bacteria but the genes encoding aminotransferase and a suite of β oxidation enzymes were also found these important genes were investigated and highlighted in the genome of mc degrading bacteria for the first time it is plausible that the mlr pathway β oxidation process paa metabolism probably could provide energy sources and regulatory factors for bacterial growth survival and adaptation in the toxic environment due to the limited genome of mc degrading bacteria the mcs and paa metabolic potential of three genomes of mlr mc degrading bacteria were roughly explored previously zhang et al 2020 these mc degrading species might be relationship in the carbon cycle and ecological equilibrium the relationship between the strain yf1 and other mc degrading bacteria is still requiring to further exploration in summary a novel degradation pathway of mc lr was revealed especially the new enzymatic pathway of adda degradation was elucidated fig 8 sphingopyxis sp yf1 could successively degrade the environmental pollutants mc lr into adda by mlrabc enzymes then adda was into c20h26o4 c17h22o3 c12h16o3 mmpb and c8h8o2 paa by aminotransferase and β oxidation enzymes later the paa was degraded into acetyl coa by paaagzje enzymes the acetyl coa was further converted to final nontoxic co2 through the tca cycle which was a common metabolic pathway that happened in many organisms van rossum et al 2016 elucidation of the complete pathway was not only important in understanding the molecular mechanism of mc lr and adda degradation but also suggested the properties of the mc degrading bacteria in the ecological carbon cycle moreover the bacteria could be easily recycled and reused when it is immobilized in some supporting materials such as chitosan magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles carbon nanotubes graphite oxide etc wu et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 these materials might possess great catalytic ability stability and reusability which improved the efficiency of organic pollutants degradation kumar et al 2020 liu et al 2016 pan et al 2018 the bacterial strain yf1 combined with the immobilized materials may be a promising strategy to control mcs pollution in the field environment in the future using the principle of synthetic biology to transform these enzymes into a useful product might be meaningful in treatment mcs and adda pollution our findings provide new insights into the biological methods for the remediation of mcs pollution in water bodies 5 conclusion the complete mc lr degradation mechanisms especially the novel enzymatic pathways of adda degradation were elucidated via systematically integrated multi omics analysis mass spectrometry heterologous expression molecular docking and comparative genomic analysis mc lr was degraded into adda by mlrabc enzymes then adda was degraded into paa by the aminotransferase and β oxidation enzymes the paa was further degraded by paa degradation enzymes then acetyl coa was produced and it was transferred to the final co2 the enzymatic pathways of adda degradation were illustrated for the first time which enriched the biodegradation mechanisms and pathways of mc lr these findings will contribute to the application of microbes on mcs polluted water bodies in future credit authorship contribution statement jia wei

15208,colloidal particles can attach to surfaces during transport but the attachment depends on particle size hydrodynamics solid and water chemistry and particulate matter the attachment is quantified in filtration theory by measuring attachment or sticking efficiency alpha a comprehensive alpha database 2538 records was built from experiments in the literature and used to develop a machine learning ml model to predict alpha the training r squared 0 86 was performed using two random forests capable of handling missing data a holdout dataset was used to validate the training r squared 0 98 and the variable importance was explored for training and validation finally an additional validation dataset was built from quartz crystal microbalance experiments using surface modified polystyrene poly methyl methacrylate and polyethylene the experiments were performed in the absence or presence of humic acid full database regression r squared 0 90 predicted alpha for the additional validation with an r squared of 0 23 nevertheless when the original database and the additional validation dataset were combined into a new database both the training r squared 0 95 and validation r squared 0 70 increased the developed ml model provides a data driven prediction of alpha over a big database and evaluates the significance of 22 input variables graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords attachment efficiency machine learning missing data colloid deposition data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction particle transport occurs between air terrestrial and aquatic compartments because they are interconnected guo et al 2020 horton and dixon 2018 koutnik et al 2021 attachment of particles to soil grains and sediments during transport is important in the soil subsurface and aquatic compartments kim and walker 2009 koutnik et al 2021 li et al 2020 the attachment efficiency alpha expresses the probability of particles sticking to surfaces after collision bradford et al 2014 petosa et al 2010 environmental fate modeling efm has been developed to simulate the distribution of particles in compartments and uses alpha as a critical parameter to predict the attachment of particles to soil and sediments krol et al 2013 meesters et al 2014 efm is commonly used for engineered nanoparticles meesters et al 2014 suhendra et al 2020 and some microplastics besseling et al 2017 for convenience various efms have been assumed alpha values but the use of experimentally calculated alpha leads to a more realistic efm alpha is a value obtained from experimental data and its advantages and disadvantages have been discussed elsewhere cornelis 2015 landkamer et al 2013 however the use of alpha in efm is limited to its availability for various conditions of particle surface chemistry water chemistry and hydrodynamics thus prediction tools for estimating alpha can be developed to address those limitations moreover these tools can provide valuable information on the effects of input variables on alpha helping to interpret attachment behaviors to our knowledge there is only one pure empirical effort to predict alpha in the literature park et al 2012 but limitations of experimental conditions remain in detail park et al 2012 used data from six articles to predict alpha for c parvum oocysts in packed columns using linear regression of the inverse debye length and ph the predictive ability of this empirically determined linear model was tested using alpha from 3 other articles the r squared of predictions ranged from 0 71 to 0 76 indicating that ionic strength is and ph including a few records cannot fully capture alpha s behavior it was suggested that including variables such as natural organic matter nom coating content on sand grains grain size distribution porosity pore water velocity and oocyst properties can improve the predictive ability this was a case specific modeling because it is challenging to predict alpha over wider experimental conditions the literature commonly presents is and nom as the most dominant variables influencing particle attachment proposing mechanisms such as electrostatic repulsion or electrosteric repulsion but it is uncommon to qualitatively and systematically examine the importance of these and other variables lin et al 2010 yu et al 2018 similarly machine learning ml has been used to predict particle transport behavior in packed columns goldberg et al 2015 sangani et al 2019 contrary to mechanistic modeling e g equations derived from first principles ml is a flexible empirical modeling approach that accounts for multiple variables and correlations goldberg et al 2015 developed a regression between 17 physicochemical variables and the retained particle fraction using a random forest rf algorithm the rf algorithm applied on a database comprising 175 records from 20 articles yielded about 0 04 error prediction the top 5 important variables influencing the retained particle fraction behavior were influent pore volume nom concentration particle zeta potential collector zeta potential and particle density similarly sangani et al 2019 developed a regression between 31 physicochemical variables and the transported and retained particle mass of tio2 nanoparticles using four ml algorithms multiple linear regression decision tree rf and neural network a database consisting of 270 records was built from packed column experiments and it was found that a neural network algorithm r squared 0 90 0 93 had slightly greater predictive ability than a rf algorithm r squared 0 84 0 92 additionally grain diameter particle hydrodynamic diameter preferential flow ph and is were the top 5 variables influencing the transported particle mass whereas particle hydrodynamic diameter grain diameter grain aggregate diameter ph and cation exchange capacity influenced the retained particle mass however a few records hamper the prediction and analysis of alpha from databases the database size for ml is important because ml performance can significantly vary according to the size and ml methods jiao et al 2020 ling and templeton 2015 zhang and ling 2018 note that neural networks applied in robust commercial applications e g amazon and google use large databases with millions of records thus we used supervised ml to predict alpha using rfs on a large database of physicochemical hydrodynamic and operational conditions moreover we gave a considerable generalized understanding of variable behavior and importance we aim to increase ml efforts in the colloid science field but we do not state that our results are absolute presently air terrestrial and aquatic microplastic contamination is a global issue akanyange et al 2021 harris 2020 tang et al 2021 yang et al 2021 microplastics in the compartments are 0 1 μm 5 mm particles originated from bigger plastic products e g plastic chunks or bags including microplastics made for use in products e g plastic microbeads for toothpaste or cosmetics li et al 2020 pico and barcelo 2019 wu et al 2019 the primordial source of microplastic particles is human activity in terrestrial compartments for example microplastics in plastic mulch for agriculture consisting of polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene pe can be transported into the subsurface li et al 2020 yang et al 2021 subsurface transport occurs when water e g rainfall drags microplastics from the soil surface to deeper soil layers and underground water guo et al 2020 horton and dixon 2018 koutnik et al 2021 li et al 2020 column experiments using various grain types reported that cotransported organic matter behentrimonium chloride and sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate increased pe and polypropylene transport whereas cotransported e coli or b subtilis decreased carboxylate modified microplastics transport ren et al 2021 hence we were motivated to perform quartz crystal with microbalance qcm d experiments using surface modified polystyrene ps pe and poly methyl methacrylate pmma microplastic particles in two conditions of humic acid i e in the presence and absence of humic acid these experiments were used to build a dataset for additional validation of the ml model 2 materials and methods 2 1 database an online search in the web of science using the keyword attachment efficiency was conducted in july 2021 to collect peer reviewed articles and build a comprehensive database in r version 4 1 3 in rstudio desktop version 2021 09 0 351 the database comprised 2538 records mined from 74 articles covering research from 1992 to 2021 only articles reporting alpha were collected and a list of the mined articles is shown in table s1 of the supplementary information si for each record 22 variables were considered to predict alpha table 1 shows a summary of the input variables the database included 10 physicochemical variables pt pt coating pt hdiam pt h11 ph salt is pt zeta coll zeta and pt ca see table 1 for the description of abbreviations and 12 hydrodynamic operational variables coll diam coll area pt rho nom nom add nom conc system flow vel pt conc re and pe see table 1 for the description of abbreviations table 1 shows that the database contains a wide range of attachment conditions both re and pe numbers account for vel but we decided to include them as inputs because re essentially characterized fluid forces whereas pe characterized mass transfer rastegar and gu 2017 additionally alpha was not constrained in 0 1 to reflect what the literature was reporting fig 1 shows a map of missing input data which shows that 16 of the input data is missing mostly from pt ca coll zeta pt h11 pt zeta and pt hdiam although pt ca is almost always missing we decided to include it as input according to the extended derjaguin landau verwey and overbeek xdlvo theory because it characterized lewis s acid base interactions hydrophobic interactions that are important for strongly hydrophilic e g sio2 or hydrophobic particles e g methylated sio2 and pe han et al 2022 moreover pt ca was included to test ml s abilities in handling significant missing data descriptive statistics of all the variables were explored table 2 summarizes the descriptive statistical analysis of the input variables in this study the variables comprised 6 categorical pt pt coating salt nom nom add and system and 16 numerical pt hdiam coll diam coll area pt rho pt h11 ph is pt zeta coll zeta pt ca nom conc flow vel pt conc re and pe types table 2 shows that ps was most frequent under pt but bacteria e g a paradoux viruses e g ms2 oxides e g al2o3 composites e g zns cdse and engineered particles e g c60 were also common under pt interestingly other plastic types were not reported bare particle was the most frequent particle surface modification none under pt coating but other coatings such as citrate e g au stabilizer carboxyl e g plastic stabilizer fe and humic acid were also included salt contains monovalent e g na1 divalent e g ca2 and trivalent e g fe3 ions as well as mixed ions e g artificial groundwater a value of none the most frequent type under nom denotes the absence of organic matters or surfactants other nom types included organic matter fractions e g suwanee river humic acid srha specific organic matters e g george town nom surfactants polymers e g alginate lipids e g cholesterol bacteria viruses and clay suspended particulate matter can be a variable name created to include only bacteria viruses and clay following this logic other variable names can be created for extracellular polymeric substances surfactants polymers etc however we believe that these unnecessarily generate sparse matrices high cardinality in the database making analysis tedious for simplicity we lumped them under nom and rf algorithms will make correct tree decisions when nom types are encountered nom add included none nom was not added in a system in solution collector coating and both in solution and coating the variable system included single particle and surrogate collector measurement e g surface force apparatus or atomic force microscope batch only attachment systems having micro nanoparticles and centimeter sized collector particles cell e g flow cell chamber packed with collector qcm d and packed column the most frequent type from measured force data alpha values in single can be calculated by first using the nonlinear poisson equation to fit force data and find electrostatic contributions that give the debye length electrostatic contributions are subtracted from the total force to find van der waals contributions that give the hamaker constant second the debye length and hamaker constant are used in alpha models from colloid filtration theory patino et al 2020 similarly the boltzman factor equation uses the maximum dlvo energy barriers to calculate alpha wang et al 2019 the calculated coefficients of variation cvs for nom conc flow vel re and pe indicate their high diversity cv 5 15 table 2 whereas other numerical variables had low diversity cv 0 3 table 2 high diversity is desired for generalized modeling sangani et al 2019 note that the cv values depend on the experimental conditions chosen by researchers who choose them based on realistic or equipment limitations nonetheless a database with more diverse experimental conditions would be useful skewness showed that the numerical variables were considerably skewed to the left positive skewness values except for pt zeta coll zeta and pt ca which were skewed to the right and pt diam pt h11 and flow which seemed normally distributed for most of the numerical variables the median was less than the mean confirming skewness to the left except for pt h11 all numerical variables had nonzero kurtosis showing a nonnormal distribution with a sharp peak thin shoulders and thick tails both the anderson darling and kolmogorov smirnov tests at 0 1 significance level confirmed that all numerical variables had nonnormal distributions additionally fig 2 shows numerical variable distributions since the value of alpha is averaged over different spatial and temporal scales in various experimental types the database used to train rfs may be biased to a common experimental scale or input variable set moreover distributions of some input variables look single valued because most of their values are inside narrow ranges fig 2 suggesting possible biases thus variable scaling was used to avoid such biases due to varying scales and distributions in the numerical variables a logarithmic base 10 scaling was performed for data preprocessing except for ph which is already logarithmically scaled and pt zeta and coll zeta which were scaled to the thousandth due to their negative value similarly because of high cardinality in some categorical variables we used leave one out target encoding to encode the categorical variables followed by logarithm base 10 scaling 2 2 database modeling database modeling was conducted in r using rf as the supervised ml because rf can handle missing data tang and ishwaran 2017 two rf algorithms chosen for handling missing data were fast unified rfs for survival regression and classification rfsrc and nonparametric missing value imputation using rfs missforest rfsrc imputes missing data as the forest grows on the fly imputation whereas missforest uses a fitted forest from regressing each variable against all other variables to predict missing data preimputation in each variable tang and ishwaran 2017 before splitting the database into training 1775 records 70 and holdout 763 records 30 datasets seven random seeds were used to shuffle the records pt ca is expected to introduce considerable noise because of its large missing data accordingly the following cases were explored for training regression and holdout prediction 1 rfsrc without pt ca 2 rfsrc with pt ca 3 missforest without pt ca and 4 missforest with pt ca note that missforest is a preimputation algorithm thus the imputed database from missforest was used in rfsrc for consistency when the database has no missing data rfsrc does not use its imputation algorithm rfsrc hyperparameters had 1000 trees 10 splits 3 iterations for missing data imputed and 7 random seeds similarly missforest hyperparameters had 1000 trees the performance of rfsrc was evaluated using the r squared measure which is calculated using cross validated mean squared error out of bag error method and variance variable importance was evaluated by assigning out of bag cases to the opposite tree split anti in rfsrc parameters our study did not include hyperparameter optimization fig 3 summarizes our modeling approach 3 results and discussion 3 1 regression and prediction of the attachment efficiency fig 4 shows the r squared values for training and validation according to rf algorithm and pt ca cases pt ca is a good example of missing data in real databases which can be caused by poor data reporting database corruption etc and we aimed to portray the literature with great fidelity see missingness map in fig 1 for two given cases i e r squared values of training with and without pt ca were similar for rfsrc cases 1 and 2 validation r squared prediction improved without pt ca because the noise i e missing values from pt ca was removed for missforest preimputation followed by rfsrc cases 3 and 4 validation r squared only slightly decreased without pt ca showing that pt ca can be incorporated in ml modeling in the database pt ca was only reported for bacteria for characterization and attachment mechanism jacobs et al 2007 and walker et al 2006 reported that hydrophobicity influences bacteria attachment whereas li et al 2014 and lutterodt et al 2014 reported the opposite pt ca for other particles were unreported in the used articles but it is expected that surfaces in natural systems can readily interact with organic matter and thus investigating pt ca range can reflect reality as shown in fig 4 the importance of pt ca for capturing and predicting the behavior of alpha is low nevertheless more observed data are required because this variable largely contains missing data and its importance is inconclusive fig 4 also shows the variable importance the top 5 important variables were selected for a given case and used for i discussions and to ii conduct additional training and validation for rfsrc cases 1 and 2 the r squared values of both training and validation decreased when only the top 5 variables were used indicating that the rfsrc benefited from the rest of the variables to satisfactorily capture alpha s behavior for missforest preimputation followed by rfsrc cases 3 and 4 the training r squared improved when only the top 5 variables were used whereas the validation r squared decreased this shows that incorporating more variables can help in capturing and predicting the behavior of alpha comparing cases in fig 4 shows that missforest s preimputation performed significantly better than rfsrc s on the fly imputation tang and ishwaran 2017 reported that missforest outperformed rfsrc and other missing data imputation algorithms for ml modeling case 3 missforest preimputation with pt ca and rfsrc was chosen for further ml modeling based on case 3 the selected top 5 important variables were system nom add nom pt zeta and nom conc the variable system contained batch flow cell column qcm d and single particle the hydrodynamics mass transfer average volume area and controlling mechanisms can be different according to system type however lumping these types in system is possible because the rf will make the correct decision when system types are encountered fig 3 shows how r squared values are calculated for system types and added to an overall r squared for the variable system the average alpha was in the order of single 0 09 cell 0 29 column 0 31 qcm d 0 45 and batch 0 56 thus the challenge is to select system types that closely recreate natural conditions because one type may not generalize to all ml modeling by system type was performed as shown in fig 5 i for batch column and single the r squared of training and validation increased as data size increased ii the effects of outliers in the prediction decreased as the data size increased alpha was not constrained to 0 1 because rf algorithms are robust to outliers russell and norvig 2020 alpha can be calculated by dividing the attachment rate under electrostatically hindered is conditions by that under electrostatically favorable conditions surface modifications surface modifications of the collector are required for the favorable conditions but they imply other attachment mechanisms such as surface roughness choi et al 2015 which influence ideal favorable attachment and thus alpha values 1 can be calculated iii column has the biggest data size because most researchers run column experiments note that the literature reports case specific trends limited to particle types and experimental conditions we report trends across particle types and experimental conditions iv the number of missing data in cell and qcm d decreased resulting in higher r squared values for training and validation finally we present a varying degree of variable importance to each system type but explaining their importance requires case specific mechanisms that are beyond the scope of our study we provide fig 5 as a guide for researchers nom add contained none absence in solution collector coating and both in solution and collector coating averages of alpha according to nom add were in the order of both 0 11 coating 0 28 none 0 32 and in solution 0 37 interestingly averaged alpha was similar when nom add was none 0 32 and in solution 0 37 in the literature geitner et al 2017 jones and su 2012 alpha seems to be largely influenced by additives mixed in solution because these in solution can interact with other surfaces adsorbing onto them adsorbed layers can generate steric repulsion or bridging and they can be further compressed conformation changes at relatively high is increasing alpha to near that of bare surfaces bradford et al 2021 kim et al 2009 pham et al 2009 note that increasing is also decreases pt zeta leading to weaker electrostatic force and accordingly at some conditions reaching favorable interaction that makes alpha similar to none conditions when nom add is none pt zeta plays a role in the attachment conversely for both and coating averaged alphas considerably decreased this agreed with the widely known repulsive steric effects originating from additives philippe and schaumann 2014 turner et al 2020 additionally nom comprised 41 types table 1 and influenced alpha according to the type e g suwanee river fulvic acid tween 20 and srha and their concentration nom conc researchers have been interested in the role of organic matter surfactants or other surface modifying additives e g contaminants in particle deposition cornelis et al 2014 johnson et al 1996 philippe and schaumann 2014 fig 6 shows spearman s correlation coefficients at 0 1 significance level of the database imputed with missforest the coefficients were clustered hierarchically based on ward s minimum variance method which squared dissimilarities before clustering spearman s correlation showed the strength and direction of a monotonic not strictly linear correlation the top 5 variables system nom add nom pt zeta and nom conc had interactions with other variables and thus alpha was the result of these interactions the correlation between system type and nom addition type was positive but very weak as shown in fig 6 the correlation between nom addition type and nom type was positive and moderate as previously mentioned the nom addition type contained four individual initial experimental conditions none in solution coating and both we acknowledge that in solution under the nom addition type can generate surface coating influencing surface charge consequently higher repulsive conditions than those in only one side coating coating can occur nevertheless simultaneously occurring coating of both particle surface and collector surface due to in solution under the nom addition type are two mechanisms that cannot be easily decoupled and expressed in the database moreover there is a positive but weak correlation between the nom type and nom concentration as shown in fig 6 finally the correlation between nom addition type and particle charge was negative and weak because particle charge is also a function of electrophoretic mobility inverse debye length and particle hydrodynamic diameter e g reported zeta potential values are commonly calculated using smoluchowski s equation labib and williams 1984 sze et al 2003 system type did not correlate with particle charge because this is affected by water and surface chemistry interestingly there was no correlation between the nom type and particle charge but the opposite was expected the influence of the nom type might be reflected through other mechanisms such as steric repulsion or bridging moreover particle charge had a weak positive correlation with alpha literature reports that the dlvo theory predicts higher alpha as particle charge decreases becomes less negative because of reduced electrostatic repulsion bolster et al 2010 tufenkji and elimelech 2005 however according to the literature particle charge alone is insufficient to capture alpha s behavior as there is no direct correlation between them foppen et al 2010 li et al 2014 3 2 microplastic attachment experiments for validation qcm d experiments pt hdiam pt zeta coll zeta and pt ca measurements and pt h11 calculation were used to generate an additional validation dataset of 45 microplastic attachment records the validation dataset is provided in an excel file uploaded separately qcm d experiments were performed with carboxyl coated ps carboxyl coated pmma and tween 20 coated pe microplastics in the absence of srha in the presence of in solution srha and srha coated collector i e coated qcm d sensor in the presence of in solution srha notably various experimental conditions were totally new to the ml at this stage this was deliberately done to test its predictive abilities for example pmma pe and tween 20 coating were totally new data and a 0 5 ml min flow rate was very uncommon in qcm d experiments the si contains information regarding materials qcm d experiments other measurements and calculations fig 7 shows that training on the entire database increased r squared compared to split datasets in fig 4 nevertheless the validation was poor r squared of 0 23 0 06 because there were too few qcm d records in the training database for good learning and predictions out of 207 records 0 contained plastics under pt 0 contained carboxyl or tween 20 coatings under pt coating 4 contained in solution under nom add 10 contained both under nom add and 8 contained srha under nom however these variables are important in a qcm d system fig 5 and result in low predictive ability additionally the validation dataset was merged into the original database 2538 records to expand it 2583 records the expanded database was randomly split into training 70 and holdout 30 datasets the r squared values of both training and validation considerably increased fig 7 thus it is important to improve the database with complete records fewer missing data and microplastic data to enhance the predictive power of the additional experimental validation dataset 4 limitations and implications of the present study experimental alpha values in our database mined from the literature reflect the collective effect of many variables including the 22 studied and those that were neglected which will be briefly discussed in this section note that the contributions of the 22 variables to alpha values were explicitly acknowledged whereas those of other neglected variables remain implicit and depend on reported data there are distributions heterogeneity in size charge contact angle density etc that influence transport and retention for example nanoscale heterogeneities e g roughness parameters clay coating and charge heterogeneity were neglected in the current set of input variables yet influence the attachment variables characterizing surface nanoroughness on particles e g roughness fraction or root mean square average height could have been included bradford et al 2018 however surface roughness was unreported in the collected 74 articles some removal processes are also a function of the colloid concentration e g hydrodynamic bridging specific transport and retention mechanisms such as advection straining and blocking are also important but were neglected in the input bradford and bettahar 2005 homoaggregation heteroaggregation cation bridging polymer bridging and disaggregation were neglected han et al 2016 kim et al 2009 philippe and schaumann 2014 for example particle aggregation with clays organic matter or contaminants has been largely considered for modeling aquatic compartments de klein et al 2016 praetorius et al 2012 particle shape influences particle attachment by manipulating the dlvo energy barrier according to particle orientation gomez flores et al 2020 gomez flores et al 2019 similarly microplastic shape also affects their environmental transport koutnik et al 2021 the literature rarely reports or considers some of these other variables e g surface roughness charge heterogeneity and straining because they are difficult to quantify but alternatively some of them e g advection straining and blocking can be included as categorical variables in the input additionally our study is limited to saturated conditions that occur in groundwater and soils following ponded conditions however root and vadose attachment behaviors differ under unsaturated conditions due to air water interfaces cornelis 2015 keller et al 2020 some researchers may prefer mechanistic modeling over our empirical approach nevertheless empirical modeling has the advantage of handling multivariable and nonlinear processes over large amounts of data with relatively lower computational power instead of just one small specific dataset that researchers normally use we used a big dataset to prove the importance of 22 variables predict alpha and draw conclusions mechanistic modeling including semi empirical modeling and our ai based empirical modeling have different starting points these are first principles and experimental data respectively mechanistic modeling neglects variables for simplicity but neglecting variables that exist in real environment may be improper before systematic importance studies notably our database reflects the complexity of reality by using experimentally measured alpha values we envision that our database can be continuously expanded our modeling can readily provide alpha values predicted from experimental data without any experiments for practical applications using efm 5 conclusions it was found that missforest pre imputation followed by rfsrc was a successful method for handling missing data and making predictions literature poorly reported particle contact angle collector zeta potential particle hamaker constant particle zeta potential and particle hydrodynamic diameter producing missing data variable importance studies showed that system additive e g organic matter or surfactants addition additive type particle zeta potential and additive concentration were the top 5 important variables influencing alpha behavior variable correlation study indicated that alpha is influenced by multicorrelation and nonlinearity it was found that prediction ability increased as data increased hyperparameter optimization in the two rf algorithms or the use of other ml models neural networks genetic algorithms etc are options to further improve predictions alternatively mechanistic modeling might be used for predicting alpha over a wide range of experimental conditions and for comparison with our approach nevertheless input variables and complexity of mechanistic modeling limit its application in our database conversely our modeling better reflects reality because predicts based on experimental data which is useful for more realistic efm but requires more of this data mechanistic modeling makes simplifications neglecting variables that may be important it is impractical to include all variables in mechanistic modeling but machine learning modeling can handle many variables and find their importance our approach and results are not absolute but we propose an empirical data drive approach to make generalizations and predictions including case specific conditions supporting information a list of the peer reviewed articles mined for building the database

2018 note that neural networks applied in robust commercial applications e g amazon and google use large databases with millions of records thus we used supervised ml to predict alpha using rfs on a large database of physicochemical hydrodynamic and operational conditions moreover we gave a considerable generalized understanding of variable behavior and importance we aim to increase ml efforts in the colloid science field but we do not state that our results are absolute presently air terrestrial and aquatic microplastic contamination is a global issue akanyange et al 2021 harris 2020 tang et al 2021 yang et al 2021 microplastics in the compartments are 0 1 μm 5 mm particles originated from bigger plastic products e g plastic chunks or bags including microplastics made for use in products e g plastic microbeads for toothpaste or cosmetics li et al 2020 pico and barcelo 2019 wu et al 2019 the primordial source of microplastic particles is human activity in terrestrial compartments for example microplastics in plastic mulch for agriculture consisting of polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene pe can be transported into the subsurface li et al 2020 yang et al 2021 subsurface transport occurs when water e g rainfall drags microplastics from the soil surface to deeper soil layers and underground water guo et al 2020 horton and dixon 2018 koutnik et al 2021 li et al 2020 column experiments using various grain types reported that cotransported organic matter behentrimonium chloride and sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate increased pe and polypropylene transport whereas cotransported e coli or b subtilis decreased carboxylate modified microplastics transport ren et al 2021 hence we were motivated to perform quartz crystal with microbalance qcm d experiments using surface modified polystyrene ps pe and poly methyl methacrylate pmma microplastic particles in two conditions of humic acid i e in the presence and absence of humic acid these experiments were used to build a dataset for additional validation of the ml model 2 materials and methods 2 1 database an online search in the web of science using the keyword attachment efficiency was conducted in july 2021 to collect peer reviewed articles and build a comprehensive database in r version 4 1 3 in rstudio desktop version 2021 09 0 351 the database comprised 2538 records mined from 74 articles covering research from 1992 to 2021 only articles reporting alpha were collected and a list of the mined articles is shown in table s1 of the supplementary information si for each record 22 variables were considered to predict alpha table 1 shows a summary of the input variables the database included 10 physicochemical variables pt pt coating pt hdiam pt h11 ph salt is pt zeta coll zeta and pt ca see table 1 for the description of abbreviations and 12 hydrodynamic operational variables coll diam coll area pt rho nom nom add nom conc system flow vel pt conc re and pe see table 1 for the description of abbreviations table 1 shows that the database contains a wide range of attachment conditions both re and pe numbers account for vel but we decided to include them as inputs because re essentially characterized fluid forces whereas pe characterized mass transfer rastegar and gu 2017 additionally alpha was not constrained in 0 1 to reflect what the literature was reporting fig 1 shows a map of missing input data which shows that 16 of the input data is missing mostly from pt ca coll zeta pt h11 pt zeta and pt hdiam although pt ca is almost always missing we decided to include it as input according to the extended derjaguin landau verwey and overbeek xdlvo theory because it characterized lewis s acid base interactions hydrophobic interactions that are important for strongly hydrophilic e g sio2 or hydrophobic particles e g methylated sio2 and pe han et al 2022 moreover pt ca was included to test ml s abilities in handling significant missing data descriptive statistics of all the variables were explored table 2 summarizes the descriptive statistical analysis of the input variables in this study the variables comprised 6 categorical pt pt coating salt nom nom add and system and 16 numerical pt hdiam coll diam coll area pt rho pt h11 ph is pt zeta coll zeta pt ca nom conc flow vel pt conc re and pe types table 2 shows that ps was most frequent under pt but bacteria e g a paradoux viruses e g ms2 oxides e g al2o3 composites e g zns cdse and engineered particles e g c60 were also common under pt interestingly other plastic types were not reported bare particle was the most frequent particle surface modification none under pt coating but other coatings such as citrate e g au stabilizer carboxyl e g plastic stabilizer fe and humic acid were also included salt contains monovalent e g na1 divalent e g ca2 and trivalent e g fe3 ions as well as mixed ions e g artificial groundwater a value of none the most frequent type under nom denotes the absence of organic matters or surfactants other nom types included organic matter fractions e g suwanee river humic acid srha specific organic matters e g george town nom surfactants polymers e g alginate lipids e g cholesterol bacteria viruses and clay suspended particulate matter can be a variable name created to include only bacteria viruses and clay following this logic other variable names can be created for extracellular polymeric substances surfactants polymers etc however we believe that these unnecessarily generate sparse matrices high cardinality in the database making analysis tedious for simplicity we lumped them under nom and rf algorithms will make correct tree decisions when nom types are encountered nom add included none nom was not added in a system in solution collector coating and both in solution and coating the variable system included single particle and surrogate collector measurement e g surface force apparatus or atomic force microscope batch only attachment systems having micro nanoparticles and centimeter sized collector particles cell e g flow cell chamber packed with collector qcm d and packed column the most frequent type from measured force data alpha values in single can be calculated by first using the nonlinear poisson equation to fit force data and find electrostatic contributions that give the debye length electrostatic contributions are subtracted from the total force to find van der waals contributions that give the hamaker constant second the debye length and hamaker constant are used in alpha models from colloid filtration theory patino et al 2020 similarly the boltzman factor equation uses the maximum dlvo energy barriers to calculate alpha wang et al 2019 the calculated coefficients of variation cvs for nom conc flow vel re and pe indicate their high diversity cv 5 15 table 2 whereas other numerical variables had low diversity cv 0 3 table 2 high diversity is desired for generalized modeling sangani et al 2019 note that the cv values depend on the experimental conditions chosen by researchers who choose them based on realistic or equipment limitations nonetheless a database with more diverse experimental conditions would be useful skewness showed that the numerical variables were considerably skewed to the left positive skewness values except for pt zeta coll zeta and pt ca which were skewed to the right and pt diam pt h11 and flow which seemed normally distributed for most of the numerical variables the median was less than the mean confirming skewness to the left except for pt h11 all numerical variables had nonzero kurtosis showing a nonnormal distribution with a sharp peak thin shoulders and thick tails both the anderson darling and kolmogorov smirnov tests at 0 1 significance level confirmed that all numerical variables had nonnormal distributions additionally fig 2 shows numerical variable distributions since the value of alpha is averaged over different spatial and temporal scales in various experimental types the database used to train rfs may be biased to a common experimental scale or input variable set moreover distributions of some input variables look single valued because most of their values are inside narrow ranges fig 2 suggesting possible biases thus variable scaling was used to avoid such biases due to varying scales and distributions in the numerical variables a logarithmic base 10 scaling was performed for data preprocessing except for ph which is already logarithmically scaled and pt zeta and coll zeta which were scaled to the thousandth due to their negative value similarly because of high cardinality in some categorical variables we used leave one out target encoding to encode the categorical variables followed by logarithm base 10 scaling 2 2 database modeling database modeling was conducted in r using rf as the supervised ml because rf can handle missing data tang and ishwaran 2017 two rf algorithms chosen for handling missing data were fast unified rfs for survival regression and classification rfsrc and nonparametric missing value imputation using rfs missforest rfsrc imputes missing data as the forest grows on the fly imputation whereas missforest uses a fitted forest from regressing each variable against all other variables to predict missing data preimputation in each variable tang and ishwaran 2017 before splitting the database into training 1775 records 70 and holdout 763 records 30 datasets seven random seeds were used to shuffle the records pt ca is expected to introduce considerable noise because of its large missing data accordingly the following cases were explored for training regression and holdout prediction 1 rfsrc without pt ca 2 rfsrc with pt ca 3 missforest without pt ca and 4 missforest with pt ca note that missforest is a preimputation algorithm thus the imputed database from missforest was used in rfsrc for consistency when the database has no missing data rfsrc does not use its imputation algorithm rfsrc hyperparameters had 1000 trees 10 splits 3 iterations for missing data imputed and 7 random seeds similarly missforest hyperparameters had 1000 trees the performance of rfsrc was evaluated using the r squared measure which is calculated using cross validated mean squared error out of bag error method and variance variable importance was evaluated by assigning out of bag cases to the opposite tree split anti in rfsrc parameters our study did not include hyperparameter optimization fig 3 summarizes our modeling approach 3 results and discussion 3 1 regression and prediction of the attachment efficiency fig 4 shows the r squared values for training and validation according to rf algorithm and pt ca cases pt ca is a good example of missing data in real databases which can be caused by poor data reporting database corruption etc and we aimed to portray the literature with great fidelity see missingness map in fig 1 for two given cases i e r squared values of training with and without pt ca were similar for rfsrc cases 1 and 2 validation r squared prediction improved without pt ca because the noise i e missing values from pt ca was removed for missforest preimputation followed by rfsrc cases 3 and 4 validation r squared only slightly decreased without pt ca showing that pt ca can be incorporated in ml modeling in the database pt ca was only reported for bacteria for characterization and attachment mechanism jacobs et al 2007 and walker et al 2006 reported that hydrophobicity influences bacteria attachment whereas li et al 2014 and lutterodt et al 2014 reported the opposite pt ca for other particles were unreported in the used articles but it is expected that surfaces in natural systems can readily interact with organic matter and thus investigating pt ca range can reflect reality as shown in fig 4 the importance of pt ca for capturing and predicting the behavior of alpha is low nevertheless more observed data are required because this variable largely contains missing data and its importance is inconclusive fig 4 also shows the variable importance the top 5 important variables were selected for a given case and used for i discussions and to ii conduct additional training and validation for rfsrc cases 1 and 2 the r squared values of both training and validation decreased when only the top 5 variables were used indicating that the rfsrc benefited from the rest of the variables to satisfactorily capture alpha s behavior for missforest preimputation followed by rfsrc cases 3 and 4 the training r squared improved when only the top 5 variables were used whereas the validation r squared decreased this shows that incorporating more variables can help in capturing and predicting the behavior of alpha comparing cases in fig 4 shows that missforest s preimputation performed significantly better than rfsrc s on the fly imputation tang and ishwaran 2017 reported that missforest outperformed rfsrc and other missing data imputation algorithms for ml modeling case 3 missforest preimputation with pt ca and rfsrc was chosen for further ml modeling based on case 3 the selected top 5 important variables were system nom add nom pt zeta and nom conc the variable system contained batch flow cell column qcm d and single particle the hydrodynamics mass transfer average volume area and controlling mechanisms can be different according to system type however lumping these types in system is possible because the rf will make the correct decision when system types are encountered fig 3 shows how r squared values are calculated for system types and added to an overall r squared for the variable system the average alpha was in the order of single 0 09 cell 0 29 column 0 31 qcm d 0 45 and batch 0 56 thus the challenge is to select system types that closely recreate natural conditions because one type may not generalize to all ml modeling by system type was performed as shown in fig 5 i for batch column and single the r squared of training and validation increased as data size increased ii the effects of outliers in the prediction decreased as the data size increased alpha was not constrained to 0 1 because rf algorithms are robust to outliers russell and norvig 2020 alpha can be calculated by dividing the attachment rate under electrostatically hindered is conditions by that under electrostatically favorable conditions surface modifications surface modifications of the collector are required for the favorable conditions but they imply other attachment mechanisms such as surface roughness choi et al 2015 which influence ideal favorable attachment and thus alpha values 1 can be calculated iii column has the biggest data size because most researchers run column experiments note that the literature reports case specific trends limited to particle types and experimental conditions we report trends across particle types and experimental conditions iv the number of missing data in cell and qcm d decreased resulting in higher r squared values for training and validation finally we present a varying degree of variable importance to each system type but explaining their importance requires case specific mechanisms that are beyond the scope of our study we provide fig 5 as a guide for researchers nom add contained none absence in solution collector coating and both in solution and collector coating averages of alpha according to nom add were in the order of both 0 11 coating 0 28 none 0 32 and in solution 0 37 interestingly averaged alpha was similar when nom add was none 0 32 and in solution 0 37 in the literature geitner et al 2017 jones and su 2012 alpha seems to be largely influenced by additives mixed in solution because these in solution can interact with other surfaces adsorbing onto them adsorbed layers can generate steric repulsion or bridging and they can be further compressed conformation changes at relatively high is increasing alpha to near that of bare surfaces bradford et al 2021 kim et al 2009 pham et al 2009 note that increasing is also decreases pt zeta leading to weaker electrostatic force and accordingly at some conditions reaching favorable interaction that makes alpha similar to none conditions when nom add is none pt zeta plays a role in the attachment conversely for both and coating averaged alphas considerably decreased this agreed with the widely known repulsive steric effects originating from additives philippe and schaumann 2014 turner et al 2020 additionally nom comprised 41 types table 1 and influenced alpha according to the type e g suwanee river fulvic acid tween 20 and srha and their concentration nom conc researchers have been interested in the role of organic matter surfactants or other surface modifying additives e g contaminants in particle deposition cornelis et al 2014 johnson et al 1996 philippe and schaumann 2014 fig 6 shows spearman s correlation coefficients at 0 1 significance level of the database imputed with missforest the coefficients were clustered hierarchically based on ward s minimum variance method which squared dissimilarities before clustering spearman s correlation showed the strength and direction of a monotonic not strictly linear correlation the top 5 variables system nom add nom pt zeta and nom conc had interactions with other variables and thus alpha was the result of these interactions the correlation between system type and nom addition type was positive but very weak as shown in fig 6 the correlation between nom addition type and nom type was positive and moderate as previously mentioned the nom addition type contained four individual initial experimental conditions none in solution coating and both we acknowledge that in solution under the nom addition type can generate surface coating influencing surface charge consequently higher repulsive conditions than those in only one side coating coating can occur nevertheless simultaneously occurring coating of both particle surface and collector surface due to in solution under the nom addition type are two mechanisms that cannot be easily decoupled and expressed in the database moreover there is a positive but weak correlation between the nom type and nom concentration as shown in fig 6 finally the correlation between nom addition type and particle charge was negative and weak because particle charge is also a function of electrophoretic mobility inverse debye length and particle hydrodynamic diameter e g reported zeta potential values are commonly calculated using smoluchowski s equation labib and williams 1984 sze et al 2003 system type did not correlate with particle charge because this is affected by water and surface chemistry interestingly there was no correlation between the nom type and particle charge but the opposite was expected the influence of the nom type might be reflected through other mechanisms such as steric repulsion or bridging moreover particle charge had a weak positive correlation with alpha literature reports that the dlvo theory predicts higher alpha as particle charge decreases becomes less negative because of reduced electrostatic repulsion bolster et al 2010 tufenkji and elimelech 2005 however according to the literature particle charge alone is insufficient to capture alpha s behavior as there is no direct correlation between them foppen et al 2010 li et al 2014 3 2 microplastic attachment experiments for validation qcm d experiments pt hdiam pt zeta coll zeta and pt ca measurements and pt h11 calculation were used to generate an additional validation dataset of 45 microplastic attachment records the validation dataset is provided in an excel file uploaded separately qcm d experiments were performed with carboxyl coated ps carboxyl coated pmma and tween 20 coated pe microplastics in the absence of srha in the presence of in solution srha and srha coated collector i e coated qcm d sensor in the presence of in solution srha notably various experimental conditions were totally new to the ml at this stage this was deliberately done to test its predictive abilities for example pmma pe and tween 20 coating were totally new data and a 0 5 ml min flow rate was very uncommon in qcm d experiments the si contains information regarding materials qcm d experiments other measurements and calculations fig 7 shows that training on the entire database increased r squared compared to split datasets in fig 4 nevertheless the validation was poor r squared of 0 23 0 06 because there were too few qcm d records in the training database for good learning and predictions out of 207 records 0 contained plastics under pt 0 contained carboxyl or tween 20 coatings under pt coating 4 contained in solution under nom add 10 contained both under nom add and 8 contained srha under nom however these variables are important in a qcm d system fig 5 and result in low predictive ability additionally the validation dataset was merged into the original database 2538 records to expand it 2583 records the expanded database was randomly split into training 70 and holdout 30 datasets the r squared values of both training and validation considerably increased fig 7 thus it is important to improve the database with complete records fewer missing data and microplastic data to enhance the predictive power of the additional experimental validation dataset 4 limitations and implications of the present study experimental alpha values in our database mined from the literature reflect the collective effect of many variables including the 22 studied and those that were neglected which will be briefly discussed in this section note that the contributions of the 22 variables to alpha values were explicitly acknowledged whereas those of other neglected variables remain implicit and depend on reported data there are distributions heterogeneity in size charge contact angle density etc that influence transport and retention for example nanoscale heterogeneities e g roughness parameters clay coating and charge heterogeneity were neglected in the current set of input variables yet influence the attachment variables characterizing surface nanoroughness on particles e g roughness fraction or root mean square average height could have been included bradford et al 2018 however surface roughness was unreported in the collected 74 articles some removal processes are also a function of the colloid concentration e g hydrodynamic bridging specific transport and retention mechanisms such as advection straining and blocking are also important but were neglected in the input bradford and bettahar 2005 homoaggregation heteroaggregation cation bridging polymer bridging and disaggregation were neglected han et al 2016 kim et al 2009 philippe and schaumann 2014 for example particle aggregation with clays organic matter or contaminants has been largely considered for modeling aquatic compartments de klein et al 2016 praetorius et al 2012 particle shape influences particle attachment by manipulating the dlvo energy barrier according to particle orientation gomez flores et al 2020 gomez flores et al 2019 similarly microplastic shape also affects their environmental transport koutnik et al 2021 the literature rarely reports or considers some of these other variables e g surface roughness charge heterogeneity and straining because they are difficult to quantify but alternatively some of them e g advection straining and blocking can be included as categorical variables in the input additionally our study is limited to saturated conditions that occur in groundwater and soils following ponded conditions however root and vadose attachment behaviors differ under unsaturated conditions due to air water interfaces cornelis 2015 keller et al 2020 some researchers may prefer mechanistic modeling over our empirical approach nevertheless empirical modeling has the advantage of handling multivariable and nonlinear processes over large amounts of data with relatively lower computational power instead of just one small specific dataset that researchers normally use we used a big dataset to prove the importance of 22 variables predict alpha and draw conclusions mechanistic modeling including semi empirical modeling and our ai based empirical modeling have different starting points these are first principles and experimental data respectively mechanistic modeling neglects variables for simplicity but neglecting variables that exist in real environment may be improper before systematic importance studies notably our database reflects the complexity of reality by using experimentally measured alpha values we envision that our database can be continuously expanded our modeling can readily provide alpha values predicted from experimental data without any experiments for practical applications using efm 5 conclusions it was found that missforest pre imputation followed by rfsrc was a successful method for handling missing data and making predictions literature poorly reported particle contact angle collector zeta potential particle hamaker constant particle zeta potential and particle hydrodynamic diameter producing missing data variable importance studies showed that system additive e g organic matter or surfactants addition additive type particle zeta potential and additive concentration were the top 5 important variables influencing alpha behavior variable correlation study indicated that alpha is influenced by multicorrelation and nonlinearity it was found that prediction ability increased as data increased hyperparameter optimization in the two rf algorithms or the use of other ml models neural networks genetic algorithms etc are options to further improve predictions alternatively mechanistic modeling might be used for predicting alpha over a wide range of experimental conditions and for comparison with our approach nevertheless input variables and complexity of mechanistic modeling limit its application in our database conversely our modeling better reflects reality because predicts based on experimental data which is useful for more realistic efm but requires more of this data mechanistic modeling makes simplifications neglecting variables that may be important it is impractical to include all variables in mechanistic modeling but machine learning modeling can handle many variables and find their importance our approach and results are not absolute but we propose an empirical data drive approach to make generalizations and predictions including case specific conditions supporting information a list of the peer reviewed articles mined for building the database

15209,high levels of alkali and alkaline earth metals aaem including k na ca and mg in sludge needs to be removed in pretreatment process for alleviating adverse effects on subsequent disposal theoretically the liquid environment provided by the pretreatment technology of thermal hydrolysis th is the ideal condition for the dissolution of aaem therefore this work quantified aaem removal efficiency of th and carbonaceous skeleton cskel assisted th that we previously proposed for sludge dewatering then the mechanism of aaem dissociating from sludge was explored through the new perspective of biological structure evolution and chemical species transformation the results showed that all of the aaem in raw sludge was trapped in extracellular polymer substances eps and cells only the water soluble k na in eps could be released by th to the supernatant the residual k na in eps was organically linked with humic matters that were generated through the degradation of proteins water nh4ac soluble k na in cells still stayed inside with a more stable form of hcl soluble after th fortunately with the assistance of cskel this part of k na could be leached out due to organic acids derived from hemicellulose decomposition in such a case the removal efficiency of k na was elevated to 55 5 and 72 5 respectively unlike k na nearly all the ca mg in eps were transferred to cell residuals during th they were combined with the bio phosphorus in cell residuals as the form of hcl soluble ca mg p precipitates rather than carbonates sulfates or other compounds this precipitation reaction was also moderately suppressed in cskel assisted th with low ph then 7 7 and 34 1 of ca mg were taken away by filtrate this means that appropriately raising the reaction temperature and adding cskel with high hemicellulose cellulose contents can promote the removal of aaem in sludge during th process graphcial abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewage sludge alkali and alkaline earth metals aaem thermal hydrolysis carbonaceous skeleton extracellular polymer substances eps data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction municipal sludge is an important by product generated from the sewage treatment process which contains high moisture content rich organic matters like extracellular polymer substances eps and multiple inorganic elements to realize sustainable sludge treatment pretreatments like conditioning and dewatering were usually applied for water removal followed by disposal methods including thermal conversion and anaerobic digestion for resource recovery in organic matters however the typical inorganic elements such as alkali and alkaline earth metals aaem including k na ca and mg whose content varied from 1 6 19 0 wt in total have generally become a concerning issue due to their negative impacts on sludge disposal cieslik and konieczka 2017 liu et al 2021 specifically for sludge thermal conversion technologies like incineration pyrolysis and gasification high contents of k na ca mg especially when exceeding the limit values of slagging and fouling indexes will cause severe slagging and fouling problems in the heat transfer facilities which directly threatens the safe operation of the disposal facilities zhao et al 2020 syed hassan et al 2017 reza et al 2013 seggiani et al 2012 for sludge anaerobic digestion the existence of ca mg especially the organic bunded ca mg will restrict the mobility of organic molecular and deteriorate the depolymerization of the biopolymers by bridging and hydrogen bonding interactions thus lowering the biogas conversion efficiency geng et al 2022 xu et al 2017a to alleviate these problems removing aaem from sludge at the start point is a promising solution the basic premise for achieving this goal is understanding the occurrence modes of aaem in sludge but little attention has been paid to this field according to the research on high alkali coal and biomass aaem mainly exists in water soluble forms such as k na salts and organic forms associated with nitrogen oxygen containing functional groups liu et al 2018a other chemical species were also found such as acid soluble form like carbonates and insoluble form which is bonded with clay minerals jordan and akay 2012 similarly it is supposed that all of these chemical binding forms should exist in sludge since aaem in sludge mainly came from k na ions in the human urine kundu et al 2022 c12h25so3na in the laundry effluent alemayehu et al 2020 ca mg carbonates and silicates in the dust brought by the rainwater zhang et al 2022 apart from the chemical species sludge is well known for its unique biological characteristics brought by the microorganisms and their derived eps seviour et al 2019 which may have a great influence on the spatial distribution of aaem for example as the essential elements for life dozens of k na existed within bacterias to adjust the osmotic pressure balance oren et al 1997 some ca mg were also combined with proteins on cell membranes as the enzyme activator klein et al 2004 ye et al 2016 other parts of ca mg were bonded with eps in the form of complexes which contribute to the cross linked structure of sludge flocs xu et al 2017a these studies revealed that plenty of aaems was trapped in sludge biological structures and cannot be removed freely with the filtrate discharge hence the dissociation of aaem should be preferentially satisfied by simultaneously breaking the chemical bindings of aaem and relieving the trapping effect of sludge flocs structure targeting at aaem with different chemical speciation several dealkalizaton methods have been proposed for handling high alkali coal and biomass by using various solutions like water organic solvents and acids however these methods were confronted with expensive reagent cost and severe time consumption and could not match the huge demand for sludge disposal tang et al 2022 thermal hydrolysis th a non evaporative and energy efficient conditioning method has been commonly used for sludge dewatering and anaerobic digestion generally th is carried out within a temperature range of 120 180 c although some studies have been performed in a broader range of 60 220 c barber 2016 kor bicakci et al 2019 kim et al 2022 recently the effect of th on aaem removal has been verified in coal and biomass hungwe et al 2021 proved that th could diminish nearly 100 of the water soluble ion exchangeable k in the coconut fibers at 200 c yang et al 2019 and zhao et al 2022 found that th at 300 c could destroy the coal matrix thus releasing the trapped aaem after which only 5 of na and 24 of ca remained in solids however aaem in sludge seemed more difficult to be removed than that in coal and biomass smith et al 2016 declared that 40 of k and 78 of na in sludge could not be eliminated even after th at 250 c wang et al 2019 also found that ca mg removal rates in sludge were less than 5 even when th conditions reached 300 c and 180 min these results showed that the aaem occurrence modes in sludge must vary widely with other high alkali materials but the existing literature mainly focused on aaem removal efficiency rather than their dissociation progress so the species transformation and the spatial migration of aaem in sludge during th pretreatment still remained to be explored in our previous studies the effects of th on sludge dewatering performance were investigated and an upgraded method named carbonaceous skeleton assisted thermal hydrolysis cskel th was proposed wang et al 2020 xiao et al 2022 in this method the carbonaceous skeleton cskel was added into sludge for co thermal hydrolysis cskel addition made a difference in the aqueous phase composition possibly promoting aaem leaching besides the water content of the pretreated sludge sharply decreased from 80 to 42 indicating more aaem may be taken away as the filtrate discharging owing to the aqueous environment changes and enhanced dewaterability derived by cskel addition the fate of aaem in cskel th may be different from that in th pretreatment thus this research aims to explore the removal efficiency of aaem during th and cskel th pretreatment then provided the corresponding mechanism by revealing the dissociation progress of aaem from sludge in detail the overall removal behaviors of aaem and their limiting step were quantified by exploring the total aaem distribution in cskel th products the aaem dissociation mechanism and essential causes for the immobilized part were further clarified by illuminating the aaem spatial migration and chemical species evolution path in sludge biological structures 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials there were three batches of raw sludge used in this study named sludge 1 sludge 2 and sludge 3 all the sludge entering the dewatering equipments is the excess secondary sludge mixed with a small amount of primary sludge since the raw materials of most commercial sludge th projects in china are pre dewatered sludge which is mainly collected from other wwtps ngo et al 2021 all the sludges used in this study were dewatered sludge sludge 1 was collected from wastewater treatment plant 1 wwtp 1 on march 6 2021 sludge 2 and sludge 3 were obtained from wastewater treatment plant 2 wwtp 2 on november 1 2019 and august 19 2020 separately the information about these wastewater treatment plants were listed in table s1 the collected sludge samples were placed in non transparent plastic buckets and stored at 4 c according to our previous study wang et al 2020 xiao et al 2022 the sawdust was selected as the typical cskel because it could realize the excellent sludge dewatering performance the sawdust was gained from a wood processing plant in tai an shandong province china the characteristics of the raw sludges and the cskel were tabulated in table 1 the hemicellulose cellulose and lignin contents of the sawdust were 22 04 51 72 and 22 62 separately elemental analysis for chon was carried out with an elementary analyzer elementar vario micro cube the sulfur content in the solid samples was measured by a sulfur analyzer elementar rapid s cube proximate analysis was tested by using a proximate analyzer eltra thermostep if not specifically mentioned the experimental results in each figure and table of this study were obtained from sludge 1 by default 2 2 sludge pretreatment procedures and the dewatering methods th and cskel th pretreatment were conducted in the device as depicted in fig s1 the reactor was made of 316 stainless steel with a volume of 300 ml the thermocouple was directly inserted into the samples to monitor the real time reaction temperature the raw sludge was diluted with deionized water to a solid liquid ratio of 1 14 to avoid the ineffective stirring of sludge and sawdust so that the mixed materials could always keep homogeneous czerwińska et al 2022 xu et al 2017b then 150 g of the mixture was put into the reactor for cskel th pretreatment 3 g dried cskel 0 3 g g ds was simultaneously added with the sludge a series of thermal hydrolysis experiments were performed at different temperatures 120 180 and 240 c under ar atmosphere with a holding time of 20 min the stirring speed was set at 200 rpm so that the samples could keep uniform all the time after pretreatment the reactor was taken out and cooled to room temperature by cold water the ph value of pretreated sludge was tested by the ph meter inesa phsj 3f 50 g of the pretreated sludge was collected for the floc structure extraction and the rest part was directly dewatered sludge dewatering was conducted in a self designed mechanical filtering system fig s2 the dewatering pressure was 1 mpa with a holding time of 20 min detailed operation instruction could be seen in the previous study xiao et al 2022 to investigate the effects of dewatering ratios on aaem removal sludge 2 was chosen for the centrifugal dewatering experiment the rotation speed was 2500 rpm and the holding time was 10 min the dewatering ratio dr could be calculated as d r m f i l t r a t e m t o t a l w a t e r 100 where mfiltrate is the mass of the filtrate of dewatered sludge and mtotal water is the mass of the total water in the reacted mixture the sludge cake and filtrates were collected for aaem determination 2 3 extraction of the sludge floc structure to investigate the spatial migration path of aaem during sludge pretreatment a thermal extraction method was carried out on 25 g pretreated sludge to obtain the different fractions of its floc structure including the supernatant slime s eps loosely bound eps lb eps tightly bound eps tb eps and the cell residuals li et al 2013 the detailed procedure was described in table s2 2 4 determination of total aaem content before the aaem content determination all the solid samples were freeze dried and ground into fine powders next 0 05 g of dried powder and 9 ml of mixed solutions consisting of hno3 7 ml hf 1 ml and h2o2 1ml were put into a microwave digestion tank ethos up milestone the mixture was gradually heated from room temperature to 190 c at the rate of 2 c min and held for 40 min all the liquid samples were passed through a 0 45 um membrane filter before testing the k na ca mg content in each sample was determined by the microwave plasma atomic emission spectrometer 4200mp aes agilent technologies the yields of cskel th products of sludge 1 were given in table s2 since the values about the partition of aaem were all presented as or g g the influence of product yields on aaem partition has been taken into consideration at the data processing stage 2 5 determination of different aaem species as illustrated in fig s3 a chemical extraction method was applied to uncover the chemical speciation of aaem in solid samples pettersson et al 2009 in brief 0 5 g dried solid sample was subjected to three successive extractions of deionized water 1 mol l ammonium acetate nh4ac and 1 mol l hcl the solid to liquid ratio was 1 100 in the first extraction water soluble compounds such as ions held by the water inside the solids or water soluble salts were obtained the nh4ac soluble aaem were those presented as exchangeable ions which organically bonded with carboxyl groups subsequent extraction using 1 mol l hcl solubilized coordinated k na ions which were organically bonded with nitrogen or oxygen containing functional groups liu et al 2018a as well as acid soluble ca mg like their carbonates sulphates and phosphates jordan and akay 2012 the aaem in the sediments after hcl extraction was generally considered to be aluminosilicates with high stability labeled as residuals since the eps layers were located in the suspensions and could not undergo species extraction directly a subtraction method was applied see text s1 all the experiments and tests were repeated three times to guarantee the validity of the results 2 6 other analytical methods 2 6 1 fluorescence spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis the three dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy f 4600 hitachi japan and the parallel factor eem parafac analysis had been used to track the changes of the typical organic components in eps more detailed information was listed in text s2 2 6 2 carbon and sulfur speciation

phosphorus speciation the speciation of phosphorus in the solids was determined by the standards measurements and testing smt programme of the european commission the phosphorus in the solids was divided into organic phosphorus op apatite inorganic phosphorus aip and non apatite inorganic phosphorus naip the aip referred to p associated with oxides and hydroxides of al fe and mn and the naip referred to p associated with ca and mg vardanyan et al 2018 the total content of phosphorus in the liquids was determined referring to the water and wastewater monitoring and analysis method fourth edition issued by the state environmental protection administration of china more detailed operation procedures could be seen in our previous study deng et al 2022 the distribution of ca mg and p elements on the cross section of the cell residuals was measured by an electron probe microanalyzer epma 8050g shimadzu japan 2 6 4 statistical analysis the linear fitting multiple regression and analysis of variance anova were all performed by ibm spss statistics 26 anova was performed on the key results of our study the detailed discussion and the modeling results could be seen in text s3 and table s4 s9 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of cskel th pretreatment on aaem removal in sludge 3 1 1 aaem removal behavior the aaem removal efficiency defined as the proportion of aaem taken away by the filtrate after the dewatering process of pretreated sludge was listed in table 2 sludge 1 was used as the experimental samples and the dewatering method was mechanical filtering the blank values of th are the aaem removal rates of the diluted raw sludge at room temperature while the blank values of cskel th are the aaem removal rates of the mixture of diluted raw sludge and the sawdust at room temperature the results showed that for th pretreated sludge k na were continuously carried out by the filtrate with the increase of the reaction temperature finally reaching their maximum removal efficiency of 52 5 and 69 4 at 240 c however the amount of ca mg taken away with the filtrate hit their peak values of 5 6 and 22 2 when the reaction temperature arrived at 180 c then showed a huge decline as the temperature further raised to 240 c it could be seen that k na kept being removed with the rising temperature while the removal rates of ca mg sharply decreased after the turning point of 180 c when using cskel during the th of sludge the above mentioned removal behaviors of k na and ca mg were also true but the maximum amount of k na ca and mg carried out by the filtrate were elevated to 55 5 72 5 9 3 and 44 6 separately table 2 additional th experiments were carried out on cskel and the results revealed that the increments of the removed aaem mainly came from the sludge itself rather than from the extra induced aaem in cskel for more detailed explanation please see text s3 this showed that whether for th or cskel th pretreatment the removal of k na was always much easier than that of ca mg to verify whether this phenomenon was valid for sludge with different compositions additional batches of sludges were used for aaem removal experiments fig s4 these sludge samples were specifically selected for a large range of organic matter contents sludge 1 53 5 sludge 2 44 5 sludge 3 33 9 see table 1 which was believed to represent sludge with different sources and different properties liang et al 2015 yu et al 2017 the results demonstrated that the effect of th and cskel th on k na removal was always higher than ca mg removal regardless of the changes of sludge properties to figure out the removal mechanisms of k na and ca mg the following section focused on finding the limiting process affecting aaem removal 3 1 2 analyzation of the limiting process affecting aaem removal in current dealkalization methods like water washing etc the aaems in the high alkali materials were leached out into different solvents firstly and the liquid phase was then separated to achieve aaem removal ratnasari et al 2019 lee et al 2022 similar to that progress the aaem removal of sludge could also be divided into two steps the dissociation process and the dewatering process fig 1 that was to say k na and ca mg needed to release from the solids to the liquids firstly during cskel th pretreatment and were then removed along with the filtrate in the following dewatering process the removal behaviors of k na and ca mg in cskel th pretreated sludge must be in connection with both of the dissociation process and the dewatering process to find out which process was the limiting step the contributions of the dissociation process and the dewatering processes to aaem removal were calculated and the results were listed in table 3 for th pretreated sludge the dewatering contributions on k na and ca mg removal were the same always ranging from 17 to 44 at 120 240 c the dissociation contributions on k na removal kept rising with the elevated temperature for example the values of k raised from 35 6 at 120 c to 106 5 at 240 c the dissociation contribution on ca mg removal was strengthened with increasing temperature reaching 38 1 and 106 1 at 180 c separately however a huge decline appeared when the reaction temperature further elevated to 240 c and the dissociation contributions on ca mg removal became 64 4 and 45 6 respectively the similar situation also occurred in cskel th pretreated sludge but its dissociation contributions on k na and ca mg removal were obviously higher than th pretreated sludge the above results showed that the different removal behaviors between k na and ca mg were mainly attributed to their difference in the dissociation process not in the dewatering process this phenomenon could also be observed when analyzing the correlations between the dewatering performance and the aaem removal behaviors fig 2 the origin coordinate 0 0 in fig 2 referred to the blank groups the horizontal and vertical coordinates were the dewatering ratio increments and aaem removal rate increments of conditioned sludges compared with the blank groups in this way if the data points were exactly distributed in the 1 1 proportional growth line the aaem removal rate increment was only decided by the dewatering process if the data points diverged from the 1 1 growth line the dissociation process was proved to have an impact on aaem removal in th pretreatment the data points of k na and ca mg at 180 and 240 c were all located in the first quadrant showing that the sludge dewaterability was enhanced with the rising temperature and contributed to aaem removal interestingly the data points of k na at 180 and 240 c were all above the 1 1 growth line and kept floating upward as the temperature increased fig 2 a and b on the contrary the data points of ca mg were all below the 1 1 growth line in the first quadrant and began to sink downward when the temperature exceeded 180 c fig 2 c and d the same laws were also found in cskel th pretreatment therefore the dissociation process was proved to have a more considerable contribution to the different removal behaviors between k na and ca mg to confirm the predominance of the dissociation process on aaem removal sludge 2 was treated at the same temperatures but then dewatered by mechanical pressing and centrifugation for aaem removal separately because of the different dewatering ratios caused by the two dewatering methods this experimental design could explore the effects of the dewatering process on aaem removal under the same dissociation contribution as shown in fig s5 although the dewatering ratios of mechanically dewatered sludge were visibly much higher than that of centrifugal dewatered sludge the k na and ca mg removal rates of sludge obtained by the two dewatering methods after th pretreatment were generally the same only after cskel th pretreatment the k na and ca mg removal rate of mechanically dewatered sludge was significantly higher than that of the centrifugal dewatered sludge this further supported that the dissociation process was the limiting step affecting aaem removal considering the huge difference in the dissociation rules of k na and ca mg their dissociation mechanism would be discussed separately 3 2 mechanism of k na dissociation 3 2 1 spatial migration of k na in sludge organic floc structures essentially the dissociation process was a spatial transfer process during which the aaem continuously diffused from the inside to the outside of sludge in order to describe this spatial migration path of aaem in the dissociation process the sludge floc structure was divided into five layers from internal to external cell residuals tb eps lb eps s eps and supernatant and the aaem content changes in each layer were measured the aaem in the supernatant was considered to be removed freely while the aaem in each eps layer and the cell residuals were all regarded to be trapped d abzac et al 2010 in view of the increasing binding strength of different eps with the cells the stability of aaem in these layers of raw sludge could be ranked as cell residuals tb eps lb eps s eps li et al 2013 in cskel th pretreatment these trapped aaem needed to migrate from the inner layers to the supernatant after which they can be removed in the following dewatering process the spatial migration of k na were illustrated in fig 3 in the untreated raw sludge the blank groups k na could only be detected in cell residuals and eps layers instead of the supernatant indicating that all the k na in raw sludge were tightly bunded with the eps and cells th pretreatment could liberate the trapped k na in the eps layers so that the k na ratios in the supernatant finally achieved 22 1 and 29 9 at 240 c fig 3 a and b the k na in the cell residuals seemed difficult to be set free by th pretreatment which always maintained around 51 and 42 however as for cskel th pretreated sludge these values declined to 40 4 and 32 2 at 240 c fig 3 c and d this indicated that cskel th facilitated k na releasing mainly from the cell residuals to the eps layers and the supernatant 3 2 2 k na species evolution in the cell residuals of conditioned sludge the sequential extraction experiment was carried out on the cell residuals of conditioned sludge to clarify the mechanism of the enhanced k na releasing effect fig 4 the water soluble and nh4ac soluble k na in the cell residuals of th pretreated sludge kept reducing from 120 to 240 c and were transformed into hcl soluble form fig 4 a and b the hcl soluble k na was closely linked with organic substances like nitrogen or oxygen containing functional groups liu et al 2018a they have a relatively stable chemical structure and could be released only when experiencing acid extraction or high temperature combustion liu et al 2018b fortunately with the assistance of cskel organics acids such as acetic formic and levulinic acid were generated through the decomposition of hemicellulose cellulose and their degradation compounds like furfural derivatives during th process sharma et al 2020 reza et al 2013 under that circumstance the minimum ph value of cskel th pretreated sludge reached 5 4 while this value for th pretreated sludge was only 6 2 fig 5 as a result the formation of hcl soluble k na was inhibited and most of the water soluble and nh4ac soluble k na were removed from the cell residuals after cskel th pretreatment fig 4 c and d what s more it was worth noting that in fig 4 c and d although there was 11 and 9 5 additional k na released from the cell residuals of cskel th pretreated sludges k na proportion in the supernatant only increased by up to 5 0 and 2 3 this result revealed that although cskel th could liberate the trapped k na in the cell residuals more than half of these released k na were re captured by the eps layers 3 2 3 k na species evolution in the eps layers of conditioned sludge the k na species evolution in the eps layers was further investigated to explore the re capture mechanism fig 6 the results showed that compared with the blank conditioning group the re captured k na in eps after cskel th pretreatment were mainly in the forms of water soluble and nh4ac soluble nevertheless the re captured water soluble k na would escape from the eps layers with the rising temperature while the proportions of nh4ac soluble k na were even 18 2 and 18 6 higher than that in the eps of the blank conditioning group fig 6 c and d the nh4ac soluble k na was considered as ion exchangeable which organically bounded with the functional structures like carboxyl groups miller r n 1977 consequently the various organic components in eps were considered to be highly related to the re capture effect of k na 3 2 4 correlation between typical components in eps and trapped k na since the s eps was the outermost eps layer and also had the most obvious re capture effect on k na releasing fig 3 a d it was chosen for characterizing the typical organic matters by eem parafac a three component parafac model was validated using the eem samples of the s eps derived from th pretreated sludge cskel th pretreated sludge and th pretreated cskel fig 7 in this study the fluorescent component 1 c1 displayed two peaks at the excitation emission wavelengths ex em of 275 nm 345 nm and 220 nm 345nm the fluorescent component 2 c2 exhibited a primary peak at 320 nm 400 nm ex em and a secondary peak at 235 395 nm ex em the fluorescent component 3 c3 had a dominant peak at 365 nm 430 nm ex em based on the previous literature the identified c1 could be assigned to protein like substances wells et al 2022 and the c2 and c3 were both classified as humic like substances zhu et al 2021 fellman et al 2009 in addition the humic like substance demonstrating its peak at higher em was considered to have a larger molecule weight lee et al 2015 thus the c2 and c3 were distinguished by the different molecule weights in the order of c2 c3 the correlation between the contents of k na and the typical organics in s eps of cskel th pretreated sludges by multiple regression analysis were given in fig 8 the results showed that c2 and c3 were the most significant factors affecting k na re capture c2 kept increasing with the rising temperature and showed a strong promoting effect on k na re capture whose coefficients were 4 46 for k r2 0 823 and 4 64 for na r2 0 630 this explained the uptrend of the nh4ac soluble k na in the eps of cskel th pretreated sludge because c2 was known as a distinctive metal ions adsorbent in agricultural studies due to its high abundance of oxygen containing groups like phenolic hydroxyl and methoxyl zhao and naeth 2022 zoerb et al 2014 besides c3 showed an inhibition effect on k na re capture whose coefficients were 3 72 for k r2 0 823 and 4 00 for na r2 0 630 fig 8 c this was because c3 humic like substance with high molecule weight was produced by the polymerization of c2 humic like substance with small molecule weight in thermal hydrolysis in this process the dehydration and decarboxylation reactions brought about the elimination of the oxygen containing functional groups so that the binding effect of eps on k na was weakened 3 3 mechanism of ca mg re immobilization 3 3 1 spatial migration of ca mg in sludge organic floc structures different from k na a significant re immobilization phenomenon was observed for ca mg releasing after the turning point of 180 c fig 2 c d and table 3 to find the reasons the spatial migration path of ca mg in sludge floc structures were illustrated in fig 9 during th pretreatment none of the ca mg was detected in the supernatant of the blank groups which meant that all the ca mg in raw sludge were tightly bunded with the eps and cells the ratios of trapped ca mg in eps layers diminished by 13 3 and 20 8 in total at 240 c when compared to the blank group but their ratios in the supernatant only increased by 0 9 and 2 8 fig 9 a and b the majority of released ca mg in eps was transferred into the cell residuals whose proportions reached 97 1 and 92 0 at 240 c the above rules were also suitable for the ca mg after cskel pretreatment but the ca mg proportions in the cell residuals were much lower whose values were only 91 4 and 82 1 at 240 c fig 9 c and d these results suggested that the re immobilized ca mg were mainly located in the cell residuals of sludge and cskel th could inhibit ca mg migration from eps to the cell residuals 3 3 2 ca mg species evolution in the cell residuals of conditioned sludge the sequential extraction experiment of different ca mg species showed that the hcl soluble form was the predominant species in the cell residuals of th pretreated sludge whose proportion rose from 46 3 and 31 1 the blank group to 80 5 and 69 1 at 240 c fig 10 a and b since the hcl extracted ca mg was believed to be acid soluble sediments such as their carbonates phosphates and sulphates jordan and akay 2012 the re immobilization of released ca mg cations turned out to be a precipitation reaction during th pretreatment of sludge the acid compounds were produced like volatile fatty acids which derived from polysaccharides decomposition together with the production of alkaline compounds like amine functional groups which originated from the breakdown of proteins wang and li 2015 under the combined influence of these substances the ph value of th pretreated sludge was always roughly maintained at 7 which was conducive to the formation of ca mg precipitates fig 6 the addition of cskel lowered the ph to a minimum value of 5 4 by that means the balance of ca mg precipitation reaction moved towards the dissolution direction and the maximum ratios of hcl soluble ca mg decreased to 67 0 and 58 4 at 240 c fig 10 c and d at present it could be preliminarily determined that the re immobilized ca mg in the cell residuals was attributed to the precipitation of the released ca mg cations from the eps layers but the binding form of these hcl soluble precipitates still remained unclear 3 3 3 binding forms of hcl soluble ca mg in the cell residuals of conditioned sludge according to the study of lu et al 2022 the ions produced in thermal hydrolysis process which could form hcl soluble precipitates with ca mg cations mainly included carbonate sulfate and phosphate based on this the carbonates and sulfates content changes in the cell residuals of conditioned sludge were measured by xps to find out their potential relationship with ca mg re immobilization more detailed results for xps peak fittings can be seen in fig s6 whether in th or cskel th pretreatment the content of metal carbonate and metal sulfate generally showed a downward trend from 120 c to 240 c table 4 which was opposite to the growing trend of hcl soluble ca mg in the cell residuals the linear regression results in table 4 also showed that both carbonates and sulfates exhibited weak relations with hcl soluble ca mg changes r2 0 6022 for carbonates and r2 0 0287 for sulfates therefore the hcl soluble precipitates of ca mg were proved not to exist mainly in the form of carbonates or sulfates the different p species in the cell residuals of conditioned sludge were thus characterized and the results showed that only the content of aip inorganic phosphorus dominated by ca mg p always kept growing with the increasing temperatures whether in th and cskel th pretreated sludge fig 11 a the correlation analysis in fig 11 b showed that the increase of re immobilized hcl soluble ca mg has a strong and extremely significant relationship with the changes of aip r2 0 9703 and p value 0 005 since this accurate fitting result was derived from the values of two different reaction systems both th and cskel th pretreated sludge and all the data points were located within the 95 confidence interval it was reasonable to conclude that the ca mg p was the predominant species of the hcl soluble ca mg precipitates what s more the cell residuals of raw sludge and cskel th pretreated sludge at 240 c were selected for the epma testing and the distribution of ca mg and p elements in the cell residuals was visually illustrated in fig 12 a it could be observed that the initial ca mg in the microbial cells was not always accompanied by p for example ca in the position of 1 2 as well as mg in the position of 1 2 3 showed inconsistent distribution behaviors with p at the corresponding places nevertheless after cskel th pretreatment the distribution of ca mg and p tended to be uniform and consistent which further supported the conclusion that ca mg re immobilization was due to the formation of phosphate precipitates according to fig 12 b c the eps layers only contained 4 of total p in raw sludge so the increase of aip mainly came from the decomposition of organic p in the cell residuals thereby the ca mg re immobilization mechanism was concluded as follows th led to the simultaneous release of ca mg cations in the eps and the bio phosphorus in microbial cells who combined with each other to form ca mg p precipitates and finally transferred into the cell residuals 4 conclusion this work explored the removal behaviors of aaem in sludge during both th and cskel th pretreatments then further illuminated the dissociation mechanism by revealing the aaem spatial migration and chemical species evolution in sludge biological structures the results show that the reaction temperature and cskel addition were two dominant roles in aaem removal high temperature 240 c could effectively dissociate water soluble k na in eps but the rest k na in eps was absorbed by the humic matters as nh4ac soluble form the water nh4ac soluble k na in cells was also converted to hcl soluble form with stronger stability and left in cell residuals meanwhile ca mg in eps and the bio phosphorus in microbial cells were released simultaneously when the temperature exceeded 180 c they combined with each other to form hcl soluble ca mg p precipitate so that over 90 of ca mg was left in cell residuals instead of being removed as for cskel addition the hemicellulose cellulose in sawdust was degraded to produce organic acids which reduce the ph values of cskel th pretreated sludge from 7 5 to 5 4 the weak acidic environment effectively hindered the formation of hcl soluble k na and ca mg p precipitate in the cell residuals as a result the removal rates of k na ca mg in cskel th pretreated sludge were raised to 55 5 72 5 9 3 and 44 6 separately the above conclusions indicated that appropriately raising the th temperature and using cskel with high hemicellulose cellulose content are suitable pretreatment methods for avoiding aaem induced problems in sludge

15209,high levels of alkali and alkaline earth metals aaem including k na ca and mg in sludge needs to be removed in pretreatment process for alleviating adverse effects on subsequent disposal theoretically the liquid environment provided by the pretreatment technology of thermal hydrolysis th is the ideal condition for the dissolution of aaem therefore this work quantified aaem removal efficiency of th and carbonaceous skeleton cskel assisted th that we previously proposed for sludge dewatering then the mechanism of aaem dissociating from sludge was explored through the new perspective of biological structure evolution and chemical species transformation the results showed that all of the aaem in raw sludge was trapped in extracellular polymer substances eps and cells only the water soluble k na in eps could be released by th to the supernatant the residual k na in eps was organically linked with humic matters that were generated through the degradation of proteins water nh4ac soluble k na in cells still stayed inside with a more stable form of hcl soluble after th fortunately with the assistance of cskel this part of k na could be leached out due to organic acids derived from hemicellulose decomposition in such a case the removal efficiency of k na was elevated to 55 5 and 72 5 respectively unlike k na nearly all the ca mg in eps were transferred to cell residuals during th they were combined with the bio phosphorus in cell residuals as the form of hcl soluble ca mg p precipitates rather than carbonates sulfates or other compounds this precipitation reaction was also moderately suppressed in cskel assisted th with low ph then 7 7 and 34 1 of ca mg were taken away by filtrate this means that appropriately raising the reaction temperature and adding cskel with high hemicellulose cellulose contents can promote the removal of aaem in sludge during th process graphcial abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewage sludge alkali and alkaline earth metals aaem thermal hydrolysis carbonaceous skeleton extracellular polymer substances eps data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction municipal sludge is an important by product generated from the sewage treatment process which contains high moisture content rich organic matters like extracellular polymer substances eps and multiple inorganic elements to realize sustainable sludge treatment pretreatments like conditioning and dewatering were usually applied for water removal followed by disposal methods including thermal conversion and anaerobic digestion for resource recovery in organic matters however the typical inorganic elements such as alkali and alkaline earth metals aaem including k na ca and mg whose content varied from 1 6 19 0 wt in total have generally become a concerning issue due to their negative impacts on sludge disposal cieslik and konieczka 2017 liu et al 2021 specifically for sludge thermal conversion technologies like incineration pyrolysis and gasification high contents of k na ca mg especially when exceeding the limit values of slagging and fouling indexes will cause severe slagging and fouling problems in the heat transfer facilities which directly threatens the safe operation of the disposal facilities zhao et al 2020 syed hassan et al 2017 reza et al 2013 seggiani et al 2012 for sludge anaerobic digestion the existence of ca mg especially the organic bunded ca mg will restrict the mobility of organic molecular and deteriorate the depolymerization of the biopolymers by bridging and hydrogen bonding interactions thus lowering the biogas conversion efficiency geng et al 2022 xu et al 2017a to alleviate these problems removing aaem from sludge at the start point is a promising solution the basic premise for achieving this goal is understanding the occurrence modes of aaem in sludge but little attention has been paid to this field according to the research on high alkali coal and biomass aaem mainly exists in water soluble forms such as k na salts and organic forms associated with nitrogen oxygen containing functional groups liu et al 2018a other chemical species were also found such as acid soluble form like carbonates and insoluble form which is bonded with clay minerals jordan and akay 2012 similarly it is supposed that all of these chemical binding forms should exist in sludge since aaem in sludge mainly came from k na ions in the human urine kundu et al 2022 c12h25so3na in the laundry effluent alemayehu et al 2020 ca mg carbonates and silicates in the dust brought by the rainwater zhang et al 2022 apart from the chemical species sludge is well known for its unique biological characteristics brought by the microorganisms and their derived eps seviour et al 2019 which may have a great influence on the spatial distribution of aaem for example as the essential elements for life dozens of k na existed within bacterias to adjust the osmotic pressure balance oren et al 1997 some ca mg were also combined with proteins on cell membranes as the enzyme activator klein et al 2004 ye et al 2016 other parts of ca mg were bonded with eps in the form of complexes which contribute to the cross linked structure of sludge flocs xu et al 2017a these studies revealed that plenty of aaems was trapped in sludge biological structures and cannot be removed freely with the filtrate discharge hence the dissociation of aaem should be preferentially satisfied by simultaneously breaking the chemical bindings of aaem and relieving the trapping effect of sludge flocs structure targeting at aaem with different chemical speciation several dealkalizaton methods have been proposed for handling high alkali coal and biomass by using various solutions like water organic solvents and acids however these methods were confronted with expensive reagent cost and severe time consumption and could not match the huge demand for sludge disposal tang et al 2022 thermal hydrolysis th a non evaporative and energy efficient conditioning method has been commonly used for sludge dewatering and anaerobic digestion generally th is carried out within a temperature range of 120 180 c although some studies have been performed in a broader range of 60 220 c barber 2016 kor bicakci et al 2019 kim et al 2022 recently the effect of th on aaem removal has been verified in coal and biomass hungwe et al 2021 proved that th could diminish nearly 100 of the water soluble ion exchangeable k in the coconut fibers at 200 c yang et al 2019 and zhao et al 2022 found that th at 300 c could destroy the coal matrix thus releasing the trapped aaem after which only 5 of na and 24 of ca remained in solids however aaem in sludge seemed more difficult to be removed than that in coal and biomass smith et al 2016 declared that 40 of k and 78 of na in sludge could not be eliminated even after th at 250 c wang et al 2019 also found that ca mg removal rates in sludge were less than 5 even when th conditions reached 300 c and 180 min these results showed that the aaem occurrence modes in sludge must vary widely with other high alkali materials but the existing literature mainly focused on aaem removal efficiency rather than their dissociation progress so the species transformation and the spatial migration of aaem in sludge during th pretreatment still remained to be explored in our previous studies the effects of th on sludge dewatering performance were investigated and an upgraded method named carbonaceous skeleton assisted thermal hydrolysis cskel th was proposed wang et al 2020 xiao et al 2022 in this method the carbonaceous skeleton cskel was added into sludge for co thermal hydrolysis cskel addition made a difference in the aqueous phase composition possibly promoting aaem leaching besides the water content of the pretreated sludge sharply decreased from 80 to 42 indicating more aaem may be taken away as the filtrate discharging owing to the aqueous environment changes and enhanced dewaterability derived by cskel addition the fate of aaem in cskel th may be different from that in th pretreatment thus this research aims to explore the removal efficiency of aaem during th and cskel th pretreatment then provided the corresponding mechanism by revealing the dissociation progress of aaem from sludge in detail the overall removal behaviors of aaem and their limiting step were quantified by exploring the total aaem distribution in cskel th products the aaem dissociation mechanism and essential causes for the immobilized part were further clarified by illuminating the aaem spatial migration and chemical species evolution path in sludge biological structures 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials there were three batches of raw sludge used in this study named sludge 1 sludge 2 and sludge 3 all the sludge entering the dewatering equipments is the excess secondary sludge mixed with a small amount of primary sludge since the raw materials of most commercial sludge th projects in china are pre dewatered sludge which is mainly collected from other wwtps ngo et al 2021 all the sludges used in this study were dewatered sludge

separately the information about these wastewater treatment plants were listed in table s1 the collected sludge samples were placed in non transparent plastic buckets and stored at 4 c according to our previous study wang et al 2020 xiao et al 2022 the sawdust was selected as the typical cskel because it could realize the excellent sludge dewatering performance the sawdust was gained from a wood processing plant in tai an shandong province china the characteristics of the raw sludges and the cskel were tabulated in table 1 the hemicellulose cellulose and lignin contents of the sawdust were 22

study were obtained from sludge 1 by default 2 2 sludge pretreatment procedures and the dewatering methods th and cskel th pretreatment were conducted in the device as depicted in fig s1 the reactor was made of 316 stainless steel with a volume of 300 ml the thermocouple was directly inserted into the samples to monitor the real time reaction temperature the raw sludge was diluted with deionized water to a solid liquid ratio of 1 14 to avoid the ineffective stirring of sludge and sawdust so that the mixed materials could always keep homogeneous czerwińska et al 2022 xu et al 2017b then 150 g of the mixture was put into the reactor for cskel th pretreatment 3 g dried cskel 0 3 g g ds was simultaneously added with the sludge a series of thermal hydrolysis experiments were performed at different temperatures 120 180 and 240 c under ar atmosphere with a holding time of 20 min the stirring speed was set at 200 rpm so that the samples could keep uniform all the time after pretreatment the reactor was taken out and cooled to room temperature by cold water the ph value of pretreated sludge was tested by the ph meter inesa phsj 3f 50 g of the pretreated sludge was collected for the floc structure extraction and the rest part was directly dewatered sludge dewatering was conducted in a self designed mechanical filtering system fig s2 the dewatering pressure was 1 mpa with a holding time of 20 min detailed operation instruction could be seen in the previous study xiao et al 2022 to investigate the effects of dewatering ratios on aaem removal sludge 2 was chosen for the centrifugal dewatering experiment the rotation speed was 2500 rpm and the holding time was 10 min the dewatering ratio dr could be calculated as d r m f i l t r a t e m t o t a l w a t e r 100 where mfiltrate is the mass of the filtrate of dewatered sludge and mtotal water is the mass of the total water in the reacted mixture the sludge cake and filtrates were collected for aaem determination 2 3 extraction of the sludge floc structure to investigate the spatial migration path of aaem during sludge pretreatment a thermal extraction method was carried out on 25 g pretreated sludge to obtain the different fractions of its floc structure including the supernatant slime s eps loosely bound eps lb eps tightly bound eps tb eps and the cell residuals li et al 2013 the detailed procedure was described in table s2 2 4 determination of total aaem content before the aaem content determination all the solid samples were freeze dried and ground into fine powders next 0 05 g of dried powder and 9 ml of mixed solutions consisting of hno3 7 ml hf 1 ml and h2o2 1ml were put into a microwave digestion tank ethos up milestone the mixture was gradually heated from room temperature to 190 c at the rate of 2 c min and held for 40 min all the liquid samples were passed through a 0 45 um membrane filter before testing the k na ca mg content in each sample was determined by the microwave plasma atomic emission spectrometer 4200mp aes agilent technologies the yields of cskel th products of sludge 1 were given in table s2 since the values about the partition of aaem were all presented as or g g the influence of product yields on aaem partition has been taken into consideration at the data processing stage 2 5 determination of different aaem species as illustrated in fig s3 a chemical extraction method was applied to uncover the chemical speciation of aaem in solid samples pettersson et al 2009 in brief 0 5 g dried solid sample was subjected to three successive extractions of deionized water 1 mol l ammonium acetate nh4ac and 1 mol l hcl the solid to liquid ratio was 1 100 in the first extraction water soluble compounds such as ions held by the water inside the solids or water soluble salts were obtained the nh4ac soluble aaem were those presented as exchangeable ions which organically bonded with carboxyl groups subsequent extraction using 1 mol l hcl solubilized coordinated k na ions which were organically bonded with nitrogen or oxygen containing functional groups liu et al 2018a as well as acid soluble ca mg like their carbonates sulphates and phosphates jordan and akay 2012 the aaem in the sediments after hcl extraction was generally considered to be aluminosilicates with high stability labeled as residuals since the eps layers were located in the suspensions and could not undergo species extraction directly a subtraction method was applied see text s1 all the experiments and tests were repeated three times to guarantee the validity of the results 2 6 other analytical methods 2 6 1 fluorescence spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis the three dimensional excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy f 4600 hitachi japan and

analysis of variance anova were all performed by ibm spss statistics 26 anova was performed on the key results of our study the detailed discussion and the modeling results could be seen in text s3 and table s4 s9 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of cskel th pretreatment on aaem removal in sludge 3 1 1 aaem removal behavior the aaem removal efficiency defined as the proportion of aaem taken away by the filtrate after the dewatering process of pretreated sludge was listed in table 2 sludge 1 was used as the experimental samples and the dewatering method was mechanical filtering the blank values of th are the aaem removal rates of the diluted raw sludge at room temperature while the blank values of cskel th are the aaem removal rates of the mixture of diluted raw sludge and the sawdust at room temperature the results showed that for th pretreated sludge k na were continuously carried out by the filtrate with the increase of the reaction temperature finally reaching their maximum removal efficiency of 52 5 and 69 4 at 240 c however the amount of ca mg taken away with the filtrate hit their peak values of 5 6 and 22 2 when the reaction temperature arrived at 180 c then showed a huge decline as the temperature further raised to 240 c it could be seen that k na kept being removed with the rising temperature while the removal rates of ca mg sharply decreased after the turning point of 180 c when using cskel during the th of sludge the above mentioned removal behaviors of k na and ca mg were also true but the maximum amount of k na ca and mg carried out by the filtrate were elevated to 55 5 72 5 9 3 and 44 6 separately table 2 additional th experiments were carried out on cskel and the results revealed that the increments of the removed aaem mainly came from the sludge itself rather than from the extra induced aaem in cskel for more detailed explanation please see text s3 this showed that whether for th or cskel th pretreatment the removal of k na was always much easier than that of ca mg to verify whether this phenomenon was valid for sludge with different compositions additional batches of sludges were used for aaem removal experiments fig s4 these sludge samples were specifically selected for a large range of organic matter contents sludge 1 53 5 sludge 2 44 5 sludge 3 33 9 see table 1 which was believed to represent sludge with different sources and different properties liang et al 2015 yu et al 2017 the results demonstrated that the effect of th and cskel th on k na removal was always higher than ca mg removal regardless of the changes of sludge properties to figure out the removal mechanisms of k na and ca mg the following section focused on finding the limiting process affecting aaem removal 3 1 2 analyzation of the limiting process affecting aaem removal in current dealkalization methods like water washing etc the aaems in the high alkali materials were leached out into different solvents firstly and the liquid phase was then separated to achieve aaem removal ratnasari et al 2019 lee et al 2022 similar to that progress the aaem removal of sludge could also be divided into two steps the dissociation process and the dewatering process fig 1 that was to say k na and ca mg needed to release from the solids to the liquids firstly during cskel th pretreatment and were then removed along with the filtrate in the following dewatering process the removal behaviors of k na and ca mg in cskel th pretreated sludge must be in connection with both of the dissociation process and the dewatering process to find out which process was the limiting step the contributions of the dissociation process and the dewatering processes to aaem removal were calculated and the results were listed in table 3 for th pretreated sludge the dewatering contributions on k na and ca mg removal were the same always ranging from 17 to 44 at 120 240 c the dissociation contributions on k na removal kept rising with the elevated temperature for example the values of k raised from 35 6 at 120 c to 106 5 at 240 c the dissociation contribution on ca mg removal was strengthened with increasing temperature reaching 38 1 and 106 1 at 180 c separately however a huge decline appeared when the reaction temperature further elevated to 240 c and the dissociation contributions on ca mg removal became 64 4 and 45 6 respectively the similar situation also occurred in cskel th pretreated sludge but its dissociation contributions on k na and ca mg removal were obviously higher than th pretreated sludge the above results showed that the different removal behaviors between k na and ca mg were mainly attributed to their difference in the dissociation process not in the dewatering process this phenomenon could also be observed when analyzing the correlations between the dewatering performance and the aaem removal behaviors fig 2 the origin coordinate 0 0 in fig 2 referred to the blank groups the horizontal and vertical coordinates were the dewatering ratio increments and aaem removal rate increments of conditioned sludges compared with the blank groups in this way if the data points were exactly distributed in the 1 1 proportional growth line the aaem removal rate increment was only decided by the dewatering process if the data points diverged from the 1 1 growth line the dissociation process was proved to have an impact on aaem removal in th pretreatment the data points of k na and ca mg at 180 and 240 c were all located in the first quadrant showing that the sludge dewaterability was enhanced with the rising temperature and contributed to aaem removal interestingly the data points of k na at 180 and 240 c were all above the 1 1 growth line and kept floating upward as the temperature increased fig 2 a and b on the contrary the data points of ca mg were all below the 1 1 growth line in the first quadrant and began to sink downward when the temperature exceeded 180 c fig 2 c and d the same laws were also found in cskel th pretreatment therefore the dissociation process was proved to have a more considerable contribution to the different removal behaviors between k na and ca mg to confirm the predominance of the dissociation process on aaem removal sludge 2 was treated at the same temperatures but then dewatered by mechanical pressing and centrifugation for aaem removal separately because of the different dewatering ratios caused by the two dewatering methods this experimental design could explore the effects of the dewatering process on aaem removal under the same dissociation contribution as shown in fig s5 although the dewatering ratios of mechanically dewatered sludge were visibly much higher than that of centrifugal dewatered sludge the k na and ca mg removal rates of sludge obtained by the two dewatering methods after th pretreatment were generally the same only after cskel th pretreatment the k na and ca mg removal rate of mechanically dewatered sludge was significantly higher than that of the centrifugal dewatered sludge this further supported that the dissociation process was the limiting step affecting aaem removal considering the huge difference in the dissociation rules of k na and ca mg their dissociation mechanism would be discussed separately 3 2 mechanism of k na dissociation 3 2 1 spatial migration of k na in sludge organic floc structures essentially the dissociation process was a spatial transfer process during which the aaem continuously diffused from the inside to the outside of sludge in order to describe this spatial migration path of aaem in the dissociation process the sludge floc structure was divided into five layers from internal to external cell residuals tb eps lb eps s eps and supernatant and the aaem content changes in each layer were measured the aaem in the supernatant was considered to be removed freely while the aaem in each eps layer and the cell residuals were all regarded to be trapped d abzac et al 2010 in view of the increasing binding strength of different eps with the cells the stability of aaem in these layers of raw sludge could be ranked as cell residuals tb eps lb eps s eps li et al 2013 in cskel th pretreatment these trapped aaem needed to migrate from the inner layers to the supernatant after which they can be removed in the following dewatering process the spatial migration of k na were illustrated in fig 3 in the untreated raw sludge the blank groups k na could only be detected in cell residuals and eps layers instead of the supernatant indicating that all the k na in raw sludge were tightly bunded with the eps and cells th pretreatment could liberate the trapped k na in the eps layers so that the k na ratios in the supernatant finally achieved 22 1 and 29 9 at 240 c fig 3 a and b the k na in the cell residuals seemed difficult to be set free by th pretreatment which always maintained around 51 and 42 however as for cskel th pretreated sludge these values declined to 40 4 and 32 2 at 240 c fig 3 c and d this indicated that cskel th facilitated k na releasing mainly from the cell residuals to the eps layers and the supernatant 3 2 2 k na species evolution in the cell residuals of conditioned sludge the sequential extraction experiment was carried out on the cell residuals of conditioned sludge to clarify the mechanism of the enhanced k na releasing effect fig 4 the water soluble and nh4ac soluble k na in the cell residuals of th pretreated sludge kept reducing from 120 to 240 c and were transformed into hcl soluble form fig 4 a and b the hcl soluble k na was closely linked with organic substances like nitrogen or oxygen containing functional groups liu et al 2018a they have a relatively stable chemical structure and could be released only when experiencing acid extraction or high temperature combustion liu et al 2018b fortunately with the assistance of cskel organics acids such as acetic formic and levulinic acid were generated through the decomposition of hemicellulose cellulose and their degradation compounds like furfural derivatives during th process sharma et al 2020 reza et al 2013 under that circumstance the minimum ph value of cskel th pretreated sludge reached 5 4 while this value for th pretreated sludge was only 6 2 fig 5 as a result the formation of hcl soluble k na was inhibited and most of the water soluble and nh4ac soluble k na were removed from the cell residuals after cskel th pretreatment fig 4 c and d what s more it was worth noting that in fig 4 c and d although there was 11 and 9 5 additional k na released from the cell residuals of cskel th pretreated sludges k na proportion in the supernatant only increased by up to 5 0 and 2 3 this result revealed that although cskel th could liberate the trapped k na in the cell residuals more than half of these released k na were re captured by the eps layers 3 2 3 k na species evolution in the eps layers of conditioned sludge the k na species evolution in the eps layers was further investigated to explore the re capture mechanism fig 6 the results showed that compared with the blank conditioning group the re captured k na in eps after cskel th pretreatment were mainly in the forms of water soluble and nh4ac soluble nevertheless the re captured water soluble k na would escape from the eps layers with the rising temperature while the proportions of nh4ac soluble k na were even 18 2 and 18 6 higher than that in the eps of the blank conditioning group fig 6 c and d the nh4ac soluble k na was considered as ion exchangeable which organically bounded with the functional structures like carboxyl groups miller r n 1977 consequently the various organic components in eps were considered to be highly related to the re capture effect of k na 3 2 4 correlation between typical components in eps and trapped k na since the s eps was the outermost eps layer and also had the most obvious re capture effect on k na releasing fig 3 a d it was chosen for characterizing the typical organic matters by eem parafac a three component parafac model was validated using the eem samples of the s eps derived from th pretreated sludge cskel th pretreated sludge and th pretreated cskel fig 7 in this study the fluorescent component 1 c1 displayed two peaks at the excitation emission wavelengths ex em of 275 nm 345 nm and 220 nm 345nm the fluorescent component 2 c2 exhibited a primary peak at 320 nm 400 nm ex em and a secondary peak at 235 395 nm ex em the fluorescent component 3 c3 had a dominant peak at 365 nm 430 nm ex em based on the previous literature the identified c1 could be assigned to protein like substances wells et al 2022 and the c2 and c3 were both classified as humic like substances zhu et al 2021 fellman et al 2009 in addition the humic like substance demonstrating its peak at higher em was considered to have a larger molecule weight lee et al 2015 thus the c2 and c3 were distinguished by the different molecule weights in the order of c2 c3 the correlation between the contents of k na and the typical organics in s eps of cskel th pretreated sludges by multiple regression analysis were given in fig 8 the results showed that c2 and c3 were the most significant factors affecting k na re capture c2 kept increasing with the rising temperature and showed a strong promoting effect on k na re capture whose coefficients were 4 46 for k r2 0 823 and 4 64 for na r2 0 630 this explained the uptrend of the nh4ac soluble k na in the eps of cskel th pretreated sludge because c2 was known as a distinctive metal ions adsorbent in agricultural studies due to its high abundance of oxygen containing groups like phenolic hydroxyl and methoxyl zhao and naeth 2022 zoerb et al 2014 besides c3 showed an inhibition effect on k na re capture whose coefficients were 3 72 for k r2 0 823 and 4 00 for na r2 0 630 fig 8 c this was because c3 humic like substance with high molecule weight was produced by the polymerization of c2 humic like substance with small molecule weight in thermal hydrolysis in this process the dehydration and decarboxylation reactions brought about the elimination of the oxygen containing functional groups so that the binding effect of eps on k na was weakened 3 3 mechanism of ca mg re immobilization 3 3 1 spatial migration of ca mg in sludge organic floc structures different from k na a significant re immobilization phenomenon was observed for ca mg releasing after the turning point of 180 c fig 2 c d and table 3 to find the reasons the spatial migration path of ca mg in sludge floc structures were illustrated in fig 9 during th pretreatment none of the ca mg was detected in the supernatant of the blank groups which meant that all the ca mg in raw sludge were tightly bunded with the eps and cells the ratios of trapped ca mg in eps layers diminished by 13 3 and 20 8 in total at 240 c when compared to the blank group but their ratios in the supernatant only increased by 0 9 and 2 8 fig 9 a and b the majority of released ca mg in eps was transferred into the cell residuals whose proportions reached 97 1 and 92 0 at 240 c the above rules were also suitable for the ca mg after cskel pretreatment but the ca mg proportions in the cell residuals were much lower whose values were only 91 4 and 82 1 at 240 c fig 9 c and d these results suggested that the re immobilized ca mg were mainly located in the cell residuals of sludge and cskel th could inhibit ca mg migration from eps to the cell residuals 3 3 2 ca mg species evolution in the cell residuals of conditioned sludge the sequential extraction experiment of different ca mg species showed that the hcl soluble form was the predominant species in the cell residuals of th pretreated sludge whose proportion rose from 46 3 and 31 1 the blank group to 80 5 and 69 1 at 240 c fig 10 a and b since the hcl extracted ca mg was believed to be acid soluble sediments such as their carbonates phosphates and sulphates jordan and akay 2012 the re immobilization of released ca mg cations turned out to be a precipitation reaction during th pretreatment of sludge the acid compounds were produced like volatile fatty acids which derived from polysaccharides decomposition together with the production of alkaline compounds like amine functional groups which originated from the breakdown of proteins wang and li 2015 under the combined influence of these substances the ph value of th pretreated sludge was always roughly maintained at 7 which was conducive to the formation of ca mg precipitates fig 6 the addition of cskel lowered the ph to a minimum value of 5 4 by that means the balance of ca mg precipitation reaction moved towards the dissolution direction and the maximum ratios of hcl soluble ca mg decreased to 67 0 and 58 4 at 240 c fig 10 c and d at present it could be preliminarily determined that the re immobilized ca mg in the cell residuals was attributed to the precipitation of the released ca mg cations from the eps layers but the binding form of these hcl soluble precipitates still remained unclear 3 3 3 binding forms of hcl soluble ca mg in the cell residuals of conditioned sludge according to the study of lu et al 2022 the ions produced in thermal hydrolysis process which could form hcl soluble precipitates with ca mg cations mainly included carbonate sulfate and phosphate based on this the carbonates and sulfates content changes in the cell residuals of conditioned sludge were measured by xps to find out their potential relationship with ca mg re immobilization more detailed results for xps peak fittings can be seen in fig s6 whether in th or cskel th pretreatment the content of metal carbonate and metal sulfate generally showed a downward trend from 120 c to 240 c table 4 which was opposite to the growing trend of hcl soluble ca mg in the cell residuals the linear regression results in table 4 also showed that both carbonates and sulfates exhibited weak relations with hcl soluble ca mg changes r2 0 6022 for carbonates and r2 0 0287 for sulfates therefore the hcl soluble precipitates of ca mg were proved not to exist mainly in the form of carbonates or sulfates the different p species in the cell residuals of conditioned sludge were thus characterized and the results showed that only the content of aip inorganic phosphorus dominated by ca mg p always kept growing with the increasing temperatures whether in th and cskel th pretreated sludge fig 11 a the correlation analysis in fig 11 b showed that the increase of re immobilized hcl soluble ca mg has a strong and extremely significant relationship with the changes of aip r2 0 9703 and p value 0 005 since this accurate fitting result was derived from the values of two different reaction systems both th and cskel th pretreated sludge and all the data points were located within the 95 confidence interval it was reasonable to conclude that the ca mg p was the predominant species of the hcl soluble ca mg precipitates what s more the cell residuals of raw sludge and cskel th pretreated sludge at 240 c were selected for the epma testing and the distribution of ca mg and p elements in the cell residuals was visually illustrated in fig 12 a it could be observed that the initial ca mg in the microbial cells was not always accompanied by p for example ca in the position of 1 2 as well as mg in the position of 1 2 3 showed inconsistent distribution behaviors with p at the corresponding places nevertheless after cskel th pretreatment the distribution of ca mg and p tended to be uniform and consistent which further supported the conclusion that ca mg re immobilization was due to the formation of phosphate precipitates according to fig 12 b c the eps layers only contained 4 of total p in raw sludge so the increase of aip mainly came from the decomposition of organic p in the cell residuals thereby the ca mg re immobilization mechanism was concluded as follows th led to the simultaneous release of ca mg cations in the eps and the bio phosphorus in microbial cells who combined with each other to form ca mg p precipitates and finally transferred into the cell residuals 4 conclusion this work explored the removal behaviors of aaem in sludge during both th and cskel th pretreatments then further illuminated the dissociation mechanism by revealing the aaem spatial migration and chemical species evolution in sludge biological structures the results show that the reaction temperature and cskel addition were two dominant roles in aaem removal high temperature 240 c could effectively dissociate water soluble k na in eps but the rest k na in eps was absorbed by the humic matters as nh4ac soluble form the water nh4ac soluble k na in cells was also converted to hcl soluble form with stronger stability and left in cell residuals meanwhile ca mg in eps and the bio phosphorus in microbial cells were released simultaneously when the temperature exceeded 180 c they combined with each other to form hcl soluble ca mg p precipitate so that over 90 of ca mg was left in cell residuals instead of being removed as for cskel addition the hemicellulose cellulose in sawdust was degraded to produce organic acids which reduce the ph values of cskel th pretreated sludge from 7 5 to 5 4 the weak acidic environment effectively hindered the formation of hcl soluble k na and ca mg p precipitate in the cell residuals as a result the removal rates of k na ca mg in cskel th pretreated sludge were raised to 55 5 72 5 9 3 and 44 6 separately the above conclusions indicated that appropriately raising the th temperature and using cskel with high hemicellulose cellulose content are suitable pretreatment methods for avoiding aaem induced problems in sludge
