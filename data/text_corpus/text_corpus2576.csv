12880,an increasing amount of spent coffee grounds scg has resulted in a huge burden on landfills thus alternative viable technologies are needed the hydrothermal carbonization of scg was studied to determine to produce high quality hydrochar the influence of three independent variables temperature reaction duration and solid to liquid ratio on the yield of hydrochar and conversion was investigated through 15 experimental runs using central composite design ccd the most optimized conversion and hydrochar yield results were 89 8 and 10 1 respectively higher heating value hhv progressed considerably from 19 1 mj kg of scg to 21 2 mj kg of hydrochar the ultimate analysis results for hydrochar revealed that the quantity of carbon c upgraded from 50 1 to 55 9 whereas oxygen o content decreased from 40 5 to 38 7 hence improving the energy and combustion properties the scanning electron microscopy sem analysis portrayed the alteration in the structure of scg and improved porosity after hydrothermal processing which was further investigated via brunauer emmett teller bet analysis bet surface area improved from 4 4 m2 g for scg to 16 5 m2 g for hydrochar the thermal stability of hydrochar was upgraded from 330 c for scg to 375 c for hydrochar graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords spent coffee grounds hydrothermal carbonization hydrochar central composite design data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction australia has recently been concerned about circular economy implementation particularly after china banned waste imports from overseas countries including australia in january 2018 accordingly australia has prioritized collecting recyclable waste resources recovering them and reusing them urgently across the country in the circular economy waste resources are utilized as long as possible maximum value energy is recovered and products are regenerated at the end of process 1 as of 2017 2018 161 million 60 kg bags of coffee were consumed globally creating 9 6 million tonnes of solid waste 2 scgs are rich in organic matter mainly comprising cellulose from 8 6 to 13 3 wt oil from 10 to 20 wt hemicellulose from 30 to 40 wt and lignin from 25 to 33 wt 3 which enables them to attract for energy recovery devotions commercially the direct employment of pure scgs as logs or pellets in boilers is unfeasible consequently it has caused lower efficiency of boilers along with the substantial amounts of particulate matter pm2 5 and nitrogen oxidants nox emissions 4 on the other hand the anaerobic co digestion of scgs with sewage sludge substrate is favorable whereas the mono digestion of scgs substrate is disposed to failure and has restrictions particularly in long term stability concerns 5 6 scgs are a renewable energy source i e rich in lipids carbohydrates and phenolic bioactive compounds and hence may be used for value added product applications the raw scg powder comprises oil proteins phenolic compounds cellulose hemicelluloses minerals and melanoidins 7 the mean protein content of scg is about 13 6 8 moreover scgs do not contest food products however their bulk production may be advantageous for their economical and secondary reuse notably the scgs may be recycled directly with slight alterations as composting essences for organic farming and adsorption material for phenols and metal ions the scgs may also be combusted as fuel due to their high calorific value it is important to note that the surface treated scgs or scgs improved with additives may also be utilized as filler materials for both non biodegradable and biodegradable polymers the direct utilization of scgs may be observed as one of the economically beneficial routes the composition of scgs allows for providing a resilient platform for a circular economy the conversion of scgs was also investigated for the production of liquid biofuels such as bioethanol biodiesel and bio oil via enzymatic hydrolysis transesterification and hydrothermal pyrolysis liquefaction techniques respectively 3 9 12 in general the conversion techniques involve several factors such as feedstock properties lower moisture ash and higher carbon reactive environment high temperature pressure inert atmospheres pre treatment stages evenness of feedstock drying extraction and use of chemicals which are usually extracted from fossils for instance the comparatively high temperature environments 400 600 c related to pyrolysis and the prerequisite of dried feedstock will have substantial energy and cost consequences for dealing scgs which are with a high moisture content of about 50 60 wt 10 besides the literature also showing that oil extraction methods involving biodiesel production from scgs are time consuming and energy demanding hence necessitate a substantial quantity of solvents and have low output 13 14 hydrothermal carbonization htc is a thermo chemical process for transforming lignocellulose into char in subcritical water at the temperature and pressure ranges of 180 280 c and 2 10 mpa respectively a specific reaction time the characteristics of water under subcritical thermodynamic regime are distinctive within the temperature and pressure ranges of 100 to 374 c and 1 to 22 1 mpa respectively 15 16 under these ranges water be able to dissolve nonpolar constituents due to decrease in dielectric constant in comparison with room temperature water the resulting water may be utilized as a medium not only for hydrolysis but also the extraction of organic molecules as well as biomolecule compounds 17 this study is focused on htc technique over other thermochemical conversion methods due to its low temperature requirements and ability to synthesize organic compounds with high moisture impregnated biomass without pre treatment 18 19 since htc is a more economical and environmentally friendly method than the most widely used biochar conversion technique pyrolysis it was chosen for the study unlike htc pyrolysis requires high temperatures and energy demand 20 slow pyrolysis and htc are commonly employing thermochemical processes pyrolysis is the breakdown of feedstock at higher temperatures 600 c in the attendance of a restricted oxygen environment hence the solid product is commonly known as biochar 21 htc is carried out in the water existence and is not affected by the high water content in the feedstock therefore this distinctive benefit enables htc a promising method for treating biomass with high water content 22 htc derived char has the additional advantage of having the highest solid content 80 and the lowest liquid and gaseous content 17 23 in htc the temperature beyond 180 c and the extractable oligomeric and monomeric fraction is released from biomass usually these compounds are either partitioned in the aqueous source or condensed back on the surface of solid following the decomposition of these highly reactive intermediates a network polymerization aromatization and condensation of reactions consequences in htc chars or coke herein called secondary chars the secondary char deposits on top of the primary char form a network of undissolved cellulose and lignin fragments 24 25 hydrochars have a greater amount of fixed carbon and a lower h c and o c molecular ratio than their feedstocks making them excellent for solid fuels pollutant elimination soil alteration and a range of other applications 26 hydrochar produced by htc is far greater than whatever can be obtained from any other solid char conversion process that this study was conducted for the key aim was to get a maximal amount of hydrochar the previous thermo chemical characterizations of hydrochar from scg via htc were not ample and adequate for numerous purposes for instance energy production and wastewater adsorption capability thus a comprehensive characterization of scg and hydrochar has been explored the main objective of this study was to explore the potential of bioenergy in hydrochar and physicochemical properties via htc scg and hydrochar were analyzed and compared based on some critical process parameters physicochemical characteristics surface area pore volume pore diameter chemical and phase morphological elemental analysis structural crystallinity and thermal behavior of hydrochars 2 materials and methods 2 1 statistical optimization statistical optimization has been used to improve efficiency by eliminating time and costs while performing extensive research work on how functions and processes are affected by interactions between factors with central composite design ccd comprehensive studies can be conducted systematically and methodically on a limited number of variables rather than on an individual parameter at a time ccd is used to solve quadratic and cubic equations it is used to optimize the response variables and the corresponding process variables and it is used to solve second order polynomial equations all variables in this process are assigned a numerical value besides their numerical value 1 0 or 1 based on their numerical value as illustrated in table 1 using two levels of factors plus or minus and two levels of the axial and centre points to estimate curvature generally total experiments n 2 k 2 k n where k and n denotes the number of factors and number of repetitions respectively the average space between the centre and the factorial point is 1 by each element and the distance between the centre and the star point is ǀαǀ 1 whereas α is based on the design and factors it has been employed to identify if an object is orthogonal spherical and face centred spherical and even the real value is used to evaluate if it is spherical orthogonal spherical and face centred spherical it must be allocated as α 2 k 1 4 with 2 k as factorial runs when alpha values are equal to 1 in face centred design the relationship among responses and independent parameters is detailed as 1 y β 0 i 1 k β i χ i i 1 k β ii χ ii 2 i 1 k i j 1 k β ij χ i χ j where y indicates the response k represents the independent variables β0 indicates the intercept i ii ij and β are coefficient of linear quadratic and interaction respectively the coded levels of independent variables are represented by xi and xj 2 2 experimental design the prime objective of the research was to examine the product distribution obtained from hydrothermal carbonization htc of scg based on the most critical parameters the reaction temperature reaction duration and the solid liquid ratio significantly affect the yield and properties of htc products the ccd was used to investigate three process factors interacting with the conversion and yields of hydrochar from scg the operating temperature range x1 is 230 290 c the reaction duration x2 is 60 120 min and the ratio of liquid to solvent x3 is 1 1 1 15 1 20 the effect of reaction temperature time and solid loadings was investigated using a restricted ccd as illustrated in table 1 three operational factors were employed to maximize the conversion and production of hydrochar using 15 trials to ensure accuracy the ccd data was fitted to the following polynomial second order equation shown below using the factor levels 2 y x 0 x 1 a x 2 b x 3 c x 12 ab x 13 ac x 23 bc x 11 a 2 x 22 b 2 x 33 c 2 models include linear terms interaction and quadratic effects for the temperature time and solid loadings the model is evaluated using the regression co efficient r2 p value f value and relative square error rse however p values are used to assess the importance of each variable based on response surfaces analysis the effect of each variable was determined only by statistically significant coefficients a single replicate of the center point was used to assess the experimental error of htc products and the separation process likewise because the complexity of product separation varies considerably the average and standard deviation for the existing batches may not represent the experimental error as the parameters are converted to the factor levels the simulations of models are displayed in tables throughout the data table the full factorial ccd matrix with three variables in natural units and the conversion and hydrochar yield are depicted in table 2 2 3 materials the scgs were sourced from reground australia the hydrogen to carbon h c ratio oxygen to carbon o c ratio proximate and ultimate analyses of scg are shown in table 3 2 4 hydrothermal carbonization as shown in fig 1 a supplementary file and fig 1 b the experiments were conducted in a 600 ml parr reactor typically filled with scg and 300 ml of water as solvent the nitrogen n2 was purged into the reactor to remove the air afterward it was heated to an appropriate operating temperature ranging from 230 c to 290 c and it was held at the acquired temperature for one to 2 h with components being agitated at 500 rpm our previous research has described the detailed separation of different htc products 27 the hydrochar yield were calculated by using the eq 3 3 hydrochar yield w char m char m scg 100 where mchar refers to the char weight g mscg is the weight of scg g 2 5 analytical methods ultimate analyses of feed material and the final product were analyzed using chns o elemental analyzer perkins elmer 2400

relation between hhv and lhv was calculated using eq 6 the main functional groups exist on the surface of the feeding material and both liquid and solid products have been investigated by using ftir perkinelmer ftir spectrometer ta 8000 at wave number analysis ranging from 4000 to 600 cm 1 with a resolution of 4 cm 1 on the other hand the specific surfaces were measured and computed by employing the brunauer emmett teller method bet using the asap2020 at 77 k and n2 as adsorbate the microporous zone smicro surface external sext and microporous volume vmicro were calculated by employing t plot method in addition the total pore volume vtotal was assessed from the volume of adsorbed n2 at a relative pressure p p 0 0 96 the degassing temperature was set at 120 c scg and hydrochars were examined using x ray diffractometer with specification bruker d4 endeavor samples were analyzed at the range of 5 65 2θ with current of 100 ma and 40 kv voltage the peak strengths were documented at 0 02 at a sweep rate of 1 0 2θ min the thermogravimetric analysis of scg and hydrochars was determined by using a perkin elmer thermogravimetric analyzer sta 600 with the samples heated up to 800 c using a constant heating rate of 20 c min under nitrogen atmosphere proximate analysis was conducted on both the scg and hydrochar using the tga method described by volpe m et al 29 the fixed carbon was calculated by eq 6 6 fixed carbon 100 moisture volatile matter ash scanning electron microscopy sem with model philips xl30 sussex england was used under high vacuum mode with operating voltage of 15 kv and spot size of 4 5 5 mm 2 6 kinetic study the model free kinetic fitting is the best technique to scrutinize the kinetic data obtained from tga kissinger akahira sunose kas model deals the approximation of arrhenius parameter such as activation energy e kas model is widely employed to compute the thermal breakdown of solid material like biomass using arrhenius equation 7 k k 0 exp e rt where the k0 r and e signify the pre exponential factor 1 s general gas constant 8 314 j k mol and activation energy j mol respectively 3 results and discussions 3 1 effect of temperature the reaction temperature is considered one of the most important parameters in hydrothermal carbonization htc temperature plays a crucial role in disintegrating biomass bonds through the heat of disintegration htc was carried out at temperatures ranging from 230 to 290 c while other conditions were held constant 1 1 solid to water ratio w v and 90 min reaction time fig 2 illustrates the effect of temperature on the ratio of hydrochar to solids yields from htc of scg which shows that lower temperatures lead to maximum solids production the solid production declines with increasing temperatures while liquid and gaseous products increase the hydrochar yield decreases from 21 to 10 2 while conversion increases from 78 9 to 89 8 as the temperature rises from 230 to 260 c htc operating temperature leads to increased thermolysis fragmentation and solubilization of macromolecules in scgs resulting in a reduction in solid yield with increasing temperature 30 with the increase in reaction temperature from 260 c to 290 c the hydrochar yield declined significantly the higher decline in hydrochar yield was observed when reaction temperature was raised from 260 c to 290 c hence dependable with temperature ranges that were effective for disintegrating cellulosic amounts and considerably lignin content 31 32 this process also triggers substantial cellulose degradation under hydrothermal conditions above 210 c 33 in earlier research conversion increased rapidly as reaction temperature increased from 180 c to 280 c 34 jindal and jha 35 found that there was an increase in the total conversion of sawdust under liquefaction from 37 5 to 61 6 previous studies have demonstrated that raising reaction temperatures under subcritical circumstances improved lowers the hydrochar yield 36 37 additionally higher temperatures and pressure lowered the dielectric constant of water resulting in the water molecules losing their polarity and organic matter becoming more miscible with water molecules furthermore increasing the temperature resulted in accelerated bond fragmentation hydrolysis and repolymerization reactions resulting in reduction in hydrochar and an increment in bio oil yield 38 carbonization results in a greater amount of liquid and gaseous products at higher temperatures and a lesser amount of solid products our findings align with those published in many other articles on the liquefaction of lignocellulosic biomass 27 39 41 3 2 effect of reaction time htc is considered a slow reaction depending on the htc model the reaction time ranges from minutes to several days although reaction time effects hydrolysis reactions it only impacts them until a certain time point beyond which it has no effect htc was carried out at different reaction times ranging between 60 and 120 min while other conditions were held constant 1 1 solid to water ratio w v and 260 c reaction temperature fig 3 shows the hydrochar yield increased as time increased from 16 2 to 17 5 this may be attributed to the long reaction time responsible for the breakdown of the bio oil and supported higher gas yields and solid mass residue hence increased reaction times decreased the bio oil yield wt significantly whereas the gaseous yield and char formation were favored 42 this is predominantly triggered by network of reactions i e the re polymerization and condensation in summary the reaction time keeps a proficient role in the breakdown of the material nonetheless re polymerization and condensation reactions owing to higher processing time m typically consequences in a higher hydrochar yield 3 3 effect of solid and liquid ratio to examine the influence of biomass to water ratio the htc experiments were performed at different solid to liquid ranging in between 1 1 1 5 while other conditions were held constant reaction time 60 min and reaction temperature 260 c the result of the hydrochar and conversion are presented in fig 4 a higher yield of hydrochar was obtained at lower biomass to water ratio and a lesser hydrochar yield was obtained at higher biomass to water ratio the hydrochar yield of 17 2 was obtained at a biomass to water ratio 1 1 w v which declined to 16 5 when the biomass to water ratio fluctuated to 1 5 w v hence resembled the results of previous 43 nizamuddin et al 2016 explored the effect of biomass water ratio on palm shell via htc process the results revealed that yield of hydrochar declined marginally as biomass water ratio varied from 1 10 to 1 60 w v this lower hydrochar yield at a higher biomass to water ratio attributed to the higher biomass water ratio leading to lower carbonization 44 3 4 optimization of conversion and hydrochar 3 4 1 analysis of variance anova only 15 experimental runs were designed in the experimental process which could not instinctively acquire the optimal conditions therefore the application of response surface methodology rsm assisted in establishing the functional correlation among the targeted responses and factors along with provisions of response effect each other and optimal condition as depicted in table 4 the regression analysis results provided a higher f value of 255 7581 while the lesser p value 0 05 of 0 000017 indicates that the model items are significant besides it can be seen from fig 5 that there was a negligible deviation among the actual and predicted results i e regression coefficient r2 of 0 981 each hence the regression analysis could predict the best approximation of the yields i e conversion and hydrochar 3 4 2 response surface plots and optimization fig 6 shows the three dimensional 3d graphs for the conversion and yield obtained at different ranges of applied parameters bio char yield was negatively impacted correlated with temperature and solid to liquid ratio the hydrochar yield was reduced as the temperature and solid to liquid increased from 230 to 290 c 0 and 1 1 to 1 5 respectively the upsurge in the three parameters supported the thermal degradation and dissolution of sludge macromolecules hence decreased the solid yield higher temperature reduced the water s viscosity and assisted its rupturing into pores of hydrochar to encourage biomass breakdown 18 25 the major reduction in hydrochar yield was experienced when the reaction temperature was elevated from 260 c to 290 c in such a case the decline in hydrochar is usually observed due to the substantial collapse of hemicellulose and lignin in this temperature range and the huge total of cellulose breakdown when the temperature above 210 c 45 instead the negative correspondence among the reaction temperature and hydrochar yield was credited to certain factors for instance 1 scg contains massive content of nitrogen originating compounds proteins and protein sugar hydrolysates which are dissolved in the aqueous phase 46 and 2 the production of hydrochar is little problematic due to the thermal decay of proteins at 250 c on the other hand acetic acid is a prime organic acid formed during htc via dehydration and hydrolysis of straight chain polymers or monomers in existence with subcritical water 47 the existence of organic acids elevates the concentration of protons or hydroxide ions therefore enhancing the total ion concentration and supporting dehydration and decarboxylation 48 in addition to that the acids also boost dehydration which is the key carbonization mechanism consequently significant reduction in the oxygen content of hydrochar occurs to follow that the previous study revealed that hydrochar yield could be enhanced by reducing the reaction time 49 this behavior was attributed to the de polymerization of bio macromolecules in scg and the additional decomposition of the resulting intermediates through cleavage dehydration and decarboxylation reactions however hydrochar yield increased as the reaction time increased from 16 2 to 17 5 this may be attributed to the long reaction time incurred in the disintegration of the bio oil which ultimately favored the gas and solid residue yields another study reported resembling trends that mainly focused on reaction time s influence on l cubeba seed hence the increase in reaction times decreased the bio oil yield wt while the higher reaction time promotes the gaseous and char products 42 hence this phenomenon is primarily triggered out by re polymerization and condensation reactions in summary the reaction time offers a dominating behavior during the material breakdown however re polymerization and condensation reactions owing to higher processing time produce higher yield of hydrochar 3 5 characterization of hydrochar 3 5 1 thermal stability and oxidative reactivity of hydrochars thermogravimetric analysis tga is a recognized analytical method aimed to evaluate the combustion profile of any solid feedstock to investigate the thermal reactivity and degradation stages associated with temperature thermogravimetric tg and derivative thermogravimetric dtg curves are very helpful in determining the thermal behavior of the materials as shown in fig 7 a b decomposition was categorized into three key temperature oriented stages 0 to 150 c 250 to 350 c and 350 c onwards final temperature the initial weight loss 0 to 150 c is associated with water removal and lighter volatiles mainly with dehydration and decarboxylation reaction 25 50 the second subsequent stage characterizes the rapid breakdown of composite volatiles and considerable weight loss in the temperature range 250 to 350 c in the second stage primary degradation of biomass occurs due to the collapse of cellulose and hemicellulose 27 this process is sustained up to 550 c hence the complete decomposition of cellulose and hemicellulose and a lesser extent of lignin occurred 51 it is important to note that the dtg curves acquired for the hydrochars see fig 7b expose the three discrete peaks after water removal the first noticeable weight loss was observed from 100 to 250 c with unique peaks at about 215 5 c credited to the release of light volatile another set of noticeable peaks trails appeared between 250 and 370 c summiting about 320 10 c hence also associated with the release of volatile matters a noteworthy weight loss rate between 0 5 and 1 35 c contingent on the process conditions arose as the secondary volatile evolution for all hydrochar samples notably the hydrochar was either recovered at 200 c or after 200 c hence exhibited two phased volatile release stage the initial volatile release specifies the occurrence of short chain hydrocarbons 52 caused by the disintegration of scgs long chain polymers short chain hydrocarbon monomer production with elevating reaction temperature might elucidate why the initial releasing volatiles peaks become more obvious for hydrochars acquired at and after 200 c it also indicates that momentous breakdown of scgs lignocellulosic through the htc process activated around 200 c to conclude the final clear peak summiting around 492 20 c appeared between 370 c and 550 c which is ascribed to the char decomposition tga profile for both the samples was observed to flat curves which showed the unconverted part in the form of ash to estimate the energy consumed during the process the kinetic parameters is essential therefore usually calculated by arrhenius equation in our case the activation energy e was estimated by the non isothermal isoconversional technique using kissinger akahira sunose kas model the values of e for stage 1 stage 2 and stage 3 were calculated as 43 65 8 kj mol for stage 1 79 65 6 kj mol for stage 2 and 93 65 4 kj mol for stage 3 comparatively higher e was estimated for stage 2 primarily due to higher weight loss as shown in fig 7b 3 5 2 surface area pore diameter and pore volume analysis of hydrochars the adsorption desorption isotherms by employing n2 conferring to the bet technique for the three hydrochars are illustrated in fig 8 a c therefore the structural synergy between micropores and the mesopores can be easily seen fig 8 a c shows that the pore size dispersal of three samples was analyzed using the barrett joyner and halenda bjh method the surface area pore volume they are provided in table 5 the results demonstrate that the specific surface was significantly improved from 4 4 m2 g for scg to 16 5 m2 g for hydrochar obtained at 290 c the strengthening in surface area pore volume and pore width was accredited to the process temperature and time leading to the huge decomposition of the structure of the scg hence resulting in an upgraded structural characteristic of hydrochar i e porosity additionally fig 9 illustrates the pore size distribution of hydrochars which reveals the presence of micropores 0 4 nm mesopores 0 40 nm and macropores 40 nm and onwards in the hydrochars this shape indicates an uneven distribution of pore sizes under low relative pressure and hysteresis in desorption indicates mesopores as well as micropores in small amounts 53 the sem results have also validated an intensification in porosity and adaptation of the structure of the hydrochar after hydrothermal processing the bet surface area was perceived to be amended by rising the temperature for a reason of improved volatiles evolution which eventually intensifies the pore expansion of hydrochar 54 moreover higher temperatures destruct the walls between contiguous pores which causes pore widening in addition the reaction time in combination with reaction temperature also strongly disturbs the char s surface area moreover the longer residence time and lower temperature consequences in higher surface area 55 the upsurge in surface area ascribed to the tunneling effects of hydrothermal processing mass transfer and heating processes 30 which eroded the fiber structure of scg hence causing the creation of several pores thus increasing the bet surface area and total pore volume 56 3 5 3 structural analysis of hydrochars fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy is an established tool to detect structural alterations in chemical configurations ftir is an appropriate technique for ascertaining the structural resemblance of pure material conversely it is also utilized to scrutinize modifications in biomass after subjected to thermochemical treatment even though the biomass is heterogeneous material several peaks are usually perceived owing to bonds of organic compounds ftir investigation was focused on identifying the functional groups of the samples and recognizing the resulting alteration in the structure after htc treatment 58 as shown in fig 10 and table 6 in supplementary material the oh functional groups symbolized by transmittance peaks were detected at 3254 cm 1 for scg and 3309 cm 1 3299 cm 1 and 3305 cm 1 for different hydrochars obtained at 230 c 260 c and 290 c respectively as shown in fig 9 the scg samples had a strong peak 3500 to 3000 cm 1 compared to hydrochars which suggested that the presence of oh bonds of carboxyl groups is higher in scg than hydrochars these peaks might be accredited to moisture presence phenol or its derivatives and or alcohols 34 59 few peaks related to ch stretching of ch ch2 and ch3 were observed at 2894 cm 1 for scg and 3052 cm 1 hc 230 c 3005 cm 1 hc 260 c and 3016 hc 290 c 60 the co stretching peak for scg was observed at 1705 cm 1 for hydrochar obtained at 230 c 260 c and 290 c observed at 1651 cm 1 and 1688 and 1704 cm 1 presenting the probable existence of carboxylic acids aldehydes and ketones co stretching of scg adjacent to 1700 cm 1 was found resilient indicating a higher amount of alkyl group compounds present than hydrochars the bond at 1454 cm 1 might be consigned to ch bending vibration in methyl groups peaks in the range of 1450 1600 cm 1 analogous to cc stretching authorizing the occurrence aliphatic and alkyl aromatics 61 the variation in the peaks of scg and chars ranging from 1325 to 1450 cm 1 could be credited to the stretching of co 34 while the peaks detected at the ranges 1000 1325 cm 1 associated to oh blending and co stretching which may be allied to the co co h and coc and 62 3 5 4 chns and hhv analysis of hydrochars table 7 shows the elemental analysis proximate and higher heating and lower heating value of hydrochars produced at different conditions the results proposed that the resulting hydrochar was produced by concurrent improvement of carbon amount and elimination of oxygen content during hydrothermal treatment hence enhancing the combustion and energy characteristics of hydrochar the initial properties of hydrochar differ significantly from scg as shown in tables 7 and 1 respectively the fixed carbon significantly increased from 6 2 to 46 1 after hydrothermal processing and the volatile matter decreased from 60 6 to 51 8 this may be attributed to organic carbon converted into the furanic compounds during the htc 63 64 the initial ash content of scg was 0 30 as compared to hydrochars obtained at different temperatures which is essentially owing to the reduction in solid mass during the htc the inorganic compounds precipitate into the solid phase and soluble organic species pass into the liquid phase 65 similar results were reported by arauzo pj et al 66 table 7 shows the carbon content improved from 50 1 to 53 9 while oxygen and hydrogen contents declined from 7 2 5 3 and 40 7 38 7 respectively the boosting in carbon and declination in oxygen amounts suggested that hydrothermal processing has transformed scg into higher energy containing fuel i e comparable to brown coal 67 in general the higher oxygen amount in biomass biofuels is unfavorable since it decline the hhv and also becomes a massive cause of corrosion and thermal instability it is important to note that an increment in carbon and declination in hydrogen and oxygen amounts were mainly accredited to the reasonable effect of reaction temperature and time as well as the simultaneous deoxygenating reactions occurring during the hydrothermal process 68 kannan et al 2017a experienced a matching trend i e the carbon was augmented from 37 0 to 49 0 while the oxygen declined from 50 67 to 39 31 when the reaction time was increased from 60 to 120 min 69 another study conducted on hydrothermal treatment of fish waste reported that the quantity of carbon boosted from 27 0 to 50 0 and oxygen declined from 65 0 to 37 0 when reaction time was increased from 60 to 120 min 70 these huge variations in the results of elemental analysis after hydrothermal processing might be additionally explored and associated to fuel quality in assistance with h c and o c atomic ratios as depicted in table 7 the o c and h c ratios of hydrochar were equated with scg and coal types 71 therefore it can be established that in terms quality fuel the obtained hydrochar is as better as to different coal types moreover the h c and o c atomic ratios of hydrochar were found lower than scg signifying that the aromaticity was progressively upgraded 72 in addition the lower values of o c and h c of hydrochar than that of scg advocate that decarboxylation demethylation and dehydration reactions occurred during the hydrothermal 69 h c assessed the magnitude of these reactions and o c ratio was evaluated with conventional energy sources in general a compound with lower h c and o c atomic ratios is mainly because of the reaction temperature and reaction time during hydrothermal processing 73 on the other hand hhv is deliberated a dynamic representative of biomass and hydrochar hence decides the quantity of possessed energy 73 in our case the hhv of hydrochar was increased up to 21 2 mj kg after hydrothermal treatment in general it is perceived that the hhv of hydrochar was almost alike to brown coal and higher than some of low rank coals for instance the charcoal lignite and peat with hhv of 23 mj kg 16 3 mj kg and 13 8 20 5 mj kg respectively because the hhv of hydrochar is relative to the amount of carbon and amount of carbon is linked with reaction temperature 67 3 5 5 morphological analysis of hydrochars all samples show high porosity over the whole surface with certain heterogeneity as shown in fig 11 there was a honeycomb like structure was observed in the samples hydrochar obtained at 290 c has a merely uneven and highly porous structure with a larger pore depth than obtained in the case of other hydrochars mainly by the devastation of fibrous structures it is understandable since the key objective of the chemical activation is to eradicate the organics and terminate the links among the functional groups 74 75 which authorizes the greater value of sbet 16 5 m2 g gotten and the substantial capability of adsorption material moreover the images revealed that the surface of hydrochars is rough and has different sizes of cavities they may be regarded as channels on the surfaces of unprocessed coffee raw materials which are useful for the adsorption of pollutants 76 pores formation on the surface of hydrochar credited to the reaction time and temperature because at high reaction time highly supports the intensive breaking of cellulose and hemicellulose which results in formation the pores 77 the scg are broken down considerably at higher temperature hence consequences contact of elementary layers of biomass consequently in an enhancement in the porosity of hydrochar which is in consistent with previous study marx et al 2014 reported that the walls between contiguous pores are damaged at higher temperature triggering an expansion of pores 78 3 5 6 crystallinity analysis the crystallinity of scg and different hydrochar samples was investigated via xrd analysis as depicted in fig 12 from the xrd patterns of scg and hydrochars hc 230 c hc 260 c hc 290 c as shown in fig 11 broad peaks with 2θ at around 23 appeared on scg and all hydrochar samples suggesting the presence of an ordered graphitic structure 79 typically different representative peaks appeared at 2θ for 16 25 and 35 and around 68o which are distinctively peaks for cellulose 80 peaks were positioned between 10 and 35 2θ hence strongly endorsed to deflection of amorphous carbon 68 indicating that scg were carbonized as carbon the crystallinity peak for hydrochars appeared between 20 and 25 at 2θ specifying lesser amount of amorphous solids organic removing components and sufficient material stability the crystallinity percentage increased for hydrochar from scg an escalation in crystallinity thru hydrothermal processing could be ascribed to eliminating amorphous constituents hemicellulose and lignin present in coffee grounds 81 a study carried out by liu et al 2017 reported that an upsurge in crystallinity of hydrochar during the hydrothermal processing is accredited to hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose fraction in the amorphous region a similar study also stated that crystallinity depends on the reaction temperature therefore it decreases when the temperature increases 82 3 5 7 physicochemical properties of biochar and hydrochar and their applications different thermochemical processes operate at different process conditions hence producing different final products with different characteristics in our case the physicochemical characterization was carried for the industrial and environmental applications of biochar and hydrochar table 8 shows the characterization of biochar and hydrochar based on elemental analysis hhv and surface area analysis for both the yield of solid and h c o c ratios were reduced while the energy density was improved when the reaction time and temperature were increased it was observed that higher process temperature was the most influence parameter for controlling the product and physicochemical characteristics hhv of lignin was significantly higher than that of the hemicellulose and therefore eliminating hemicellulose from biomass would yield a product with improved lignin quantity as well as improved energy density 83 notably the breakdown of hemicellulose was observed more rapid in htc process than in slow pyrolysis mainly because of the existence of subcritical water thus as anticipated the energy density for the hydrochar was observed higher in comparison with biochar in slow pyrolysis regime 84 the discrepancies in structural and surficial characteristics of both the chars were essentially owing to the different reaction mediums used both processes i e htc and slow pyrolysis hence the different reaction mechanism as well as different compounds on the other hand the pyrolysis of biomass 400 c usually leads to larger surface areas and porous chars 85 for this reason many wood types with surface areas up to 350 m2 g after pyrolysis at 500 c 86 therefore the porosity of hydrochar has been reported to be low 87 during the htc process the raw biomass transforms to coal resembling material with upgraded physicochemical characteristics that can be employed as a substitute to coal moreover the development of hydronium ions catalyzes the collapse of hemicellulose polysaccharides causing in generation of intermediate products such as aldehydes levulinic formic acids lactic and aceticpropenoic and phenolic compounds that may possibly be employed during chemical manufacturing 4 conclusion hydrothermal carbonization htc of scg was conducted to promote energy recovery bioenergy from spent coffee grounds in this study the management of scgs through landfilling has led to a massive cost and environmental impact since it is primarily a waste biomass product by using htc we can maximize the energy density of solid fuels thereby producing a much more suitable solid fuel the optimized hydrochar yield was achieved at 290 c 90 min and 1 1 the reaction time was the least important factor observed from anova analysis the hhv of hydrochar was improved from 19 5 mj kg to 21 2 mj kg sem analysis clearly shows an increment in the number of pores on the surface of hydrochars was verified by bet analysis surface area of hydrochar was enlarged from 4 4 m2 g to 16 5 m2 g the activation energy values using kissinger akahira sunose model were estimated to 43 65 8 kj mol for stage 1 79 65 6 kj mol for stage 2 and 93 65 4 kj mol for stage 3 by considering the high calorific value essential for different commercial applications i e industry and power stations it may have a strong potential for replacing coal by itself or in co combustion with coal in residential and industrial applications declaration

12880,an increasing amount of spent coffee grounds scg has resulted in a huge burden on landfills thus alternative viable technologies are needed the hydrothermal carbonization of scg was studied to determine to produce high quality hydrochar the influence of three independent variables temperature reaction duration and solid to liquid ratio on the yield of hydrochar and conversion was investigated through 15 experimental runs using central composite design ccd the most optimized conversion and hydrochar yield results were 89 8 and 10 1 respectively higher heating value hhv progressed considerably from 19 1 mj kg of scg to 21 2 mj kg of hydrochar the ultimate analysis results for hydrochar revealed that the quantity of carbon c upgraded from 50 1 to 55 9 whereas oxygen o content decreased from 40 5 to 38 7 hence improving the energy and combustion properties the scanning electron microscopy sem analysis portrayed the alteration in the structure of scg and improved porosity after hydrothermal processing which was further investigated via brunauer emmett teller bet analysis bet surface area improved from 4 4 m2 g for scg to 16 5 m2 g for hydrochar the thermal stability of hydrochar was upgraded from 330 c for scg to 375 c for hydrochar graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords spent coffee grounds hydrothermal carbonization hydrochar central composite design data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction australia has recently been concerned about circular economy implementation particularly after china banned waste imports from overseas countries including australia in january 2018 accordingly australia has prioritized collecting recyclable waste resources recovering them and reusing them urgently across the country in the circular economy waste resources are utilized as long as possible maximum value energy is recovered and products are regenerated at the end of process 1 as of 2017 2018 161 million 60 kg bags of coffee were consumed globally creating 9 6 million tonnes of solid waste 2 scgs are rich in organic matter mainly comprising cellulose from 8 6 to 13 3 wt oil from 10 to 20 wt hemicellulose from 30 to 40 wt and lignin from 25 to 33 wt 3 which enables them to attract for energy recovery devotions commercially the direct employment of pure scgs as logs or pellets in boilers is unfeasible consequently it has caused lower efficiency of boilers along with the substantial amounts of particulate matter pm2 5 and nitrogen oxidants nox emissions 4 on the other hand the anaerobic co digestion of scgs with sewage sludge substrate is favorable whereas the mono digestion of scgs substrate is disposed to failure and has restrictions particularly in long term stability concerns 5 6 scgs are a renewable energy source i e rich in lipids carbohydrates and phenolic bioactive compounds and hence may be used for value added product applications the raw scg powder comprises oil proteins phenolic compounds cellulose hemicelluloses minerals and melanoidins 7 the mean protein content of scg is about 13 6 8 moreover scgs do not contest food products however their bulk production may be advantageous for their economical and secondary reuse notably the scgs may be recycled directly with slight alterations as composting essences for organic farming and adsorption material for phenols and metal ions the scgs may also be combusted as fuel due to their high calorific value it is important to note that the surface treated scgs or scgs improved with additives may also be utilized as filler materials for both non biodegradable and biodegradable polymers the direct utilization of scgs may be observed as one of the economically beneficial routes the composition of scgs allows for providing a resilient platform for a circular economy the conversion of scgs was also investigated for the production of liquid biofuels such as bioethanol biodiesel and bio oil via enzymatic hydrolysis transesterification and hydrothermal pyrolysis liquefaction techniques respectively 3 9 12 in general the conversion techniques involve several factors such as feedstock properties lower moisture ash and higher carbon reactive environment high temperature pressure inert atmospheres pre treatment stages evenness of feedstock drying extraction and use of chemicals which are usually extracted from fossils for instance the comparatively high temperature environments 400 600 c related to pyrolysis and the prerequisite of dried feedstock will have substantial energy and cost consequences for dealing scgs which are with a high moisture content of about 50 60 wt 10 besides the literature also showing that oil extraction methods involving biodiesel production from scgs are time consuming and energy demanding hence necessitate a substantial quantity of solvents and have low output 13 14 hydrothermal carbonization htc is a thermo chemical process for transforming lignocellulose into char in subcritical water at the temperature and pressure ranges of 180 280 c and 2 10 mpa respectively a specific reaction time the characteristics of water under subcritical thermodynamic regime are distinctive within the temperature and pressure ranges of 100 to 374 c and 1 to 22 1 mpa respectively 15 16 under these ranges water be able to dissolve nonpolar constituents due to decrease in dielectric constant in comparison with room temperature water the resulting water may be utilized as a medium not only for hydrolysis but also the extraction of organic molecules as well as biomolecule compounds 17 this study is focused on htc technique over other thermochemical conversion methods due to its low temperature requirements and ability to synthesize organic compounds with high moisture impregnated biomass without pre treatment 18 19 since htc is a more economical and environmentally friendly method than the most widely used biochar conversion technique pyrolysis it was chosen for the study unlike htc pyrolysis requires high temperatures and energy demand 20 slow pyrolysis and htc are commonly employing thermochemical processes pyrolysis is the breakdown of feedstock at higher temperatures 600 c in the attendance of a restricted oxygen environment hence the solid product is commonly known as biochar 21 htc is carried out in the water existence and is not affected by the high water content in the feedstock therefore this distinctive benefit enables htc a promising method for treating biomass with high water content 22 htc derived char has the additional advantage of having the highest solid content 80 and the lowest liquid and gaseous content 17 23 in htc the temperature beyond 180 c and the extractable oligomeric and monomeric fraction is released from biomass usually these compounds are either partitioned in the aqueous source or condensed back on the surface of solid following the decomposition of these highly reactive intermediates a network polymerization aromatization and condensation of reactions consequences in htc chars or coke herein called secondary chars the secondary char deposits on top of the primary char form a network of undissolved cellulose and lignin fragments 24 25 hydrochars have a greater amount of fixed carbon and a lower h c and o c molecular ratio than their feedstocks making them excellent for solid fuels pollutant elimination soil alteration and a range of other applications 26 hydrochar produced by htc is far greater than whatever can be obtained from any other solid char conversion process that this study was conducted for the key aim was to get a maximal amount of hydrochar the previous thermo chemical characterizations of hydrochar from scg via htc were not ample and adequate for numerous purposes for instance energy production and wastewater adsorption capability thus a comprehensive characterization of scg and hydrochar has been explored the main objective of this study was to explore the potential of bioenergy in hydrochar and physicochemical properties via htc scg and hydrochar were analyzed and compared based on some critical process parameters physicochemical characteristics surface area pore volume pore diameter chemical and phase morphological elemental analysis structural crystallinity and thermal behavior of hydrochars 2 materials and methods 2 1 statistical optimization statistical optimization has been used to improve efficiency by eliminating time and costs while performing extensive research work on how functions and processes are affected by interactions between factors with central composite design ccd comprehensive studies can be conducted systematically and methodically on a limited number of variables rather than on an individual parameter at a time ccd is used to solve quadratic and cubic equations it is used to optimize the response variables and the corresponding process variables and it is used to solve second order polynomial equations all variables in this process are assigned a numerical value besides their numerical value 1 0 or 1 based on their numerical value as illustrated in table 1 using two levels of factors plus or minus and two levels of the axial and centre points to estimate curvature generally total experiments n 2 k 2 k n where k and n denotes the number of factors and number of repetitions respectively the average space between the centre and the factorial point is 1 by each element and the distance between the centre and the star point is ǀαǀ 1 whereas α is based on the design and factors it has been employed to identify if an object is orthogonal spherical and face centred spherical and even the real value is used to evaluate if it is spherical orthogonal spherical and face

coefficient of linear quadratic and interaction respectively the coded levels of independent variables are represented by xi and xj 2 2 experimental design the prime objective of the research was to examine the product distribution obtained from hydrothermal carbonization htc of scg based on the most critical parameters the reaction temperature reaction duration and the solid liquid ratio significantly affect the yield and properties of htc products the ccd was used to investigate three process factors interacting with the conversion and yields of hydrochar from scg the operating temperature range x1 is 230 290 c the reaction duration x2 is 60 120 min and the ratio of liquid to solvent x3 is 1 1 1 15 1 20 the effect of reaction temperature time and solid loadings was investigated using a restricted ccd as illustrated in table 1 three operational factors were employed to maximize the conversion and production of hydrochar using 15 trials to ensure accuracy the ccd data was fitted to the following polynomial second order equation shown below using the factor levels 2 y x 0 x 1 a x 2 b x 3 c x 12 ab x 13 ac x 23 bc x 11 a 2 x 22 b 2 x 33 c 2 models include linear terms interaction and quadratic effects for the temperature time and solid loadings the model is evaluated using the regression co efficient r2 p value f value and relative square error rse however p values are used to assess the importance of each variable based on response surfaces analysis the effect of each variable was determined only by statistically significant coefficients a single replicate of the center point was used to assess the experimental error of htc products and the separation process likewise because the complexity of product separation varies considerably the average and standard deviation for the existing batches may not represent the experimental error as the parameters are converted to the factor levels the simulations of models are displayed in tables throughout the data table the full factorial ccd matrix with three variables in natural units and the conversion and hydrochar yield are depicted in table 2 2 3 materials the scgs were sourced from reground australia the hydrogen to carbon h c ratio oxygen to carbon o c ratio proximate and ultimate analyses of scg are shown in table 3 2 4 hydrothermal carbonization as shown in fig 1 a supplementary file and fig 1 b the experiments were conducted in a 600 ml parr reactor typically filled with scg and 300 ml of water as solvent the nitrogen n2 was purged into the reactor to remove the air afterward it was heated to an appropriate operating temperature ranging from 230 c to 290 c and it was held at the acquired temperature for one to 2 h with components being agitated at 500 rpm our previous research has described the detailed separation of different htc products 27 the hydrochar yield were calculated by using the eq 3 3 hydrochar yield w char m char m scg 100 where mchar refers to the char weight g mscg is the weight of scg g 2 5 analytical methods ultimate analyses of feed material and the final product were analyzed using chns o elemental analyzer perkins elmer 2400

relation between hhv and lhv was calculated using eq 6 the main functional groups exist on the surface of the feeding material and both liquid and solid products have been investigated by using ftir perkinelmer ftir spectrometer ta 8000 at wave number analysis ranging from 4000 to 600 cm 1 with a resolution of 4 cm 1 on the other hand the specific surfaces were measured and computed by employing the brunauer emmett teller method bet using the asap2020 at 77 k and n2 as adsorbate the microporous zone smicro surface external sext and microporous volume vmicro were calculated by employing t plot method in addition the total pore volume vtotal was assessed from the volume of adsorbed n2 at a relative pressure p p 0 0 96 the degassing temperature was set at 120 c scg and hydrochars were examined using x ray diffractometer with specification bruker d4 endeavor samples were analyzed at the range of 5 65 2θ with current of 100 ma and 40 kv voltage the peak strengths were documented at 0 02 at a sweep rate of 1 0 2θ min the thermogravimetric analysis of scg and hydrochars was determined by using a perkin elmer thermogravimetric analyzer sta 600 with the samples heated up to 800 c using a constant heating rate of 20 c min under nitrogen atmosphere proximate analysis was conducted on both the scg and hydrochar using the tga method described by volpe m et al 29 the fixed carbon

where the k0 r and e signify the pre exponential factor 1 s general gas constant 8 314 j k mol and activation energy j mol respectively 3 results and discussions 3 1 effect of temperature the reaction temperature is considered one of the most important parameters in hydrothermal carbonization htc temperature plays a crucial role in disintegrating biomass bonds through the heat of disintegration htc was carried out at temperatures ranging from 230 to 290 c while other conditions were held constant 1 1 solid to water ratio w v and 90 min reaction time fig 2 illustrates the effect of temperature on the ratio of hydrochar to solids yields from htc of scg which shows that lower temperatures lead to maximum solids production the solid production declines with increasing temperatures while liquid and gaseous products increase the hydrochar yield decreases from 21 to 10 2 while conversion increases from 78 9 to 89 8 as the temperature rises from 230 to 260 c htc operating temperature leads to increased thermolysis fragmentation and solubilization of macromolecules in scgs resulting in a reduction in solid yield with increasing temperature 30 with the increase in reaction temperature from 260 c to 290 c the hydrochar yield declined significantly the higher decline in hydrochar yield was observed when reaction temperature was raised from 260 c to 290 c hence dependable with temperature ranges that were effective for disintegrating cellulosic amounts and considerably lignin content 31 32 this process also triggers substantial cellulose degradation under hydrothermal conditions above 210 c 33 in earlier research conversion increased rapidly as reaction temperature increased from 180 c to 280 c 34 jindal and jha 35 found that there was an increase in the total conversion of sawdust under liquefaction from 37 5 to 61 6 previous studies have demonstrated that raising reaction temperatures under subcritical circumstances improved lowers the hydrochar yield 36 37 additionally higher temperatures and pressure lowered the dielectric constant of water resulting in the water molecules losing their polarity and organic matter becoming more miscible with water molecules furthermore increasing the temperature resulted in accelerated bond fragmentation hydrolysis and repolymerization reactions resulting in reduction in hydrochar and an increment in bio oil yield 38 carbonization results in a greater amount of liquid and gaseous products at higher temperatures and a lesser amount of solid products our findings align with those published in many other articles on the liquefaction of lignocellulosic biomass 27 39 41 3 2 effect of reaction time htc is considered a slow reaction depending on the htc model the reaction time ranges from minutes to several days although reaction time effects hydrolysis reactions it only impacts them until a certain time point beyond which it has no effect htc was carried out at different reaction times ranging between 60 and 120 min while other conditions were held constant 1 1 solid to water ratio w v and 260 c reaction temperature fig 3 shows the hydrochar yield increased as time increased from 16 2 to 17 5 this may be attributed to the long reaction time responsible for the breakdown of the bio oil and supported higher gas yields and solid mass residue hence increased reaction times decreased the bio oil yield wt significantly whereas the gaseous yield and char formation were favored 42 this is predominantly triggered by network of reactions i e the re polymerization and condensation in summary the reaction time keeps a proficient role in the breakdown of the material nonetheless re polymerization and condensation reactions owing to higher processing time m typically consequences in a higher hydrochar yield 3 3 effect of solid and liquid ratio to examine the influence of biomass to water ratio the htc experiments were performed at different solid to liquid ranging in between 1 1 1 5 while other conditions were held constant reaction time 60 min and reaction temperature 260 c the result of the hydrochar and conversion are presented in fig 4 a higher yield of hydrochar was obtained at lower biomass to water ratio and a lesser hydrochar yield was obtained at higher biomass to water ratio the hydrochar yield of 17 2 was obtained at a biomass to water ratio 1 1 w v which declined to 16 5 when the biomass to water ratio fluctuated to 1 5 w v hence resembled the results of previous 43 nizamuddin et al 2016 explored the effect of biomass water ratio on palm shell via htc process the results revealed that yield of hydrochar declined marginally as biomass water ratio varied from 1 10 to 1 60 w v this lower hydrochar yield at a higher biomass to water ratio attributed to the higher biomass water ratio leading to lower carbonization 44 3 4 optimization of conversion and hydrochar 3 4 1 analysis of variance anova only 15 experimental runs were designed in the experimental process which could not instinctively acquire the optimal conditions therefore the application of response surface methodology rsm assisted in establishing the functional correlation among the targeted responses and factors along with provisions of response effect each other and optimal condition as depicted in table 4 the regression analysis results provided a higher f value of 255 7581 while the lesser p value 0 05 of 0 000017 indicates that the model items are significant besides it can be seen from fig 5 that there was a negligible deviation among the actual and predicted results i e regression coefficient r2 of 0 981 each hence the regression analysis could predict the best approximation of the yields i e conversion and hydrochar 3 4 2 response surface plots and optimization fig 6 shows the three dimensional 3d graphs for the conversion and yield obtained at different ranges of applied parameters bio char yield was negatively impacted correlated with temperature and solid to liquid ratio the hydrochar yield was reduced as the temperature and solid to liquid increased from 230 to 290 c 0 and 1 1 to 1 5 respectively the upsurge in the three parameters supported the thermal degradation and dissolution of sludge macromolecules hence decreased the solid yield higher temperature reduced the water s viscosity and assisted its rupturing into pores of hydrochar to encourage biomass breakdown 18 25 the major reduction in hydrochar yield was experienced when the reaction temperature was elevated from 260 c to 290 c in such a case the decline in hydrochar is usually observed due to the substantial collapse of hemicellulose and lignin in this temperature range and the huge total of cellulose breakdown when the temperature above 210 c 45 instead the negative correspondence among the reaction temperature and hydrochar yield was credited to certain factors for instance 1 scg contains massive content of nitrogen originating compounds proteins and protein sugar hydrolysates which are dissolved in the aqueous phase 46 and 2 the production of hydrochar is little problematic due to the thermal decay of proteins at 250 c on the other hand acetic acid is a prime organic acid formed during htc via dehydration and hydrolysis of straight chain polymers or monomers in existence with subcritical water 47 the existence of organic acids elevates the concentration of protons or hydroxide ions therefore enhancing the total ion concentration and supporting dehydration and decarboxylation 48 in addition to that the acids also boost dehydration which is the key carbonization mechanism consequently significant reduction in the oxygen content of hydrochar occurs to follow that the previous study revealed that hydrochar yield could be enhanced by reducing the reaction time 49 this behavior was attributed to the de polymerization of bio macromolecules in scg and the additional decomposition of the resulting intermediates through cleavage dehydration and decarboxylation reactions however hydrochar yield increased as the reaction time increased from 16 2 to 17 5 this may be attributed to the long reaction time incurred in the disintegration of the bio oil which ultimately favored the gas and solid residue yields another study reported resembling trends that mainly focused on reaction time s influence on l cubeba seed hence the increase in reaction times decreased the bio oil yield wt while the higher reaction time promotes the gaseous and char products 42 hence this phenomenon is primarily triggered out by re polymerization and condensation reactions in summary the reaction time offers a dominating behavior during the material breakdown however re polymerization and condensation reactions owing to higher processing time produce higher yield of hydrochar 3 5 characterization of hydrochar 3 5 1 thermal stability and oxidative reactivity of hydrochars thermogravimetric analysis tga is a recognized analytical method aimed to evaluate the combustion profile of any solid feedstock to investigate the thermal reactivity and degradation stages associated with temperature thermogravimetric tg and derivative thermogravimetric dtg curves are very helpful in determining the thermal behavior of the materials as shown in fig 7 a b decomposition was categorized into three key temperature oriented stages 0 to 150 c 250 to 350 c and 350 c onwards final temperature the initial weight loss 0 to 150 c is associated with water removal and lighter volatiles mainly with dehydration and decarboxylation reaction 25 50 the second subsequent stage characterizes the rapid breakdown of composite volatiles and considerable weight loss in the temperature range 250 to 350 c in the second stage primary degradation of biomass occurs due to the collapse of cellulose and hemicellulose 27 this process is sustained up to 550 c hence the complete decomposition of cellulose and hemicellulose and a lesser extent of lignin occurred 51 it is important to note that the dtg curves acquired for the hydrochars see fig 7b expose the three discrete peaks after water removal the first noticeable weight loss was observed from 100 to 250 c with unique peaks at about 215 5 c credited to the release of light volatile another set of noticeable peaks trails appeared between 250 and 370 c summiting about 320 10 c hence also associated with the release of volatile matters a noteworthy weight loss rate between 0 5 and 1 35 c contingent on the process conditions arose as the secondary volatile evolution for all hydrochar samples notably the hydrochar was either recovered at 200 c or after 200 c hence exhibited two phased volatile release stage the initial volatile release specifies the occurrence of short chain hydrocarbons 52 caused by the disintegration of scgs long chain polymers short chain hydrocarbon monomer production with elevating reaction temperature might elucidate why the initial releasing volatiles peaks become more obvious for hydrochars acquired at and after 200 c it also indicates that momentous breakdown of scgs lignocellulosic through the htc process activated around 200 c to conclude the final clear peak summiting around 492 20 c appeared between 370 c and 550 c which is ascribed to the char decomposition tga profile for both the samples was observed to flat curves which showed the unconverted part in the form of ash to estimate the energy consumed during the process the kinetic parameters is essential therefore usually calculated by arrhenius equation in our case the activation energy e was estimated by the non isothermal isoconversional technique using kissinger akahira sunose kas model the values of e for stage 1 stage 2 and stage 3 were calculated as 43 65 8 kj mol for stage 1 79 65 6 kj mol for stage 2 and 93 65 4 kj mol for stage 3 comparatively higher e was estimated for stage 2 primarily due to higher weight loss as shown in fig 7b 3 5 2 surface area pore diameter and pore volume analysis of hydrochars the adsorption desorption isotherms by employing n2 conferring to the bet technique for the three hydrochars are illustrated in fig 8 a c therefore the structural synergy between micropores and the mesopores can be easily seen fig 8 a c shows that the pore size dispersal of three samples was analyzed using the barrett joyner and halenda bjh method the surface area pore volume they are provided in table 5 the results demonstrate that the specific surface was significantly improved from 4 4 m2 g for scg to 16 5 m2 g for hydrochar obtained at 290 c the strengthening in surface area pore volume and pore width was accredited to the process temperature and time leading to the huge decomposition of the structure of the scg hence resulting in an upgraded structural characteristic of hydrochar i e porosity additionally fig 9 illustrates the pore size distribution of hydrochars which reveals the presence of micropores 0 4 nm mesopores 0 40 nm and macropores 40 nm and onwards in the hydrochars this shape indicates an uneven distribution of pore sizes under low relative pressure and hysteresis in desorption indicates mesopores as well as micropores in small amounts 53 the sem results have also validated an intensification in porosity and adaptation of the structure of the hydrochar after hydrothermal processing the bet surface area was perceived to be amended by rising the temperature for a reason of improved volatiles evolution which eventually intensifies the pore expansion of hydrochar 54 moreover higher temperatures destruct the walls between contiguous pores which causes pore widening in addition the reaction time in combination with reaction temperature also strongly disturbs the char s surface area moreover the longer residence time and lower temperature consequences in higher surface area 55 the upsurge in surface area ascribed to the tunneling effects of hydrothermal processing mass transfer and heating processes 30 which eroded the fiber structure of scg hence causing the creation of several pores thus increasing the bet surface area and total pore volume 56 3 5 3 structural analysis of hydrochars fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy is an established tool to detect structural alterations in chemical configurations ftir is an appropriate technique for ascertaining the structural resemblance of pure material conversely it is also utilized to scrutinize modifications in biomass after subjected to thermochemical treatment even though the biomass is heterogeneous material several peaks are usually perceived owing to bonds of organic compounds ftir investigation was focused on identifying the functional groups of the samples and recognizing the resulting alteration in the structure after htc treatment 58 as shown in fig 10 and table 6 in supplementary material the oh functional groups symbolized by transmittance peaks were detected at 3254 cm 1 for scg and 3309 cm 1 3299 cm 1 and 3305 cm 1 for different hydrochars obtained at 230 c 260 c and 290 c respectively as shown in fig 9 the scg samples had a strong peak 3500 to 3000 cm 1 compared to hydrochars which suggested that the presence of oh bonds of carboxyl groups is higher in scg than hydrochars these peaks might be accredited to moisture presence phenol or its derivatives and or alcohols 34 59 few peaks related to ch stretching of ch ch2 and ch3 were observed at 2894 cm 1 for scg and 3052 cm 1 hc 230 c 3005 cm 1 hc 260 c and 3016 hc 290 c 60 the co stretching peak for scg was observed at 1705 cm 1 for hydrochar obtained at 230 c 260 c and 290 c observed at 1651 cm 1 and 1688 and 1704 cm 1 presenting the probable existence of carboxylic acids aldehydes and ketones co stretching of scg adjacent to 1700 cm 1 was found resilient indicating a higher amount of alkyl group compounds present than hydrochars the bond at 1454 cm 1 might be consigned to ch bending vibration in methyl groups peaks in the range of 1450 1600 cm 1 analogous to cc stretching authorizing the occurrence aliphatic and alkyl aromatics 61 the variation in the peaks of scg and chars ranging from 1325 to 1450 cm 1 could be credited to the stretching of co 34 while the peaks detected at the ranges 1000 1325 cm 1 associated to oh blending and co stretching which may be allied to the co co h and coc and 62 3 5 4 chns and hhv analysis of hydrochars table 7 shows the elemental analysis proximate and higher heating and lower heating value of hydrochars produced at different conditions the results proposed that the resulting hydrochar was produced by concurrent improvement of carbon amount and elimination of oxygen content during hydrothermal treatment hence enhancing the combustion and energy characteristics of hydrochar the initial properties of hydrochar differ significantly from scg as shown in tables 7 and 1 respectively the fixed carbon significantly increased from 6 2 to 46 1 after hydrothermal processing and the volatile matter decreased from 60 6 to 51 8 this may be attributed to organic carbon converted into the furanic compounds during the htc 63 64 the initial ash content of scg was 0 30 as compared to hydrochars obtained at different temperatures which is essentially owing to the reduction in solid mass during the htc the inorganic compounds precipitate into the solid phase and soluble organic species pass into the liquid phase 65 similar results were reported by arauzo pj et al 66 table 7 shows the carbon content improved from 50 1 to 53 9 while oxygen and hydrogen contents declined from 7 2 5 3 and 40 7 38 7 respectively the boosting in carbon and declination in oxygen amounts suggested that hydrothermal processing has transformed scg into higher energy containing fuel i e comparable to brown coal 67 in general the higher oxygen amount in biomass biofuels is unfavorable since it decline the hhv and also becomes a massive cause of corrosion and thermal instability it is important to note that an increment in carbon and declination in hydrogen and oxygen amounts were mainly accredited to the reasonable effect of reaction temperature and time as well as the simultaneous deoxygenating reactions occurring during the hydrothermal process 68 kannan et al 2017a experienced a matching trend i e the carbon was augmented from 37 0 to 49 0 while the oxygen declined from 50 67 to 39 31 when the reaction time was increased from 60 to 120 min 69 another study conducted on hydrothermal treatment of fish waste reported that the quantity of carbon boosted from 27 0 to 50 0 and oxygen declined from 65 0 to 37 0 when reaction time was increased from 60 to 120 min 70 these huge variations in the results of elemental analysis after hydrothermal processing might be additionally explored and associated to fuel quality in assistance with h c and o c atomic ratios as depicted in table 7 the o c and h c ratios of hydrochar were equated with scg and coal types 71 therefore it can be established that in terms quality fuel the obtained hydrochar is as better as to different coal types moreover the h c and o c atomic ratios of hydrochar were found lower than scg signifying that the aromaticity was progressively upgraded 72 in addition the lower values of o c and h c of hydrochar than that of scg advocate that decarboxylation demethylation and dehydration reactions occurred during the hydrothermal 69 h c assessed the magnitude of these reactions and o c ratio was evaluated with conventional energy sources in general a compound with lower h c and o c atomic ratios is mainly because of the reaction temperature and reaction time during hydrothermal processing 73 on the other hand hhv is deliberated a dynamic representative of biomass and hydrochar hence decides the quantity of possessed energy 73 in our case the hhv of hydrochar was increased up to 21 2 mj kg after hydrothermal treatment in general it is perceived that the hhv of hydrochar was almost alike to brown coal and higher than some of low rank coals for instance the charcoal lignite and peat with hhv of 23 mj kg 16 3 mj kg and 13 8 20 5 mj kg respectively because the hhv of hydrochar is relative to the amount of carbon and amount of carbon is linked with reaction temperature 67 3 5 5 morphological analysis of hydrochars all samples show high porosity over the whole surface with certain heterogeneity as shown in fig 11 there was a honeycomb like structure was observed in the samples hydrochar obtained at 290 c has a merely uneven and highly porous structure with a larger pore depth than obtained in the case of other hydrochars mainly by the devastation of fibrous structures it is understandable since the key objective of the chemical activation is to eradicate the organics and terminate the links among the functional groups 74 75 which authorizes the greater value of sbet 16 5 m2 g gotten and the substantial capability of adsorption material moreover the images revealed that the surface of hydrochars is rough and has different sizes of cavities they may be regarded as channels on the surfaces of unprocessed coffee raw materials which are useful for the adsorption of pollutants 76 pores formation on the surface of hydrochar credited to the reaction time and temperature because at high reaction time highly supports the intensive breaking of cellulose and hemicellulose which results in formation the pores 77 the scg are broken down considerably at higher temperature hence consequences contact of elementary layers of biomass consequently in an enhancement in the porosity of hydrochar which is in consistent with previous study marx et al 2014 reported that the walls between contiguous pores are damaged at higher temperature triggering an expansion of pores 78 3 5 6 crystallinity analysis the crystallinity of scg and different hydrochar samples was investigated via xrd analysis as depicted in fig 12 from the xrd patterns of scg and hydrochars hc 230 c hc 260 c hc 290 c as shown in fig 11 broad peaks with 2θ at around 23 appeared on scg and all hydrochar samples suggesting the presence of an ordered graphitic structure 79 typically different representative peaks appeared at 2θ for 16 25 and 35 and around 68o which are distinctively peaks for cellulose 80 peaks were positioned between 10 and 35 2θ hence strongly endorsed to deflection of amorphous carbon 68 indicating that scg were carbonized as carbon the crystallinity peak for hydrochars appeared between 20 and 25 at 2θ specifying lesser amount of amorphous solids organic removing components and sufficient material stability the crystallinity percentage increased for hydrochar from scg an escalation in crystallinity thru hydrothermal processing could be ascribed to eliminating amorphous constituents hemicellulose and lignin present in coffee grounds 81 a study carried out by liu et al 2017 reported that an upsurge in crystallinity of hydrochar during the hydrothermal processing is accredited to hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose fraction in the amorphous region a similar study also stated that crystallinity depends on the reaction temperature therefore it decreases when the temperature increases 82 3 5 7 physicochemical properties of biochar and hydrochar and their applications different thermochemical processes operate at different process conditions hence producing different final products with different characteristics in our case the physicochemical characterization was carried for the industrial and environmental applications of biochar and hydrochar table 8 shows the characterization of biochar and hydrochar based on elemental analysis hhv and surface area analysis for both the yield of solid and h c o c ratios were reduced while the energy density was improved when the reaction time and temperature were increased it was observed that higher process temperature was the most influence parameter for controlling the product and physicochemical characteristics hhv of lignin was significantly higher than that of the hemicellulose and therefore eliminating hemicellulose from biomass would yield a product with improved lignin quantity as well as improved energy density 83 notably the breakdown of hemicellulose was observed more rapid in htc process than in slow pyrolysis mainly because of the existence of subcritical water thus as anticipated the energy density for the hydrochar was observed higher in comparison with biochar in slow pyrolysis regime 84 the discrepancies in structural and surficial characteristics of both the chars were essentially owing to the different reaction mediums used both processes i e htc and slow pyrolysis hence the different reaction mechanism as well as different compounds on the other hand the pyrolysis of biomass 400 c usually leads to larger surface areas and porous chars 85 for this reason many wood types with surface areas up to 350 m2 g after pyrolysis at 500 c 86 therefore the porosity of hydrochar has been reported to be low 87 during the htc process the raw biomass transforms to coal resembling material with upgraded physicochemical characteristics that can be employed as a substitute to coal moreover the development of hydronium ions catalyzes the collapse of hemicellulose polysaccharides causing in generation of intermediate products such as aldehydes levulinic formic acids lactic and aceticpropenoic and phenolic compounds that may possibly be employed during chemical manufacturing 4 conclusion hydrothermal carbonization htc of scg was conducted to promote energy recovery bioenergy from spent coffee grounds in this study the management of scgs through landfilling has led to a massive cost and environmental impact since it is primarily a waste biomass product by using htc we can maximize the energy density of solid fuels thereby producing a much more suitable solid fuel the optimized hydrochar yield was achieved at 290 c 90 min and 1 1 the reaction time was the least important factor observed from anova analysis the hhv of hydrochar was improved from 19 5 mj kg to 21 2 mj kg sem analysis clearly shows an increment in the number of pores on the surface of hydrochars was verified by bet analysis surface area of hydrochar was enlarged from 4 4 m2 g to 16 5 m2 g the activation energy values using kissinger akahira sunose model were estimated to 43 65 8 kj mol for stage 1 79 65 6 kj mol for stage 2 and 93 65 4 kj mol for stage 3 by considering the high calorific value essential for different commercial applications i e industry and power stations it may have a strong potential for replacing coal by itself or in co combustion with coal in residential and industrial applications declaration

12881,in this study the separation of hydrocarbon derivatives from the water surface one of the world s significant problems and challenges was solved by synthesizing a superhydrophobic and super oleophilic luffa sponge ls in an easy inexpensive and environmentally friendly way using design expert 12 software the values of graphene wax and time to absorb oil from the water surface were optimized the optimal amounts of graphene wax and time were obtained at 0 108 g 0 338 g and 2 587 minutes respectively the tga analysis showed that the modified luffa sponge was temperature decomposed between 348 1 and 394 3 c and finally decomposed and carbonized completely at 497 2 c also the modified luffa sponge s hydrophobicity was investigated by contact angle analysis the results displayed that the modified sponge s contact angle with wax and graphene was 158 which confirmed the modified luffa sponge s super hydrophobicity in addition the sorption efficiency of the modified luffa sponge was higher than 91 32 and oil water sorption capacity was larger than 11 92 g g also the average oil of recovery after 10 cycles maintains separation sorption of around 91 32 finally luffa sponge graphene carnauba and beeswax can be used as biodegradable super hydrophobic and super oleophilic sorbents in the industry graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords luffa sponge biodegradation superhydrophobic eco friendly super oleophilic 1 introduction one of the biggest problems in the world today is pollution caused by oil spills in the seas and oceans which has become a vital environmental issue worldwide these contaminants can enter seawater through various methods including direct or indirect discharges including oil extraction operations tanker transportation fuel oil and many other similar accidents 1 2 in addition because these hydrocarbons are difficult to decompose biochemically and cause significant damage to the environment and aquatic animals they must be treated in the environment before discharge therefore treatment is highly regarded for oil effluents due to the harmful risks they pose to human health the environment plants and aquatic organisms finally to prevent the extensive human and financial damage that countries may suffer in this event oil water separation methods are essential for treating oily industrial wastewater also various techniques have been developed to eliminate and recover oil spills each of which has advantages and disadvantages such as mechanical chemical physical and biological techniques 3 4 in general traditional procedures such as centrifugation membrane ultrasonic separation gravity separation photocatalysts rotation coagulation evaporation and electrochemical and biological methods are all extensively used for oil water separation 5 6 however sophisticated separation tools low separation sorption and high cost make these oil water separation systems more challenging to use for example in the method of removing oil stains by membranes membranes act selectively in this way larger particles do not pass through the membrane cavities and are practically repelled and in contrast smaller particles pass through the membrane cavities and filtration is performed the most critical factor in the industry s non commercial and unusability of this method was the required facilities and the high cost of membrane construction in addition manufactured membranes have a long life and need to be replaced 7 also the use of catalysts to separate oil was first investigated in 1986 but the remarkable point was the inability of catalysts to separate and remove oil stains on the water surface based on the ability of the catalysts oil stains would stick to each other clot or settle simply by reducing the surface load of the parts which was helpful however it needed a membrane or mechanism to remove the stains from the water again which was why catalysts were quickly removed from companies options for removing oil stains 8 so due to the drawbacks of separation methods like lesser recyclability poor selectivity high operational cost high toxicity long time requirement the introduction of secondary pollutants and inadequacy use of different sorbent materials to be a common method for oil water treatment because of low cost remediation process availability practical applications and eco friendliness 9 specially modified of the surface layers of sorbent materials a superhydrophobic super oleophilic coating was obtained that can effectively remove oil and water with the wide advantages like fast separation and high separation sorption and sorption capacity 4 in recent years the use of materials with 3 dimensional 3d porous structures has always received much attention due to high promising sorbent owing to its outstanding properties such as metal foam and meshes fabrics and textiles non biodegradable sponges pu pv pp and so on aerogel graphene etc these kinds of commercial sponges have prominent features like the subsequent recovery of oils from their pores and the ability to hold oil within their matrix 10 despite successful reports of a high percentage of oil slicks absorbed by these porous structures but the disposal of these materials has always been an environmental challenge because these materials do not decompose in the environment and burning or spilling them causes environmental pollution and wastes resources 8 11 12 one of the pioneers in removing oil stains from the water surface is synthesizing oleophilic and hydrophobic sorbents based on polyurethane this sorbent has a good performance in oil sorption the usability of the absorbed oil led to a change in the manufacture of oleophilic sorbents because this sorbent has performed well but two factors led to the non use of such sorbents in the industry the first is the high cost of producing these sorbents the second is the environmental damage that these polymer products show during prolonged exposure to sunlight and at high temperatures due to the reaction of active monomers that sometimes remain in the sorbents in contrast the use of biodegradable sorbents has received much attention as they are highly sorption capacity inexpensive not toxic provide oil reuse to industry and are safe for the environment especially aquatic animals and birds nevertheless biomass based materials with the ability to be renewable and biodegradable due to their many advantages can be used as a suitable option to solve oil spills collection 13 14 among different types of biodegradable sorbents 15 luffa cylindrica a known sponge gourd or vegetable sponge belongs to the cucurbitaceae family application for oil water purification 16 luffa sponge is a biological cell substance mainly composed of lignin hemicellulose and cellulose 17 thus luffa cylindrical is a lignocellulosic material with a continuous 3d macroporous surface with an inflexible structure resembling a polymer based sponge luffa sponge is very light and has a specific gravity of 0 92 g cm3 permeability 79 93 has a minimal bulk 30 02 0 04 g cm3 and surface space of 850 m2 m3 18 21 luffa sponges are accessible at a low cost and are commonly widespread in china japan asia and america this sponge has various applications in daily life because of its high water sorption capacity exceptional mechanical properties degradability and renewable structure and stable structure such as a filter for purification and filtration decorative materials and kitchen cleaning and fuel for cooking 17 22 also low surface energy reagents have been used in all methods of modifying luffa sponges including polyurea glue fas 17 and polydimethylsiloxane stearic acid pdms alkyl ketone dimer akd perfluorooctanoic acid these low energy chemicals are neither renewable nor biodegradable also surface hydrophobicity mostly relates to the variance in surface energy between the water droplet and the surface which can be attained via reducing the free surface energy or changing the surface roughness thus nanoparticles such as sio2 zno tio2 fe3o4 have been used to improve the surface and increase the hydrophobicity of the sponge which are not only toxic but also pollute the environment this method has been followed to remove oil from seawater by sorption oil on the surface of the ultra hydrophobic foam and thus greater sorption capacity as a result hydrophobic carbon compounds and wax can be used to create hydrophobic and oil friendly properties in the luffa sponge 23 24 bio waxes with a hydrophobic nature such as carnauba wax cw and beeswax produced by apis melifera a type of western bee can be converted to completely non toxic substances immediately after dissolution in polar solvents coatings based on these bio waxes have lower energy levels and coarser textures 25 28 these waxes can also be used to produce super hydrophobic surfaces because of their potential applications in the wood food packaging industries and paper carnauba wax includes hydrocarbons 1 3 acids 3 6 fatty alcohols 10 16 and fatty acid esters 80 85 it is around 20 esterified fatty diols 10 methoxylated or hydroxylated cinnamic acid and 6 hydroxylated fatty acids also the beeswax composition is hydrocarbons 12 16 with a predominant chain length of c27 c33 mainly heptacosane nonacosane hentriacontane pentacosane and tricosane free fatty acids 12 14 with a chain length of c24 c32 in addition carnauba wax and beeswax are composed of only one long chain fatty acid bonded to a long chain alcohol group attached due to their long nonpolar carbon chains waxes are extremely hydrophobic meaning they lack an affinity for water 29 30 these waxes are among the natural resources with low energy levels they have many advantages such as easy manufacturing abundance commerciality low cost renewable eco friendly etc nevertheless their most significant advantage is the lack of organic solvents and chemicals facilitating their industrial use 31 in a 2019 study wang et al used rice bran wax and carnauba wax as a covering and ethyl acetate as a solvent the wax layer formed the composite particle film microstructures making the superhydrophobic coating resistant to soaking in various oils and water and highly corrosive the ultra hydrophobic and ultra oleophilic luffa sponge was able to selectively separate oil from the water surface with necessary features such as reusability period 10 separation sorption 91 and high sorption capacity 9 5 g g 32 in another study in 2018 yu et al proposed the manufacture of a modified luffa sponge after cleaning the surface of the luffa sponge with naoh for 2 h to remove impurities and prepare the luffa sponge to react with the modified material the sio2 silica and water based polyurea adhesive were then combined in the organic ethanol solvent until a milky white colloidal suspension was obtained and then the luffa sponges were immersed and dried in the obtaining solution the results showed hydrophobicity oleophilic and high chemical and mechanical resistance of the modified luffa sponge 33 in another study in 2018 yinlei lin et al covered the surface of a hydrophilic luffa sponge using f sio2 nps fluorine silica nanoparticles prepared using the sol gel method the results show high hydrophobicity and a contact angle of about 156 in the modified luffa sponge which can absorb oil stains 34 among different materials used for oil water separation graphene nanosheet is emerging as a new research frontier for realizing wastewater purification 35 graphene is a two dimensional carbon material that is made by bonding carbon atoms in a repetitive hexagonal structure graphene is one of the most robust carbon materials with high conductivity and transparency due to its flat honeycomb pattern due to the chemical resistance of graphene and its exceptional physical properties it has been widely used in medicine electronics aviation water treatment and catalysis 36 graphene nanosheets also have great potential for removing oil contaminants from water due to their inherent water repellency and high specific surface area on the other hand due to the natural decomposition by microorganisms and enzymes and other biological activities a suitable option can be used to increase the hydrophobicity of the sponge surface graphene can also be used as a high porosity three dimensional hydrophobic oil friendly material such as graphene aerogels and graphene sponges which have a sorption capacity of up to several times their mass however three dimensional graphene materials have insufficient compaction capacity and thus oils and organic solvents are not easily recoverable also preparing three dimensional graphene is usually complex and expensive leading to limitations in its practical application in separating oil from water 37 39 in a study in 2018 diwakar et al proposed making a modified luffa sponge they used alkaline to remove impurities from the luffa sponge the sponge s surface was then covered with modified graphene by immersion and drying and the hydrophilicity of the sponge was changed to hydrophobicity the results showed good stability of the sponge in oil sorption 18 in this study we successfully obtained for the first time superhydrophobic and super oleophilic properties of luffa sponges with graphene nanosheet natural waxes of carnauba and beeswax on the luffa surface using an immersed technique the as synthesized sorption is reusable highly efficient eco friendly and cost effective based on the results a mechanism is suggested to describe the observed characteristics therefore our goal is to use this large scale sorbent to fabricate oil separation from aquatic areas that are environmentally friendly and cost effective 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials raw luffa fruit was obtained from farmers in golestan province in iran with the following characteristics dry fibers light brown color with a length and diameter of 30 cm and 5 cm respectively natural beeswax and carnauba wax were obtained from local stores with the following properties beeswax yellow solid waxy melting point around 64 c specific gravity 0 952 g cm3 at 25 c carnauba wax white solid waxy melting point around 80 c specific gravity 0 994 g cm3 at 25 c sodium hydroxide naoh 97 ethanol c2h5oh 99 graphene nanosheet thickness 6 8 nm were obtained from commercial sources sigma aldrich and merck deionized water was prepared from a laboratory also crude oil with a density range of around 0 98 g cm3 was supplied by the tehran refinery 2 2 preparation of sorbent 2 2 1 preparation of luffa sponge briefly first the purchased raw luffa sponges were cut into pads with dimensions of 2 5 cm 3 5 cm and thickness 3 8 cm then the alkalization process was performed to remove impurities remove fine and coarse particles and increase the surface roughness and surface preparation to increase the reaction with modifiers alkalization can remove the gummy and fatty substances hemicellulose and lignin from natural fiber hemicellulose which includes more from hexosan xylan and polyuronide has been shown to be very sensitive to sodium hydroxide however it has minimum effect on the lignin in the fibers treatment with naoh made the surface of the luffa rougher because most of the impurities such as lignin and hemicellulose in the luffa sponge were dissolved and removed 40 in addition these treatments caused the flexibility and softening of the cell walls of the fibers and the formation of nanopores between the well arranged cellulose nanofibers so the surface of luffa is ready for modification 41 first the cut pads were washed with deionized water for 20 min and then the pads were immersed in naoh solution 0 5 n at room temperature for one hour the luffa sponges were then rinsed twice more with deionized water for 10 min each for a total of 20 min and finally left at room temperature for 24 h to dry completely to ensure that the sponges were dry they were placed in an oven at 50 c for 1 h 2 2 2 preparation of oleophilic luffa sponge initially 200 ml of ethyl acetate was heated to 70 c then different amounts of total carnauba and beeswax 0 1 g 0 3 g and 0 5 g which were confirmed using design expert software were the heated solution of ethyl acetate on the stirrer was added and allowed to obtain a clear and uniform solution the solution was then moved to a water bath at a temperature of about 50 c and then the washed luffa pads were immersed in the prepared solution for 5 s and then placed at room temperature to dry immersion was repeated 3 times to ensure that the waxes spread and settled on the surfaces of the luffa sponge 42 2 2 3 preparation of hydrophobic luffa sponge fig 1 shows the schematic of synthesizing a modified luffa sponge with carnauba wax beeswax and graphene finally for the hydrophobicity of the luffa sponge obtained in the previous step different amounts of graphene nanosheets 0 15 g 0 1 g and 0 05 g were confirmed using design expert software first the graphene nanosheets dispersed in the organic ethanol solvent were placed inside an ultrasonic probe at 150 v for 30 min the luffa sponges prepared in the previous step were then immersed in graphene solutions at room temperature for 1 h and finally to dry the luffa sponges were placed in an oven at 6 c for 6 h this was repeated 3 times to ensure that the nanosheets were entirely on the surfaces of the luffa sponge 18 in this step the final modified sponge luffa graphene carnauba and beeswax was ready 2 3 characterization of raw luffa and modified luffa sponges the synthesized of the carnauba and beeswax luffa sponge graphene luffa sponge and final modified sponge were performed using fourier transform infrared ftir avatar thermo usa spectroscopy in the wavenumber range from 4000 cm 1 to 400 cm 1 the surface morphology of the raw luffa sponge carnauba and beeswax luffa sponge graphene luffa sponge and the final modified sponge was characterized via field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem mira iii czech republic moreover for identifying and confirming the composing elements and presence of different particles in the prepared nanofiber were used eds and elemental mapping fesem tescan czech republic respectively also a contact angle test was performed to measure changes in the hydrophobicity of the surface of sponges after corrections were made on its surface thermal gravimetric analysis and derivative thermal gravimetric were used to evaluate the temperature resistance tga q600 usa and the rate of material weight upon heating dtg q600 usa respectively 2 4 sorption of oil stains using modified luffa sponge raw luffa sponges modified with graphene nanosheet carnauba and beeswax in a container of 500 cm3 containing 3 5 by mass nacl and 10 g of crude oil with a density of 0 98 g cm3 were immersed also to study and improve the effect of wax graphene concentration and temperature on oil uptake from the water surface by the final modified sponge the response technique and central composite design ccd were used the nano sponge pieces were placed in a container containing seawater and oil after a specific time they were taken out of the water and their mass was measured the following equation calculated the oil water sorption capacity g g by luffa sponges 1 k c m b m a m a in this equation ma is the mass of the primary luffa sponge and mb is the mass of the sponges after being saturated with oil stains the following equation calculated the oil water separation sorption by luffa sponges 2 k s 1 m b m a 100 in this equation ma is the mass of the primary luffa sponge and mb is the mass of the sponges saturated with oil stains the following equation calculated the oil water recyclability of the modified luffa sponge 3 k r 1 m b m a 100 where ma displays the mass of modified luffa after oil sorption and mb displays the mass of modified luffa after centrifugation all recycling experiments were done 3 times and the average value was reported 43 moreover for removing oil stains absorbed by luffa sponges recover the luffa sponge through a centrifuge at 3500 rpm for 5 min 2 5 optimization of luffa sponge according to study sources time wax and graphene concentrations are essential parameters in the rate of oil sorption by the luffa sponge so the experiments were designed based on these three variables tables 1 and 2 show the levels of variables affecting oil sorption respectively to predict the desired conditions the experimental values were investigated using design expert 12 software and adapted based on the second order polynomial regression model 4 y β 0 β i x i β ij x ij β ii x i 2 all tests were done in 3 replications analysis of variance anova was done to assess the significance of each response in the model to confirm the suitability of the models extra tests were performed according to the optimal conditions predicted by response surface method rsm and the gained information was compared with the values predicted through the model 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of luffa and modified luffa sponges 3 1 1 ftir analysis fig 2 demonstrates the ftir spectra of raw luffa sponge wax graphene and modified luffa sponge by wax and graphene according to the results the bands in the raw luffa ftir at 3285 04 cm 1 and 2849 77 cm 1 are related to the tensile vibration the hydroxyl group oh and ch in cellulose respectively the band of 1591 84 cm 1 also indicates the tensile vibration of carbonyl c o in the acetyl group related to hemicellulose and the aldehyde group in lignin the band 1012 58 cm 1 corresponds to the strong tensile vibration of co in cellulose and the band 708 82 cm 1 belongs to the cc group the bands related to cellulose lignin and hemicellulose confirm the hydrophilicity of the sponge surface 44 also in the wax ftir the band of 1736 93 cm 1 shows the tensile vibration of the carbonyl group c o bond which is because of carboxylic acid ester and ketone groups in typical waxes in addition bands 1467 1172 and 723 cm 1 are associated with the asymmetric tensile vibration of the ch2 and ch3 bonds the symmetrical tensile vibration of the coo group and the long carbon chain respectively 32 45 46 in addition the ftir spectra of graphene show the band at 1580 cm 1 associated with the characteristic band of the c6h6 bond also the band at 1384 cm 1 was attributed to the ch3 bending vibration the band at 3438 cm 1 was referred to as the characteristic band of oh 47 furthermore the bands at 2922 and 2853 cm 1 were related to the stretching and vibrations of ch3 and ch2 respectively also after modifications to the luffa sponge s surface including hydrophobic and oleophilic the existing bands were not much different from the raw sponge bands duo to the chemical reaction between the surface of the sponge with the wax and graphene did not occur and only the intensity of the bands changed in some places in addition the intensive bands of 2915 46 and 2847 27 cm 1 are associated with the symmetrical tensile vibrations of the methylene ch2 group in natural wax 32 3 1 2 sem analysis fig 3 displays the sem images of the luffa sponge before and after modification in different stages which shows the successful changes in each stage according to fig 3a before making any changes alkalinization hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity the luffa skeleton has a relatively irregular surface with shallow channels and relatively few wrinkles also the average diameter of raw luffa fibers determined by image j analysis was 1 45 0 78 μm according to fig 3b after washing and alkannin the surface of the luffa sponge using naoh the changes are more palpable eventually alkalinization causes dissolve or remove low molecular mass impurities reduce the microfibril angle of rotation of the fiber material making the surface rough and forming many cavities improving the ability of the fiber to react with modification reagent in addition alkali modification caused fibrillation of the fibers which decreased the size of the fiber bundle increased the length to diameter ratio and effectively enlarged the contact area with the modifier the alkali pretreatment dissolved some concomitant amorphous materials such as lignin hemicellulose and pectin which were embedded in the crystalline region during the growth period imperfectly crystallization of the fiber materials and changes in the characteristics of the surface topography after pretreatment of the fiber the fibers expanded in the alkali solution resulting in a weaker interfacial interaction between the fibrils and the intermediate cavity and fiber wall thickness increased after alkali treatment some channels appear and the luffa surface is more irregular because a large amount of the surface material was removed finally the average diameter of alkanization luffa fibers determined by image j analysis was 1 49 0 98 μm also according to fig 3c and d by adding the optimum amount of carnauba beeswax and graphene nanosheets respectively many wrinkles are covered which is naturally more than the amount of coverage in the final modified luffa sponge fig 3f in addition the average diameter of luffa carnauba and beeswax luffa graphene and modified luffa fibers determined by image j analysis were 1 54 1 87 μm 3 81 1 84 μm and 3 22 2 45 μm respectively therefore it can be concluded that almost all cavities holes and wrinkles on the luffa surface are covered with corrective materials and the corrections have been done correctly modified luffa sponge with graphene nanosheets created some important changes in the morphology of luffa fibers the results showed the size distribution of nanofibers compared to raw luffa fibers broadened the result of this change because of low interaction between luffa fibers and graphene nanosheet the majority of the graphene nanosheets agglomerated on the fibers and formed some larger nanofibers it could be observed that the surface appearance of luffa sponge graphene carnauba and beeswax is non uniform with large graphene nanosheets agglomeration sites it is noteworthy that the low tendency of graphene nanosheets to luffa sponges barred their localization inside the nanofibers 48 3 1 3 eds analysis fig 1s a shows the surface of the luffa sponge according to the figure no sediment is found and the luffa s smooth surface indicates the absence of layers of any foreign matter on its surface also fig 1s b shows the eds spectrum of raw luffa sponge according to the results a strong carbon signal is confirmed in the structure of this plant material the structure of raw luffa sponge consists of carbon and weak signals of o and n derived from surface bound biological molecules according to the diagram carbon peaks appear at approximately 0 5 kev which is surrounded in the luffa sponge structure by a thin layer of some organic matter due to the vegetation of the luffa sponge and its cellulosic structure the presence of carbon and oxygen is expected however the presence of n and its small peak relative to oxygen speculation increases that the structure of the luffa sponge is chitinous the diagram also shows that al has a higher value than the other elements found in addition the presence of calcium is due to the vegetation of the luffa sponge because calcium is an essential component for strengthening plants which is found in abundance fig 1s j shows the morphological composition of the elements of the empty luffa sponge based on its constituent elements according to the results this type of scattering indicates the structure of a luffa sponge fabric in which all the elements o c n na ca al s are evenly distributed on its surface and there is no accumulation this indicates the absence of external elements other than the elements that make up the raw luffa sponge fig 1s c j also confirm the presence of elements o c n na ca al s in the luffa sponge according to fig 2s a sediments appeared on the luffa s surface and tubular structures and coarse and fine spherical particles appeared on the surface of the luffa also fig 2s b displays the constituent elements of the modified luffa sponge are n c ka o s na and al according to the diagram si is also added to the luffa sponge compounds in addition their concentration has increased due to the increase of some element peaks the increase in carbon level from 1120 to 3200 indicates that it has been added almost three times to its concentration in a modified luffa sponge also the chart shows that the final modified luffa sponge has more calcium because calcium is of natural origin and is found in abundance in natural materials including those used to modify the properties of luffa moreover fig 2s k shows the elements present on the surface of the modified luffa sponge according to the images the presence of elements o si n na ca al c s on the modified luffa sponge is confirmed 3 2 contact angle fig 4a displays the water contact angle for the improved luffa sponge according to the results it is about 158 which indicates that the changes have been applied correctly and the modified luffa sponge is entirely hydrophobic in addition when oil droplets settle on the modified luffa sponge s surface they are rapidly absorbed contact angle 30 indicating an utterly oleophilic surface of the modified luffa sponge fig 4b in a 2017 study zhe wang et al used polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane poss to modify the surface of a raw luffa sponge to make it hydrophobic and oleophilic the analysis results show a contact angle of 155 with selective and high removal of oil stains 49 3 3 tga dtg analysis tga analysis is a way to study and discover how a substance behaves in the face of heat fig 5a and b show the thermogravimetric analysis tga of raw luffa and modified luffa sponge respectively according to the tga analysis raw luffa sponge lost some mass just before 100 c because it contains moisture also the results demonstrate that this sponge was in a normal constant temperature phase from 100 to 278 1 c and underwent temperature decomposition between 278 1 and 339 1 c then decomposed completely at 436 6 c eventually the mineral elements remained in other words they carbonized however the tga test of the modified luffa sponge fig 5b shows an increase in the product s temperature resistance according to the diagram the modified luffa sponge does not have moisture so it does not have a mass loss of empty luffa up to 100 c also the modified luffa sponge has a natural constant temperature phase from 0 to 348 1 c and is subjected to temperature decomposition between 348 1 and 394 3 c and is fully decomposed and carbonized at 497 2 c also the dtg results showed thermal decomposition of the modified luffa sponge slowed down at high temperatures and prolonged the time of thermal decomposition in 2021 yang et al created a three dimensional ultralight sponge using electro spun polyacrylonitrile pan nanofibers and natural luffa sponge pan nanofibers and luffa fibers were dispersed in an aqueous solution using polyvinyl alcohol pva and a three dimensional ultralight sponge was formed using frees drying technology they also added a spider web structure to the synthesized material to increase oil sorption the results of tga analysis clearly showed that two stages of mass loss occurred in two different temperature zones in the first stage the partial mass loss was about 100 c due to reducing the aqueous fraction also with increasing the amount of luffa sponge the structure of the sponge became more stable and its decomposition became more complex which was due to the increase in the number of hydrogen bonds in the sponge in addition as the hydrogen bonds decreased the sponge lost its stable structure and began to degrade rapidly 50 in a report presented in 2019 mingguang yu et al examined the effect of fe3o4 modified nanofibers on oil water separation the results of tga analysis showed that both fabrics of raw cotton and cotton modified with fe3o4 nanoparticles with diverse amounts of ferric chloride and iron chloride started to decompose at temperatures up to 300 c these observations displayed that the modification of the cotton surface with fe3o4 nanoparticles did not destroy the chemical structure of raw cotton fabrics 51 3 4 optimization of sorption behavior of modified luffa sponge the final modified sponge s oil water separation sorption was studied using the response technique and central composite design ccd three parameters of graphene concentration a wax concentration b and time c were measured to improve the percentage of removal r table 1s the important effect of each factor curving and contact between them on response was considered by the software of design experts according to table 2s the values gained for the parameters of p value ab ac and bc are more than 0 05 and it appears that these three factors don t have any important effect on the response and should be removed table 4s also the p value of other parameters was fewer than 0 05 and there is no need to eliminate them thus the gained equation for the response level r was calculated based on the eq 5 5 r 2 32614 868 353 a 201 634 b 6 693 c 4032 364 a 2 299 648 b 2 1 232 c 2 fig 3s a represents a contour plot and three dimensional diagram of the calculated response surface from the communication between graphene and wax concentration while keeping time at zero levels according to the results with rising graphene and wax concentration up to 0 102 g and 0 31 g respectively the removal percentage has increased up to 81 fig 3s b displays the effect of graphene concentration and time on the removal percentage keeping wax concentration at zero levels the graph demonstrates that the maximum removal percentage 82 happened at a graphene concentration of 0 1 g and a time of 3 12 min which confirms the model an interaction between the remaining two parameters wax concentration and time fig 3s c differed slightly from the earlier responses when a usual possibility residuals plot was created a selection was made for the regularity supposition which was acceptable since closely all the residuals fell almost along a straight line fig 3s d since the nearer the r2 value is to 1 0 the more reliable the model predicts the response the r2 gained here displays that the model has a good predictive ability thus from the fig 3s analysis and the responses attained in practice the optimum method conditions were graphene concentration 0 108 g wax concentration 0 338 g and time 2 587 min in addition based on the anova results the standard deviation was obtained 1 42 3 5 sorption of oil stains using final modified luffa sponge first the uncoated and final coated sponges were weighed before immersion in water and oil solution and after immersion they were removed for less than 5 min and then weighed again finally eq 1 calculated the amount of crude oil water sorption capacity eq 2 calculated the amount of crude oil water separation sorption and eq 3 calculated the amount of recycle crude oil water separation sorption table 1 displays the sponge mass before and after soaking also according to fig 6 the coated sponge s sorption capacity and separation sorption are higher than the uncoated sponge which confirms the oleophilic and hydrophobicity of the modified luffa sponge in addition according to fig 7 the percentage of separation sorption during 10 cycles almost has been the same but after the 11th cycle the percentage of separation sorption has decreased dramatically it is due to the reduction of oleophilic effects and properties of sorbent also fig 8 shows the coated floating sponge on the water oil s surface because graphene is hydrophobic and does not allow water to pass through it and reach the fiber in addition it absorbs a large amount of oil on the surface so the modified luffa sponge s hydrophobicity and oleophilic were proven in 2018 diwakar et al investigated the effect of a graphene modified luffa and raw luffa sponge on oil sorption rate from the water surface the results showed that the sorption rates of treated sponges and raw sponges were 4 735 g and 2 533 g respectively doubling the oil uptake by graphene modified luffa sponge is clear evidence of increased oil uptake 18 finally some foam sorbents sorption capacity or separation sorption has been reported in table 2 the results for some sorbents like melamine and polyurethane sponge were higher than the present work however the luffa sponge was modified by graphene nanosheets and natural waxes due to cost effectiveness ecofriendly and accessibility also the most critical point is the biodegradability of this sorbent 4 conclusion recently the use of biodegradable nano sorbents to collect oil pollution has received much attention this study investigated the performance of a biodegradable final modified sponge which was synthesized by simple dip coating technology for sorption of crude oil stains from oil water pollution in this study ftir sem and eds analyzes were used to investigate the morphological properties of the synthesized nano sorbents also tga analysis showed that the final modified luffa sponge has a higher temperature resistance than the raw luffa sponge in addition the contact angle for the modified sponge was 158 which confirmed that the final modified sponge was superhydrophobic examination of the sorption performance of the final modified sponge showed oil water separation sorption above 91 32 and sorption capacity above 11 92 g g and can be reused for up to 10 cycles the synthesized nano sorbent can be used in oil projects as a highly efficient alternative

12881,in this study the separation of hydrocarbon derivatives from the water surface one of the world s significant problems and challenges was solved by synthesizing a superhydrophobic and super oleophilic luffa sponge ls in an easy inexpensive and environmentally friendly way using design expert 12 software the values of graphene wax and time to absorb oil from the water surface were optimized the optimal amounts of graphene wax and time were obtained at 0 108 g 0 338 g and 2 587 minutes respectively the tga analysis showed that the modified luffa sponge was temperature decomposed between 348 1 and 394 3 c and finally decomposed and carbonized completely at 497 2 c also the modified luffa sponge s hydrophobicity was investigated by contact angle analysis the results displayed that the modified sponge s contact angle with wax and graphene was 158 which confirmed the modified luffa sponge s super hydrophobicity in addition the sorption efficiency of the modified luffa sponge was higher than 91 32 and oil water sorption capacity was larger than 11 92 g g also the average oil of recovery after 10 cycles maintains separation sorption of around 91 32 finally luffa sponge graphene carnauba and beeswax can be used as biodegradable super hydrophobic and super oleophilic sorbents in the industry graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords luffa sponge biodegradation superhydrophobic eco friendly super oleophilic 1 introduction one of the biggest problems in the world today is pollution caused by oil spills in the seas and oceans which has become a vital environmental issue worldwide these contaminants can enter seawater through various methods including direct or indirect discharges including oil extraction operations tanker transportation fuel oil and many other similar accidents 1 2 in addition because these hydrocarbons are difficult to decompose biochemically and cause significant damage to the environment and aquatic animals they must be treated in the environment before discharge therefore treatment is highly regarded for oil effluents due to the harmful risks they pose to human health the environment plants and aquatic organisms finally to prevent the extensive human and financial damage that countries may suffer in this event oil water separation methods are essential for treating oily industrial wastewater also various techniques have been developed to eliminate and recover oil spills each of which has advantages and disadvantages such as mechanical chemical physical and biological techniques 3 4 in general traditional procedures such as centrifugation membrane ultrasonic separation gravity separation photocatalysts rotation coagulation evaporation and electrochemical and biological methods are all extensively used for oil water separation 5 6 however sophisticated separation tools low separation sorption and high cost make these oil water separation systems more challenging to use for example in the method of removing oil stains by membranes membranes act selectively in this way larger particles do not pass through the membrane cavities and are practically repelled and in contrast smaller particles pass through the membrane cavities and filtration is performed the most critical factor in the industry s non commercial and unusability of this method was the required facilities and the high cost of membrane construction in addition manufactured membranes have a long life and need to be replaced 7 also the use of catalysts to separate oil was first investigated in 1986 but the remarkable point was the inability of catalysts to separate and remove oil stains on the water surface based on the ability of the catalysts oil stains would stick to each other clot or settle simply by reducing the surface load of the parts which was helpful however it needed a membrane or mechanism to remove the stains from the water again which was why catalysts were quickly removed from companies options for removing oil stains 8 so due to the drawbacks of separation methods like lesser recyclability poor selectivity high operational cost high toxicity long time requirement the introduction of secondary pollutants and inadequacy use of different sorbent materials to be a common method for oil water treatment because of low cost remediation process availability practical applications and eco friendliness 9 specially modified of the surface layers of sorbent materials a superhydrophobic super oleophilic coating was obtained that can effectively remove oil and water with the wide advantages like fast separation and high separation sorption and sorption capacity 4 in recent years the use of materials with 3 dimensional 3d porous structures has always received much attention due to high promising sorbent owing to its outstanding properties such as metal foam and meshes fabrics and textiles non biodegradable sponges pu pv pp and so on aerogel graphene etc these kinds of commercial sponges have prominent features like the subsequent recovery of oils from their pores and the ability to hold oil within their matrix 10 despite successful reports of a high percentage of oil slicks absorbed by these porous structures but the disposal of these materials has always been an environmental challenge because these materials do not decompose in the environment and burning or spilling them causes environmental pollution and wastes resources 8 11 12 one of the pioneers in removing oil stains from the water surface is synthesizing oleophilic and hydrophobic sorbents based on polyurethane this sorbent has a good performance in oil sorption the usability of the absorbed oil led to a change in the manufacture of oleophilic sorbents because this sorbent has performed well but two factors led to the non use of such sorbents in the industry the first is the high cost of producing these sorbents the second is the environmental damage that these polymer products show during prolonged exposure to sunlight and at high temperatures due to the reaction of active monomers that sometimes remain in the sorbents in contrast the use of biodegradable sorbents has received much attention as they are highly sorption capacity inexpensive not toxic provide oil reuse to industry and are safe for the environment especially aquatic animals and birds nevertheless biomass based materials with the ability to be renewable and biodegradable due to their many advantages can be used as a suitable option to solve oil spills collection 13 14 among different types of biodegradable sorbents 15 luffa cylindrica a known sponge gourd or vegetable sponge belongs to the cucurbitaceae family application for oil water purification 16 luffa sponge is a biological cell substance mainly composed of lignin hemicellulose and cellulose 17 thus luffa cylindrical is a lignocellulosic material with a continuous 3d macroporous surface with an inflexible structure resembling a polymer based sponge luffa sponge is very light and has a specific gravity of 0 92 g cm3 permeability 79 93 has a minimal bulk 30 02 0 04 g cm3 and surface space of 850 m2 m3 18 21 luffa sponges are accessible at a low cost and are commonly widespread in china japan asia and america this sponge has various applications in daily life because of its high water sorption capacity exceptional mechanical properties degradability and renewable structure and stable structure such as a filter for purification and filtration decorative materials and kitchen cleaning and fuel for cooking 17 22 also low surface energy reagents have been used in all methods of modifying luffa sponges including polyurea glue fas 17 and polydimethylsiloxane stearic acid pdms alkyl ketone dimer akd perfluorooctanoic acid these low energy chemicals are neither renewable nor biodegradable also surface hydrophobicity mostly relates to the variance in surface energy between the water droplet and the surface which can be attained via reducing the free surface energy or changing the surface roughness thus nanoparticles such as sio2 zno tio2 fe3o4 have been used to improve the surface and increase the hydrophobicity of the sponge which are not only toxic but also pollute the environment this method has been followed to remove oil from seawater by sorption oil on the surface of the ultra hydrophobic foam and thus greater sorption capacity as a result hydrophobic carbon compounds and wax can be used to create hydrophobic and oil friendly properties in the luffa sponge 23 24 bio waxes with a hydrophobic nature such as carnauba wax cw and beeswax produced by apis melifera a type of western bee can be converted to completely non toxic substances immediately after dissolution in polar solvents coatings based on these bio waxes have lower energy levels and coarser textures 25 28 these waxes can also be used to produce super hydrophobic surfaces because of their potential applications in the wood food packaging industries and paper carnauba wax includes hydrocarbons 1 3 acids 3 6 fatty alcohols 10 16 and fatty acid esters 80 85 it is around 20 esterified fatty diols 10 methoxylated or hydroxylated cinnamic acid and 6 hydroxylated fatty acids also the beeswax composition is hydrocarbons 12 16 with a predominant chain length of c27 c33 mainly heptacosane nonacosane hentriacontane pentacosane and tricosane free fatty acids 12 14 with a chain length of c24 c32 in addition carnauba wax and beeswax are composed of only one long chain fatty acid bonded to a long chain alcohol group attached due to their long nonpolar carbon chains waxes are extremely hydrophobic meaning they lack an affinity for water 29 30 these waxes are among the natural resources with low energy levels they have many advantages such as easy manufacturing abundance commerciality low cost renewable eco friendly etc nevertheless their most significant advantage is the lack of organic solvents and chemicals facilitating their industrial use 31 in a 2019 study wang et al used rice bran wax and carnauba wax as a covering and ethyl acetate as a solvent the wax layer formed the composite particle film microstructures making the superhydrophobic coating resistant to soaking in various oils and water and highly corrosive the ultra hydrophobic and ultra oleophilic luffa sponge was able to selectively separate oil from the water surface with necessary features such as reusability period 10 separation sorption 91 and high sorption capacity 9 5 g g 32 in another study in 2018 yu et al proposed the manufacture of a modified luffa sponge after cleaning the surface of the luffa sponge with naoh for 2 h to remove impurities and prepare the luffa sponge to react with the modified material the sio2 silica and water based polyurea adhesive were then combined in the organic ethanol solvent until a milky white colloidal suspension was obtained and then the luffa sponges were immersed and dried in the obtaining solution the results showed hydrophobicity oleophilic and high chemical and mechanical resistance of the modified luffa sponge 33 in another study in 2018 yinlei lin et al covered the surface of a hydrophilic luffa sponge using f sio2 nps fluorine silica nanoparticles prepared using the sol gel method the results show high hydrophobicity and a contact angle of about 156 in the modified luffa sponge which can absorb oil stains 34 among different materials used for oil water separation graphene nanosheet is emerging as a new research frontier for realizing wastewater purification 35 graphene is a two dimensional carbon material that is made by bonding carbon atoms in a repetitive hexagonal structure graphene is one of the most robust carbon materials with high conductivity and transparency due to its flat honeycomb pattern due to the chemical resistance of graphene and its exceptional physical properties it has been widely used in medicine electronics aviation water treatment and catalysis 36 graphene nanosheets also have great potential for removing oil contaminants from water due to their inherent water repellency and high specific surface area on the other hand due to the natural decomposition by microorganisms and enzymes and other biological activities a suitable option can be used to increase the hydrophobicity of the sponge surface graphene can also be used as a high porosity three dimensional hydrophobic oil friendly material such as graphene aerogels and graphene sponges which have a sorption capacity of up to several times their mass however three dimensional graphene materials have insufficient compaction capacity and thus oils and organic solvents are not easily recoverable also preparing three dimensional graphene is usually complex and expensive leading to limitations in its practical application in separating oil from water 37 39 in a study in 2018 diwakar et al proposed making a modified luffa sponge they used alkaline to remove impurities from the luffa sponge the sponge s surface was then covered with modified graphene by immersion and drying and the hydrophilicity of the sponge was changed to hydrophobicity the results showed good stability of the sponge in oil sorption 18 in this study we successfully obtained for the first time superhydrophobic and super oleophilic properties of luffa sponges with graphene nanosheet natural waxes of carnauba and beeswax on the luffa surface using an immersed technique the as synthesized sorption is reusable highly efficient eco friendly and cost effective based on the results a mechanism is suggested to describe the observed characteristics therefore our goal is to use this large scale sorbent to fabricate oil separation from aquatic areas that are environmentally friendly and cost effective 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials raw luffa fruit was obtained from farmers in golestan province in iran with the following characteristics dry fibers light brown color with a length and diameter of 30 cm and 5 cm respectively natural beeswax and carnauba wax were obtained from local stores with the following properties beeswax yellow solid waxy melting point around 64 c specific gravity 0 952 g cm3 at 25 c carnauba wax white solid waxy melting point around 80 c specific gravity 0 994 g cm3 at 25 c sodium hydroxide naoh 97 ethanol c2h5oh 99 graphene nanosheet thickness 6 8 nm were obtained from commercial sources sigma aldrich and merck deionized water was prepared from a laboratory also crude oil with a density range of around 0 98 g cm3 was supplied by the tehran refinery 2 2 preparation of sorbent 2 2 1 preparation of luffa sponge briefly first the purchased raw luffa sponges were cut into pads with dimensions of 2 5 cm 3 5 cm and thickness 3 8 cm then the alkalization process was performed to remove impurities remove fine and coarse particles and increase the surface roughness and surface preparation to increase the reaction with modifiers alkalization can remove the gummy and fatty substances hemicellulose and lignin from natural fiber hemicellulose which includes more from hexosan xylan and polyuronide has been shown to be very sensitive to sodium hydroxide however it has minimum effect on the lignin in the fibers treatment with naoh made the surface of the luffa rougher because most of the impurities such as lignin and hemicellulose in the luffa sponge were dissolved and removed 40 in addition these treatments caused the flexibility and softening of the cell walls of the fibers and the formation of nanopores between the well arranged cellulose nanofibers so the surface of luffa is ready for modification 41 first the cut pads were washed with deionized water for 20 min and then the pads were immersed in naoh solution 0 5 n at room temperature for one hour the luffa sponges were then rinsed twice more with deionized water for 10 min each for a total of 20 min and finally left at room temperature for 24 h to dry completely to ensure that the sponges were dry they were placed in an oven at 50 c for 1 h 2 2 2 preparation of oleophilic luffa sponge initially 200 ml of ethyl acetate was heated to 70 c then different amounts of total carnauba and beeswax 0 1 g 0 3 g and 0 5 g which were confirmed using design expert software were the heated solution of ethyl acetate on the stirrer was added and allowed to obtain a clear and uniform solution the solution was then moved to a water bath at a temperature of about 50 c and then the washed luffa pads were immersed in the prepared solution for 5 s and then placed at room temperature to dry immersion was repeated 3 times to ensure that the waxes spread and settled on the surfaces of the luffa sponge 42 2 2 3 preparation of hydrophobic luffa sponge fig 1 shows the schematic of synthesizing a modified luffa sponge with carnauba wax beeswax and graphene finally for the hydrophobicity of the luffa sponge obtained in the previous step different amounts of graphene nanosheets 0 15 g 0 1 g and 0 05 g were confirmed using design expert software first the graphene nanosheets dispersed in the organic ethanol solvent were placed inside an ultrasonic probe at 150 v for 30 min the luffa sponges prepared in the previous step were then immersed in graphene solutions at room temperature for 1 h and finally to dry the luffa sponges were placed in an oven at 6 c for 6 h this was repeated 3 times to ensure that the nanosheets were entirely on the surfaces of the luffa sponge 18 in this step the final modified sponge luffa graphene carnauba and beeswax was ready 2 3 characterization of raw luffa and modified luffa sponges the synthesized of the carnauba and beeswax luffa sponge graphene luffa sponge and final modified sponge were performed using fourier transform infrared ftir avatar thermo usa spectroscopy in the wavenumber range from 4000 cm 1 to 400 cm 1 the surface morphology of the raw luffa sponge carnauba and beeswax luffa sponge graphene luffa sponge and the final modified sponge was characterized via field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem mira iii czech republic moreover for identifying and confirming the composing elements and presence of different particles in the prepared nanofiber were used eds and elemental mapping fesem tescan czech republic respectively also a contact angle test was performed to measure changes in the hydrophobicity of the surface of sponges after corrections were made on its surface thermal gravimetric analysis and derivative thermal gravimetric were used to evaluate the temperature resistance tga q600 usa and the rate of material weight upon heating dtg q600 usa respectively 2 4 sorption of oil stains using modified luffa sponge raw luffa sponges modified with graphene nanosheet carnauba and beeswax in a container of 500 cm3 containing 3 5 by mass nacl and 10 g of crude oil with a density of 0 98 g cm3 were immersed also to study and improve the effect of wax graphene concentration and temperature on oil uptake from the water surface by the final modified sponge the response technique and central composite design ccd were used the nano sponge pieces were placed in a container containing seawater and oil after a specific time they were taken out of the water and their mass was measured the following equation calculated the oil water sorption capacity g g by luffa sponges 1 k c m b m a m a in this equation ma is the mass of the primary luffa sponge and mb is the mass of the sponges after being saturated with oil stains the following equation calculated the oil water separation sorption by luffa sponges 2 k s 1 m b m a 100 in this equation ma is the mass of the primary luffa sponge and mb is the mass of the sponges saturated with oil stains the following equation calculated the oil water recyclability of the modified luffa sponge 3 k r 1 m b m a 100 where ma displays the mass of modified luffa after oil sorption and mb displays the mass of modified luffa after centrifugation all recycling experiments were done 3 times and the average value was reported 43 moreover for removing oil stains absorbed by luffa sponges recover the luffa sponge through a centrifuge at 3500 rpm for 5 min 2 5 optimization of luffa sponge according to study sources time wax and graphene concentrations are essential parameters in the rate of oil sorption by the luffa sponge so the experiments were designed based on these three variables tables 1 and 2 show the levels of variables affecting oil sorption respectively to predict the desired conditions the experimental values were investigated using design expert 12 software and adapted based on the second order polynomial regression model 4 y β 0 β i x i β ij x ij β ii x i 2 all tests were done in 3 replications analysis of variance anova was done to assess the significance of each response in the model to confirm the suitability of the models extra tests were performed according to the optimal conditions predicted by response surface method rsm and the gained information was compared with the values predicted through the model 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of luffa and modified luffa sponges 3 1 1 ftir analysis fig 2 demonstrates the ftir spectra of raw luffa sponge wax graphene and modified luffa sponge by wax and graphene according to the results the bands in the raw luffa ftir at 3285 04 cm 1 and 2849 77 cm 1 are related to the tensile vibration the hydroxyl group oh and ch in cellulose respectively the band of 1591 84 cm 1 also indicates the tensile vibration of carbonyl c o in the acetyl group related to hemicellulose and the aldehyde group in lignin the band 1012 58 cm 1 corresponds to the strong tensile vibration of co in cellulose and the band 708 82 cm 1 belongs to the cc group the bands related to cellulose lignin and hemicellulose confirm the hydrophilicity of the sponge surface 44 also in the wax ftir the band of 1736 93 cm 1 shows the tensile vibration of the carbonyl group c o bond which is because of carboxylic acid ester and ketone groups in typical waxes in addition bands 1467 1172 and 723 cm 1 are associated with the asymmetric tensile vibration of the ch2 and ch3 bonds the symmetrical tensile vibration of the coo group and the long carbon chain respectively 32 45 46 in addition the ftir spectra of graphene show the band at 1580 cm 1 associated with the characteristic band of the c6h6 bond also the band at 1384 cm 1 was attributed to the ch3 bending vibration the band at 3438 cm 1 was referred to as the characteristic band of oh 47 furthermore the bands at 2922 and 2853 cm 1 were related to the stretching and vibrations of ch3 and ch2 respectively also after modifications to the luffa sponge s surface including hydrophobic and oleophilic the existing bands were not much different from the raw sponge bands duo to the chemical reaction between the surface of the sponge with the wax and graphene did not occur and only the intensity of the bands changed in some places in addition the intensive bands of 2915 46 and 2847 27 cm 1 are associated with the symmetrical tensile vibrations of the methylene ch2 group in natural wax 32 3 1 2 sem analysis fig 3 displays the sem images of the luffa sponge before and after modification in different stages which shows the successful changes in each stage according to fig 3a before making any changes alkalinization hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity the luffa skeleton has a relatively irregular surface with shallow channels and relatively few wrinkles also the average diameter of raw luffa fibers determined by image j analysis was 1 45 0 78 μm according to fig 3b after washing and alkannin the surface of the luffa sponge using naoh the changes are more palpable eventually alkalinization causes dissolve or remove low molecular mass impurities reduce the microfibril angle of rotation of the fiber material making the surface rough and forming many cavities improving the ability of the fiber to react with modification reagent in addition alkali modification caused fibrillation of the fibers which decreased the size of the fiber bundle increased the length to diameter ratio and effectively enlarged the contact area with the modifier the alkali pretreatment dissolved some concomitant amorphous materials such as lignin hemicellulose and pectin which were embedded in the crystalline region during the growth period imperfectly crystallization of the fiber materials and changes in the characteristics of the surface topography after pretreatment of the fiber the fibers expanded in the alkali solution resulting in a weaker interfacial interaction between the fibrils and the intermediate cavity and fiber wall thickness increased after alkali treatment some channels appear and the luffa surface is more irregular because a large amount of the surface material was removed finally the average diameter of alkanization luffa fibers determined by image j analysis was 1 49 0 98 μm also according to fig 3c and d by adding the optimum amount of carnauba beeswax and graphene nanosheets respectively many wrinkles are covered which is naturally more than the amount of coverage in the final modified luffa sponge fig 3f in addition the average diameter of luffa carnauba and beeswax luffa graphene and modified luffa fibers determined by image j analysis were 1 54 1 87 μm 3 81 1 84 μm and 3 22 2 45 μm respectively therefore it can be concluded that almost all cavities holes and wrinkles on the luffa surface are covered with corrective materials and the corrections have been done correctly modified luffa sponge with graphene nanosheets created some important changes in the morphology of luffa fibers the results showed the size distribution of nanofibers compared to raw luffa fibers broadened the result of this change because of low interaction between luffa fibers and graphene nanosheet the majority of the graphene nanosheets agglomerated on the fibers and formed some larger nanofibers it could be observed that the surface appearance of luffa sponge graphene carnauba and beeswax is non uniform with large graphene nanosheets agglomeration sites it is noteworthy that the low tendency of graphene nanosheets to luffa sponges barred their localization inside the nanofibers 48 3 1 3 eds analysis fig 1s a shows the surface of the luffa sponge according to the figure no sediment is found and the luffa s smooth surface indicates the absence of layers of any foreign matter on its surface also fig 1s b shows the eds spectrum of raw luffa sponge according to the results a strong carbon signal is confirmed in the structure of this plant material the structure of raw luffa sponge consists of carbon and weak signals of o and n derived from surface bound biological molecules according to the diagram carbon peaks appear at approximately 0 5 kev which is surrounded in the luffa sponge structure by a thin layer of some organic matter due to the vegetation of the luffa sponge and its cellulosic structure the presence of carbon and oxygen is expected however the presence of n and its small peak relative to oxygen speculation increases that the structure of the luffa sponge is chitinous the diagram also shows that al has a higher value than the other elements found in addition the presence of calcium is due to the vegetation of the luffa sponge because calcium is an essential component for strengthening plants which is found in abundance fig 1s j shows the morphological composition of the elements of the empty luffa sponge based on its constituent elements according to the results this type of scattering indicates the structure of a luffa sponge fabric in which all the elements o c n na ca al s are evenly distributed on its surface and there is no accumulation this indicates the absence of external elements other than the elements that make up the raw luffa sponge fig 1s c j also confirm the presence of elements o c n na ca al s in the luffa sponge according to fig 2s a sediments appeared on the luffa s surface and tubular structures and coarse and fine spherical particles appeared on the surface of the luffa also fig 2s b displays the constituent elements of the modified luffa sponge are n c ka o s na and al according to the diagram si is also added to the luffa sponge compounds in addition their concentration has increased due to the increase of some element peaks the increase in carbon level from 1120 to 3200 indicates that it has been added almost three times to its concentration in a modified luffa sponge also the chart shows that the final modified luffa sponge has more calcium because calcium is of natural origin and is found in abundance in natural materials including those used to modify the properties of luffa moreover fig 2s k shows the elements present on the surface of the modified luffa sponge according to the images the presence of elements o si n na ca al c s on the modified luffa sponge is confirmed 3 2 contact angle fig 4a displays the water contact angle for the improved luffa sponge according to the results it is about 158 which indicates that the changes have been applied correctly and the modified luffa sponge is entirely hydrophobic in addition when oil droplets settle on the modified luffa sponge s surface they are rapidly absorbed contact angle 30 indicating an utterly oleophilic surface of the modified luffa sponge fig 4b in a 2017 study zhe wang et al used polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane poss to modify the surface of a raw luffa sponge to make it hydrophobic and oleophilic the analysis results show a contact angle of 155 with selective and high removal of oil stains 49 3 3 tga dtg analysis tga analysis is a way to study and discover how a substance behaves in the face of heat fig 5a and b show the thermogravimetric analysis tga of raw luffa and modified luffa sponge respectively according to the tga analysis raw luffa sponge lost some mass just before 100 c because it contains moisture also the results demonstrate that this sponge was in a normal constant temperature phase from 100 to 278 1 c and underwent temperature decomposition between 278 1 and 339 1 c then decomposed completely at 436 6 c eventually the mineral elements remained in other words they carbonized however the tga test of the modified luffa sponge fig 5b shows an increase in the product s temperature resistance according to the diagram the modified luffa sponge does not have moisture so it does not have a mass loss of empty luffa up to 100 c also the modified luffa sponge has a natural constant temperature phase from 0 to 348 1 c and is subjected to temperature decomposition between 348 1 and 394 3 c and is fully decomposed and carbonized at 497 2 c also the dtg results showed thermal decomposition of the modified luffa sponge slowed down at high temperatures and prolonged the time of thermal decomposition in 2021 yang et al created a three dimensional ultralight sponge using electro spun polyacrylonitrile pan nanofibers and natural luffa sponge pan nanofibers and luffa fibers were dispersed in an aqueous solution using polyvinyl alcohol pva and a three dimensional ultralight sponge was formed using frees drying technology they also added a spider web structure to the synthesized material to increase oil sorption the results of tga analysis clearly showed that two stages of mass loss occurred in two different temperature zones in the first stage the partial mass loss was about 100 c due to reducing the aqueous fraction also with increasing the amount of luffa sponge the structure of the sponge became more stable and its decomposition became more complex which was due to the increase in the number of hydrogen bonds in the sponge in addition as the hydrogen bonds decreased the sponge lost its stable structure and began to degrade rapidly 50 in a report presented in 2019 mingguang yu et al examined the effect of fe3o4 modified nanofibers on oil water separation the results of tga analysis showed that both fabrics of raw cotton and cotton modified with fe3o4 nanoparticles with diverse amounts of ferric chloride and iron chloride started to decompose at temperatures up to 300 c these observations displayed that the modification of the cotton surface with fe3o4 nanoparticles did not destroy the chemical structure of raw cotton fabrics 51 3 4 optimization of sorption behavior of modified luffa sponge the final modified sponge s oil water separation sorption was studied using the response technique and central composite design ccd three parameters of graphene concentration a wax concentration b and time c were measured to improve the percentage of removal r table 1s the important effect of each factor curving and contact between them on response was considered by the software of design experts according to table 2s the values gained for the parameters of p value ab ac and bc are more than 0 05 and it appears that these three factors don t have any important effect on the response and should be removed table 4s also the p value of other parameters was fewer than 0 05 and there is no need to eliminate them thus the gained equation for the response level r was calculated based on the eq 5 5 r 2 32614 868 353 a 201 634 b 6 693 c 4032 364 a 2 299 648 b 2 1 232 c 2 fig 3s a represents a contour plot and three dimensional diagram of the calculated response surface from the communication between graphene and wax concentration while keeping time at zero levels according to the results with rising graphene and wax concentration up to 0 102 g and 0 31 g respectively the removal percentage has increased up to 81 fig 3s b displays the effect of graphene concentration and time on the removal percentage keeping wax concentration at zero levels the graph demonstrates that the maximum removal percentage 82 happened at a graphene concentration of 0 1 g and a time of 3 12 min which confirms the model an interaction between the remaining two parameters wax concentration and time fig 3s c differed slightly from the earlier responses when a usual possibility residuals plot was created a selection was made for the regularity supposition which was acceptable since closely all the residuals fell almost along a straight line fig 3s d since the nearer the r2 value is to 1 0 the more reliable the model predicts the response the r2 gained here displays that the model has a good predictive ability thus from the fig 3s analysis and the responses attained in practice the optimum method conditions were graphene concentration 0 108 g wax concentration 0 338 g and time 2 587 min in addition based on the anova results the standard deviation was obtained 1 42 3 5 sorption of oil stains using final modified luffa sponge first the uncoated and final coated sponges were weighed before immersion in water and oil solution and after immersion they were removed for less than 5 min and then weighed again finally eq 1 calculated the amount of crude oil water sorption capacity eq 2 calculated the amount of crude oil water separation sorption and eq 3 calculated the amount of recycle crude oil water separation sorption table 1 displays the sponge mass before and after soaking also according to fig 6 the coated sponge s sorption capacity and separation sorption are higher than the uncoated sponge which confirms the oleophilic and hydrophobicity of the modified luffa sponge in addition according to fig 7 the percentage of separation sorption during 10 cycles almost has been the same but after the 11th cycle the percentage of separation sorption has decreased dramatically it is due to the reduction of oleophilic effects and properties of sorbent also fig 8 shows the coated floating sponge on the water oil s surface because graphene is hydrophobic and does not allow water to pass through it and reach the fiber in addition it absorbs a large amount of oil on the surface so the modified luffa sponge s hydrophobicity and oleophilic were proven in 2018 diwakar et al investigated the effect of a graphene modified luffa and raw luffa sponge on oil sorption rate from the water surface the results showed that the sorption rates of treated sponges and raw sponges were 4 735 g and 2 533 g respectively doubling the oil uptake by graphene modified luffa sponge is clear evidence of increased oil uptake 18 finally some foam sorbents sorption capacity or separation sorption has been reported in table 2 the results for some sorbents like melamine and polyurethane sponge were higher than the present work however the luffa sponge was modified by graphene nanosheets and natural waxes due to cost effectiveness ecofriendly and accessibility also the most critical point is the biodegradability of this sorbent 4 conclusion recently the use of biodegradable nano sorbents to collect oil pollution has received much attention this study investigated the performance of a biodegradable final modified sponge which was synthesized by simple dip coating technology for sorption of crude oil stains from oil water pollution in this study ftir sem and eds analyzes were used to investigate the morphological properties of the synthesized nano sorbents also tga analysis showed that the final modified luffa sponge has a higher temperature resistance than the raw luffa sponge in addition the contact angle for the modified sponge was 158 which confirmed that the final modified sponge was superhydrophobic examination of the sorption performance of the final modified sponge showed oil water separation sorption above 91 32 and sorption capacity above 11 92 g g and can be reused for up to 10 cycles the synthesized nano sorbent can be used in oil projects as a highly efficient alternative

12882,several market studies predict an increasing demand for activated carbons ac in the future to reduce the amount of fresh ac reactivated ac can be used therefore the present study deals with the systematical investigation and optimization of thermal reactivation of ac used for water purification in rotary kilns the aim is to restore the adsorption properties as far as possible with minimal energy input in this study ac from wastewater and drinking water treatment were selected the experiments follow a statistical design of experiments varying the heating rate heating time and composition of gas atmosphere on reactivation process to analyze the quality of reactivation besides structural also several chemical and energetic properties of acs were selected in terms of structural properties the large difference concerning the inner surface between fresh and exhausted wastewater carbon 50 8 can be restore by thermal reactivation with temperatures of 900 c up to 91 3 for drinking water carbon the difference in internal surface area between fresh and exhausted ac was much smaller 14 9 temperatures in the range of 600 c are already sufficient to restore the internal surface almost completely the composition of the gas atmosphere is of minor importance for both ac with regard to surface chemistry it was found for both carbons that weak acids adsorb on the carbons during application in water purification the acids partially desorb during thermal reactivation however at the same time a slight change in surface chemistry occurs and the surface chemistry becomes more aromatic character graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords activated carbon thermal reactivation design of experiments water purification characterization 1 introduction activated carbon ac and new advanced materials such as polyhydroquinone graphene nanocomposite materials or polymers can be used for purification of water 1 6 however in industrial application the use of ac is state of the art for example ac in granular gac or powdered pac form is used for the removal of micropollutants in the so called fourth treatment stage in municipal wastewater treatment e g in germany or switzerland 7 8 scenario calculations predict an additional annual demand of 41 000 metric tons ac in germany if half of the municipal wastewater plants are fitted with a fourth stage 9 another market study shows that the purification of liquids consumes 80 of the ac produced worldwide with drinking water treatment being the largest consumer 10 stricter regulatory requirements for organic micropollutants will further increase the demand for acs in drinking water treatment in the near future 11 if the adsorption capacity of an ac is exhausted it must either be replaced with fresh ac or it must be regenerated or reactivated while acs used in gas purification can often be regenerated in situ by temperature swing adsorption tsa or by pressure swing adsorption psa ex situ thermal reactivation is state of the art for ac used in liquid purification furthermore the reactivation of exhausted ac using microwaves is currently investigated 12 in particular short reactivation times of 8 12 min and direct reactivation of wet ac in the microwave oven without prior drying are advantageous in this respect nevertheless it is only suitable for small amounts of activated carbons therefore for the reactivation of ac from industrial scale using hundreds of kilos thermal reactivation should be used the recovery of the adsorption capacity during thermal reactivation is usually carried out in the four steps drying desorption pyrolysis and oxidation drying of ac at 100 c and above involves evaporation of water from the intermediate grain volume and pore water desorption of light volatile organic compounds takes place in the range of 100 c 500 c and breaks the bond between the molecule and the ac surface during pyrolysis molecules are pyrolytically decomposed at about 300 c 700 c before the remaining molecules and reaction products are removed in the oxidation stage from about 600 c by reaction with oxygen o2 water vapor h2o or carbon dioxide co2 the addition of co2 causes a pore opening at high temperatures followed by a broadening of the microporosity while h2o already broadens the microporosity at lower temperature 13 due to the overlapping of the temperature ranges the steps cannot be clearly separated 14 21 for industrial reactivation of ac mainly deck kilns fluidized bed kilns and rotary kilns are used 22 the reactivation success is determined by a large number of material and process related variables most important material related variables are particle size and raw material of the ac as well as chemical composition and quantity of the adsorbed components adsorbates process related variables include temperature residence time in the reactivation kiln and composition of gas atmosphere 23 24 the process parameters depend on the type of kiln as well as the type of load and the conditions during application of the ac in water treatment for example the process parameters for reactivation of ac from wastewater treatment are different from those from drinking water treatment depending on the choice of process parameters in addition to the removal of adsorbates an undesired change in structural properties as well as surface chemistry may occur in literature residence time temperature and h2o partial pressure are mentioned as essential variables for a homogeneous product in deck kilns which should be optimized by reactor design 25 for fluidized bed kilns klein et al found that at 800 c the process yield is dependent on gas velocity reactor shape and residence time they obtained good reactivation at a residence time of 30 min 26 jüntgen and reichenbacher recommend a temperature range of 750 c to 850 c for steam reactivation in a fluidized bed reactor 27 sontheimer et al specify temperatures between 700 c and 800 c and a residence time of 20 min for fluidized bed reactivation according to them a temperature below 750 c leads to an insufficient reaction rate of adsorbates a temperature above 850 c results in a too fast reaction of the carbon which causes a collapse of pore walls and reduces porosity 28 for rotary kilns only a few studies have been published so far the effects of the various influencing variables have been mainly investigated by studying small quantities of ac mg to g under laboratory conditions acs were loaded with individual components mostly phenol and its derivatives in batch tests and subsequently regenerated 15 19 systematic investigation of the correlation between reactivation process conditions and reactivation performance has been carried out only for empirical operational optimization and not to obtain a fundamental understanding of the processes as a result little quantitative information can be found in scientific literature however rotary kilns are becoming increasingly important due to lower investment maintenance and personnel costs and greater flexibility in start up and shut down 29 further advantages are the robustness and better process control by varying speed temperature and gas input 22 to conclude several studies on thermal reactivation of ac can be found in literature 30 31 however most of them focus on the reactivation of ac and its adsorption properties for a specific adsorptive 32 34 in addition most thermal reactivations are performed with small amounts of ac and not with large amounts in a rotary kiln a general investigation on the predominant mechanism is completely missing also the most studies focus only on the effects on the structural properties of ac a holistic investigation on the mechanical structural chemical and energetic properties is missing in the present study the spent ac was thermally reactivated under different experimental conditions the mechanical structural and chemical properties of the reactivated carbons were investigated the target is to characterize the adsorption properties of the exhausted ac with respect to the original fresh ac taking into account energy demand and mechanical stability of the reactivates for this purpose ac from wastewater ac ww and drinking water treatment ac dw plant were selected thermal reactivation experiments were performed using a laboratory rotary kiln according to the statistical design of experiments doe plan established by systematically varying heating rate heating time and composition of the gas atmosphere h2o n2 ratio and co2 n2 ratio the reactivated ac exhausted ac and fresh ac samples were characterized for various quality parameters such as internal surface area total pore volume pore size distribution number of surface acid oxides adsorption enthalpy and adsorption preference in a binary liquid mixture of polar acetone and aromatic toluene and the results were compared 2 materials methods 2 1 materials both investigated samples are water steam granular ac supplied by donau carbon ac ww is a coal from a raw material of fossil origin and ac dw from coconut shells ac ww was used in a central sewage treatment plant to remove trace substances such as drug residues x ray contrast media or household chemicals before the wastewater is fed into the fourth ac treatment stage it passes through the three purification stages mechanical biological treatment and chemical phosphorus elimination due to numerous impurities originating from the application ac ww was first cleaned by water washing for this purpose 1 kg of ac ww was mixed with 5 l of water stirred for 1 min and finally sieved the pretreatment removed coarse impurities such as sewage sludge and mussels after going through these steps five times the water was separated from the ac ww by spinning in a centrifuge the carbon was then dried in an oven universal oven model unb 500 memmert gmbh germany at 110 c for 7 days ac dw was used in a drinking water treatment plant which purifies river water prior to ac filtration the river water is infiltrated into the subsurface via large percolation basins in the subsurface perforated seepage pipes collect the water for further treatment the water consists of enriched groundwater bank filtrate and natural groundwater after pumping to the surface the collected water is treated by ozonation flocculation and multilayer filtration the ozone concentration after dosing is in the range of 0 25 to 0 3 mg l but no ozone is detectable in the water at the outlet of the filter system before ac filtration no pretreatment was carried out for the ac dw prior to the drying process at 110 c for 7 days for all reactivation experiments exhausted ac ww and ac dw with a particle size of 0 6 mm 2 36 mm were used 2 2 thermal reactivation 2 2 1 rotary kiln thermal reactivation experiments were carried out in a bench scale rotary kiln as shown in fig 1 in a typical experiment 400 g of the exhausted ac was placed in a rotatable stainless steel reactor and heated the rotation of the kiln tube 3 rpm ensures a good mixing of the ac and therefore a homogeneous heat transfer as well as a good mass transfer an n2 gas atmosphere flow rate 250 l h was maintained throughout the experiment after reactivation the ac was cooled down to room temperature and taken for characterization 2 2 2 experimental plan the four influencing variables so called factors in doe heating rate heating time h2o n2 ratio and co2 n2 ratio were systematically varied in a full factorial experimental plan with two levels low and high with four factors this results in 24 16 reactivation experiments within the test area see table 1 low and high level are defined in such a way that the test area includes the most relevant range of the respective factors in this context low and high level for heating rate and time were calculated to reach a final kiln temperature of 450 c or 900 c respectively before starting the experimental heating process the kiln was first heated to 300 c below 450 c the reactivation success was expected to be too low and above the 900 c it was expected that excessive mass losses occur furthermore the expected nonlinear relationship between the factors was taken into account by including so called star points outside the test area and the central point inside the test area into the experimental plan in order to determine random scatter and confidence intervals statistical validation the central point of the test area was realized four times the minimal and maximal final kiln temperature at the outside lower and outside upper star point is 457 c and 818 c respectively only eight further experiments were performed due to the addition to the star points as the most relevant results were expected to be in the test area table 1 shows the range of the test area incl the central points and the lower and upper star points the defined distances between the two levels the center and the star points established the orthogonal experimental design desired for the mathematical evaluation since lower star points with negative h2o n2 and co2 n2 ratios are not possible d optimality was adopted to improve initial experimental design and two experiments with these negative values were canceled 35 this resulted in 26 instead of 28 different reactivation experiments per ac sample 2 3 characterization in order to evaluate the success of reactivation pore structure as well as surface properties of the adsorbents were characterized before and after reactivation 2 3 1 physical properties to evaluate the mechanical stability of granulated acs the ball pan hardness was determined following astm d 3802 79 the ball pan hardness was calculated according to eq 1 1 h 100 b a where h is the ball pan hardness number b the weight of sample retained on the hardness test sieve and a the weight of sample loaded onto the hardness pan 36 2 3 2 structural properties characterization of pore structure was done by volumetric gas sorption measurements at isothermal conditions with nitrogen at 77 k and carbon dioxide at 273 k in addition mercury porosimetry was performed nitrogen isotherms were measured using an autosorb iq quantachrome instruments and carbon dioxide isotherms using a belsorp mini bel japan from the nitrogen isotherms the specific internal surface area was calculated using bet theory according to din iso 9277 37 the pore volume using the gurvich rule according to din 66134 38 the micropore volume using the equation of dubinin astakhov according to din 66135 3 39 and the pore size distribution by applying density functional theory kernel n2 at 77 k on carbon slit cylindrical pores qsdft adsorption from quantachrome instruments according to iso 15901 3 40 the pore size range in pore size distribution was extended by evaluating the carbon dioxide isotherms with density functional theory kernel co2 at 273 k on carbon nldft model von quantachrome instruments according to iso 15901 3 40 to the submicropore range versawin 2 0 software from quantachrome instruments was used to evaluate the experimental data investigations of mesopore and macropore volume and pore size distribution were performed by mercury intrusion porosimetry according to din iso 15901 1 41 using a pascal 140 400 porotec gmbh a cylindrical and plate model was used to determine the pore size distribution from the experimental data 2 3 3 chemical properties according to treese et al aromatic aliphatic polar and aliphatic non polar binding sites can be distinguished on the surface of acs in a simplified view 42 aromatic and non polar binding sites are located in the predominantly graphitic regions in addition acidic surface oxides can be found acidic surface oxides are polar groups whose type and number have a great influence on the polarity of the ac surface 43 boehm titration is used for quantitative determination of acidic surface oxide groups carboxyl lactone lactol phenol and carbonyl groups 14 43 44 due to the different acid strength of the surface oxides bases with different basicity can be used to selectively neutralize the groups for example the group with the highest acid strength the carboxyl group can be neutralized with sodium hydrogen carbonate nahco3 the weakest base sodium carbonate na2co3 the second strongest base additionally neutralizes lactone and lactol groups finally phenol and carbonyl groups additionally react with the strongest base naoh the base consumptions used to calculate the number of the respective surface groups can be obtained by determining the amount of unreacted base in an acid base titration with hydrochloric acid hcl while the molar equivalent of the carboxyl groups corresponds to the base consumption of nahco3 the molar equivalents of the other surface oxides result from the differences in respective base consumptions 45 46 experiments in this work were performed following goertzen et al and oickle et al 47 48 a detailed description of the procedure can be found in muthmann et al 46 when evaluating the surface chemistry of acs in addition to the type of polar surface groups the ratio of the three types of binding sites polar non polar and aromatic is particularly important 49 50 to characterize these adsorption sites adsorption in the liquid phase of binary mixtures at constant temperature was investigated the measured data obtained are so called excess isotherms excess isotherms are measured using sample molecules that form different interactions with the adsorbent for example acetone can be used as polar component toluene as aromatic component and n heptane as nonpolar component it is assumed that the sample molecules adsorb selectively on the corresponding surface groups excess isotherms are measured from binary mixtures of these sample molecules with different mole fractions for this purpose the ac is immersed in binary liquid mixtures 51 54 a detailed experimental procedure can be found in muthmann et al 46 52 for excess isotherms the reduced adsorption excess is plotted as a function of mole fraction of the bulk phase at equilibrium if the reduced excess of the binary mixture is positive preferential adsorption of component 1 occurs leading to a decrease in concentration of this component if the reduced excess is negative component 2 is preferentially adsorbed at the intersection with the x axis which is called azeotropic point adsorption of both components is equal the mole fraction of the azeotropic point indicates the ratio of the binding sites preferentially occupied by component 1 to the binding sites preferentially occupied by component 2 2 3 4 energetic properties to assess the energetic value of adsorption sites and the strength of the interactions between adsorbent molecule and adsorbent surface the adsorption enthalpy can be used to determine the load dependent adsorption enthalpy a sensor gas calorimeter according to bläker et al 55 56 was used and coupled with the volumetric measuring device autosorb iq quantachrome instruments with the device adsorption isotherms and adsorption enthalpies can be measured simultaneously a detailed description of the setup can be found in bläker et al 55 56 a thermodynamic evaluation of the measured variables was carried out by mauer et al 57 3 results 3 1 physical properties for a further use of the acs after reactivation not only adsorptive but also mechanical properties are of interest the influence of mechanical stress during thermal reactivation in the rotary kiln on the hardness of the ac was assessed by the ball pan hardness according to astm d 3802 the results are shown for ac ww left and ac dw right in fig 2 the dimensionless hardness is plotted on the ordinate the measurement error was determined by replicate measurements and is 5 for ac ww samples the fresh activated carbon fc has a very low hardness of 34 the exhausted activated carbon ec and all reactivates ri on the other hand exhibit high hardness of an identical order of magnitude the lower hardness of fc can be attributed to two reasons as an unused carbon the fc was not yet in contact with water and therefore probably still has dust and ash in the pore system which lead to abrasion in the test pretreatment with water fc h2o was able to increase the hardness of the carbon to 52 therefore confirming this assumption on the other hand during the ball pan hardness experiments mainly macropores are destroyed as can be seen below in fig 6 a large part of the macropores is closed during application in wastewater treatment and only partially opened during thermal reactivation here it can be assumed that mainly biological substances sewage sludge and colloidal aggregates have settled in the macropores these could reinforce the pore structure which is why high mechanical stability occurs with the reactivates and the ec a suspected decrease in mechanical stability as a result of thermal treatment in the rotary kiln is not detected in the case of the drinking water carbon fc ec and all reactivates have a very high hardness the high hardness of the fc can probably be explained by the fact that the ac dw has significantly fewer macropores compared to the ac ww see fig 6 and is therefore less susceptible to mechanical stress the similar hardness of fc ec and the reactivates shows that there is no negative influence of the mechanical stress during thermal reactivation on the stability 3 2 structural properties the measured nitrogen isotherms are presented below as load in cm3 g on the ordinate versus dimensionless relative pressure on the abscissa to analyze the pore size distribution of the acs the differential pore volume in cm3 g on the ordinate is plotted versus the pore size in nm on the abscissa using gaussian error propagation relative load errors of 5 could be determined for all measurements due to the large number of reactivates a full presentation of all isotherms is not possible so that selected data are shown in the following figures fig 3 shows the results of nitrogen sorption on selected ac ww for all nitrogen isotherms an almost vertical increase in load is initially observed in the relative pressure range 0 05 due to filling of the micropores subsequently the increase flattens in the intermediate relative pressure range during multilayer adsorption in large micropores and small mesopores finally a steep increase follows at high relative pressures p p0 0 9 due to capillary condensation the ec has the lowest load while the fc has the highest load all reactivates arrange themselves between these two carbons the fc is a completely unloaded ac in which the entire pore system is available for the adsorption of nitrogen since the ec has a pre load of adsorptives from the wastewater treatment plant application it has the lowest load of nitrogen in the case of the reactivates depending on the respective reactivation conditions part of the pre load was removed and pores were opened again so that a higher load with nitrogen can be achieved the level of load can be interpreted with the help of the inner surface and pore volumes which characterize the quality of the reactivates in particular the inner surface area will be used in the further analysis to assess the success of the reactivation for the nitrogen isotherms shown in fig 3 the quality parameters and the process parameters of the thermal reactivation are summarized in table 2 table 2 shows that the difference in internal surface area between ec and fc is 423 m2 g or 50 2 the worst reactivate r6 achieves 70 8 and the best reactivate r5 91 3 related to the internal surface area of the fc from the pore size distribution fig 3 right it is evident that the wastewater carbon is a multimodal ac with micro meso and macropores the ec has the smallest and the fc the largest differential pore volume the reactivates show a pore volume intermediate between the fresh and the ec for reactivate r5 which has the largest internal surface area of the reactivates an almost complete restoration of the pore volume can be seen in the micro and mesopore region with regard to the pore size distribution it is noticeable that thermal reactivation does not cause a shift in the pore size due to pore expansion but simply reopens already existing pore systems the different quality of the reactivates is due to variation of process parameters during thermal reactivation in the following the influence of the composition of gas atmosphere and the influence of final temperature which results from the multiplication of the heating time with the heating rate plus the temperature of the preheated rotary kiln of 300 c are discussed for this purpose fig 4 compares the reactivates r4 0 3 0 3 r9 0 0 0 3 r22 0 3 0 0 and r27 0 0 0 0 for the influence of composition of gas atmosphere h2o n2 co2 n2 and the reactivates r4 600 c r5 900 c and r6 450 c for the influence of temperature given heating time and heating rate a variation in the composition of gas atmosphere shows no significant influence on the shape of the isotherm and pore size distribution consequently the composition of gas atmosphere plays only a minor role in the reactivation of the wastewater carbon investigated here when varying final temperature all nitrogen isotherms show an identical pattern however the reactivates feature an increasing nitrogen load with increasing final temperature with reactivate r6 having the lowest load at 450 c and reactivate r5 having the highest load at 900 c at higher temperatures during thermal reactivation more strongly bound molecules desorb which increases the number of available sites on the surface the desorption can even lead to opening of closed pores both effects cause an increase in nitrogen sorption the best reactivate r5 has the highest reactivation temperature 900 c and reaches an internal surface area of 769 m2 g this is 91 3 of the internal surface area of the fc since the best sample is at the edge of the parameter range further samples were reactivated either the final temperature was increased to 1050c or a holding plateau was implemented i e the sample was held at the final temperature for a defined time for sample ep2 shown in fig 4 a final temperature of 1050c was chosen with an h2o n2 ratio of 0 3 and a co2 n2 ratio of 0 0 sample ep4 has the same gas atmosphere composition and was held at a final temperature of 900 c for a duration of 180 min compared to reactivate r5 sample ep2 has a slightly lower load and an almost identical pore size distribution the lower load indicates that at a temperature above 900 c either thermal destruction of pore structure occurs or macromolecules from recombination processes are deposited in the pore system although volatile decomposition products should be discharged with the gas stream as a result of recombination reactions of radical fragments with the surface clogging of the pore system and reduction of adsorption capacity may occur the reactivate ep4 on the other hand shows a more pronounced increase in load at high relative pressures and a 5 1 increase in capacity compared to the best reactivate r5 ep4 reaches an internal surface area of 813 m2 g and therefore 96 4 of the internal surface area of the fc an additional input of energy by introducing a holding plateau therefore seems beneficial for the structural properties of the ac the additional energy leads to the generation of new pores in the mesopore area which increases the capacity of nitrogen and the internal surface area since the energy consumption also increases a mathematical evaluation doe must be used to check whether the introduction of the holding plateau also makes economic sense the nitrogen isotherms for selected reactivates of the investigated drinking water carbon are shown in fig 5 all nitrogen isotherms exhibit a rapid increase in the load above 150 cm3 g in the relative pressure range 0 05 as a result of filling of the micropores this is followed by a transition to a load plateau which remains nearly constant over the entire pressure range the load plateau indicates that the carbon is almost entirely microporous with little multilayer adsorption occurring the ec shows the lowest load which can be attributed to the pre load from the drinking water treatment application the fc on the other hand is a completely unloaded ac and therefore shows a higher capacity the difference in the internal surface areas of fc and ec is very small at 150 m2 g or 14 9 respectively suggesting that only a small pre load is present in the ec all reactivates show higher loads than the ec some reactivates have even higher loads than the fc in relation to the fc the worst reactivate reaches 90 2 of the inner surface and the best reactivate r3 108 0 of the inner surface through thermal reactivation part of the pore system of the fc is recovered presumably the temperature during reactivation is higher than during activation of the ac so that the best reactivates even achieve a higher load with nitrogen than the fc compared to the ac ww the ac dw has a larger proportion of micropores there are significantly fewer pores in the meso and macropore area among the group of drinking water carbons the ec has the lowest differential pore volume the best reactivate r3 has the largest pore volume see table 3 due to the use in drinking water treatment the pore structure of the ec seems to be partially blocked however due to thermal reactivation overactivation takes place in the reactivates at higher temperatures this results in the reactivate r3 with the largest internal surface area also having a larger pore volume than the fc new pores are mainly generated in the range between 2 nm and 5 nm see fig 5 right in the mesopore area almost no change in pore size takes place in all samples final temperature and composition of gas atmosphere during reactivation have the same influence on the reactivates in the drinking water carbon as already discussed for the wastewater carbon for a more detailed look at the effects of thermal reactivation on pore structure fig 6 shows pore size distributions combined from measurements of co2 sorption n2 sorption and hg porosimetry for the wastewater carbon left and the drinking water carbon right for the wastewater carbon it can be seen that there are large differences in differential pore volume between the ec and the fc over the entire pore size range however thermal reactivation can almost completely restore the pore structure in the micro and mesopore range in the macropore region only part of the pore structure is reopened with the best reactivate r11 at 900 c by introducing a holding plateau of 180 min at 900 c ep4 macropores can be opened presumably the additional energy input leads to opening of pore structure in the macropore region this is associated with an increase in pore volume in the mesopore region the drinking water carbon shows only a slight difference in the pore structure between ec and fc over the entire pore range due to thermal reactivation an almost complete opening of all pores takes place 3 3 chemical properties to determine the sum of all surface oxides with the exception of carbonyl groups boehm titration can be carried out with 0 05 m sodium hydroxide solution 43 44 however the number of surface groups can be distored by ash residues and other basic and acidic components in order to avoid this boehm titration is additionally carried out with nahco3 by subtraction of the consumptions of naoh and nahco3 the influence of ash as well as further components can be eliminated and the sum of phenol and lactone lactol groups can be determined phenol and lactone lactol groups are shown in fig 7 for ac ww left and ac dw right the data are presented as amount of substance related to the weight of the respective sample in μmol g the experimental errors of the boehm titration determined from replicate measurements are in the range of 8 10 in case of the wastewater carbon the fc shows a low and the ec a very high number of phenol and lactone lactol groups the value of the ec which is higher by a factor of nine indicates that not only phenol and lactone lactol groups were detected on the surface of the carbon additionally adsorbed components from the application in the wastewater treatment plant were neutralized presumably these are humic acids which have a comparable acid strength to lactone lactol groups the value determined therefore represents a sum parameter containing surface functional groups and adsorbed acidic molecules the two reactivates r11 900 c and r6 450 c exhibit significantly lower quantities two mechanisms probably overlap here on one hand thermal reactivation leads to partial desorption of adsorbed humic acids with increasing reactivation temperature a larger number of adsorbed components are desorbed so that the amount of substance decreases the reactivate r11 with a reactivation temperature of 900 c has almost the same amount of substance as the fc without humic substance only phenol and lactone lactol groups the higher amount of substance for the reactivate r6 indicates that at a reactivation temperature of 450 c some adsorbed components still remain on the carbon on the other hand a chemical modification of the surface groups may have taken place due to thermal reactivation the reactivate r11 will therefore probably not have the same number of phenol and lactone lactol groups as the fc however a quantitative statement on the extent to which the surface groups have been changed is not possible with the results of boehm titration the samples of the drinking water carbon show an analogous behavior with regard to change of surface groups however the number of phenol and lactone lactol groups of the fc is larger by a factor of 3 compared to the ac ww in the case of the ec there is again an additional contribution from adsorbed components so that a high amount of substance is detected the adsorbed components are again presumably acids which have a similar acid strength to lactone lactol groups in drinking water for example these could be weak carboxylic acids or amino acids compared to the humic acids in wastewater acids in drinking water are present in significantly lower concentrations due to longer residence time of ac in drinking water treatment processes there is nevertheless a significant load of acids during thermal reactivation these acids are desorbed the higher amount of substance of r12 600 c compared to the fc also indicates that some of the acids still remain on the carbon the amount of substance of r4 900 c is comparable to the amount of substance of the fc however it can also be assumed for the ac dw that a chemical modification of the surface groups takes place simultaneously to the desorption of the adsorbed acids by the thermal reactivation to further investigate the influence of thermal reactivation on surface chemistry excess isotherms were measured previous research showed that predominantly aromatic and polar surface groups are present on ac surfaces non polar groups on the other hand are present only in small numbers and therefore have a minor influence on adsorption behavior 46 therefore excess isotherms were measured for the system acetone toluene which represents the competitive adsorption of a polar component acetone and an aromatic component toluene in liquid phase the measured values are indicated by symbols and the data fitted with the redlich kister polynomial are shown as lines 58 the experimental errors calculated using gaussian error propagation are 0 12 mmol g at maximum fig 8 shows the excess isotherms for the wastewater carbon left and the drinking water carbon right the reduced adsorption excess of toluene г toluene e over the mole fraction of toluene in bulk phase at equilibrium x toluene b is presented the reduced adsorption excess г toluene e can be calculated from adsorbent amount before adsorption n 0 adsorbent mass m ac and mole fraction of bulk phase b before adsorption x toluene 0 and in adsorption equilibrium x toluene b according to eq 2 2 г toluene e n 0 m ac x toluene 0 x toluene b the azeotropic point represents the state when the ratio of the solvents adsorptives before the experiment and in equilibrium are equal from this it can be assumed that x toluene b of the azeotropic point corresponds to the proportion of binding sites preferentially occupied by toluene on the basis of the azeotropic point it is thus possible to determine the ratio of binding sites that are preferentially occupied by aromatic molecules compared to polar molecules all isotherms of the ac ww have an s shaped pattern the curves show a sign change of г i e and therefore have an azeotropic point for the fc and ec the azeotropic point is 0 52 for reactivate r11 an azeotropic point is recorded at 0 62 the fc and ec have an almost identical percentage of aromatic and polar binding sites therefore the application of the ac in a wastewater treatment plant does not seem to have any effect on surface groups the reactivate r11 has more aromatic groups than the ec and the fc as the azeotropic point at 0 62 shows the largest value of the three samples thermal reactivation probably formed a graphite like structure on the ac surface which has an aromatic character 59 also the number of polar sites may have decreased as a result of the removal of functional groups by thermal reactivation therefore the results of the excess isotherms of ac ww confirm the results of boehm titration they suggest that there has been a slight change in the surface chemistry due to thermal reactivation the excess isotherms of the drinking water carbon also show an s shaped pattern with a sign change the azeotropic point of the fc is 0 79 the fc has significantly more aromatic than polar groups and therefore shows an increased capacity compared for toluene the ec has an azeotropic point at 0 50 and has an identical number of aromatic and polar groups application in drinking water treatment has resulted in a change in surface chemistry with an increase in polar bonding sites new polar sites with surface oxides may have formed due to oxidation during the drinking water treatment process the reactivate r4 exhibits an azeotropic point at 0 58 and therefore again a lower proportion of polar binding sites compared to the ec as a result of thermal reactivation chemical modification of the surface has probably also occurred in ac dw due to the high temperatures an increasingly graphitic like structure with aromatic character is formed the number of polar functional groups such as the surface oxides can also decrease by desorption during the thermal treatment 3 4 energetic properties in order to further analyze the polarity of the carbon surface gas phase acetone adsorption isotherms and adsorption enthalpies were measured simultaneously using a sensor gas calorimeter acetone was used because of its polar properties the adsorption isotherms are shown as load in mmol g versus partial pressure in kpa for the ac ww in fig 9 left and the ac dw in fig 10 left the adsorption enthalpy is shown in kj mol versus load in mmol g in fig 9 right and fig 10 right using gaussian error propagation a maximum error in load of 5 and a maximum statistical error in enthalpy of adsorption of 2 5 kj mol were determined all adsorption isotherms show a large increase at low pressure due to adsorption in micropores followed by a flattening of the load due to multilayer adsorption in larger pores in the pressure range between 2 kpa and 28 kpa finally a second sharp increase in load occurs due to capillary condensation in mesopores such an isothermal curve is typical for adsorbents with a broad pore size distribution which is present in the case of ac ww the fc shows the highest capacity for acetone due to its intact and unloaded pore system the ec on the other hand is already partially loaded and parts of the pore system are blocked so that the capacity for acetone is lower through thermal reactivation the pre load could be removed and the pore system could be opened therefore the reactivates have a higher capacity compared to the ec the capacity for acetone is higher for reactivate r11 compared to r6 due to the higher reactivation temperature adsorption enthalpies in fig 9 right decrease continuously over the entire load range the enthalpy curves of all acs show an almost congruent pattern so that neither the application in wastewater treatment nor a following reactivation have significantly changed the energetic properties of the surface only in the initial range we observe a difference of up to 10 kj mol adsorption at low loads on the energetically most valuable polar adsorption sites in the micropores releases the highest enthalpy the lower adsorption enthalpy of the ec at low loads indicates that some polar adsorption sites in the micropores are not available presumably these are already covered by adsorbed components from the application in wastewater treatment the adsorption enthalpy decreases with increasing load for all carbons which is due to adsorption at energetically less valuable sites in larger pores the continuous decrease is typical for multimodal acs the abrupt drop in adsorption enthalpy to 30 kj mol at loads 4 mmol g evidences capillary condensation releasing the enthalpy of vaporization of acetone δhads 298 k 30 kj mol 60 in the adsorption isotherms of ac dw fig 10 left a significantly stronger increase of the isotherm at low pressures can be observed compared to ac ww this is due on one hand to the larger micropore volume and on the other hand to the higher number of polar surface groups which represent energetically valuable adsorption sites in the range between 5 kpa and 25 kpa the adsorption isotherm exhibits a load plateau due to the scarcity of mesopores at high pressures capillary condensation occurs in the few mesopores resulting in a weakly pronounced second slope of the load the shape of the isotherms is identical for the fc the ec and the two reactivates r4 and r12 however the reactivates show a higher capacity compared to the fc and ec the minor differences between the fc and the exhausted ac can be attributed to the nearly identical internal surfaces see table 3 the larger capacity of the reactivates r4 900 c and r12 600 c can be explained by overactivation due to thermal reactivation and higher polarity in the adsorption enthalpy curves a decreasing pattern up to 2 mmol g with a following plateau up to 4 5 mmol g can be seen for the fc and the ec for the reactivates a plateau is observed up to the 5 5 mmol g range the high values of adsorption enthalpy at low loads are due to adsorption on the energetically most valuable polar adsorption sites in the micropores the decrease occurs due to adsorption in larger pores the narrow pore size distribution of the ac is reflected in the plateau of adsorption enthalpy at 48 kj mol the plateau occurs because there is no broad pore size distribution in the region of the larger pores which would lead to a steady decrease in the enthalpy of adsorption at high loads the enthalpy initially increases before dropping abruptly to the enthalpy of vaporization of 30 kj mol the increase at 4 5 mmol g and 5 5 mmol g respectively is due to a superposition of three dimensional lateral interactions between acetone molecules and interactions with the adsorbent surface in the pores around 2 nm see fig 5 the subsequent drop to the evaporation enthalpy can be explained by capillary condensation as in the case of ac ww the almost congruent load dependent curves of the adsorption enthalpy of acetone on the ac dw show that identical polar adsorption sites on the surface can also be assumed here 4 conclusion outlook in this work optimum process parameters for the thermal reactivation of acs in a rotary kiln were determined in order to restore adsorption properties as far as possible for this purpose statistically designed experiments were carried out in a laboratory rotary kiln for thermal reactivation of exhausted acs from wastewater and drinking water treatment plants during the reactivation experiments heating rate heating time and composition of gas atmosphere h2o n2 ratio and co2 n2 ratio were systematically varied furthermore different methods were used to describe the effects of thermal reactivation on the mechanical structural energetic properties and surface chemistry of the acs with regard to mechanical stability no influence of thermal reactivation on the acs could be detected within the present parameter field in terms of structural properties large differences were evident in the wastewater carbon concerning the inner surface between ec and fc by thermal reactivation up to 91 3 of the inner surface of the fc could be restored the blocked pores were reopened without generating new pores it was shown that the final temperature is of particular importance for the success of the reactivation in contrast the composition of the gas atmosphere is of minor importance high temperatures of 900 c are necessary for reactivation of the wastewater carbon the implementation of a holding plateau of 180 min at this temperature led to a further opening of macropores and a generation of new mesopores for drinking water carbon the difference in internal surface area between exhausted and fresh ac was much smaller with 14 9 reactivation at high temperatures resulted in generating new pores in the range between 2 nm 5 nm yielding a larger internal surface area compared to the fc average temperatures in the range of 600 c are already sufficient to restore an internal surface similar in magnitude to that of the fc with regard to surface chemistry boehm titration for both carbons found that weak acids with an acid strength similar to lactone lactol groups adsorb on the carbons during application in water purification the acids partially desorb during thermal reactivation however at the same time a change in surface chemistry occurs excess isotherms with acetone toluene show that reactivates either form new aromatic areas or the amount of polar groups decreases compared to the ec sensor gas calorimetry with acetone reveals that the change in surface chemistry does not significantly affect the adsorption enthalpy in further research the results are to be verified by investigation of further carbons from various wastewater and drinking water treatment processes the raw material of the carbons will also be varied in addition sensitivity analyses will be carried out with the help of software

12882,several market studies predict an increasing demand for activated carbons ac in the future to reduce the amount of fresh ac reactivated ac can be used therefore the present study deals with the systematical investigation and optimization of thermal reactivation of ac used for water purification in rotary kilns the aim is to restore the adsorption properties as far as possible with minimal energy input in this study ac from wastewater and drinking water treatment were selected the experiments follow a statistical design of experiments varying the heating rate heating time and composition of gas atmosphere on reactivation process to analyze the quality of reactivation besides structural also several chemical and energetic properties of acs were selected in terms of structural properties the large difference concerning the inner surface between fresh and exhausted wastewater carbon 50 8 can be restore by thermal reactivation with temperatures of 900 c up to 91 3 for drinking water carbon the difference in internal surface area between fresh and exhausted ac was much smaller 14 9 temperatures in the range of 600 c are already sufficient to restore the internal surface almost completely the composition of the gas atmosphere is of minor importance for both ac with regard to surface chemistry it was found for both carbons that weak acids adsorb on the carbons during application in water purification the acids partially desorb during thermal reactivation however at the same time a slight change in surface chemistry occurs and the surface chemistry becomes more aromatic character graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords activated carbon thermal reactivation design of experiments water purification characterization 1 introduction activated carbon ac and new advanced materials such as polyhydroquinone graphene nanocomposite materials or polymers can be used for purification of water 1 6 however in industrial application the use of ac is state of the art for example ac in granular gac or powdered pac form is used for the removal of micropollutants in the so called fourth treatment stage in municipal wastewater treatment e g in germany or switzerland 7 8 scenario calculations predict an additional annual demand of 41 000 metric tons ac in germany if half of the municipal wastewater plants are fitted with a fourth stage 9 another market study shows that the purification of liquids consumes 80 of the ac produced worldwide with drinking water treatment being the largest consumer 10 stricter regulatory requirements for organic micropollutants will further increase the demand for acs in drinking water treatment in the near future 11 if the adsorption capacity of an ac is exhausted it must either be replaced with fresh ac or it must be regenerated or reactivated while acs used in gas purification can often be regenerated in situ by temperature swing adsorption tsa or by pressure swing adsorption psa ex situ thermal reactivation is state of the art for ac used in liquid purification furthermore the reactivation of exhausted ac using microwaves is currently investigated 12 in particular short reactivation times of 8 12 min and direct reactivation of wet ac in the microwave oven without prior drying are advantageous in this respect nevertheless it is only suitable for small amounts of activated carbons therefore for the reactivation of ac from industrial scale using hundreds of kilos thermal reactivation should be used the recovery of the adsorption capacity during thermal reactivation is usually carried out in the four steps drying desorption pyrolysis and oxidation drying of ac at 100 c and above involves evaporation of water from the intermediate grain volume and pore water desorption of light volatile organic compounds takes place in the range of 100 c 500 c and breaks the bond between the molecule and the ac surface during pyrolysis molecules are pyrolytically decomposed at about 300 c 700 c before the remaining molecules and reaction products are removed in the oxidation stage from about 600 c by reaction with oxygen o2 water vapor h2o or carbon dioxide co2 the addition of co2 causes a pore opening at high temperatures followed by a broadening of the microporosity while h2o already broadens the microporosity at lower temperature 13 due to the overlapping of the temperature ranges the steps cannot be clearly separated 14 21 for industrial reactivation of ac mainly deck kilns fluidized bed kilns and rotary kilns are used 22 the reactivation success is determined by a large number of material and process related variables most important material related variables are particle size and raw material of the ac as well as chemical composition and quantity of the adsorbed components adsorbates process related variables include temperature residence time in the reactivation kiln and composition of gas atmosphere 23 24 the process parameters depend on the type of kiln as well as the type of load and the conditions during application of the ac in water treatment for example the process parameters for reactivation of ac from wastewater treatment are different from those from drinking water treatment depending on the choice of process parameters in addition to the removal of adsorbates an undesired change in structural properties as well as surface chemistry may occur in literature residence time temperature and h2o partial pressure are mentioned as essential variables for a homogeneous product in deck kilns which should be optimized by reactor design 25 for fluidized bed kilns klein et al found that at 800 c the process yield is dependent on gas velocity reactor shape and residence time they obtained good reactivation at a residence time of 30 min 26 jüntgen and reichenbacher recommend a temperature range of 750 c to 850 c for steam reactivation in a fluidized bed reactor 27 sontheimer et al specify temperatures between 700 c and 800 c and a residence time of 20 min for fluidized bed reactivation according to them a temperature below 750 c leads to an insufficient reaction rate of adsorbates a temperature above 850 c results in a too fast reaction of the carbon which causes a collapse of pore walls and reduces porosity 28 for rotary kilns only a few studies have been published so far the effects of the various influencing variables have been mainly investigated by studying small quantities of ac mg to g under laboratory conditions acs were loaded with individual components mostly phenol and its derivatives in batch tests and subsequently regenerated 15 19 systematic investigation of the correlation between reactivation process conditions and reactivation performance has been carried out only for empirical operational optimization and not to obtain a fundamental understanding of the processes as a result little quantitative information can be found in scientific literature however rotary kilns are becoming increasingly important due to lower investment maintenance and personnel costs and greater flexibility in start up and shut down 29 further advantages are the robustness and better process control by varying speed temperature and gas input 22 to conclude several studies on thermal reactivation of ac can be found in literature 30 31 however most of them focus on the reactivation of ac and its adsorption properties for a specific adsorptive 32 34 in addition most thermal reactivations are performed with small amounts of ac and not with large amounts in a rotary kiln a general investigation on the predominant mechanism is completely missing also the most studies focus only on the effects on the structural properties of ac a holistic investigation on the mechanical structural chemical and energetic properties is missing in the present study the spent ac was thermally reactivated under different experimental conditions the mechanical structural and chemical properties of the reactivated carbons were investigated the target is to characterize the adsorption properties of the exhausted ac with respect to the original fresh ac taking into account energy demand and mechanical stability of the reactivates for this purpose ac from wastewater ac ww and drinking water treatment ac dw plant were selected thermal reactivation experiments were performed using a laboratory rotary kiln according to the statistical design of experiments doe plan established by systematically varying heating rate heating time and composition of the gas atmosphere h2o n2 ratio and co2 n2 ratio the reactivated ac exhausted ac and fresh ac samples were characterized for various quality parameters such as internal surface area total pore volume pore size distribution number of surface acid oxides adsorption enthalpy and adsorption preference in a binary liquid mixture of polar acetone and aromatic toluene and the results were compared 2 materials methods 2 1 materials both investigated samples are water steam granular ac supplied by donau carbon ac ww is a coal from a raw material of fossil origin and ac dw from coconut shells ac ww was used in a central sewage treatment plant to remove trace substances such as drug residues x ray contrast media or household chemicals before the wastewater is fed into the fourth ac treatment stage it passes through the three purification stages mechanical biological treatment and chemical phosphorus elimination due to numerous impurities originating from the application ac ww was first cleaned by water washing for this purpose 1 kg of ac ww was mixed with 5 l of water stirred for 1 min and finally sieved the pretreatment removed coarse impurities such as sewage sludge and mussels after going through these steps five times the water was separated from the ac ww by spinning in a centrifuge the carbon was then dried in an oven universal oven model unb 500 memmert gmbh germany at 110 c for 7 days ac dw was used in a drinking water treatment plant which purifies river water prior to ac filtration the river water is infiltrated into the subsurface via large percolation basins in the subsurface perforated seepage pipes collect the water for further treatment the water consists of enriched groundwater bank filtrate and natural groundwater after pumping to the surface the collected water is treated by ozonation flocculation and multilayer filtration the ozone concentration after dosing is in the range of 0 25 to 0 3 mg l but no ozone is detectable in the water at the outlet of the filter system before ac filtration no pretreatment was carried out for the ac dw prior to the drying process at 110 c for 7 days for all reactivation experiments exhausted ac ww and ac dw with a particle size of 0 6 mm 2 36 mm were used 2 2 thermal reactivation 2 2 1 rotary kiln thermal reactivation experiments were carried out in a bench scale rotary kiln as shown in fig 1 in a typical experiment 400 g of the exhausted ac was placed in a rotatable stainless steel reactor and heated the rotation of the kiln tube 3 rpm ensures a good mixing of the ac and therefore a homogeneous heat transfer as well as a good mass transfer an n2 gas atmosphere flow rate 250 l h was maintained throughout the experiment after reactivation the ac was cooled down to room temperature and taken for characterization 2 2 2 experimental plan the four influencing variables so called factors in doe heating rate heating time h2o n2 ratio and co2 n2 ratio were systematically varied in a full factorial experimental plan with two levels low and high with four factors this results in 24 16 reactivation experiments within the test area see table 1 low and high level are defined in such a way that the test area includes the most relevant range of the respective factors in this context low and high level for heating rate and time were calculated to reach a final kiln temperature of 450 c or 900 c respectively before starting the experimental heating process the kiln was first heated to 300 c below 450 c the reactivation success was expected to be too low and above the 900 c it was expected that excessive mass losses occur furthermore the expected nonlinear relationship between the factors was taken into account by including so called star points outside the test area and the central point inside the test area into the experimental plan in order to determine random scatter and confidence intervals statistical validation the central point of the test area was realized four times the minimal and maximal final kiln temperature at the outside lower and outside upper star point is 457 c and 818 c respectively only eight further experiments were performed due to the addition to the star points as the most relevant results were expected to be in the test area table 1 shows the range of the test area incl the central points and the lower and upper star points the defined distances between the two levels the center and the star points established the orthogonal experimental design desired for the mathematical evaluation since lower star points with negative h2o n2 and co2 n2 ratios are not possible d optimality was adopted to improve initial experimental design and two experiments with these negative values were canceled 35 this resulted in 26 instead of 28 different reactivation experiments per ac sample 2 3 characterization in order to evaluate the success of reactivation pore structure as well as surface properties of the adsorbents were characterized before and after reactivation 2 3 1 physical properties to evaluate the mechanical stability of granulated acs the ball pan hardness was determined following astm d 3802 79 the ball pan hardness was calculated according to eq 1 1 h 100 b a where h is the ball pan hardness number b the weight of sample retained on the hardness test sieve and a the weight of sample loaded onto the hardness pan 36 2 3 2 structural properties characterization of pore structure was done by volumetric gas sorption measurements at isothermal conditions with nitrogen at 77 k and carbon dioxide at 273 k in addition mercury porosimetry was performed nitrogen isotherms were measured using an autosorb iq quantachrome instruments and carbon dioxide isotherms using a belsorp mini bel japan from the nitrogen isotherms the specific internal surface area was calculated using bet theory according to din iso 9277 37 the pore volume using the gurvich rule according to din 66134 38 the micropore volume using the equation of dubinin astakhov according to din 66135 3 39 and the pore size distribution by applying density functional theory kernel n2 at 77 k on carbon slit cylindrical pores qsdft adsorption from quantachrome instruments according to iso 15901 3 40 the pore size range in pore size distribution was extended by evaluating the carbon dioxide isotherms with density functional theory kernel co2 at 273 k on carbon nldft model von quantachrome instruments according to iso 15901 3 40 to the submicropore range versawin 2 0 software from quantachrome instruments was used to evaluate the experimental data investigations of mesopore and macropore volume and pore size distribution were performed by mercury intrusion porosimetry according to din iso 15901 1 41 using a pascal 140 400 porotec gmbh a cylindrical and plate model was used to determine the pore size distribution from the experimental data 2 3 3 chemical properties according to treese et al aromatic aliphatic polar and aliphatic non polar binding sites can be distinguished on the surface of acs in a simplified view 42 aromatic and non polar binding sites are located in the predominantly graphitic regions in addition acidic surface oxides can be found acidic surface oxides are polar groups whose type and number have a great influence on the polarity of the ac surface 43 boehm titration is used for quantitative determination of acidic surface oxide groups carboxyl lactone lactol phenol and carbonyl groups 14 43 44 due to the different acid strength of the surface oxides bases with different basicity can be used to selectively neutralize the groups for example the group with the highest acid strength the carboxyl group can be neutralized with sodium hydrogen carbonate nahco3 the weakest base sodium carbonate na2co3 the second strongest base additionally neutralizes lactone and lactol groups finally phenol and carbonyl groups additionally react with the strongest base naoh the base consumptions used to calculate the number of the respective surface groups can be obtained by determining the amount of unreacted base in an acid base titration with hydrochloric acid hcl while the molar equivalent of the carboxyl groups corresponds to the base consumption of nahco3 the molar equivalents of the other surface oxides result from the differences in respective base consumptions 45 46 experiments in this work were performed following goertzen et al and oickle et al 47 48 a detailed description of the procedure can be found in muthmann et al 46 when evaluating the surface chemistry of acs in addition to the type of polar surface groups the ratio of the three types of binding sites polar non polar and aromatic is particularly important 49 50 to characterize these adsorption sites adsorption in the liquid phase of binary mixtures at constant temperature was investigated the measured data obtained are so called excess isotherms excess isotherms are measured using sample molecules that form different interactions with the adsorbent for example acetone can be used as polar component toluene as aromatic component and n heptane as nonpolar component it is assumed that the sample molecules adsorb selectively on the corresponding surface groups excess isotherms are measured from binary mixtures of these sample molecules with different mole fractions for this purpose the ac is immersed in binary liquid mixtures 51 54 a detailed experimental procedure can be found in muthmann et al 46 52 for excess isotherms the reduced adsorption excess is plotted as a function of mole fraction of the bulk phase at equilibrium if the reduced excess of the binary mixture is positive preferential adsorption of component 1 occurs leading to a decrease in concentration of this component if the reduced excess is negative component 2 is preferentially adsorbed at the intersection with the x axis which is called azeotropic point adsorption of both components is equal the mole fraction of the azeotropic point indicates the ratio of the binding sites preferentially occupied by component 1 to the binding sites preferentially occupied by component 2 2 3 4 energetic properties to assess the energetic value of adsorption sites and the strength of the interactions between adsorbent molecule and adsorbent surface the adsorption enthalpy can be used to determine the load dependent adsorption enthalpy a sensor gas calorimeter according to bläker et al 55 56 was used and coupled with the volumetric measuring device autosorb iq quantachrome instruments with the device adsorption isotherms and adsorption enthalpies can be measured simultaneously a detailed description of the setup can be found in bläker et al 55 56 a thermodynamic evaluation of the measured variables was carried out by mauer et al 57 3 results 3 1 physical properties for a further use of the acs after reactivation not only adsorptive but also mechanical properties are of interest the influence of mechanical stress during thermal reactivation in the rotary kiln on the hardness of the ac was assessed by the ball pan hardness according to astm d 3802 the results are shown for ac ww left and ac dw right in fig 2 the dimensionless hardness is plotted on the ordinate the measurement error was determined by replicate measurements and is 5 for ac ww samples the fresh activated carbon fc has a very low hardness of 34 the exhausted activated carbon ec and all reactivates ri on the other hand exhibit high hardness of an identical order of magnitude the lower hardness of fc can be attributed to two reasons as an unused carbon the fc was not yet in contact with water and therefore probably still has dust and ash in the pore system which lead to abrasion in the test pretreatment with water fc h2o was able to increase the hardness of the carbon to 52 therefore confirming this assumption on the other hand during the ball pan hardness experiments mainly macropores are destroyed as can be seen below in fig 6 a large part of the macropores is closed during application in wastewater treatment and only partially opened during thermal reactivation here it can be assumed that mainly biological substances sewage sludge and colloidal aggregates have settled in the macropores these could reinforce the pore structure which is why high mechanical stability occurs with the reactivates and the ec a suspected decrease in mechanical stability as a result of thermal treatment in the rotary kiln is not detected in the case of the drinking water carbon fc ec and all reactivates have a very high hardness the high hardness of the fc can probably be explained by the fact that the ac dw has significantly fewer macropores compared to the ac ww see fig 6 and is therefore less susceptible to mechanical stress the similar hardness of fc ec and the reactivates shows that there is no negative influence of the mechanical stress during thermal reactivation on the stability 3 2 structural properties the measured nitrogen isotherms are presented below as load in cm3 g on the ordinate versus dimensionless relative pressure on the abscissa to analyze the pore size distribution of the acs the differential pore volume in cm3 g on the ordinate is plotted versus the pore size in nm on the abscissa using gaussian error propagation relative load errors of 5 could be determined for all measurements due to the large number of reactivates a full presentation of all isotherms is not possible so that selected data are shown in the following figures fig 3 shows the results of nitrogen sorption on selected ac ww for all nitrogen isotherms an almost vertical increase in load is initially observed in the relative pressure range 0 05 due to filling of the micropores subsequently the increase flattens in the intermediate relative pressure range during multilayer adsorption in large micropores and small mesopores finally a steep increase follows at high relative pressures p p0 0 9 due to capillary condensation the ec has the lowest load while the fc has the highest load all reactivates arrange themselves between these two carbons the fc is a completely unloaded ac in which the entire pore system is available for the adsorption of nitrogen since the ec has a pre load of adsorptives from the wastewater treatment plant application it has the lowest load of nitrogen in the case of the reactivates depending on the respective reactivation conditions part of the pre load was removed and pores were opened again so that a higher load with nitrogen can be achieved the level of load can be interpreted with the help of the inner surface and pore volumes which characterize the quality of the reactivates in particular the inner surface area will be used in the further analysis to assess the success of the reactivation for the nitrogen isotherms shown in fig 3 the quality parameters and the process parameters of the thermal reactivation are summarized in table 2 table 2 shows that the difference in internal surface area between ec and fc is 423 m2 g or 50 2 the worst reactivate r6 achieves 70 8 and the best reactivate r5 91 3 related to the internal surface area of the fc from the pore size distribution fig 3 right it is evident that the wastewater carbon is a multimodal ac with micro meso and macropores the ec has the smallest and the fc the largest differential pore volume the reactivates show a pore volume intermediate between the fresh and the ec for reactivate r5 which has the largest internal surface area of the reactivates an almost complete restoration of the pore volume can be seen in the micro and mesopore region with regard to the pore size distribution it is noticeable that thermal reactivation does not cause a shift in the pore size due to pore expansion but simply reopens already existing pore systems the different quality of the reactivates is due to variation of process parameters during thermal reactivation in the following the influence of the composition of gas atmosphere and the influence of final temperature which results from the multiplication of the heating time with the heating rate plus the temperature of the preheated rotary kiln of 300 c are discussed for this purpose fig 4 compares the reactivates r4 0 3 0 3 r9 0 0 0 3 r22 0 3 0 0 and r27 0 0 0 0 for the influence of composition of gas atmosphere h2o n2 co2 n2 and the reactivates r4 600 c r5 900 c and r6 450 c for the influence of temperature given heating time and heating rate a variation in the composition of gas atmosphere shows no significant influence on the shape of the isotherm and pore size distribution consequently the composition of gas atmosphere plays only a minor role in the reactivation of the wastewater carbon investigated here when varying final temperature all nitrogen isotherms show an identical pattern however the reactivates feature an increasing nitrogen load with increasing final temperature with reactivate r6 having the lowest load at 450 c and reactivate r5 having the highest load at 900 c at higher temperatures during thermal reactivation more strongly bound molecules desorb which increases the number of available sites on the surface the desorption can even lead to opening of closed pores both effects cause an increase in nitrogen sorption the best reactivate r5 has the highest reactivation temperature 900 c and reaches an internal surface area of 769 m2 g this is 91 3 of the internal surface area of the fc since the best sample is at the edge of the parameter range further samples were reactivated either the final temperature was increased to 1050c or a holding plateau was implemented i e the sample was held at the final temperature for a defined time for sample ep2 shown in fig 4 a final temperature of 1050c was chosen with an h2o n2 ratio of 0 3 and a co2 n2 ratio of 0 0 sample ep4 has the same gas atmosphere composition and was held at a final temperature of 900 c for a duration of 180 min compared to reactivate r5 sample ep2 has a slightly lower load and an almost identical pore size distribution the lower load indicates that at a temperature above 900 c either thermal destruction of pore structure occurs or macromolecules from recombination processes are deposited in the pore system although volatile decomposition products should be discharged with the gas stream as a result of recombination reactions of radical fragments with the surface clogging of the pore system and reduction of adsorption capacity may occur the reactivate ep4 on the other hand shows a more pronounced increase in load at high relative pressures and a 5 1 increase in capacity compared to the best reactivate r5 ep4 reaches an internal surface area of 813 m2 g and therefore 96 4 of the internal surface area of the fc an additional input of energy by introducing a holding plateau therefore seems beneficial for the structural properties of the ac the additional energy leads to the generation of new pores in the mesopore area which increases the capacity of nitrogen and the internal surface area since the energy consumption also increases a mathematical evaluation doe must be used to check whether the introduction of the holding plateau also makes economic sense the nitrogen isotherms for selected reactivates of the investigated drinking water carbon are shown in fig 5 all nitrogen isotherms exhibit a rapid increase in the load above 150 cm3 g in the relative pressure range 0 05 as a result of filling of the micropores this is followed by a transition to a load plateau which remains nearly constant over the entire pressure range the load plateau indicates that the carbon is almost entirely microporous with little multilayer adsorption occurring the ec shows the lowest load which can be attributed to the pre load from the drinking water treatment application the fc on the other hand is a completely unloaded ac and therefore shows a higher capacity the difference in the internal surface areas of fc and ec is very small at 150 m2 g or 14 9 respectively suggesting that only a small pre load is present in the ec all reactivates show higher loads than the ec some reactivates have even higher loads than the fc in relation to the fc the worst reactivate reaches 90 2 of the inner surface and the best reactivate r3 108 0 of the inner surface through thermal reactivation part of the pore system of the fc is recovered presumably the temperature during reactivation is higher than during activation of the ac so that the best reactivates even achieve a higher load with nitrogen than the fc compared to the ac ww the ac dw has a larger proportion of micropores there are significantly fewer pores in the meso and macropore area among the group of drinking water carbons the ec has the lowest differential pore volume the best reactivate r3 has the largest pore volume see table 3 due to the use in drinking water treatment the pore structure of the ec seems to be partially blocked however due to thermal reactivation overactivation takes place in the reactivates at higher temperatures this results in the reactivate r3 with the largest internal surface area also having a larger pore volume than the fc new pores are mainly generated in the range between 2 nm and 5 nm see fig 5 right in the mesopore area almost no change in pore size takes place in all samples final temperature and composition of gas atmosphere during reactivation have the same influence on the reactivates in the drinking water carbon as already discussed for the wastewater carbon for a more detailed look at the effects of thermal reactivation on pore structure fig 6 shows pore size distributions combined from measurements of co2 sorption n2 sorption and hg porosimetry for the wastewater carbon left and the drinking water carbon right for the wastewater carbon it can be seen that there are large differences in differential pore volume between the ec and the fc over the entire pore size range however thermal reactivation can almost completely restore the pore structure in the micro and mesopore range in the macropore region only part of the pore structure is reopened with the best reactivate r11 at 900 c by introducing a holding plateau of 180 min at 900 c ep4 macropores can be opened presumably the additional energy input leads to opening of pore structure in the macropore region this is associated with an increase in pore volume in the mesopore region the drinking water carbon shows only a slight difference in the pore structure between ec and fc over the entire pore range due to thermal reactivation an almost complete opening of all pores takes place 3 3 chemical properties to determine the sum of all surface oxides with the exception of carbonyl groups boehm titration can be carried out with 0 05 m sodium hydroxide solution 43 44 however the number of surface groups can be distored by ash residues and other basic and acidic components in order to avoid this boehm titration is additionally carried out with nahco3 by subtraction of the consumptions of naoh and nahco3 the influence of ash as well as further components can be eliminated and the sum of phenol and lactone lactol groups can be determined phenol and lactone lactol groups are shown in fig 7 for ac ww left and ac dw right the data are presented as amount of substance related to the weight of the respective sample in μmol g the experimental errors of the boehm titration determined from replicate measurements are in the range of 8 10 in case of the wastewater carbon the fc shows a low and the ec a very high number of phenol and lactone lactol groups the value of the ec which is higher by a factor of nine indicates that not only phenol and lactone lactol groups were detected on the surface of the carbon additionally adsorbed components from the application in the wastewater treatment plant were neutralized presumably these are humic acids which have a comparable acid strength to lactone lactol groups the value determined therefore represents a sum parameter containing surface functional groups and adsorbed acidic molecules the two reactivates r11 900 c and r6 450 c exhibit significantly lower quantities two mechanisms probably overlap here on one hand thermal reactivation leads to partial desorption of adsorbed humic acids with increasing reactivation temperature a larger number of adsorbed components are desorbed so that the amount of substance decreases the reactivate r11 with a reactivation temperature of 900 c has almost the same amount of substance as the fc without humic substance only phenol and lactone lactol groups the higher amount of substance for the reactivate r6 indicates that at a reactivation temperature of 450 c some adsorbed components still remain on the carbon on the other hand a chemical modification of the surface groups may have taken place due to thermal reactivation the reactivate r11 will therefore probably not have the same number of phenol and lactone lactol groups as the fc however a quantitative statement on the extent to which the surface groups have been changed is not possible with the results of boehm titration the samples of the drinking water carbon show an analogous behavior with regard to change of surface groups however the number of phenol and lactone lactol groups of the fc is larger by a factor of 3 compared to the ac ww in the case of the ec there is again an additional contribution from adsorbed components so that a high amount of substance is detected the adsorbed components are again presumably acids which have a similar acid strength to lactone lactol groups in drinking water for example these could be weak carboxylic acids or amino acids compared to the humic acids in wastewater acids in drinking water are present in significantly lower concentrations due to longer residence time of ac in drinking water treatment processes there is nevertheless a significant load of acids during thermal reactivation these acids are desorbed the higher amount of substance of r12 600 c compared to the fc also indicates that some of the acids still remain on the carbon the amount of substance of r4 900 c is comparable to the amount of substance of the fc however it can also be assumed for the ac dw that a chemical modification of the surface groups takes place simultaneously to the desorption of the adsorbed acids by the thermal reactivation to further investigate the influence of thermal reactivation on surface chemistry excess isotherms were measured previous research showed that predominantly aromatic and polar surface groups are present on ac surfaces non polar groups on the other hand are present only in small numbers and therefore have a minor influence on adsorption behavior 46 therefore excess isotherms were measured for the system acetone toluene which represents the competitive adsorption of a polar component acetone and an aromatic component toluene in liquid phase the measured values are indicated by symbols and the data fitted with the redlich kister polynomial are shown as lines 58 the experimental errors calculated using gaussian error propagation are 0 12 mmol g at maximum fig 8 shows the excess isotherms for the wastewater carbon left and the drinking water carbon right the reduced adsorption excess of toluene г toluene e over the mole fraction of toluene in bulk phase at equilibrium x toluene b is presented the reduced adsorption excess г toluene e can be calculated from adsorbent amount before adsorption n 0 adsorbent mass m ac and mole fraction of bulk phase b before adsorption x toluene 0 and in adsorption equilibrium x toluene b according to eq 2 2 г toluene e n 0 m ac x toluene 0 x toluene b the azeotropic point represents the state when the ratio of the solvents adsorptives before the experiment and in equilibrium are equal from this it can be assumed that x toluene b of the azeotropic point corresponds to the proportion of binding sites preferentially occupied by toluene on the basis of the azeotropic point it is thus possible to determine the ratio of binding sites that are preferentially occupied by aromatic molecules compared to polar molecules all isotherms of the ac ww have an s shaped pattern the curves show a sign change of г i e and therefore have an azeotropic point for the fc and ec the azeotropic point is 0 52 for reactivate r11 an azeotropic point is recorded at 0 62 the fc and ec have an almost identical percentage of aromatic and polar binding sites therefore the application of the ac in a wastewater treatment plant does not seem to have any effect on surface groups the reactivate r11 has more aromatic groups than the ec and the fc as the azeotropic point at 0 62 shows the largest value of the three samples thermal reactivation probably formed a graphite like structure on the ac surface which has an aromatic character 59 also the number of polar sites may have decreased as a result of the removal of functional groups by thermal reactivation therefore the results of the excess isotherms of ac ww confirm the results of boehm titration they suggest that there has been a slight change in the surface chemistry due to thermal reactivation the excess isotherms of the drinking water carbon also show an s shaped pattern with a sign change the azeotropic point of the fc is 0 79 the fc has significantly more aromatic than polar groups and therefore shows an increased capacity compared for toluene the ec has an azeotropic point at 0 50 and has an identical number of aromatic and polar groups application in drinking water treatment has resulted in a change in surface chemistry with an increase in polar bonding sites new polar sites with surface oxides may have formed due to oxidation during the drinking water treatment process the reactivate r4 exhibits an azeotropic point at 0 58 and therefore again a lower proportion of polar binding sites compared to the ec as a result of thermal reactivation chemical modification of the surface has probably also occurred in ac dw due to the high temperatures an increasingly graphitic like structure with aromatic character is formed the number of polar functional groups such as the surface oxides can also decrease by desorption during the thermal treatment 3 4 energetic properties in order to further analyze the polarity of the carbon surface gas phase acetone adsorption isotherms and adsorption enthalpies were measured simultaneously using a sensor gas calorimeter acetone was used because of its polar properties the adsorption isotherms are shown as load in mmol g versus partial pressure in kpa for the ac ww in fig 9 left and the ac dw in fig 10 left the adsorption enthalpy is shown in kj mol versus load in mmol g in fig 9 right and fig 10 right using gaussian error propagation a maximum error in load of 5 and a maximum statistical error in enthalpy of adsorption of 2 5 kj mol were determined all adsorption isotherms show a large increase at low pressure due to adsorption in micropores followed by a flattening of the load due to multilayer adsorption in larger pores in the pressure range between 2 kpa and 28 kpa finally a second sharp increase in load occurs due to capillary condensation in mesopores such an isothermal curve is typical for adsorbents with a broad pore size distribution which is present in the case of ac ww the fc shows the highest capacity for acetone due to its intact and unloaded pore system the ec on the other hand is already partially loaded and parts of the pore system are blocked so that the capacity for acetone is lower through thermal reactivation the pre load could be removed and the pore system could be opened therefore the reactivates have a higher capacity compared to the ec the capacity for acetone is higher for reactivate r11 compared to r6 due to the higher reactivation temperature adsorption enthalpies in fig 9 right decrease continuously over the entire load range the enthalpy curves of all acs show an almost congruent pattern so that neither the application in wastewater treatment nor a following reactivation have significantly changed the energetic properties of the surface only in the initial range we observe a difference of up to 10 kj mol adsorption at low loads on the energetically most valuable polar adsorption sites in the micropores releases the highest enthalpy the lower adsorption enthalpy of the ec at low loads indicates that some polar adsorption sites in the micropores are not available presumably these are already covered by adsorbed components from the application in wastewater treatment the adsorption enthalpy decreases with increasing load for all carbons which is due to adsorption at energetically less valuable sites in larger pores the continuous decrease is typical for multimodal acs the abrupt drop in adsorption enthalpy to 30 kj mol at loads 4 mmol g evidences capillary condensation releasing the enthalpy of vaporization of acetone δhads 298 k 30 kj mol 60 in the adsorption isotherms of ac dw fig 10 left a significantly stronger increase of the isotherm at low pressures can be observed compared to ac ww this is due on one hand to the larger micropore volume and on the other hand to the higher number of polar surface groups which represent energetically valuable adsorption sites in the range between 5 kpa and 25 kpa the adsorption isotherm exhibits a load plateau due to the scarcity of mesopores at high pressures capillary condensation occurs in the few mesopores resulting in a weakly pronounced second slope of the load the shape of the isotherms is identical for the fc the ec and the two reactivates r4 and r12 however the reactivates show a higher capacity compared to the fc and ec the minor differences between the fc and the exhausted ac can be attributed to the nearly identical internal surfaces see table 3 the larger capacity of the reactivates r4 900 c and r12 600 c can be explained by overactivation due to thermal reactivation and higher polarity in the adsorption enthalpy curves a decreasing pattern up to 2 mmol g with a following plateau up to 4 5 mmol g can be seen for the fc and the ec for the reactivates a plateau is observed up to the 5 5 mmol g range the high values of adsorption enthalpy at low loads are due to adsorption on the energetically most valuable polar adsorption sites in the micropores the decrease occurs due to adsorption in larger pores the narrow pore size distribution of the ac is reflected in the plateau of adsorption enthalpy at 48 kj mol the plateau occurs because there is no broad pore size distribution in the region of the larger pores which would lead to a steady decrease in the enthalpy of adsorption at high loads the enthalpy initially increases before dropping abruptly to the enthalpy of vaporization of 30 kj mol the increase at 4 5 mmol g and 5 5 mmol g respectively is due to a superposition of three dimensional lateral interactions between acetone molecules and interactions with the adsorbent surface in the pores around 2 nm see fig 5 the subsequent drop to the evaporation enthalpy can be explained by capillary condensation as in the case of ac ww the almost congruent load dependent curves of the adsorption enthalpy of acetone on the ac dw show that identical polar adsorption sites on the surface can also be assumed here 4 conclusion outlook in this work optimum process parameters for the thermal reactivation of acs in a rotary kiln were determined in order to restore adsorption properties as far as possible for this purpose statistically designed experiments were carried out in a laboratory rotary kiln for thermal reactivation of exhausted acs from wastewater and drinking water treatment plants during the reactivation experiments heating rate heating time and composition of gas atmosphere h2o n2 ratio and co2 n2 ratio were systematically varied furthermore different methods were used to describe the effects of thermal reactivation on the mechanical structural energetic properties and surface chemistry of the acs with regard to mechanical stability no influence of thermal reactivation on the acs could be detected within the present parameter field in terms of structural properties large differences were evident in the wastewater carbon concerning the inner surface between ec and fc by thermal reactivation up to 91 3 of the inner surface of the fc could be restored the blocked pores were reopened without generating new pores it was shown that the final temperature is of particular importance for the success of the reactivation in contrast the composition of the gas atmosphere is of minor importance high temperatures of 900 c are necessary for reactivation of the wastewater carbon the implementation of a holding plateau of 180 min at this temperature led to a further opening of macropores and a generation of new mesopores for drinking water carbon the difference in internal surface area between exhausted and fresh ac was much smaller with 14 9 reactivation at high temperatures resulted in generating new pores in the range between 2 nm 5 nm yielding a larger internal surface area compared to the fc average temperatures in the range of 600 c are already sufficient to restore an internal surface similar in magnitude to that of the fc with regard to surface chemistry boehm titration for both carbons found that weak acids with an acid strength similar to lactone lactol groups adsorb on the carbons during application in water purification the acids partially desorb during thermal reactivation however at the same time a change in surface chemistry occurs excess isotherms with acetone toluene show that reactivates either form new aromatic areas or the amount of polar groups decreases compared to the ec sensor gas calorimetry with acetone reveals that the change in surface chemistry does not significantly affect the adsorption enthalpy in further research the results are to be verified by investigation of further carbons from various wastewater and drinking water treatment processes the raw material of the carbons will also be varied in addition sensitivity analyses will be carried out with the help of software

12883,selenium contamination of water resources has become a potential health risk issue the application of aluminium iron alfe mixed oxide for the rapid adsorption of both selenite iv and selenate vi ions from water was studied the synthesized alfe mixed oxide was characterized to understand the morphological and structural properties batch adsorption experiments were performed to understand the adsorption performance with variable parameters alfe mixed oxide was found as efficient for both selenite iv and selenate vi ion adsorption over a wide ph range up to ph 9 adsorption experiments revealed that the dose of 0 1 g l 1 with an initial selenium concentration of 500 μg l 1 is sufficient to meet the who guideline value within the first 30 min of contact time langmuir temkin and dubinin radushkevich dr adsorption isotherm and pseudo second order kinetics presented better fitting for selenite iv and selenate vi ions with maximum adsorption capacity for se vi and se iv as 33 1 mg g 1 and 6 188 mg g 1 respectively column adsorption and regeneration were also studied to understand the practical applicability of the adsorbent the adsorbent was regenerated using mild alkali and can further be reused without any significant decrease in adsorption efficiency graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords alfe mixed oxide se adsorption regeneration column adsorption 1 introduction selenium se is an essential micronutrient for living organisms at lower concentrations however the excess of se present in the environment is responsible for severe risks and damage to living organisms unwanted se present in environment is a cause of water soil and atmospheric pollution and when se is consumed in excess it shows detrimental health impacts the main reason for the enhanced attention of the scientific community in recent years is increasing evidences of selenium pollution in india as well as in the other parts of the world it is now being considered as emerging pollutant and studied to find better solutions for selenium remediation from water 1 selenium contamination in the environment occurs through natural and anthropogenic sources natural sources of selenium contamination include geogenic contamination the release of se through terrestrial coal deposits weathering of se containing rocks and se enriched soil in the environment 2 3 the anthropogenic contamination of selenium occurs via coal combustion by thermal power plants oil refineries agricultural practices such as the use of fertilizers and mining discharge 4 the mining wastewater contains a higher concentration of selenium ions up to 1000 μg l 1 4 5 selenium occurs in the environment as selenite iv and selenate vi species these are the most prevalent forms of oxyanion inorganic selenium species as both selenite and selenate are soluble in normal environmental conditions selenite exists as major solution species at moderate redox conditions in the soil whereas selenate exists at high redox conditions 6 although soil minerals promptly adsorb selenite species a relatively high concentration of selenate species is usually observed in industrial wastewater which is a major source of anthropogenic contamination of selenium in the environment 7 due to the toxic behavior of selenium the maximum acceptable concentration set by world health organization who is 40 μg l 1 selenium for drinking water and the bureau of indian standards bis guidelines for selenium in the drinking water is 10 μg l 1 10 in india the northwest region is highly affected by selenium contamination of soil and water the groundwater selenium concentration in this region is observed up to 1000 μg l 1 7 8 there are some recent case reports in the northwest region about the selenium toxicity symptoms with dystrophy of fingernails toenails patch hair loss over the scalp increased hair fragility etc 9 this alarming condition accentuate the development of robust and cost effective treatment technologies for selenium removal to meet the drinking water standards the widely applied selenium removal technologies include various processes such as ion exchange reverse osmosis chemical methods ferrihydrites co precipitation adsorption and chemical reduction methods 2 3 the existing technologies are mainly effective for se iv removal and are not able to treat se vi to meet the who guideline value for selenium removal from water hence the treatment technologies for the effective removal of both inorganic selenium species are required the adsorption processes are known for various inorganic pollutant remediations from water this method is widely known for easy operations cost effectiveness environmentally safe process and ability to reduce the contaminants to low levels 7 60 61 hence development of low cost functional adsorbents for efficient removal of se iv and se vi with superior adsorption capacity has immense importance for field applications the recent literature shows various adsorbents reported for selenium removal from water including metal oxides hydroxides carbon and graphene based adsorbents natural clay minerals and oxides nano zero valent iron n zvi has been widely studied for efficient se iv removal applications from water and wastewater it is studied that under acidic conditions the inorganic selenium species tend to adsorb on iron oxides and hydroxides subsequently these oxides control solubility of selenium species in water 3 iron and aluminium oxides are abundant minerals found in the earth s crust these oxides exhibit high surface area and point of zero charge pzc these oxides are indispensable in the transport and mobility of various anionic contaminants in the water and soil 17 these materials are known as efficient adsorbents for pollutant removal from industrial wastewaters and drinking water however metal oxides have gained the attention of researchers in the last few decades due to their wide manufacturing economical and easy applications along with other systems with the increasing application of nanotechnology researchers are focusing on applications of nano metal oxides and their composites for anionic pollutant remediation owing to its large surface area and more active adsorption sites 13 the nanocrystalline forms of metal oxides and hydroxides such as hematite α fe2o3 11 al iii sio2 and fe iii sio2 7 mnp hematite 12 ferrihydrite hematite composite 14 maghemite nano transition alumina γ δ al2o3 15 γ feooh 16 are reported for selenium adsorption from aqueous solutions ferrihydrite is commonly known as amorphous iron oxide or hydrous ferric oxide and is commonly found in the surface environment ferrihydrite is known to have hematite like structure with hexagonal closed packing of oxygen atoms with fe ions in octahedral spaces this form of iron oxide is characterized by its combination of defective and defect free structural units the presence of octahedral sheet with z direction is 2 for feroxyhyte 4 for ferrihydrite and 6 for hematite c 0 46 nm 0 94 nm 1 3752 nm respectively the poor crystallinity of first two forms i e ferrihydrite and feroxyhyte is related to the existing vacant sites of fe in this structure and substitution of these few sites by oxygen oh and or h2o in case of ferrihydrite a variety of compounds with varying structural degree occurs and these compounds are described by the number of broad x ray peaks present in the structure as e g 2 line and 6 line ferrihydrite the composition of ferrihydrite is variable with respect to h2o and oh as the structural water composition may change compared to the suggested formula 18 19 ferrihydrite owing to its amorphous nature with very high surface area are ubiquitous in natural environment and are known as active adsorbent das et al studied the selenate adsorption by three synthetic iron oxy hydroxides i e 2 line ferrihydrite lepidocrocite and goethite the findings showed that 2 line ferrihydrite showed efficient selenate adsorption under near neutral conditions with high surface area 20 peak and sparks reported selenate adsorption mechanism on hematite goethite and hydrous ferric oxide hfo hematite forms inner sphere complexes with selenate however goethite and hfo forms both outer sphere and inner sphere complexes or mixtures of these complexes with selenate 22 experimental conditions like ph ionic strength surface loading plays a vital role in adsorption experiments and impact reaction mechanisms hence the adsorption mechanism of anions on metal oxides should not be only the inner sphere or outer sphere but it can be an intermediate between the outer and inner sphere mechanism 21 22 a comparative study of al2o3 nano al2o3 and chitin adsorbents for selenite adsorption were reported by jegadeesan et al 2003 however the selenate adsorption was not discussed 23 peak 2006 studied the mechanism of selenium ions adsorption on aluminium oxides 17 there are very few reports of ferrihydrite for selenium adsorption from aqueous solutions aluminium and iron mixed oxides or composites for selenium adsorption have not yet been studied reports containing the detailed work and thorough studies including reaction kinetics isotherm and column studies are lacking for selenate adsorption on ferrihydrite considering the field application or practical implementation therefore in the present study aluminium iron mixed oxide of high adsorption efficiency was explored for efficient selenium ions adsorption from water this study involves detailed dose adsorption studies isotherm effect of competing anions and kinetic studies along with continuous flow column experiment strengthening the field applicability of selected adsorbent 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials al no3 3 9h2o fe no3 3 9h2o sigma aldrich acs reagent 98 and nh4oh sigma aldrich acs reagent 28 0 30 0 nh3 basis were used as a precursor and precipitating agent

dissolved in 30 ml distilled water in a 250 ml beaker this solution was kept for stirring at room temperature for 10 min ph 1 0 in the next step of the reaction nh4oh solution was added dropwise to the above solution till the precipitation ph was achieved ph 8 the resultant suspension was continuously stirred for 1 h the color of the suspension changes to reddish brown indicating the precipitation of hydroxide phases the resultant precipitate was filtered and washed with distilled water and oven dried at 100 c for 8 h the dried sample was then calcined at different calcination temperatures 300 c 500 c 700 c and 900 c and stored for further experiments similarly pure aluminium oxide and iron oxide were synthesized by using the similar method mentioned above to compare the characteristics of mixed metal oxide with pure metal oxide 10 45 g of al no3 3 9h2o was dissolved in 200 ml distilled water in 500 ml beaker the solution is kept for stirring at 400 rpm for 30 min ph

temperature 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of alfe composite 3 1 1 structural analysis the x ray diffraction pattern for alfe samples calcined at 300 c 500 c 700 c and 900 c is shown in fig 1 the alfe samples calcined at 300 c show two broad peaks at 40 and 75 as observed from fig 1 c these peaks indicated amorphosity in the sample however these peaks are matched with a two line ferrihydrite structure icdd file no 00 029 0712 these are hydrous ferric oxide structures with hexagonal symmetry belonging to the p63mc space group aluminium was easily doped in this structure as aluminium is well known to form an isostructural p63mc space group phase of oxyhydroxide named akdalaite as the calcination temperature was increased from 300 c to 500 c the hematite crystal phase started crystallizing along with the ferrihydrite phase as indicated in fig 1 d at 700 c the ferrihydrite phase completely disappeared fig 1 e with the formation of only the hematite phase fe2o3 with rhombohedral crystal system icdd file no 00 024 0072 individual alumina phases were not observed in the sample till the 700 c calcination temperature which indicated aluminium metal was doped or distributed throughout the hematite structure while hematite crystallized in the rhombohedral system with r3 c space group corundum is the commonly and naturally occurring mineral of alumina which crystallizes into a trigonal structure with r3 c space group some authors may consider the trigonal and rhombohedral crystal systems as the same but they are not equivalent some with trigonal symmetry may also belong to the hexagonal lattice as alumina and hematite belong to a similar space group with a similar crystal structure the formation of mixed metal oxide homogenous in aluminium and iron content throughout the lattice is highly probable formation of hematite by dehydration of iron hydroxide fe oh 3 g298 15 378 1 kcal mol is thermodynamically more favourable than that of corundum g298 15 177 7 kcal mol hence observed dominantly in xrd standard free energy change of dehydration for hematite is lower than that of corundum 30 31 al substitution in hematite decreases all unit cell parameters towards corundum as well as the synthetic temperature affects the unit cell length of hematite the substitution of al3 in hematite structure induces strain in the ordered structure as alo bonds are shorter compared to feo which might greatly hinder long range crystal formation and hence amorphous nanocrystalline structure was obtained for alfe samples calcined at lower temperatures the presence of oh group in vacant sites also induces strain as all the three hydrogen atoms are not necessarily present in a single octahedron of o2 surrounding fe atom but the presence of such oh groups had not been determined although it is fairly reasonable to assume their presence at higher calcination temperature 700 c in case of hematite oh groups present on the surface of the structure are evaporated as water molecules with the increase in temperature protons within the lattice diffused to the surface to be driven off as water molecules which leads to fe3 enrichment at the surface the resulting charge imbalance in the bulk material creates a driving force for fe3 diffusion inside the lattice from the surface to compensate for the positive charge deficiency due to proton diffusion to the surface 30 however fe diffusion only starts above tamman temperature which is approximately half of the melting point for hematite m p of hematite 1565 c hence long range ordered lattice formation is favoured above this temperature which agrees with the experimental fact that ordered hematite structure is observed only above 700 c from xrd 32 33 the presence of fe3 ions at the surface also acts as cation adsorption sites for se vi ions and hence alfe material is expected to show superior adsorption capacity as the calcination temperature is further increased to 900 c a few peaks of corundum started to appear as an impurity as shown in fig 1 f this phase segregation occurred due to thermodynamic feasibility achieved at this high temperature fig 1 3 1 2 raman spectroscopy raman spectroscopy detects the frequency shift caused by inelastic scattering of radiation interacting with molecules 49 the monochromatic laser light interacts with vibrational modes in a crystal lattice called phonons 50 if the molecules scatter monochromatic radiation without changing their wavelength it is called elastic scattering rayleigh scattering on the contrary if the wavelength of incident light changes its wavelength it is called inelastic scattering raman scattering it is the difference between elastic and inelastic scattering that is measured in raman spectroscopy 51 52 the energy of inelastic scattering varies with changing vibrational mode of crystal lattice resulting in a frequency shift in raman spectroscopy which is specific for each mineral 28 fig 2 shows raman spectra of alumina iron mixed oxide af calcined at 300 c 500 c 700 c 900 c respectively af 300 af 500 af 700 af 900 pure iron oxide fe 300 and aluminium oxide al 300 calcined at 300 c it was observed that the pure fe 300 sample shows characteristic peaks at 219 286 403 489 605 and 1312 cm 1 the characteristic peaks indicated the formation of the hematite phase and these peaks disappear after the addition of aluminium to the structure for the af 300 sample however at higher calcination temperatures 500 700 and 900 c peaks corresponding to pure fe 300 started to appear again al 300 showed characteristic peaks of corundum phase at 353 489 675 and 1044 cm 1 which were not observed in the case of mixed oxide material from the results it was seen that the synthesized material contains a dominant phase of iron while aluminium was homogeneously doped in the iron oxide oxyhydroxide structure as reported by nesheva et al intensity of the raman scattering band decreases and their full width half maxima fwhm increases with the increasing disorder in the crystal structure as well with decreasing particle size raman spectra exhibit much sharper peaks for particles having larger size 100 nm while decreasing particle size increases peak broadness which is due to the phonon confinement effect 24 25 the model phonon confinement is based on the fact that only the phonon near to brillouin zone contributes to raman spectra where q 0 q is defined as the given wave vector for which oscillatory wave motion of atoms around their equilibrium position is described by system of 3 n equations q 0 near brillouin zone because of conservation of momentum between the incident light and phonons and so peaks are sharp while finite crystal phonons are confined by crystal boundaries and defects this results in the uncertainty of phonon momentum where phonons with q 0 also give rise to spectra causing peak broadening a well crystallized sample with micrometre grain size is treated as an infinite crystal for all practical purposes while the effect of phonon confinement is noticeable in vibration spectra only when the grain size is smaller than 20 lattice parameters 26 for af 300 spectra where alumina was doped in fe structure no sharp peaks were observed this was also an indication of the formation of nanocrystals further the broad band at 716 cm 1 indicated the presence of a 2 line ferrihydrite phase in this sample the difference between af 300 and fe 300 spectra was sharply in contrast while both materials were synthesized with the same method af 300 contained additional al doped into the fe structure the addition of al to the material restricts crystal growth to nanocrystalline size and increases disorder in the structure and hence only a broad peak at 716 cm 1 was observed however as calcination temperature was increased it resulted in increased crystallinity as also observed from xrd raman peaks corresponding to that of fe 300 structure start to appear in the spectra of af 500 af 700 and af 900 fe 300 sample shows characteristic peaks for hematite structure as supported from the literature 27 28 the reported literature contains visible raman bands at 225 291 411 500 611 and 1321 cm 1 corresponding to 219 286 403 489 605 and 1312 cm 1 for fe 300 material it may also be noticed that all the peaks in fe 300 structure were shifted towards lower energy which may be associated with the presence of impurities in the structure if the crystal has strained bonds then the atoms are pulled apart resulting in the increased chemical bond length as the chemical bond increases and the force constant remains the same the vibrational frequency decreases the characteristic peak for ferrihydrite structure at 710 cm 1 was not observed while major peaks for hematite structure were observed seven phonon lines are expected in the raman spectrum of hematite as it belongs to the d3d space group and 2 ag1 modes and five eg modes at 225 247 293 299 412 498 and 613 cm 1 the 293 and 299 cm 1 bands are only resolved at 100 k and hence indistinguishable at room temperature or may appear as a shoulder at 293 cm 1 the intense band at 1314 cm 1 was assigned to two magnon scattering which originate due to the antiferromagnetic nature of hematite tem images also further support the nanocrystalline nature of the sample where small 5 10 nm particles were aggregated to form larger particles these raman results were well supported by the xrd results 3 1 3 surface area measurements the specific surface area for alfe mixed oxide 300 sample was estimated to be as high as 155 4 m2 g with pore volume 0 43 cm3 g and pore diameter of 10 3 nm as derived from bet bjh plot fig 3 the adsorption isotherms illustrate the adsorption behavior of the materials the shape of the adsorption desorption isotherm as shown in the fig 3 bear a resemblance to a type iv isotherm with the presence of distinguishing hysteresis loop in the multilayer range 56 these results indicate the porous adsorbent nature with pores generally ranging from 1 5 100 nm af 300 was mesoporous in nature and specific surface area was way higher than that of synthetic hematite at high pressure the increase in adsorbate is observed as the pores get filled and the inflection point is generally observed near completion of the first monolayer 57 this high surface area increases exposure to adsorption sites and contributes to the higher adsorption capacity of the sample 3 1 4 sem and tem analysis fig 4a c shows scanning electron micrographs for pure alumina particles are highly aggregated and form a gelatinous matrix fig 4d f shows sem micrographs of pure iron oxide irregular shaped particles are observed while upon higher magnification smaller particles seem to aggregate to form larger particles with dimensions in the range of 50 150 nm fig 4g i show sem micrographs for synthesized af 300 the particle morphology is found in between that of pure alumina and red oxide the particle dimensions are in the range of 20 50 nm which is much smaller than the previously observed size for iron oxide particles spherical particles were observed aggregated together or embedded in the gelatinous matrix the smaller particle size is attributed to aluminium addition which restricts crystal growth tem micrographs and saed pattern of af 300 sample are shown in fig 5 it is observed that each particle observed in fig 5g i is made of small spherical aggregates contrary to the observation in the previous study where the addition of al to hematite structure resulted in the formation of nanoflakes or disk like structure where crystal growth was restricted to only one phase the observed particles are cubic to spherical with smooth edges 33 the selected area electron diffraction saed pattern of the af 300 sample is shown in fig 5 c and f the saed pattern indicates the polycrystalline nature of the material additionally in the saed pattern that fewer diffraction spots confirm the two line ferrihydrite phase as indicated by xrd analysis also fig 6a c shows hrtem images of the af 300 sample the lattice spacing observed in individual nanospheres of 2 5 å corresponds to the 110 crystalline plane of ferrihydrite structure the 110 200 and 106 planes are the dominant planes observed for ferrihydrite structure in xrd with high intensities icdd 00 029 0712 observation of these planes in hr tem images corresponding to the ferrihydrite crystalline phase in the af 300 sample indicated the presence of ferrihydrite nanocrystal in the sample xrd data also confirmed the same with observed diffraction lines 3 1 5 elemental analysis the elemental composition of the as synthesized af 300 sample was mapped using energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds the eds spectra is as shown in fig 7 a b and c respectively the elemental composition of fe and al was found to be 1 0 49 the distribution of iron and aluminium was found completely uniform throughout the samples indicating uniform aluminium doping over ferrihydrite structure 3 1 6 xps analysis the evaluation of chemical shifts in binding energies bes originating from the different chemical environments of the same energy level is a commonly and extentensively used method for the determination of the oxidation state of metal in metal oxides the survey scan of af 300 sample shows the presence of fe al and o as observed from fig 8a the atomic percent of individual atoms observed from survey scan of xps are found in agreement with the ferrihydrite structure fe10o14 oh 2 fe5o7 oh fe5o8h 4h2o fe2o3 0 5h2o where fe is found 33 while oxygen contributes 63 it has also been observed that aluminium is present in structure where 13 of the total iron is replaced by aluminium two characteristic 2p 3 2 and 2p 1 2 bands were observed in high resolution xps spectra of iron as shown in fig 8b a typical satellite peak for α fe2o3 is also observed at a binding energy of 718 8 ev 35 36 the deconvoluted spectra of fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 show the presence of two types of fe species the determination of 2 line ferrihydrite structure is inherently difficult because of its amorphous nature and nanocrystallite size however recent endeavours have thrown some light on its structure with the help of reverse monte carlo refinement rmc and pair distribution modelling pdf it was concluded that single phase akdalite like ferrihydrite model is most probable ruling out the possibility of multi phase structure mixture of defective and defect free ferrihydrite nanocrystals along with uniformly dispersed hematite 37 the single phase ferrihydrite structure consists of tetrahedrally feo4 and octahedrally feo6 coordinated iron species which is also evident from high resolution xps spectra of iron 2p where deconvoluted spectra shows presence of two types of species ferrihydrite in its ideal form should contain 20 of feo4 and 80 feo6 polyhedra but the occupancy of fe sites changes with change in the particle size resulting in the increased disorder of the structure the ratio of tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated iron species varies and may be present from 0 40 in sample 38 in the synthesized samples tetrahedral fe was found 37 fe3 present in ferrihydrite is in high spin state as o2 ligand does not have the ability to split crystal field of octahedrally coordinated species to limit the d electron in the spin paired state as evident from the fig 8b since low spin compounds are unable to undergo multiplet splitting and only a single peak may be observed 34 only fe3 species should be present in the ideal hematite structure while multiplet peaks were observed in the xps spectra and hence the af 300 sample is assumed to take form of disordered ferrihydrite than the stable hematite structure 3 2 selenium adsorption experiments 3 2 1 ph adsorption study the adsorption process is mainly dependent on the ph of the solution and this study is an important parameter for the field application of the adsorbent hence to determine the performance of alfe mixed oxide different ph solutions were optimized for selenium adsorption in this experiment the removal of se iv and se vi with an initial selenium concentration of 400 μg l 1 were studied as function of given ph and the graph is plotted as ph against removal efficiency similarly the surface property of alfe mixed oxide was also studied with the zeta potential measurement and the point of zero charge of the adsorbent was determined the point of zero charge is also known as isoelectric point whereas measurement of zeta potential as a function of ph indicates the surface charge of the adsorbent normally for anions such as selenate or selenite the adsorption is observed below the pzc of the adsorbent and hence this parameter is important to illustrate the performance of adsorbent under different ph conditions 7 16 fig 9a and b show the results of zeta potential study of alfe mixed oxide and ph adsorption results obtained for se iv and se vi removal with 0 1 g l 1 dose of the adsorbent and initial selenium concentration of 400 μg l 1 respectively the pzc of the alfe mixed oxide was observed at ph 8 3 and with the increasing ph surface charge on alfe mixed oxide changes from positive to negative beyond pzc the effect of initial ph in the range of 5 9 was measured for se iv and se vi the results indicate that for both se iv and se vi species the removal was more than 95 in the ph range of 5 7 and after that at ph 9 the removal for se iv was decreased to 70 and for se vi it was observed to be less than 10 it revealed that adsorbent was effective up to neutral ph and efficiency decreases with increasing alkaline conditions with the increase in ph after pzc the adsorbent surface becomes negatively charged which results in a reduction in adsorption efficiency 43 however at ph 9 adsorbent showed more than 60 removal for se iv compared to se vi which is less than 10 this shows the suitability of alfe mixed oxide for se iv removal in weakly basic environments 3 2 2 adsorbent selection adsorption experiments are a key factor to access the efficiency of the selected adsorbent and this is the major objective for the proposed study in the process of adsorbent selection based on the previous report adsorbent selection experiment was performed as stated earlier the synthesized adsorbent i e alfe mixed oxide was calcined at different calcination temperatures the calcined samples of alfe mixed oxide are labeled as namely af 300 af 500 af 700 and af 900 as per the calcination temperatures a preliminary screening batch experiment was performed with the adsorbent synthesized at different calcination temperatures fig 10 shows adsorption experiment results with initial se vi ions concentration 400 μg l 1 and adsorbent dose as 0 1 g l 1 0 5 g l 1 and 1 g l 1 for the selected samples of alfe mixed oxide adsorbent fig 10a indicates the adsorption results of alfe mixed oxide calcined at 300 c the adsorbent dose of 0 1 g l 1 0 5 g l 1 and 1 0 g l 1 reduced the initial se vi ions concentration to meet the who guideline value within the first 10 min of the reaction and attains equilibrium below 40 μg l 1 selenium concentration fig 10b shows the results of alfe mixed oxide calcined at 500 c the initial selenium concentration of 400 μg l 1 reduced to less than 40 μg l 1 within 30 min of the adsorption experiment with a dose of 0 5 g l 1 and 1 g l 1 with approximately 95 and 97 removal efficiency respectively was observed during the 8 h of adsorption experiment however in the case of alfe mixed oxide calcined at 700 c and 900 c decreased adsorption efficiency was observed fig 10c shows that the dose of 1 0 g l 1 was capable to remove 90 se ions from the solution and the same dose of alfe mixed oxide calcined at 900 c roughly able to reduce se ions to nearly 73 fig 10d these adsorption experiment results indicate that the af 300 sample adsorbent exhibits threefold highest removal efficiency compared to the other alfe mixed oxides the observed higher efficiency indicates the presence of a greater number of adsorption sites due to the highly defective nature of the ferrihydrite phase in this adsorbent 53 54 as the calcination temperature increases the crystallinity of the material increases with phase transition towards hematite and it could be the possible reason for the reduction in se ions removal hence for the further detailed adsorption study the alfe mixed oxide calcined at 300 c was chosen and further it is referred to as alfe mixed oxide adsorbent 3 2 3 adsorption experiment results the detailed adsorption experiments help to improve the implementation of the adsorbent to meet the world health organization guideline value 40 μg l 1 for selenium in drinking water the present study involves the adsorption experiments for alfe mixed oxide adsorbent to understand the adsorption characteristics of the adsorbent for se iv and se vi ions in aqueous solutions fig 11 depicts the screening experiment results of alfe mixed oxide adsorbent with different adsorbent doses and initial selenium ion concentrations at different contact times fig 11a and c show adsorbent dose screening results of alfe mixed oxide adsorbent with 400 μgl 1 initial se iv and se vi concentration respectively at four contact times as 10 min 30 min 60 min and 180 min at a different dose of the adsorbent 0 01 0 05 0 1 0 5 and 1 0 g l 1 fig 11a results describe the se iv adsorption results at different contact times for se iv adsorption the dose of 0 01 g l 1 showed more than 50 adsorption at 10 min intervals as the dose of the adsorbent increases the adsorption efficiency increases adsorbent dose of 0 1 g l 1 showed more than 90 se iv adsorption within the first 30 min of the reaction to reach below the who guideline value i e 40 μg l 1 however for the higher dose like 0 5 and 1 0 g l 1 of the adsorbent the adsorption process is much faster as it shows more than 95 removal efficiency within the first few minutes of the reaction fig 8c shows adsorption data of se vi removal with initial 400 μg l 1 concentration the trend is similar to se iv adsorption for the dose of 0 01 g l 1 of alfe mixed oxide initially 25 se vi adsorption observed but for 0 1 g l 1 dose of alfe mixed oxide more than 90 removal efficiency was observed and reaches below the who guideline value the results presented that alfe mixed oxide is an efficient adsorbent for both se iv and se vi ions with an optimized adsorbent dose of 0 1 g l 1 fig 11b and d show results of different selenium concentrations at different contact times for the 0 1 g l 1 dose of the adsorbent this result showed the effect of concentration of different adsorbate on the se removal efficiency of the adsorbent based on the dose study observations 0 1 g l 1 dose was fixed for the experiment and samples were collected at different time intervals as 10 min 30 min 60 min and 180 min for both se iv and se vi concentrations respectively at low initial se concentrations up to 300 μg l 1 fig 11c efficient adsorption was observed to meet the who guideline value within 10 min of the contact time for se iv concentration up to 500 μg l 1 0 1 g l 1 dose was found adequate to reduce the initial se iv concentration to meet the who guidelines for drinking water within 60 min of the contact time as observed from fig 11d up to the se vi concentration of 300 μg l 1 the adsorption efficiency of adsorbent at 0 1 g l 1 dose was sufficient to meet who guideline value in 10 min of contact time further after 60 min the who guideline value was met for all se ion concentrations taken in the study fig 11d the results indicate the high adsorption capacities of the adsorbent with high selenium removal efficiencies for both forms of selenium ions these results will be further notionally reinforced in the following section by the assessment of adsorption capacity by adsorption isotherms 3 2 4 adsorption isotherms the adsorption isotherm data was fitted using langmuir 40 freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich d r models by linear regression fit method for se vi and se iv uptake on the surface of alfe mixed oxide adsorbent fig 12 shows the adsorption isotherms for the uptake of se vi from solution the corresponding linear form fitting equation for langmuir freundlich temkin and d r models are given by eq 1 2 3 and 4 respectively 55 1 1 q e 1 q m k l c e 1 q m 2 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e 3 q e rt b ln a t rt b ln c e 4 ε rt ln 1 1 c e the isotherm parameters for se vi adsorption are tabulated in table 1 it can be determined from table 1 that langmuir isotherm model is best fitted plot for the data whereas d r and temkin models are also in moderate agreement the agreement of langmuir isotherm model with the data suggest the homogenous adsorption sites present over the adsorbent surface the theoretical maximum adsorption capacity qm 33 1 mg g 1 obtained from langmuir isotherm data is in agreement with the experimentally obtained value from column adsorption studies 26 57 mg g 1 the value of 1 n obtained from freundlich isotherm is less than 1 and hence supports ordinary sorption process without cooperative adsorption whereases the value of 1 n greater than 1 is indicative of cooperative adsorption 55 the e value obtained from d r model indicates that the surface sites are low energy sites and hence the possible adsorption mechanism may be via physisorption 55 the heat of sorption b value obtained from temkin isotherm also indicate that the adsorbate adsorbent interaction is physisorption with the heat of sorption value of 1 39 j mol 58 fig 13 shows the adsorption isotherms for the uptake of se iv on the surface of alfe mixed oxide adsorbent similar to the adsorption isotherms data fitted for se vi adsorption over alfe mixed oxide surface four adsorption isotherms were used to model the adsorption data for se iv by alfe mixed oxide adsorbent the adsorption isotherm parameters for se iv adsorption are listed in table 2 langmuir and d r models are found to be best fit isotherm models for se iv adsorption while temkin model is also in close agreement with coefficient of determination r2 value of 0 92 the theoretical maximum adsorption capacity qm obtained from langmuir adsorption data is 6 18 mg g 1 which is considerably lower than the one obtained for se vi adsorption this may also indicate the adsorption preference of selenate over selenite for the selected material the value of 1 n obtained from freundlich isotherm data is less than 1 and hence the adsorption is ordinary without cooperative adsorption 55 the e kj mol value obtained from d r model is also indicate that the predominant adsorption mechanism is physisorption 55 the value of heat of sorption b obtained from temkin isotherm also suggest that physisorption is the dominant phenomenon responsible for adsorption of se iv over alfe mixed oxide surface with heat of sorption of 1 046 j mol 58 adsorption kinetics of se iv and se vi adsorption by alfe mixed oxide were also studied as shown in fig 14 the adsorption kinetic results obtained for se iv and se vi were fitted to pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models fig 14 shows the results of the pseudo first order kinetic model for se iv and se vi adsorption and the linear form of this model is given by the lagergren equation eq 5 29 5 log q e q t log q e k 1 2 303 t where qe gives the amount of adsorbate at equilibrium concentration and the amount of adsorbate is given as qt adsorbed at time t mg g 1 for pseudo first order reaction k1 is the equilibrium rate constant and the plot of log qe qt with respect to time t provides the rate constants the parameters obtained for pseudo first order fittings are mentioned in table 3 the obtained results signify that the results do not correlate with the pseudo first order kinetic model the very poor fitting of correlation coefficients indicates that the adsorption rate does not depend on the concentration of adsorbate in the solution 29 fig 14 also shows the results of the pseudo second order kinetic model plotted as time t vs t qt to determine the rate constant k2 and qe values and this model is given by eq 6 42 6 t q t 1 k 2 q e 1 q e t where k2 is the rate constant for pseudo second order adsorption given by g mg min units the intercept and slope of t vs t qt plot give values for k2 and qe respectively table 2 provides the information of pseudo second order fitting parameters the kinetic data of the alfe mixed oxide fits very well with the pseudo second order model having correlation coefficients close to unity this model assumes the adsorption mechanism to be chemisorption and the adsorption rate is dependent on the adsorption capacity and not on the adsorbate concentration the obtained finding matches well with the literature indicating that the pseudo second order kinetic model was found suitable to kinetic data for mixed oxides of aluminium and iron oxides 7 the literature shows that aluminium oxides show excellent selenium adsorption but with a slow rate of kinetics 16 however hematite shows efficient selenium adsorption and hence the alfe mixed oxide has excellent adsorption properties over the pure aluminium and iron oxides reported in the literature 12 44 elovich and weber morris models were also used to fit the kinetic data for se vi and se iv adsorption elovich model is often used to interpret the adsorption kinetics assuming the surface is heterogenous in nature while weber morris model referred as intraparticle mass diffusion model is used to identify the diffusion mechanism in adsorption process 55 the kinetic dataset fitted by linear regression method does not fit well with these models and they are included in the supplementary section for further discussion fig s2 3 2 5 co existing anions study to understand the performance of selenium adsorption in presence of other coexisting anions in the system by alfe mixed oxide adsorbent experiments were conducted in presence of four coexisting anions fig 15 the coexisting anions behavior was studied with se concentration 400 μg l 1 and the concentration of other anions as cl 1 200 mg l 1 no3 1 50 mg l 1 so4 2 100 mg l 1 f 1 10 mg l 1 with the optimized adsorbent dose as 0 1 g l 1 the presence of chloride nitrate and fluoride does not have a conspicuous effect on the adsorption process of selenium by alfe composite the important thing to notice is that the concentrations of these anions are much higher as high as more than 25 fold to 500 fold than the selenium concentrations though the se removal efficiencies in presence of chloride nitrate and fluoride were 98 2 99 3 and 81 4 respectively it was observed that the presence of monovalent anions such as chloride and nitrate show a positive effect on selenium adsorption thus adsorption efficiency was increased this observation corresponds well with the reported literature 39 usually the occurrence of sulfate has a negative effect on selenium removal due to the similar structural properties of both anions 13 41 sulfate competes with selenium for adsorption and hence the presence of sulfate inhibits selenium adsorption in this experiment the sulfate concentration is very high compared to selenium concentration thus showing the adverse impact on adsorption efficiencies by reducing removal to less than 20 however the comparable sulfate concentration will show less impact on selenium adsorption 3 3 column adsorption study and regeneration after evaluation of alfe mixed oxide adsorbent through batch experiments a fixed bed column experiment was performed a schematic of experimentation is shown in fig 16a comprising a fixed bed with a column inner diameter of 1 cm and height of 3 cm respectively adsorbent pellets of size in the range of 0 5 to 1 0 mm were selected for the experiment and to avoid further pressure drop during experimentation adsorbent beads were mixed with silica beads 0 5 mm size subsequently the column was supported with glass wool at both ends the adsorbent loading of 4 g and bed height 3 cm was maintained the flow rate of the selenium solution 400 μg l 1 and 1200 μg l 1 maintained through a peristaltic pump was 10 ml min 1 0 2 the adsorption experiments were performed with se vi spiked solution flow via a fixed bed column through a peristaltic pump the solution filtered through the column i e output water was collected in receiving tank and simultaneously the samples at the predetermined time intervals were collected for icp oes analysis to analyze the selenium concentration the performance of the alfe mixed oxide column was studied by plotting the breakthrough curve of eluent concentration and volumes of water passed l along with the se loading achieved mg g 1 this graph is distributed in three segments as shown in fig 16b initially selenium solution with se concentration of 400 μg l 1 was passed up to 85 l the adsorption rate and se loading are reliant on the feed concentration of the adsorbate thus it was observed that till 85 l of the feed solution was passed the eluent concentration was less than 40 μg l 1 who guideline limit at this lower selenium concentration the breakthrough will be more extended and to avoid this selenium concentration was increased to threefold of the existing feed concentration to achieve the breakthrough hence further selenium solution with initial concentration as 1200 μg l 1 was passed from the column with the same flow rate and a breakthrough was observed after increasing the feed selenium concentration threefold breakthrough duration was reduced and after passing approximately 25 l of this solution breakthrough was observed additionally to assess whether the column was exhausted or yet have any adsorption capacity for selenium again selenium solution with selenium concentration of 400 μg l 1 was passed up to 30 l the column adsorption capacity after saturation and 50 breakthrough point 62 was found to be 26 57 mg g 1 and 9 5 mg g 1 respectively fig 16 which is quite high for selenium adsorption the breakthrough curve displayed excellent performance for selenium removal from water and it is important for the field application for the adsorbent the curve shows that 4 g of adsorbent was able to easily treat 100 l of se contaminated water 400 μg l 1 to reduce the se concentration below who guideline limit of 40 μg l 1 adsorbent regeneration was also carried out in batch experiments as the desorption of se ions from adsorbent with mild alkali solutions of naoh 0 1 m and performance was analyzed for further reuse of adsorbent the adsorption efficiency was unchanged after 5 cycles of experimentation fig s3 s5 in supplementary information 3 4 comparison of alfe mixed oxide se adsorption capacity with other adsorbents the adsorption capacity of alfe mixed oxide was compared with the reported adsorbents for selenium removal is shown in table 4 the maximum adsorption capacity of alfe mixed oxide adsorbent is relatively higher than the previously reported studies table 3 gives information about the adsorbents dose required for efficient adsorption and concentration of initial se ions employed in the study this table shows that the mixed oxide adsorbent like alfe shows more efficient selenium adsorption compared to the other reported adsorbents such as nano mixed metal oxides nanocomposites and other adsorbents 7 11 13 45 48 59 in summary the results showed that the alfe mixed oxide adsorbent acts as a promising adsorbent for selenium remediation from water and its application could be extended for the removal of other anions by altering the compositions of aluminium and iron precursors 4 conclusion in this study the application of alfe mixed oxide synthesized by the coprecipitation method was evaluated for selenium uptake from water the results displayed excellent adsorption capacity from trace level to higher selenium concentration removal from water with a very low adsorbent dose as 0 1 g l 1 the maximum adsorption capacity of alfe mixed oxide calculated by langmuir freundlich adsorption isotherm model was 6 188 mg g 1 and 33 1 mg g 1 for se iv and se vi respectively the adsorbent showed adsorption over a wide ph range up to ph 9 and coexisting anions like chloride nitrate and fluoride did not hinder the adsorption process while the presence of sulfate severely affected adsorption efficiency the column scale performance of alfe mixed oxide was also analyzed and regeneration of the adsorbent was also performed we observed that alfe mixed oxide could be easily regenerated with mild alkali 0 1 m naoh and performance in consecutive cycles was also maintained hence alfe mixed oxide reported in this study may be used for in field application for selenium removal from contaminated water this adsorbent can also be utilized for the groundwater and surface water selenium removal for drinking water treatment systems to reduce selenium concentration below 40 μg l 1 uncited references 8 40 60 61 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

12883,selenium contamination of water resources has become a potential health risk issue the application of aluminium iron alfe mixed oxide for the rapid adsorption of both selenite iv and selenate vi ions from water was studied the synthesized alfe mixed oxide was characterized to understand the morphological and structural properties batch adsorption experiments were performed to understand the adsorption performance with variable parameters alfe mixed oxide was found as efficient for both selenite iv and selenate vi ion adsorption over a wide ph range up to ph 9 adsorption experiments revealed that the dose of 0 1 g l 1 with an initial selenium concentration of 500 μg l 1 is sufficient to meet the who guideline value within the first 30 min of contact time langmuir temkin and dubinin radushkevich dr adsorption isotherm and pseudo second order kinetics presented better fitting for selenite iv and selenate vi ions with maximum adsorption capacity for se vi and se iv as 33 1 mg g 1 and 6 188 mg g 1 respectively column adsorption and regeneration were also studied to understand the practical applicability of the adsorbent the adsorbent was regenerated using mild alkali and can further be reused without any significant decrease in adsorption efficiency graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords alfe mixed oxide se adsorption regeneration column adsorption 1 introduction selenium se is an essential micronutrient for living organisms at lower concentrations however the excess of se present in the environment is responsible for severe risks and damage to living organisms unwanted se present in environment is a cause of water soil and atmospheric pollution and when se is consumed in excess it shows detrimental health impacts the main reason for the enhanced attention of the scientific community in recent years is increasing evidences of selenium pollution in india as well as in the other parts of the world it is now being considered as emerging pollutant and studied to find better solutions for selenium remediation from water 1 selenium contamination in the environment occurs through natural and anthropogenic sources natural sources of selenium contamination include geogenic contamination the release of se through terrestrial coal deposits weathering of se containing rocks and se enriched soil in the environment 2 3 the anthropogenic contamination of selenium occurs via coal combustion by thermal power plants oil refineries agricultural practices such as the use of fertilizers and mining discharge 4 the mining wastewater contains a higher concentration of selenium ions up to 1000 μg l 1 4 5 selenium occurs in the environment as selenite iv and selenate vi species these are the most prevalent forms of oxyanion inorganic selenium species as both selenite and selenate are soluble in normal environmental conditions selenite exists as major solution species at moderate redox conditions in the soil whereas selenate exists at high redox conditions 6 although soil minerals promptly adsorb selenite species a relatively high concentration of selenate species is usually observed in industrial wastewater which is a major source of anthropogenic contamination of selenium in the environment 7 due to the toxic behavior of selenium the maximum acceptable concentration set by world health organization who is 40 μg l 1 selenium for drinking water and the bureau of indian standards bis guidelines for selenium in the drinking water is 10 μg l 1 10 in india the northwest region is highly affected by selenium contamination of soil and water the groundwater selenium concentration in this region is observed up to 1000 μg l 1 7 8 there are some recent case reports in the northwest region about the selenium toxicity symptoms with dystrophy of fingernails toenails patch hair loss over the scalp increased hair fragility etc 9 this alarming condition accentuate the development of robust and cost effective treatment technologies for selenium removal to meet the drinking water standards the widely applied selenium removal technologies include various processes such as ion exchange reverse osmosis chemical methods ferrihydrites co precipitation adsorption and chemical reduction methods 2 3 the existing technologies are mainly effective for se iv removal and are not able to treat se vi to meet the who guideline value for selenium removal from water hence the treatment technologies for the effective removal of both inorganic selenium species are required the adsorption processes are known for various inorganic pollutant remediations from water this method is widely known for easy operations cost effectiveness environmentally safe process and ability to reduce the contaminants to low levels 7 60 61 hence development of low cost functional adsorbents for efficient removal of se iv and se vi with superior adsorption capacity has immense importance for field applications the recent literature shows various adsorbents reported for selenium removal from water including metal oxides hydroxides carbon and graphene based adsorbents natural clay minerals and oxides nano zero valent iron n zvi has been widely studied for efficient se iv removal applications from water and wastewater it is studied that under acidic conditions the inorganic selenium species tend to adsorb on iron oxides and hydroxides subsequently these oxides control solubility of selenium species in water 3 iron and aluminium oxides are abundant minerals found in the earth s crust these oxides exhibit high surface area and point of zero charge pzc these oxides are indispensable in the transport and mobility of various anionic contaminants in the water and soil 17 these materials are known as efficient adsorbents for pollutant removal from industrial wastewaters and drinking water however metal oxides have gained the attention of researchers in the last few decades due to their wide manufacturing economical and easy applications along with other systems with the increasing application of nanotechnology researchers are focusing on applications of nano metal oxides and their composites for anionic pollutant remediation owing to its large surface area and more active adsorption sites 13 the nanocrystalline forms of metal oxides and hydroxides such as hematite α fe2o3 11 al iii sio2 and fe iii sio2 7 mnp hematite 12 ferrihydrite hematite composite 14 maghemite nano transition alumina γ δ al2o3 15 γ feooh 16 are reported for selenium adsorption from aqueous solutions ferrihydrite is commonly known as amorphous iron oxide or hydrous ferric oxide and is commonly found in the surface environment ferrihydrite is known to have hematite like structure with hexagonal closed packing of oxygen atoms with fe ions in octahedral spaces this form of iron oxide is characterized by its combination of defective and defect free structural units the presence of octahedral sheet with z direction is 2 for feroxyhyte 4 for ferrihydrite and 6 for hematite c 0 46 nm 0 94 nm 1 3752 nm respectively the poor crystallinity of first two forms i e ferrihydrite and feroxyhyte is related to the existing vacant sites of fe in this structure and substitution of these few sites by oxygen oh and or h2o in case of ferrihydrite a variety of compounds with varying structural degree occurs and these compounds are described by the number of broad x ray peaks present in the structure as e g 2 line and 6 line ferrihydrite the composition of ferrihydrite is variable with respect to h2o and oh as the structural water composition may change compared to the suggested formula 18 19 ferrihydrite owing to its amorphous nature with very high surface area are ubiquitous in natural environment and are known as active adsorbent das et al studied the selenate adsorption by three synthetic iron oxy hydroxides i e 2 line ferrihydrite lepidocrocite and goethite the findings showed that 2 line ferrihydrite showed efficient selenate adsorption under near neutral conditions with high surface area 20 peak and sparks reported selenate adsorption mechanism on hematite goethite and hydrous ferric oxide hfo hematite forms inner sphere complexes with selenate however goethite and hfo forms both outer sphere and inner sphere complexes or mixtures of these complexes with selenate 22 experimental conditions like ph ionic strength surface loading plays a vital role in adsorption experiments and impact reaction mechanisms hence the adsorption mechanism of anions on metal oxides should not be only the inner sphere or outer sphere but it can be an intermediate between the outer and inner sphere mechanism 21 22 a comparative study of al2o3 nano al2o3 and chitin adsorbents for selenite adsorption were reported by jegadeesan et al 2003 however the selenate adsorption was not discussed 23 peak 2006 studied the mechanism of selenium ions adsorption on aluminium oxides 17 there are very few reports of ferrihydrite for selenium adsorption from aqueous solutions aluminium and iron mixed oxides or composites for selenium adsorption have not yet been studied reports containing the detailed work and thorough studies including reaction kinetics isotherm and column studies are lacking for selenate adsorption on ferrihydrite considering the field application or practical implementation therefore in the present study aluminium iron mixed oxide of high adsorption efficiency was explored for efficient selenium ions adsorption from water this study involves detailed dose adsorption studies isotherm effect of competing anions and kinetic studies along with continuous flow column experiment strengthening the field applicability of selected adsorbent 2

vacuum degassed using liquid nitrogen at 200 c for 2 h to remove adsorbates and water raman spectra were acquired with dxr raman microscope thermo scientific 256 two second scans were accumulated with laser 532 nm power 3 mw 25 and 50 μm slit and 50 μm pinhole under 10 objective of olympus microscope in full range with distinction of 4 cm 1 the point of zero charge of the sample at different ph conditions ranging from ph 3 to ph 12 was carried out by nanobrook zetapals model 2 4 adsorption experiments selenium adsorption experiments were carried out in 250 ml polypropylene conical flasks with 100 ml selenium solution with duplicate experimental sets the synthesized alfe mixed oxide samples were used as adsorbent to study the selenium ions removal from water the adsorption experiments were carried out at different doses of the adsorbent ph initial selenium ions concentrations contact time for the adsorption experiment and competing behavior with other anions all adsorption

purity selenium standards were used for calibration of the icp oes pre determined concentrations of se iv and se vi were prepared through dilution of the stock solution as per the requirement of a specific experiment the stock solutions were prepared with the addition of a required amount of standard solutions of 1000 μg ml 1 concentration of se iv and se vi all the batch adsorption experiments were performed in an orbital shaker incubator system at 25 c and 150 rpm make remi india se vi and se iv adsorption studies for dose optimization were carried out at pre defined dosages of alfe mixed oxide adsorbent the kinetic study experiments were carried out with a broad range of selenium concentrations 50 500 μg l 1 adsorption experiments were performed with the variation of dose from 0 01 g l 1 to 1 g l 1 the ph study was performed with the optimized dose of adsorbent and initial se iv and se vi concentration of 400 μg l 1 at different ph as 3 5 7 9 and 11 the different ph of the solutions was maintained by the addition of a dilute concentration of 0 1 m hno3 and 0 1 m naoh solutions after completion of the experiment the samples were collected at specific time intervals as per the requirement of the experiment and filtered through a 0 22 μm disposable membrane syringe filter the collected samples were analyzed at icp oes the selenium ion solutions working solutions prepared for each experiment were also analyzed to verify the initial selenium ions concentration adsorption capacity and kinetics of the selected adsorbent for selenium ions adsorption were optimized by isotherms models controls were also employed for analysis to ensure the accuracy of the results ph measurements for each experiment were subsequently carried out with a horiba benchtop multiparameter analyzer model pc1100 s and calibrated with standard buffer solutions 3 point calibration adsorbent regeneration experiments were also performed with different concentrations of mild alkali naoh as 400 and 4000 μg l 1 2 5 zeta potential experiments point of zero charge the zeta potential experiments were performed by preparing the solutions of alfe mixed oxide samples the aqueous

the solution was measured as 6 7 0 2 the ph of the solutions for zeta potential measurement was adjusted by using 0 1 m hno3 and 0 1 m naoh solutions the solutions after ph adjustment were again employed to ultrasonication for 30 min to attain the equilibrium the resulting suspensions ph was again noted and the point of zero charge was determined with the nanobrook zetapals model at room temperature 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of alfe composite 3 1 1 structural analysis the x ray diffraction pattern for alfe samples calcined at 300 c 500 c 700 c and 900 c is shown in fig 1 the alfe samples calcined at 300 c show two broad peaks at 40 and 75 as observed from fig 1 c these peaks indicated amorphosity in the sample however these peaks are matched with a two line ferrihydrite structure icdd file no 00 029 0712 these are hydrous ferric oxide structures with hexagonal symmetry belonging to the p63mc space group aluminium was easily doped in this structure as aluminium is well known to form an isostructural p63mc space group phase of oxyhydroxide named akdalaite as the calcination temperature was increased from 300 c to 500 c the hematite crystal phase started crystallizing along with the ferrihydrite phase as indicated in fig 1 d at 700 c the ferrihydrite phase completely disappeared fig 1 e with the formation of only the hematite phase fe2o3 with rhombohedral crystal system icdd file no 00 024 0072 individual alumina phases were not observed in the sample till the 700 c calcination temperature which indicated aluminium metal was doped or distributed throughout the hematite structure while hematite crystallized in the rhombohedral system with r3 c space group corundum is the commonly and naturally occurring mineral of alumina which crystallizes into a trigonal structure with r3 c space group some authors may consider the trigonal and rhombohedral crystal systems as the same but they are not equivalent some with trigonal symmetry may also belong to the hexagonal lattice as alumina and hematite belong to a similar space group with a similar crystal structure the formation of mixed metal oxide homogenous in aluminium and iron content throughout the lattice is highly probable formation of hematite by dehydration of iron hydroxide fe oh 3 g298 15 378 1 kcal mol is thermodynamically more favourable than that of corundum g298 15 177 7 kcal mol hence observed dominantly in xrd standard free energy change of dehydration for hematite is lower than that of corundum 30 31 al substitution in hematite decreases all unit cell parameters towards corundum as well as the synthetic temperature affects the unit cell length of hematite the substitution of al3 in hematite structure induces strain in the ordered structure as alo bonds are shorter compared to feo which might greatly hinder long range crystal formation and hence amorphous nanocrystalline structure was obtained for alfe samples calcined at lower temperatures the presence of oh group in vacant sites also induces strain as all the three hydrogen atoms are not necessarily present in a single octahedron of o2 surrounding fe atom but the presence of such oh groups had not been determined although it is fairly reasonable to assume their presence at higher calcination temperature 700 c in case of hematite oh groups present on the surface of the structure are evaporated as water molecules with the increase in temperature protons within the lattice diffused to the surface to be driven off as water molecules which leads to fe3 enrichment at the surface the resulting charge imbalance in the bulk material creates a driving force for fe3 diffusion inside the lattice from the surface to compensate for the positive charge deficiency due to proton diffusion to the surface 30 however fe diffusion only starts above tamman temperature which is approximately half of the melting point for hematite m p of hematite 1565 c hence long range ordered lattice formation is favoured above this temperature which agrees with the experimental fact that ordered hematite structure is observed only above 700 c from xrd 32 33 the presence of fe3 ions at the surface also acts as cation adsorption sites for se vi ions and hence alfe material is expected to show superior adsorption capacity as the calcination temperature is further increased to 900 c a few peaks of corundum started to appear as an impurity as shown in fig 1 f this phase segregation occurred due to thermodynamic feasibility achieved at this high temperature fig 1 3 1 2 raman spectroscopy raman spectroscopy detects the frequency shift caused by inelastic scattering of radiation interacting with molecules 49 the monochromatic laser light interacts with vibrational modes in a crystal lattice called phonons 50 if the molecules scatter monochromatic radiation without changing their wavelength it is called elastic scattering rayleigh scattering on the contrary if the wavelength of incident light changes its wavelength it is called inelastic scattering raman scattering it is the difference between elastic and inelastic scattering that is measured in raman spectroscopy 51 52 the energy of inelastic scattering varies with changing vibrational mode of crystal lattice resulting in a frequency shift in raman spectroscopy which is specific for each mineral 28 fig 2 shows raman spectra of alumina iron mixed oxide af calcined at 300 c 500 c 700 c 900 c respectively af 300 af 500 af 700 af 900 pure iron oxide fe 300 and aluminium oxide al 300 calcined at 300 c it was observed that the pure fe 300 sample shows characteristic peaks at 219 286 403 489 605 and 1312 cm 1 the characteristic peaks indicated the formation of the hematite phase and these peaks disappear after the addition of aluminium to the structure for the af 300 sample however at higher calcination temperatures 500 700 and 900 c peaks corresponding to pure fe 300 started to appear again al 300 showed characteristic peaks of corundum phase at 353 489 675 and 1044 cm 1 which were not observed in the case of mixed oxide material from the results it was seen that the synthesized material contains a dominant phase of iron while aluminium was homogeneously doped in the iron oxide oxyhydroxide structure as reported by nesheva et al intensity of the raman scattering band decreases and their full width half maxima fwhm increases with the increasing disorder in the crystal structure as well with decreasing particle size raman spectra exhibit much sharper peaks for particles having larger size 100 nm while decreasing particle size increases peak broadness which is due to the phonon confinement effect 24 25 the model phonon confinement is based on the fact that only the phonon near to brillouin zone contributes to raman spectra where q 0 q is defined as the given wave vector for which oscillatory wave motion of atoms around their equilibrium position is described by system of 3 n equations q 0 near brillouin zone because of conservation of momentum between the incident light and phonons and so peaks are sharp while finite crystal phonons are confined by crystal boundaries and defects this results in the uncertainty of phonon momentum where phonons with q 0 also give rise to spectra causing peak broadening a well crystallized sample with micrometre grain size is treated as an infinite crystal for all practical purposes while the effect of phonon confinement is noticeable in vibration spectra only when the grain size is smaller than 20 lattice parameters 26 for af 300 spectra where alumina was doped in fe structure no sharp peaks were observed this was also an indication of the formation of nanocrystals further the broad band at 716 cm 1 indicated the presence of a 2 line ferrihydrite phase in this sample the difference between af 300 and fe 300 spectra was sharply in contrast while both materials were synthesized with the same method af 300 contained additional al doped into the fe structure the addition of al to the material restricts crystal growth to nanocrystalline size and increases disorder in the structure and hence only a broad peak at 716 cm 1 was observed however as calcination temperature was increased it resulted in increased crystallinity as also observed from xrd raman peaks corresponding to that of fe 300 structure start to appear in the spectra of af 500 af 700 and af 900 fe 300 sample shows characteristic peaks for hematite structure as supported from the literature 27 28 the reported literature contains visible raman bands at 225 291 411 500 611 and 1321 cm 1 corresponding to 219 286 403 489 605 and 1312 cm 1 for fe 300 material it may also be noticed that all the peaks in fe 300 structure were shifted towards lower energy which may be associated with the presence of impurities in the structure if the crystal has strained bonds then the atoms are pulled apart resulting in the increased chemical bond length as the chemical bond increases and the force constant remains the same the vibrational frequency decreases the characteristic peak for ferrihydrite structure at 710 cm 1 was not observed while major peaks for hematite structure were observed seven phonon lines are expected in the raman spectrum of hematite as it belongs to the d3d space group and 2 ag1 modes and five eg modes at 225 247 293 299 412 498 and 613 cm 1 the 293 and 299 cm 1 bands are only resolved at 100 k and hence indistinguishable at room temperature or may appear as a shoulder at 293 cm 1 the intense band at 1314 cm 1 was assigned to two magnon scattering which originate due to the antiferromagnetic nature of hematite tem images also further support the nanocrystalline nature of the sample where small 5 10 nm particles were aggregated to form larger particles these raman results were well supported by the xrd results 3 1 3 surface area measurements the specific surface area for alfe mixed oxide 300 sample was estimated to be as high as 155 4 m2 g with pore volume 0 43 cm3 g and pore diameter of 10 3 nm as derived from bet bjh plot fig 3 the adsorption isotherms illustrate the adsorption behavior of the materials the shape of the adsorption desorption isotherm as shown in the fig 3 bear a resemblance to a type iv isotherm with the presence of distinguishing hysteresis loop in the multilayer range 56 these results indicate the porous adsorbent nature with pores generally ranging from 1 5 100 nm af 300 was mesoporous in nature and specific surface area was way higher than that of synthetic hematite at high pressure the increase in adsorbate is observed as the pores get filled and the inflection point is generally observed near completion of the first monolayer 57 this high surface area increases exposure to adsorption sites and contributes to the higher adsorption capacity of the sample 3 1 4 sem and tem analysis fig 4a c shows scanning electron micrographs for pure alumina particles are highly aggregated and form a gelatinous matrix fig 4d f shows sem micrographs of pure iron oxide irregular shaped particles are observed while upon higher magnification smaller particles seem to aggregate to form larger particles with dimensions in the range of 50 150 nm fig 4g i show sem micrographs for synthesized af 300 the particle morphology is found in between that of pure alumina and red oxide the particle dimensions are in the range of 20 50 nm which is much smaller than the previously observed size for iron oxide particles spherical particles were observed aggregated together or embedded in the gelatinous matrix the smaller particle size is attributed to aluminium addition which restricts crystal growth tem micrographs and saed pattern of af 300 sample are shown in fig 5 it is observed that each particle observed in fig 5g i is made of small spherical aggregates contrary to the observation in the previous study where the addition of al to hematite structure resulted in the formation of nanoflakes or disk like structure where crystal growth was restricted to only one phase the observed particles are cubic to spherical with smooth edges 33 the selected area electron diffraction saed pattern of the af 300 sample is shown in fig 5 c and f the saed pattern indicates the polycrystalline nature of the material additionally in the saed pattern that fewer diffraction spots confirm the two line ferrihydrite phase as indicated by xrd analysis also fig 6a c shows hrtem images of the af 300 sample the lattice spacing observed in individual nanospheres of 2 5 å corresponds to the 110 crystalline plane of ferrihydrite structure the 110 200 and 106 planes are the dominant planes observed for ferrihydrite structure in xrd with high intensities icdd 00 029 0712 observation of these planes in hr tem images corresponding to the ferrihydrite crystalline phase in the af 300 sample indicated the presence of ferrihydrite nanocrystal in the sample xrd data also confirmed the same with observed diffraction lines 3 1 5 elemental analysis the elemental composition of the as synthesized af 300 sample was mapped using energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds the eds spectra is as shown in fig 7 a b and c respectively the elemental composition of fe and al was found to be 1 0 49 the distribution of iron and aluminium was found completely uniform throughout the samples indicating uniform aluminium doping over ferrihydrite structure 3 1 6 xps analysis the evaluation of chemical shifts in binding energies bes originating from the different chemical environments of the same energy level is a commonly and extentensively used method for the determination of the oxidation state of metal in metal oxides the survey scan of af 300 sample shows the presence of fe al and o as observed from fig 8a the atomic percent of individual atoms observed from survey scan of xps are found in agreement with the ferrihydrite structure fe10o14 oh 2 fe5o7 oh fe5o8h 4h2o fe2o3 0 5h2o where fe is found 33 while oxygen contributes 63 it has also been observed that aluminium is present in structure where 13 of the total iron is replaced by aluminium two characteristic 2p 3 2 and 2p 1 2 bands were observed in high resolution xps spectra of iron as shown in fig 8b a typical satellite peak for α fe2o3 is also observed at a binding energy of 718 8 ev 35 36 the deconvoluted spectra of fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 show the presence of two types of fe species the determination of 2 line ferrihydrite structure is inherently difficult because of its amorphous nature and nanocrystallite size however recent endeavours have thrown some light on its structure with the help of reverse monte carlo refinement rmc and pair distribution modelling pdf it was concluded that single phase akdalite like ferrihydrite model is most probable ruling out the possibility of multi phase structure mixture of defective and defect free ferrihydrite nanocrystals along with uniformly dispersed hematite 37 the single phase ferrihydrite structure consists of tetrahedrally feo4 and octahedrally feo6 coordinated iron species which is also evident from high resolution xps spectra of iron 2p where deconvoluted spectra shows presence of two types of species ferrihydrite in its ideal form should contain 20 of feo4 and 80 feo6 polyhedra but the occupancy of fe sites changes with change in the particle size resulting in the increased disorder of the structure the ratio of tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated iron species varies and may be present from 0 40 in sample 38 in the synthesized samples tetrahedral fe was found 37 fe3 present in ferrihydrite is in high spin state as o2 ligand does not have the ability to split crystal field of octahedrally coordinated species to limit the d electron in the spin paired state as evident from the fig 8b since low spin compounds are unable to undergo multiplet splitting and only a single peak may be observed 34 only fe3 species should be present in the ideal hematite structure while multiplet peaks were observed in the xps spectra and hence the af 300 sample is assumed to take form of disordered ferrihydrite than the stable hematite structure 3 2 selenium adsorption experiments 3 2 1 ph adsorption study the adsorption process is mainly dependent on the ph of the solution and this study is an important parameter for the field application of the adsorbent hence to determine the performance of alfe mixed oxide different ph solutions were optimized for selenium adsorption in this experiment the removal of se iv and se vi with an initial selenium concentration of 400 μg l 1 were studied as function of given ph and the graph is plotted as ph against removal efficiency similarly the surface property of alfe mixed oxide was also studied with the zeta potential measurement and the point of zero charge of the adsorbent was determined the point of zero charge is also known as isoelectric point whereas measurement of zeta potential as a function of ph indicates the surface charge of the adsorbent normally for anions such as selenate or selenite the adsorption is observed below the pzc of the adsorbent and hence this parameter is important to illustrate the performance of adsorbent under different ph conditions 7 16 fig 9a and b show the results of zeta potential study of alfe mixed oxide and ph adsorption results obtained for se iv and se vi removal with 0 1 g l 1 dose of the adsorbent and initial selenium concentration of 400 μg l 1 respectively the pzc of the alfe mixed oxide was observed at ph 8 3 and with the increasing ph surface charge on alfe mixed oxide changes from positive to negative beyond pzc the effect of initial ph in the range of 5 9 was measured for se iv and se vi the results indicate that for both se iv and se vi species the removal was more than 95 in the ph range of 5 7 and after that at ph 9 the removal for se iv was decreased to 70 and for se vi it was observed to be less than 10 it revealed that adsorbent was effective up to neutral ph and efficiency decreases with increasing alkaline conditions with the increase in ph after pzc the adsorbent surface becomes negatively charged which results in a reduction in adsorption efficiency 43 however at ph 9 adsorbent showed more than 60 removal for se iv compared to se vi which is less than 10 this shows the suitability of alfe mixed oxide for se iv removal in weakly basic environments 3 2 2 adsorbent selection adsorption experiments are a key factor to access the efficiency of the selected adsorbent and this is the major objective for the proposed study in the process of adsorbent selection based on the previous report adsorbent selection experiment was performed as stated earlier the synthesized adsorbent i e alfe mixed oxide was calcined at different calcination temperatures the calcined samples of alfe mixed oxide are labeled as namely af 300 af 500 af 700 and af 900 as per the calcination temperatures a preliminary screening batch experiment was performed with the adsorbent synthesized at different calcination temperatures fig 10 shows adsorption experiment results with initial se vi ions concentration 400 μg l 1 and adsorbent dose as 0 1 g l 1 0 5 g l 1 and 1 g l 1 for the selected samples of alfe mixed oxide adsorbent fig 10a indicates the adsorption results of alfe mixed oxide calcined at 300 c the adsorbent dose of 0 1 g l 1 0 5 g l 1 and 1 0 g l 1 reduced the initial se vi ions concentration to meet the who guideline value within the first 10 min of the reaction and attains equilibrium below 40 μg l 1 selenium concentration fig 10b shows the results of alfe mixed oxide calcined at 500 c the initial selenium concentration of 400 μg l 1 reduced to less than 40 μg l 1 within 30 min of the adsorption experiment with a dose of 0 5 g l 1 and 1 g l 1 with approximately 95 and 97 removal efficiency respectively was observed during the 8 h of adsorption experiment however in the case of alfe mixed oxide calcined at 700 c and 900 c decreased adsorption efficiency was observed fig 10c shows that the dose of 1 0 g l 1 was capable to remove 90 se ions from the solution and the same dose of alfe mixed oxide calcined at 900 c roughly able to reduce se ions to nearly 73 fig 10d these adsorption experiment results indicate that the af 300 sample adsorbent exhibits threefold highest removal efficiency compared to the other alfe mixed oxides the observed higher efficiency indicates the presence of a greater number of adsorption sites due to the highly defective nature of the ferrihydrite phase in this adsorbent 53 54 as the calcination temperature increases the crystallinity of the material increases with phase transition towards hematite and it could be the possible reason for the reduction in se ions removal hence for the further detailed adsorption study the alfe mixed oxide calcined at 300 c was chosen and further it is referred to as alfe mixed oxide adsorbent 3 2 3 adsorption experiment results the detailed adsorption experiments help to improve the implementation of the adsorbent to meet the world health organization guideline value 40 μg l 1 for selenium in drinking water the present study involves the adsorption experiments for alfe mixed oxide adsorbent to understand the adsorption characteristics of the adsorbent for se iv and se vi ions in aqueous solutions fig 11 depicts the screening experiment results of alfe mixed oxide adsorbent with different adsorbent doses and initial selenium ion concentrations at different contact times fig 11a and c show adsorbent dose screening results of alfe mixed oxide adsorbent with 400 μgl 1 initial se iv and se vi concentration respectively at four contact times as 10 min 30 min 60 min and 180 min at a different dose of the adsorbent 0 01 0 05 0 1 0 5 and 1 0 g l 1 fig 11a results describe the se iv adsorption results at different contact times for se iv adsorption the dose of 0 01 g l 1 showed more than 50 adsorption at 10 min intervals as the dose of the adsorbent increases the adsorption efficiency increases adsorbent dose of 0 1 g l 1 showed more than 90 se iv adsorption within the first 30 min of the reaction to reach below the who guideline value i e 40 μg l 1 however for the higher dose like 0 5 and 1 0 g l 1 of the adsorbent the adsorption process is much faster as it shows more than 95 removal efficiency within the first few minutes of the reaction fig 8c shows adsorption data of se vi removal with initial 400 μg l 1 concentration the trend is similar to se iv adsorption for the dose of 0 01 g l 1 of alfe mixed oxide initially 25 se vi adsorption observed but for 0 1 g l 1 dose of alfe mixed oxide more than 90 removal efficiency was observed and reaches below the who guideline value the results presented that alfe mixed oxide is an efficient adsorbent for both se iv and se vi ions with an optimized adsorbent dose of 0 1 g l 1 fig 11b and d show results of different selenium concentrations at different contact times for the 0 1 g l 1 dose of the adsorbent this result showed the effect of concentration of different adsorbate on the se removal efficiency of the adsorbent based on the dose study observations 0 1 g l 1 dose was fixed for the experiment and samples were collected at different time intervals as 10 min 30 min 60 min and 180 min for both se iv and se vi concentrations respectively at low initial se concentrations up to 300 μg l 1 fig 11c efficient adsorption was observed to meet the who guideline value within 10 min of the contact time for se iv concentration up to 500 μg l 1 0 1 g l 1 dose was found adequate to reduce the initial se iv concentration to meet the who guidelines for drinking water within 60 min of the contact time as observed from fig 11d up to the se vi concentration of 300 μg l 1 the adsorption efficiency of adsorbent at 0 1 g l 1 dose was sufficient to meet who guideline value in 10 min of contact time further after 60 min the who guideline value was met for all se ion concentrations taken in the study fig 11d the results indicate the high adsorption capacities of the adsorbent with high selenium removal efficiencies for both forms of selenium ions these results will be further notionally reinforced in the following section by the assessment of adsorption capacity by adsorption isotherms 3 2 4 adsorption isotherms the adsorption isotherm data was fitted using langmuir 40 freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich d r models by linear regression fit method for se vi and se iv uptake on the surface of alfe mixed oxide adsorbent fig 12 shows the adsorption isotherms for the uptake of se vi from solution the corresponding linear form fitting equation for langmuir freundlich temkin and d r models are given by eq 1 2 3 and 4 respectively 55 1 1 q e 1 q m k l c e 1 q m 2 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e 3 q e rt b ln a t rt b ln c e 4 ε rt ln 1 1 c e the isotherm parameters for se vi adsorption are tabulated in table 1 it can be determined from table 1 that langmuir isotherm model is best fitted plot for the data whereas d r and temkin models are also in moderate agreement the agreement of langmuir isotherm model with the data suggest the homogenous adsorption sites present over the adsorbent surface the theoretical maximum adsorption capacity qm 33 1 mg g 1 obtained from langmuir isotherm data is in agreement with the experimentally obtained value from column adsorption studies 26 57 mg g 1 the value of 1 n obtained from freundlich isotherm is less than 1 and hence supports ordinary sorption process without cooperative adsorption whereases the value of 1 n greater than 1 is indicative of cooperative adsorption 55 the e value obtained from d r model indicates that the surface sites are low energy sites and hence the possible adsorption mechanism may be via physisorption 55 the heat of sorption b value obtained from temkin isotherm also indicate that the adsorbate adsorbent interaction is physisorption with the heat of sorption value of 1 39 j mol 58 fig 13 shows the adsorption isotherms for the uptake of se iv on the surface of alfe mixed oxide adsorbent similar to the adsorption isotherms data fitted for se vi adsorption over alfe mixed oxide surface four adsorption isotherms were used to model the adsorption data for se iv by alfe mixed oxide adsorbent the adsorption isotherm parameters for se iv adsorption are listed in table 2 langmuir and d r models are found to be best fit isotherm models for se iv adsorption while temkin model is also in close agreement with coefficient of determination r2 value of 0 92 the theoretical maximum adsorption capacity qm obtained from langmuir adsorption data is 6 18 mg g 1 which is considerably lower than the one obtained for se vi adsorption this may also indicate the adsorption preference of selenate over selenite for the selected material the value of 1 n obtained from freundlich isotherm data is less than 1 and hence the adsorption is ordinary without cooperative adsorption 55 the e kj mol value obtained from d r model is also indicate that the predominant adsorption mechanism is physisorption 55 the value of heat of sorption b obtained from temkin isotherm also suggest that physisorption is the dominant phenomenon responsible for adsorption of se iv over alfe mixed oxide surface with heat of sorption of 1 046 j mol 58 adsorption kinetics of se iv and se vi adsorption by alfe mixed oxide were also studied as shown in fig 14 the adsorption kinetic results obtained for se iv and se vi were fitted to pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models fig 14 shows the results of the pseudo first order kinetic model for se iv and se vi adsorption and the linear form of this model is given by the lagergren equation eq 5 29 5 log q e q t log q e k 1 2 303 t where qe gives the amount of adsorbate at equilibrium concentration and the amount of adsorbate is given as qt adsorbed at time t mg g 1 for pseudo first order reaction k1 is the equilibrium rate constant and the plot of log qe qt with respect to time t provides the rate constants the parameters obtained for pseudo first order fittings are mentioned in table 3 the obtained results signify that the results do not correlate with the pseudo first order kinetic model the very poor fitting of correlation coefficients indicates that the adsorption rate does not depend on the concentration of adsorbate in the solution 29 fig 14 also shows the results of the pseudo second order kinetic model plotted as time t vs t qt to determine the rate constant k2 and qe values and this model is given by eq 6 42 6 t q t 1 k 2 q e 1 q e t where k2 is the rate constant for pseudo second order adsorption given by g mg min units the intercept and slope of t vs t qt plot give values for k2 and qe respectively table 2 provides the information of pseudo second order fitting parameters the kinetic data of the alfe mixed oxide fits very well with the pseudo second order model having correlation coefficients close to unity this model assumes the adsorption mechanism to be chemisorption and the adsorption rate is dependent on the adsorption capacity and not on the adsorbate concentration the obtained finding matches well with the literature indicating that the pseudo second order kinetic model was found suitable to kinetic data for mixed oxides of aluminium and iron oxides 7 the literature shows that aluminium oxides show excellent selenium adsorption but with a slow rate of kinetics 16 however hematite shows efficient selenium adsorption and hence the alfe mixed oxide has excellent adsorption properties over the pure aluminium and iron oxides reported in the literature 12 44 elovich and weber morris models were also used to fit the kinetic data for se vi and se iv adsorption elovich model is often used to interpret the adsorption kinetics assuming the surface is heterogenous in nature while weber morris model referred as intraparticle mass diffusion model is used to identify the diffusion mechanism in adsorption process 55 the kinetic dataset fitted by linear regression method does not fit well with these models and they are included in the supplementary section for further discussion fig s2 3 2 5 co existing anions study to understand the performance of selenium adsorption in presence of other coexisting anions in the system by alfe mixed oxide adsorbent experiments were conducted in presence of four coexisting anions fig 15 the coexisting anions behavior was studied with se concentration 400 μg l 1 and the concentration of other anions as cl 1 200 mg l 1 no3 1 50 mg l 1 so4 2 100 mg l 1 f 1 10 mg l 1 with the optimized adsorbent dose as 0 1 g l 1 the presence of chloride nitrate and fluoride does not have a conspicuous effect on the adsorption process of selenium by alfe composite the important thing to notice is that the concentrations of these anions are much higher as high as more than 25 fold to 500 fold than the selenium concentrations though the se removal efficiencies in presence of chloride nitrate and fluoride were 98 2 99 3 and 81 4 respectively it was observed that the presence of monovalent anions such as chloride and nitrate show a positive effect on selenium adsorption thus adsorption efficiency was increased this observation corresponds well with the reported literature 39 usually the occurrence of sulfate has a negative effect on selenium removal due to the similar structural properties of both anions 13 41 sulfate competes with selenium for adsorption and hence the presence of sulfate inhibits selenium adsorption in this experiment the sulfate concentration is very high compared to selenium concentration thus showing the adverse impact on adsorption efficiencies by reducing removal to less than 20 however the comparable sulfate concentration will show less impact on selenium adsorption 3 3 column adsorption study and regeneration after evaluation of alfe mixed oxide adsorbent through batch experiments a fixed bed column experiment was performed a schematic of experimentation is shown in fig 16a comprising a fixed bed with a column inner diameter of 1 cm and height of 3 cm respectively adsorbent pellets of size in the range of 0 5 to 1 0 mm were selected for the experiment and to avoid further pressure drop during experimentation adsorbent beads were mixed with silica beads 0 5 mm size subsequently the column was supported with glass wool at both ends the adsorbent loading of 4 g and bed height 3 cm was maintained the flow rate of the selenium solution 400 μg l 1 and 1200 μg l 1 maintained through a peristaltic pump was 10 ml min 1 0 2 the adsorption experiments were performed with se vi spiked solution flow via a fixed bed column through a peristaltic pump the solution filtered through the column i e output water was collected in receiving tank and simultaneously the samples at the predetermined time intervals were collected for icp oes analysis to analyze the selenium concentration the performance of the alfe mixed oxide column was studied by plotting the breakthrough curve of eluent concentration and volumes of water passed l along with the se loading achieved mg g 1 this graph is distributed in three segments as shown in fig 16b initially selenium solution with se concentration of 400 μg l 1 was passed up to 85 l the adsorption rate and se loading are reliant on the feed concentration of the adsorbate thus it was observed that till 85 l of the feed solution was passed the eluent concentration was less than 40 μg l 1 who guideline limit at this lower selenium concentration the breakthrough will be more extended and to avoid this selenium concentration was increased to threefold of the existing feed concentration to achieve the breakthrough hence further selenium solution with initial concentration as 1200 μg l 1 was passed from the column with the same flow rate and a breakthrough was observed after increasing the feed selenium concentration threefold breakthrough duration was reduced and after passing approximately 25 l of this solution breakthrough was observed additionally to assess whether the column was exhausted or yet have any adsorption capacity for selenium again selenium solution with selenium concentration of 400 μg l 1 was passed up to 30 l the column adsorption capacity after saturation and 50 breakthrough point 62 was found to be 26 57 mg g 1 and 9 5 mg g 1 respectively fig 16 which is quite high for selenium adsorption the breakthrough curve displayed excellent performance for selenium removal from water and it is important for the field application for the adsorbent the curve shows that 4 g of adsorbent was able to easily treat 100 l of se contaminated water 400 μg l 1 to reduce the se concentration below who guideline limit of 40 μg l 1 adsorbent regeneration was also carried out in batch experiments as the desorption of se ions from adsorbent with mild alkali solutions of naoh 0 1 m and performance was analyzed for further reuse of adsorbent the adsorption efficiency was unchanged after 5 cycles of experimentation fig s3 s5 in supplementary information 3 4 comparison of alfe mixed oxide se adsorption capacity with other adsorbents the adsorption capacity of alfe mixed oxide was compared with the reported adsorbents for selenium removal is shown in table 4 the maximum adsorption capacity of alfe mixed oxide adsorbent is relatively higher than the previously reported studies table 3 gives information about the adsorbents dose required for efficient adsorption and concentration of initial se ions employed in the study this table shows that the mixed oxide adsorbent like alfe shows more efficient selenium adsorption compared to the other reported adsorbents such as nano mixed metal oxides nanocomposites and other adsorbents 7 11 13 45 48 59 in summary the results showed that the alfe mixed oxide adsorbent acts as a promising adsorbent for selenium remediation from water and its application could be extended for the removal of other anions by altering the compositions of aluminium and iron precursors 4 conclusion in this study the application of alfe mixed oxide synthesized by the coprecipitation method was evaluated for selenium uptake from water the results displayed excellent adsorption capacity from trace level to higher selenium concentration removal from water with a very low adsorbent dose as 0 1 g l 1 the maximum adsorption capacity of alfe mixed oxide calculated by langmuir freundlich adsorption isotherm model was 6 188 mg g 1 and 33 1 mg g 1 for se iv and se vi respectively the adsorbent showed adsorption over a wide ph range up to ph 9 and coexisting anions like chloride nitrate and fluoride did not hinder the adsorption process while the presence of sulfate severely affected adsorption efficiency the column scale performance of alfe mixed oxide was also analyzed and regeneration of the adsorbent was also performed we observed that alfe mixed oxide could be easily regenerated with mild alkali 0 1 m naoh and performance in consecutive cycles was also maintained hence alfe mixed oxide reported in this study may be used for in field application for selenium removal from contaminated water this adsorbent can also be utilized for the groundwater and surface water selenium removal for drinking water treatment systems to reduce selenium concentration below 40 μg l 1 uncited references 8 40 60 61 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

12884,humic acids and macromolecular organics in pig farm wastewater can limit the efficacy of biochemical treatment and lead to high chroma in this work an ultrafiltration uf pretreatment method for building pig farm wastewater was developed key process parameters such as the membrane molecular weight cutoff mwco transmembrane pressure tmp and permeate reflux ratio were explored and optimized the membrane fouling was evaluated and the uf permeate underwent sequencing batch reactor sbr biochemical treatment the uf performance was appropriate at 100 kda and 0 1 mpa when the permeate reflux ratio was 200 the uf time was shortened by half after the uf permeate underwent sbr biochemical treatments the effluent met the current discharge standards gb18596 2001 the gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms results showed that uf pretreatment can reduce the concentration and types of organics in the sbr effluent a new wastewater treatment and resource recovery method for building pig farms is provided graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biogas slurry ultrafiltration sand filtration fractionation treatment biochemical treatment 1 introduction in recent years to save urban land resources 1 and improve pig farm biosecurity 2 many large scale pig breeding companies in the pearl river delta have begun to shift their breeding style from traditional single story to multistory buildings in the future building pig farms may become a mainstream pig raising model in city suburbs in building pig farm most manure is collected by a mechanical scraper and converted into organic fertilizer via aerobic fermentation swine wastewater including pig urine and cleaning wastewater is treated by upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb anaerobic digestion which can deodorize manure and produce biogas 3 5 however most solid manure is used for composting resulting in a low organic content in swine wastewater the biogas output of the anaerobic treatment system is low and it is not enough to generate electricity and produce ozone moreover anaerobic digestate biogas slurry is a high concentration organic wastewater that is difficult to biochemically treat 6 biogas slurry contains many macromolecular humic substances it is difficult to use anoxic oxic a o or sequencing batch reactor sbr technology for biochemical treatment and the problems of substandard biochemical effluent high chroma and high sludge yield often occur therefore it is necessary to explore a new biogas slurry pretreatment process to reduce macromolecular refractory substances and improve the stability of the biochemical treatment systems used for pig farm wastewater at present many methods such as fenton processes 7 8 flocculation and coagulation 9 and ozonation 10 are used to pretreat biogas slurry these chemical methods have some disadvantages such as high energy consumption the production of byproducts waste residue etc low ozone utilization efficiency and nutrient waste in contrast physical separation methods have the advantages of low energy consumption and no negative effects 11 biogas slurry is composed of large amounts of complex highly concentrated dissolved organic matter dom and insoluble suspended solids ss 12 the chemical composition of wastewater organic matter with different particle sizes is different 13 therefore the hydrolysis rates of wastewater organic matter with different particle sizes are also different small particles are easier to hydrolyze than large particles because they have a larger specific surface area 14 large particles of refractory organic matter in biogas slurry may be an important factor affecting the biochemical treatment of wastewater wang et al found that the high ss concentration in pig farm wastewater is the main reason for the substandard of the biochemical treatment effluent 15 most of the chemical oxygen demand cod and phosphorus in wastewater are large particles or inert particles while the content of soluble cod and phosphorus is relatively small so the biochemical treatment of wastewater is difficult another study also found that the presence of a large amount of macromolecular organic matter such as humic acid in biogas slurry is the main reason for its low biodegradability 16 therefore the use of physical methods to separate large molecule and small molecule organic matter in biogas slurry may reduce the pollution load of wastewater and improve its biochemical treatment efficiency membrane separation is a new wastewater treatment technology that is widely used in the removal of organics in wastewater and has great development prospects 17 18 it utilizes the pressure difference between the two sides of a membrane and this pressure difference is used as the driving force to separate the components in the wastewater among membrane separation technologies ultrafiltration uf can filter most organic matter with a molecular weight in the range of 10 100 nm uf can not only reduce the cost of wastewater treatment 19 but also effectively remove macromolecular organic matter and ss 20 21 at present uf membrane technology is mostly used in the fields of industrial wastewater 22 fermentation broth 23 and urban wastewater treatment 24 traditional uf is often used at the end of wastewater treatment systems in this way although membrane pollution is reduced the pollution load of the front end biochemical treatment system is very high increasing power consumption and the c n and p resources in the wastewater are converted into sludge and wasted pi et al found that uf pretreatment of landfill leachate can separate nonbiodegradable or macromolecular substances thereby improving the biodegradability of the leachate 25 collado et al found that the pretreatment of landfill leachate by uf helps to reduce the content of humic acid thereby improving the efficiency of biological treatment 20 pi et al used a combined aeration coagulation uf process to treat landfill leachate which improved the bod5 cod b c ratio 26 therefore uf pretreatment can not only reduce the pollution load of wastewater and improve biodegradability but also recover the organic concentrate to improve the resource utilization however uf pretreatment in pig farm biogas slurry has not been reported membrane fouling is a recognized challenge in the application of membrane technology studies have found that applying pretreatment methods such as biochar adsorption 21 coagulation 27 and ozonation 28 29 can effectively alleviate uf membrane fouling and prolong the membrane cleaning cycle however these pretreatment methods consume large amounts of energy and are complicated to operate in contrast sand filtration sf is a convenient and simple prefiltration method 30 in this work pig farm biogas slurry was used as the research object and an sf uf biogas slurry pretreatment unit was established the biogas slurry was treated by sf uf to obtain two liquid permeate and concentrate permeate was further treated by biochemical treatment and the concentrate was used as organic liquid fertilizer to return to the farmland 31 this work investigated the effect of different uf process parameters on organic pollutant removal from biogas slurry and analyzed the fouling mechanism and control method of uf membranes permeate after intercepting macromolecular organics enters the sbr biochemical treatment system to further explore the impact of uf pretreatment on the wastewater biochemical system this study will provide a new idea and scientific basis for the treatment of pig farm wastewater in urban buildings with scarce land resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials biogas slurry was taken from the cover lagoon digester effluent of the nansha pig farm in guangzhou after the large impurities were filtered they were stored in a refrigerator at 4 c a sand column was used for prefiltration to remove large particles of matter from the biogas slurry

results for the abovementioned membrane comparison experiment the 100 kda uf membrane showed better membrane flux and pollutant removal efficiency then the single factor variable method was used ① tmp

the permeate reflux ratio permeate volume biogas slurry was set to 100 200 300 and 400 and the influence of different reflux ratios on membrane flux was explored the changes in membrane flux and membrane fouling resistance under different tmp and reflux ratios were analyzed and suitable uf process parameters were determined 2 2 3 sbr biochemical treatment of the uf permeate sbr biochemical

treatment efficiency of biogas slurry sbr domestication was performed according to luo et al 32 seed sludge was taken from a sewage treatment plant in dongguan and the mixed liquid suspended solids mlss was 15 0 32 g l the operating volume of the sbr was 3 l the hydraulic retention time hrt was 6 d and sludge was discharged every 6 d at the beginning of each cycle a peristaltic pump was used to feed 500 ml of biogas slurry and the system was drained after the end of each cycle during sbr operation the codcr nh3 n and tp of the biochemical effluent were monitored every day to evaluate the impact of the uf pretreatment process on the operation of the sbr biochemical system the operation of the whole system was controlled by a programmable logic controller plc 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 membrane fouling resistance calculations total membrane resistance rt is composed of membrane resistance rm and membrane fouling resistance rf rf is composed of reversible membrane fouling resistance rr and irreversible membrane fouling resistance rir the normalized flux current permeate flux divided by the corresponding initial flux is used to provide dimensionless values of flux to enable a more reasonable comparison between different conditions rr and rir can be determined by the degree of recovery of the normalized flux after backwashing 30 33 each experiment was carried out with a new uf membrane the tmp was 0 10 mpa and the backwash tmp was 0 10 mpa first the rm of the uf membrane was calculated according to eq 3 a total of 200 ml of ultrapure water was filtered and the initial flux j0 of the membrane was tested then the uf system filtered 50 ml of biogas slurry each time and the membrane flux at the end of the filtration was recorded as j1 the uf membrane was installed in the uf cup with the reverse side up 50 ml ultrapure water was filtered and the membrane was backwashed finally the front side of the uf membrane was installed in the uf cup 200 ml of

japan the experimental data were analyzed by spss 22 0 and plotted with origin 9 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of sand filtration on the basic characteristics of biogas slurry table 1 shows the removal of organic and inorganic matter from the biogas slurry by sand filtration the removal rates of codcr tp chroma and turbidity of biogas slurry by sf were 22 43 14 and 28 respectively however the removal rates of soluble substances such as nh3 n uv254 and doc were poor less than 5 this result is similar to the results reported by guo et al 30 biogas slurry contains a large amount of ss which is mainly composed of complex organic and inorganic substances such as colloids and humic acid these substances are not easily degraded by anaerobic microorganisms and are discharged with the biogas slurry previous studies have shown that these organics are the main cause of membrane fouling 34 35 ni et al found that continuous sf can effectively remove wastewater turbidity and organic pollutant content to maintain stable operation of a uf system 36 racar et al used coagulation sf methods to alleviate membrane fouling 37 we will discuss the impact of sf on the removal of organic pollutants and membrane flux in the next section 3 2 removal of biogas slurry pollutants by different mwco membranes and changes in membrane flux 3 2 1 removal effect of organic pollutants in biogas slurry as shown in fig 2 the effects of uf membranes with different mwcos on the removal of organic and inorganic matter from biogas slurry were compared the removal rate of codcr by the four types of membranes was in the range of 24 15 39 70 with a decrease in the mwco the codcr removal rate increased slightly after sf uf the rate of codcr removal by the four membranes increased by 3 98 10 54 0 87 and 4 49 uv254 was used to characterize the aromatic substances in wastewater and the doc was used to characterize the content of soluble organic substances as shown in fig 2b the uv254 rate of removal of the four types of membranes was 12 25 and the 10 kda membrane had the highest rate of uv254 removal but sf uf has little effect on improvements in the uv254 removal rate this result shows that sf uf is not effective in removing aromatic compounds from biogas slurry fig 2c shows the rate of doc removal which was similar to that of the uv254 and the removal rate was in the range of 12 20 these results also show that sf uf is not effective in removing soluble organic carbon from biogas slurry wang et al also found that uf membranes have a low toc removal rate 38 previous studies have indicated that uf has a limited effect on the removal of soluble organic matter such as doc and uv254 39 40 therefore small molecule organic matter 10 kda dominated the biogas slurry in this study so membranes with large pores exhibited poor removal performance as shown in fig 2d the uf membrane had good chroma removal rates in the biogas slurry reaching 62 72 but as the mwco was decreased the removal rate did not increase significantly this result indicates that the molecular weight of most of the colored substances in the biogas slurry was greater than 100 kda and that sf uf had a good effect on the colored substances 3 2 2 membrane flux fig 3 presents the influence of sf on membrane flux at the beginning of the experiment the membrane flux of the four membranes showed a trend of rapid decline and then gradual stabilization at the end vfc 5 of the experiment the membrane end point fluxes of sf uf were 42 03 l m2 h 39 92 l m2 h 38 75 l m2 h and 14 80 l m2 h these values represent increases of 7 78 l m2 h 2 61 l m2 h 2 61 l m2 h and 3 92 l m2 h over those of the control group interestingly the initial decline rate of sf uf membrane flux was slower than uf and the filtration time was reduced by 18 42 5 71 5 56 and 26 67 respectively this finding is similar to the results of previous studies 41 and indicates that sf removes some of the ss from the biogas slurry which can alleviate membrane blockage to a certain extent and increase the membrane flux this result may also be related to the biological activities in the sand column 30 42 it has been reported that natural biological filtration by slow sf can remove particles colloids and biopolymers from the secondary effluent thereby improving the subsequent uf performance 43 guo et al reported that after two months of continuous operation of slow sf the biological activity of the sand column gradually increased which improved the rate of removal of inorganic pollutants such as ammonia nitrogen 30 however after sf many substances with molecular weights greater than 100 kda remained in the biogas slurry which continued to form a filter cake layer on the membrane surface during uf eventually leading to a decrease in membrane flux 44 45 this mechanism is consistent with the membrane flux in the later period of the uf experiments therefore from the perspective of engineering efficiency the 100 kda uf membrane was considered to be the most suitable 3 2 3 effect of tmp on biogas slurry uf pretreatment fig 4 shows the changes in membrane normalized flux and fouling resistance under different tmps the working pressure of uf affects the cost and energy consumption of engineering applications 46 a reduction in normalized membrane flux is highly correlated with resistance to membrane fouling 33 in fig 4 the membrane flux decreases rapidly in the initial stage of uf and then soon begins to stabilize the membrane normalized flux drops rapidly to approximately 0 3 in the range of vfc 2 but the degree of decline is different as shown in fig 4a the larger the tmp is the faster the normalized flux decreases this finding indicates that a large amount of organic matter in the biogas slurry forms a blocking layer on the surface of the membrane within a short period of time the work reported by mikulasek et al supports this view 47 they proved that the flux reached a stable or nearly stable value due to the shear on the surface of the cake an increase in tmp causes a decrease in membrane flux to further explore the reasons for the increase in fouling we studied the distribution of membrane fouling resistance as shown in fig 4b the results showed that as the tmp was increased rt decreased by 15 30 10 77 and 6 21 and rr decreased by 16 36 13 91 and 14 57 respectively rir trended upward after surpassing a pressure of 0 10 mpa rm remained essentially unchanged it is possible that the increase in tmp led to an increase in fouling layer compaction the increase in rir was the main reason for the decrease in the normalized flux of the membrane and bilad s group reached a similar conclusion 48 the results revealed that the larger the tmp was the larger the rir was and the more serious the membrane fouling an appropriate tmp is beneficial for reducing the tendency of membrane fouling therefore choosing the right working pressure is a reasonable strategy for controlling membrane fouling when the tmp was 0 10 mpa the membrane rt and rir were the smallest so we chose 0 10 mpa as the tmp for this experiment 3 3 effect of the uf permeate reflux ratio fig 5 shows the effects of different uf permeate reflux ratios on membrane flux reduction and membrane fouling resistance from the beginning of uf until the vfc reached 5 as shown in fig 5a an increase in the reflux ratio slowed the downward trend of the membrane normalized flux that is 400 300 200 100 0 the larger the reflux ratio was the slower the reduction in membrane normalized flux compared with that of the control group the uf time was shortened by 39 52 56 and 60 respectively permeate reflux can dilute the concentration of ss in biogas slurry to a certain extent reduce the blockage of membrane pores and improve uf efficiency when the permeate reflux ratio was 200 the uf time was shortened by half fig 5b shows that as the reflux ratio was increased rt decreased by 39 62 52 43 56 05 and 59 90 and rr decreased by 41 60 51 97 54 61 and 57 42 in general reflux of the uf permeate can effectively reduce the rr and rir of the membrane and reduce the formation of a membrane filter cake which is beneficial to saving membrane cleaning costs during engineering applications and improving the operating efficiency of the system in summary we chose a 100 kda membrane 0 10 mpa and a 200 permeate reflux ratio as the appropriate uf process parameters for this study 3 4 3d eem analysis of uf concentrate fig 6 shows the composition of raw biogas slurry and concentrated biogas slurry fluorescent organics including the position shift and intensity of the fluorescence peaks this result indicates that biogas slurry was composed of many kinds of complex soluble organic matter raw biogas slurry has two main peaks in the r3 and r5 regions which represent fulvic acid substances and humic acid substances respectively 29 49 after uf the macromolecular organic matter 100 kda in the biogas slurry was retained fig 6b only r5 exhibited strong peaks fig 6c shows that the fluorescence peak intensity of the raw biogas slurry was higher than that of the concentrate especially r5 a total of 65 87 of the small molecule soluble humic acid organics in the biogas slurry passed through the uf membrane alexandra sanchez et al found that uf membranes could effectively intercept fluorescent compounds such as proteins and humus in wastewater 50 their results were similar to the results of this study humic acids and other macromolecular organic matter 100 kda in biogas slurry cannot pass through uf membranes while small molecule organic matter 100 kda such as tyrosine and tryptophan can pass through uf membranes 51 uf pretreatment greatly reduces the volume and transportation cost of biogas slurry for land use 51 52 moreover the concentrate is rich in humic acid and has great resource reuse value it can be used as an organic liquid fertilizer for landscaping and can increase the content of soil organic matter 31 3 5 effects of uf permeate sbr wastewater biochemical treatment 3 5 1 removal of cod nh3 n and tp after the biogas slurry was pretreated by uf the permeate entered the sbr system for biochemical treatment from fig 7a during the 25 day period of sbr operation the change in ph of the two groups of sbr were basically the same the sbr uf biochemical effluent cod ranged from 160 200 mg l and that of sbr rw ranged from 190 256 mg l fig 7b the values of sbr rw were approximately 25 higher than those of sbr uf it has been reported that the higher the molecular weight and humification degree of organic matter are the more difficult it is to be degraded and utilized by microorganisms 53 after the macromolecular cod 100 kda in the biogas slurry is retained by the uf membrane the small cod 100 kda in the permeate is more easily degraded by microorganisms so the effect of sbr uf biochemical treatment is better than that of sbr rw small molecular substances are more easily used by microorganisms and can greatly improve the efficiency of nitrogen removal 54 55 moreover the effluent concentrations of nh3 n and tp in sbr uf were lower than those in sbr rw fig 7c and d sand filtration uf pretreatment can remove particulate n and p from biogas slurry thereby reducing their impact on the biochemical system which is conducive to the removal of n and p by microorganisms the sbr uf biochemical effluent concentrations almost met china s current discharge standard gb18596 2001 cod 400 mg l nh3 n 80 mg l tp 8 mg l tp slightly exceeded the standard possibly because the hrt of the biochemical system was too long and delayed the sludge discharge in the actual production process after biochemical treatment of pig farm wastewater the addition of chemicals is necessary to meet the p discharge standard 3 5 2 removal of biochemical effluent organic matter from the sbr we used gc ms technology to analyze the composition of organic matter in the sbr biochemical effluent to evaluate the effect of the uf pretreatment on the removal of organic pollutants from the biogas slurry fig 8 and table 2 show the total ion chromatograms of the biochemical effluent and the composition of organic matter of sbr rw and sbr uf the organic matter in the biochemical effluent was mainly composed of alkanes esters and amide compounds there were 12 kinds of organic compounds with similarity greater than 70 in the sbr rw biochemical effluent among them undecane 1 2 benzenedicarboxylic acid bis 2 methylpropyl ester and 13 docosenamide z account for 5 51 5 02 and 84 24 respectively and they were the main components of organic matter in the biochemical effluent the organic composition of the sbr uf biochemical effluent also includes alkanes esters and amide compounds compared with the composition of sbr rw the biochemical effluent contained fewer types of organic compounds the sbr uf biochemical effluent had only 9 organic substances with a similarity greater than 70 undecane 1 2 benzenedicarboxylic acid and bis 2 methylpropyl ester accounted for 4 79 and 4 32 respectively which were 0 73 and 0 70 less than the contents in the sbr rw in addition the sbr rw biochemical effluent contained three organic substances that sbr uf did not have 2 5 furandione 3 methyl phthalic anhydride and benzoic acid 3 5 bis 1 1 dimethylethyl 4 hydroxy the gc ms results showed that the uf pretreatment process can effectively reduce the type and concentration of organic matter in subsequent sbr biochemical effluents and improve the degradation efficiency of the microorganisms in the sbr biochemical system for the organic pollutants in biogas slurry 4 conclusion the sf uf pretreatment effectively solved the problem of standard discharge and resource utilization of biogas slurry from pig farms in urban buildings in this study a uf pretreatment process was used to fractionate biogas slurry and the uf process parameters were optimized the results showed that biogas slurry sf can remove some of the solid suspended matter and reduce membrane clogging the sand column prefiltration 100 kda membrane and 0 10 mpa transmembrane pressure had an appropriate uf performance in addition the reflux of permeate can reduce membrane fouling and improve uf efficiency after biochemical treatment of the permeate the kind and concentration of organic matter in the effluent were lower than those without uf in conclusion the uf pretreatment process has great potential in the treatment of wastewater from building pig farms declaration of competing

12884,humic acids and macromolecular organics in pig farm wastewater can limit the efficacy of biochemical treatment and lead to high chroma in this work an ultrafiltration uf pretreatment method for building pig farm wastewater was developed key process parameters such as the membrane molecular weight cutoff mwco transmembrane pressure tmp and permeate reflux ratio were explored and optimized the membrane fouling was evaluated and the uf permeate underwent sequencing batch reactor sbr biochemical treatment the uf performance was appropriate at 100 kda and 0 1 mpa when the permeate reflux ratio was 200 the uf time was shortened by half after the uf permeate underwent sbr biochemical treatments the effluent met the current discharge standards gb18596 2001 the gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms results showed that uf pretreatment can reduce the concentration and types of organics in the sbr effluent a new wastewater treatment and resource recovery method for building pig farms is provided graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords biogas slurry ultrafiltration sand filtration fractionation treatment biochemical treatment 1 introduction in recent years to save urban land resources 1 and improve pig farm biosecurity 2 many large scale pig breeding companies in the pearl river delta have begun to shift their breeding style from traditional single story to multistory buildings in the future building pig farms may become a mainstream pig raising model in city suburbs in building pig farm most manure is collected by a mechanical scraper and converted into organic fertilizer via aerobic fermentation swine wastewater including pig urine and cleaning wastewater is treated by upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb anaerobic digestion which can deodorize manure and produce biogas 3 5 however most solid manure is used for composting resulting in a low organic content in swine wastewater the biogas output of the anaerobic treatment system is low and it is not enough to generate electricity and produce ozone moreover anaerobic digestate biogas slurry is a high concentration organic wastewater that is difficult to biochemically treat 6 biogas slurry contains many macromolecular humic substances it is difficult to use anoxic oxic a o or sequencing batch reactor sbr technology for biochemical treatment and the problems of substandard biochemical effluent high chroma and high sludge yield often occur therefore it is necessary to explore a new biogas slurry pretreatment process to reduce macromolecular refractory substances and improve the stability of the biochemical treatment systems used for pig farm wastewater at present many methods such as fenton processes 7 8 flocculation and coagulation 9 and ozonation 10 are used to pretreat biogas slurry these chemical methods have some disadvantages such as high energy consumption the production of byproducts waste residue etc low ozone utilization efficiency and nutrient waste in contrast physical separation methods have the advantages of low energy consumption and no negative effects 11 biogas slurry is composed of large amounts of complex highly concentrated dissolved organic matter dom and insoluble suspended solids ss 12 the chemical composition of wastewater organic matter with different particle sizes is different 13 therefore the hydrolysis rates of wastewater organic matter with different particle sizes are also different small particles are easier to hydrolyze than large particles because they have a larger specific surface area 14 large particles of refractory organic matter in biogas slurry may be an important factor affecting the biochemical treatment of wastewater wang et al found that the high ss concentration in pig farm wastewater is the main reason for the substandard of the biochemical treatment effluent 15 most of the chemical oxygen demand cod and phosphorus in wastewater are large particles or inert particles while the content of soluble cod and phosphorus is relatively small so the biochemical treatment of wastewater is difficult another study also found that the presence of a large amount of macromolecular organic matter such as humic acid in biogas slurry is the main reason for its low biodegradability 16 therefore the use of physical methods to separate large molecule and small molecule organic matter in biogas slurry may reduce the pollution load of wastewater and improve its biochemical treatment efficiency membrane separation is a new wastewater treatment technology that is widely used in the removal of organics in wastewater and has great development prospects 17 18 it utilizes the pressure difference between the two sides of a membrane and this pressure difference is used as the driving force to separate the components in the wastewater among membrane separation technologies ultrafiltration uf can filter most organic matter with a molecular weight in the range of 10 100 nm uf can not only reduce the cost of wastewater treatment 19 but also effectively remove macromolecular organic matter and ss 20 21 at present uf membrane technology is mostly used in the fields of industrial wastewater 22 fermentation broth 23 and urban wastewater treatment 24 traditional uf is often used at the end of wastewater treatment systems in this way although membrane pollution is reduced the pollution load of the front end biochemical treatment system is very high increasing power consumption and the c n and p resources in the wastewater are converted into sludge and wasted pi et al found that uf pretreatment of landfill leachate can separate nonbiodegradable or macromolecular substances thereby improving the biodegradability of the leachate 25 collado et al found that the pretreatment of landfill leachate by uf helps to reduce the content of humic acid thereby improving the efficiency of biological treatment 20 pi et al used a combined aeration coagulation uf process to treat landfill leachate which improved the bod5 cod b c ratio 26 therefore uf pretreatment can not only reduce the pollution load of wastewater and improve biodegradability but also recover the organic concentrate to improve the resource utilization however uf pretreatment in pig farm biogas slurry has not been reported membrane fouling is a recognized challenge in the application of membrane technology studies have found that applying pretreatment methods such as biochar adsorption 21 coagulation 27 and ozonation 28 29 can effectively alleviate uf membrane fouling and prolong the membrane cleaning cycle however these pretreatment methods consume large amounts of energy and are complicated to operate in contrast sand filtration sf is a convenient and simple prefiltration method 30 in this work pig farm biogas slurry was used as the research object and an sf uf biogas slurry pretreatment unit was established the biogas slurry was treated by sf uf to obtain two liquid permeate and concentrate permeate was further treated by biochemical treatment and the concentrate was used as organic liquid fertilizer to return to the farmland 31 this work investigated the effect of different uf process parameters on organic pollutant removal from biogas slurry and analyzed the fouling mechanism and control method of uf membranes permeate after intercepting macromolecular organics enters the sbr biochemical treatment system to further explore the impact of uf pretreatment on the wastewater biochemical system this study will provide a new idea and scientific basis for the treatment of pig farm wastewater in urban buildings with scarce land resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials biogas slurry was taken from the cover lagoon digester effluent of the nansha pig farm in guangzhou after the large impurities were filtered they were stored in a refrigerator at 4 c a sand column was used for prefiltration to remove large particles of matter from the biogas slurry

slurry as shown in fig 2 the effects of uf membranes with different mwcos on the removal of organic and inorganic matter from biogas slurry were compared the removal rate of codcr by the four types of membranes was in the range of 24 15 39 70 with a decrease in the mwco the codcr removal rate increased slightly after sf uf the rate of codcr removal by the four membranes increased by 3 98 10 54 0 87 and 4 49 uv254 was used to characterize the aromatic substances in wastewater and the doc was used to characterize the content of soluble organic substances as shown in fig 2b the uv254 rate of removal of the four types of membranes was 12 25 and the 10 kda membrane had the highest rate of uv254 removal but sf uf has little effect on improvements in the uv254 removal rate this result shows that sf uf is not effective in removing aromatic compounds from biogas slurry fig 2c shows the rate of doc removal which was similar to that of the uv254 and the removal rate was in the range of 12 20 these results also show that sf uf is not effective in removing soluble organic carbon from biogas slurry wang et al also found that uf membranes have a low toc removal rate 38 previous studies have indicated that uf has a limited effect on the removal of soluble organic matter such as doc and uv254 39 40 therefore small molecule organic matter 10 kda dominated the biogas slurry in this study so membranes with large pores exhibited poor removal performance as shown in fig 2d the uf membrane had good chroma removal rates in the biogas slurry reaching 62 72 but as the mwco was decreased the removal rate did not increase significantly this result indicates that the molecular weight of most of the colored substances in the biogas slurry was greater than 100 kda and that sf uf had a good effect on the colored substances 3 2 2 membrane flux fig 3 presents the influence of sf on membrane flux at the beginning of the experiment the membrane flux of the four membranes showed a trend of rapid decline and then gradual stabilization at the end vfc 5 of the experiment the membrane end point fluxes of sf uf were 42 03 l m2 h 39 92 l m2 h 38 75 l m2 h and 14 80 l m2 h these values represent increases of 7 78 l m2 h 2 61 l m2 h 2 61 l m2 h and 3 92 l m2 h over those of the control group interestingly the initial decline rate of sf uf membrane flux was slower than uf and the filtration time was reduced by 18 42 5 71 5 56 and 26 67 respectively this finding is similar to the results of previous studies 41 and indicates that sf removes some of the ss from the biogas slurry which can alleviate membrane blockage to a certain extent and increase the membrane flux this result may also be related to the biological activities in the sand column 30 42 it has been reported that natural biological filtration by slow sf can remove particles colloids and biopolymers from the secondary effluent thereby improving the subsequent uf performance 43 guo et al reported that after two months of continuous operation of slow sf the biological activity of the sand column gradually increased which improved the rate of removal of inorganic pollutants such as ammonia nitrogen 30 however after sf many substances with molecular weights greater than 100 kda remained in the biogas slurry which continued to form a filter cake layer on the membrane surface during uf eventually leading to a decrease in membrane flux 44 45 this mechanism is consistent with the membrane flux in the later period of the uf experiments therefore from the perspective of engineering efficiency the 100 kda uf membrane was considered to be the most suitable 3 2 3 effect of tmp on biogas slurry uf pretreatment fig 4 shows the changes in membrane normalized flux and fouling resistance under different tmps the working pressure of uf affects the cost and energy consumption of engineering applications 46 a reduction in normalized membrane flux is highly correlated with resistance to membrane fouling 33 in fig 4 the membrane flux decreases rapidly in the initial stage of uf and then soon begins to stabilize the membrane normalized flux drops rapidly to approximately 0 3 in the range of vfc 2 but the degree of decline is different as shown in fig 4a the larger the tmp is the faster the normalized flux decreases this finding indicates that a large amount of organic matter in the biogas slurry forms a blocking layer on the surface of the membrane within a short period of time the work reported by mikulasek et al supports this view 47 they proved that the flux reached a stable or nearly stable value due to the shear on the surface of the cake an increase in tmp causes a decrease in membrane flux to further explore the reasons for the increase in fouling we studied the distribution of membrane fouling resistance as shown in fig 4b the results showed that as the tmp was increased rt decreased by 15 30 10 77 and 6 21 and rr decreased by 16 36 13 91 and 14 57 respectively rir trended upward after surpassing a pressure of 0 10 mpa rm remained essentially unchanged it is possible that the increase in tmp led to an increase in fouling layer compaction the increase in rir was the main reason for the decrease in the normalized flux of the membrane and bilad s group reached a similar conclusion 48 the results revealed that the larger the tmp was the larger the rir was and the more serious the membrane fouling an appropriate tmp is beneficial for reducing the tendency of membrane fouling therefore choosing the right working pressure is a reasonable strategy for controlling membrane fouling when the tmp was 0 10 mpa the membrane rt and rir were the smallest so we chose 0 10 mpa as the tmp for this experiment 3 3 effect of the uf permeate reflux ratio fig 5 shows the effects of different uf permeate reflux ratios on membrane flux reduction and membrane fouling resistance from the beginning of uf until the vfc reached 5 as shown in fig 5a an increase in the reflux ratio slowed the downward trend of the membrane normalized flux that is 400 300 200 100 0 the larger the reflux ratio was the slower the reduction in membrane normalized flux compared with that of the control group the uf time was shortened by 39 52 56 and 60 respectively permeate reflux can dilute the concentration of ss in biogas slurry to a certain extent reduce the blockage of membrane pores and improve uf efficiency when the permeate reflux ratio was 200 the uf time was shortened by half fig 5b shows that as the reflux ratio was increased rt decreased by 39 62 52 43 56 05 and 59 90 and rr decreased by 41 60 51 97 54 61 and 57 42 in general reflux of the uf permeate can effectively reduce the rr and rir of the membrane and reduce the formation of a membrane filter cake which is beneficial to saving membrane cleaning costs during engineering applications and improving the operating efficiency of the system in summary we chose a 100 kda membrane 0 10 mpa and a 200 permeate reflux ratio as the appropriate uf process parameters for this study 3 4 3d eem analysis of uf concentrate fig 6 shows the composition of raw biogas slurry and concentrated biogas slurry fluorescent organics including the position shift and intensity of the fluorescence peaks this result indicates that biogas slurry was composed of many kinds of complex soluble organic matter raw biogas slurry has two main peaks in the r3 and r5 regions which represent fulvic acid substances and humic acid substances respectively 29 49 after uf the macromolecular organic matter 100 kda in the biogas slurry was retained fig 6b only r5 exhibited strong peaks fig 6c shows that the fluorescence peak intensity of the raw biogas slurry was higher than that of the concentrate especially r5 a total of 65 87 of the small molecule soluble humic acid organics in the biogas slurry passed through the uf membrane alexandra sanchez et al found that uf membranes could effectively intercept fluorescent compounds such as proteins and humus in wastewater 50 their results were similar to the results of this study humic acids and other macromolecular organic matter 100 kda in biogas slurry cannot pass through uf membranes while small molecule organic matter 100 kda such as tyrosine and tryptophan can pass through uf membranes 51 uf pretreatment greatly reduces the volume and transportation cost of biogas slurry for land use 51 52 moreover the concentrate is rich in humic acid and has great resource reuse value it can be used as an organic liquid fertilizer for landscaping and can increase the content of soil organic matter 31 3 5 effects of uf permeate sbr wastewater biochemical treatment 3 5 1 removal of cod nh3 n and tp after the biogas slurry was pretreated by uf the permeate entered the sbr system for biochemical treatment from fig 7a during the 25 day period of sbr operation the change in ph of the two groups of sbr were basically the same the sbr uf biochemical effluent cod ranged from 160 200 mg l and that of sbr rw ranged from 190 256 mg l fig 7b the values of sbr rw were approximately 25 higher than those of sbr uf it has been reported that the higher the molecular weight and humification degree of organic matter are the more difficult it is to be degraded and utilized by microorganisms 53 after the macromolecular cod 100 kda in the biogas slurry is retained by the uf membrane the small cod 100 kda in the permeate is more easily degraded by microorganisms so the effect of sbr uf biochemical treatment is better than that of sbr rw small molecular substances are more easily used by microorganisms and can greatly improve the efficiency of nitrogen removal 54 55 moreover the effluent concentrations of nh3 n and tp in sbr uf were lower than those in sbr rw fig 7c and d sand filtration uf pretreatment can remove particulate n and p from biogas slurry thereby reducing their impact on the biochemical system which is conducive to the removal of n and p by microorganisms the sbr uf biochemical effluent concentrations almost met china s current discharge standard gb18596 2001 cod 400 mg l nh3 n 80 mg l tp 8 mg l tp slightly exceeded the standard possibly because the hrt of the biochemical system was too long and delayed the sludge discharge in the actual production process after biochemical treatment of pig farm wastewater the addition of chemicals is necessary to meet the p discharge standard 3 5 2 removal of biochemical effluent organic matter from the sbr we used gc ms technology to analyze the composition of organic matter in the sbr biochemical effluent to evaluate the effect of the uf pretreatment on the removal of organic pollutants from the biogas slurry fig 8 and table 2 show the total ion chromatograms of the biochemical effluent and the composition of organic matter of sbr rw and sbr uf the organic matter in the biochemical effluent was mainly composed of alkanes esters and amide compounds there were 12 kinds of organic compounds with similarity greater than 70 in the sbr rw biochemical effluent among them undecane 1 2 benzenedicarboxylic acid bis 2 methylpropyl ester and 13 docosenamide z account for 5 51 5 02 and 84 24 respectively and they were the main components of organic matter in the biochemical effluent the organic composition of the sbr uf biochemical effluent also includes alkanes esters and amide compounds compared with the composition of sbr rw the biochemical effluent contained fewer types of organic compounds the sbr uf biochemical effluent had only 9 organic substances with a similarity greater than 70 undecane 1 2 benzenedicarboxylic acid and bis 2 methylpropyl ester accounted for 4 79 and 4 32 respectively which were 0 73 and 0 70 less than the contents in the sbr rw in addition the sbr rw biochemical effluent contained three organic substances that sbr uf did not have 2 5 furandione 3 methyl phthalic anhydride and benzoic acid 3 5 bis 1 1 dimethylethyl 4 hydroxy the gc ms results showed that the uf pretreatment process can effectively reduce the type and concentration of organic matter in subsequent sbr biochemical effluents and improve the degradation efficiency of the microorganisms in the sbr biochemical system for the organic pollutants in biogas slurry 4 conclusion the sf uf pretreatment effectively solved the problem of standard discharge and resource utilization of biogas slurry from pig farms in urban buildings in this study a uf pretreatment process was used to fractionate biogas slurry and the uf process parameters were optimized the results showed that biogas slurry sf can remove some of the solid suspended matter and reduce membrane clogging the sand column prefiltration 100 kda membrane and 0 10 mpa transmembrane pressure had an appropriate uf performance in addition the reflux of permeate can reduce membrane fouling and improve uf efficiency after biochemical treatment of the permeate the kind and concentration of organic matter in the effluent were lower than those without uf in conclusion the uf pretreatment process has great potential in the treatment of wastewater from building pig farms declaration of competing
