24305,monitoring fires using satellite images is a fundamental tool for managers of protected areas pas however false alerts hinder their ability and make their application unfeasible since there are few fire brigades available for field checks thus this research proposes the validation identification and prediction of active fires for the years 2001 to 2018 for a protected area of the brazilian savanna the validation was performed by counting the active fires that were effectively contained in a burning area by cross referencing modis sensor images identification was performed by analyzing the spectral behavior of burning and non burning in the active fire area the maximum entropy was calculated from the spectral values and compared between an active focus with and without burning in the prediction the climatic conditions of the month before burning were analyzed and the maximum entropy value was evaluated for model viability the results indicated that only 30 of the active fires were actually in a burned area the use of maximum entropy favors the improvement of the modis active fire product the confirmed fires were in regions where the probability was above 75 whereas the non burning fires were approximately 60 the variables evapotranspiration wind speed water deficit and road proximity were the most relevant for the active fire prediction model for the validation years 2019 and 2020 this method predicted the location of fires in 75 of the cases this methodology once employed by pa managers can ensure accurate efficient and cost effective monitoring of forest fire prevention and combat keywords cerrado climate spectral behavior forest fires modis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction considered a biodiversity hotspot the brazilian savannah known as the cerrado occupies approximately 24 of the national territory and represents the savannah with the greatest diversity of flora and fauna on the planet however this area also has the highest rates of deforestation and forest fires strassburg et al 2017 according to the mapbiomas 2021 survey between the years 2000 to 2019 the savanna was the biome most affected by fires and it is estimated that 41 of its area has been affected according to schmidt and eloy 2020 this increase in burning is associated with a change in management and political rhetoric in the country that weakened environmental law enforcement and decreased investment in the protection of natural ecosystems which encouraged deforestation forest fires violence against local communities and environmentalists the majority of fires in the savanna are initiated by anthropogenic action particularly agricultural practices that are widely used for the management of small to large agricultural crops piromal et al 2008 the consequences of forest fires include loss of biodiversity disruption of microbial processes and alteration of biogeochemical cycles vadrevu et al 2019 technologies for field monitoring of burned areas and burn severity while being essential are expensive in terms of time and resources fernandez manso et al 2019 and alternative remote sensing technologies can enable monitoring for reduced cost and accuracy and can assist in identifying the location of origin and direction of fire travel therefore the use of remote sensing in recent decades has allowed technological advances in mapping fire dynamics location of fire occurrences and quantification of burned areas pereira et al 2017 the identification of areas at risk of forest fires is fundamental for the management and planning of protected areas and the behavior patterns of active fires in relation to climatic conditions can be used as tools to predict the possible locations of the foci data on climatic variations contribute to the understanding of forest fires because they are directly related to the number of fires and burned areas jolly et al 2015 fernandez manso et al 2019 emphasized that factors related to climate forest structure and topography are used to model the fire distribution and burn severity active fires treated in a pointwise manner can be incorporated into the maximum entropy maxent method the method determines the probability of occurrence according to the behavior of the independent variables in order to identify the respective influence on the reduction of prediction error according to moreno et al 2011 maximum entropy assumes that the best explanation of unknown phenomena will maximize the entropy of the probability distribution this model was introduced in ecological studies based on point data such as plant or animal species occurrence and provides the probability of target presence for given local conditions phillips et al 2006 phillips and dudík 2008 the model allows for an integration of climatic conditions and anthropogenic factors as input variables for estimating burned areas fonseca et al 2016 the maxent method has been used to model fire occurrence using different approaches such as the global analysis of future active fires moritz et al 2012 burned areas arnold et al 2014 paritsis et al 2013 peters et al 2013 and quantifying the spatial distribution of burning hotspots renard et al 2012 hamadeh et al 2017 reported that forest fires are on an increasing trend especially in relation to local and global climate change which makes fires challenging to fight prevention and combat actions are fundamental to the conservation of the biome in the cerrado these techniques are mainly employed in the protected areas pas which are strategic areas delimited by the government with the general objectives of the preservation maintenance sustainable use restoration and recovery of the natural environment sustainable production and guaranteed survival of living beings brasil 2000 the monitoring of the areas in the uruçuí una ecological station esecuuna includes a brigade team and members of the brazilian institute of environment and renewable natural resources ibama however these groups are not sufficient for monitoring the vast territorial extension of the area another method of monitoring the esecuuna is by means of heat sources obtained from the national institute for space research inpe since there is no monitoring technology to detect and validate the sources for better orientation of firefighting teams medeiros and cunha 2006 the esecuuna monitors forest fires using fire brigade patrols according to a survey conducted by medeiros and cunha 2006 pivello 2011 stated that the most common strategies applied by managers of pas are firebreaks around or inside the pas fire use prohibition periodic patrols and awareness campaigns to improve these techniques spectral information from active fires is proposed which tend to show divergent spectral behavior from areas that have not yet been affected by fire according to emmy prema et al 2018 by surveying the literature separation of the active focus from other targets can be achieved by analyzing the color texture shape and area from digital images with regard to satellite imagery for forest fire detection and monitoring specific image processing techniques have been employed to identify active fires and burned areas active fire detection is based on surface temperature wan et al 2014 and the related algorithm uses a contextual approach by comparing the apparent temperature of a fire pixel with that of neighboring non fire pixels giglio et al 2009 parto and saradjian 2011 however this process is flawed in terms of indicating effectively burning locations at the time of active fire detection because it does not identify neighboring areas that may contain ignition source materials fonseca et al 2017 this research aimed to evaluate an active fire in terms of the validation identification and predictability of emergence using maximum entropy the validation attempts to analyze the active fires that are effectively burned while identification maintains that the maximum entropy can select the active fire and evaluate the probability of emergence of the foci this information is relevant for the improvement of the monitoring of burning foci which can allow for the integration of the actions and strategies for the control and combat of forest fires 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the esecuuna is located in the ne 44 57ʹ49ʺ w and 8 53ʹ02ʺ s se 45 11ʹ37ʺ w and 9 06ʹ34ʺ s nw 45 23ʹ02ʺ w and 8 39ʹ26ʺ s and sw 45 26ʹ19ʺ w and 8 54ʹ24ʺ s quadrants corresponding to an area of 135 000 ha it is located in the cerrado of southwestern piauiense more specifically in the sub region of the high plateaus of piauiense whose vegetation cover is composed predominantly of cerrado sensu stricto and campo cerrado fig 1 fires in the surrounding areas can reach the interior of the esecuuna therefore a 50 km buffer was delimited around the unit constituting a total area of 17 233 84 km² 2 2 data description earth surface climate data for the years 2001 to 2018 were used and satellites were chosen that provided images with the best available spatial and temporal resolutions as shown in table 1 2 2 1 climate variable descriptions mod11a1 surface temperature and emissivity derived from surface reflectance the images were corrected for water vapor effects and thus it was possible to estimate the surface temperature under different atmospheric conditions wan et al 2015 mod16a2 uses logic from the penman monteith equation on modis sensor images such as vegetation dynamics albedo and land cover to estimate evapotranspiration running et al 2021 chirps incorporates weather station data with satellite imagery from the microwave spectral range and thus defines precipitation on a daily time scale funk et al 2015 terraclimate provides a set of images with climate and climate water balance information for the earth s surface the data refer to an interpolation of information from meteorological stations combined with climatological normals from worldclim regarding water balance the modified thornthwaite mather model was used and extractable soil water storage capacity data were used on a 0 5 grid abatzoglou et al 2018 2 2 2 surface variable descriptions srtm the shuttle radar topography mission srtm was a mission in 2000 to obtain information regarding the altitude variation of the earth s surface using the interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar technique farr et al 2007 mod09ga provides an estimate of the spectral reflectance of the surface divided into seven bands in the spectral range between 620 and 2155 nm the images provide an estimate of reflectance at ground level corrected for scattering and absorption effects from the atmosphere vermote e wolfe 2015 mapbiomas this project performs annual mapping of land use and land cover for the entire brazilian territory through the classification of landsat images in programming routines from the google earth engine and collects data related to the national road network souza junior and azevedo 2017 sigef refers to certified public and private properties and this data is available for download by address in shapefile format https certificacao incra gov br csv shp export shp py 2 2 3 burn variable descriptions mod14a1 refers to the radiance in the spectral range of 4 and 11 nm which detects active fires with emitted energy that is strong enough to verify that it is a fire taking into account the variability of temperature and the reflection of sunlight giglio et al 2016 mcd64a1 is a combination of data from the terra and aqua satellites which uses the micrometer spectral range to compose the burn sensitive vegetation index the processing is done by observing the changes on the surface where the active fires are located the burned and unburned areas are classified by the bayes rule method rodrigues et al 2019 the pixel record is given by the approximate julian date of the fire occurrence giglio et al 2018 the use of mcd64a1 was preferred for the validation of the active fires because both are modis sensor products thus there is a standardization of the images from the geographic projection and data processing the method can also be implemented more easily if the detection of active fires is improved by the land processes distributed active archive center lp daac 2 3 state 1 diagnostics of the active fire the diagnostics of the active fire was performed by crossing the information from the modis sensor mod14a1 product active fire and mcd64a1 product burn area images analyzed monthly for the period from 2001 to 2018 the validation process was conducted using the routine in google earth engine with eqs 1 2 and 3 1 f ts i day n x where x 1 if f i 6 x 0 if f i 6 where fts time series of the active fire fi mod14a1 image of the day the value greater than 6 corresponds to the pixels with reliable information of the existence of the active fire according to the information in the image metadata according to giglio et al 2018 x raster value of the image and n number of days in the month being processed 2 a t s x 1 if a i 6 and q a i 1 x 0 if a i 1 where ats

where x 1 if f ts 1 x 2 if f ts 1 and a ts 1 x 0 if f ts 0 where vts time series of the confirmed active fire x raster value of the image and n number of days in the month being processed therefore after the applied operations the confirmed active fires were those with a value of the resulting image vts of 2 and 1 for the unconfirmed active fires with monthly images from 2001 to 2018 of validated active fires pixel value 2 unconfirmed active fires pixel value 1 and no fire areas pixel value 0 we performed the accounting of areas of each class through the analysis of raster statistics using the image histogram the procedure was to extract the frequency of occurrence of the pixel value in each class to quantify the confirmed active fire in relation to the affected locations the land use class images from mapbiomas and the delimitation of the properties registered in the land management system sigef were cross referenced which was performed annually from 2001 to 2018 the process to account for the active fire in terms of affected locations was as follows rasterize the vectors to contain the image referring to certified public and private properties whose pixel value was 1 for the area within the property and 0 for the rest of the scene therefore it was possible to obtain two images corresponding to the mentioned products reclassify the land use classes to anthropic use class 1 and natural use class 2 as shown in table 2 multiply the image of the confirmed active fire for each image reported above therefore all values contained outside the target of interest were annulled the quantification of the areas was performed by means of raster statistics the raster histogram was determined in which the frequency of pixels in the class of interest was counted 2 4 stage 2 identification of active fires the identification of the active fires aimed at distinguishing the foci from the false alerts in this sense unlike the stage 1 in which the active fires were evaluated and quantified through the crossing of images of the burning scar the aim was to classify the active fires from the others in an instantaneous mode this information becomes relevant to guide the firefighting team to avoid going to places of false alert the analysis initiated from the pre supposition that the active fire has a divergent spectral behavior between a focus with and without the presence of fire thus the probability value of the active fires was verified using the maximum entropy from the images of surface reflectance of the modis sensor product mod09ga and the active fire with burning was compared to that without fire the input data for the maximum entropy model were the surface reflectance normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and normalized burn ratio nbr table 3 at the instant that the active fire was recorded the constitution of the reflectance images was obtained by the routine in the google earth engine that executed eqs 4 and 5 4 ρ f ts i day n f ts ρ r

reflectance at the active fire and x raster value of the image the maximum entropy was calculated using the surface reflectance and spectral indices as independent variables and the active fire as the dependent variable this method estimates the distribution that is closest in a geographically uniform space using poisson probability analysis the method aims to define the locations where the dependent variable is present furthermore the generalized bernoulli linear model was used with the log log link function according to fithian et al 2015 as it is the most appropriate for estimating the probability of presence the sample set was divided into 30 for validation about 52 thousand samples and 70 for training about 122 thousand samples and the process was repeated until the entire sample set was used in the training thus the data set was submitted to 10 model repetitions and for each one a cross validation was performed it considered a convergence threshold of 1 0e 5 with 5000 interactions and 10 000 background points as well as the auto features options in the program maxent phillips et al 2006 the evaluation metric used was the area under the curve auc which allowed the sensitivity and specificity of the model to be analyzed represented by the x and y axes respectively of the graph in which the area is calculated auc reveals the predictive ability of the model with values from 0 to 1 where 1 perfect performance 0 5 approximately random prediction 0 5 0 7 poor performance 0 7 0 9 acceptable performance and 0 9 high performance fithian et al 2015 the importance of the variables was defined by resampling using the jackknife method in which a variable was excluded each time the model was run to assess its influence on the auc pearson et al 2007 this method allowed us to evaluate the most important variable by means of the prediction gain whereby values closer to zero represent a random model and those closer to 1 indicate a high correlation with the analyzed occurrences phillips and dudík 2008 2 5 stage 3 probability of active fires as a function of climate in this stage we tried to estimate possible locations for the appearance of fires based on weather information from the month before the occurrences based on the assumption that the weather conditions preceding a forest fire can be used as an input in the prediction model average weather data from the month prior to the fire occurrence was used as an independent variable in the maxent model for the period from 2001 to 2018 in addition to the meteorological information land surface data such as land use radiation moisture index and road proximity were incorporated into the independent variables table 4 the annual base land use was provided by mapbiomas solar radiation was calculated according to mccune and keon 2002 and the humidity index was proposed by beven and kirkby 1979 both derived from the terrain altitude the main and side roads that make up the esecuuna were mapped and the matrix image of road proximity was obtained using the euclidean distance algorithm according to romero calcerrada et al 2010 as a function of the road network of esecuuna and its surroundings data processing was performed monthly in order to observe the behavior of the variables by their importance in decreasing the prediction error the results of the significance were compared to determine the pattern that prevailed over the years 2001 to 2018 the validation of the model was performed using the same parameters as in stage 2 however the sample set was reduced because in this case only the confirmed active fires were considered in this sense the sample set was composed of about 45 thousand samples for training and about 19 thousand samples for testing the auc and the importance of the variables were defined for each processed year by means of jackknife resampling friedman friedman 1937 and nemenyi nemenyi 1963 tests were used to identify the variables of greatest importance in predicting fires the friedman test performs a nonparametric analysis of variance for a single factor of variation and compares independent samples by ordering the data by increasing value whereby the original values are replaced by the number of the order in a set of ordered series miranda et al 2020 having defined the main variables for the prediction the criterion for estimating the fire outbreaks for the year 2019 and 2020 was established by the value of the peak of the response curve for each variable in each month of the 18 years this value represents the highest probability of fire occurrence in the maxent model therefore the values of the peaks of the response curve were extracted considering a confidence interval of 95 which defined the condition of the fire risk level in the area in practice for each pixel of the variable contained in the given interval a condition for the occurrence of fire was considered thus the maximum level of fire risk in the area was limited to the number of variables in the prediction model in summary a survey of active fires was conducted to confirm the presence of burning the use of maximum entropy was then proposed for greater accuracy of the modis active fire product and its estimation for the following month based on the climatic variables fig 2 3 results 3 1 state 1 diagnostics of the active fire the confirmed active fires represented approximately 31 of the total detected by the mod14a1 image therefore technologies capable of improving the accuracy of fire detection are required for this sensor the lowest percentages of confirmed active fires were in the months from january to april and the highest percentages were in the months from august to october fig 3 an average of 3000 confirmed fires were recorded per year with peaks in the years 2010 and 2012 september prevailed as the month with the highest occurrence of fires with average approximately 6800 active fires throughout the years from 2001 to 2018 in the survey from 2001 to 2018 71 of the fires originated in private areas of which 94 were found in natural vegetation fig 4 this combination of areas affected by fire indicates anthropic action fires in natural areas which may be a result of the opening of new areas for agricultural purposes 3 2 stage 2 identification of active fires the confirmed active fires express actual fires and this technique can be used for effective monitoring once the assertive location of the burning is defined thereby optimizing the actions of the fire brigade the surface reflectance was satisfactory for the design of the maximum entropy probability because for most of the years analyzed the auc was greater than 0 7 with the exception of 2007 and 2012 which had lower values although they were higher than 0 6 fig 5 the infrared band contributed the most to the estimation of the probability of active fires throughout the years from 2001 to 2017 for the year 2018 the ndvi had the greatest contribution to the model and this variable change may be associated with the profiles of the affected areas that were smaller in private areas and larger in public areas compared to the year 2017 the difference between confirmed and unconfirmed active fires was notable based on the probability of the presence of active fires through maximum entropy from the behavior from 2001 to 2018 the probability averaged 0 75 and 0 62 for confirmed and unconfirmed fires respectively fig 6 the average value above 0 6 for the unconfirmed active fires may be related to the effect of spectral mixing in the neighboring region between pixels in which in places where there is actual burning the increase in temperature may indicate that the surrounding regions are the focus of burning the behavior standard for unconfirmed active fires was more stable in the range of 0 63 but for confirmed active fires in the years 2007 2009 and 2018 the values were higher than 0 8 which reinforced the discrepancy in value between active and non burning fires and the importance of maximum entropy in their differentiation after applying this methodology for the years 2019 and 2020 the difference in probability between confirmed mean 0 81 and unconfirmed mean 0 62 active fires prevailed fig 7 the spatialization of the probability indicated areas with a high probability of burning but no recorded fires however the locations of the active fires are known therefore these regions should be the focus for the value of the probability acquired by the maximum entropy thus the results demonstrate the possibility of filtering active fires in order to remove false alerts which can optimize the effective combat against forest fires 3 3 stage 3 probability of active fires as a function of climate the survey of monthly averages of climate variables allowed a pattern of behavior over time to be obtained for comparison with the weather conditions recorded at the time of the active fire fig 8 the rainy period corresponds to the months from october to march with the highest rainfall volume in january 190 mm the dry period of the region corresponds to the months from april to september with june to august enduring lengthy periods without rain the lowest rates of evapotranspiration were from august to october although april may and june which generally have little rainfall have an evapotranspiration rate of 10 mm per day on average over the other months this difference may be related to the influence of agricultural activities and irrigated crops the highest temperature occurred in september with an average of 40 c and the mildest temperature period was between january and may the wind speed varied from 0 5 to 2 5 m s 1 with the months from june to october with the highest wind speed above 1 m s 1 as for the water deficit the largest record and greatest variation occurred in october with approximately 60 to 120 mm the october period also coincides with the main agricultural management practices that precede rainfall which may have contributed to the increase in the water deficit because of the higher incidence of exposed soil in this period for each year analyzed there was a different behavior regarding the contribution of the independent variables in august the influence of water deficit prevailed followed by wind speed especially in 2003 2005 and 2013 fig 9 in september evapotranspiration and wind speed were the variables of greatest importance with emphasis on the years 2005 2012 and 2013 for the month of october evapotranspiration and proximity to roads were most prominent in 2003 and 2015 the area under the curve values were greater than 0 60 for the analyses in the period from 2001 to 2018 fig 10 with the months of august and october indicating the highest auc values the month of september is characterized by a higher incidence of fires and several factors are involved in their emergence including anthropic action the friedmann and nemenyi tests indicated that the variables that prevailed statistically from 2001 to 2018 were of greatest importance for the probability of active fires fig 11 the months of august september and october were determined to have seven five and six statistically superior variables respectively in general the variables wind speed water deficit road proximity and evapotranspiration were common in all months thus the joint evaluation of all months indicated only these variables thus restricting the other variables in later evaluations the response curve established the ranges in which the independent variables performed best in estimating the probability of fires fig 12 wind speed ranged from 1 2 to 1 7 with little variation over the months the water deficit range increased over the months starting from 75 mm in august to 115 mm in october evapotranspiration exhibited the opposite behavior to water deficit from the highest value in august averaging 1 1 mm to 0 6 mm in october as for the proximity of roads the range that contemplated the occurrences of maximum limit was 18 km in august to 15 km in october therefore the profile of areas prone to burning characterized that over the months that the burning occurs with increasing water deficit there is decreasing evapotranspiration and closer proximity to roads given that four variables of greater importance were obtained in the probability of estimation of fires it was considered that each interval of the response curve corresponds to a degree of burning condition when applying the interval established in the response curves for 2019 and 2020 september 2019 and october 2020 showed almost the entire area with some degree of condition for the emergence of fires fig 13 considering the boundary of the esecuuna the region located to the northwest presented some level of condition to present active fires in all months and years analyzed and because it is a recurrent area it can be considered for prevention planning areas in level zero do not present of condition for burning there were no places with a degree of burning level 4 or a condition for the four variables to be feasible for the emergence of active fires in the quantification of the areas in each level of burning condition and model verification 70 of the existing active fires were in some degree of burning condition the months of september 2019 and october 2020 obtained the higher values with 91 71 and 94 89 respectively table 5 4 discussion 4 1 state 1 diagnostics of the active fire mod14a1 is a 1 km resolution image that presents a spectral mixture of the targets which may affect the accuracy of the active fires this product considers only the surface temperature and does not analyze the spectral behavior of the adjacent targets according to giglio et al 2009 mod14a1 images are characterized by providing information on the burning location at the time of satellite passage and do not allow for the estimation of burned areas thus active fire detection errors can occur pereira et al 2012 validated the active fires using landsat images in a cerrado area and found that only 26 were detected in mod14a1 images schroeder et al 2008 observed that 75 of the sampled active fires were omitted from the mod14a1 product the omitted cases may be caused by the characteristics of the brazilian cerrado which has low vegetation and low tree cover and the fires in this region are relatively low in temperature slow burning and can vary in duration from minutes to a few hours which makes them difficult to detect by satellites since at the time of passage the surface may not be sufficiently hot to be detected as an active fire focus schroeder et al 2008 however with the validation of active fires after burning it can be used as a tool for investigating the cause of the fire for inspection purposes because this method ensures the point of origin of the burning by the elimination of inactive fires most of the registered and confirmed active fires were on private property whereby natural vegetation was the most affected this behavior is typical when new agricultural areas are opened according to medeiros and cunha 2006 there are 101 families registered in the esecuuna most of which are family farmers the agricultural practices developed by these producers use fire as a tool to prepare the soil for planting and pasture renewal and often it is used indiscriminately which is the reason it is the main cause of forest fires inside the esecuuna 4 2 stage 2 identification of active fires with the spectral information obtained from the mod09ga product in conjunction with the active fires of mod14a1 it was possible to differentiate and detect only the effective active fires which are those that have the presence of burning the spectral behavior of the fire is divergent from that of the other targets and they are generally identifiable in the image according to emmy prema et al 2018 flame detection in an image can be affected by the characteristics of color texture shape and area that constitute a pattern of fire behavior thus there are a number of factors that can differentiate between areas with and without fire the analysis of the importance of the variables with an emphasis on the near infrared wavelength nir is relevant for the formulation of a methodology for active fire detection with the specific use of nir the location of an active fire can provide insights into localization owing to the incorporation of satellites that make this band available with greater spatial resolution such as the mod09ga product that includes this band at 250 m according to schroeder et al 2008 the incorporation of the infrared band in the validation of active fires reduces omission errors in the mod14a1 image thus the gain from burning observations is significant for monitoring fires as it is accurate and cost effective anerao et al 2018 the registration of mod14a1 images occurs at the same time as mod09ga images and these can be used together to better define active fires with and without burning the maximum entropy technique provided a distinction of active fires which demonstrates the potential use of this tool for the improvement of the mod14a1 product the maximum entropy criterion for identifying an active fire in the presence of burning can be useful for fire brigades that often have a reduced team for monitoring and fighting forest fires if adopted by fire monitoring units this maximum entropy approach can improve the quality of fire detection as it can be applied to mod14a1 images and be made available on virtual fire alert platforms due to the high assertiveness of the model according to the simplified selection process notices 2019 2020 and 2021 the esecuuna hires 14 firefighters on a temporary basis for six months to assist in areas such as firebreak maintenance road improvement and maintenance fire control and monitoring and station surveillance if the surrounding area is considered this number of firefighters may not be sufficient to respond to a fire alert thus by applying the maximum entropy method to mod09ga images the firefighting team can be directed to fight confirmed fires and thus avoid false alerts 4 3 stage 3 probability of active fires as a function of climate the climate survey of monthly averages from 2001 to 2018 can be utilized to understand any relationship with forest fires it was observed that at the end of the dry season the climatic conditions favor a higher concentration of burning factors such as low precipitation high temperature high water deficit and wind speed in addition to low evapotranspiration which indicates dry vegetation on the surface all these factors were found between august and october which coincided with the highest incidence of burning outbreaks severe forest fires are more likely at the end of the dry season when there is an accumulation of dry fuel load alves and pérez cabello 2017 andersen et al 2005 williams et al 1998 the maximum entropy for this purpose proved efficient because the majority of aucs were greater than 0 7 the advantage of this method is that it is possible to obtain data one month in advance thus allowing the protected area managers to monitor take fire control actions construct firebreaks and alert the population of the risks of a fire starting and spreading fonseca et al 2016 applied maxent in the detection of areas prone to burning as a decision making tool in prevention and firefighting management actions due to the efficiency of the model and these measures are able to minimize forest degradation and carbon loss by forest fires the estimation of active fires by maximum entropy from meteorological data was satisfactory considering the auc value chen et al 2015 using meteorological data to detect burning foci in daxinganling china chen et al 2015 obtained an average auc value of 0 866 those authors indicated that precipitation had the greatest impact on the observations due to natural burning cases caused by lightning fonseca et al 2016 applied maxent to climate and land use variables in the amazon and found the efficiency of the model with 0 91 for auc and highlighted that deforestation was the most effective variable for estimating the occurrence of active burning fires in the annual burn probability evaluations highlighting the importance of each variable it was not possible to obtain a pattern to determine which variables would be most effective in estimating fires thus the use of statistical techniques such as nemenyi is fundamental for this type of approach the results of this statistical test indicated that the variables road proximity evapotranspiration water deficit and wind speed were the main contributors to modeling the probability of fires thus response curve evaluations were performed only for these variables the intervals of the values of the variables stipulated by the response curve demonstrate the range of climate values that should be considered as favorable for a burn outbreak the values determined indicated a dry condition of the vegetation and this condition was accentuated from august to october this behavior was expected because august still has the influence of the rainy season while the soil and vegetation have water reserves that are lost over the months of september and october until the emergence of rain which tends to reduce the number of active fires schmidt and eloy 2020 reported that during the last 50 60 years fires in the brazilian savanna were concentrated between the months of august and october and climatic conditions of high temperatures commonly above 30 c heavy winds and low air humidity 30 caused forest fires of great proportion and severity to the biome as reported by durigan and ratter 2016 and macedo et al 2018 the validation of the model for the years 2019 and 2020 demonstrated the potential use of this tool for estimating active fires which for the months of september 2019 and october 2020 showed that approximately 90 were contained within the areas with a high probability of occurrence these results can guide managers in planning areas that require greater control and monitoring with respect to burning according to schmidt and eloy 2020 the brazilian savanna region is composed mainly of private lands and requires programs to be developed that include private landowners for the confrontation and mitigation of forest fires 5 conclusion the study of active fires in savanna demonstrated that the mod14a1 data need improvement when it comes to detecting burning however the application of the maxent algorithm to reflectance images from mod09a1 was able to satisfactorily detect these active fires considering the auc values this gain in accuracy in the detection of active fires by maximum entropy could assist in the construction or improvement of fire monitoring platforms for active fire prediction the variables evapotranspiration water deficit wind speed and road proximity were most effective for estimating fires one month in advance the results can provide further information for

24305,monitoring fires using satellite images is a fundamental tool for managers of protected areas pas however false alerts hinder their ability and make their application unfeasible since there are few fire brigades available for field checks thus this research proposes the validation identification and prediction of active fires for the years 2001 to 2018 for a protected area of the brazilian savanna the validation was performed by counting the active fires that were effectively contained in a burning area by cross referencing modis sensor images identification was performed by analyzing the spectral behavior of burning and non burning in the active fire area the maximum entropy was calculated from the spectral values and compared between an active focus with and without burning in the prediction the climatic conditions of the month before burning were analyzed and the maximum entropy value was evaluated for model viability the results indicated that only 30 of the active fires were actually in a burned area the use of maximum entropy favors the improvement of the modis active fire product the confirmed fires were in regions where the probability was above 75 whereas the non burning fires were approximately 60 the variables evapotranspiration wind speed water deficit and road proximity were the most relevant for the active fire prediction model for the validation years 2019 and 2020 this method predicted the location of fires in 75 of the cases this methodology once employed by pa managers can ensure accurate efficient and cost effective monitoring of forest fire prevention and combat keywords cerrado climate spectral behavior forest fires modis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction considered a biodiversity hotspot the brazilian savannah known as the cerrado occupies approximately 24 of the national territory and represents the savannah with the greatest diversity of flora and fauna on the planet however this area also has the highest rates of deforestation and forest fires strassburg et al 2017 according to the mapbiomas 2021 survey between the years 2000 to 2019 the savanna was the biome most affected by fires and it is estimated that 41 of its area has been affected according to schmidt and eloy 2020 this increase in burning is associated with a change in management and political rhetoric in the country that weakened environmental law enforcement and decreased investment in the protection of natural ecosystems which encouraged deforestation forest fires violence against local communities and environmentalists the majority of fires in the savanna are initiated by anthropogenic action particularly agricultural practices that are widely used for the management of small to large agricultural crops piromal et al 2008 the consequences of forest fires include loss of biodiversity disruption of microbial processes and alteration of biogeochemical cycles vadrevu et al 2019 technologies for field monitoring of burned areas and burn severity while being essential are expensive in terms of time and resources fernandez manso et al 2019 and alternative remote sensing technologies can enable monitoring for reduced cost and accuracy and can assist in identifying the location of origin and direction of fire travel therefore the use of remote sensing in recent decades has allowed technological advances in mapping fire dynamics location of fire occurrences and quantification of burned areas pereira et al 2017 the identification of areas at risk of forest fires is fundamental for the management and planning of protected areas and the behavior patterns of active fires in relation to climatic conditions can be used as tools to predict the possible locations of the foci data on climatic variations contribute to the understanding of forest fires because they are directly related to the number of fires and burned areas jolly et al 2015 fernandez manso et al 2019 emphasized that factors related to climate forest structure and topography are used to model the fire distribution and burn severity active fires treated in a pointwise manner can be incorporated into the maximum entropy maxent method the method determines the probability of occurrence according to the behavior of the independent variables in order to identify the respective influence on the reduction of prediction error according to moreno et al 2011 maximum entropy assumes that the best explanation of unknown phenomena will maximize the entropy of the probability distribution this model was introduced in ecological studies based on point data such as plant or animal species occurrence and provides the probability of target presence for given local conditions phillips et al 2006 phillips and dudík 2008 the model allows for an integration of climatic conditions and anthropogenic factors as input variables for estimating burned areas fonseca et al 2016 the maxent method has been used to model fire occurrence using different approaches such as the global analysis of future active fires moritz et al 2012 burned areas arnold et al 2014 paritsis et al 2013 peters et al 2013 and quantifying the spatial distribution of burning hotspots renard et al 2012 hamadeh et al 2017 reported that forest fires are on an increasing trend especially in relation to local and global climate change which makes fires challenging to fight prevention and combat actions are fundamental to the conservation of the biome in the cerrado these techniques are mainly employed in the protected areas pas which are strategic areas delimited by the government with the general objectives of the preservation maintenance sustainable use restoration and recovery of the natural environment sustainable production and guaranteed survival of living beings brasil 2000 the monitoring of the areas in the uruçuí una ecological station esecuuna includes a brigade team and members of the brazilian institute of environment and renewable natural resources ibama however these groups are not sufficient for monitoring the vast territorial extension of the area another method of monitoring the esecuuna is by means of heat sources obtained from the national institute for space research inpe since there is no monitoring technology to detect and validate the sources for better orientation of firefighting teams medeiros and cunha 2006 the esecuuna monitors forest fires using fire brigade patrols according to a survey conducted by medeiros and cunha 2006 pivello 2011 stated that the most common strategies applied by managers of pas are firebreaks around or inside the pas fire use prohibition periodic patrols and awareness campaigns to improve these techniques spectral information from active fires is proposed which tend to show divergent spectral behavior from areas that have not yet been affected by fire according to emmy prema et al 2018 by surveying the literature separation of the active focus from other targets can be achieved by analyzing the color texture shape and area from digital images with regard to satellite imagery for forest fire detection and monitoring specific image processing techniques have been employed to identify active fires and burned areas active fire detection is based on surface temperature wan et al 2014 and the related algorithm uses a contextual approach by comparing the apparent temperature of a fire pixel with that of neighboring non fire pixels giglio et al 2009 parto and saradjian 2011 however this process is flawed in terms of indicating effectively burning locations at the time of active fire detection because it does not identify neighboring areas that may contain ignition source materials fonseca et al 2017 this research aimed to evaluate an active fire in terms of the validation identification and predictability of emergence using maximum entropy the validation attempts to analyze the active fires that are effectively burned while identification maintains that the maximum entropy can select the active fire and evaluate the probability of emergence of the foci this information is relevant for the improvement of the monitoring of burning foci which can allow for the integration of the actions and strategies for the control and combat of forest fires 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the esecuuna is located in the ne 44 57ʹ49ʺ w and 8 53ʹ02ʺ s se 45 11ʹ37ʺ w and 9 06ʹ34ʺ s nw 45 23ʹ02ʺ w and 8 39ʹ26ʺ s and sw 45 26ʹ19ʺ w and 8 54ʹ24ʺ s quadrants corresponding to an area of 135 000 ha it is located in the cerrado of southwestern piauiense more specifically in the sub region of the high plateaus of piauiense whose vegetation cover is composed predominantly of cerrado sensu stricto and campo cerrado fig 1 fires in the surrounding areas can reach the interior of the esecuuna therefore a 50 km buffer was delimited around the unit constituting a total area of 17 233 84 km² 2 2 data description earth surface climate data for the years 2001 to 2018 were used and satellites were chosen that provided images with the best available spatial and temporal resolutions as shown in table 1 2 2 1 climate variable descriptions mod11a1 surface temperature and emissivity derived from surface reflectance the images were corrected for water vapor effects and thus it was possible to estimate the surface temperature under different atmospheric conditions wan et al 2015 mod16a2 uses logic from the penman monteith equation on modis sensor images such as vegetation dynamics albedo and land cover to estimate evapotranspiration running et al 2021 chirps incorporates weather station data with satellite imagery from the microwave spectral range and thus defines precipitation on a daily time scale funk et al 2015 terraclimate provides a set of images with climate and climate water balance information for the earth s surface the data refer to an interpolation of information from meteorological stations combined with climatological normals from worldclim regarding water balance the modified thornthwaite mather model was used and extractable soil water storage capacity data were used on a 0 5 grid abatzoglou et al 2018 2 2 2 surface variable descriptions srtm the shuttle radar topography mission srtm was a mission in 2000 to obtain information regarding the altitude variation of the earth s surface using the interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar technique farr et al 2007 mod09ga provides an estimate of the spectral reflectance of the surface divided into seven bands in the spectral range between 620 and 2155 nm the images provide an estimate of reflectance at ground level corrected for scattering and absorption effects from the atmosphere vermote e wolfe 2015 mapbiomas this project performs annual mapping of land use and land cover for the entire brazilian territory through the classification of landsat images in programming routines from the google earth engine and collects data related to the national road network souza junior and azevedo 2017 sigef refers to certified public and private properties and this data is available for download by address in shapefile format https certificacao incra gov br csv shp export shp py 2 2 3 burn variable descriptions mod14a1 refers to the radiance in the spectral range of 4 and 11 nm which detects active fires with emitted energy that is strong enough to verify that it is a fire taking into account the variability of temperature and the reflection of sunlight giglio et al 2016 mcd64a1 is a combination of data from the terra and aqua satellites which uses the micrometer spectral range to compose the burn sensitive vegetation index the processing is done by observing the changes on the surface where the active fires are located the burned and unburned areas are classified by the bayes rule method rodrigues et al 2019 the pixel record is given by the approximate julian date of the fire occurrence giglio et al 2018 the use of mcd64a1 was preferred for the validation of the active fires because both are modis sensor products thus there is a standardization of the images from the geographic projection and data processing the method can also be implemented more easily if the detection of active fires is improved by the land processes distributed active archive center lp daac 2 3 state 1 diagnostics of the active fire the diagnostics of the active fire was performed by crossing the information from the modis sensor mod14a1 product active fire and mcd64a1 product burn area images analyzed monthly for the period from 2001 to 2018 the validation process was conducted using the routine in google earth engine with eqs 1 2 and 3 1 f ts i day n x where x 1 if f i 6 x 0 if f i 6 where fts time series of the active fire fi mod14a1 image of the day the value greater than 6 corresponds to the pixels with reliable information of the existence of the active fire according to the

after the applied operations the confirmed active fires were those with a value of the resulting image vts of 2 and 1 for the unconfirmed active fires with monthly images from 2001 to 2018 of validated active fires pixel value 2 unconfirmed active fires pixel value 1 and no fire areas pixel value 0 we performed the accounting of areas of each class through the analysis of raster statistics using the image histogram the procedure was to extract the frequency of occurrence of the pixel value in each class to quantify the confirmed active fire in relation to the affected locations the land use class images from mapbiomas and the delimitation of the properties registered in the land management system sigef were cross referenced which was performed annually from 2001 to 2018 the process to account for the active fire in terms of affected locations was as follows rasterize the vectors to contain the image referring to certified public and private properties whose pixel value was 1 for the area within the property and 0 for the rest of the scene therefore it was possible to obtain two images corresponding to the mentioned products reclassify the land use classes to anthropic use class 1 and natural use class 2 as shown in table 2 multiply the image of the confirmed active fire for each image reported above therefore all values contained outside the target of interest were annulled the quantification of the areas was performed by means of raster statistics the raster histogram was determined in which the frequency of pixels in the class of interest was counted 2 4 stage 2 identification of active fires the identification of the active fires aimed at distinguishing the foci from the false alerts in this sense unlike the stage 1 in which the active fires were evaluated and quantified through the crossing of images of the burning scar the aim was to classify the active fires from the others in an instantaneous mode this information becomes relevant to guide the firefighting team to avoid going to places of false alert the analysis initiated from the pre supposition that the active fire has a divergent spectral behavior between a focus with and without the presence of fire thus the probability value of the active fires was verified using the maximum entropy from the images of surface reflectance of the modis sensor product mod09ga and the active fire with burning was compared to that without fire the input data for the maximum entropy model were the surface reflectance normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and normalized burn ratio nbr table

reflectance at the active fire and x raster value of the image the maximum entropy was calculated using the surface reflectance and spectral indices as independent variables and the active fire as the dependent variable this method estimates the distribution that is closest in a geographically uniform space using poisson probability analysis the method aims to define the locations where the dependent variable is present furthermore the generalized bernoulli linear model was used with the log log link function according to fithian et al 2015 as it is the most appropriate for estimating the probability of presence the sample set was divided into 30 for validation about 52 thousand samples and 70 for training about 122 thousand samples and the process was repeated until the entire sample set was used in the training thus the data set was submitted to 10 model repetitions and for each one a cross validation was performed it considered a convergence threshold of 1 0e 5 with 5000 interactions and 10 000 background points as well as the auto features options in the program maxent phillips et al 2006 the evaluation metric used was the area under the curve auc which allowed the sensitivity and specificity of the model to be analyzed represented by the x and y axes respectively of the graph in which the area is calculated auc reveals the predictive ability of the model with values from 0 to 1 where 1 perfect performance 0 5 approximately random prediction 0 5 0 7 poor performance 0 7 0 9 acceptable performance and 0 9 high performance fithian et al 2015 the importance of the variables was defined by resampling using the jackknife method in which a variable was excluded each time the model was run to assess its influence on the auc pearson et al 2007 this method allowed us to evaluate the most important variable by means of the prediction gain whereby values closer to zero represent a random model and those closer to 1 indicate a high correlation with the analyzed occurrences phillips and dudík 2008 2 5 stage 3 probability of active fires as a function of climate in this stage we tried to estimate possible locations for the appearance of fires based on weather information from the month before the occurrences based on the assumption that the weather conditions preceding a forest fire can be used as an input in the prediction model average weather data from the month prior to the fire occurrence was used as an independent variable in the maxent model for the period from 2001 to 2018 in addition to the meteorological information land surface data such as land use radiation moisture index and road proximity were incorporated into the independent variables table 4 the annual base land use was provided by mapbiomas solar radiation was calculated according to mccune and keon 2002 and the humidity index was proposed by beven and kirkby 1979 both derived from the terrain altitude the main and side roads that make up the esecuuna were mapped and the matrix image of road proximity was obtained using the euclidean distance algorithm according to romero calcerrada et al 2010 as a function of the road network of esecuuna and its surroundings data processing was performed monthly in order to observe the behavior of the variables by their importance in decreasing the prediction error the results of the significance were compared to determine the pattern that prevailed over the years 2001 to 2018 the validation of the model was performed using the same parameters as in stage 2 however the sample set was reduced because in this case only the confirmed active fires were considered in this sense the sample set was composed of about 45 thousand samples for training and about 19 thousand samples for testing the auc and the importance of the variables were defined for each processed year by means of jackknife resampling friedman friedman 1937 and nemenyi nemenyi 1963 tests were used to identify the variables of greatest importance in predicting fires the friedman test performs a nonparametric analysis of variance for a single factor of variation and compares independent samples by ordering the data by increasing value whereby the original values are replaced by the number of the order in a set of ordered series miranda et al 2020 having defined the main variables for the prediction the criterion for estimating the fire outbreaks for the year 2019 and 2020 was established by the value of the peak of the response curve for each variable in each month of the 18 years this value represents the highest probability of fire occurrence in the maxent model therefore the values of the peaks of the response curve were extracted considering a confidence interval of 95 which defined the condition of the fire risk level in the area in practice for each pixel of the variable contained in the given interval a condition for the occurrence of fire was considered thus the maximum level of fire risk in the area was limited to the number of variables in the prediction model in summary a survey of active fires was conducted to confirm the presence of burning the use of maximum entropy was then proposed for greater accuracy of the modis active fire product and its estimation for the following month based on the climatic variables fig 2 3 results 3 1 state 1 diagnostics of the active fire the confirmed active fires represented approximately 31 of the total detected by the mod14a1 image therefore technologies capable of improving the accuracy of fire detection are required for this sensor the lowest percentages of confirmed active fires were in the months from january to april and the highest percentages were in the months from august to october fig 3 an average of 3000 confirmed fires were recorded per year with peaks in the years 2010 and 2012 september prevailed as the month with the highest occurrence of fires with average approximately 6800 active fires throughout the years from 2001 to 2018 in the survey from 2001 to 2018 71 of the fires originated in private areas of which 94 were found in natural vegetation fig 4 this combination of areas affected by fire indicates anthropic action fires in natural areas which may be a result of the opening of new areas for agricultural purposes 3 2 stage 2 identification of active fires the confirmed active fires express actual fires and this technique can be used for effective monitoring once the assertive location of the burning is defined thereby optimizing the actions of the fire brigade the surface reflectance was satisfactory for the design of the maximum entropy probability because for most of the years analyzed the auc was greater than 0 7 with the exception of 2007 and 2012 which had lower values although they were higher than 0 6 fig 5 the infrared band contributed the most to the estimation of the probability of active fires throughout the years from 2001 to 2017 for the year 2018 the ndvi had the greatest contribution to the model and this variable change may be associated with the profiles of the affected areas that were smaller in private areas and larger in public areas compared to the year 2017 the difference between confirmed and unconfirmed active fires was notable based on the probability of the presence of active fires through maximum entropy from the behavior from 2001 to 2018 the probability averaged 0 75 and 0 62 for confirmed and unconfirmed fires respectively fig 6 the average value above 0 6 for the unconfirmed active fires may be related to the effect of spectral mixing in the neighboring region between pixels in which in places where there is actual burning the increase in temperature may indicate that the surrounding regions are the focus of burning the behavior standard for unconfirmed active fires was more stable in the range of 0 63 but for confirmed active fires in the years 2007 2009 and 2018 the values were higher than 0 8 which reinforced the discrepancy in value between active and non burning fires and the importance of maximum entropy in their differentiation after applying this methodology for the years 2019 and 2020 the difference in probability between confirmed mean 0 81 and unconfirmed mean 0 62 active fires prevailed fig 7 the spatialization of the probability indicated areas with a high probability of burning but no recorded fires however the locations of the active fires are known therefore these regions should be the focus for the value of the probability acquired by the maximum entropy thus the results demonstrate the possibility of filtering active fires in order to remove false alerts which can optimize the effective combat against forest fires 3 3 stage 3 probability of active fires as a function of climate the survey of monthly averages of climate variables allowed a pattern of behavior over time to be obtained for comparison with the weather conditions recorded at the time of the active fire fig 8 the rainy period corresponds to the months from october to march with the highest rainfall volume in january 190 mm the dry period of the region corresponds to the months from april to september with june to august enduring lengthy periods without rain the lowest rates of evapotranspiration were from august to october although april may and june which generally have little rainfall have an evapotranspiration rate of 10 mm per day on average over the other months this difference may be related to the influence of agricultural activities and irrigated crops the highest temperature occurred in september with an average of 40 c and the mildest temperature period was between january and may the wind speed varied from 0 5 to 2 5 m s 1 with the months from june to october with the highest wind speed above 1 m s 1 as for the water deficit the largest record and greatest variation occurred in october with approximately 60 to 120 mm the october period also coincides with the main agricultural management practices that precede rainfall which may have contributed to the increase in the water deficit because of the higher incidence of exposed soil in this period for each year analyzed there was a different behavior regarding the contribution of the independent variables in august the influence of water deficit prevailed followed by wind speed especially in 2003 2005 and 2013 fig 9 in september evapotranspiration and wind speed were the variables of greatest importance with emphasis on the years 2005 2012 and 2013 for the month of october evapotranspiration and proximity to roads were most prominent in 2003 and 2015 the area under the curve values were greater than 0 60 for the analyses in the period from 2001 to 2018 fig 10 with the months of august and october indicating the highest auc values the month of september is characterized by a higher incidence of fires and several factors are involved in their emergence including anthropic action the friedmann and nemenyi tests indicated that the variables that prevailed statistically from 2001 to 2018 were of greatest importance for the probability of active fires fig 11 the months of august september and october were determined to have seven five and six statistically superior variables respectively in general the variables wind speed water deficit road proximity and evapotranspiration were common in all months thus the joint evaluation of all months indicated only these variables thus restricting the other variables in later evaluations the response curve established the ranges in which the independent variables performed best in estimating the probability of fires fig 12 wind speed ranged from 1 2 to 1 7 with little variation over the months the water deficit range increased over the months starting from 75 mm in august to 115 mm in october evapotranspiration exhibited the opposite behavior to water deficit from the highest value in august averaging 1 1 mm to 0 6 mm in october as for the proximity of roads the range that contemplated the occurrences of maximum limit was 18 km in august to 15 km in october therefore the profile of areas prone to burning characterized that over the months that the burning occurs with increasing water deficit there is decreasing evapotranspiration and closer proximity to roads given that four variables of greater importance were obtained in the probability of estimation of fires it was considered that each interval of the response curve corresponds to a degree of burning condition when applying the interval established in the response curves for 2019 and 2020 september 2019 and october 2020 showed almost the entire area with some degree of condition for the emergence of fires fig 13 considering the boundary of the esecuuna the region located to the northwest presented some level of condition to present active fires in all months and years analyzed and because it is a recurrent area it can be considered for prevention planning areas in level zero do not present of condition for burning there were no places with a degree of burning level 4 or a condition for the four variables to be feasible for the emergence of active fires in the quantification of the areas in each level of burning condition and model verification 70 of the existing active fires were in some degree of burning condition the months of september 2019 and october 2020 obtained the higher values with 91 71 and 94 89 respectively table 5 4 discussion 4 1 state 1 diagnostics of the active fire mod14a1 is a 1 km resolution image that presents a spectral mixture of the targets which may affect the accuracy of the active fires this product considers only the surface temperature and does not analyze the spectral behavior of the adjacent targets according to giglio et al 2009 mod14a1 images are characterized by providing information on the burning location at the time of satellite passage and do not allow for the estimation of burned areas thus active fire detection errors can occur pereira et al 2012 validated the active fires using landsat images in a cerrado area and found that only 26 were detected in mod14a1 images schroeder et al 2008 observed that 75 of the sampled active fires were omitted from the mod14a1 product the omitted cases may be caused by the characteristics of the brazilian cerrado which has low vegetation and low tree cover and the fires in this region are relatively low in temperature slow burning and can vary in duration from minutes to a few hours which makes them difficult to detect by satellites since at the time of passage the surface may not be sufficiently hot to be detected as an active fire focus schroeder et al 2008 however with the validation of active fires after burning it can be used as a tool for investigating the cause of the fire for inspection purposes because this method ensures the point of origin of the burning by the elimination of inactive fires most of the registered and confirmed active fires were on private property whereby natural vegetation was the most affected this behavior is typical when new agricultural areas are opened according to medeiros and cunha 2006 there are 101 families registered in the esecuuna most of which are family farmers the agricultural practices developed by these producers use fire as a tool to prepare the soil for planting and pasture renewal and often it is used indiscriminately which is the reason it is the main cause of forest fires inside the esecuuna 4 2 stage 2 identification of active fires with the spectral information obtained from the mod09ga product in conjunction with the active fires of mod14a1 it was possible to differentiate and detect only the effective active fires which are those that have the presence of burning the spectral behavior of the fire is divergent from that of the other targets and they are generally identifiable in the image according to emmy prema et al 2018 flame detection in an image can be affected by the characteristics of color texture shape and area that constitute a pattern of fire behavior thus there are a number of factors that can differentiate between areas with and without fire the analysis of the importance of the variables with an emphasis on the near infrared wavelength nir is relevant for the formulation of a methodology for active fire detection with the specific use of nir the location of an active fire can provide insights into localization owing to the incorporation of satellites that make this band available with greater spatial resolution such as the mod09ga product that includes this band at 250 m according to schroeder et al 2008 the incorporation of the infrared band in the validation of active fires reduces omission errors in the mod14a1 image thus the gain from burning observations is significant for monitoring fires as it is accurate and cost effective anerao et al 2018 the registration of mod14a1 images occurs at the same time as mod09ga images and these can be used together to better define active fires with and without burning the maximum entropy technique provided a distinction of active fires which demonstrates the potential use of this tool for the improvement of the mod14a1 product the maximum entropy criterion for identifying an active fire in the presence of burning can be useful for fire brigades that often have a reduced team for monitoring and fighting forest fires if adopted by fire monitoring units this maximum entropy approach can improve the quality of fire detection as it can be applied to mod14a1 images and be made available on virtual fire alert platforms due to the high assertiveness of the model according to the simplified selection process notices 2019 2020 and 2021 the esecuuna hires 14 firefighters on a temporary basis for six months to assist in areas such as firebreak maintenance road improvement and maintenance fire control and monitoring and station surveillance if the surrounding area is considered this number of firefighters may not be sufficient to respond to a fire alert thus by applying the maximum entropy method to mod09ga images the firefighting team can be directed to fight confirmed fires and thus avoid false alerts 4 3 stage 3 probability of active fires as a function of climate the climate survey of monthly averages from 2001 to 2018 can be utilized to understand any relationship with forest fires it was observed that at the end of the dry season the climatic conditions favor a higher concentration of burning factors such as low precipitation high temperature high water deficit and wind speed in addition to low evapotranspiration which indicates dry vegetation on the surface all these factors were found between august and october which coincided with the highest incidence of burning outbreaks severe forest fires are more likely at the end of the dry season when there is an accumulation of dry fuel load alves and pérez cabello 2017 andersen et al 2005 williams et al 1998 the maximum entropy for this purpose proved efficient because the majority of aucs were greater than 0 7 the advantage of this method is that it is possible to obtain data one month in advance thus allowing the protected area managers to monitor take fire control actions construct firebreaks and alert the population of the risks of a fire starting and spreading fonseca et al 2016 applied maxent in the detection of areas prone to burning as a decision making tool in prevention and firefighting management actions due to the efficiency of the model and these measures are able to minimize forest degradation and carbon loss by forest fires the estimation of active fires by maximum entropy from meteorological data was satisfactory considering the auc value chen et al 2015 using meteorological data to detect burning foci in daxinganling china chen et al 2015 obtained an average auc value of 0 866 those authors indicated that precipitation had the greatest impact on the observations due to natural burning cases caused by lightning fonseca et al 2016 applied maxent to climate and land use variables in the amazon and found the efficiency of the model with 0 91 for auc and highlighted that deforestation was the most effective variable for estimating the occurrence of active burning fires in the annual burn probability evaluations highlighting the importance of each variable it was not possible to obtain a pattern to determine which variables would be most effective in estimating fires thus the use of statistical techniques such as nemenyi is fundamental for this type of approach the results of this statistical test indicated that the variables road proximity evapotranspiration water deficit and wind speed were the main contributors to modeling the probability of fires thus response curve evaluations were performed only for these variables the intervals of the values of the variables stipulated by the response curve demonstrate the range of climate values that should be considered as favorable for a burn outbreak the values determined indicated a dry condition of the vegetation and this condition was accentuated from august to october this behavior was expected because august still has the influence of the rainy season while the soil and vegetation have water reserves that are lost over the months of september and october until the emergence of rain which tends to reduce the number of active fires schmidt and eloy 2020 reported that during the last 50 60 years fires in the brazilian savanna were concentrated between the months of august and october and climatic conditions of high temperatures commonly above 30 c heavy winds and low air humidity 30 caused forest fires of great proportion and severity to the biome as reported by durigan and ratter 2016 and macedo et al 2018 the validation of the model for the years 2019 and 2020 demonstrated the potential use of this tool for estimating active fires which for the months of september 2019 and october 2020 showed that approximately 90 were contained within the areas with a high probability of occurrence these results can guide managers in planning areas that require greater control and monitoring with respect to burning according to schmidt and eloy 2020 the brazilian savanna region is composed mainly of private lands and requires programs to be developed that include private landowners for the confrontation and mitigation of forest fires 5 conclusion the study of active fires in savanna demonstrated that the mod14a1 data need improvement when it comes to detecting burning however the application of the maxent algorithm to reflectance images from mod09a1 was able to satisfactorily detect these active fires considering the auc values this gain in accuracy in the detection of active fires by maximum entropy could assist in the construction or improvement of fire monitoring platforms for active fire prediction the variables evapotranspiration water deficit wind speed and road proximity were most effective for estimating fires one month in advance the results can provide further information for management units for using these tools in fire prevention and control planning in the protected areas of the brazilian savanna credit authorship contribution statement jonathan da rocha miranda person

24306,the uptake of carbonyl sulfide cos by plant canopy closely correlated with photosynthetic co2 uptake as they share the same diffusion pathway process based ecosystem models have been used to simulate the co2 h2o and cos fluxes between terrestrial ecosystems and atmosphere some model parameters often vary seasonally and interannually in this study the hourly boreal ecosystem productivity simulator beps was first improved to simulate the canopy cos uptake rate then an ensemble kalman filter was designed to optimize the key parameters of the hourly beps model considering the errors in the input parameters and measurements the optimized parameters include leaf maximum carboxylation rate at 25 c at top of canopy v c m a x 25 0 and a calibration term α used to scale the apparent conductance for cos uptake from the intercellular airspace g c o s to v c m a x the fluxes of gross primary productivity gpp latent heat le and cos uptake by canopy fcos veg measured using eddy covariance method at a temperate deciduous forest during 2012 2013 and a boreal conifer forest during 2013 2017 were used for data assimilation parameters were optimized daily and presented as 10 day averages it was found that the parameters showed considerable seasonally and interannually variations with parameter optimization using enkf the improved hourly beps model could explain 86 68 and 55 of variations in measured daily gpp le and fcos veg at us ha1 site during 2012 and 2013 and captured 90 74 and 69 of variations in the measured gpp le and fcos veg at fi hyy site during 2013 2017 respectively the simulated daily fcos veg with the parameters optimized using enkf could capture the day to day variations of fcos veg at the two studied sites and performed better than the simulations with calibrated parameter values further efforts were required to investigate the impacts of model structure and different parameter optimization methods on the optimized parameter values keywords carbonyl sulfide ensemble kalman filter parameter optimization data assimilation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction carbonyl sulfide ocs or cos hereafter cos is an atmospheric trace gasses 500 ppt that is promising for studies of carbon and water cycles montzka et al 2007 wohlfahrt et al 2012 cos uptake by the terrestrial ecosystems is the main sink of atmospheric cos whelan et al 2018 cos shares the same diffusion pathway into the leaf chloroplasts as co2 and is hydrolyzed completely by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase ca and is not emitted protoschill krebs et al 1996 this one way irreversible flux can be used to estimate photosynthetic uptake of co2 stomatal conductance and other leaf physiological parameters at spatiotemporal scales that are difficult to measure whelan et al 2018 using cos as a constraint on the carbon and water fluxes in terrestrial ecosystem models tems needs an accurate representation of ecosystem cos fluxes in models ecosystem cos fluxes have been implemented in tems such as the simple biosphere model version 3 sib3 berry et al 2013 organising carbon and hydrology in dynamic ecosystems orchidee maignan 2021 and the simple biosphere model version 4 sib4 kooijmans et al 2021 which are useful tools to estimate the cos fluxes between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere at site regional and global scales however estimates of global terrestrial ecosystem cos fluxes from the models were quite different ranging from 753 to 1845 gg s yr 1 kooijmans et al 2021 a source of uncertainty for simulating cos fluxes by ecosystem models is the model parameterization due to the complexity and spatiotemporal variations of ecosystem processes the model parameter values applied to large areas often shift from the laboratory or field measurements mo et al 2008 models that have not been accurately parameterized and calibrated would propagate modeling biases through time pan and wood 2006 the traditional methods of model parameter optimization were usually based on bayesian estimation or multi criteria approach assuming temporally invariant parameters braswell et al 2005 knorr and kattge 2005 these approaches not only ignored the possible temporal variations in model parameters but also require a long historical dataset moradkhani et al 2005 to overcome these disadvantages model data assimilation techniques combine model parameters observations and prior estimates of model states to update model predictions based on the constraint of time series of observations considering the uncertainties from parameter biases and measurement errors as well as model structure moradkhani et al 2005 as one of the sequential model data assimilation techniques the kalman filter provides a general framework for optimal constraint of model prediction with observations mo et al 2008 the kalman filter can track the temporal variations in parameters with multiple observations and it considers the model structural error parameter error input data error and observational error as a recursive procedure the kalman filter generates one step ahead predictions and updates the system state variables at anytime when observations are available pastres et al 2003 the ensemble kalman filter enkf is an extension of the traditional kalman filter and is monte carlo based and recursive data processing leading to optimal estimation of non linear dynamic systems with gaussian probabilities evensen 2003 model data assimilation can improve the treatment of uncertainties in ecosystem simulation through recursively updating model states and parameters where all sources of uncertainties are explicitly considered mo et al 2008 ju et al 2010 in the last decade field measurements of ecosystem cos fluxes have been conducted over different vegetation types including evergreen needleleaf forests kooijmans et al 2017 l m j 2019 deciduous broadleaf forests commane et al 2015 wehr et al 2017 spielmann et al 2019 grasslands berkelhammer et al 2020 spielmann et al 2020 and crop fields asaf et al 2013 maseyk et al 2014 the availability of eddy covariance ec measurements of cos co2 water and energy fluxes in different terrestrial ecosystems provides opportunities to optimize model parameters to which simulated cos co2 water and energy fluxes are sensitive there are many parameters in a complex tem and some parameters are compensating with each other thus the model parameters may be over fitted or under fitted with the ec flux measurements mo et al 2008 continuous ec fluxes have been used to investigate the magnitude and seasonal variations in several key parameters in tems related to the carbon and water cycle mo et al 2008 ju et al 2010 it was found that the optimized parameters i e leaf clumping index leaf maximum carboxylation rate and the slope of the ball woodrow berry stomatal conductance model varied distinctly at seasonal and inter annual scales mo et al 2008 and the enkf parameter optimization improved the simulations of gross primary productivity gpp latent heat le and sensible heat sh fluxes ju et al 2010 however the leaf cos uptake rate and the related parameters in tems have not been optimized using enkf in the previous studies to account for the seasonal variations of the key model parameters ec measured cos co2 and water fluxes data from a boreal pine forest and a temperate deciduous broadleaf forest were assimilated into the boreal ecosystem productivity simulator beps with an enkf in this study the model behavior would change over time due to the evolution of vegetation that depends on environmental variables thus it is essential to recursively optimize the parameters for improving the simulated canopy cos fluxes so that the temporal variations of parameters can be detected when the model is run forward in time the beps model was first improved to simulate canopy cos uptake rates two parameters related to leaf photosynthesis and cos uptake rate were optimized recursively using the enkf by this way the seasonal and interannual variations of these parameters were estimated and the improvements of the model performance were also evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description two mature forest sites where continuous measurements of cos fluxes had been made for several years were selected for this

description gpp and canopy carbonyl sulfide uptake were simulated using the boreal ecosystem productivity simulator beps chen et al 1999 b 2019 at half hourly time steps the beps model used in this study is a two leaf enzyme kinetic terrestrial ecosystem model including a module for leaf photosynthesis and stomatal conductance calculations chen et al 2012 b 2019 a two leaf module for canopy radiation transfer chen et al 1999 and a land surface scheme for simulating sensible and latent heat fluxes and soil hydrothermal processes ju et al 2006 liu et al 2021 in beps gpp is simulated by upscaling leaf level photosynthesis rates modeled by the farquhar von caemmerer and berry fvcb photosynthetic model farquhar et al 1980 to canopy level based on a sunlit and shaded leaves separation scheme chen et al 1999 water and energy fluxes are also simulated separately for sunlit and shaded leaves in beps the canopy level gpp is simulated as chen et al 1999 1 g p p a s u n l a i s u n a s h l a i s h where the subscripts sun and sh represent the sunlit and shaded leaves a is the leaf level net photosynthesis rate μ m o l m 2 s 1 the sunlit lai l a i s u n and shaded lai l a i s h are calculated as chen et al 1999 2 l a i s u n 2 c o s θ 1 e 0 5 ω l c o s θ 3 l a i s h l l a i s u n where θ is solar zenith angle and l is leaf area index m2 m 2 2 4 model improvements in this study cos plant uptake from the sib3 model berry et al 2013 was incorporated into the coupled photosynthesis and stomatal conductance module of the beps model and the canopy level cos plant uptake rate f cos v e g in pmol m 2 s 1 can be calculated as 4 f cos v e g f c o s l s u n l a i s u n f c o s l s h l a i s h where f c o s l s u n and f c o s l s h are leaf level cos uptake rate pmol m 2 s 1 for

where c o s a is atmospheric cos concentration pmol mol 1 g b w is leaf boundary layer conductance to water vapor mol m 2 s 1 and g c o s is the apparent conductance for cos uptake from the intercellular airspace and it is the combination of mesophyll conductance and ca activity g c o s is proportional to v c m a x as berry et al 2013 6 g c o s α v c m a x where α is a calibration term added to scale g c o s to v c m a x stimler et al 2010 stimler et al 2012 the key leaf biochemical parameters related to photosynthesis and leaf cos uptake in the beps model were shown in table 2 2 5 assimilation method the purpose of data assimilation is to produce the best analysis of the model states or parameters and find the model representation that is most consistent with measurements through combining incomplete and inaccurate observations with output from an imperfect model mo et al 2008 in this study parameter optimization of the beps model was conducted using a dual state parameter estimation approach based on the enkf moradkhani et al 2005 mo et al 2008 ju et al 2010 the parameter ensemble members were updated as ju et al 2010 7 θ t 1 i θ t 1 i k t 1 θ y t 1 i y t 1 i where θ t 1 i is the updated parameter ensemble member at time step t 1 k t 1 θ is the kalman gain for parameter correction y t 1 i and y t 1 i are the ensemble members of measurements and predictions respectively θ t 1 i are the parameter samples and they could be obtained as mo et al 2008 8 θ t 1 i θ t i τ t i where τ t i is the random white noise error at time step t in eq 7 the kalman gain matrix k t 1 θ is calculated as ju et al 2010 9 k t 1 θ σ t 1 θ y σ t 1 y y σ t 1 y 1 where σ t 1 θ y is the cross covariance of parameter ensemble and prediction ensemble σ t 1 y y is the error covariance matrix of the prediction y t 1 i σ t 1 y is the error covariance of observation 2 6 parameter selection and ensemble generation through sensitivity analysis appendix b two most sensitive parameters which directly related to photosynthesis and leaf cos uptake were selected for optimization the two parameters were leaf maximum carboxylation rate at 25 c at top of canopy v c m a x 25 0 and the calibration term used to scale g c o s to v c m a x α the standard deviations and ranges of the parameters were listed in table 3 the ensemble members of predicted gpp le and fcos veg were generated by adjusting the parameters using eq 8 the uncertainties of gpp le and fcos veg measurements were set as 15 of their daily averages and assumed to be independent of each other ju et al 2010 kohonen et al 2020 the ensemble size was set as 200 for the correct estimation of the error variance in the predicted model state mo et al 2008 the sequential data assimilation was conducted daily so that the parameters were updated at the end of each day based on the predicted daily averages of model states and daily averages of measured fluxes 3 results 3 1 seasonal variations of the optimized parameters in the enkf data assimilation the parameters were updated daily through adding up the corrections then the new parameter values were used to calculate the fluxes of the next day for the two studied sites the two sensitive parameters v c m a x 25 0 and α related to gpp and fcos veg were retrieved during the growing seasons when the measured flux data gpp le and fcos veg were available the seasonal variations in the optimized parameters were demonstrated with 10 day averages to remove the fluctuations of the retrieved parameters at daily steps v c m a x 25 0 represents the leaf photosynthetic capacity at reference temperature 25 c which was found to be linearly correlated with leaf chlorophyll content chlleaf holly croft et al 2017 chou et al 2020 leaf biochemistry measurements in a mixed temperate forest showed that chlleaf and v c m a x 25 0 increased slowly at the start of the growing season until values stabilized in the middle of the growing season and decreasing during leaf senescence holly croft et al 2017 in fig 2 the values of v c m a x 25 0 retrieved for the us ha1 site in 2012 and 2013 showed considerable seasonal variations v c m a x 25 0 at the us ha1 site increased rapidly at the start of the growing season and reached the peaks in late june figs 2a and 2b the variations of v c m a x 25 0 were relatively small during the middle of growing season and decreased to low values when leaves started to senescence figs 2a and 2b in addition the small decreases of v c m a x 25 0 at us ha1 site in the middle of the growing seasons in 2012 and 2013 were associated with the decline of soil moisture figs 2a and 2b at the fi hyy site v c m a x 25 0 showed increasing trends in the spring and a noticeable decline with the decrease of soil moisture sm during the summer drought periods in 2013 2014 and 2015 figs 2c 2d and 2e in 2016 and 2017 there was no drought in summer sm 0 2 m3 m 3 at fi hyy site and v c m a x 25 0 increased slowly at the start of the growing season until values stabilized in the end of summer figs 2f and 2g α is a calibration term used to scale g c o s to v c m a x in the beps model and the initial value of α was set as 1200 for c3 species berry et al 2013 the mean optimized α at the two studied sites during the growing seasons of the studied years was 1212 fig 3 which was close to the initial calibration value 1200 by berry et al 2013 based on laboratory leaf gas exchange measurements meanwhile it was found that the optimized α varied in time and between sites fig 3 the mean optimized α were 928 and 1495 at us ha1 site and fi hyy site respectively also the optimized α decreased with the decrease of soil moisture at us ha1 site in early summers of 2012 and 2013 as well as at fi hyy site in middle summers of 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively figs 3a 3e these indicated that a constant α value could not capture the variations in measured f cos v e g across sites and seasons 3 2 interannual variations of optimized parameters the optimized parameters averaged over each year at the fi hyy site were shown in fig 4 the interannual variations of optimized parameters at the us ha1 site were not shown here because there are only two years data available at the us ha1 site the optimized v c m a x 25 0 and α exhibited noticeable interannual variations at the fi hyy site fig 4 the optimized v c m a x 25 0 increased from 28 36 11 37 μ m o l m 2 s 1 in 2013 to 41 47 4 78 μ m o l m 2 s 1 in 2017 with an average of 34 34 μ m o l m 2 s 1 at fi hyy site during 2013 2017 fig 4a the calibration term α at the fi hyy site also showed interannual variability ranging from 1361 348 to 1863 696 at the fi hyy site during 2013 2017 fig 4b the interannual variations of α at the fi hyy site were smaller than their seasonal variations 3 3 performance of enkf in flux simulation because gpp le and canopy level cos plant uptake rate fcos veg were modeled with the updated parameter values on the previous day the performance of enkf in improving flux estimation could be evaluated by comparing simulated and measured fluxes figs 5 and 6 show the comparisons between ensemble predicted and observed daily gpp le and fcos veg at us ha1 and fi hyy sites respectively the modeled fluxes were the averages of 200 ensemble predictions using the optimized parameters the beps model explained 86 68 and 55 of variations of measured daily gpp le and fcos veg at us ha1 site during 2012 to 2013 fig 5 at fi hyy site the optimized beps model captured 90 74 and 69 of variations in the measurements of gpp le and fcos veg during 2013 to 2017 fig 6 most of these results were significantly improvements over those simulated with calibrated parameters us ha1 v c m a x 25 0 51 5 μ m o l m 2 s 1 α 1200 fi hyy v c m a x 25 0 62 5 μ m o l m 2 s 1 α 1200 table 4 the largest improvement was achieved for fcos veg followed by gpp and le the rmse values of fcos veg with enkf parameter optimization decreased to 6 00 and 3 57 pmol m 2 s 1 at us ha1 and fi hyy sites respectively from 9 85 and 7 94 pmol m 2 s 1 using the calibrated parameter values similarly the enkf parameter optimization made the rmse of gpp decrease from 7 47 to 3 69 μ m o l m 2 s 1 at us ha1 site and from 7 59 to 1 81 μ m o l m 2 s 1 at fi hyy site table 2 3 4 estimation of canopy cos uptake rate daily fcos veg simulated by the beps model using parameters optimized by enkf and parameters determined by model calibration were compared with ec measurements to see the ability of the improved beps model in capturing day to day variation of fcos veg during the growing seasons at the two studied sites fig 7 at us ha1 site the simulation of optimized parameters can capture the day to day variation of fcos veg well during most of the growing seasons in 2012 and 2013 while fcos veg were overestimated by the simulation of calibrated parameters compared to the ec measurements during most of the growing seasons in 2012 and 2013 figs 7a and 7b at fi hyy site the simulation using the enkf optimized parameters also performed better than that using the calibrated parameters in capturing the day to day variation of fcos veg during the growing seasons of 2013 to 2017 fig 7c to 7g 4 discussion parameters in ecosystem models usually vary spatially and temporally in nonlinear forms mo et al 2008 ju et al 2010 parameter values derived from measurements at one scale leaf or canopy may not be applied to another scale ec measurements represent fluxes at the footprint distance of 100 1000 m chen et al 2009 ju et al 2010 similar to the spatial resolution of many satellite remote sensing data thus parameter values optimized with ec measured flux data will improve the model performance in simulating fluxes at regional to global scales many studies have used ec measurements to optimize model parameters verbeeck et al 2011 kuppel et al 2012 santaren et al 2014 wu et al 2020 enkf is a sequential data assimilation technique that can be used to retrieve the seasonal variations of key ecosystem model parameters such as photosynthetic capacity indicated by vcmax and jmax mo et al 2008 ju et al 2010 the estimation of measurement errors is important for the enkf parameter optimization algorithm the measurement errors used in the calculation of kalman gain matrix affect the extent to which the trajectories of optimized parameters would be corrected evensen 2003 ju et al 2010 in this study the measurement errors of gpp le and fcos veg were set as 15 of their daily values which were in the range of reported uncertainties of gpp le and cos flux measurements richardson et al 2008 kohonen et al 2020 large seasonal variations in v c m a x 25 0 were also derived by assimilating ec measurements using enkf in the previous studies on a boreal deciduous broadleaf forest mo et al 2008 and a subtropical evergreen conifer forest ju et al 2010 many possible mechanisms could cause the variations in v c m a x 25 0 changes in photosynthetic enzyme activities leaf nitrogen content leaf chlorophyll content leaf age and soil water stress might cause the seasonal and interannual variations of v c m a x 25 0 holly croft et al 2017 miner et al 2017 wang et al 2020 model structure and parameter optimization methods can also cause the temporal changes of optimized parameters carvalhais et al 2008 in this study we assumed that the model structure of the improved beps model as well as the enkf data assimilation method were reasonable the robustness of this assumption needs further investigation the seasonal variations of fcos veg simulated by the improved beps model using enkf in this study were similar to the results modeled by the simple biosphere model version 4 sib4 both of them can capture the seasonal variations in monthly averaged observations fig 8 however the beps simulated fcos veg were much closer to the observations while the sib4 simulated fcos veg were underestimated compared to the observations fig 8 therefore the parameter optimization using enkf could significantly improve the performance of ecosystem models in simulating fcos veg 5 conclusion from this study the major conclusions were drawn as follows 1 the enkf data assimilation is an effective method for parameter optimization of ecosystem models it can track the seasonal and interannual variations of the model parameters the quality of observation data and the estimations of observation errors can both affect the optimized parameter values 2 the optimized v c m a x 25 0 and α demonstrated considerable seasonal variations at the two studied sites also the optimized v c m a x 25 0 and α exhibited noticeable interannual variations at the fi hyy site the interannual variations of α at the fi hyy site were smaller than their seasonal variations 3 with parameter optimization using enkf the improved beps model could explain 86 68 and 55 of variations in measured daily gpp le

simulations with the calibrated parameters the simulations with the enkf parameter optimization significantly improve the beps model performance in simulating gpp le and fcos veg 4 the simulated daily fcos veg with the parameters optimized using enkf could capture the day to day variations of fcos veg at the two studied sites and performed better than the simulations with calibrated parameter values the impacts of model structure and different parameter optimization methods on the optimized parameter values were not investigated in this study also the observation uncertainties include two components such as random errors and systematic errors in this study we only considered the random components of the observation errors in the future these issues need to be investigated for better identifying the underlying mechanisms of the temporal variations in model parameters code availability the code for the enkf version of the beps model is available at https github com chenbin19811003

24306,the uptake of carbonyl sulfide cos by plant canopy closely correlated with photosynthetic co2 uptake as they share the same diffusion pathway process based ecosystem models have been used to simulate the co2 h2o and cos fluxes between terrestrial ecosystems and atmosphere some model parameters often vary seasonally and interannually in this study the hourly boreal ecosystem productivity simulator beps was first improved to simulate the canopy cos uptake rate then an ensemble kalman filter was designed to optimize the key parameters of the hourly beps model considering the errors in the input parameters and measurements the optimized parameters include leaf maximum carboxylation rate at 25 c at top of canopy v c m a x 25 0 and a calibration term α used to scale the apparent conductance for cos uptake from the intercellular airspace g c o s to v c m a x the fluxes of gross primary productivity gpp latent heat le and cos uptake by canopy fcos veg measured using eddy covariance method at a temperate deciduous forest during 2012 2013 and a boreal conifer forest during 2013 2017 were used for data assimilation parameters were optimized daily and presented as 10 day averages it was found that the parameters showed considerable seasonally and interannually variations with parameter optimization using enkf the improved hourly beps model could explain 86 68 and 55 of variations in measured daily gpp le and fcos veg at us ha1 site during 2012 and 2013 and captured 90 74 and 69 of variations in the measured gpp le and fcos veg at fi hyy site during 2013 2017 respectively the simulated daily fcos veg with the parameters optimized using enkf could capture the day to day variations of fcos veg at the two studied sites and performed better than the simulations with calibrated parameter values further efforts were required to investigate the impacts of model structure and different parameter optimization methods on the optimized parameter values keywords carbonyl sulfide ensemble kalman filter parameter optimization data assimilation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction carbonyl sulfide ocs or cos hereafter cos is an atmospheric trace gasses 500 ppt that is promising for studies of carbon and water cycles montzka et al 2007 wohlfahrt et al 2012 cos uptake by the terrestrial ecosystems is the main sink of atmospheric cos whelan et al 2018 cos shares the same diffusion pathway into the leaf chloroplasts as co2 and is hydrolyzed completely by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase ca and is not emitted protoschill krebs et al 1996 this one way irreversible flux can be used to estimate photosynthetic uptake of co2 stomatal conductance and other leaf physiological parameters at spatiotemporal scales that are difficult to measure whelan et al 2018 using cos as a constraint on the carbon and water fluxes in terrestrial ecosystem models tems needs an accurate representation of ecosystem cos fluxes in models ecosystem cos fluxes have been implemented in tems such as the simple biosphere model version 3 sib3 berry et al 2013 organising carbon and hydrology in dynamic ecosystems orchidee maignan 2021 and the simple biosphere model version 4 sib4 kooijmans et al 2021 which are useful tools to estimate the cos fluxes between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere at site regional and global scales however estimates of global terrestrial ecosystem cos fluxes from the models were quite different ranging from 753 to 1845 gg s yr 1 kooijmans et al 2021 a source of uncertainty for simulating cos fluxes by ecosystem models is the model parameterization due to the complexity and spatiotemporal variations of ecosystem processes the model parameter values applied to large areas often shift from the laboratory or field measurements mo et al 2008 models that have not been accurately parameterized and calibrated would propagate modeling biases through time pan and wood 2006 the traditional methods of model parameter optimization were usually based on bayesian estimation or multi criteria approach assuming temporally invariant parameters braswell et al 2005 knorr and kattge 2005 these approaches not only ignored the possible temporal variations in model parameters but also require a long historical dataset moradkhani et al 2005 to overcome these disadvantages model data assimilation techniques combine model parameters observations and prior estimates of model states to update model predictions based on the constraint of time series of observations considering the uncertainties from parameter biases and measurement errors as well as model structure moradkhani et al 2005 as one of the sequential model data assimilation techniques the kalman filter provides a general framework for optimal constraint of model prediction with observations mo et al 2008 the kalman filter can track the temporal variations in parameters with multiple observations and it considers the model structural error parameter error input data error and observational error as a recursive procedure the kalman filter generates one step ahead predictions and updates the system state variables at anytime when observations are available pastres et al 2003 the ensemble kalman filter enkf is an extension of the traditional kalman filter and is monte carlo based and recursive data processing leading to optimal estimation of non linear dynamic systems with gaussian probabilities evensen 2003 model data assimilation can improve the treatment of uncertainties in ecosystem simulation through recursively updating model states and parameters where all sources of uncertainties are explicitly considered mo et al 2008 ju et al 2010 in the last decade field measurements of ecosystem cos fluxes have been conducted over different vegetation types including evergreen needleleaf forests kooijmans et al 2017 l m j 2019 deciduous broadleaf forests commane et al 2015 wehr et al 2017 spielmann et al 2019 grasslands berkelhammer et al 2020 spielmann et al 2020 and crop fields asaf et al 2013 maseyk et al 2014 the availability of eddy covariance ec measurements of cos co2 water and energy fluxes in different terrestrial ecosystems provides opportunities to optimize model parameters to which simulated cos co2 water and energy fluxes are sensitive there are many parameters in a complex tem and some parameters are compensating with each other thus the model parameters may be over fitted or under fitted with the ec flux measurements mo et al 2008 continuous ec fluxes have been used to investigate the magnitude and seasonal variations in several key parameters in tems related to the carbon and water cycle mo et al 2008 ju et al 2010 it was found that the optimized parameters i e leaf clumping index leaf maximum carboxylation rate and the slope of the ball woodrow berry stomatal conductance model varied distinctly at seasonal and inter annual scales mo et al 2008 and the enkf parameter optimization improved the simulations of gross primary productivity gpp latent heat le and sensible heat sh fluxes ju et al 2010 however the leaf cos uptake rate and the related parameters in tems have not been optimized using enkf in the previous studies to account for the seasonal variations of the key model parameters ec measured cos co2 and water fluxes data from a boreal pine forest and a temperate deciduous broadleaf forest were assimilated into the boreal ecosystem productivity simulator beps with an enkf in this study the model behavior would change over time due to the evolution of vegetation that depends on environmental variables thus it is essential to recursively optimize the parameters for improving the simulated canopy cos fluxes so that the temporal variations of parameters can be detected when the model is run forward in time the beps model was first improved to simulate canopy cos uptake rates two parameters related to leaf photosynthesis and cos uptake rate were optimized recursively using the enkf by this way the seasonal and interannual variations of these parameters were estimated and the improvements of the model performance were also evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description two mature forest sites where continuous measurements of cos fluxes had been made for several years were selected for this

study is a two leaf enzyme kinetic terrestrial ecosystem model including a module for leaf photosynthesis and stomatal conductance calculations chen et al 2012 b 2019 a two leaf module for canopy radiation transfer chen et al 1999 and a land surface scheme for simulating sensible and latent heat fluxes and soil hydrothermal processes ju et al 2006 liu et al 2021 in beps gpp is simulated by upscaling leaf level photosynthesis rates modeled by the farquhar von caemmerer and berry fvcb photosynthetic model farquhar et al 1980 to canopy level based on a sunlit and shaded leaves separation scheme chen et al 1999 water and energy fluxes are also simulated separately for sunlit and shaded leaves in beps the canopy level gpp is simulated as chen et al 1999 1 g p p a s u n l a i s u n a s h

cos plant uptake from the sib3 model berry et al 2013 was incorporated into the coupled photosynthesis and stomatal conductance module of the beps model and the canopy level cos plant uptake rate f cos v e g in pmol m 2 s 1 can be calculated as 4 f cos v e g f c o s l s u n l a i s u n f c o s l s h l a i s h where f c o s l s u n and f c o s l s h are leaf level cos uptake rate pmol m 2 s 1 for

added to scale g c o s to v c m a x stimler et al 2010 stimler et al 2012 the key leaf biochemical parameters related to photosynthesis and leaf cos uptake in the beps model were shown in table 2 2 5 assimilation method the purpose of data assimilation is to produce the best analysis of the model states or parameters and find the model representation that is most consistent with measurements through combining incomplete and inaccurate observations with output from an imperfect model mo et al 2008 in this study parameter optimization of the beps model was conducted using a dual state parameter estimation approach based on the enkf moradkhani et al 2005 mo et al 2008 ju et al 2010 the parameter ensemble members were updated as ju et al 2010 7 θ t 1 i θ t 1 i k t 1 θ y t 1 i y t 1 i where θ t 1 i is the updated parameter ensemble member at time step t 1 k t 1 θ is the kalman gain for parameter correction y t 1 i and y t 1 i are the ensemble members of measurements and predictions respectively θ t 1 i are the parameter samples and they could be obtained as mo et al 2008 8 θ t 1 i θ t i τ t i where τ t i is the random white noise error at time step t in eq 7 the kalman gain matrix k t 1 θ is calculated as ju et al 2010 9 k t 1 θ σ t 1 θ y σ t 1 y y σ t 1 y 1 where σ t 1 θ y is the cross covariance of parameter ensemble and prediction ensemble σ t 1 y y is the error covariance matrix of the prediction y t 1 i σ t 1 y is the error covariance of observation 2 6 parameter selection and ensemble generation through sensitivity analysis appendix b two most sensitive parameters which directly related to photosynthesis and leaf cos uptake were selected for optimization the two parameters were leaf maximum carboxylation rate at 25 c at top of canopy v c m a x 25 0 and the calibration term used to scale g c o s to v c m a x α the standard deviations and ranges of the parameters were listed in table 3 the ensemble members of predicted gpp le and fcos veg were generated by adjusting the parameters using eq 8 the uncertainties of gpp le and fcos veg measurements were set as 15 of their daily averages and assumed to be independent of each other ju et al 2010 kohonen et al 2020 the ensemble size was set as 200 for the correct estimation of the error variance in the predicted model state mo et al 2008 the sequential data assimilation was conducted daily so that the parameters were updated at the end of each day based on the predicted daily averages of model states and daily averages of measured fluxes 3 results 3 1 seasonal variations of the optimized parameters in the enkf data assimilation the parameters were updated daily through adding up the corrections then the new parameter values were used to calculate the fluxes of the next day for the two studied sites the two sensitive parameters v c m a x 25 0 and α related to gpp and fcos veg were retrieved during the growing seasons when the measured flux data gpp le and fcos veg were available the seasonal variations in the optimized parameters were demonstrated with 10 day averages to remove the fluctuations of the retrieved parameters at daily steps v c m a x 25 0 represents the leaf photosynthetic capacity at reference temperature 25 c which was found to be linearly correlated with leaf chlorophyll content chlleaf holly croft et al 2017 chou et al 2020 leaf biochemistry measurements in a mixed temperate forest showed that chlleaf and v c m a x 25 0 increased slowly at the start of the growing season until values stabilized in the middle of the growing season and decreasing during leaf senescence holly croft et al 2017 in fig 2 the values of v c m a x 25 0 retrieved for the us ha1 site in 2012 and 2013 showed considerable seasonal variations v c m a x 25 0 at the us ha1 site increased rapidly at the start of the growing season and reached the peaks in late june figs 2a and 2b the variations of v c m a x 25 0 were relatively small during the middle of growing season and decreased to low values when leaves started to senescence figs 2a and 2b in addition the small decreases of v c m a x 25 0 at us ha1 site in the middle of the growing seasons in 2012 and 2013 were associated with the decline of soil moisture figs 2a and 2b at the fi hyy site v c m a x 25 0 showed increasing trends in the spring and a noticeable decline with the decrease of soil moisture sm during the summer drought periods in 2013 2014 and 2015 figs 2c 2d and 2e in 2016 and 2017 there was no drought in summer sm 0 2 m3 m 3 at fi hyy site and v c m a x 25 0 increased slowly at the start of the growing season until values stabilized in the end of summer figs 2f and 2g α is a calibration term used to scale g c o s to v c m a x in the beps model and the initial value of α was set as 1200 for c3 species berry et al 2013 the mean optimized α at the two studied sites during the growing seasons of the studied years was 1212 fig 3 which was close to the initial calibration value 1200 by berry et al 2013 based on laboratory leaf gas exchange measurements meanwhile it was found that the optimized α varied in time and between sites fig 3 the mean optimized α were 928 and 1495 at us ha1 site and fi hyy site respectively also the optimized α decreased with the decrease of soil moisture at us ha1 site in early summers of 2012 and 2013 as well as at fi hyy site in middle summers of 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively figs 3a 3e these indicated that a constant α value could not capture the variations in measured f cos v e g across sites and seasons 3 2 interannual variations of optimized parameters the optimized parameters averaged over each year at the fi hyy site were shown in fig 4 the interannual variations of optimized parameters at the us ha1 site were not shown here because there are only two years data available at the us ha1 site the optimized v c m a x 25 0 and α exhibited noticeable interannual variations at the fi hyy site fig 4 the optimized v c m a x 25 0 increased from 28 36 11 37 μ m o l m 2 s 1 in 2013 to 41 47 4 78 μ m o l m 2 s 1 in 2017 with an average of 34 34 μ m o l m 2 s 1 at fi hyy site during 2013 2017 fig 4a the calibration term α at the fi hyy site also showed interannual variability ranging from 1361 348 to 1863 696 at the fi hyy site during 2013 2017 fig 4b the interannual variations of α at the fi hyy site were smaller than their seasonal variations 3 3 performance of enkf in flux simulation because gpp le and canopy level cos plant uptake rate fcos veg were modeled with the updated parameter values on the previous day the performance of enkf in improving flux estimation could be evaluated by comparing simulated and measured fluxes figs 5 and 6 show the comparisons between ensemble predicted and observed daily gpp le and fcos veg at us ha1 and fi hyy sites respectively the modeled fluxes were the averages of 200 ensemble predictions using the optimized parameters the beps model explained 86 68 and 55 of variations of measured daily gpp le and fcos veg at us ha1 site during 2012 to 2013 fig 5 at fi hyy site the optimized beps model captured 90 74 and 69 of variations in the measurements of gpp le and fcos veg during 2013 to 2017 fig 6 most of these results were significantly improvements over those simulated with calibrated parameters us ha1 v c m a x 25 0 51 5 μ m o l m 2 s 1 α 1200 fi hyy v c m a x 25 0 62 5 μ m o l m 2 s 1 α 1200 table 4 the largest improvement was achieved for fcos veg followed by gpp and le the rmse values of fcos veg with enkf parameter optimization decreased to 6 00 and 3 57 pmol m 2 s 1 at us ha1 and fi hyy sites respectively from 9 85 and 7 94 pmol m 2 s 1 using the calibrated parameter values similarly the enkf parameter optimization made the rmse of gpp decrease from 7 47 to 3 69 μ m o l m 2 s 1 at us ha1 site and from 7 59 to 1 81 μ m o l m 2 s 1 at fi hyy site table 2 3 4 estimation of canopy cos uptake rate daily fcos veg simulated by the beps model using parameters optimized by enkf and parameters determined by model calibration were compared with ec measurements to see the ability of the improved beps model in capturing day to day variation of fcos veg during the growing seasons at the two studied sites fig 7 at us ha1 site the simulation of optimized parameters can capture the day to day variation of fcos veg well during most of the growing seasons in 2012 and 2013 while fcos veg were overestimated by the simulation of calibrated parameters compared to the ec measurements during most of the growing seasons in 2012 and 2013 figs 7a and 7b at fi hyy site the simulation using the enkf optimized parameters also performed better than that using the calibrated parameters in capturing the day to day variation of fcos veg during the growing seasons of 2013 to 2017 fig 7c to 7g 4 discussion parameters in ecosystem models usually vary spatially and temporally in nonlinear forms mo et al 2008 ju et al 2010 parameter values derived from measurements at one scale leaf or canopy may not be applied to another scale ec measurements represent fluxes at the footprint distance of 100 1000 m chen et al 2009 ju et al 2010 similar to the spatial resolution of many satellite remote sensing data thus parameter values optimized with ec measured flux data will improve the model performance in simulating fluxes at regional to global scales many studies have used ec measurements to optimize model parameters verbeeck et al 2011 kuppel et al 2012 santaren et al 2014 wu et al 2020 enkf is a sequential data assimilation technique that can be used to retrieve the seasonal variations of key ecosystem model parameters such as photosynthetic capacity indicated by vcmax and jmax mo et al 2008 ju et al 2010 the estimation of measurement errors is important for the enkf parameter optimization algorithm the measurement errors used in the calculation of kalman gain matrix affect the extent to which the trajectories of optimized parameters would be corrected evensen 2003 ju et al 2010 in this study the measurement errors of gpp le and fcos veg were set as 15 of their daily values which were in the range of reported uncertainties of gpp le and cos flux measurements richardson et al 2008 kohonen et al 2020 large seasonal variations in v c m a x 25 0 were also derived by assimilating ec measurements using enkf in the previous studies on a boreal deciduous broadleaf forest mo et al 2008 and a subtropical evergreen conifer forest ju et al 2010 many possible mechanisms could cause the variations in v c m a x 25 0 changes in photosynthetic enzyme activities leaf nitrogen content leaf chlorophyll content leaf age and soil water stress might cause the seasonal and interannual variations of v c m a x 25 0 holly croft et al 2017 miner et al 2017 wang et al 2020 model structure and parameter optimization methods can also cause the temporal changes of optimized parameters carvalhais et al 2008 in this study we assumed that the model structure of the improved beps model as well as the enkf data assimilation method were reasonable the robustness of this assumption needs further investigation the seasonal variations of fcos veg simulated by the improved beps model using enkf in this study were similar to the results modeled by the simple biosphere model version 4 sib4 both of them can capture the seasonal variations in monthly averaged observations fig 8 however the beps simulated fcos veg were much closer to the observations while the sib4 simulated fcos veg were underestimated compared to the observations fig 8 therefore the parameter optimization using enkf could significantly improve the performance of ecosystem models in simulating fcos veg 5 conclusion from this study the major conclusions were drawn as follows 1 the enkf data assimilation is an effective method for parameter optimization of ecosystem models it can track the seasonal and interannual variations of the model parameters the quality of observation data and the estimations of observation errors can both affect the optimized parameter values 2 the optimized v c m a x 25 0 and α demonstrated considerable seasonal variations at the two studied sites also the optimized v c m a x 25 0 and α exhibited noticeable interannual variations at the fi hyy site the interannual variations of α at the fi hyy site were smaller than their seasonal variations 3 with parameter optimization using enkf the improved beps model could explain 86 68 and 55 of variations in measured daily gpp le and fcos veg at us ha1 site during 2012 and 2013 and captured 90 74 and 69 of variations in the measurements of gpp le and fcos veg at fi hyy site during 2013 to 2017 respectively compared to the simulations with the calibrated parameters the simulations with the enkf parameter optimization significantly improve the beps model performance in simulating gpp le and fcos veg 4 the simulated daily fcos veg with the parameters optimized using enkf could capture the day to day variations of fcos veg at the two studied sites and performed better than the simulations with calibrated parameter values the impacts of model structure and different parameter optimization methods on the optimized parameter values were not investigated in this study also the observation uncertainties include two components such as random errors and systematic errors in this study we only considered the random components of the observation errors in the future these issues need to be investigated for better identifying the underlying mechanisms of the temporal variations in model parameters code availability the code for the enkf version of the beps model is available at https github com chenbin19811003

24307,to help better interpret computational models in predicting drift of carp eggs in rivers we present a series of model assessments for the longitudinal egg dispersion two three dimensional lagrangian particle tracking models sdrift and fluegg are evaluated in a series of channels with increasing complexity the model evaluation demonstrates that both models are able to accommodate channel complexity and provide a wide range of dispersion coefficients k l o 1 100 h u with h being water depth and u being shear velocity in a straight channel with k l o 1 h u sdrift predicts weaker longitudinal dispersion than fluegg in the early stage as a result of weak vertical mixing associated with smooth wall turbulence with sufficient time sdrift and fluegg predict similar egg dispersion accounting for the differential advection due to the vertical velocity profile in an idealized curved channel with k l o 10 h u dispersion is driven by both vertical and transverse velocity profiles sdrift yields slightly larger dispersion coefficients than fluegg in a real river with channel training structures and having k l o 100 h u sdrift predicts a stronger longitudinal dispersion than fluegg due to substantial local turbulent eddies and velocity gradients to summarize fluegg shows good performance in capturing dispersion due to vertical velocity profiles and cross channel velocity gradients sdrift shows excellent model capabilities of revealing various dispersion mechanisms in addition to the vertical and cross channel velocity variations they include the initial turbulent diffusion stage with growing dispersion coefficients and strong dispersion due to in stream hydraulic structures and localized turbulence data availability the data has been released in an online database 1 introduction grass carp ctenopharyngodon idella bighead carp hypophthalmichthys nobilis and silver carp h molitrix are native to asia where they support important fisheries but they are invasive in north america food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2020 chapman et al 2016 irons et al 2007 cudmore et al 2012 chick et al 2020 whether they are considered as an important food source or an invasive species understanding the process of carp spawning and recruitment in their natural habitats is an important topic to aquatic ecology fisheries economics and engineering for water resources management egg drift is a critical life cycle stage that is highly influenced by characteristics of river flows the carps are rheophilic spawning in turbulence zones of rivers yih and liang 1964 jennings 1988 prada et al 2020 the eggs are released into the water column and develop while drifting downstream settling to the bottom where they are likely to be covered by sediment is detrimental to egg survival george and chapman 2015 the initial diameter of carp eggs is about 1 to 2 mm with settling velocities of approximately 2 cm s george et al 2017 depending on temperature within approximately 3 to 5 h eggs absorb large amounts of water and become 5 to 7 mm in diameter george et al 2017 during this process known as water hardening their densities reach an equilibrium value close to water density as such the egg settling velocity is reduced by approximately 70 which allows them to be better suspended by turbulence while drifting downstream garcia et al 2016 on river scales lagrangian particle tracking lpt models have been useful and effective in predicting transport of carp eggs notably fluegg is a widely used three dimensional 3 d lpt model that incorporates one dimensional 1 d hydrodynamic data garcia et al 2013 2015 in recent years there have been increasing numbers of studies using 3 d hydrodynamic models to help better understand the effect of turbulence on egg transport heer et al 2020 2021 river turbulence plays an important role in nursing carp eggs it helps keep eggs suspended and controls transport distance which determines the timing and locations of hatching garcia et al 2015 heer et al 2020 2021 in addition turbulence also affects the swimming behavior of carp larvae prada et al 2020 2021 to further understand the role of turbulence on egg drift we developed a new lpt model using the solution of stochastic differential equations for simulating realistic turbulent velocities li et al 2022 this 3 d stochastic drift model sdrift is shown to be able to capture the correlated turbulent velocities over the lifetime of turbulent eddies the major advantage of using 3 d hydrodynamic data to drive an egg drift model is the ability to capture the effects of localized turbulence for instance the strong spatial variability and eddies induced by in stream structures and complex river bed morphology heer et al 2020 2021 li et al 2022 although 3 d hydrodynamics models have clear advantages in resolving spatial hydraulic information models with simpler parameterizations may be useful and more cost effective in a variety of fluvial systems from very simple channels to natural rivers here we present a series of assessments and comparisons between two lpt models sdrift and fluegg with increasing complexity in flow channels we compare the performance of the two models in predicting evolution of egg locations while drifting particularly we evaluate the models in how they respond to the channel complexity for predicting dispersion of carp eggs this paper is organized as follows section 2 reviews the key differences between the two models section 3 describes the three channels we used for simulations a straight open channel an idealized curved channel and an 8 km reach in the lower missouri river the results of egg dispersion and discussion are given in section 4 in section 5 we provide additional discussion on parameterization of dispersion coefficients in the three tested channels according to the model evaluation results section 6 summarizes the conclusions 2 models 2 1 egg tracking models two 3 d lagrangian particle tracking models are used in this study fluegg garcia et al 2013 2015 and sdrift li et al 2022 both models consider the evolution of egg characteristics due to water hardening george et al 2017 i e egg diameter and density are a function of post fertilization time and are affected by water temperature the details of equations used in these two models can be found in garcia et al 2013 2015 and li et al 2022 the main difference between the two models are 1 fluegg takes 1 d hydrodynamic data to drive the flow whereas sdrift takes 3 d hydrodynamic data 2 fluegg uses semi empirical equations to estimate dispersion coefficients i e the effect of turbulence on egg transport is implicitly implemented in tracking equations sdrift uses turbulent fluctuating velocities explicitly in tracking equations in which the turbulent velocities are determined using the solution for the governing stochastic differential equation the key differences in how turbulence is implemented in these two models are highlighted below 2 2 effect of turbulence the egg tracking equations for egg movement in longitudinal transverse and vertical directions in fluegg are garcia et al 2013 1 x t δ t x t u δ t r x 2 k h δ t 2 y t δ t y t v δ t r y 2 k h δ t 3 z t δ t z t w δ t v egg δ t k v δ t r z 2 k v offset δ t in these equations u v w are the three dimensional components of the mean flow velocity r terms represent the effect of turbulence and r x r y r z are independent random numbers sampled from a normal distribution with mean of zero and variance of unity k h is horizontal dispersion coefficient and takes k h 0 6 h u with h being water depth and u being shear velocity k v is the vertical dispersion coefficient and is a function of eddy viscosity with a modification using shear velocity and egg settling velocity the value of k v is evaluated at an offset location z 0 5 k v δ t with k v being the gradient of k v garcia et al 2013 in the z direction v egg is the averaged egg settling velocity calculated at time steps t and t δ t the k v term represents the vertical movement of eggs from low to high diffusivity in the water column garcia et al 2013 law of the wall and the beta probability density function seo and baek 2004 are considered for vertical and transverse velocity distributions in fluegg which contribute to shear induced dispersion in addition to the dispersion induced by turbulence diffusion the egg tracking equations in sdrift are li et al 2022 4 x t δ t x t u δ t u δ t 5 y t δ t y t v δ t v δ t 6 z t δ t z t w δ t v egg δ t w δ t where u v w are turbulent velocities in three directions which are determined by the solution of langevin equation bocksell and loth 2001 wang et al 2020 li et al 2022 7 u i t δ t u i t exp δ t τ i σ i 1 exp 2 δ t τ i 1 2 ξ i where subscript i 1 2 3 represents three directions x y z σ and τ are characteristic velocity scale and lagrangian time scale of turbulent eddies both values can be estimated using the turbulence kinetic energy and dissipation rate which are typical output parameters of 3 d hydrodynamic models ξ i gives three independent random numbers sampled from a normal distribution with mean of zero and variance of unity same purpose as r terms in fluegg because sdrift uses 3 d hydrodynamic data as input files the model does not need semi empirical dispersion coefficients or velocity profiles 3 simulation channels 3 1 straight open channel we follow garcia et al 2013 and test model performance in a straight open channel using experimental data of tang et al 1989 the experiment was conducted in a 30 m long 0 72 m wide flume with a water depth of 0 6 m water temperature was 20 c carp eggs were released in the upstream and collected in the downstream with a 20 m drifting distance the egg collection took 5 min and obtained the vertical egg distribution every 0 1 m at the sampling location the drift experiment was carried out in four flow conditions with mean velocity u 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 m s mean flow velocity was measured at 1 5 m upstream from the egg sampling location using u 0 1 u 0 0 h 3 u 0 2 h 3 u 0 6 h 2 u 0 8 h u 1 0 h with the subscripts indicating the measurement location relative to the water depth h two out of four cases u 0 4 and 0 2 m s are simulated here the mean longitudinal velocity profile is reconstructed using the classic law of the wall equation over a smooth boundary that yields the experimentally measured mean velocity garcia et al 2013 fig 1a consequently the shear velocity is u 0 0158 and 0 0084 m s for u 0 4 and 0 2 m s respectively the mean transverse and vertical velocities are assumed to be zero fluegg takes u as the input parameter to calculate the horizontal dispersion coefficient and the vertical turbulent diffusion coefficient sdrift requires additional inputs for turbulence quantities we apply the semi theoretical relation for turbulent fluctuating components nezu and nakagawa 1993 8 u u d u exp c k z h 9 v u d v exp c k z h 10 w u d w exp c k z h where u v and w are the root mean square of velocities in x y and z directions known as turbulence intensities coefficients are given as c k 1 0 d u 2 30 d v 1 27 and d w 1 63 nezu and nakagawa 1993 the differences among d u d v and d w represent the anisotropy of turbulent fluctuations in different directions the vertical profiles of turbulence intensities are plotted in fig 1b the reconstructed data show that the turbulent fluctuations are typically in a few centimeter per second ranges turbulence kinetic energy tke is defined as k 0 5 u 2 v 2 w 2 the dissipation rate ɛ of tke takes the classic format of law of the wall relation ɛ u 3 κ z where κ 0 41 is the von kármán constant their profiles are given in fig 1c and 1d for two tested flow conditions the profile of effective eddy viscosity is calculated using ν t c μ k 2 ɛ with c μ 0 09 in comparison with the parabolic relation one of three relations in fluegg ν t κ u z 1 z h the parabolic relation gives relatively larger eddy viscosity in the water column but on the same order of magnitude fig 1e the profile of eddy viscosity estimated from k and ɛ is asymmetric with the peak in the lower water column whereas the parabolic equation shows a symmetric mid water peaking profile in the two tested flow conditions the overall lagrangian time scale of turbulent eddies in the water column except for close to the bottom was τ 2 4 s and 4 8 s for u 0 4 and 0 2 m s respectively fig 1f this time scale τ defines the characteristic duration for a particle to have strong auto correlations of particle velocities the egg drift models were set up in the same way as reported in garcia et al 2013 20 000 eggs were used in this study for both fluegg and sdrift models which provided a converged result in predicting overall transport of eggs 80 000 eggs were used in garcia et al 2013 following garcia et al 2013 we used static egg characteristics ρ egg 999 78 kg m 3 d egg 4 2 mm which give a constant settling velocity of v egg 7 7 mm s eggs were released on the water surface in the center of the channel at x 0 m to test the performance of the models in a long straight channel we extended the channel length so that eggs can drift over 2000 s the actual drift time in the experiment was about 5 min tang et al 1989 3 2 idealized curved channel we constructed a simple idealized curved channel similar to the meandering channel used in mcdonald and nelson 2021 the channel has a parabolic cross section profile with 600 and 10 m in x and y directions owning to its sinusoidal shape the stream wise length was 828 m the sinuosity was 1 38 and the channel slope was 0 001 a discharge value of 2 5 m 3 s was used to set up the flow conditions flow 3d hydro was used to model the 3 d hydrodynamics the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans model was used to solve steady state flow parameters with the re normalization group rng modified k ɛ turbulence closure model li et al 2022 the bottom roughness was adjusted so that the water surface profile has the same slope of the channel bed the spatial resolution for the cfd model was 0 25 0 25 0 035 m 3 in the x y z coordinate system model results show that the maximal water depth was approximately 0 65 m fig 2 mean water depth was 0 45 m and mean flow velocity was 0 22 m s this gives the reynolds number r e u h ν 99000 the modeling result of 3 d hydrodynamics was converted into 1 d hydrodynamic data in the stream wise longitudinal and span wise transverse coordinate system which was used for the fluegg simulation 20 000 eggs ρ egg 999 78 kg m 3 d egg 4 2 mm were released on the water surface at x 0 m in the center of the channel the location of each egg was saved with a time step of 1 s egg tracking was completed after eggs moved out of the channel at x 600 m 3 3 representative reach in the missouri river the representative river reach is an 8 km curved channel sinuosity 1 12 in the lower missouri river near lexington missouri fig 3 this reach is highly engineered for the purpose of navigation river training and bank stabilization galat and lipkin 2000 jacobson and galat 2006 the annual discharge is approximately 1700 m 3 s streamflow gaging station 06895500 at waverly missouri u s geological survey 2022 the hydrology and hydraulics information at this reach has been extensively studied jacobson et al 2016 bed materials are mostly medium to coarse sands with fine muddy materials close to the dike fields and near the banks gaeuman and jacobson 2006 poulton and allert 2012 this reach has been used for testing sdrift in our model development stage detailed parameters about this reach can be found in li et al 2022 data for the bathymetric topographic digital elevation model dem water surface elevations and velocity data can be found in elliott et al 2022 3 d hydrodynamics were modeled using flow3d hydro using rans model with an rng modified k ɛ sub model after mesh sensitivity analysis li et al 2022 the final mesh was 4 4 0 4 m 3 in the x y z coordinate system the model was calibrated using the measured surface elevation profile and validated using measured velocities from an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp the velocities were measured in 22 cross sections at two river discharges close to the river mile 311 see fig 3 the procedure of model calibration and validation can be found in li et al 2022 the validation results at the discharge of 3062 m 3 s show that the root mean square error is 0 034 and 0 029 m s or equivalently 2 5 and 2 1 of the mean flow for the streamwise and spanwise velocity respectively li et al 2022 four flow conditions discharge q 1342 2282 3060 and 4219 m 3 s were simulated for egg tracking these discharges correspond to 45 to 3 daily flow exceedance in the reach two different egg release conditions were simulated first 6600 eggs were released at the water surface uniformly distributed in an upstream cross section of the channel this release condition allowed us to evaluate the influence of various spawning locations on egg transport the x coordinate of the release cross section is marked as x 0 m second 1000 eggs were released at the water surface in the channel center this release condition allowed us to evaluate the transport of eggs from a point source spawning event in both simulations location of each egg is recorded with a time step of 1 s until the egg reaches the downstream boundary we subsequently converted the 3 d hydrodynamics to 1 d data so that fluegg could be used to simulate the same flow conditions 4 results and discussion 4 1 straight open channel the mean egg location as a function of drift time is shown in fig 4 during the first 100 s both models have similar mean egg location in the streamwise direction mean spanwise location is the center of the flume and the temporal variations are small in both models the largest difference between the two models is the mean location in the vertical direction the overall vertical transport of the eggs in fluegg is faster than that using sdrift after approximately 90 s mean vertical egg location converges onto almost the same water depth z 0 48 and 0 55 m for u 0 4 and 0 2 m s respectively examining individual egg locations indicates fluegg has a faster vertical diffusion in this straight channel than sdrift which contributes to faster decrease of mean vertical location of eggs the faster vertical diffusion also contributes to faster spreading of eggs in the longitudinal direction the probability density of egg distributions in the longitudinal direction within 30 m downstream distance shows the dispersion of eggs in the flume fig 5 we selected t 25 s and 60 s for u 0 4 m s which gave mean egg location at 10 m and 24 m respectively fig 5a t 50 s and 120 s were selected for u 0 2 m s giving the same mean egg location in the longitudinal direction in fig 5 we also plotted the analytical solution for the longitudinal tracer distribution from a point source release fischer et al 1979 rehmann 2015 11 c t m a 4 π k x t exp x u t 2 4 k x t where the mass m and cross sectional area a take the value of 1 in one dimension here so that c has a dimension of 1 l k x is the effective diffusion coefficient in the longitudinal direction solutions with two different k x values are plotted k x 0 15 h u and k x 5 93 h u k x 0 15 h u represents an approximate average of transverse mixing from a variety of experiments in straight flumes k x 5 93 h u represents the shear dispersion due to the logarithmic velocity profile in the channel elder 1959 fischer et al 1979 the comparison between two models and the theoretical solution of tracer concentrations using empirical dispersion coefficient equations demonstrates different model behaviors in general sdrift yields slower rates of longitudinal egg spreading in the channel than fluegg at 10 m average distance sdrift tracks the k x 0 15 h u solution closely indicating weak shear induced dispersion the spreading of eggs is mainly attributed to turbulent diffusion with the turbulent fluctuating velocities on the order of o cm s see fig 1 at 24 m average distance the egg distribution is in between the two analytical solutions indicating that the influence of shear induced dispersion is captured by sdrift when eggs are adequately diffused by the turbulence this effect is more obvious for u 0 2 m s i e more spreading at t 120 s in contrast fluegg tracks the k x 5 93 h u solution almost immediately after the egg release this is because egg movements in the fluegg model are immediately calculated following the equations of shear dispersion whereas sdrift allows different mechanisms of egg movement e g turbulent diffusion shear dispersion etc to evolve subsequently with respect to time li et al 2022 the egg distributions cover a wider longitudinal range when the mean egg drift reaches a few hundreds meters fig 6 sdrift and fluegg predict similar egg distributions under these conditions and both are close to elder s solution k x 5 93 h u elder 1959 sdrift has slightly narrower distributions and larger peaks indicating a slightly weaker dispersion than fluegg predicts we note that most eggs are close to the bottom thus the tracer which is completely dispersed through the water column transported faster than eggs fluegg also predicts slightly faster egg transport than sdrift at u 0 2 m s the probability density of egg locations in the water column at x 20 m is plotted in fig 7 in comparison with the experimental egg sampling data in tang et al 1989 here we plotted fluegg results using two different vertical eddy viscosity models parabolic and parabolic constant garcia et al 2013 noticeable discrepancies are observed between two models for u 0 4 m s sdrift shows larger probabilities in mid water 0 2 0 5 m and smaller probabilities in the upper and lower water column than fluegg this is because of weaker turbulent mixing in sdrift than fluegg at the early stage of a point source release for u 0 2 m s sdrift and fluegg predict similar probability density of eggs in the bottom 0 3 m but sdrift predicts less eggs in the surface than fluegg this is also the result of weaker vertical mixing in sdrift under the smooth boundary layer turbulence we suspect that the turbulence condition in the experiment may be stronger than the constructed smooth boundary layer flow and hence gives more uniform distribution of eggs in the water column than the model predictions with stronger turbulence in the channel our simulation would reach shear induced dispersion earlier and hence would give a closer prediction to the experimental results even with stronger mixing immediately implemented in fluegg the vertical egg distribution shows an overestimation in the lower water column 4 2 idealized curved channel the spatial distribution of depth averaged velocities in the curved channel depends on relative location to the channel curvature and depicts strong secondary flow characteristics fig 8 obvious vertical mean flows occur at the channel bends showing downwelling and upwelling regions at the outer and inner bend respectively mean longitudinal and transverse velocities are calculated after conversion from x y to longitudinal transverse coordinate system fig 9 longitudinal velocities vary in the range of 0 21 to 0 23 m s and transverse velocities vary in the range of 0 05 to 0 05 m s in the channel the probability plot of longitudinal egg distributions shows the process of mean and differential advection of eggs at three different times in the curved channel t 1000 2000 and 3000 s fig 10 different from the straight channel sdrift predicts slightly stronger dispersion than fluegg especially at t 1000 s the analytical solution of tracer concentration with a referencing longitudinal dispersion coefficient k l 80 h u is in general agreement with the overall spreading of the eggs fischer 1968 pointed out that elder s solution is likely only valid in small laboratory channels natural streams should have k l ranging from 40 h u to 800 h u with an average of 200 h u the approximate value of k l 80 h u is close to our simulation and is well within the range reported in natural streams adding to the effect of river and flow conditions the varying coefficient in the scaling relation is highly related to the mixing stage e g sun et al 2013 for instance the transverse velocity gradient is the main contributor to longitudinal dispersion when the particles are well mixed in the vertical direction fischer et al 1979 schwab and rehmann 2015 the contribution of the vertical velocity gradient depends on the ratio of mixing time in the vertical and transverse directions schwab and rehmann 2015 to include this information in a wide range of hydraulic parameters would require more sophisticated scaling models to parameterize the dispersion coefficient such as using the channel width to depth ratio the ratio between depth averaged velocity and shear velocity or others e g deng et al 2001 carr and rehmann 2007 4 3 representative reach in the missouri river calibration results for the hydrodynamic modeling for four discharges are shown in fig 11 the root mean square error rmse of water surface elevation is 0 07 0 03 0 04 and 0 03 m for q 1 to q 4 respectively in li et al 2022 we have validated modeling results of velocities with adcp data at 10 cross sections for q 3 3060 m 3 s we showed that the rmse in the simulated longitudinal and transverse velocities is 0 034 and 0 029 m s or equivalently 2 5 and 2 1 of mean flow velocity li et al 2022 similarly adcp data at 12 cross sections for q 2 2282 m 3 s were also used to validate the cfd simulation results a representative example of adcp versus cfd comparison of 3 d velocity components fig 12 demonstrates that the cfd simulations capture both longitudinal flow and the secondary transverse velocities the vertical component is more challenging to simulate note that adcp data are an average of only four transects averaging of only four transects is inadequate to smooth spatial and temporal variation to obtain the exact mean flow in real channels a series of validation plots using the method in alvarez et al 2017 demonstrates the difference error between the measured data and the simulation results fig 13 the comparison shows that the simulated and measured velocities track the same probability density curve fig 13a with 75 of errors within 0 2 m s fig 13b fig 13c shows the dot product of measured velocity vector and simulated velocity vector the value of 1 indicates the perfect match of velocity direction these plots indicate the overall good agreement between cfd and the measured data for both velocity magnitude and direction sdrift results reveal rich spatial variations of egg transport for instance 3 d flow structures depending on the location and discharge have a strong effect on the dispersion of eggs fig 14 at q 1 1342 m 3 s a substantial amount of eggs are temporarily trapped by strong turbulent eddies at one of three locations immediately after the egg release downstream from a wing dike fig 14a showing strong spatial variations within a relatively short distance 20 m apart as a result of localized turbulence the influences of strong large scale eddies are present at the location of l head dikes fig 14b the trajectories of eggs are highly influenced by the discharge at q 4 4219 m 3 s the effect of two dimensional eddies caused by the hydraulic structure is relatively small therefore the influence of hydraulic structures on egg transport must be evaluated on specific discharges egg distribution in the longitudinal direction is shown in fig 15 at t 0 5 and 1 h predicted using sdrift and fluegg the longitudinal probability density curves of eggs predicted by fluegg are generally narrower and located further downstream compared to the curves predicted by sdrift this result indicates that in natural complex channels fluegg predicts faster but weaker longitudinal dispersion than sdrift calculating the spreading of eggs we found that the longitudinal dispersion coefficients k l within 30 h u to 80 h u are in a general agreement of fluegg data whereas sdrift results yield a range of 200 h u to 250 h u in addition we note that the strong long tail distribution of sdrift is attributed to retention of eggs in the low velocity channel margins and large recirculation eddies associated with bank irregularities and hydraulic structures e g wing dikes and l head dikes in the river li et al 2022 fluegg is driven by one dimensional hydraulics and hence is not able to resolve the effect of hydraulic structures on egg transport beyond the longitudinal direction the slowing and retention of eggs may have implications for survival and recruitment to the population although at present these implications are not well understood the differential survival of carp eggs depending on hydraulic fate remains an important research topic 5 additional discussion on dispersion coefficient 5 1 parameterization of dispersion coefficient the simulations of egg drift in three increasingly complex channels illustrate the relative importance of capturing these complexities of flow in the resulting spatial and temporal distributions of simulated egg dispersal although a simple analytical solution for a tracer release cannot be used to represent egg transport completely in these channels the comparison between the model results and the analytical solution with different longitudinal dispersion coefficients k l provides useful insights about the model performance in the straight open channel k l k x 5 93 h u agrees quite well with fluegg immediately from the egg release point sdrift results track k l 0 15 h u better in the initial stage and gradually approach k l 5 93 h u in the idealized curved channel both fluegg and sdrift generally agree with k l 80 h u in the representative reach of the lower missouri river longitudinal dispersion of eggs using fluegg agrees with the analytical estimate of transport using k l 30 80 h u whereas the sdrift predicted dispersion coefficients are in agreement with the analytical estimate using k l 200 250 h u from the above comparison we found that both models can accommodate channel morphology which results in two orders of magnitudes for the scaling factors in dispersion coefficient using k l h u both models show an increasing factor with increasing complexity of channel morphology despite the fact that fluegg uses a small constant scaling factor in the horizontal dispersion coefficient k h 0 6 h u the outcome of varying scaling factor in the fluegg simulation results is attributed to the combined effect in the tracking algorithm in both horizontal and vertical direction for instance the law of the wall profile of velocity used in fluegg increases longitudinal dispersion i e faster slower longitudinal movement closer to the water surface channel bottom hence the effective dispersion coefficient is always larger than k h 0 6 h u as indicated from our test results overall fluegg performs reasonably well in a broad range of river and stream parameters in contrast sdrift uses 3 d hydrodynamic data and therefore the effect of velocity gradient is implicitly implemented in addition sdrift directly uses turbulent velocities in the tracking algorithm which can simulate transport processes over a wide range of turbulence conditions for instance sdrift is able to capture weak turbulent mixing in the initial stage and to mimic the natural growth of turbulent diffusion coefficient e g the straight channel simulation see also section 5 2 due to the fundamental difference in the dimensions of input flow characteristics sdrift can reveal much more information relevant to localized velocity gradients meter scale turbulent eddies and influences of hydraulic structures li et al 2022 these complex river characteristics substantially enhance mixing and transport and likely result in large dispersion coefficients that fluegg may underestimate heer et al 2020 2021 5 2 growth of dispersion coefficient the point source release case i e eggs are released in the center of the river allows us to examine the analogy of the richardson law of turbulent diffusion for river dispersion process the richardson law states that the diffusion coefficient grows proportionally to the cloud size to the power of 4 3 richardson and walker 1926 fischer et al 1979 this is because the particles within the cloud typically cannot be separated by the turbulent eddies that are larger than the cloud size i e they can only be advected but not diffused when the cloud size gets larger the spreading rate become larger in river dispersion we expect to see a similar particle spreading process this is particularly true in the early stage of the point source dispersion as we showed in the straight open channel simulation an example of egg particle distributions shows the spreading of egg particles in the river fig 16 we calculated the mean trajectory of egg drift by averaging all particle trajectories and then determined the projected location on the mean trajectory and the distance of each egg to the mean trajectory i e longitudinal and transverse coordinate x l and x t thus the standard deviation of x l and x t denoted as σ l and σ t can be used to represent the cloud size of egg spreading in the longitudinal and transverse direction respectively the cloud size can be used to estimate longitudinal dispersion coefficients k l fischer 1968 12 k l 1 2 d σ l 2 d t the instantaneous longitudinal dispersion coefficients are plotted as a function of time fig 17a the data are quite scattered and the four tested discharges have relatively weak effects on the dispersion coefficients as expected in the point source release k l increases from 0 to about 15 m 2 s within about 500 1000 s after which k l is strongly affected by the river morphology around 3600 s k l in different discharges vary between 20 60 m 2 s these instantaneous values lie in the range of 30 h u to 200 h u for the simulated discharges note that these values are smaller than the case when eggs are released across the entire river width k l 200 h u in the broadly distributed releases the cross section velocity gradient has much stronger effects than that in the point source release in addition a substantial portion of eggs is entrapped and slowed down by vortices in the dike regions when eggs are broadly released the egg cloud spreading data in the early stage shows an analogy of the richardson s 4 3 law fig 17b the later stage of dispersion is strongly affected by the river morphology and hence is not plotted note that k h is the horizontal dispersion coefficient calculated using eq 12 by replacing σ l with σ h σ l 2 σ t 2 the data show a well observed power law relation between k h and the egg cloud size defined as l h 3 σ h the best fit line indicates k h l h 1 1 for the simulated eggs the fitted exponent 1 1 in the power law is slightly smaller than 4 3 this could be partially attributed to the inertia of eggs so that the egg cloud spreads out in a slower rate than tracer particles 6 conclusions in this paper we evaluated a newly developed stochastic egg drift model sdrift in predicting egg transport with gradually increased channel complexity with the comparison to a well known egg tracking model fluegg we evaluated the model performance in a uniformly straight open channel an idealized curved channel and an 8 km reach with in stream hydraulic structures and bed variations in the lower missouri river we demonstrated that both models can address the complexity of the channels and hence provide reasonable predictions of dispersion of eggs although the increased dimensionality of sdrift potentially provides for greater realism in more complex channels in the straight open channel with smooth wall turbulence sdrift yields weaker egg dispersion than that predicted using fluegg the weak dispersion is in part because the initial egg placement is on the surface and therefore eggs experience little vertical shear and minimal horizontal shear due to the smooth straight walled flume the initial stage of dispersion in sdrift agrees with the dispersion coefficient of k l 0 15 h u which is attributed primarily to turbulent diffusion sdrift predicts gradually increased dispersion coefficients that reach k l 5 93 h u where the vertical velocity profile plays the key role in longitudinal dispersion in the idealized curved channel with a sinuosity of 1 38 and reynolds number of 99000 both models predict egg transport with a longitudinal dispersion coefficient k l 80 h u a much higher value than those in the uniformly straight channel sdrift predicts a slightly higher dispersion in the real river with prominent channel training structures we first modeled hydrodynamics with calibrated 3 d cfd simulation code before conducing egg drift modeling due to strong interactions between eggs and turbulence induced by in stream hydraulic structures sdrift predicts strong longitudinal dispersion giving dispersion coefficients in the range of 200 250 h u comparable simulations using fluegg yield 30 80 h u moreover sdrift provides additional information in describing the role of in stream hydraulic structures and localized turbulence on the egg drift process including prediction of a long tail of slowly moving eggs in the upstream which may have implications for survival and recruitment to carp populations using sdrift also allows examining the growth of dispersion coefficients in point source releases we show an analogy of the richardson s power law for turbulent diffusion in the fluvial egg dispersion the simulated egg dispersion data show a power law relation between the horizontal dispersion coefficient and the egg cloud size k h l h 1 1 credit authorship contribution statement geng li

24307,to help better interpret computational models in predicting drift of carp eggs in rivers we present a series of model assessments for the longitudinal egg dispersion two three dimensional lagrangian particle tracking models sdrift and fluegg are evaluated in a series of channels with increasing complexity the model evaluation demonstrates that both models are able to accommodate channel complexity and provide a wide range of dispersion coefficients k l o 1 100 h u with h being water depth and u being shear velocity in a straight channel with k l o 1 h u sdrift predicts weaker longitudinal dispersion than fluegg in the early stage as a result of weak vertical mixing associated with smooth wall turbulence with sufficient time sdrift and fluegg predict similar egg dispersion accounting for the differential advection due to the vertical velocity profile in an idealized curved channel with k l o 10 h u dispersion is driven by both vertical and transverse velocity profiles sdrift yields slightly larger dispersion coefficients than fluegg in a real river with channel training structures and having k l o 100 h u sdrift predicts a stronger longitudinal dispersion than fluegg due to substantial local turbulent eddies and velocity gradients to summarize fluegg shows good performance in capturing dispersion due to vertical velocity profiles and cross channel velocity gradients sdrift shows excellent model capabilities of revealing various dispersion mechanisms in addition to the vertical and cross channel velocity variations they include the initial turbulent diffusion stage with growing dispersion coefficients and strong dispersion due to in stream hydraulic structures and localized turbulence data availability the data has been released in an online database 1 introduction grass carp ctenopharyngodon idella bighead carp hypophthalmichthys nobilis and silver carp h molitrix are native to asia where they support important fisheries but they are invasive in north america food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2020 chapman et al 2016 irons et al 2007 cudmore et al 2012 chick et al 2020 whether they are considered as an important food source or an invasive species understanding the process of carp spawning and recruitment in their natural habitats is an important topic to aquatic ecology fisheries economics and engineering for water resources management egg drift is a critical life cycle stage that is highly influenced by characteristics of river flows the carps are rheophilic spawning in turbulence zones of rivers yih and liang 1964 jennings 1988 prada et al 2020 the eggs are released into the water column and develop while drifting downstream settling to the bottom where they are likely to be covered by sediment is detrimental to egg survival george and chapman 2015 the initial diameter of carp eggs is about 1 to 2 mm with settling velocities of approximately 2 cm s george et al 2017 depending on temperature within approximately 3 to 5 h eggs absorb large amounts of water and become 5 to 7 mm in diameter george et al 2017 during this process known as water hardening their densities reach an equilibrium value close to water density as such the egg settling velocity is reduced by approximately 70 which allows them to be better suspended by turbulence while drifting downstream garcia et al 2016 on river scales lagrangian particle tracking lpt models have been useful and effective in predicting transport of carp eggs notably fluegg is a widely used three dimensional 3 d lpt model that incorporates one dimensional 1 d hydrodynamic data garcia et al 2013 2015 in recent years there have been increasing numbers of studies using 3 d hydrodynamic models to help better understand the effect of turbulence on egg transport heer et al 2020 2021 river turbulence plays an important role in nursing carp eggs it helps keep eggs suspended and controls transport distance which determines the timing and locations of hatching garcia et al 2015 heer et al 2020 2021 in addition turbulence also affects the swimming behavior of carp larvae prada et al 2020 2021 to further understand the role of turbulence on egg drift we developed a new lpt model using the solution of stochastic differential equations for simulating realistic turbulent velocities li et al 2022 this 3 d stochastic drift model sdrift is shown to be able to capture the correlated turbulent velocities over the lifetime of turbulent eddies the major advantage of using 3 d hydrodynamic data to drive an egg drift model is the ability to capture the effects of localized turbulence for instance the strong spatial variability and eddies induced by in stream structures and complex river bed morphology heer et al 2020 2021 li et al 2022 although 3 d hydrodynamics models have clear advantages in resolving spatial hydraulic information models with simpler parameterizations may be useful and more cost effective in a variety of fluvial systems from very simple channels to natural rivers here we present a series of assessments and comparisons between two lpt models sdrift and fluegg with increasing complexity in flow channels we compare the performance of the two models in predicting evolution of egg locations while drifting particularly we evaluate the models in how they respond to the channel complexity for predicting dispersion of carp eggs this paper is organized as follows section 2 reviews the key differences between the two models section 3 describes the three channels we used for simulations a straight open channel an idealized curved channel and an 8 km reach in the lower missouri river the results of egg dispersion and discussion are given in section 4 in section 5 we provide additional discussion on parameterization of dispersion coefficients in the three tested channels according to the model evaluation results section 6 summarizes the conclusions 2 models 2 1 egg tracking models two 3 d lagrangian particle tracking models are used in this study fluegg garcia et al 2013 2015 and sdrift li et al 2022 both models consider the evolution of egg characteristics due to water hardening george et al 2017 i e egg diameter and density are a function of post fertilization time and are affected by water temperature the details of equations used in these two models can be found in garcia et al 2013 2015 and li et al 2022 the main difference between the two models are 1 fluegg takes 1 d hydrodynamic data to drive the flow whereas sdrift takes 3 d hydrodynamic data 2 fluegg uses semi empirical equations to estimate dispersion coefficients i e the effect of turbulence on egg transport is implicitly implemented in tracking equations sdrift uses turbulent fluctuating velocities explicitly in tracking equations in which the turbulent velocities are determined using the solution for the governing stochastic differential equation the key differences in how turbulence is implemented in these two models are highlighted below 2 2 effect of turbulence the egg tracking equations for egg movement in longitudinal transverse and vertical directions in fluegg are garcia et al 2013 1 x t δ t x t u δ t r x 2 k h δ t 2 y t δ t y t v δ t r y 2 k h δ t 3 z t δ t z t w δ t v egg δ t k v δ t r z 2 k v offset δ t in these equations u v w are the three dimensional components of the mean flow velocity r terms represent the effect of turbulence and r x r y r z are independent random numbers sampled from a normal distribution with mean of zero and variance of unity k h is horizontal dispersion coefficient and takes k h 0 6 h u with h being water depth and u being shear velocity k v is the vertical dispersion coefficient and is a function of eddy viscosity with a modification using shear velocity and egg settling velocity the value of k v is evaluated at an offset location z 0 5 k v δ t with k v being the gradient of k v garcia et al 2013 in the z direction v egg is the averaged egg settling velocity calculated at time steps t and t δ t the k v term represents the vertical movement of eggs from low to high diffusivity in the water column garcia et al 2013 law of the wall and the beta probability density function seo and baek 2004 are considered for vertical and transverse velocity distributions in fluegg which contribute to shear induced dispersion in addition to the dispersion induced by turbulence diffusion the egg tracking equations in sdrift are li et al 2022 4 x t δ t x t u δ t u δ t 5 y t δ t y t v δ t v δ t 6 z t δ t z t w δ t v egg δ t w δ t where u v w are turbulent velocities in three directions which are determined by the solution of langevin equation bocksell and loth 2001 wang et al 2020 li et al 2022 7 u i t δ t u i t exp δ t τ i σ i 1 exp 2 δ t τ i 1 2 ξ i where subscript i 1 2 3 represents three directions x y z σ and τ are characteristic velocity scale and lagrangian time scale of turbulent eddies both values can be estimated using the turbulence kinetic energy and dissipation rate which are typical output parameters of 3 d hydrodynamic models ξ i gives three independent random numbers sampled from a normal distribution with mean of zero and variance of unity same purpose as r terms in fluegg because sdrift uses 3 d hydrodynamic data as input files the model does not need semi empirical dispersion coefficients or velocity profiles 3 simulation channels 3 1 straight open channel we follow garcia et al 2013 and test model performance in a straight open channel using experimental data of tang et al 1989 the experiment was conducted in a 30 m long 0 72 m wide flume with a water depth of 0 6 m water temperature was 20 c carp eggs were released in the upstream and collected in the downstream with a 20 m drifting distance the egg collection took 5 min and obtained the vertical egg distribution every 0 1 m at the sampling location the drift experiment was carried out in four flow conditions with mean velocity u 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 m s mean flow velocity was measured at 1 5 m upstream from the egg sampling location using u 0 1 u 0 0 h 3 u 0 2 h 3 u 0 6 h 2 u 0 8 h u 1 0 h with the subscripts indicating the measurement location relative to the water depth h two out of four cases u 0 4 and 0 2 m s are simulated here the mean longitudinal velocity profile is reconstructed using the classic law of the wall equation over a smooth boundary that yields the experimentally measured mean velocity garcia et al 2013 fig 1a consequently the shear velocity is u 0 0158 and 0 0084 m s for u 0 4 and 0 2 m s respectively the mean transverse and vertical velocities are assumed to be zero fluegg takes u as the input parameter to calculate the horizontal dispersion coefficient and the vertical turbulent diffusion coefficient sdrift requires additional inputs for turbulence quantities we apply the semi theoretical relation for turbulent fluctuating components nezu and nakagawa 1993 8 u u d u exp c k z h 9 v u d v exp c k z h 10 w u d w exp c k z h where u v and w are the root mean square of velocities in x y and z directions known as turbulence intensities coefficients are given as c k 1 0 d u 2 30 d v 1 27 and d w 1 63 nezu and nakagawa 1993 the differences among d u d v and d w represent the anisotropy of turbulent fluctuations in different directions the vertical profiles of turbulence intensities are plotted in fig 1b the reconstructed data show that the turbulent fluctuations are typically in a few centimeter per second ranges turbulence kinetic energy tke is defined as k 0 5 u 2 v 2 w 2 the dissipation rate ɛ of tke takes the classic format of law of the wall relation ɛ u 3 κ z where κ 0 41 is the von kármán constant their profiles are given in fig 1c and 1d for two tested flow conditions the profile of effective eddy viscosity is calculated using ν t c μ k 2 ɛ with c μ 0 09 in comparison with the parabolic relation one of three relations in fluegg ν t κ u z 1 z h the parabolic relation gives relatively larger eddy viscosity in the water column but on the same order of magnitude fig 1e the profile of eddy viscosity estimated from k and ɛ is asymmetric with the peak in the lower water column whereas the parabolic equation shows a symmetric mid water peaking profile in the two tested flow conditions the overall lagrangian time scale of turbulent eddies in the water column except for close to the bottom was τ 2 4 s and 4 8 s for u 0 4 and 0 2 m s respectively fig 1f this time scale τ defines the characteristic duration for a particle to have strong auto correlations of particle velocities the egg drift models were set up in the same way as reported in garcia et al 2013 20 000 eggs were used in this study for both fluegg and sdrift models which provided a converged result in predicting overall transport of eggs 80 000 eggs were used in garcia et al 2013 following garcia et al 2013 we used static egg characteristics ρ egg 999 78 kg m 3 d egg 4 2 mm which give a constant settling velocity of v egg 7 7 mm s eggs were released on the water surface in the center of the channel at x 0 m to test the performance of the models in a long straight channel we extended the channel length so that eggs can drift over 2000 s the actual drift time in the experiment was about 5 min tang et al 1989 3 2 idealized curved channel we constructed a simple idealized curved channel similar to the meandering channel used in mcdonald and nelson 2021 the channel has a parabolic cross section profile with 600 and 10 m in x and y directions owning to its sinusoidal shape the stream wise length was 828 m the sinuosity was 1 38 and the channel slope was 0 001 a discharge value of 2 5 m 3 s was used to set up the flow conditions flow 3d hydro was used to model the 3 d hydrodynamics the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans model was used to solve steady state flow parameters with the re normalization group rng modified k ɛ turbulence closure model li et al 2022 the bottom roughness was adjusted so that the water surface profile has the same slope of the channel bed the spatial resolution for the cfd model was 0 25 0 25 0 035 m 3 in the x y z coordinate system model results show that the maximal water depth was approximately 0 65 m fig 2 mean water depth was 0 45 m and mean flow velocity was 0 22 m s this gives the reynolds number r e u h ν 99000 the modeling result of 3 d hydrodynamics was converted into 1 d hydrodynamic data in the stream wise longitudinal and span wise transverse coordinate system which was used for the fluegg simulation 20 000 eggs ρ egg 999 78 kg m 3 d egg 4 2 mm were released on the water surface at x 0 m in the center of the channel the location of each egg was saved with a time step of 1 s egg tracking was completed after eggs moved out of the channel at x 600 m 3 3 representative reach in the missouri river the representative river reach is an 8 km curved channel sinuosity 1 12 in the lower missouri river near lexington missouri fig 3 this reach is highly engineered for the purpose of navigation river training and bank stabilization galat and lipkin 2000 jacobson and galat 2006 the annual discharge is approximately 1700 m 3 s streamflow gaging station 06895500 at waverly missouri u s geological survey 2022 the hydrology and hydraulics information at this reach has been extensively studied jacobson et al 2016 bed materials are mostly medium to coarse sands with fine muddy materials close to the dike fields and near the banks gaeuman and jacobson 2006 poulton and allert 2012 this reach has been used for testing sdrift in our model development stage detailed parameters about this reach can be found in li et al 2022 data for the bathymetric topographic digital elevation model dem water surface elevations and velocity data can be found in elliott et al 2022 3 d hydrodynamics were modeled using flow3d hydro using rans model with an rng modified k ɛ sub model after mesh sensitivity analysis li et al 2022 the final mesh was 4 4 0 4 m 3 in the x y z coordinate system the model was calibrated using the measured surface elevation profile and validated using measured velocities from an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp the velocities were measured in 22 cross sections at two river discharges close to the river mile 311 see fig 3 the procedure of model calibration and validation can be found in li et al 2022 the validation results at the discharge of 3062 m 3 s show that the root mean square error is 0 034 and 0 029 m s or equivalently 2 5 and 2 1 of the mean flow for the streamwise and spanwise velocity respectively li et al 2022 four flow conditions discharge q 1342 2282 3060 and 4219 m 3 s were simulated for egg tracking these discharges correspond to 45 to 3 daily flow exceedance in the reach two different egg release conditions were simulated first 6600 eggs were released at the water surface uniformly distributed in an upstream cross section of the channel this release condition allowed us to evaluate the influence of various spawning locations on egg transport the x coordinate of the release cross section is marked as x 0 m second 1000 eggs were released at the water surface in the channel center this release condition allowed us to evaluate the transport of eggs from a point source spawning event in both simulations location of each egg is recorded with a time step of 1 s until the egg reaches the downstream boundary we subsequently converted the 3 d hydrodynamics to 1 d data so that fluegg could be used to simulate the same flow conditions 4 results and discussion 4 1 straight open channel the mean egg location as a function of drift time is shown in fig 4 during the first 100 s both models have similar mean egg location in the streamwise direction mean spanwise location is the center of the flume and the temporal variations are small in both models the largest difference between the two models is the mean location in the vertical direction the overall vertical transport of the eggs in fluegg is faster than that using sdrift after approximately 90 s mean vertical egg location converges onto almost the same water depth z 0 48 and 0 55 m for u 0 4 and 0 2 m s respectively examining individual egg locations indicates fluegg has a faster vertical diffusion in this straight channel than sdrift which contributes to faster decrease of mean vertical location of eggs the faster vertical diffusion also contributes to faster spreading of eggs in the longitudinal direction the probability density of egg distributions in the longitudinal direction within 30 m downstream distance shows the dispersion of eggs in the flume fig 5 we selected t 25 s and 60 s for u 0 4 m s which gave mean egg location at 10 m and 24 m respectively fig 5a t 50 s and 120 s were selected for u 0 2 m s giving the same mean egg location in the longitudinal direction in fig 5 we also plotted the analytical solution for the longitudinal tracer distribution from a point source release fischer et al 1979 rehmann 2015 11 c t m a 4 π k x t exp x u t 2 4 k x t where the mass m and cross sectional area a take the value of 1 in one dimension here so that c has a dimension of 1 l k x is the effective diffusion coefficient in the longitudinal direction solutions with two different k x values are plotted k x 0 15 h u and k x 5 93 h u k x 0 15 h u represents an approximate average of transverse mixing from a variety of experiments in straight flumes k x 5 93 h u represents the shear dispersion due to the logarithmic velocity profile in the channel elder 1959 fischer et al 1979 the comparison between two models and the theoretical solution of tracer concentrations using empirical dispersion coefficient equations demonstrates different model behaviors in general sdrift yields slower rates of longitudinal egg spreading in the channel than fluegg at 10 m average distance sdrift tracks the k x 0 15 h u solution closely indicating weak shear induced dispersion the spreading of eggs is mainly attributed to turbulent diffusion with the turbulent fluctuating velocities on the order of o cm s see fig 1 at 24 m average distance the egg distribution is in between the two analytical solutions indicating that the influence of shear induced dispersion is captured by sdrift when eggs are adequately diffused by the turbulence this effect is more obvious for u 0 2 m s i e more spreading at t 120 s in contrast fluegg tracks the k x 5 93 h u solution almost immediately after the egg release this is because egg movements in the fluegg model are immediately calculated following the equations of shear dispersion whereas sdrift allows different mechanisms of egg movement e g turbulent diffusion shear dispersion etc to evolve subsequently with respect to time li et al 2022 the egg distributions cover a wider longitudinal range when the mean egg drift reaches a few hundreds meters fig 6 sdrift and fluegg predict similar egg distributions under these conditions and both are close to elder s solution k x 5 93 h u elder 1959 sdrift has slightly narrower distributions and larger peaks indicating a slightly weaker dispersion than fluegg predicts we note that most eggs are close to the bottom thus the tracer which is completely dispersed through the water column transported faster than eggs fluegg also predicts slightly faster egg transport than sdrift at u 0 2 m s the probability density of egg locations in the water column at x 20 m is plotted in fig 7 in comparison with the experimental egg sampling data in tang et al 1989 here we plotted fluegg results using two different vertical eddy viscosity models parabolic and parabolic constant garcia et al 2013 noticeable discrepancies are observed between two models for u 0 4 m s sdrift shows larger probabilities in mid water 0 2 0 5 m and smaller probabilities in the upper and lower water column than fluegg this is because of weaker turbulent mixing in sdrift than fluegg at the early stage of a point source release for u 0 2 m s sdrift and fluegg predict similar probability density of eggs in the bottom 0 3 m but sdrift predicts less eggs in the surface than fluegg this is also the result of weaker vertical mixing in sdrift under the smooth boundary layer turbulence we suspect that the turbulence condition in the experiment may be stronger than the constructed smooth boundary layer flow and hence gives more uniform distribution of eggs in the water column than the model predictions with stronger turbulence in the channel our simulation would reach shear induced dispersion earlier and hence would give a closer prediction to the experimental results even with stronger mixing immediately implemented in fluegg the vertical egg distribution shows an overestimation in the lower water column 4 2 idealized curved channel the spatial distribution of depth averaged velocities in the curved channel depends on relative location to the channel curvature and depicts strong secondary flow characteristics fig 8 obvious vertical mean flows occur at the channel bends showing downwelling and upwelling regions at the outer and inner bend respectively mean longitudinal and transverse velocities are calculated after conversion from x y to longitudinal transverse coordinate system fig 9 longitudinal velocities vary in the range of 0 21 to 0 23 m s and transverse velocities vary in the range of 0 05 to 0 05 m s in the channel the probability plot of longitudinal egg distributions shows the process of mean and differential advection of eggs at three different times in the curved channel t 1000 2000 and 3000 s fig 10 different from the straight channel sdrift predicts slightly stronger dispersion than fluegg especially at t 1000 s the analytical solution of tracer concentration with a referencing longitudinal dispersion coefficient k l 80 h u is in general agreement with the overall spreading of the eggs fischer 1968 pointed out that elder s solution is likely only valid in small laboratory channels natural streams should have k l ranging from 40 h u to 800 h u with an average of 200 h u the approximate value of k l 80 h u is close to our simulation and is well within the range reported in natural streams adding to the effect of river and flow conditions the varying coefficient in the scaling relation is highly related to the mixing stage e g sun et al 2013 for instance the transverse velocity gradient is the main contributor to longitudinal dispersion when the particles are well mixed in the vertical direction fischer et al 1979 schwab and rehmann 2015 the contribution of the vertical velocity gradient depends on the ratio of mixing time in the vertical and transverse directions schwab and rehmann 2015 to include this information in a wide range of hydraulic parameters would require more sophisticated scaling models to parameterize the dispersion coefficient such as using the channel width to depth ratio the ratio between depth averaged velocity and shear velocity or others e g deng et al 2001 carr and rehmann 2007 4 3 representative reach in the missouri river calibration results for the hydrodynamic modeling for four discharges are shown in fig 11 the root mean square error rmse of water surface elevation is 0 07 0 03 0 04 and 0 03 m for q 1 to q 4 respectively in li et al 2022 we have validated modeling results of velocities with adcp data at 10 cross sections for q 3 3060 m 3 s we showed that the rmse in the simulated longitudinal and transverse velocities is 0 034 and 0 029 m s or equivalently 2 5 and 2 1 of mean flow velocity li et al 2022 similarly adcp data at 12 cross sections for q 2 2282 m 3 s were also used to validate the cfd simulation results a representative example of adcp versus cfd comparison of 3 d velocity components fig 12 demonstrates that the cfd simulations capture both longitudinal flow and the secondary transverse velocities the vertical component is more challenging to simulate note that adcp data are an average of only four transects averaging of only four transects is inadequate to smooth spatial and temporal variation to obtain the exact mean flow in real channels a series of validation plots using the method in alvarez et al 2017 demonstrates the difference error between the measured data and the simulation results fig 13 the comparison shows that the simulated and measured velocities track the same probability density curve fig 13a with 75 of errors within 0 2 m s fig 13b fig 13c shows the dot product of measured velocity vector and simulated velocity vector the value of 1 indicates the perfect match of velocity direction these plots indicate the overall good agreement between cfd and the measured data for both velocity magnitude and direction sdrift results reveal rich spatial variations of egg transport for instance 3 d flow structures depending on the location and discharge have a strong effect on the dispersion of eggs fig 14 at q 1 1342 m 3 s a substantial amount of eggs are temporarily trapped by strong turbulent eddies at one of three locations immediately after the egg release downstream from a wing dike fig 14a showing strong spatial variations within a relatively short distance 20 m apart as a result of localized turbulence the influences of strong large scale eddies are present at the location of l head dikes fig 14b the trajectories of eggs are highly influenced by the discharge at q 4 4219 m 3 s the effect of two dimensional eddies caused by the hydraulic structure is relatively small therefore the influence of hydraulic structures on egg transport must be evaluated on specific discharges egg distribution in the longitudinal direction is shown in fig 15 at t 0 5 and 1 h predicted using sdrift and fluegg the longitudinal probability density curves of eggs predicted by fluegg are generally narrower and located further downstream compared to the curves predicted by sdrift this result indicates that in natural complex channels fluegg predicts faster but weaker longitudinal dispersion than sdrift calculating the spreading of eggs we found that the longitudinal dispersion coefficients k l within 30 h u to 80 h u are in a general agreement of fluegg data whereas sdrift results yield a range of 200 h u to 250 h u in addition we note that the strong long tail distribution of sdrift is attributed to retention of eggs in the low velocity channel margins and large recirculation eddies associated with bank irregularities and hydraulic structures e g wing dikes and l head dikes in the river li et al 2022 fluegg is driven by one dimensional hydraulics and hence is not able to resolve the effect of hydraulic structures on egg transport beyond the longitudinal direction the slowing and retention of eggs may have implications for survival and recruitment to the population although at present these implications are not well understood the differential survival of carp eggs depending on hydraulic fate remains an important research topic 5 additional discussion on dispersion coefficient 5 1 parameterization of dispersion coefficient the simulations of egg drift in three increasingly complex channels illustrate the relative importance of capturing these complexities of flow in the resulting spatial and temporal distributions of simulated egg dispersal although a simple analytical solution for a tracer release cannot be used to represent egg transport completely in these channels the comparison between the model results and the analytical solution with different longitudinal dispersion coefficients k l provides useful insights about the model performance in the straight open channel k l k x 5 93 h u agrees quite well with fluegg immediately from the egg release point sdrift results track k l 0 15 h u better in the initial stage and gradually approach k l 5 93 h u in the idealized curved channel both fluegg and sdrift generally agree with k l 80 h u in the representative reach of the lower missouri river longitudinal dispersion of eggs using fluegg agrees with the analytical estimate of transport using k l 30 80 h u whereas the sdrift predicted dispersion coefficients are in agreement with the analytical estimate using k l 200 250 h u from the above comparison we found that both models can accommodate channel morphology which results in two orders of magnitudes for the scaling factors in dispersion coefficient using k l h u both models show an increasing factor with increasing complexity of channel morphology despite the fact that fluegg uses a small constant scaling factor in the horizontal dispersion coefficient k h 0 6 h u the outcome of varying scaling factor in the fluegg simulation results is attributed to the combined effect in the tracking algorithm in both horizontal and vertical direction for instance the law of the wall profile of velocity used in fluegg increases longitudinal dispersion i e faster slower longitudinal movement closer to the water surface channel bottom hence the effective dispersion coefficient is always larger than k h 0 6 h u as indicated from our test results overall fluegg performs reasonably well in a broad range of river and stream parameters in contrast sdrift uses 3 d hydrodynamic data and therefore the effect of velocity gradient is implicitly implemented in addition sdrift directly uses turbulent velocities in the tracking algorithm which can simulate transport processes over a wide range of turbulence conditions for instance sdrift is able to capture weak turbulent mixing in the initial stage and to mimic the natural growth of turbulent diffusion coefficient e g the straight channel simulation see also section 5 2 due to the fundamental difference in the dimensions of input flow characteristics sdrift can reveal much more information relevant to localized velocity gradients meter scale turbulent eddies and influences of hydraulic structures li et al 2022 these complex river characteristics substantially enhance mixing and transport and likely result in large dispersion coefficients that fluegg may underestimate heer et al 2020 2021 5 2 growth of dispersion coefficient the point source release case i e eggs are released in the center of the river allows us to examine the analogy of the richardson law of turbulent diffusion for river dispersion process the richardson law states that the diffusion coefficient grows proportionally to the cloud size to the power of 4 3 richardson and walker 1926 fischer et al 1979 this is because the particles within the cloud typically cannot be separated by the turbulent eddies that are larger than the cloud size i e they can only be advected but not diffused when the cloud size gets larger the spreading rate become larger in river dispersion we expect to see a similar particle spreading process this is particularly true in the early stage of the point source dispersion as we showed in the straight open channel simulation an example of egg particle distributions shows the spreading of egg particles in the river fig 16 we calculated the mean trajectory of egg drift by averaging all particle trajectories and then determined the projected location on the mean trajectory and the distance of each egg to the mean trajectory i e longitudinal and transverse coordinate x l and x t thus the standard deviation of x l and x t denoted as σ l and σ t can be used to represent the cloud size of egg spreading in the longitudinal and transverse direction respectively the cloud size can be used to estimate longitudinal dispersion coefficients k l fischer 1968 12 k l 1 2 d σ l 2 d t the instantaneous longitudinal dispersion coefficients are plotted as a function of time fig 17a the data are quite scattered and the four tested discharges have relatively weak effects on the dispersion coefficients as expected in the point source release k l increases from 0 to about 15 m 2 s within about 500 1000 s after which k l is strongly affected by the river morphology around 3600 s k l in different discharges vary between 20 60 m 2 s these instantaneous values lie in the range of 30 h u to 200 h u for the simulated discharges note that these values are smaller than the case when eggs are released across the entire river width k l 200 h u in the broadly distributed releases the cross section velocity gradient has much stronger effects than that in the point source release in addition a substantial portion of eggs is entrapped and slowed down by vortices in the dike regions when eggs are broadly released the egg cloud spreading data in the early stage shows an analogy of the richardson s 4 3 law fig 17b the later stage of dispersion is strongly affected by the river morphology and hence is not plotted note that k h is the horizontal dispersion coefficient calculated using eq 12 by replacing σ l with σ h σ l 2 σ t 2 the data show a well observed power law relation between k h and the egg cloud size defined as l h 3 σ h the best fit line indicates k h l h 1 1 for the simulated eggs the fitted exponent 1 1 in the power law is slightly smaller than 4 3 this could be partially attributed to the inertia of eggs so that the egg cloud spreads out in a slower rate than tracer particles 6 conclusions in this paper we evaluated a newly developed stochastic egg drift model sdrift in predicting egg transport with gradually increased channel complexity with the comparison to a well known egg tracking model fluegg we evaluated the model performance in a uniformly straight open channel an idealized curved channel and an 8 km reach with in stream hydraulic structures and bed variations in the lower missouri river we demonstrated that both models can address the complexity of the channels and hence provide reasonable predictions of dispersion of eggs although the increased dimensionality of sdrift potentially provides for greater realism in more complex channels in the straight open channel with smooth wall turbulence sdrift yields weaker egg dispersion than that predicted using fluegg the weak dispersion is in part because the initial egg placement is on the surface and therefore eggs experience little vertical shear and minimal horizontal shear due to the smooth straight walled flume the initial stage of dispersion in sdrift agrees with the dispersion coefficient of k l 0 15 h u which is attributed primarily to turbulent diffusion sdrift predicts gradually increased dispersion coefficients that reach k l 5 93 h u where the vertical velocity profile plays the key role in longitudinal dispersion in the idealized curved channel with a sinuosity of 1 38 and reynolds number of 99000 both models predict egg transport with a longitudinal dispersion coefficient k l 80 h u a much higher value than those in the uniformly straight channel sdrift predicts a slightly higher dispersion in the real river with prominent channel training structures we first modeled hydrodynamics with calibrated 3 d cfd simulation code before conducing egg drift modeling due to strong interactions between eggs and turbulence induced by in stream hydraulic structures sdrift predicts strong longitudinal dispersion giving dispersion coefficients in the range of 200 250 h u comparable simulations using fluegg yield 30 80 h u moreover sdrift provides additional information in describing the role of in stream hydraulic structures and localized turbulence on the egg drift process including prediction of a long tail of slowly moving eggs in the upstream which may have implications for survival and recruitment to carp populations using sdrift also allows examining the growth of dispersion coefficients in point source releases we show an analogy of the richardson s power law for turbulent diffusion in the fluvial egg dispersion the simulated egg dispersion data show a power law relation between the horizontal dispersion coefficient and the egg cloud size k h l h 1 1 credit authorship contribution statement geng li

24308,understanding the effects of landscape management on northern bobwhite colinus virginianus population growth requires information on seasonal and stage specific demographic parameters linked across the full annual cycle we evaluated site level seasonal dynamics and population growth of bobwhites in southwest missouri and compared differences between three extensively and two intensively managed sites from 2016 to 2019 extensively managed sites were continuous tracts of native prairie intensively managed sites were composed of smaller native and non native grassland units interspersed with strip crops food plots and woody field borders we radio marked adults and broods to estimate survival and productivity conducted spring whistle counts to estimate abundance and developed a two season two stage two sex integrated population model to estimate population dynamics the number of young hatched per female incubated nest was greater on the three extensively managed sites compared to the two intensively managed sites six month period survival of adults during the breeding season was also greater on the three extensively managed sites compared to the two intensively managed sites one hundred day juvenile breeding season survival varied among sites and was highest on talbot compared to juvenile breeding season survival on the other four study sites six month non breeding season period survival was lowest on the two smallest extensively managed sites stony point prairie and shelton conservation area compared to non breeding season survival on the other three study sites annual changes in bobwhite abundance were weakly correlated with female fecundity though this positive relationship was stronger on extensively managed sites intensively managed sites exhibited low mean fecundity and breeding season adult survival relative to those that resulted in a stable population populations across sites declined from 2016 to 2019 and estimates of annual population growth rates overlapped across sites differences between observed changes in bobwhite abundance and estimates of observed demographic rates at some sites suggest unmeasured processes such as movement or bias associated with data and model assumptions influenced estimated vital rates overall our integrated population model was an effective tool for understanding site level seasonal dynamics and population growth of bobwhites based on comparisons of demography between extensively and intensively managed sites we suggest increased native grassland cover managed with prescribed fire low intensity grazing and high mowing may increase bobwhite nesting success and breeding season adult survival however achieving stable or increasing rates of population growth may also require increased juvenile breeding season and non breeding season survival keywords annual cycle colinus virginianus habitat management integrated population model native grasslands northern bobwhite population dynamics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evaluating seasonal contributions to annual population dynamics is critical for management of species given seasonally specific threats hostetler et al 2015 villellas et al 2015 and the dependent nature of ecological processes occurring across seasons only recently have research efforts focused on evaluation of seasonal components in a full annual cycle framework marra et al 2015 seasonal threats to animal populations may include changes in predator communities habitat disturbances or weather patterns evaluating seasonal dynamics in an annual framework allows study of carry over effects which are processes occurring in one season that explain reproductive success or survival in a subsequent season harrison et al 2011 these intra annual processes driving annual dynamics can be accounted for in a periodic population model to better understand temporal variation in vital rates regulating population growth hunt and tongen 2017 rushing et al 2017 population age structure and composition may also affect the contribution of vital rates to population growth hence researchers often incorporate age structured demographic information in their models but rarely account for male and female composition single sex female based population models assume either 1 sexes exhibit similar vital rates or 2 female dynamics drive population change male and female survival however may differ due to behavioral and or environmental interactions moreover in species where males either contribute to or limit reproductive success biased sex ratios may influence annual fecundity rates violating the assumption of female dominance caswell and weeks 1986 gerber and white 2014 two sex population models are necessary to evaluate population viability where vital rates differ between males and females and where sex ratios may be skewed or vary due to those differences integrated population models ipms provide a holistic approach for leveraging multiple data types to quantify demographic mechanisms of population change while accounting for age and sex structure and testing hypothesized drivers rushing et al 2017 weegman et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 northern bobwhite c virginianus hereafter bobwhite are an early successional shrub obligate upland gamebird of the eastern united states bobwhite have low annual survival and rely on high productivity and recruitment to maintain populations mcconnell et al 2018 bobwhite exhibit a flexible mating system in which both females and males can incubate nests and attend broods as pairs or independently over a relatively long breeding season that allows for multiple nesting attempts roseberry and klimstra 1984 curtis et al 1993 burger et al 1995b bobwhite complete their full life cycle on a single landscape but are exposed to seasonally specific threats stoddard 1931 brennan et al 2014 janke et al 2017 bobwhite have experienced long term rangewide population declines largely explained by habitat loss fragmentation and degradation leopold 1931 brennan 1991 hernández et al 2013 in missouri abundance has declined by 80 since 1967 and rate of loss has accelerated over the past 15 years sauer et al 2017 local exceptions to rangewide declines occur on landscapes purposefully managed for wildlife mcconnell et al 2018 population recovery on an altered landscape requires a better understanding of the influence of management strategies on full annual cycle dynamics traditional wildlife management approaches for bobwhite often incorporate agricultural strip crops food plots and woody field borders among fragmented grassland units and have been applied to many public and private lands hereafter intensively managed sites williams et al 2004 the conservation efficacy of intensively managed sites relative to larger continuous tracts of native grasslands has not been examined management of large native grasslands with fire and low intensity grazing provide bobwhite with a mosaic of habitats suitable for nesting brood rearing foraging and cover hereafter extensively managed sites taylor et al 1999a richardson et al 2020 by contrast agricultural cover on intensively managed sites may reduce nest success and adult survival during the breeding season and reduce usable space for bobwhite during the non breeding season taylor et al 1999b potter et al 2011 janke et al 2013 also proximity to mature woody edges on intensively managed sites may reduce brood success sinnott et al 2021b however the availability of woody vegetation is important during the non breeding season as protective cover janke et al 2015 mosloff et al 2021 bobwhite population growth may be correlated with non breeding season survival breeding season adult survival and number of young hatched folk et al 2007 sandercock et al 2008 gates et al 2012 williams et al 2012 rosenblatt et al 2021 we evaluated bobwhite population dynamics across the full annual cycle at five sites in southwest missouri land management differed among sites two sites were intensively managed and three sites were extensively managed we leveraged whistle count nest monitoring and radio telemetry data in a joint analysis of abundance fecundity and seasonal survival to inform population management of a rapidly declining gamebird on public lands our objectives were to develop a two season two stage i e juveniles and adults two sex integrated population model to estimate population dynamics to 1 evaluate site level variation in seasonal vital rates and annual changes in bobwhite abundance on intensively and extensively managed sites and 2 identify seasonal and sex specific vital rates driving annual population change we predicted bobwhite populations on extensively managed sites would have greater fecundity and seasonal survival probabilities compared to intensively managed sites we predicted that as a species with an especially fast life history strategy characterized by high fecundity and low annual survival rates bobwhite population growth would be most correlated with the number of young hatched and survival of young to fall recruitment we also evaluated how model parameterization handles unmeasured demographic and influences vital rate estimates we predicted vital rates with the least data would be most sensitive to change caused by parameterization our study represents a unique approach to addressing landscape scale effects of management on full annual cycle demography using an unusually complete dataset across the annual cycle of an upland game bird 2 materials and methods we estimated seasonal age and sex specific survival and fecundity as well as abundance and population growth for bobwhite in the eastern tallgrass prairie region of southwest missouri usa from 1 may 2016 to 1 may 2019 fig 1 the gently rolling plains of this region were once dominated by tallgrass prairie interspersed with oak quercus spp woodlands and savannas while the historical prairie landscape has been heavily modified by agriculture this region was identified by the national bobwhite conservation initiative as having high potential for bobwhite recovery palmer et al 2011 our study sites included five conservation areas managed by missouri department of conservation mdc shawnee trail conservation area 1471 ha and robert e talbot conservation area 1764 ha were intensively managed sites which incorporated small units 1 24 ha of agriculture and woody vegetation to provide food and cover for wildlife among grassland units maintained with fire low intensity grazing and mowing fig 2 a fig 2b shelton memorial conservation area 129 ha stony point prairie conservation area 388 ha and wah kon tah prairie 1226 ha were extensively managed sites characterized by continuous tracts of native grassland maintained with fire grazing and mowing fig 2a fig 2c while all sites included grassland units that were burned and grazed the land cover composition and species richness of grasslands were distinct between intensively and extensively managed sites native grasslands on intensively managed sites were either native grass plantings or reconstructed prairies and species richness in these units ranged from fewer than 50 to 100 plant species these grasslands were also smaller 4 28 ha and fragmented by woodland or agricultural management units by contrast native grasslands on extensively managed sites were larger 100 ha continuous native prairie and included of over 200 native plant species while species richness was greater on extensively managed sites compared to intensively managed sites grassland structure was similar across all sites due to similar disturbance regimes applied all conservation areas used low intensity grazing practices consisting of 1 animal unit per 4 5 acres for 90 to 120 days from april to august grazing units were rested every 1 4 years all areas also used patch burn grazing whereby 1 3 of each unit was burned annually or biannually followed by a rest period prescribed burns occurred september april every 1 3 years for the purposes of our study we assumed shawnee trail and talbot represented intensive management and shelton memorial stony point prairie and wah kon tah prairie represented extensive management we acknowledge that this is an observational study and that other factors beyond our control such as study area size and harvest pressure differed among sites private lands surrounding these conservation areas were largely converted to tall fescue festuca arundinacea pastures and row crop fields hunting was permitted on all five study sites except for the southern half of wah kon tah prairie hunting season opened 1 november and closed 15 january on all sites except talbot hunting season on talbot closed 15 dec and only half day hunting was permitted we did not have data on variation in harvest pressure across sites and years 2 1 data we collected survival fecundity and abundance data on our five study sites beginning in february for three complete years 2016 2018 in cooperation with mdc we captured bobwhite using funnel traps in february and march and fitted with uniquely numbered leg bands and 6 g necklace style radio transmitters 5 of adult body mass with an expected battery life of 9 months model awe qii from american wildlife enterprises monticello fl usa radio marked adult bobwhite were tracked at least three times per week to monitor adult breeding season survival we located nests during the breeding season when adults were tracked to the same location on consecutive days we monitored nest fate and the number of eggs hatched per radio marked adult to estimate fecundity once nests hatched and initial brood size was determined based on egg count brood attending adults were tracked daily broods were captured using the corral method before sunrise at around 20 days old smith et al 2003 the number of young surviving from hatch was recorded and one to six juveniles per brood were fitted with backpack transmitters using the suture technique terhune et al 2020 transmitters weighed 0 6 to 0 8 g with an expected battery life of 45 to 60 days respectively and were 4 of juvenile body mass awe qc 0 8 and awe qc 0 65 american wildlife enterprises monticello fl usa sinnott et al 2021a we captured bobwhite using funnel traps in september and october and radio marked adults and juveniles for non breeding season survival estimates using the same protocols as spring trapping mosloff et al 2021 two pulses of trapping in the fall and early spring each year helped ensure adequate sample sizes of birds were available for monitoring in both the breeding and nonbreeding seasons capture and handling protocols were approved by the university of missouri animal care and use committee protocol 8766 mdc conducted bobwhite spring whistle counts 15 may 1 july 2016 2018 on shawnee trail n 16 listening stations shelton memorial n 2 stony point prairie n 8 robert e talbot conservation area n 16 and wah kon tah prairie n 18 whistle count listening stations were established 800 m apart in a grid for complete coverage of each site the number of males calling within 400 m were recorded during a 10 min period between sunrise and 9 00 a m during 1 3 visits annually to each station as an index of population size although whistle counts are an imperfect index of bobwhite abundance they are widely used and we believe our surveys were adequate for this analysis for several reasons hansen and guthery 2001 surveys were repeated by trained wildlife professionals using a standard protocol yeiser et al 2020 additionally 10 min surveys in areas with higher bobwhite densities compared to the surrounding landscape increased the likelihood individuals would be available for detection lituma et al 2017 finally the ipm framework allows for the sharing of information across multiple datasets for greater precision in estimates of true abundance adabi et al 2010 2 2 data analysis we developed an ipm to evaluate site level management effects on seasonal demography and annual population growth of bobwhite populations we linked spring whistle counts with nest monitoring and telemetry datasets to estimate abundance fecundity and survival to explicitly account for processes underlying population change besbeas et al 2002 schaub et al 2007 schaub and abadi 2011 kéry and schaub 2012 zipkin and saunders 2018 fig 3 we also quantified unmeasured processes that accounted for differences between measured demographic data and observed changes in abundance with a scaling parameter robinson et al 2014 these processes may include unmeasured demographic rates such as immigration and emigration they may also include unaccounted for effects of the observation process such as bias caused by violations of model assumptions riecke et al 2019 a scaling parameter is a balancing term that quantifies the difference between observed and estimated population dynamics when not all demographic components are directly informed by data a scaling parameter can be beneficial for obtaining reasonable vital rate estimates when unmeasured processes influence observed dynamics the scaling parameter should be interpreted somewhat cautiously as it also can absorb other model variation the scaling parameter was the proportional difference in annual population growth between observed changes in abundance estimated from count data and projected abundance based on survival and fecundity rates estimated from nest monitoring and telemetry data the size of the scaling parameter reflects the magnitude of the discrepancy between annual demographic and count data a negative estimate for the scaling parameter would indicate changes in population size were lower than what might be expected based on observed survival and fecundity rates suggesting net emigration of individuals from a population a positive estimate for the scaling parameter would indicate changes in population size were greater than what would be expected based on observed survival and fecundity rates which may result from net immigration of individuals into a population or possibly negative effects of tagging on observed survival or fecundity rates we used a two stage two sex periodic matrix design to account for seasonal demographic complexities across the full annual cycle code available online in supporting information our matrix model allowed us to explicitly account for seasonal processes important in understanding intra annual demographic sensitivities guthery et al 2000 doak and morris 2010 villellas et al 2015 hunt and tongen 2017 we estimated demographic rates during both the breeding season 1 may 31 oct and non breeding season 1 nov 30 apr we accounted for differences in survival and productivity among groups of adults and juveniles and males and females burger et al 1995a sandercock et al 2008 we included sex specific productivity rates because bobwhite are polygamous and both females and males contribute to fecundity as nest incubating and brood attending adults curtis et al 1993 burger et al 1995ab we fit our ipm in a bayesian framework with a joint likelihood and prior probability distributions for estimates of abundance survival and productivity we next describe each of the component likelihoods 2 2 1 count likelihood we estimated population size within a poisson binomial mixture model for our observed counts of male bobwhite we summed the total number of individuals heard calling at all listening stations during each round of replicated spring whistle count surveys i for each year t and site j we estimated counts of female bobwhite abundance by multiplying male counts by the ratio of females to males captured during february and march funnel trapping in each year at each site spring whistle count data c i j t were described in a binomial

breeding season juvenile survival 2 breeding season adult survival and 3 non breeding season survival all models estimating daily survival s t j k l included additive fixed effects for year β t and site β j eq 10 each of the three models also included a unique intercept term α the breeding season adult and non breeding season survival models included a fixed binary effect for sex β k sex of juveniles hatched during the breeding season could not be determined and we assumed survival of male and female young from 1 may to 31 oct were equal the non breeding season survival model included a fixed binary age effect for adults and juveniles β l to calculate 6 month period survival estimates for breeding season adults and all non breeding season age and sex classes within the ipm we exponentiated site and year specific female and male daily survival probabilities by 182 days breeding season juvenile survival was estimated from hatch to 100 days old survival in the first 3 weeks of life prior to radio marking individuals was determined within the logistic exposure framework based on the number of young hatched and the number of young captured at roost locations dahlgren et al 2010 schreiber et al 2016 sinnott et al in press while brood amalgamation is a potential source of uncertainty in early survival observations we observed low rates of brood amalgamation 4 of captured individuals for broods 3 weeks old based on differences between expected body mass and brood age during brood captures brood counts from captures at roost locations are a reliable method for estimating chick survival faircloth et al 2005 dahlgren et al 2010 survival for young greater than approximately 3 weeks old was estimated based on observations of radio marked individuals which are not affected by brood amalgamation the breeding season juvenile survival model included a fixed quadratic effect for brood age in days the quadratic effect captured low daily survival rates

kellner 2019 we ran models using three chains each containing 40 000 iterations including a burn in of 10 000 and a thin rate of 5 yielding 18 000 total samples for parameter posterior distribution we evaluated model convergence by inspecting trace plots for all parameters and checking for r hat values of 1 1 brooks and gelman 1998 we present posterior means and 95 credible intervals cri of estimated parameters we interpret effects such as sex and age as influential when their 95 cri did not overlap zero we calculated correlation coefficients r between demographic rates and population growth across their full posterior distributions and we calculated the proportion of correlation coefficients 0 pr r 0 as a measure of the evidence that a positive correlation existed between a demographic parameter and population growth finally we compared seasonal age and sex specific survival and productivity estimates for each site and management strategy to a subset of posterior samples that resulted in a stable population i e we report the distributions of posterior samples that yielded λ 1 00 given variation in posterior estimates of all demographic rates the subset of posteriors that resulted in a stable population provided perspective about thresholds of rates to target for population management sandercock et al 2008 3 results we tracked 766 juveniles and 618 adults during the breeding season and 772 juveniles and 349 adults during the non breeding season to estimate survival probabilities table s1 we monitored success of 276 nests incubated among 576 adults active on 1

population growth rate table s2 fig 3 non breeding season survival at two extensively managed sites shelton and stony point were also lower than rates that resulted in a stable population growth rate table s2 fig 3 the scaling parameter contributed substantially to per capita rates of population change z 0 53 95 cri 0 46 0 60 fig s2 and likely included unmeasured demographic rates such as immigration and or error induced by violations of model assumptions missing abundance data for some sites in some years precluded estimation of a scaling parameter estimating year and site specific differences between demographic and count data when the ipm included a scaling parameter vital rate estimates from the ipm closely matched estimates produced by independent survival and fecundity models without the scaling parameter vital rates informed by less data i e juvenile breeding season survival and non breeding season survival were high compared to estimates produced in an independent survival model fig s1 while estimates of annual population growth were relatively low fig s2 additionally without the scaling parameter all vital rates had 0 90 probability of a positive correlation and the strongest correlations corresponded to vital rates informed by less data again juvenile breeding season survival and non breeding season survival table s4 4 discussion ipms are the newest approach to evaluating full annual cycle population dynamics and over the past ten years their utility and flexibility have been increasingly tested and developed ipms have been used to estimate unobserved demographic rates and their relationships to environmental conditions and population change e g abadi et al 2010 we constructed a site based full annual cycle two sex two stage ipm that included a scaling parameter to account for unmeasured demographic processes we evaluated the effects of landscape scale differences in management practices on the full annual cycle demography of bobwhite while the sensitivity of ipms to latent or data poor processes is more recently being acknowledged and evaluated riecke et al 2019 wiegers et al 2022 our unique dataset with nearly complete data across all life stages and seasons suggests understanding of full annual cycle population dynamics is highly sensitive to unobserved demographic processes previous studies evaluating bobwhite population dynamics within an ipm framework have used long term incomplete demographic datasets to evaluate weather effects on the highly variable dynamics of the bobwhite full annual cycle in population strongholds of northern and southeastern portions of the species range mcconnell et al 2018 rosenblatt et al 2021 our ipm evaluated site specific vital rates and population growth across two intensively managed sites and three extensively managed sites in a population centrally located within the species range estimates for all seasons and life stages were informed by data and we used a scaling parameter to quantify unmeasured processes influencing estimated population dynamics we found significant differences in estimates of vital rates that were data poor with and without a scaling parameter we also found relationships between vital rates and annual changes in population growth were sensitive to the inclusion of a scaling parameter while ipms can estimate vital rates where data are missing our results highlight the sensitivity of any latent or data poor demographic parameter estimates which may absorb variation from multiple unmeasured demographic processes or data bias these demographic estimates should be interpreted cautiously we found bobwhite populations on extensively managed sites composed of intact native prairies hatched more young per female and had greater breeding season adult survival compared to intensively managed sites composed of strip crops woodlands and native grass plantings and reconstructed prairies with lower plant richness compared to intact prairies age and sex specific differences in seasonal survival probabilities as well as male contributions to reproductive success underscored the importance of accounting for population structure and composition in evaluation of bobwhite full annual cycle demography we did not find strong correlations between vital rates and population growth for all sites and years pooled however management strategies were associated with site specific differences in vital rates limiting population growth for example female fecundity and breeding season adult survival on intensively managed sites were lower than rates from posteriors that resulted in a stable population while non breeding season survival was lower on extensively managed sites that effect may have been driven by low survival on the two smallest sites we also found significant differences between estimated vital rates and observed annual changes in bobwhite abundance due to unmeasured processes which may have included movement of individuals into a population or biased data and violations of model assumptions unmeasured demographic processes will be discussed further below 4 1 population growth while there was overlap in site level estimates of population growth results weakly suggested annual population growth rates were greater on extensively managed sites compared to intensively managed sites while our seasonal demographic rates were within the range of previous studies that investigated declining bobwhite populations population growth rates were well below those required for a stable population sandercock et al 2008 janke et al 2017 mcconnell et al 2018 annual indices of bobwhite abundance are highly variable and even long term stable populations experience multi year periods of decline and growth mcconnell et al 2018 regional population strongholds are also vulnerable to periods of population decline rosenblatt et al 2021 long term monitoring of these bobwhite populations would be needed for a robust assessment of population viability ross and weegman 2022 4 2 breeding season fecundity while males contributed to productivity through nest incubation and brood rearing the proportion of males that incubated a nest and the number of young hatched per male was a fraction of per capita female fecundity during the breeding season male fecundity was also not correlated with population growth we found female fecundity was greater on extensively managed sites compared to intensively managed sites on intensively managed sites the number of young hatched per female were low relative to estimates that resulted in stable populations as an r selected species with low annual survival we expected fecundity to influence population growth rate sæther and bakke 2000 stahl and oli 2006 folk et al 2007 gates et al 2012 taylor et al 2012 we found a weak correlation between changes in abundance and the number of eggs hatched from female incubated nests on extensively managed sites composed of native grasslands managed with prescribed fire and grazing however there was no correlation on intensively managed sites or among sites and years lack of correlation may be due to a declining bobwhite population trajectory in southwest missouri for stable populations of r selected species fecundity may explain variation in population growth but in declining populations survival can have a stronger influence on changes in abundance meats 1971 sandercock et al 2008 mcconnell et al 2018 while we did not estimate effects of environmental covariates greater availability of native grassland vegetation and reduced mature tree cover may increase fecundity on intensively managed sites taylor et al 1999b potter et al 2011 4 3 breeding season juvenile survival long term capture recapture data from a stable population in the southeastern pine savannas of tall timbers research station in florida estimated a 100 day period survival of 0 32 95 ci 0 18 0 44 terhune et al 2019 based on mark recapture of chicks banded around 2 weeks old breeding season juvenile survival in a northern population of bobwhite estimated as a latent variable within an ipm was 0 67 95 ci 0 03 1 0 breeding season juvenile survival in southwest missouri based on radio telemetry data were lower than those previous estimates mean 0 21 95 cri 0 06 0 45 survival varied among sites and did not differ between intensively and extensively managed conservation areas juvenile survival was low relative to estimates that resulted in a stable population across all sites apart from talbot juvenile survival is sensitive to habitat suitability and availability of brood habitat may be limiting on both intensive and extensively managed sites tanner et al 2019 in southwest missouri broods selected for native grasslands that were burned and grazed on public lands as well as agricultural cover on intensively managed sites and private lands sinnott et al 2021a both native grasslands managed with fire and grazing and agricultural cover in small strip crop fields were available to broods on talbot bobwhite broods prefer habitat with bare ground forb cover and tall vegetation and survival is greatest on native grasslands managed with rotational fire and grazing taylor et al 1999a sinnott et al 2021b increasing the availability of native grasslands managed with fire and grazing and shrub cover may improve brood rearing habitat and survival on both intensively and extensively managed sites taylor et al 1999a brooke et al 2017 sinnott et al 2021ab 4 4 breeding season adult survival adult breeding season survival was slightly lower for females than for males while we did not compare survival of non reproductive incubating and brood rearing individuals risks associated with reproductive behaviors may have contributed to lower female survival burger et al 1995a other studies have found declining bobwhite populations to be sensitive to adult summer survival sandercock et al 2008 gates et al 2012 williams et al 2012 we found adult breeding season survival was not strongly correlated with population growth across our sites during the study period however survival probabilities on intensively managed sites were lower than those on extensively managed sites and lower than those that resulted in a stable population breeding season adult survival on these sites may increase with increased availability of grasslands and reduced use of forested areas taylor et al 1999b lohr et al 2011 4 5 non breeding season survival previous field simulation and meta analysis studies have found non breeding season survival contributes disproportionately to abundance trends especially for northern populations of bobwhite folk et al 2007 sandercock et al 2008 link et al 2008 williams et al 2012 rosenblatt et al 2021 we found across all sites except for talbot higher non breeding season survival was required to achieve population stability bobwhite face multiple pressures during the non breeding season population density covey dynamics and landscape composition influence non breeding season survival patterns in winter bobwhite benefit from grassland landscapes that provide permanent cover with ample shrubby vegetation williams et al 2000 lohr et al 2011 janke and gates 2013 janke et al 2015 mosloff et al 2021 thus we expected winter survival to be highest on our native grassland sites however we found survival was highest on an intensively managed site talbot followed by our largest extensively managed site wah kon tah prairie these sites are among the largest conservation areas in our study talbot has more woody cover than other sites bobwhite select for woody cover in winter and it may increase survival janke et al 2015 mosloff et al 2021 wah kon tah prairie is larger than the other two extensively managed sites has proportionately more woody cover than shelton memorial and half of the site is closed to hunting non breeding season survival was lowest at the smallest conservation areas stony point prairie and shelton memorial small coveys especially in low density populations experience reduced winter survival if they remain isolated or must make large movements to find additional members williams et al 2003a williams et al 2003b williams et al 2000 janke and gates 2013 evaluating effects of area sensitivity density dependence and effects of vegetation weather and harvest pressure was beyond the scope of this study but one or more of these factors may have contributed to site level patterns in non breeding season survival guthery et al 2000 williams et al 2000 williams et al 2003b janke et al 2015 our results would also benefit from further evaluation of survival during transitional periods between the non breeding and breeding seasons greater sage grouse experience reduced survival during these transitional periods between mid winter and summer breeding seasons due to increased depredation blomberg et al 2013a blomberg et al 2013b we do not yet know if non breeding season survival probabilities are driven by winter processes 1 december 28 february or changes during spring 1 march 30 april when coveys break up and individuals establish territories achieving greater minimum non breeding season survival would improve population viability 4 6 unmeasured demographic processes and other model uncertainties a scaling parameter within our ipm quantified unmeasured demographic processes and improved accuracy of demographic rate estimation by accounting for differences in observed abundances and projected abundances based on vital rates robinson et al 2014 riecke et al 2019 we assumed a constant rate for this scaling parameter due to limitations in our count data that prevented estimation of variation across sites and years this may be a reasonable assumption as other studies have found scaling parameters among several species show low annual variation and there is evidence of consistent bias in telemetry based estimates of bobwhite survival guthery and lusk 2004 robinson et al 2014 the scaling parameter revealed significant differences between estimated demographic rates and changes in population size 0 53 95 cri 0 46 0 60 without the scaling parameter demographic rates informed by the least data juvenile breeding season survival and non breeding season survival were estimated high relative to estimates from independent submodels additionally the correlation between these rates and annual changes in abundance was only credible without the scaling parameter our understanding of full annual cycle dynamics for bobwhite was significantly affected by variation in available data and parameterization of the model this difference between observed population changes and estimated demographic rates may be partly explained by immigration while bobwhite populations are relatively sedentary individuals can disperse distances 5 km within a season and declining bobwhite populations may rely on immigration for long term persistence lohr et al 2011 movements to and from populations are difficult to quantify and may be measured directly through intensive marking and monitoring of new recruits or collecting genetic information millon et al 2019 this difference quantified by the scaling parameter may also be explained by violations of model assumptions an assumption in radiotelemetry methodology is survival and reproduction of radio marked individuals are observed perfectly and these rates are equal to that of unmarked individuals however this may not always be true body et al 2017 several studies have suggested telemetry based estimates of adult bobwhite survival may be biased low cox et al 2004 guthery and lusk 2004 sandercock et al 2008 barron et al 2010 although this may not be universal across studies palmer and wellendorf 2007 and has not been evaluated for telemetry based estimates of juvenile survival we also assumed perfect detection of nests of radio marked adults during the breeding season if all nests were not detected by technicians fecundity estimates may be biased low finally we assumed daily survival rates were constant within the breeding and the non breeding season and discounting any within season temporal trends may bias period survival estimates derived from exponentiated daily survival rates weiser 2021 without additional genetic or capture recapture data we are unable to separate contributions of immigration and potential biases associated with demographic data contributing to the scaling parameter within our ipm we recommend integrating additional data types to better quantify immigration and designing telemetry analyses within a multistate framework to account for imperfect observations of survival and fecundity for reduced potential bias devineau et al 2014 millon et al 2019 weegman et al 2021 5 conclusions our study was constrained by the number of sites and years for which we could estimate demography because of the large field effort required to measure these parameters other site level attributes such as study area size and landscape context were to some extent confounded with management strategy and difficult to tease apart because of limited replication the limited number of sites and years the lack of environmental covariates as well as bobwhite s highly variable demography may have contributed to wide credible intervals in site specific demographic estimates despite these limitations we found multiple low seasonal vital rates resulted in annual declines in bobwhite abundance fine scale habitat management practices such as establishment of food plots field borders and woody strips applied on intensively managed sites may not optimize habitat for nesting and adult breeding season survival we encourage further research into environmental factors influencing these seasonal vital rates we also encourage future studies to cautiously interpret latent demographic parameters and

24308,understanding the effects of landscape management on northern bobwhite colinus virginianus population growth requires information on seasonal and stage specific demographic parameters linked across the full annual cycle we evaluated site level seasonal dynamics and population growth of bobwhites in southwest missouri and compared differences between three extensively and two intensively managed sites from 2016 to 2019 extensively managed sites were continuous tracts of native prairie intensively managed sites were composed of smaller native and non native grassland units interspersed with strip crops food plots and woody field borders we radio marked adults and broods to estimate survival and productivity conducted spring whistle counts to estimate abundance and developed a two season two stage two sex integrated population model to estimate population dynamics the number of young hatched per female incubated nest was greater on the three extensively managed sites compared to the two intensively managed sites six month period survival of adults during the breeding season was also greater on the three extensively managed sites compared to the two intensively managed sites one hundred day juvenile breeding season survival varied among sites and was highest on talbot compared to juvenile breeding season survival on the other four study sites six month non breeding season period survival was lowest on the two smallest extensively managed sites stony point prairie and shelton conservation area compared to non breeding season survival on the other three study sites annual changes in bobwhite abundance were weakly correlated with female fecundity though this positive relationship was stronger on extensively managed sites intensively managed sites exhibited low mean fecundity and breeding season adult survival relative to those that resulted in a stable population populations across sites declined from 2016 to 2019 and estimates of annual population growth rates overlapped across sites differences between observed changes in bobwhite abundance and estimates of observed demographic rates at some sites suggest unmeasured processes such as movement or bias associated with data and model assumptions influenced estimated vital rates overall our integrated population model was an effective tool for understanding site level seasonal dynamics and population growth of bobwhites based on comparisons of demography between extensively and intensively managed sites we suggest increased native grassland cover managed with prescribed fire low intensity grazing and high mowing may increase bobwhite nesting success and breeding season adult survival however achieving stable or increasing rates of population growth may also require increased

dynamics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evaluating seasonal contributions to annual population dynamics is critical for management of species given seasonally specific threats hostetler et al 2015 villellas et al 2015 and the dependent nature of ecological processes occurring across seasons only recently have research efforts focused on evaluation of seasonal components in a full annual cycle framework marra et al 2015 seasonal threats to animal populations may include changes in predator communities habitat disturbances or weather patterns evaluating seasonal dynamics in an annual framework allows study of carry over effects which are processes occurring in one season that explain reproductive success or survival in a subsequent season harrison et al 2011 these intra annual processes driving annual dynamics can be accounted for in a periodic population model to better understand temporal variation in vital rates regulating population growth hunt and tongen 2017 rushing et al 2017 population age structure and composition may also affect the contribution of vital rates to population growth hence researchers often incorporate age structured demographic information in their models but rarely account for male and female composition single sex female based population models assume either 1 sexes exhibit similar vital rates or 2 female dynamics drive population change male and female survival however may differ due to behavioral and or environmental interactions moreover in species where males either contribute to or limit reproductive success biased sex ratios may influence annual fecundity rates violating the assumption of female dominance caswell and weeks 1986 gerber and white 2014 two sex population models are necessary to evaluate population viability where vital rates differ between males and females and where sex ratios may be skewed or vary due to those differences integrated population models ipms provide a holistic approach for leveraging multiple data types to quantify demographic mechanisms of population change while accounting for age and sex structure and testing hypothesized drivers rushing et al 2017 weegman et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 northern bobwhite c virginianus hereafter bobwhite are an early successional shrub obligate upland gamebird of the eastern united states bobwhite have low annual survival and rely on high productivity and recruitment to maintain populations mcconnell et al 2018 bobwhite exhibit a flexible mating system in which both females and males can incubate nests and attend broods as pairs or independently over a relatively long breeding season that allows for multiple nesting attempts roseberry and klimstra 1984 curtis et al 1993 burger et al 1995b bobwhite complete their full life cycle on a single landscape but are exposed to seasonally specific threats stoddard 1931 brennan et al 2014 janke et al 2017 bobwhite have experienced long term rangewide population declines largely explained by habitat loss fragmentation and degradation leopold 1931 brennan 1991 hernández et al 2013 in missouri abundance has declined by 80 since 1967 and rate of loss has accelerated over the past 15 years sauer et al 2017 local exceptions to rangewide declines occur on landscapes purposefully managed for wildlife mcconnell et al 2018 population recovery on an altered landscape requires a better understanding of the influence of management strategies on full annual cycle dynamics traditional wildlife management approaches for bobwhite often incorporate agricultural strip crops food plots and woody field borders among fragmented grassland units and have been applied to many public and private lands hereafter intensively managed sites williams et al 2004 the conservation efficacy of intensively managed sites relative to larger continuous tracts of native grasslands has not been examined management of large native grasslands with fire and low intensity grazing provide bobwhite with a mosaic of habitats suitable for nesting brood rearing foraging and cover hereafter extensively managed sites taylor et al 1999a richardson et al 2020 by contrast agricultural cover on intensively managed sites may reduce nest success and adult survival during the breeding season and reduce usable space for bobwhite during the non breeding season taylor et al 1999b potter et al 2011 janke et al 2013 also proximity to mature woody edges on intensively managed sites may reduce brood success sinnott et al 2021b however the availability of woody vegetation is important during the non breeding season as protective cover janke et al 2015 mosloff et al 2021 bobwhite population growth may be correlated with non breeding season survival breeding season adult survival and number of young hatched folk et al 2007 sandercock et al 2008 gates et al 2012 williams et al 2012 rosenblatt et al 2021 we evaluated bobwhite population dynamics across the full annual cycle at five sites in southwest missouri land management differed among sites two sites were intensively managed and three sites were extensively managed we leveraged whistle count nest monitoring and radio telemetry data in a joint analysis of abundance fecundity and seasonal survival to inform population management of a rapidly declining gamebird on public lands our objectives were to develop a two season two stage i e juveniles and adults two sex integrated population model to estimate population dynamics to 1 evaluate site level variation in seasonal vital rates and annual changes in bobwhite abundance on intensively and extensively managed sites and 2 identify seasonal and sex specific vital rates driving annual population change we predicted bobwhite populations on extensively managed sites would have greater fecundity and seasonal survival probabilities compared to intensively managed sites we predicted that as a species with an especially fast life history strategy characterized by high fecundity and low annual survival rates bobwhite population growth would be most correlated with the number of young hatched and survival of young to fall recruitment we also evaluated how model parameterization handles unmeasured demographic and influences vital rate estimates we predicted vital rates with the least data would be most sensitive to change caused by parameterization our study represents a unique approach to addressing landscape scale effects of management on full annual cycle demography using an unusually complete dataset across the annual cycle of an upland game bird 2 materials and methods we estimated seasonal age and sex specific survival and fecundity as well as abundance and population growth for bobwhite in the eastern tallgrass prairie region of southwest missouri usa from 1 may 2016 to 1 may 2019 fig 1 the gently rolling plains of this region were once dominated by tallgrass prairie interspersed with oak quercus spp woodlands and savannas while the historical prairie landscape has been heavily modified by agriculture this region was identified by the national bobwhite conservation initiative as having high potential for bobwhite recovery palmer et al 2011 our study sites included five conservation areas managed by missouri department of conservation mdc shawnee trail conservation area

prairie 1226 ha were extensively managed sites characterized by continuous tracts of native grassland maintained with fire grazing and mowing fig 2a fig 2c while all sites included grassland units that were burned and grazed the land cover composition and species richness of grasslands were distinct between intensively and extensively managed sites native grasslands on intensively managed sites were either native grass plantings or reconstructed prairies and species richness in these units ranged from fewer than 50 to 100 plant species these grasslands were also smaller 4 28 ha and fragmented by woodland or agricultural management units by contrast native grasslands on extensively managed sites were larger 100 ha continuous native prairie and included of over 200 native plant species while species richness was greater on extensively managed sites compared to intensively managed sites grassland structure was similar across all sites due to similar disturbance regimes applied all conservation areas used low intensity grazing practices consisting of 1 animal unit per 4 5 acres for 90 to 120 days from april to august grazing units were rested every 1 4 years all areas also used patch burn grazing whereby 1 3 of each unit was burned annually or biannually followed by a rest period prescribed burns occurred september april every 1 3 years for the purposes of our study we assumed shawnee trail and talbot represented intensive management and shelton memorial stony point prairie and wah kon tah prairie represented extensive management we acknowledge that this is an observational study and that other factors beyond our control such as study area size and harvest pressure differed among sites private lands surrounding these conservation areas were largely converted to tall fescue festuca arundinacea pastures and row crop fields hunting was permitted on all five study sites except for the southern half of wah kon tah prairie hunting season opened 1 november and closed 15 january on all sites except talbot hunting season on talbot closed 15 dec and only half day hunting was permitted we did not have data on variation in harvest pressure across sites and years 2 1 data we collected survival fecundity and abundance data on our five study sites beginning in february for three complete years 2016 2018 in cooperation with mdc we captured bobwhite using funnel traps in february and march and fitted with uniquely numbered leg bands and 6 g necklace style radio transmitters 5 of adult body mass with an expected battery life of 9 months model awe qii from american wildlife enterprises monticello fl usa radio marked adult bobwhite were tracked at least three times per week to monitor adult breeding season survival we located nests during the breeding season when adults were tracked to the same location on consecutive days we monitored nest fate and the number of eggs hatched per radio marked adult to estimate fecundity once nests hatched and initial brood size was determined based on egg count brood attending adults were tracked daily broods were captured using the corral method before sunrise at around 20 days old smith et al 2003 the number of young surviving from hatch was recorded and one to six juveniles per brood were fitted with backpack transmitters using the suture technique terhune et al 2020 transmitters weighed 0 6 to 0 8 g with an expected battery life of 45 to 60 days respectively and were 4 of juvenile body mass awe qc 0 8 and awe qc 0 65 american wildlife enterprises monticello fl usa sinnott et al 2021a we captured bobwhite using funnel traps in september and october and radio marked adults and juveniles for non breeding season survival estimates using the same protocols as spring trapping mosloff et al 2021 two pulses of trapping in the fall and early spring each year helped ensure adequate sample sizes of birds were available for monitoring in both the breeding and nonbreeding seasons capture and handling protocols were approved by the university of missouri animal care and use committee protocol 8766 mdc conducted bobwhite spring whistle counts 15 may 1 july 2016 2018 on shawnee trail n 16 listening stations shelton memorial n 2 stony point prairie n 8 robert e talbot conservation area n 16 and wah kon tah prairie n 18 whistle count listening stations were established 800 m apart in a grid for complete coverage of each site the number of males calling within 400 m were recorded during a 10 min period between sunrise and 9 00 a m during 1 3 visits annually to each station as an index of population size although whistle counts are an imperfect index of bobwhite abundance they are widely used and we believe our surveys were adequate for this analysis for several reasons hansen and guthery 2001 surveys were repeated by trained wildlife professionals using a standard protocol yeiser et al 2020 additionally 10 min surveys in areas with higher bobwhite densities compared to the surrounding landscape increased the likelihood individuals would be available for detection lituma et al 2017 finally the ipm framework allows for the sharing of information across multiple datasets for greater precision in estimates of true abundance adabi et al 2010 2 2 data analysis we developed an ipm to evaluate site level management effects on seasonal demography and annual population growth of bobwhite populations we linked spring whistle counts with nest monitoring and telemetry datasets to estimate abundance fecundity and survival to explicitly account for processes underlying population change besbeas et al 2002 schaub et al 2007 schaub and abadi 2011 kéry and schaub 2012 zipkin and saunders 2018 fig 3 we also quantified unmeasured processes that accounted for differences between measured demographic data and observed changes in abundance with a scaling parameter robinson et al 2014 these processes may include unmeasured demographic rates such as immigration and emigration they may also include unaccounted for effects of the observation process such as bias caused by violations of model assumptions riecke et al 2019 a scaling parameter is a balancing term that quantifies the difference between observed and estimated population dynamics when not all demographic components are directly informed by data a scaling parameter can be beneficial for obtaining reasonable vital rate estimates when unmeasured processes influence observed dynamics the scaling parameter should be interpreted somewhat cautiously as it also can absorb other model variation the scaling parameter was the proportional difference in annual population growth between observed changes in abundance estimated from count data and projected abundance based on survival and fecundity rates estimated from nest monitoring and telemetry data the size of the scaling parameter reflects the magnitude of the discrepancy between annual demographic and count data a negative estimate for the scaling parameter would indicate changes in population size were lower than what might be expected based on observed survival and fecundity rates suggesting net emigration of individuals from a population a positive estimate for the scaling parameter would indicate changes in population size were greater than what would be expected based on observed survival and fecundity rates which may result from net immigration of individuals into a population or possibly negative effects of tagging on observed survival or fecundity rates we used a two stage two sex periodic matrix design to account for seasonal demographic complexities across the full annual cycle code available online in supporting information our matrix model allowed us to explicitly account for seasonal processes important in understanding intra annual demographic sensitivities guthery et al 2000 doak and morris 2010 villellas et al 2015 hunt and tongen 2017 we estimated demographic rates during both the breeding season 1 may 31 oct and non breeding season 1 nov 30 apr we accounted for differences in survival and productivity among groups of adults and juveniles and males and females burger et al 1995a sandercock et al 2008 we included sex specific productivity rates because bobwhite are polygamous and both females and males contribute to fecundity as nest incubating and brood attending adults curtis et al 1993 burger et al 1995ab we fit our ipm in a bayesian framework with a joint likelihood and prior probability distributions for estimates of abundance survival and productivity we next describe each of the component likelihoods 2 2 1 count likelihood we estimated population size within a poisson binomial mixture model for our observed counts of male bobwhite we summed the total number of individuals heard calling at all listening stations during each round of replicated spring whistle count surveys i for each year t and site j we estimated counts of female bobwhite abundance by multiplying male counts by the ratio of females to males captured during february and march funnel trapping in each year at each site spring whistle count data c i j t were described in a binomial regression eq 1 as part of the observation process within a state space model abundance n j t was estimated as a function of the number of individuals detected on surveys and a constant detection

each sex k while bobwhite exhibit a flexible mating system nests were overwhelmingly attended by a uniparental incubator and did not receive biparental care even among breeding pairs the number of eggs hatched contributed to either female or male fecundity depending on the sex of the individual incubating the nest adults who were alive 1 may but did not incubate or hatch a nest were included in the count of adults in the fecundity ratio the number of eggs hatched included first nests renests after failed attempts and rarely second successful nests we estimated fecundity in a poisson

exposure likelihoods in our ipm to estimate seasonal age and sex specific survival eq 8 code available online in supporting information this generalized linear mixed model included a modified link function which allowed interval length between survival observations d to vary without biasing estimates of daily survival eq 9 shaffer 2004 shaffer and thompson 2007 the three likelihoods included 1 breeding season juvenile survival 2 breeding season adult survival and 3 non breeding season survival all models estimating daily survival s t j k l included additive fixed effects for year β t and site β j eq 10 each of the three models also included a unique intercept term α the breeding season adult and non breeding season survival models included a fixed binary effect for sex β k sex of juveniles hatched during the breeding season could not be determined and we assumed survival of male and female young from 1 may to 31 oct were equal the non breeding season survival model included a fixed binary age effect for adults and juveniles β l to calculate 6 month period survival estimates for breeding season adults and all non breeding season age and sex classes within the ipm we exponentiated site and year specific female and male daily survival probabilities by 182 days breeding season juvenile survival was estimated from hatch to 100 days old survival in the first 3 weeks of life prior to radio marking individuals was determined within the logistic exposure framework based on the number of young hatched and the number of young captured at roost locations dahlgren et al 2010 schreiber et al 2016 sinnott et al in press while brood amalgamation is a potential source of uncertainty in early survival observations we observed low rates of brood amalgamation 4 of captured individuals for broods 3 weeks old based on differences between expected body mass and brood age during brood captures brood counts from captures at roost locations are a reliable method for estimating chick survival faircloth et al 2005 dahlgren et al 2010 survival for young greater than approximately 3 weeks old was estimated based on observations of radio marked individuals which are not affected by brood amalgamation the breeding season juvenile survival model included a fixed quadratic effect for brood age in days the quadratic effect captured low daily survival rates immediately post hatch which increased rapidly and then stabilized during the late developmental period to calculate period survival for breeding season juveniles we first calculated daily survival probabilities from hatch to 100 days old and then took the product of a vector of survival probabilities from age on day 1 to day 100 one hundred day period juvenile summer survival estimates reflect

2016 through 2018 we projected bobwhite abundance and population change for 2019 by sampling from the posterior distribution of our 2018 demographic rates and estimated site specific pre breeding season abundance kéry and schaub 2012 oppel et al 2014 we fit our ipm in a bayesian framework in program r version 3 6 1 using jags via the jagsui package r core development team 2021 plummer 2003 kellner 2019 we ran models using three chains each containing 40 000 iterations including a burn in of 10 000 and a thin rate of 5 yielding 18 000 total samples for parameter posterior distribution we evaluated model convergence by inspecting trace plots for all parameters and checking for r hat values of 1 1 brooks and gelman 1998 we present posterior means and 95 credible intervals cri of estimated parameters we interpret effects such as sex and age as influential when their 95 cri did not overlap zero we calculated correlation coefficients r between demographic rates and population growth across their full posterior distributions and we calculated the proportion of correlation coefficients 0 pr r 0 as a measure of the evidence that a positive correlation existed between a demographic parameter and population growth finally we compared seasonal age and sex specific survival and productivity estimates for each site and management strategy to a subset of posterior samples that resulted in a stable population i e we report the distributions of posterior samples that yielded λ 1 00 given variation in posterior estimates of all demographic rates the subset of posteriors that resulted in a stable population provided perspective about thresholds of rates to target for population management sandercock et al 2008 3 results we tracked 766 juveniles and 618 adults during the breeding season and 772 juveniles and 349 adults during the non breeding season to estimate survival probabilities table s1 we monitored success of 276 nests incubated among 576 adults active on 1 may at the start of the breeding season across all years mdc conducted three rounds of bobwhite spring whistle counts on shawnee trail shelton memorial and stony point prairie annually 2016 2018 two rounds on robert e talbot conservation area in 2017 on wah kon tah prairie mdc conducted three rounds of spring whistle counts in 2016 and two in 2017 and 2018 while the number of replicated counts differed among areas the binomial mixture model was flexible enough to allow varying intensity in sampling effort bobwhite site level seasonal survival and fecundity probabilities were highly variable from 2016 through 2018 fig 4 table s2 during the breeding season the number of young hatched per female was greater than the number of young hatched per male across all sites and years 58 4 of females active 1 may survived and incubated one or more nests compared to only 16 5 of males as a result female fecundity was more than 4 times greater than male fecundity f f 3 26 95 cri 2 14 4 52 f m 0 68

which seasonal vital rates most limited population growth at each site female fecundity and adult breeding season survival at intensively managed sites were lower than rates that resulted in a stable population growth rate table s2 fig 3 non breeding season survival at two extensively managed sites shelton and stony point were also lower than rates that resulted in a stable population growth rate table s2 fig 3 the scaling parameter contributed substantially to per capita rates of population change z 0 53 95 cri 0 46 0 60 fig s2 and likely included unmeasured demographic rates such as immigration and or error induced by violations of model assumptions missing abundance data for some sites in some years precluded estimation of a scaling parameter estimating year and site specific differences between demographic and count data when the ipm included a scaling parameter vital rate estimates from the ipm closely matched estimates produced by independent survival and fecundity models without the scaling parameter vital rates informed by less data i e juvenile breeding season survival and non breeding season survival were high compared to estimates produced in an independent survival model fig s1 while estimates of annual population growth were relatively low fig s2 additionally without the scaling parameter all vital rates had 0 90 probability of a positive correlation and the strongest correlations corresponded to vital rates informed by less data again juvenile breeding season survival and non breeding season survival table s4 4 discussion ipms are the newest approach to evaluating full annual cycle population dynamics and over the past ten years their utility and flexibility have been increasingly tested and developed ipms have been used to estimate unobserved demographic rates and their relationships to environmental conditions and population change e g abadi et al 2010 we constructed a site based full annual cycle two sex two stage ipm that included a scaling parameter to account for unmeasured demographic processes we evaluated the effects of landscape scale differences in management practices on the full annual cycle demography of bobwhite while the sensitivity of ipms to latent or data poor processes is more recently being acknowledged and evaluated riecke et al 2019 wiegers et al 2022 our unique dataset with nearly complete data across all life stages and seasons suggests understanding of full annual cycle population dynamics is highly sensitive to unobserved demographic processes previous studies evaluating bobwhite population dynamics within an ipm framework have used long term incomplete demographic datasets to evaluate weather effects on the highly variable dynamics of the bobwhite full annual cycle in population strongholds of northern and southeastern portions of the species range mcconnell et al 2018 rosenblatt et al 2021 our ipm evaluated site specific vital rates and population growth across two intensively managed sites and three extensively managed sites in a population centrally located within the species range estimates for all seasons and life stages were informed by data and we used a scaling parameter to quantify unmeasured processes influencing estimated population dynamics we found significant differences in estimates of vital rates that were data poor with and without a scaling parameter we also found relationships between vital rates and annual changes in population growth were sensitive to the inclusion of a scaling parameter while ipms can estimate vital rates where data are missing our results highlight the sensitivity of any latent or data poor demographic parameter estimates which may absorb variation from multiple unmeasured demographic processes or data bias these demographic estimates should be interpreted cautiously we found bobwhite populations on extensively managed sites composed of intact native prairies hatched more young per female and had greater breeding season adult survival compared to intensively managed sites composed of strip crops woodlands and native grass plantings and reconstructed prairies with lower plant richness compared to intact prairies age and sex specific differences in seasonal survival probabilities as well as male contributions to reproductive success underscored the importance of accounting for population structure and composition in evaluation of bobwhite full annual cycle demography we did not find strong correlations between vital rates and population growth for all sites and years pooled however management strategies were associated with site specific differences in vital rates limiting population growth for example female fecundity and breeding season adult survival on intensively managed sites were lower than rates from posteriors that resulted in a stable population while non breeding season survival was lower on extensively managed sites that effect may have been driven by low survival on the two smallest sites we also found significant differences between estimated vital rates and observed annual changes in bobwhite abundance due to unmeasured processes which may have included movement of individuals into a population or biased data and violations of model assumptions unmeasured demographic processes will be discussed further below 4 1 population growth while there was overlap in site level estimates of population growth results weakly suggested annual population growth rates were greater on extensively managed sites compared to intensively managed sites while our seasonal demographic rates were within the range of previous studies that investigated declining bobwhite populations population growth rates were well below those required for a stable population sandercock et al 2008 janke et al 2017 mcconnell et al 2018 annual indices of bobwhite abundance are highly variable and even long term stable populations experience multi year periods of decline and growth mcconnell et al 2018 regional population strongholds are also vulnerable to periods of population decline rosenblatt et al 2021 long term monitoring of these bobwhite populations would be needed for a robust assessment of population viability ross and weegman 2022 4 2 breeding season fecundity while males contributed to productivity through nest incubation and brood rearing the proportion of males that incubated a nest and the number of young hatched per male was a fraction of per capita female fecundity during the breeding season male fecundity was also not correlated with population growth we found female fecundity was greater on extensively managed sites compared to intensively managed sites on intensively managed sites the number of young hatched per female were low relative to estimates that resulted in stable populations as an r selected species with low annual survival we expected fecundity to influence population growth rate sæther and bakke 2000 stahl and oli 2006 folk et al 2007 gates et al 2012 taylor et al 2012 we found a weak correlation between changes in abundance and the number of eggs hatched from female incubated nests on extensively managed sites composed of native grasslands managed with prescribed fire and grazing however there was no correlation on intensively managed sites or among sites and years lack of correlation may be due to a declining bobwhite population trajectory in southwest missouri for stable populations of r selected species fecundity may explain variation in population growth but in declining populations survival can have a stronger influence on changes in abundance meats 1971 sandercock et al 2008 mcconnell et al 2018 while we did not estimate effects of environmental covariates greater availability of native grassland vegetation and reduced mature tree cover may increase fecundity on intensively managed sites taylor et al 1999b potter et al 2011 4 3 breeding season juvenile survival long term capture recapture data from a stable population in the southeastern pine savannas of tall timbers research station in florida estimated a 100 day period survival of 0 32 95 ci 0 18 0 44 terhune et al 2019 based on mark recapture of chicks banded around 2 weeks old breeding season juvenile survival in a northern population of bobwhite estimated as a latent variable within an ipm was 0 67 95 ci 0 03 1 0 breeding season juvenile survival in southwest missouri based on radio telemetry data were lower than those previous estimates mean 0 21 95 cri 0 06 0 45 survival varied among sites and did not differ between intensively and extensively managed conservation areas juvenile survival was low relative to estimates that resulted in a stable population across all sites apart from talbot juvenile survival is sensitive to habitat suitability and availability of brood habitat may be limiting on both intensive and extensively managed sites tanner et al 2019 in southwest missouri broods selected for native grasslands that were burned and grazed on public lands as well as agricultural cover on intensively managed sites and private lands sinnott et al 2021a both native grasslands managed with fire and grazing and agricultural cover in small strip crop fields were available to broods on talbot bobwhite broods prefer habitat with bare ground forb cover and tall vegetation and survival is greatest on native grasslands managed with rotational fire and grazing taylor et al 1999a sinnott et al 2021b increasing the availability of native grasslands managed with fire and grazing and shrub cover may improve brood rearing habitat and survival on both intensively and extensively managed sites taylor et al 1999a brooke et al 2017 sinnott et al 2021ab 4 4 breeding season adult survival adult breeding season survival was slightly lower for females than for males while we did not compare survival of non reproductive incubating and brood rearing individuals risks associated with reproductive behaviors may have contributed to lower female survival burger et al 1995a other studies have found declining bobwhite populations to be sensitive to adult summer survival sandercock et al 2008 gates et al 2012 williams et al 2012 we found adult breeding season survival was not strongly correlated with population growth across our sites during the study period however survival probabilities on intensively managed sites were lower than those on extensively managed sites and lower than those that resulted in a stable population breeding season adult survival on these sites may increase with increased availability of grasslands and reduced use of forested areas taylor et al 1999b lohr et al 2011 4 5 non breeding season survival previous field simulation and meta analysis studies have found non breeding season survival contributes disproportionately to abundance trends especially for northern populations of bobwhite folk et al 2007 sandercock et al 2008 link et al 2008 williams et al 2012 rosenblatt et al 2021 we found across all sites except for talbot higher non breeding season survival was required to achieve population stability bobwhite face multiple pressures during the non breeding season population density covey dynamics and landscape composition influence non breeding season survival patterns in winter bobwhite benefit from grassland landscapes that provide permanent cover with ample shrubby vegetation williams et al 2000 lohr et al 2011 janke and gates 2013 janke et al 2015 mosloff et al 2021 thus we expected winter survival to be highest on our native grassland sites however we found survival was highest on an intensively managed site talbot followed by our largest extensively managed site wah kon tah prairie these sites are among the largest conservation areas in our study talbot has more woody cover than other sites bobwhite select for woody cover in winter and it may increase survival janke et al 2015 mosloff et al 2021 wah kon tah prairie is larger than the other two extensively managed sites has proportionately more woody cover than shelton memorial and half of the site is closed to hunting non breeding season survival was lowest at the smallest conservation areas stony point prairie and shelton memorial small coveys especially in low density populations experience reduced winter survival if they remain isolated or must make large movements to find additional members williams et al 2003a williams et al 2003b williams et al 2000 janke and gates 2013 evaluating effects of area sensitivity density dependence and effects of vegetation weather and harvest pressure was beyond the scope of this study but one or more of these factors may have contributed to site level patterns in non breeding season survival guthery et al 2000 williams et al 2000 williams et al 2003b janke et al 2015 our results would also benefit from further evaluation of survival during transitional periods between the non breeding and breeding seasons greater sage grouse experience reduced survival during these transitional periods between mid winter and summer breeding seasons due to increased depredation blomberg et al 2013a blomberg et al 2013b we do not yet know if non breeding season survival probabilities are driven by winter processes 1 december 28 february or changes during spring 1 march 30 april when coveys break up and individuals establish territories achieving greater minimum non breeding season survival would improve population viability 4 6 unmeasured demographic processes and other model uncertainties a scaling parameter within our ipm quantified unmeasured demographic processes and improved accuracy of demographic rate estimation by accounting for differences in observed abundances and projected abundances based on vital rates robinson et al 2014 riecke et al 2019 we assumed a constant rate for this scaling parameter due to limitations in our count data that prevented estimation of variation across sites and years this may be a reasonable assumption as other studies have found scaling parameters among several species show low annual variation and there is evidence of consistent bias in telemetry based estimates of bobwhite survival guthery and lusk 2004 robinson et al 2014 the scaling parameter revealed significant differences between estimated demographic rates and changes in population size 0 53 95 cri 0 46 0 60 without the scaling parameter demographic rates informed by the least data juvenile breeding season survival and non breeding season survival were estimated high relative to estimates from independent submodels additionally the correlation between these rates and annual changes in abundance was only credible without the scaling parameter our understanding of full annual cycle dynamics for bobwhite was significantly affected by variation in available data and parameterization of the model this difference between observed population changes and estimated demographic rates may be partly explained by immigration while bobwhite populations are relatively sedentary individuals can disperse distances 5 km within a season and declining bobwhite populations may rely on immigration for long term persistence lohr et al 2011 movements to and from populations are difficult to quantify and may be measured directly through intensive marking and monitoring of new recruits or collecting genetic information millon et al 2019 this difference quantified by the scaling parameter may also be explained by violations of model assumptions an assumption in radiotelemetry methodology is survival and reproduction of radio marked individuals are observed perfectly and these rates are equal to that of unmarked individuals however this may not always be true body et al 2017 several studies have suggested telemetry based estimates of adult bobwhite survival may be biased low cox et al 2004 guthery and lusk 2004 sandercock et al 2008 barron et al 2010 although this may not be universal across studies palmer and wellendorf 2007 and has not been evaluated for telemetry based estimates of juvenile survival we also assumed perfect detection of nests of radio marked adults during the breeding season if all nests were not detected by technicians fecundity estimates may be biased low finally we assumed daily survival rates were constant within the breeding and the non breeding season and discounting any within season temporal trends may bias period survival estimates derived from exponentiated daily survival rates weiser 2021 without additional genetic or capture recapture data we are unable to separate contributions of immigration and potential biases associated with demographic data contributing to the scaling parameter within our ipm we recommend integrating additional data types to better quantify immigration and designing telemetry analyses within a multistate framework to account for imperfect observations of survival and fecundity for reduced potential bias devineau et al 2014 millon et al 2019 weegman et al 2021 5 conclusions our study was constrained by the number of sites and years for which we could estimate demography because of the large field effort required to measure these parameters other site level attributes such as study area size and landscape context were to some extent confounded with management strategy and difficult to tease apart because of limited replication the limited number of sites and years the lack of environmental covariates as well as bobwhite s highly variable demography may have contributed to wide credible intervals in site specific demographic estimates despite these limitations we found multiple low seasonal vital rates resulted in annual declines in bobwhite abundance fine scale habitat management practices such as establishment of food plots field borders and woody strips applied on intensively managed sites may not optimize habitat for nesting and adult breeding season survival we encourage further research into environmental factors influencing these seasonal vital rates we also encourage future studies to cautiously interpret latent demographic parameters and potential sources of bias that may influence those estimates credit authorship contribution statement emily a sinnott conceptualization software formal analysis investigation data curation writing

24309,reclaimed water used for lake recharge can bring a variety of pollutants such as phthalic acid esters paes into the lake and thus pose a potential threat to aquatic ecosystems in this study the fates of the 4 paes dimethyl phthalate dmp diethyl phthalate dep di n butyl phthalate dbp and di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp in a lake recharged by reclaimed water were simulated using the qwasi model results showed that atmospheric input was the main source of dmp 72 97 and dehp 87 64 and reclaimed water replenishment was the main source of dep 81 02 and dbp 82 53 in the lake in the lake system most of dmp 85 45 dep 68 40 and dbp 51 58 distributed in water while most of dehp 75 43 were in sediment the hazard quotient hq calculating results showed that dbp in sediment 0 27 posed a low ecological risk and dehp in water 4 84 and sediment 1 03 posed medium ecological risks then the risk control strategies of dbp and dehp were proposed through multi scenario simulation of 4 schemes and mathematical fitting between controllable source factors and hazard quotients the risk of dbp in the lake could be effectively reduced by decreasing its level in reclaimed water for the reduction of dehp risk it is necessary to combine the optimization of reclaimed water recharge with air source control this study also provides a method for quantitative management of comprehensive ecological risk

ecological risk assessment and control data availability the website of qwasi software was provided in the paper and the data was provided in the supplementary material 1 introduction with serious water shortage reclaimed water has become an important source of lake or river recharge ao et al 2018 li et al 2019a however due to the complexity of raw municipal wastewater composition and the limited capacity of wastewater treatment plants wwtps a large number of organic chemicals still exist even in secondary and tertiary effluent used as reclaimed water chaturvedi et al 2021 deng et al 2019 sun et al 2021 they can enter the receiving water body in the process of lake or river replenishment and migrate among various environmental media thus posing a threat to the aquatic ecosystem li et al 2019b lin et al 2020 ma et al 2018 sun et al 2013 wang et al 2020 among these pollutants phthalic acid esters paes have been found to be widely present in reclaimed water and surface water environment ai et al 2021 gao et al 2014 metcalfe et al 2022 roslev et al 2007 zheng et al 2019 which can cause a variety of harmful effects on aquatic organisms including neurotoxic effects on zebrafish embryos and negative effects on the growth and development of algae caused by inhibiting photosynthesis gu et al 2017 pu et al 2020 xu et al 2013a therefore it is necessary to evaluate the ecological risks of these organic chemicals such as paes in the receiving water environment and put forward the corresponding risk control scheme however until now most of the studies on the ecological risk caused by environmental pollutants have mainly focused on risk evaluation but ignored the development of quantitative risk control methods which therefore cannot provide adequate guidance for the practical risk management of these chemicals and the scientific reuse of reclaimed water this is largely because the mathematical relationship between the concentration of chemicals in reclaimed water and their risk to the ecosystem of receiving water environment has not been established on the other hand for the simultaneous risk control of multiple pollutants in reclaimed water some schemes such as reducing reclaimed water supply may reduce the risk of some pollutants but increase the risk of other pollutants which is due to that the transports and fates of many chemicals even those of the same class such as paes entering the water environment are quite different depending on the comprehensive effects of their physicochemical properties and environmental conditions cousins et al 2003 liu et al 2016 in this study we propose a multi media model to address this problem multimedia models are regarded as useful tools to understand the behavior of contaminants in the environment by applying mathematical expressions domínguez morueco et al 2016 huang et al 2019 lu et al 2016 as a typical multimedia model the fugacity based quantitative water air sediment interaction qwasi model is designed for lakes to describe the transports and fates of chemicals among three different environmental media atmosphere lake water and lake sediment mackay and diamond 1989 mackay et al 1983 and it has been validated to be a reliable multimedia model and widely used diamond et al 2000 kim et al 2017 ling et al 1993 liu et al 2017 liu et al 2019 mackay et al 2014 woodfine et al 2000 therefore based on the qwasi model we established the mathematical relationship between the risk of paes and controllable factors to provide quantitative risk control strategies the aim of this study was to 1 determine the transfer processes of paes in a lake recharged by reclaimed water to understand the sources and fates of paes and 2 propose quantitative risk control strategies of paes through multi scenario simulation and this study is intended to help provide quantitative guidance for the ecological protection of the water environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents six priority paes were selected as target chemicals including dimethyl phthalate dmp diethyl phthalate dep di n butyl phthalate dbp benzyl butyl phthalate bbp di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp and di n octyl phthalate dnop single and mixed standard solutions of the 6 paes at 1000 mg l in n hexane were purchased from accustandard connecticut usa dichloromethane pesticide grade n hexane pesticide grade and methanol chromatography grade were purchased from anpel laboratory technologies shanghai china to prevent the samples from contamination the use of plastic products was avoided during sampling and pretreatment all the glassware was soaked in a k2cro4 h2so4 solution for 24 h cleaned with ultrapure water millipore molsheim france baked at 450 c for 4 h and rinsed with n hexane prior to use glass fiber membranes navigator tianjin china wrapped in aluminum foil were heated at 400 c for 4 h prior to use 2 2 study area the area for this study is a lake located in sino singapore tianjin eco city in china 38 40 39 00 n 117 20 118 00 e the surface water area of the lake is 1 06 106 m2 and the average water depth is 2 0 m reclaimed water from the secondary effluent of a nearby wwtp is the only source for lake recharge and monthly monitoring recharge quantity of reclaimed water is provided in table s1 2 3 sampling and pretreatment according to the geographical environment and flow characteristic of the lake a total of nine sampling points were set in the study area including eight points for lake water and sediment and one point for reclaimed water at the recharging inlet of the lake samples were collected in november 2020 december 2020 april 2021 and july 2021 respectively water samples were collected in pre cleaned brown glass bottles then filtered by 0 45 μm glass fiber filter and afterwards the filtered 1 0 l water sample was stored at 4 c sediment samples were collected using a stainless grab then placed in aluminum foil envelopes and stored at 20 c the water sample pretreatment procedure adopted the previously established solid phase extraction spe method wang et al 2021 and the method adopted for the sediment sample pretreatment referred to zhang et al 2018 with slight modification the freeze dried sediment samples were ground and sieved through a 100 mesh stainless steel sieve 2 0 g dry sediment sample was mixed with 5 0 ml dichloromethane dcm the mixture was ultrasonically extracted for 10 min and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min above two steps were repeated three times and then the combined supernatant was purified by florisil spe cartridge anpel shanghai china then 8 0 ml dcm was used to elute cartridges at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min the eluent was condensed at 0 5 ml with nitrogen finally the volume was normalized to 1 0 ml with n hexane for gas chromatography mass spectrometer gc ms analysis 2 4 gc ms analysis quality control and quality assurance paes in samples were analyzed by gcms tq8040 shimadzu japan with a db 5ms capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm agilent mass spectrum was acquired in electron impact ei mode at 70 ev and selected ion monitoring sim mode the specific parameter settings were detailed in our previous work wang et al 2021 a set of paes standard curves was established before testing each batch of samples which were prepared by diluting the original paes standard solution to different concentrations with n hexane the procedural blank duplicate sample and spiked sample were designed to ensure the accuracy of the experiment the precision was estimated by the relative standard deviation rsd of 5 parallel water or sediment samples for 6 paes were less than 10 table s2 before paes extraction paes mixed standard material 0 1 μg l for water 0 05 µg g for sediment was added to 1 l water sample and 2 g sediment sample for calculating the recoveries of paes the mean recoveries of 6 paes were 86 5 103 1 for water samples and 91 0 100 2 for sediment samples table s2 the limit of detection lod for water and sediment was calculated by three times the standard deviation n 10 of the actual concentrations of paes in the water or sediment blank sample and the loq was obtained by three times of the lod nagorka and koschorreck 2020 for paes not detected in the blank their lods and loqs were defined as the concentration that yielded a signal to noise ratio of 3 1 and 10 1 respectively the loqs of the six paes in water samples were in the range of 0 002 0 041 μg l and in sediment samples ranged from 0 001 to 0 007 μg g dw table s2 in all water and sediment samples only four paes i e dmp dep dbp and dehp were detected which were used for further modeling 2 5 qwasi model the qwasi model addressed here is a steady state level iii fugacity model to simulate the transport and fates of paes in the lake which is available as free software on the canadian environmental modelling centre cemc website https www trentu ca cemc briefly the model is based on mass balance equations v z df dt 0 for the air water and sediment compartments where v m3 represents the volume of each compartment z mol m3 pa is the fugacity capacity mackay and paterson 1991 and f fugacity pa a thermodynamic property and a criterion of equilibrium for mass diffusion between compartments such as air and water is linearly related to concentration c mol m3 i e c z f in the model developed in this study paes flowed into the lake through the reclaimed water recharge and atmospheric input dry and wet aerosol deposition rain dissolution absorption and out of the lake through volatilization water outflow degradation reaction in water and sediment and sediment burial the lake temperature was assumed to be 25 c which was close to the average annual measured temperature of lake water the concentration mass distribution residence time fugacity and transfer flux of paes in the lake system can be obtained by the mass balance equations embedded in the microsoft excel spreadsheet based on the input of physicochemical properties environmental properties and the emission data physicochemical properties of the 4 paes environmental properties and emission concentrations of paes required by the model are presented in table s3 and table s4 respectively the annual average concentration of paes in reclaimed water and its annual average reclaimed water quantity are used as the input data of the model the background concentration of paes in the air adopted the results of ji et al 2014 water outflow was calculated based on water balance of the rainfall evaporation water inflow and outflow and the data of annual average rainfall and evaporation were obtained from china meteorological data sharing service network http cdc nmic cn home do as shown in table s5 several parameters referred to typical values such as density mass transfer coefficient and so on mackay et al 2015 mackay et al 2014 2 6 ecological risk assessment the hazard quotient hq is the most commonly used method of ecological risk assessment because of its simplicity and effectiveness ai et al 2021 le et al 2022 li et al 2017 sun et al 2021 wang et al 2022 it was used in this study to evaluate the ecological risk of paes in the lake the hq value of the lake system is calculated as the sum of hqs for lake water and sediment hq values were calculated as the ratio of the exposure concentration ec and the predicted no effect concentration pnec of pollutants as shown in eq 1 1 hq ec pnec in this study the ec of the paes used for hq calculation was the qwasi model predicted concentration of paes in the lake water μg l and sediment μg g dw we acquired the following values of pnec for the water and sediment phases from gao et al 2019 dmp 618 μg l dep 38 μg l dbp 3 μg l dehp 0 05 μg l in water and dmp 1 02 μg g dep 0 09 μg g dbp 0 09 μg g dehp 0 10 μg g in sediment the ecological risk was classified into 4 levels according to hq value hq 0 1 no risk 0 1 hq 1 0 low risk 1 0 hq 10 moderate risk and hq 10 high risk gao et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 model validation the annual mean measured concentrations of paes in the lake water and sediment table s6 were compared with simulated values for model validation as shown in fig 1 the deviations between measured and simulated results of dmp dep dbp dehp were 0 11 0 47 0 24 0 54 log units for the lake water and 0 43 0 54 0 33 0 26 log units for the sediment respectively it is acceptable that the deviation between simulated and measured result is less than 1 0 orders of magnitude for a multimedia fugacity model du et al 2020 xu et al 2013b these differences were probably caused by the following factors 1 the uncertainty of model parameters such as k oc half lives and paes monitoring data in the air which were taken from literature not actual measurement besides the assumption of steady state annual temperature of 25 c derived from the mean daytime measurements could skew these parameters away from actual situation resulting in overestimates of pae volatile fluxes to the atmosphere 2 the simulation results represent the average level of the whole study area while the measured mean values were taken from limited sampling sites 3 the aquatic biota is ignored to simplify the model which is common in multimedia models because they rarely accumulate an appreciable fraction of the total solute mass mackay et al 1983 and 4 some uncertain factors e g the effects of strong winds and storms causing resuspension of sediment in this shallow lake which might lead to pulses of increase in paes concentration in the water above the simulated mean concentration and some bottom feeding fish stirring up the sediment during feeding could also cause sediment resuspension these are considered limitations of the qwasi modeling nevertheless this model meets the accuracy requirements and gives adequate information for risk assessment thus providing reliable guidance for the development of control strategies for these chemicals 3 2 transport and fate of paes the pae original simulation results in the lake are presented in the form of a mass balance diagram supplementary materials which shows great differences among the 4 paes three of the paes were mainly distributed in the lake water dmp in water 0 313 kg and in sediment 0 053 kg dep in water 0 081 kg and in sediment 0 038 kg and dbp in water 0 394 kg and in sediment 0 370 kg dehp mainly existed in the sediment in water 0 515 kg and in sediment 1 581 kg fig 2 a this is probably because that octanol water partition coefficient k ow of dehp is 3 46 6 12 orders of magnitude higher than that of other three paes which means dehp is more hydrophobic and easier to be assigned to the sediment the residence time of paes obtained by qwasi software is assessed by steady state chemical mass in each phase system and its loss rates kim et al 2017 whelan 2013 as shown in fig 2b the residence times in the lake water were shorter than those in sediment due to high loss rates via transformation in water and outflow dmp in water 11 5 d in sediment 179 0 d and in lake system 13 3 d dep in water 11 5 d in sediment 179 0 d and in lake system 16 3 d dbp in water 11 4 d in sediment 326 1 d and in lake system 21 4 d and dehp in water 15 8 d in sediment 500 3 d and in lake system 58 6 d fig 2c in addition compared with dehp the residence time of dmp dep and dbp in the lake system was close to that in lake water reflecting most of them are predicted to be in water the transfer fluxes of paes in and out of the lake system obtained by qwasi fugacity model are shown in fig 2c atmospheric input t12 and reclaimed water recharge t02t were two pathways for paes into the lake among them 72 97 of dmp and 87 64 of dehp in the lake came from atmospheric input while 81 02 of dep and 82 53 of dbp were from the recharge of reclaimed water for the removal of pae in the lake degradation reaction in water t20m and outflow t20t were found to be the most important loss mechanisms of paes in the lake ranging from 69 31 dehp to 98 87 dmp in addition volatilization t21d also played an indispensable role in the removal of dehp from the lake it accounted for 21 87 of dehp total loss flux the removal of paes via sediment burial t40b was negligible 0 2 3 3 ecological risk assessment of paes in the lake the ecological risks of paes in lake water sediment and lake system are shown in fig 3 the hq values for the four paes in the water and sediment of the lake both followed the order dehp dbp dep dmp which were also found in other studies chen et al 2019 li et al 2016a li et al 2016b the hqs of dmp and dep in the lake system were all lower than 0 1 suggesting no risk to aquatic organisms in the lake the hq of dbp in water 0 06 also showed no risk while its hq in sediment 0 27 reached a low risk level the hq values of dehp in water 4 84 and in sediment 1 03 are showing moderate risks which contributes 94 07 of the total ecological risk 6 24 of the four paes in the lake 3 4 ecological risk control strategies of paes according to the risk assessment results dbp and dehp were the key risk control objectives in order to provide quantitative guidance for their risk control multi scenario simulation under different emission strategies were carried out using qwasi model the concentrations of paes in reclaimed water and air and the flow rate of reclaimed water were considered as key controllable factors for risk reduction and thus four schemes were proposed as follows scheme 1 dbp or dehp concentrations in reclaimed water crw μg l as the only variable parameter were set to a series of different values for simulation so as to obtain the hq values of the chemicals in the lake water sediment and lake system fig 4 the relationship between crw and the corresponding hq in lake water sediment and lake system was fitted well with linear equations table 1 the slope is called risk coefficient here reflecting the influence of dbp or dehp concentration in the reclaimed water on its risk to the lake ecosystem and the constant term represents the minimum value of hq which was entirely caused by dbp or dehp in air if the dbp or dehp concentration in the reclaimed water was 0 μg l according to the multi scenario simulation results dbp would not pose ecological risk to sensitive aquatic organisms in the lake water and sediment when its concentration in reclaimed water was in the range of 0 0 730 μg l and 0 0 101 μg l respectively and considering the total risk of dbp in the lake system its safe concentration no risk to lake system in reclaimed water is 0 065 μg l much lower than the actual dbp concentration in the reclaimed water 0 419 μg l however the risk coefficients of dehp were 9 505 for the lake water and 2 026 for the sediment respectively which were significantly higher than those of dbp 0 122 for lake water and 0 527 for sediment indicating that dehp risk reduction was more effective than dbp through reclaimed water concentration control but the minimum hq of dehp in the lake system was 5 150 which was still at a medium level of ecological risk suggesting that the atmospheric input was an important source for dehp in the lake scheme 2 dbp or dehp concentrations in the air cair μg m3 as the only control factor were set to several different values for simulation so as to obtain their hq in the lake water sediment and lake system fig 5 linear fitting results are listed in table 1 risk coefficient of dehp in lake water 67 389 in sediment 14 363 in lake system 81 752 was much higher than that of dbp in lake water 0 196 in sediment 0 850 in lake system 1 046 suggesting that the risk of dehp in the lake could be quickly reduced through decreasing dehp concentration in the air the constant terms of dbp and dehp in the lake system were 0 272 and 0 726 respectively representing this is the risk only caused by reclaimed water recharge when their concentrations in the air were set to 0 μg m3 scheme 3 in view of the limited risk control effect of the above two schemes scheme 3 attempted to control the concentrations of dbp or dehp in both reclaimed water and air at the same time which were taken as independent variables and set to different values to obtain the corresponding hq values as shown in fig 6 the multiple linear regressions between them are presented in table 1 the risk of dbp in the lake was significantly affected by cdbp rw but slightly affected by cdbp air as shown in fig 6a indicating that recharging water quality improvement is more effective in reducing dbp risk than air source control however the risk of dehp in the lake was strongly influenced by its concentration in both reclaimed water and air fig 6b reflecting the different sources and fates of the two phthalates scheme 4 the flow rate of reclaimed water q m3 h was considered as the only controllable factor and successively set to a series of values in the range of 200 8 000 m3 h on the basis of water balance of the lake and accordingly the hq values of dbp or dehp were obtained fig 7 a and b the relationship between q and corresponding hq of dbp or dehp in the lake water sediment and lake system was fitted well in the logistic model table 1 according to the fitting results the hq of dbp in the lake water sediment and lake system increased with the increase of water inflow on account of the higher dbp concentration in reclaimed water 0 419 μg l than its steady state concentration 0 185 μg l in the lake water however dehp showed the opposite trend due to that the concentration of dehp in reclaimed water 0 063 μg l was lower than its steady state concentration 0 242 μg l in the water body of the lake this is in accordance with fig 2c that the main sources of dbp and dehp in the lake were reclaimed water recharge and air to water transfer respectively in addition the constant terms of dbp fitting equations in the lake water 0 140 sediment 0 606 and lake system 0 746 reflect its maximum hq when the water inflow tends to be infinite q and the dbp concentration in the lake water would be equal to its level in reclaimed water at this time besides dbp in lake water and sediment would not pose ecological risk when the water inflow was lower than 10 567 533 m3 h and 261 964 m3 h respectively the safe reclaimed water inflow for dbp risk control of the lake system was 71 014 m3 h which was less than the minimum inflow based on water balance and difficult to be applied in practice however the constant terms of dehp fitting results respectively reflect the minimum of dehp in the lake water 1 260 sediment 0 269 and lake system 1 529 suggesting that dehp could not reach the no risk level through water inflow control alone from the perspective of total risk control the total risk of four paes in the lake water 4hqw sediment 4hqs and lake system 4hqw s under different water inflow quantity is shown in fig 7c with the hq for each pae in the lake system shown in fig 7d and logistic fitting equations are presented in table 1 the risk variation trends of paes were different with the increase of water inflow fig 7d which is true for risk control of multiple chemicals in lake systems under the superposition of risk changes especially dehp 4hqw 4hqs and 4hqw s decreased slightly with the increase of water quantity fig 7c so the effect of risk reduction by adjusting reclaimed water quantity would be very limited which is not recommended as discussed above decreasing the concentration of dbp and dehp in reclaimed water is effective on the risk reduction and should be applied as the main risk control approach in practical application improving the process of wwtp is suggested to reduce the concentration of paes mainly dbp and dehp under the comprehensive balance of risk control goal technical difficulty and economic cost however only improving recharging water quality is still not enough to achieve the risk control goal of dehp in the lake due to its important atmospheric source therefore it is suggested to combine original source management and total amount control to reduce the consumption and environmental emission flux of dehp so as to reduce the input of dehp to the lake through air water transfer and reclaimed water replenishment from the perspective of risk control chemicals in lake systems that enter the lake only through reclaimed water recharging and atmospheric input can be divided into four categories 1 no risk or low risk chemicals which can be ignored 2 chemicals such as dbp whose risks can be effectively reduced solely by decreasing their levels in recharging water source 3 chemicals whose risks can be effectively reduced solely by air source control 4 chemicals such as dehp whose risks need to be reduced through the combination of recharging water quality improvement and air source control analysis of multiple scenarios for controlling chemical sources to the lake can provide decision making support for quantitative risk control such analysis can identify the risk categories for the different chemicals guidance for the most effective areas for source control can be found by developing direct mathematical relationships between controllable factors and hqs of chemicals for multiple scenarios 4 conclusions in this study we developed an ecological risk assessment and control conceptual framework for multiple phthalates in a lake using multimedia model qwasi the main conclusions are as follows atmospheric input was the main source of dmp 72 97 and dehp 87 64 in the lake and reclaimed water recharge was the main source of dep 81 02 and dbp 82 53 in the lake dmp 85 45 dep 68 40 and dbp 51 58 mostly concentrated in the water while most of dehp 75 43 concentrated in the sediment the risk level for dbp in the sediment was low dehp in the lake water and sediment posed moderate risks which should be the focal objectives for risk control decreasing pae level in reclaimed water could effectively reduce dbp risk in the lake but would not be enough to reduce dehp risk due to the fact that air is its major source adjusting the recharge quantity of reclaimed water had no significant effect on reducing the total risk mainly due to the opposite risk trend of dmp and dehp in the lake with dep and dbp the method presented in this study can be applied to other chemicals in lakes recharged by reclaimed water multi scenario simulation with a multi media model is necessary for providing comprehensive risk management decisions for reclaimed water recharge credit authorship contribution statement chenchen wang conceptualization methodology writing review editing resources funding

fates of the 4 paes dimethyl phthalate dmp diethyl phthalate dep di n butyl phthalate dbp and di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp in a lake recharged by reclaimed water were simulated using the qwasi model results showed that atmospheric input was the main source of dmp 72 97 and dehp 87 64 and reclaimed water replenishment was the main source of dep 81 02 and dbp 82 53 in the lake in the lake system most of dmp 85 45 dep 68 40 and dbp 51 58 distributed in water while most of dehp 75 43 were in sediment the hazard quotient hq calculating results showed that dbp in sediment 0 27 posed a low ecological risk and dehp in water 4 84 and sediment 1 03 posed medium ecological risks then the risk control strategies of dbp and dehp were proposed through multi scenario simulation of 4 schemes and mathematical fitting between controllable source factors and hazard quotients the risk of dbp in the lake could be effectively reduced by decreasing its level in reclaimed water for the reduction of dehp risk it is necessary to combine the optimization of reclaimed water recharge with air source control this study also provides a method for quantitative management of comprehensive ecological risk

water shortage reclaimed water has become an important source of lake or river recharge ao et al 2018 li et al 2019a however due to the complexity of raw municipal wastewater composition and the limited capacity of wastewater treatment plants wwtps a large number of organic chemicals still exist even in secondary and tertiary effluent used as reclaimed water chaturvedi et al 2021 deng et al 2019 sun et al 2021 they can enter the receiving water body in the process of lake or river replenishment and migrate among various environmental media thus posing a threat to the aquatic ecosystem li et al 2019b lin et al 2020 ma et al 2018 sun et al 2013 wang et al 2020 among these pollutants phthalic acid esters paes have been found to be widely present in reclaimed water and surface water environment ai et al 2021 gao et al 2014 metcalfe et al 2022 roslev et al 2007 zheng et al 2019 which can cause a variety of harmful effects on aquatic organisms including neurotoxic effects on zebrafish embryos and negative effects on the growth and development of algae caused by inhibiting photosynthesis gu et al 2017 pu et al 2020 xu et al 2013a therefore it is necessary to evaluate the ecological risks of these organic chemicals such as paes in the receiving water environment and put forward the corresponding risk control scheme however until now most of the studies on the ecological risk caused by environmental pollutants have mainly focused on risk evaluation but ignored the development of quantitative risk control methods which therefore cannot provide adequate guidance for the practical risk management of these chemicals and the scientific reuse of reclaimed water this is largely because the mathematical relationship between the concentration of chemicals in reclaimed water and their risk to the ecosystem of receiving water environment has not been established on the other hand for the simultaneous risk control of multiple pollutants in reclaimed water some schemes such as reducing reclaimed water supply may reduce the risk of some pollutants but increase the risk of other pollutants which is due to that the transports and fates of many chemicals even those of the same class such as paes entering the water environment are quite different depending on the comprehensive effects of their physicochemical properties and environmental conditions cousins et al 2003 liu et al 2016 in this study we propose a multi media model to address this problem multimedia models are regarded as useful tools to understand the behavior of contaminants in the environment by applying mathematical expressions domínguez morueco et al 2016 huang et al 2019 lu et al 2016 as a typical multimedia model the fugacity based quantitative water air sediment interaction qwasi model is designed for lakes to describe the transports and fates of chemicals among three different environmental media atmosphere lake water and lake sediment mackay and diamond 1989 mackay et al 1983 and it has been validated to be a reliable multimedia model and widely used diamond et al 2000 kim et al 2017 ling et al 1993 liu et al 2017 liu et al 2019 mackay et al 2014 woodfine et al 2000 therefore based on the qwasi model we established the mathematical relationship between the risk of paes and controllable factors to provide quantitative risk control strategies the aim of this study was to 1 determine the transfer processes of paes in a lake recharged by reclaimed water to understand the sources and fates of paes and 2 propose quantitative risk control strategies of paes through multi scenario simulation and this study is intended to help provide quantitative guidance for the ecological protection of the water environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents six priority paes were selected as target chemicals including dimethyl phthalate dmp diethyl phthalate dep di n butyl phthalate dbp benzyl butyl phthalate bbp di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp and di n octyl phthalate dnop single and mixed standard solutions of the 6 paes at 1000 mg l in n hexane were purchased from accustandard connecticut usa dichloromethane pesticide grade n hexane pesticide grade and methanol chromatography grade were purchased from anpel laboratory technologies shanghai china to prevent the samples from contamination the use of plastic products was avoided during sampling and pretreatment all the glassware was soaked in a k2cro4 h2so4 solution for 24 h cleaned with ultrapure water millipore molsheim france baked at 450 c for 4 h and rinsed with n hexane prior to use glass fiber membranes navigator tianjin china wrapped in aluminum foil were heated at 400 c for 4 h prior to use 2 2 study area the area for this study is a lake located in sino singapore tianjin eco city in china 38 40 39 00 n 117 20 118 00 e the surface water area of the lake is 1 06 106 m2 and the average water depth is 2 0 m reclaimed water from the secondary effluent of a nearby wwtp is the only source for lake recharge and monthly monitoring recharge quantity of reclaimed water is provided in table s1 2 3 sampling and pretreatment according to the geographical environment and flow characteristic of the lake a total of nine sampling points were set in the study area including eight points for lake water and sediment and one point for reclaimed water at the recharging inlet of the lake samples were collected in november 2020 december 2020 april 2021 and july 2021 respectively water samples were collected in pre cleaned brown glass bottles then filtered by 0 45 μm glass fiber filter and afterwards the filtered 1 0 l water sample was stored at 4 c sediment samples were collected using a stainless grab then placed in aluminum foil envelopes and stored at 20 c the water sample pretreatment procedure adopted the previously established solid phase extraction spe method wang et al 2021 and the method adopted for the sediment sample pretreatment referred to zhang et al 2018 with slight modification the freeze dried sediment samples were ground and sieved through a 100 mesh stainless steel sieve 2 0 g dry sediment sample was mixed with 5 0 ml dichloromethane dcm the mixture was ultrasonically extracted for 10 min and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min above two steps were repeated three times and then the combined supernatant was purified by florisil spe cartridge anpel shanghai china then 8 0 ml dcm was used to elute cartridges at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min the eluent was condensed at 0 5 ml with nitrogen finally the volume was normalized to 1 0 ml with n hexane for gas chromatography mass spectrometer gc ms analysis 2 4 gc ms analysis quality control and quality assurance paes in samples were analyzed by gcms tq8040 shimadzu japan with a db 5ms capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm agilent mass spectrum was acquired in electron impact ei mode at 70 ev and selected ion monitoring sim mode the specific parameter settings were detailed in our previous work wang et al 2021 a set of paes standard curves was established before testing each batch of samples which were prepared by diluting the original paes standard solution to different concentrations with n hexane the procedural blank duplicate sample and spiked sample were designed to ensure the accuracy of the experiment the precision was estimated by the relative standard deviation rsd of 5 parallel water or sediment samples for 6 paes were less than 10 table s2 before paes extraction paes mixed standard material 0 1 μg l for water 0 05 µg g for sediment was added to 1 l water sample and 2 g sediment sample for calculating the recoveries of paes the mean recoveries of 6 paes were 86 5 103 1 for water samples and 91 0 100 2 for sediment samples table s2 the limit of detection lod for water and sediment was calculated by three times the standard deviation n 10 of the actual concentrations of paes in the water or sediment blank sample and the loq was obtained by three times of the lod nagorka and koschorreck 2020 for paes not detected in the blank their lods and loqs were defined as the concentration that yielded a signal to noise ratio of 3 1 and 10 1 respectively the loqs of the six paes in water samples were in the range of 0 002 0 041 μg l and in sediment samples ranged from 0 001 to 0 007 μg g dw table s2 in all water and sediment samples only four paes i e dmp dep dbp and dehp were detected which were used for further modeling 2 5 qwasi model the qwasi model addressed here is a steady state level iii fugacity model to simulate the transport and fates of paes in the lake which is available as free software on the canadian environmental modelling centre cemc website https www trentu ca cemc briefly the model is based on mass balance equations v z df dt 0 for the air water and sediment compartments where v m3 represents the volume of each compartment z mol m3 pa is the fugacity capacity mackay and paterson 1991 and f fugacity pa a thermodynamic property and a criterion of equilibrium for mass diffusion between compartments such as air and water is linearly related to concentration c mol m3 i e c z f in the model developed in this study paes flowed into the lake through the reclaimed water recharge and atmospheric input dry and wet aerosol deposition rain dissolution absorption and out of the lake through volatilization water outflow degradation reaction in water and sediment and sediment burial the lake temperature was assumed to be 25 c which was close to the average annual measured temperature of lake water the concentration mass distribution residence time fugacity and transfer flux of paes in the lake system can be obtained by the mass balance equations embedded in the microsoft excel spreadsheet based on the input of physicochemical properties environmental properties and the emission data physicochemical properties of the 4 paes environmental properties and emission concentrations of paes required by the model are presented in table s3 and table s4 respectively the annual average concentration of paes in reclaimed water and its annual average reclaimed water quantity are used as the input data of the model the background concentration of paes in the air adopted the results of ji et al 2014 water outflow was calculated based on water balance of the rainfall evaporation water inflow and outflow and the data of annual average rainfall and evaporation were obtained from china meteorological data sharing service network http cdc nmic cn home do as shown in table s5 several parameters referred to typical values such as density mass transfer coefficient and so on mackay et al 2015 mackay et al 2014 2 6 ecological risk assessment the hazard quotient hq is the most commonly used method of ecological risk assessment because of its simplicity and effectiveness ai et al 2021 le et al 2022 li et al 2017 sun et al 2021 wang et al 2022 it was used in this study to evaluate the ecological risk of paes in the lake the hq value of the lake system is calculated as the sum of hqs for lake water and sediment hq values were calculated as the ratio of the exposure concentration ec and the predicted no effect concentration pnec of pollutants as shown in eq 1 1 hq ec pnec in this study the ec of the paes used for hq calculation was the qwasi model predicted concentration of paes in the lake water μg l and sediment μg g dw we acquired the following values of pnec for the water and sediment phases from gao et al 2019 dmp 618 μg l dep 38 μg l dbp 3 μg l dehp 0 05 μg l in water and dmp 1 02 μg g dep 0 09 μg g dbp 0 09 μg g dehp 0 10 μg g in sediment the ecological risk was classified into 4 levels according to hq value hq 0 1 no risk 0 1 hq 1 0 low risk 1 0 hq 10 moderate risk and hq 10 high risk gao et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 model validation the annual mean measured concentrations of paes in the lake water and sediment table s6 were compared with simulated values for model validation as shown in fig 1 the deviations between measured and simulated results of dmp dep dbp dehp were 0 11 0 47 0 24 0 54 log units for the lake water and 0 43 0 54 0 33 0 26 log units for the sediment respectively it is acceptable that the deviation between simulated and measured result is less than 1 0 orders of magnitude for a multimedia fugacity model du et al 2020 xu et al 2013b these differences were probably caused by the following factors 1 the uncertainty of model parameters such as k oc half lives and paes monitoring data in the air which were taken from literature not actual measurement besides the assumption of steady state annual temperature of 25 c derived from the mean daytime measurements could skew these parameters away from actual situation resulting in overestimates of pae volatile fluxes to the atmosphere 2 the simulation results represent the average level of the whole study area while the measured mean values were taken from limited sampling sites 3 the aquatic biota is ignored to simplify the model which is common in multimedia models because they rarely accumulate an appreciable fraction of the total solute mass mackay et al 1983 and 4 some uncertain factors e g the effects of strong winds and storms causing resuspension of sediment in this shallow lake which might lead to pulses of increase in paes concentration in the water above the simulated mean concentration and some bottom feeding fish stirring up the sediment during feeding could also cause sediment resuspension these are considered limitations of the qwasi modeling nevertheless this model meets the accuracy requirements and gives adequate information for risk assessment thus providing reliable guidance for the development of control strategies for these chemicals 3 2 transport and fate of paes the pae original simulation results in the lake are presented in the form of a mass balance diagram supplementary materials which shows great differences among the 4 paes three of the paes were mainly distributed in the lake water dmp in water 0 313 kg and in sediment 0 053 kg dep in water 0 081 kg and in sediment 0 038 kg and dbp in water 0 394 kg and in sediment 0 370 kg dehp mainly existed in the sediment in water 0 515 kg and in sediment 1 581 kg fig 2 a this is probably because that octanol water partition coefficient k ow of dehp is 3 46 6 12 orders of magnitude higher than that of other three paes which means dehp is more hydrophobic and easier to be assigned to the sediment the residence time of paes obtained by qwasi software is assessed by steady state chemical mass in each phase system and its loss rates kim et al 2017 whelan 2013 as shown in fig 2b the residence times in the lake water were shorter than those in sediment due to high loss rates via transformation in water and outflow dmp in water 11 5 d in sediment 179 0 d and in lake system 13 3 d dep in water 11 5 d in sediment 179 0 d and in lake system 16 3 d dbp in water 11 4 d in sediment 326 1 d and in lake system 21 4 d and dehp in water 15 8 d in sediment 500 3 d and in lake system 58 6 d fig 2c in addition compared with dehp the residence time of dmp dep and dbp in the lake system was close to that in lake water reflecting most of them are predicted to be in water the transfer fluxes of paes in and out of the lake system obtained by qwasi fugacity model are shown in fig 2c atmospheric input t12 and reclaimed water recharge t02t were two pathways for paes into the lake among them 72 97 of dmp and 87 64 of dehp in the lake came from atmospheric input while 81 02 of dep and 82 53 of dbp were from the recharge of reclaimed water for the removal of pae in the lake degradation reaction in water t20m and outflow t20t were found to be the most important loss mechanisms of paes in the lake ranging from 69 31 dehp to 98 87 dmp in addition volatilization t21d also played an indispensable role in the removal of dehp from the lake it accounted for 21 87 of dehp total loss flux the removal of paes via sediment burial t40b was negligible 0 2 3 3 ecological risk assessment of paes in the lake the ecological risks of paes in lake water sediment and lake system are shown in fig 3 the hq values for the four paes in the water and sediment of the lake both followed the order dehp dbp dep dmp which were also found in other studies chen et al 2019 li et al 2016a li et al 2016b the hqs of dmp and dep in the lake system were all lower than 0 1 suggesting no risk to aquatic organisms in the lake the hq of dbp in water 0 06 also showed no risk while its hq in sediment 0 27 reached a low risk level the hq values of dehp in water 4 84 and in sediment 1 03 are showing moderate risks which contributes 94 07 of the total ecological risk 6 24 of the four paes in the lake 3 4 ecological risk control strategies of paes according to the risk assessment results dbp and dehp were the key risk control objectives in order to provide quantitative guidance for their risk control multi scenario simulation under different emission strategies were carried out using qwasi model the concentrations of paes in reclaimed water and air and the flow rate of reclaimed water were considered as key controllable factors for risk reduction and thus four schemes were proposed as follows scheme 1 dbp or dehp concentrations in reclaimed water crw μg l as the only variable parameter were set to a series of different values for simulation so as to obtain the hq values of the chemicals in the lake water sediment and lake system fig 4 the relationship between crw and the corresponding hq in lake water sediment and lake system was fitted well with linear equations table 1 the slope is called risk coefficient here reflecting the influence of dbp or dehp concentration in the reclaimed water on its risk to the lake ecosystem and the constant term represents the minimum value of hq which was entirely caused by dbp or dehp in air if the dbp or dehp concentration in the reclaimed water was 0 μg l according to the multi scenario simulation results dbp would not pose ecological risk to sensitive aquatic organisms in the lake water and sediment when its concentration in reclaimed water was in the range of 0 0 730 μg l and 0 0 101 μg l respectively and considering the total risk of dbp in the lake system its safe concentration no risk to lake system in reclaimed water is 0 065 μg l much lower than the actual dbp concentration in the reclaimed water 0 419 μg l however the risk coefficients of dehp were 9 505 for the lake water and 2 026 for the sediment respectively which were significantly higher than those of dbp 0 122 for lake water and 0 527 for sediment indicating that dehp risk reduction was more effective than dbp through reclaimed water concentration control but the minimum hq of dehp in the lake system was 5 150 which was still at a medium level of ecological risk suggesting that the atmospheric input was an important source for dehp in the lake scheme 2 dbp or dehp concentrations in the air cair μg m3 as the only control factor were set to several different values for simulation so as to obtain their hq in the lake water sediment and lake system fig 5 linear fitting results are listed in table 1 risk coefficient of dehp in lake water 67 389 in sediment 14 363 in lake system 81 752 was much higher than that of dbp in lake water 0 196 in sediment 0 850 in lake system 1 046 suggesting that the risk of dehp in the lake could be quickly reduced through decreasing dehp concentration in the air the constant terms of dbp and dehp in the lake system were 0 272 and 0 726 respectively representing this is the risk only caused by reclaimed water recharge when their concentrations in the air were set to 0 μg m3 scheme 3 in view of the limited risk control effect of the above two schemes scheme 3 attempted to control the concentrations of dbp or dehp in both reclaimed water and air at the same time which were taken as independent variables and set to different values to obtain the corresponding hq values as shown in fig 6 the multiple linear regressions between them are presented in table 1 the risk of dbp in the lake was significantly affected by cdbp rw but slightly affected by cdbp air as shown in fig 6a indicating that recharging water quality improvement is more effective in reducing dbp risk than air source control however the risk of dehp in the lake was strongly influenced by its concentration in both reclaimed water and air fig 6b reflecting the different sources and fates of the two phthalates scheme 4 the flow rate of reclaimed water q m3 h was considered as the only controllable factor and successively set to a series of values in the range of 200 8 000 m3 h on the basis of water balance of the lake and accordingly the hq values of dbp or dehp were obtained fig 7 a and b the relationship between q and corresponding hq of dbp or dehp in the lake water sediment and lake system was fitted well in the logistic model table 1 according to the fitting results the hq of dbp in the lake water sediment and lake system increased with the increase of water inflow on account of the higher dbp concentration in reclaimed water 0 419 μg l than its steady state concentration 0 185 μg l in the lake water however dehp showed the opposite trend due to that the concentration of dehp in reclaimed water 0 063 μg l was lower than its steady state concentration 0 242 μg l in the water body of the lake this is in accordance with fig 2c that the main sources of dbp and dehp in the lake were reclaimed water recharge and air to water transfer respectively in addition the constant terms of dbp fitting equations in the lake water 0 140 sediment 0 606 and lake system 0 746 reflect its maximum hq when the water inflow tends to be infinite q and the dbp concentration in the lake water would be equal to its level in reclaimed water at this time besides dbp in lake water and sediment would not pose ecological risk when the water inflow was lower than 10 567 533 m3 h and 261 964 m3 h respectively the safe reclaimed water inflow for dbp risk control of the lake system was 71 014 m3 h which was less than the minimum inflow based on water balance and difficult to be applied in practice however the constant terms of dehp fitting results respectively reflect the minimum of dehp in the lake water 1 260 sediment 0 269 and lake system 1 529 suggesting that dehp could not reach the no risk level through water inflow control alone from the perspective of total risk control the total risk of four paes in the lake water 4hqw sediment 4hqs and lake system 4hqw s under different water inflow quantity is shown in fig 7c with the hq for each pae in the lake system shown in fig 7d and logistic fitting equations are presented in table 1 the risk variation trends of paes were different with the increase of water inflow fig 7d which is true for risk control of multiple chemicals in lake systems under the superposition of risk changes especially dehp 4hqw 4hqs and 4hqw s decreased slightly with the increase of water quantity fig 7c so the effect of risk reduction by adjusting reclaimed water quantity would be very limited which is not recommended as discussed above decreasing the concentration of dbp and dehp in reclaimed water is effective on the risk reduction and should be applied as the main risk control approach in practical application improving the process of wwtp is suggested to reduce the concentration of paes mainly dbp and dehp under the comprehensive balance of risk control goal technical difficulty and economic cost however only improving recharging water quality is still not enough to achieve the risk control goal of dehp in the lake due to its important atmospheric source therefore it is suggested to combine original source management and total amount control to reduce the consumption and environmental emission flux of dehp so as to reduce the input of dehp to the lake through air water transfer and reclaimed water replenishment from the perspective of risk control chemicals in lake systems that enter the lake only through reclaimed water recharging and atmospheric input can be divided into four categories 1 no risk or low risk chemicals which can be ignored 2 chemicals such as dbp whose risks can be effectively reduced solely by decreasing their levels in recharging water source 3 chemicals whose risks can be effectively reduced solely by air source control 4 chemicals such as dehp whose risks need to be reduced through the combination of recharging water quality improvement and air source control analysis of multiple scenarios for controlling chemical sources to the lake can provide decision making support for quantitative risk control such analysis can identify the risk categories for the different chemicals guidance for the most effective areas for source control can be found by developing direct mathematical relationships between controllable factors and hqs of chemicals for multiple scenarios 4 conclusions in this study we developed an ecological risk assessment and control conceptual framework for multiple phthalates in a lake using multimedia model qwasi the main conclusions are as follows atmospheric input was the main source of dmp 72 97 and dehp 87 64 in the lake and reclaimed water recharge was the main source of dep 81 02 and dbp 82 53 in the lake dmp 85 45 dep 68 40 and dbp 51 58 mostly concentrated in the water while most of dehp 75 43 concentrated in the sediment the risk level for dbp in the sediment was low dehp in the lake water and sediment posed moderate risks which should be the focal objectives for risk control decreasing pae level in reclaimed water could effectively reduce dbp risk in the lake but would not be enough to reduce dehp risk due to the fact that air is its major source adjusting the recharge quantity of reclaimed water had no significant effect on reducing the total risk mainly due to the opposite risk trend of dmp and dehp in the lake with dep and dbp the method presented in this study can be applied to other chemicals in lakes recharged by reclaimed water multi scenario simulation with a multi media model is necessary for providing comprehensive risk management decisions for reclaimed water recharge credit authorship contribution statement chenchen wang conceptualization methodology writing review editing resources funding
