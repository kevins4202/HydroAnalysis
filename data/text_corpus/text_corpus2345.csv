metals were selected based on the dominant anthropogenic activities in the study area which include agriculture and mining practiced in previous years that contribute to soil contamination and land degradation with the consequent exposure of the environment to trace metal contamination 2 materials and methods fig 1 shows a general description of the development of the methodology 2 1 study area the san luis potosí valley is limited orographically to the north by the set of hills alto la melada to the west and south by the sierra de san miguel and to the east by the sierra de álvarez fig 2 the study area has a temperate climate with a warm semi arid summer the mean annual precipitation is 402 6 mm the mean annual temperature is 17 5 c and the mean annual evaporation of 2038 7 mm the aquifer system is part of the el salado hydrological basin in the center of this hydrological basin is the metropolitan area of the municipalities of san luis potosí and soledad de graciano sanchez which for their different uses depends on the supply of groundwater 95 percent lópez álvarez et al 2013 the study area fig 2 located in the mexican highlands specifically in the physiographic region mesa del centro is considered one of the semi arid regions of mexico during the second half of the 20th century in the central area of san luis potosí mexico industrial activity grew exponentially causing urban growth and expansion lópez álvarez 2012 as well as the increase in the demand for water for domestic and industrial uses and mainly the continuous generation of wastewater the wastewater drainage of the city of san luis potosí is carried out through a combined system that mixes industrial and municipal wastewater with rainwater the wastewater from the industrial area contains high concentrations of organic pollutants and heavy metals and the final discharge point is the wastewater treatment plant tanque tenorio and then is channeled to the agricultural area for crop irrigation carranza álvarez et al 2008 this study aims through an analysis of the hydrogeochemical processes present in the shallow aquifer located in the central area of san luis potosí mexico to establish the degree of contamination associated with the type of land use and the anthropogenic activities present in the study area fuentes rivas et al 2020 2 2 groundwater chemical and quality the chemical analysis of groundwater is decisive to establish its quality since it depends on various parameters such as geology geomorphology and industrial urban and agricultural activities whereas the amount of groundwater recharge its degree of mixing circulation residence time and temperature can be evaluated using hydrogeochemical data anoop et al 2021 in the present study groundwater samples were carefully collected from representative waterwheels from the central area of san luis potosí forty seven supply sources were located in the central area of san luis potosí fig 2 18 of these were in the agricultural area 24 in the urban area and 5 in the industrial area for sampling polyethylene bottles were previously submerged in a nitric acid solution for 24 h and rinsed with distilled water after collection and transport the samples were kept refrigerated at 4 c until their processing in the laboratory apha awwa 2005 in situ physicochemical parameters were determined for each of the samples ph temperature t dissolved oxygen do electrical conductivity ec and alkalinity alk sampling for organic matter cod toc and its preservation were carried out following the procedures established by apha awwa 2005 the cod was determined following the procedure outlined by apha awwa 2005 closed reflux method spectrophotometric method the major ions and trace elements were determined by the icp technique the anions sulfates and chlorides by colorimetry in the ipicyt laboratory and the alkalinity by titration in the field and laboratory the groundwater parameter data were used in spatial distribution diagrams to evaluate their behavior in the vslp 2 3 fluorescence eem spectroscopy in addition to the previous analyses the dissolved organic matter in each water sample was determined using 3d fluorescence the groundwater samples were diluted to a 2 0 mg l cod concentration by deionized water of high pressure liquid chromatography hplc grade the water samples were acidified with hcl to ph 3 to minimize metal complexation with dissolved organic carbon chen et al 2010 fuentes rivas et al 2015 and allow the scanning for each sample fluorescence spectra were performed using an ls55 perkinelmer spectrofluorometer and as an excitation source a 150 w xenon lamp the fluorescence analysis yielded 45 individual synchronized emission spectra at 250 600 nm emission wavelengths λem at 5 nm intervals and 200 450 nm excitation wavelengths λexc the scanning velocity speed was 1500 nm min and the generation time of the excitation emission matrix eem was 25 min approximately a spectrum of hplc grade deionized water was considered a blank and it was subtracted from all spectra to correct the spectrum of each analyzed sample groundwater chen et al 2003 the eem permits the analyses of spectral properties and identifies the components of an unknown mixture of fluorophores in addition it uses multiple λem and λexc with different intensities to find the total luminescence boehme et al 2004 fuentes rivas et al 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater hydrogeochemical quality the results of the physicochemical analyzes of collected water samples are presented in table 1 these results were compared with the standard reference values recommended by the who world health organization and nom 127 ssa1 1994 official mexican standard for human consumption the results show that parameters are within the permissible limits defined by the standards except for ph in 10 of the analyzed samples the ph is the logarithm of the reciprocal concentration of hydrogen ions which expresses the intensity of acidity or alkalinity of the water controlled by the concentrations of co2 co3 2 and hco3 hem 1991 the ph of waterwheel samples varies from 5 1 to 7 3 with a mean of 6 38 which shows the general acid tendency of groundwater fig 3 the spatial variation of the ph is observed in fig 3 and shows that the wells located in the industrial zone have a ph value lower than 6 while the ph of about 90 of the samples is concentrated in the agricultural and urban zones they range between 6 and 7 1 the physicochemical quality of groundwater plays an important role since its suitability for different purposes is determined based on it the electrical conductivity ec of groundwater depends on the temperature the ionic concentration and the types of ions present in the water the mean temperature of the groundwater samples was 20 19 c with a range of 15 23 c the who establishes the maximum permissible limit of ec in groundwater is 1500 μs cm who 2011 nom 127 ssa1 1994 where the study area electrical conductivity ec ranges between 150 and 2170 μs cm with a mean value of 1018 5 μs cm total dissolved solids tds values range between 107 and 4460 mg l with a mean of 789 mg l it has been established that tds values of groundwater within the range of 1000 to 10 000 mg l are considered brackish water fetter et al 2001 46 of the groundwater samples located in the urban area 40 of the industrial zone and 61 of the water samples in the agricultural zone belong to this group with a more significant predominance in the agricultural zone table 1 na concentrations range from 19 to 237 mg l with a mean of 81 23 mg l which constitute 30 67 of the main cations ca2 is the first dominant cation in groundwater constituting 49 54 with an average value of 131 19 mg l the average concentration of k in the groundwater of the study area is 35 90 mg l and constitutes 13 55 of the total cation meanwhile mg2 constitutes the lowest concentration in all observed groundwater and forms 6 21 with a mean of 16 46 mg l the trend of the main cationic concentrations of the groundwater samples is ca2 na k mg2 groundwater has a chloride ion cl range from 8 4 to 218 0 mg l the mean chloride concentration is 86 39 mg l and constitutes 18 of the total anionic compositions of the groundwater samples collected in the study area where the who limit for chloride in groundwater is 250 mg l who 2011 according to the study area geological characteristics it is reasonable to find values within limits however 2 of 47 samples are close to the limit of chloride concentrations established by the who hco3 ions concentration oscillates between 30 and 513 mg l with a mean value of 243 32 mg l it constitutes 53 of the total anions finally so4 2 ion with a range of 14 276 mg l and a value of the average of 113 23 mg l represent 24 of the anions the no3 ion concentrations range between 2 and 58 mg l with a mean value of 18 42 mg l representing 3 9 of the total anions table 2 the presence of nitrogenous species in groundwater is an important indicator of its quality the presence of no3 is associated with fertilizers that can cause their concentration to increase or incorporate residual water into the water resource the concentrations of no2 and nh4 ions are very low compared to no3 however these species are indicative of contamination dávalos peña et al 2021 fuentes rivas et al 2020 the anionic tendency of the analyzed groundwater is hco3 so4 2 cl no3 the distribution of no3 table 2 and so4 2 table 1 in the study area shows that the highest concentrations are located in the agricultural area fig 4 previous studies carried out in the study area report that in the analyzed area crop irrigation is carried out with water from wells so the presence of these ions in the water is associated with the application of fertilizers and the return of irrigation that causes an increase in their concentration in the water fuentes rivas et al 2015 2020 from the pearson correlation matrix of physicochemical parameters in groundwater table 2 it has been seen that tds are strongly correlated with sr ca2 mg2 nh4 and no3 in the industrial zone table 3 the cl ca2 mg2 sr and tds are closely related to each other in the urban zone table 4 while in the agricultural zone the correlation between the po4 3 ion with the cod and the nh4 ion is striking as well as the relationships between turbidity with fe toc cod and li significant relationships that confirm the fertilizers presence and the enrichment of these ions by the return of irrigation table 5 fuentes rivas et al 2020 in the three areas analyzed the nh4 ion is strongly correlated with mn the dispersion analysis carried out from the correlations found shows that the water in the agricultural area receives a contribution from the fertilizers due to the return of irrigation as shown in the dispersion graph between the ions nh4 versus po4 3 fig 5 b fig 4a shows the relationship of cl versus so4 2 this relationship it was observed that the origin of chlorides comes from different sources in agricultural and industrial areas the origin is mainly from the contribution of fertilizers while in the urban area about 33 of the samples originate from wastewater in the samples from the urban area a trend is observed and indicates contamination by wastewater fig 4b shows the relationship between nh4 and po4 3 the dispersion diagram shows the direct correlation between these parameters according to this graph the origin of the nh4 ion in the agricultural area is associated with the contribution by fertilizers while in the industrial and urban areas to contamination by residual water fig 5b 3 2 groundwater hydrogeochemical classification 3 2 1 hydrogeochemical facies and water type the piper diagram is an important graph that allows an understanding of the characteristics types and hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater it has been widely used to describe the chemistry of the water wen et al 2005 likewise this diagram allows analyzing the similarities and differences in the composition of water and grouping them into different chemical types so the hydrogeochemical facies allow us to establish the chemical evaluation of groundwater and its concept is to identify the composition of the water in different classes in addition to providing information on the chemical quality of the water and its origin the values obtained from the analyzed water samples were plotted on the trilinear diagram of piper 1953 fig 6 to recognize the hydrogeochemical facies which provide information on changes in groundwater quality in aquifers sivasubramanian et al 2013 the classification of the types of water is generally related to the different areas in which the concentrations of cations and anions are described within the defined composition categories plotting the piper samples the trilinear diagram fig 6 reveals nine types of water ca na hco3 cl 32 ca na so4 hco3 19 na ca hco3 cl 13 ca na hco3 so4 11 where these four are the predominant facies type ca hco3 cl 9 ca na cl so4 4 na ca so4 4 ca mg na so4 hco3 4 ca so4 hco3 cl 4 this indicates the predominance of ca2 and na as cations and interactions of cl and hco3 in anions these facies were analyzed in each area of the delimited areas finding that in the industrial zone five types were observed in which the so4 2 ion and the ca2 and na cations predominate while in urban and agricultural areas the ca na hco3 cl type predominated the chemical composition of groundwater is affected by processes that occur in the aquifer and within them including rock weathering evaporation and ion exchange ion exchange is a natural process that occurs in the groundwater system that alters the physicochemical composition of water for human use and consumption li et al 2016 hydrogeochemical processes are generally identified using scatter plots fig 7 the na vs cl identifies processes of ion exchange and albite alteration an and lu 2018 sarikhani et al 2015 fig 7b shows that a cation exchange process occurs where reverse reactions predominate the high sodium concentration may be due to the exchange with ions such as ca2 and mg2 bouzourra et al 2015 the content of bicarbonate ions can come from sources such as atmospheric co2 and mineral carbonate solution among others associated with the geological characteristics of the site under study ahmed et al 2013 fig 7a shows two trends the first where 70 of the samples experience the carbonate dissolution process and the remaining 30 in the direction of silicate weathering while in fig 7b the predominance of the reverse ion exchange process is observed and about 30 of the sample ion exchange and albite weathering the results show that the main processes that affect and control the chemical composition of the water in the shallow aquifer of slp are silicate weathering albite weathering carbonate dissolution and reverse ion exchange ionic ratios confirmed the reverse ion exchange process where ca2 and mg2 ions in the aquifer matrix are replaced by na ions at sites where the exchange is favorable zaidi et al 2015 reverse ion exchange explains the dominance of ca2 and mg2 ions over na ions at most sites confirmed by the piper diagram that is an exchange between na and k in the groundwater with ca2 and mg2 in the aquifer material will result in a positive saturation index indicating reverse ion exchange otherwise an exchange between the na and k in the aquifer with the ca2 and mg2 in the groundwater will result in a negative saturation index indicating ion exchange in addition to the above an enrichment of cl ions is observed fig 7b this behavior can be associated with atmospheric deposition or a saline intrusion process in the specific case of the area under study it is worth mentioning that the water samples were collected at depths between 20 30 m therefore the cl enrichment can be attributed to anthropogenic sources such as irrigation return flows or household waste disposal srinivasamoorthy et al 2008 zaidi et al 2015 3 3 fluorescence eem spectroscopy analysis through 3d fluorescence analysis it was possible to identify the presence of dissolved organic matter mod in groundwater as shown in fig 8 the mee is divided into five regions in regions i and ii in the excitation emission wavelength ranges the aromatic proteins are located and considered part of the dissolved organic matter of anthropogenic origin region iii and v related to fulvic and humic acids respectively are attributed to organic matter of natural origin while a peak located in region iv is considered to be a bacterial degradation product anthropogenic organic matter chen et al 2003 according to the fluorescence results the spectra obtained show the anthropogenic origin of the dom present in the samples according to the methodology presented by westerhoff 2001 based on the mee on the maximum relative intensity between each pair of peaks and on the presence or absence of dom the 47 samples analyzed show particular characteristics of each zone the samples collected in the agricultural area present as the main characteristic the presence of dissolved organic matter of natural origin humic and fulvic acids in some cases although with not well defined peaks the presence of aromatic proteins and mainly the presence of nitrogenous species which generate a shift in the fluorescence spectrum fuentes rivas et al 2017a b 2021 fig 9 the presence of nitrogenous species no3 nh4 no2 may be associated with the agricultural activity that takes place in the area the eem in the industrial zone fig 10 unlike the agricultural zone shows the presence of dissolved organic matter of anthropogenic origin and well defined peaks associated with natural organic matter however samples with highly shifted fluorescence spectra and several well defined aromatic protein peaks at the same excitation wavelength were also identified the results obtained in the samples from the urban area fig 11 do not show signs of anthropic contamination in the groundwater because high intensity humic and fulvic peaks predominate in these samples and therefore the relationship of intensities between these and the protein peaks for uncontaminated water 1 3 it is fulfilled baker and spencer 2004 yoshioka et al 2007 the eem which can be seen in figs 8 10 and 11 were obtained with the samples from the aforementioned sources in the eem diagrams on the x axis the emission wavelength is represented from 250 to 600 nm and on the y axis the excitation at wavelengths from 200 to 420 nm the contour lines and the numbers represent the intensity of the fluorescence in the third dimension 3d being for this analysis 50 in each eem performing the analysis of the hydrogeochemical data and integrating the correlation analysis and the dispersion graphs together with the comparison of the permissible limits established by the official mexican standard and the who it is possible to verify that the physicochemical quality of the groundwater of the study area complies with those specified in said standards however some parameters are not regulated because they are generally present in water contaminated by municipal discharges or by solid waste leaching which when present in the water alter its physicochemical characteristics and compromise the quality of the limited resource its use 4 conclusions the groundwater quality in the study area is fresh and according to the ph range mainly slightly acidic to slightly alkaline in nature the analysis of the hydrogeochemical data indicates that the groundwater in the study area according to the piper diagram is of the ca na hco3 cl type of water the abundance of total cations was found in the order of ca2 na k mg2 and of anions in the order hco3 so4 2 cl no3 groundwater quality in the study area is influenced by the chemical weathering of rock forming minerals the shallow groundwater in the study area contains nitrogenous species in some of the samples in concentrations that exceed the limits established in the standards therefore it is not suitable for drinking the concentrations of cl na tds and ec indicate that the water quality of the groundwater in the study area is significantly degraded and suffers from an accumulation of ions due to return irrigation the evaluation of the suitability of the water for irrigation use suggests that sulfate phosphate and nitrate ions are not a concern in the area however the rest of the parameters indicate that the shallow groundwater in the area may be suitable for irrigation purposes the content of no3 4 0 50 0 mg l 1 nh4 0 03 40 0 mg l 1 so4 2 20 0 276 0 mg l 1 y

fluorescence 3d shows the presence of nitrogenous species no3 nh4 no2 may be associated with the agricultural activity that takes place in the area pollutants associated with municipal discharges and the application of fertilizers alter the physicochemical characteristics of the water and compromise its quality limiting its use the results of 3d fluorescence eem found in the study area confirm the contamination of the shallow aquifer water conditioning its use to irrigation and not to human consumption the results of this study demonstrate that the main processes that affect and control the chemical composition of the water in the shallow aquifer of slp are silicate weathering albite weathering carbonate dissolution and reverse ion exchange funding this study was financed by consejo

carranza álvarez et al 2008 this study aims through an analysis of the hydrogeochemical processes present in the shallow aquifer located in the central area of san luis potosí mexico to establish the degree of contamination associated with the type of land use and the anthropogenic activities present in the study area fuentes rivas et al 2020 2 2 groundwater chemical and quality the chemical analysis of groundwater is decisive to establish its quality since it depends on various parameters such as geology geomorphology and industrial urban and agricultural activities whereas the amount of groundwater recharge its degree of mixing circulation residence time and temperature can be evaluated using hydrogeochemical data anoop et al 2021 in the present study groundwater samples were carefully collected from representative waterwheels from the central area of san luis potosí forty seven supply sources were located in the central area of san luis potosí fig 2 18 of these were in the agricultural area 24 in the urban area and 5 in the industrial area for sampling polyethylene bottles were previously submerged in a nitric acid solution for 24 h and rinsed with distilled water after collection and transport the samples were kept refrigerated at 4 c until their processing in the laboratory apha awwa 2005 in situ physicochemical parameters were determined for each of the samples ph temperature t dissolved oxygen do electrical conductivity ec and alkalinity alk sampling for organic matter cod toc and its preservation were carried out following the procedures established by apha awwa 2005 the cod was determined following the procedure outlined by apha awwa 2005 closed reflux method spectrophotometric method the major ions and trace elements were determined by the icp technique the anions sulfates and chlorides by colorimetry in the ipicyt laboratory and the alkalinity by titration in the field and laboratory the groundwater parameter data were used in spatial distribution diagrams to evaluate their behavior in the vslp 2 3 fluorescence eem spectroscopy in addition to the previous analyses the dissolved organic matter in each water sample was determined using 3d fluorescence the groundwater samples were diluted to a 2 0 mg l cod concentration by deionized water of high pressure liquid chromatography hplc grade the water samples were acidified with hcl to ph 3 to minimize metal complexation with dissolved organic carbon chen et al 2010 fuentes rivas et al 2015 and allow the scanning for each sample fluorescence spectra were performed using an ls55 perkinelmer spectrofluorometer and as an excitation source a 150 w xenon lamp the fluorescence analysis yielded 45 individual synchronized emission spectra at 250 600 nm emission wavelengths λem at 5 nm intervals and 200 450 nm excitation wavelengths λexc the scanning velocity speed was 1500 nm min and the generation time of the excitation emission matrix eem was 25 min approximately a spectrum of hplc grade deionized water was considered a blank and it was subtracted from all spectra to correct the spectrum of each analyzed sample groundwater chen et al 2003 the eem permits the analyses of spectral properties and identifies the components of an unknown mixture of fluorophores in addition it uses multiple λem and λexc with different intensities to find the total luminescence boehme et al 2004 fuentes rivas et al 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater hydrogeochemical quality the results of the physicochemical analyzes of collected water samples are presented in table 1 these results were compared with the standard reference values recommended by the who world health organization and nom 127 ssa1 1994 official mexican standard for human consumption the results show that parameters are within the permissible limits defined by the standards except for ph in 10 of the analyzed samples the ph is the logarithm of the reciprocal concentration of hydrogen ions which expresses the intensity of acidity or alkalinity of the water controlled by the concentrations of co2 co3 2 and hco3 hem 1991 the ph of waterwheel samples varies from 5 1 to 7 3 with a mean of 6 38 which shows the general acid tendency of groundwater fig 3 the spatial variation of the ph is observed in fig 3 and shows that the wells located in the industrial zone have a ph value lower than 6 while the ph of about 90 of the samples is concentrated in the agricultural and urban zones they range between 6 and 7 1 the physicochemical quality of groundwater plays an important role since its suitability for different purposes is determined based on it the electrical conductivity ec of groundwater depends on the temperature the ionic concentration and the types of ions present in the water the mean temperature of the groundwater samples was 20 19 c with a range of 15 23 c the who establishes the maximum permissible limit of ec in groundwater is 1500 μs cm who 2011 nom 127 ssa1 1994 where the study area electrical conductivity ec ranges between 150 and 2170 μs cm with a mean value of 1018 5 μs cm total dissolved solids tds values range between 107 and 4460 mg l with a mean of 789 mg l it has been established that tds values of groundwater within the range of 1000 to 10 000 mg l are considered brackish water fetter et al 2001 46 of the groundwater samples located in the urban area 40 of the industrial zone and 61 of the water samples in the agricultural zone belong to this group with a more significant predominance in the agricultural zone table 1 na concentrations range from 19 to 237 mg l with a mean of 81 23 mg l which constitute 30 67 of the main cations ca2 is the first dominant cation in groundwater constituting 49 54 with an average value of 131 19 mg l the average concentration of k in the groundwater of the study area is 35 90 mg l and constitutes 13 55 of the total cation meanwhile mg2 constitutes the lowest concentration in all observed groundwater and forms 6 21 with a mean of 16 46 mg l the trend of the main cationic concentrations of the groundwater samples is ca2 na k mg2 groundwater has a chloride ion cl range from 8 4 to 218 0 mg l the mean chloride concentration is 86 39 mg l and constitutes 18 of the total anionic compositions of the groundwater samples collected in the study area where the who limit for chloride in groundwater is 250 mg l who 2011 according to the study area geological characteristics it is reasonable to find values within limits however 2 of 47 samples are close to the limit of chloride concentrations established by the who hco3 ions concentration oscillates between 30 and 513 mg l with a mean value of 243 32 mg l it constitutes 53 of the total anions finally so4 2 ion with a range of 14 276 mg l and a value of the average of 113 23 mg l represent 24 of the anions the no3 ion concentrations range between 2 and 58 mg l with a mean value of 18 42 mg l representing 3 9 of the total anions table 2 the presence of nitrogenous species in groundwater is an important indicator of its quality the presence of no3 is associated with fertilizers that can cause their concentration to increase or incorporate residual water into the water resource the concentrations of no2 and nh4 ions are very low compared to no3 however these species are indicative of contamination dávalos peña et al 2021 fuentes rivas et al 2020 the anionic tendency of the analyzed groundwater is hco3 so4 2 cl no3 the distribution of no3 table 2 and so4 2 table 1 in the study area shows that the highest concentrations are located in the agricultural area fig 4 previous studies carried out in the study area report that in the analyzed area crop irrigation is carried out with water from wells so the presence of these ions in the water is associated with the application of fertilizers and the return of irrigation that causes an increase in their concentration in the water fuentes rivas et al 2015 2020 from the pearson correlation matrix of physicochemical parameters in groundwater table 2 it has been seen that tds are strongly correlated with sr ca2 mg2 nh4 and no3 in the industrial zone table 3 the cl ca2 mg2 sr and tds are closely related to each other in the urban zone table 4 while in the agricultural zone the correlation between the po4 3 ion with the cod and the nh4 ion is striking as well as the relationships between turbidity with fe toc cod and li significant relationships that confirm the fertilizers presence and the enrichment of these ions by the return of irrigation table 5 fuentes rivas et al 2020 in the three areas analyzed the nh4 ion is strongly correlated with mn the dispersion analysis carried out from the correlations found shows that the water in the agricultural area receives a contribution from the fertilizers due to the return of irrigation as shown in the dispersion graph between the ions nh4 versus po4 3 fig 5 b fig 4a shows the relationship of cl versus so4 2 this relationship it was observed that the origin of chlorides comes from different sources in agricultural and industrial areas the origin is mainly from the contribution of fertilizers while in the urban area about 33 of the samples originate from wastewater in the samples from the urban area a trend is observed and indicates contamination by wastewater fig 4b shows the relationship between nh4 and po4 3 the dispersion diagram shows the direct correlation between these parameters according to this graph the origin of the nh4 ion in the agricultural area is associated with the contribution by fertilizers while in the industrial and urban areas to contamination by residual water fig 5b 3 2 groundwater hydrogeochemical classification 3 2 1 hydrogeochemical facies and water type the piper diagram is an important graph that allows an understanding of the characteristics types and hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater it has been widely used to describe the chemistry of the water wen et al 2005 likewise this diagram allows analyzing the similarities and differences in the composition of water and grouping them into different chemical types so the hydrogeochemical facies allow us to establish the chemical evaluation of groundwater and its concept is to identify the composition of the water in different classes in addition to providing information on the chemical quality of the water and its origin the values obtained from the analyzed water samples were plotted on the trilinear diagram of piper 1953 fig 6 to recognize the hydrogeochemical facies which provide information on changes in groundwater quality in aquifers sivasubramanian et al 2013 the classification of the types of water is generally related to the different areas in which the concentrations of cations and anions are described within the defined composition categories plotting the piper samples the trilinear diagram fig 6 reveals nine types of water ca na hco3 cl 32 ca na so4 hco3 19 na ca hco3 cl 13 ca na hco3 so4 11 where these four are the predominant facies type ca hco3 cl 9 ca na cl so4 4 na ca so4 4 ca mg na so4 hco3 4 ca so4 hco3 cl 4 this indicates the predominance of ca2 and na as cations and interactions of cl and hco3 in anions these facies were analyzed in each area of the delimited areas finding that in the industrial zone five types were observed in which the so4 2 ion and the ca2 and na cations predominate while in urban and agricultural areas the ca na hco3 cl type predominated the chemical composition of groundwater is affected by processes that occur in the aquifer and within them including rock weathering evaporation and ion exchange ion exchange is a natural process that occurs in the groundwater system that alters the physicochemical composition of water for human use and consumption li et al 2016 hydrogeochemical processes are generally identified using scatter plots fig 7 the na vs cl identifies processes of ion exchange and albite alteration an and lu 2018 sarikhani et al 2015 fig 7b shows that a cation exchange process occurs where reverse reactions predominate the high sodium concentration may be due to the exchange with ions such as ca2 and mg2 bouzourra et al 2015 the content of bicarbonate ions can come from sources such as atmospheric co2 and mineral carbonate solution among others associated with the geological characteristics of the site under study ahmed et al 2013 fig 7a shows two trends the first where 70 of the samples experience the carbonate dissolution process and the remaining 30 in the direction of silicate weathering while in fig 7b the predominance of the reverse ion exchange process is observed and about 30 of the sample ion exchange and albite weathering the results show that the main processes that affect and control the chemical composition of the water in the shallow aquifer of slp are silicate weathering albite weathering carbonate dissolution and reverse ion exchange ionic ratios confirmed the reverse ion exchange process where ca2 and mg2 ions in the aquifer matrix are replaced by na ions at sites where the exchange is favorable zaidi et al 2015 reverse ion exchange explains the dominance of ca2 and mg2 ions over na ions at most sites confirmed by the piper diagram that is an exchange between na and k in the groundwater with ca2 and mg2 in the aquifer material will result in a positive saturation index indicating reverse ion exchange otherwise an exchange between the na and k in the aquifer with the ca2 and mg2 in the groundwater will result in a negative saturation index indicating ion exchange in addition to the above an enrichment of cl ions is observed fig 7b this behavior can be associated with atmospheric deposition or a saline intrusion process in the specific case of the area under study it is worth mentioning that the water samples were collected at depths between 20 30 m therefore the cl enrichment can be attributed to anthropogenic sources such as irrigation return flows or household waste disposal srinivasamoorthy et al 2008 zaidi et al 2015 3 3 fluorescence eem spectroscopy analysis through 3d fluorescence analysis it was possible to identify the presence of dissolved organic matter mod in groundwater as shown in fig 8 the mee is divided into five regions in regions i and ii in the excitation emission wavelength ranges the aromatic proteins are located and considered part of the dissolved organic matter of anthropogenic origin region iii and v related to fulvic and humic acids respectively are attributed to organic matter of natural origin while a peak located in region iv is considered to be a bacterial degradation product anthropogenic organic matter chen et al 2003 according to the fluorescence results the spectra obtained show the anthropogenic origin of the dom present in the samples according to the methodology presented by westerhoff 2001 based on the mee on the maximum relative intensity between each pair of peaks and on the presence or absence of dom the 47 samples analyzed show particular characteristics of each zone the samples collected in the agricultural area present as the main characteristic the presence of dissolved organic matter of natural origin humic and fulvic acids in some cases although with not well defined peaks the presence of aromatic proteins and mainly the presence of nitrogenous species which generate a shift in the fluorescence spectrum fuentes rivas et al 2017a b 2021 fig 9 the presence of nitrogenous species no3 nh4 no2 may be associated with the agricultural activity that takes place in the area the eem in the industrial zone fig 10 unlike the agricultural zone shows the presence of dissolved organic matter of anthropogenic origin and well defined peaks associated with natural organic matter however samples with highly shifted fluorescence spectra and several well defined aromatic protein peaks at the same excitation wavelength were also identified the results obtained in the samples from the urban area fig 11 do not show signs of anthropic contamination in the groundwater because high intensity humic and fulvic peaks predominate in these samples and therefore the relationship of intensities between these and the protein peaks for uncontaminated water 1 3 it is fulfilled baker and spencer 2004 yoshioka et al 2007 the eem which can be seen in figs 8 10 and 11 were obtained with the samples from the aforementioned sources in the eem diagrams on the x axis the emission wavelength is represented from 250 to 600 nm and on the y axis the excitation at wavelengths from 200 to 420 nm the contour lines and the numbers represent the intensity of the fluorescence in the third dimension 3d being for this analysis 50 in each eem performing the analysis of the hydrogeochemical data and integrating the correlation analysis and the dispersion graphs together with the comparison of the permissible limits established by the official mexican standard and the who it is possible to verify that the physicochemical quality of the groundwater of the study area complies with those specified in said standards however some parameters are not regulated because they are generally present in water contaminated by municipal discharges or by solid waste leaching which when present in the water alter its physicochemical characteristics and compromise the quality of the limited resource its use 4 conclusions the groundwater quality in the study area is fresh and according to the ph range mainly slightly acidic to slightly alkaline in nature the analysis of the hydrogeochemical data indicates that the groundwater in the study area according to the piper diagram is of the ca na hco3 cl type of water the abundance of total cations was found in the order of ca2 na k mg2 and of anions in the order hco3 so4 2 cl no3 groundwater quality in the study area is influenced by the chemical weathering of rock forming minerals the shallow groundwater in the study area contains nitrogenous species in some of the samples in concentrations that exceed the limits established in the standards therefore it is not suitable for drinking the concentrations of cl na tds and ec indicate that the water quality of the groundwater in the study area is significantly degraded and suffers from an accumulation of ions due to return irrigation the evaluation of the suitability of the water for irrigation use suggests that sulfate phosphate and nitrate ions are not a concern in the area however the rest of the parameters indicate that the shallow groundwater in the area may be suitable for irrigation purposes the content of no3 4 0 50 0 mg l 1 nh4 0 03 40 0 mg l 1 so4 2 20 0 276 0 mg l 1 y po4 3 0 01 45 5 mg l 1 indicate contamination that may come from inorganic and organic matter organic matter of anthropogenic associated with wastewater origin was identified by 3d fluorescence fluorescence 3d shows the presence of nitrogenous species no3 nh4 no2 may be associated with the agricultural activity that takes place in the area pollutants associated with municipal discharges and the application of fertilizers alter the physicochemical characteristics of the water and compromise its quality limiting its use the results of 3d fluorescence eem found in the study area confirm the contamination of the shallow aquifer water conditioning its use to irrigation and not to human consumption the results of this study demonstrate that the main processes that affect and control the chemical composition of the water in the shallow aquifer of slp are silicate weathering albite weathering carbonate dissolution and reverse ion exchange funding this study was financed by consejo

11726,groundwater salinization is a severe worldwide issue affecting many coastal aquifers by threatening their freshwater resources werner et al 2013 michael et al 2017 the matanza riachuelo river basin mrrb is a coastal continental basin that supplies fresh water to the greater buenos aires conurbation encompassing approximately 10 of argentina s population among other environmental degradation issues salinization is one of the most important processes affecting the mrrb in this study salinization across the mrrb was unraveled using major cl hco3 so4 na ca mg and tracer br solutes together with stable 18o 2h 13c and radioactive isotopes 3h 14c three different saline end members were identified upper basin slightly saline ubss lower basin highly saline lbhs and lower basin hyper saline lbhps the salinity of the ubss and the lbhps end members was associated with the miocene paraná formation connate marine water while the salinity of the lbhs end member were associated with the pleistocene to holocene postpampeano sediments connate seawater the estimated 14c values were related to travel time differences in the flow paths delivering water to different zones of the puelche aquifer groundwater in the upper basin sector of the puelche aquifer was likely to belong to long regional groundwater flow recharged outside the mrrb boundary groundwater in the top of the puelche aquifer at the lower basin comes from the upper aquifer through vertical transfer this study contributes to a better understanding of 1 salinization processes linked to connate marine water of different ages in the matanza riachuelo aquifer system and 2 different sources of flow paths delivering groundwater to the upper and lower sectors of the confined puelche aquifer the knowledge generated from this study can help to understand groundwater salinization processes in other aquifer systems around the world and support groundwater management plans across the mrrb

particular region is fundamental to understanding present conditions and trends as well as foreseeing the possible evolution of groundwater salinity under expected managed or unmanaged scenarios werner et al 2013 michael et al 2017 groundwater salinization can be caused by both natural processes and human activities the main natural processes include present day marine intrusion barlow and reichard 2010 costall et al 2020 mixing with connate or intruded palaeo marine water manzano et al 2001 tijani et al 2004 yamanaka and kumagai 2006 groundwater salinization also is caused by mixing

areas llamas and custodio 2003 mahlknecht et al 2017 alfarrah and walraevens 2018 custodio 2018 are shown to trigger or enhance groundwater salinization with a population of around 16 million people the buenos aires metropolitan area supports one third of argentina and is one of the most populated areas in south america the matanza riachuelo aquifer system mras is a coastal continental aquifer system in the matanza riachuelo river basin mrrb north east argentina the mras has been intensively used in the buenos aires area for urban and industrial purposes since the 1970s and had severe quality problems mainly related to nitrate arsenic and salinity while high nitrate concentrations result from anthropogenic activities relatively high arsenic concentrations and groundwater salinization issues result from natural processes the deterioration of air soil surface water ad groundwater quality in the mras became a significant issue for the argentinian government in 2008 that year the alarming contamination conditions of the mrrb led the supreme court of justice of argentina to issue a collective sentence to the matanza riachuelo basin authority acumar the national government the government of the province of buenos aires and the government of the autonomous city of buenos aires the sentence required the issuance of an urgent final and effective decision to improve the quality of life of the local population recover the environment and prevent further damage in advance cafferatta 2009 as a result acumar designed and implemented the integrated environmental sanitation plan plan integral de saneamiento ambiental pisa acumar 2009 and began monitoring groundwater surface water sediments and air the pisa implementation emphasized the need for adequate knowledge of groundwater processes including the hydrogeochemical processes providing groundwater natural characteristics as well as the existing pollution processes and their impact on groundwater quality understanding the origin of groundwater salinization is imperative to evaluate new management strategies once the source of salinity is identified groundwater plans can be implemented to reduce the influence of the salinity source and if possible improve the quality of pumped groundwater the groundwater chemistry of the mras was first reported by unlp 2010 based on a thorough study of the basic chemistry of 135 samples over the entire region aquifer the study was complemented by zabala et al 2016 who established the groundwater chemical baseline by comparing 570 samples from the upper aquifer and 322 samples from the puelche aquifer taken between may 2008 and september 2011 the results showed extensive areas of both aquifers with fresh groundwater and a stable chemical composition for the studied period saline water was only reported in a few areas of the aquifer they also showed that the chemical composition of fresh groundwater in the whole mras resulted from chemical and physical processes occurring primarily after groundwater recharge the primary chemical processes included edaphic co2 dissolution silicate weathering cation exchange and precipitation of secondary minerals evapotranspiration and mixing of fresh and saline groundwater in different zones of the aquifer system were already proposed as the most important physical processes with the second one transforming fresh into slightly saline and salt groundwater the roles of chemical processes and evapotranspiration with particular reference to arsenic were already studied in detail by armengol et al 2017 2020 however the role of mixing processes remained scarcely analyzed up to now the overall objective of this study was to improve the conceptual groundwater quality model in the mras by understanding the origin and occurrence of different salinization processes first the areas with saline water were selected based on the results of more extensive studies in the area described above then chemical and isotope tracers were measured in groundwater from these selected areas second a review of the geological history of the basin was carried out allowing identifying potential salinity origins and a better understanding of the location of saline groundwater in very specific areas of the mras finally hydrogeochemical modeling of conservative and reactive mixing was developed to support the proposed conceptual models and understand the mixing processes occurring in the different selected areas of the system 2 the study area 2 1 geology the mrrb covers an area of 2048 km2 fig 1 the matanza riachuelo river runs across 77 km in the sw ne direction before reaching the río de la plata estuary the mras is made up of several sedimentary units from bottom to top they are the arenas puelches formation the pampeano sediments and the postpampeano sediments the mras develops above the paraná formation a widely extended marine unit fig 1 formed during the middle miocene to lower pliocene representing the youngest tertiary marine transgression regression recorded in the chaco paraná basin fernández garrasino and vrba 2000 the paraná formation lies over the crystalline basement the arenas puelches formation is a large continental unit of plio pleistocene age with a spatial extension of 240 000 km2 auge et al 2002 it is composed mainly of fluvial quartz sands with intercalations of gravels and clays at the bottom and central parts and clays at the top santa cruz 1972 logan and nicholson 1998 in the mrrb the sandy part has a thickness between 13 and 33 m mancino et al 2013 the top clayey layer is not continuous has a variable thickness between 1 and 12 m and thickens to the sw mancino et al 2013 the top of the arenas puelches formation is around 15 m deep to the ne of the mrrb and 63 77 m deep to the sw and it does not crop out in the basin the pampeano sediments is a late pliocene continental unit it extends across 1 m km2 of the 2 8 m km2 of continental argentina and the southern part of paraguay in the mrrb they are formed by two main geological formations ensenada and buenos aires which consist of clays fine sands and silty loess of fluvial lacustrine and eolian environments and have abundant secondary carbonate layers frenguelli 1957 fidalgo 1975 riggi et al 1986 the pampeano sediments crop out across most of the mrrb and their thickness ranges from a few to some 60 m increasing from ne to sw fig 1 the postpampeano sediments are of pleistocene to holocene age they only exist along the río de la plata coastal plain and in the lower reaches of the matanza riachuelo river valley logan and rudolph 1997 auge et al 2002 they are formed by several geological formations luján late pleistocene lower holocene fidalgo et al 1973b 1975 sala 1972 la plata middle to upper holocene frenguelli 1957 la postrera late pleistocene late holocene fidalgo et al 1973a 1975 and querandí holocene cavallotto et al 2005 doering 1882 frenguelli 1957 the four formations are sandy and silty mud of fluvial lacustrine and marsh environments in the mrrb the thickness of the postpampeano sediments ranges from a few to some 30 m decreasing from sw to ne fig 1 partially covering the postpampeano sediments there are recent sandy silty and clayey deposits of eolian and deltaic origin the area where the mrrb is located had experienced several marine transgressions throughout its geological history two of them were more relevant for this work the oldest transgression is known as the entrerriense paranense transgression ept and took place in the middle late miocene generating the paraná formation the most recent transgression occurred during the pleistocene holocene and originated the marine formations of the postpampean sediments the ept was a large scale regional transgression the resulting paraná formation is considered a single unit of marine origin marengo 2006 with facies characteristic of more distal to more proximal environments depending on its location aceñolaza 2000 the paraná sea occupied a vast extension that roughly coincides with the chaco pampean plain a vast plain 1 m km2 extending across central and north argentina and parts of bolivia paraguay uruguay and brasil the paraná formation sediments still held marine water however the bibliographic sources cavallotto et al 2005 logan and nicholson 1998 aceñolaza 2000 marengo 2006 coincided in characterizing the marine facies located in the coastal part of the pampean plain as littoral shallow depth and settled in a hyposaline environment lower salinity than the current sea in the late miocene began a transition from marine to continental conditions and gypsum was deposited in coastal lagoons aceñolaza 2000 marengo 2006 fossils found in the postpampean sediments led violante and parker 1999 and cavallotto and violante 2005 to identify six transgressive and regressive cycles corresponding to glacial and interglacial stages with five corresponding to the plio pleistocene and one to the holocene beilinson et al 2019 the most crucial transgression that occurred during this last cycle formed the querandí formation frenguelli 1957 this formation appears along the coastal plain and lower tract of the alluvial valleys and its sediments hold saline pore water logan and nicholson 1998 2 2 hydrogeology from the hydrogeological point of view the geological units described above form the puelche aquifer the aquitard and the upper aquifer of the mras fig 1 underlying the mras the paraná formation also consists of an aquifer topped by an aquitard however due to its elevated salinity auge et al 2002 mention 3 4 g l under the mrrb it is only exploited locally during water demand peaks for industrial purposes however this hydrogeological feature was essential for studying the salinity sources in the mras the puelche aquifer consists of the lower sandy section of the arenas puelches formation it behaves as a confined aquifer and is the most exploited in the mrrb due to its high transmissivity and usually good quality auge 1986 2004 the dominant conceptual model sets that groundwater recharge takes place at a regional scale in the interfluvial areas from the upper aquifer most notably in the main divide with the salado river basin located to the sw of the mrrb not shown in fig 1 the upper aquifer is formed by the pampeano sediments postpampeano sediments and the most recent sediments overlaying the postpampeano sediments the shallow part of the upper aquifer behaves as a phreatic aquifer while from 30 to 50 m depth it behaves as semiconfined auge et al 2002 the upper aquifer recharges mainly from rainfall however as the basin includes part of buenos aires city conurbation a notable recharge also occurs from the leaking water supply networks septic tanks and stormwater drainage systems due to its lower transmissivity this aquifer is less exploited than the puelche and is mostly for rural and suburban uses the top clayey layer of the arenas puelches formation behaves as an aquitard between the puelche and the upper aquifers but due to its discontinuity and heterogeneity it only plays a role at the local and subregional scale at a regional scale both aquifers show similar piezometric patterns fig 2 a and b with groundwater flowing from sw to ne to the río de la plata estuary the hydraulic connection between the two aquifers is notable in most of the basin as they respond simultaneously to seasonal variations produced by rainwater recharge episodes and dry season drawdowns zabala et al 2016 this is consistent with the discontinuous pattern of the aquitard between both aquifers fig 2c shows a simplified conceptual model of the groundwater balance in the mras for the period 1906 2014 ihlla 2015a for this work the numbers were not as relevant as the concepts the scheme shows that there is a lateral transfer of groundwater from the prolongation of both aquifers to the sw beyond the mrrb border also relevant was the fact that the upper aquifer recharges the puelche aquifer in most of the basin except in the lower basin where groundwater flow was reversed under the natural or close to natural conditions reflected by fig 2c the puelche aquifer was intensively exploited till the 1980s this produced severe piezometric depression cones that inverted the prevailing upward groundwater flow and caused the vertical transfer of pollutants nitrate hydrocarbons from the upper aquifer in the coastal part of the basin this pumping induced the intrusion of holocene marine water that was trapped in the sediments under the río de la plata estuary as a consequence many exploitations were closed and substituted by treated surface water from the río de la plata auge et al 2002 therefore the present day pumping rate of both aquifers is not relevant just around a quarter of the total discharge to the río de la plata and one sixteenth of their discharge to rivers and lagoons 2 3 hydrochemistry groundwater from both aquifers of the mras is mostly fresh ec from 0 6 to 1 5 ms cm 1 and na hco3 type fig 3 these characteristics are the combined result of a short number of processes evapoconcentration edaphic co2 and silicate dissolution cation exchange in volcanic glass calcite precipitation and probable clay formation these processes occur during the transit of recharge water across the unsaturated zone of the upper aquifer and the resulting na hco3 groundwater reaches most of the puelche aquifer without further changes armengol et al 2020 however there are a few zones of both aquifers where there is slight to highly saline groundwater for example in the lower basin area near the río de la plata estuary groundwater is moderately to highly saline and na cl type in both aquifers fig 3 with electrical conductivity values ec 6 to 10 ms cm 1 in the upper aquifer and up to 55 ms cm 1 borehole 37p in fig 3b in the puelche aquifer moreover there is a sector from the upper basin area where groundwater of the puelche aquifer is slightly saline of na so4cl type and with ec 2 to 4 ms cm 1 fig 3b given that saline waters are located in very specific areas of the basin and that since 2000 yr ago the aquifers are not in contact with the sea cavallotto et al 2005 marengo 2006 the existence of saline waters must be the result of fresh na hco3 water mixing with existing saline and or salt groundwater in the sediments of those areas 3 materials and methods data used were major and trace solutes cl hco3 so4 na ca mg br and

analyses six rainwater collectors were designed following the design recommended by the isotopic hydrology laboratory of the international atomic energy agency gröning et al 2012 the collectors were homogeneously distributed throughout the basin fig 1 in october 2014 and the sampling was carried out monthly until september 2017 the samples were accumulated and aliquots from each station were analyzed quarterly table s1 the piezometers sampled in this study were specially built to study the upper aquifer and the lower aquifer of the matanza riachuelo aquifer system and belong to the acumar groundwater network the upper aquifer network consists of 35 piezometers and the lower aquifer network consists of 34 piezometers all of them equipped with short screens located on each aquifer the minimum maximum and average screen length are 1 7 and 6 m respectively nine piezometers 2p 6p 12p 17p 18p 29p 30p 33p and 37p with slightly to high salinity were selected for this study to increase the number of samples acumar under the assessment of ihlla added two sets of five piezometers at different depths near the coast to the existing network with the objective to capture saline groundwater due to the non homogenous distribution of the old marine sediments hosting connate seawater only 3 of 10 piezometers captured moderate saline groundwater 6b 6c 6d and were selected all the mentioned piezometers were sampled in july 2015 for chemical and isotopic determinations fig 1 major chemical components na k ca mg cl and so4 were analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy and flame

addition bromide br concentrations were measured in aliquot samples at the instituto geológico y minero de españa igme in madrid following an improved epa 300 method hautman and munch 1997 a metrohm 881 ic pro ionic chromatography was used the overall analytical accuracy reported as relative errors was around 6 the analyses of δ18o and δ2h in groundwater were carried out by laser spectroscopy at

v smow in this work only the δ18o values have been used the reported δ18o analytical uncertainties range from 0 1 to 0 3 sampling for δ13c and 14c measurements of tdic was conducted using the procedure of the centre for isotope research of groningen university the netherlands where the analyses were performed water samples were collected in 500 ml caramel glass bottles that were filled sterilized with an i2ki solution tightly closed kept in dark and sent to the laboratory few days after sampling 14c activities were measured by accelerator mass spectrometry ams and δ13c were measured by irms δ13c values are reported in after the vienna pee dee belemnite standard v pdb the reported δ13c analytical uncertainties range from 0 16 to 0 35 samples for tritium 3h analyses were taken in 1

reported in tritium units tu and the reported uncertainties were 0 2 tu 1 σ 3 2 soil organic matter sampling and isotopic analyses soil organic matter som samples were taken in the first 25 cm of soil and at three locations in the upper middle and lower basin fig 1 the δ13csom analyses of organic carbon were carried out at the instituto de geocronología y geología isotópica of the buenos aires university ingeis argentina samples were analyzed by an elemental analyzer carlo erba ea1108 coupled to a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer thermo scientific delta v advantage using a

samples were taken at five discrete depths between 2 m and 48 m from the cores of a borehole drilling the pampeano sediments and the arenas puelches formation located in la martona at the upper basin fig 1 the analyses of δ18ocaco3 and δ13ccaco3 were carried out by isotope ratio mass spectrometry irms at the universidad de málaga spain both isotopes deviation values δ are in after the v pdb standard the reported analytical uncertainties were 0 1 for δ18ocaco3 and 0 07 for δ13ccaco3 3 4 modeling different mixing trends between one fresh and diverse saline end members were identified using cl and δ18o data the conceptual models were then verified by hydrogeochemical modeling using br as a proxy of seawater contribution and considering brseawater 67 mg l hem 1985 the br concentration of the fresh groundwater end member frw was set as 0 025 mg l an intermediate value of local rainwater data between 0 013 and 0 035 mg l armengol et al 2020 this value was consistent with measured br values in fresh groundwater samples in the del azul creek basin 0 1 mg l zabala et al 2016 another aquifer system in the buenos aires province with similar lithology and fresh groundwater hydrochemistry than the mras a few chemical reactions were calculated in some mixing models accompanying the physical mixing cationic exchange exc and mineral dissolution precipitation m subscripts exc and m have been used to identify the different models in the text modeling was performed with the code phreeqc using the thermodynamic wateq4f database parkhurst and appelo 1999 and the multiple runs were managed with the software gibbsstudio nardide vries 2017 understanding groundwater mixing processes and the origin of the end members in the mixtures was also supported by including the δ13c and 14c data of tdic the estimation of the most probable isotopic composition of the end members was assessed by systematic runs of geochemical models considering the potential ranges of their δ13c and 14c values the average residence time of the fresh end members was estimated using 3h half life of 12 26 years and 14c half life of 5730 years data 3h was used to support the 14c ages of young and old freshwaters recharging different zones of the puelche aquifer 14c ages t were calculated by international convention as years bp before 1950 ce using a simple function of 14c radioactive decay according to 1 t τ ln2 ln a0 a where τ is the physical half life a0 is the initial activity and a is the present day activity note that for a tracer with exponential decay such as 14c the age of a mixture between young freshwater in our study and old seawater water cannot be computed from the linear weighted mix of the separate tracer ages of both end members as it will create a tracer mixing that is interpreted as older than real mixing tlinear mix fig 4 decay of the mixture between freshwater and seawater must be considered tdecayl otherwise and the uncertainty on the groundwater age increases along with the seawater ratio torgersen et al 2013 for this reason in this work only fresh groundwater end members have been considered for age dating rather than the resulting mixtures of fresh and saline waters in addition we assume that all the saline salt end members have 14c 0 pmc 4 results and discussion the complete set of analytical data is included in tables 1 3 in addition some basic geochemical calculations are also listed in table 1 this section introduces first the identification of the end members in the observed mixing processes second the study of the origin of the three saline end members identified finally the estimation of δ13c and 14c values of the freshwater end members in the mixtures 4 1 identification of mixing processes and end members 4 1 1 fresh water end member groundwater hydrochemistry across the basin showed slightly to highly saline groundwaters in two areas of the puelche aquifer one in the upper basin and the other in the lower basin see fig 3b groundwater at the upper basin was slightly saline ec 2 2 ms cm 1 to 3 8 ms cm 1 and mostly of naca clso4 type while in the lower basin groundwater was moderate to highly saline ec 3 8 ms cm 1 to 55 ms cm 1 and of na cl type following our previous works zabala et al 2016 armengol et al 2017 2020 a unique low mineralized na hco3 type fresh groundwater end member was considered for the mras sample 4p see location in fig 1 was selected as the freshwater end member which consisted of low mineralized 1 2 ms cm 1 na hco3 type groundwater with a δ18o value 5 7 consistent with rainwater in the annual average rainwater δ18o value range for the 2014 2017 period δ18o 3 84 to 6 59 fig 5 4 1 2 saline end members the diverse chemical types and salinities observed in different areas of the puelche aquifer fig 3b were attributed to mixing this fresh end member with saline end members having different compositions the most probable composition of the saline end members was estimated by comparing the cl and δ18o values of the puelche aquifer saline samples and calculating potential mixing trends fig 6 the black line shows the expected mixing trend between a na hco3 freshwater end member frw represented by sample 4p and standard seawater from hem 1985 dashed lines represent theoretical mixing trends between frw and three hypothetical saline end members the upper basin slightly saline end member ubss representing theoretical slightly saline water at the bottom of the puelche aquifer in the upper basin the lower basin highly saline end member lbhs representing theoretical highly saline water at the top of the puelche aquifer and the lower basin hypersaline end member lbhps representing theoretical saline water saltier than seawater at the bottom of the puelche aquifer the fact that the saline end members ubss lbhs and lbhps do not have the cl concentration of seawater is attributed to the different palaeo environments prevailing during the miocene pliocene pleistocene and holocene in the area where the mrrb is located see section 2 1 slightly and highly saline end members ubss and lbhs could be the result of seawater diluted with fresh continental water from shallow coastal areas and or estuaries while the hypersaline end member lbhps could be the result of seawater evaporated in shallow coastal lagoons the probable cl concentration of the ubss end member was assumed to correspond to a δ18o around 8 the probable cl concentration of lbhs was assumed to be somewhere in between the δ18o values of sample 6d and seawater the probable cl concentration of the lbhps end member in fig 6 was determined assuming δ18o 0 despite the implicit uncertainties of the assumed values if different end members had been chosen in the three cases their cl concentration would not have varied much due to the verticality of the curves at the ends thus the following δ18o and cl values have been assumed for the three end members in the upper basin the ubss end member has been characterized by a cl concentration 1000 mg l and a δ18o value 8 this δ18o value is depleted compared to present day recharge water 5 8 in sample 4p frw or 5 1 in local rainwater average for years 2014 2015 armengol et al 2020 provided that there is no topographic gradient in the recharge area it must be assumed to represent recharged in the past colder and or rainier than today time in the lower basin the lbhs end member has been characterized by a cl concentration 7900 mg l and a δ18o 1 to 2 2 was used for calculations also in the lower basin the lbhps end member has been characterized by a cl concentration 42 000 mg l and a δ18o 0 as the origin of the salinity was assumed to be marine transgressions in all cases for modeling purposes the complete chemical composition of each saline end member was estimated using the cl proportion of standard seawater hem 1985 in each saline end member the proportions of seawater were 5 40 and 215 for the ubss lbhs and lbhps end members respectively the remaining 95 and 60 of ubss and lbhs were assumed to correspond to freshwater with a chemical and δ18o composition similar to sample 4p the composition of the lbhps end member was estimated as the result of seawater evaporated 2 15 times table 4 the modeled chemical compositions of those saline end members are in table 4 additionally the analysis of the relationship between the cl br ratio and the cl content was used to assess the origin of groundwater salinity following the work of alcalá and custodio 2008 fig 7 the saline samples have cl br values ranging from 605 to 791 consistent with the typical seawater value 655 4 after alcalá and custodio 2008 the values of the upper basin slightly saline samples and lower basin moderately saline samples groups clearly have the fingerprint of seawater while the lower basin highly saline samples have the signature of marine brines thus the cl br values are therefore in agreement with the marine origin of cl the figure also shows the cl br values of rainwater sampled across the basin which depict the influence of distance to sea 4 2 origin of the upper basin slightly saline end member ubss the upper basin slightly saline samples 2p 12p 17p 18p and 30p belonged to the deepest 50 83 m depth boreholes of the acumar groundwater monitoring network those boreholes were screened at the contact between the arenas puelches and the paraná formations the cl δ18o relationship in fig 6 suggests mixing between the ubss end member and fresh groundwater represented by sample 4p the ubss end member was assumed to be diluted seawater remaining from the marine paraná transgression according to its cl concentration the ubss end member was estimated to be 5 of standard seawater and 95 of old freshwater according to its depleted δ18o value the old freshwater contributing to the ubss end member corresponds to a colder and or rainier than today s climate this assumption was consistent with the environmental context that must have induced the transition from marine to continental conditions at the late miocene which implied a drop of the sea level and a shift to colder conditions and also with the conditions of several other periods of the past geological history of the earth loosli et al 2001 kirchheim et al 2019 this hypothesis is explored in section 5 2 the feasibility of the frw ubss mixing was also supported by comparing the measured chemical composition of the slightly saline mixed samples with the calculated frw ubss mixing all major components were plotted against an increasing br concentration from the freshwater value to the theoretical ubss end member value of 5 mg l fig 6 results in fig 8 uphold that slightly saline groundwaters in the puelche aquifer at the upper basin could be the result of mixing between a freshwater similar to sample 4p and a slightly saline end member with the estimated composition of the ubss as expected the best results were obtained for na and cl fig 8a and b due to their mostly conservative behavior and large concentrations model c and f slightly underestimate their concentrations but good fitting results were still obtained for mg k fig 8e g and hco3 fig 6d however measured ca and so4 concentrations were significantly higher than the modeled ones fig 8c f the thermodynamic conditions of measured samples were favorable for calcite precipitation and gypsum dissolution see si values in table 1 and the presence of both minerals was reported in the paraná formation aceñolaza 2000 marengo 2006 as calcite precipitation and gypsum dissolution were feasible processes they were incorporated into a new model assuming equilibrium model frw ubssm in fig 8 the ca and so4 plots in fig 8c and f suggest that some gypsum dissolution could occur in addition to mixing modeled hco3 concentrations fig 8d suggest that calcite precipitation also took place the fact that ca so4 and hco3 measured values fell in between the ubss and ubssm end members mixing lines indicates that calcite and gypsum dissolution occurs to a minor extent or maybe locally 4 3 origin of the lower basin highly saline end member lbhs the lower basin moderately saline samples 6c 6p and 33p belonged to boreholes screened in the arenas puelches formation and were assumed to be the result of mixing between the frw and the lbhs end members see fig 1 exceptionally sample 6d was from a borehole screened at the postpampeano sediments overlying the arenas puelches formation the chemical similarities among samples 6d 6c 6p and 33p table 1 suggested that their salinity comes from the postpampeano sediments which means from holocene marine water at the lower basin the arenas puelches formation is overlaid directly by the postpampeano sediments while the pampeano sediments are practically absent the postpampeano sediments settled during the holocene transgression a process that eroded the pampeano sediments and deposited fine sediments in low topographic zones such as fluvial valleys and the coastal fringe this explains the location and extent of the postpampeano sediments fig 1 the original marine porewater of the postpampeano sediments has not yet been fully replaced by fresh groundwater due to the low topographic and hydraulic gradients existing in the basin and the reduced permeability of the sediments though diluted those sediments still hold connate marine water this hypothesis was consistent with the estimated cl value of the lbhs end member 7900 mg l which corresponded to present day seawater diluted to 40 table 4 assuming that the δ18o value of the diluting water was similar to the present day groundwater in the puelche aquifer 5 77 the δ18o value of the lbhs end member was estimated as 2 the conceptual model for the origin of the moderately saline samples 6c 6d 6p and 33p was a mixing of the current freshwater of the puelche aquifer frw and the lbhs end member the lbhs end member is in turn seawater diluted by an older freshwater whose chemical composition but not the δ18o one was apparently similar or close to the present day freshwater thus the combination of geology and hydrodynamic conditions could explain the influence of the postpampeano sediments salinity on groundwater of the upper part of the puelche aquifer in the lower basin all the measured values showed evolution patterns consistent with the modeled mixings fig 9 however in some samples the measured and modeled concentrations were slightly different for example samples 6d 6p and 33p showed measured concentrations of na ca and hco3 higher than the modeled ones the same occurred with so4 concentration in samples 6p and 33p and with k in samples 6d and 33p the excess of na and k could be explained by a softening cation exchange process driven by the actual seaward movement of continental freshwater through the postpampeano sediments this cation exchange would produce a deficit of ca and maybe mg which would be compensated by carbonate dissolution indeed the postpampeano sediments are rich in carbonate shells and the calculated mixtures were subsaturated in calcite whereas the measured samples were only slightly subsaturated table 1 two new mixing models checked the feasibility of these processes frw lbsexc accounting for cation exchange and frw lbhsm accounting for both cation exchange and calcite dissolution frw lbhsexc and frw lbhsm in table 4 the cation exchange capacity cec was attributed to the clay fraction composed mainly of montmorillonite gonzález bonorino 1965 assuming a homogeneous presence and mineralogy for clay in the four geological formations of the postpampeano sediments 25 each and considering clay as 13 of the mineral volume in the querandí formation tófalo and etchichury 2005 the clay would account for 3 of the total postpampeano sediments a value of cec 0 19 mol l was obtained attributing the montmorillonite exchange capacity 80 meq 100 g to an average clay fraction of 3 exchange equilibrium constants have been obtained from appelo and postma 2005 following the gaines thomas convention as expected in the frw lbhsexc model ca and mg concentrations decrease and na and k concentrations increase due to cation exchange frw lbhsexc table 4 an additional run was computed accounting for the querandí formation as the only representative formation of the postpampano sediments 100 querandí 13 of clay but no significant changes were obtained the model frw lbhsexc is not plotted in fig 9 because no difference with the model frw lbhs can be appreciated graphically the similarity between the results of both models can be attributed to the high solute concentrations of the samples when calcite dissolution until equilibrium is modeled in addition to cation exchange ph ca and hco3 values increase frw lbhsm model table 4 comparing all models in table 4 the modeled ca na and hco3 concentrations in the frw lbhsm model were closer to the measured ones fig 9c and d therefore cation exchange and calcite dissolution are feasible in addition to mixing in the upper part of the puelche aquifer 4 4 origin of the lower basin hypersaline end member lbhps the lower basin highly saline samples 29p 37p and 6b belonged to boreholes screened at the bottom of the arenas puelches formation just above the contact with the paraná formation fig 1 this group of samples had the highest measured cl values of the entire mras the relationship between cl and δ18o values in fig 6 suggested that they were a mixture of the present day fresh groundwater in the puelche aquifer frw and a hypersaline end member lbhps the estimated salinity of the lbhps end member cllbhs 42 400 mg l was higher than that of standard seawater cllbhs 19 000 mg l the geological locations of the screens were similar to that of the upper basin boreholes and the salinity source was also assumed to be the paraná formation the higher salinity of the lbhps end member compared to the ubss end member was attributed to different paleo sedimentary conditions in both zones several authors iriondo 1973 del río 2000 aceñolaza 2000 marengo 2006 associated the characteristics of the paraná formation sediments near the present day coast with a shallow marine environment characterized by bays and swamps exposed to evaporation consequently the higher salinity of lbhps end member was attributed to a shallow coastal evaporative environment with water 2 15 times more saline than present day seawater satisfactory results were obtained from modeling a conservative mixing of frw and lbhps fig 10 especially for ca hco3 except for sample 29p and so4 however this model had notably overestimated na mg and k concentrations the feasibility of cation exchange occurrence was also checked through model lbhsexc the cec value has been computed by assuming the clay fraction volume at the contact arenas puelches formation paraná formation to represent montmorillonite by 3 30 the base of the arenas puelches is formed mainly by sand and the top of the paraná formation is formed by clay therefore small differences in screen depth could lead to different cec values a 3 of montmorillonite was attributed to samples from boreholes with screens depths close to the arenas puelches formation in comparison 30 of montmorillonite was attributed to boreholes with screens close to the paraná formation clay fractions higher than 30 were not considered as would prevent groundwater flow no significant changes in the modeled solute concentrations were obtained by increasing the bulk cec capacity i e by augmenting montmorillonite from 3 to 30 values of lbhpsex in table 4 correspond to the 3 clay model calcite dissolution was considered jointly with cation exchange frw lbhsm model in fig 10 no significant changes were observed in the ca na mg k cl and so4 concentrations while hco3 fitting was clearly poorer considering calcite dissolution fig 10d and table 4 the absence of significant changes among the mixing models with the lbhps lbhpsex and lbhpsm end members were attributed to the high salinity of the lbhps end member thus for the sake of simplicity water rock interaction was discarded in the frw lbhs conceptual mixing model 4 5 isotopic composition of the fresh end members total dissolved inorganic carbon the isotopic composition of the tdic in the freshwater end members was estimated after establishing each conceptual model tdic isotopic composition gave additional insight into the origin of the end members participating in the mixtures the chemical compositions of the saline end members were calculated following the discussion in section 4 1 the chemical composition of the ubss end member was calculated as a mixing of seawater with old freshwater with similar chemical composition to present day freshwater but with a lighter δ18o composition the model included gypsum dissolution as suggested by the results in section 4 1 a as discussed in section 4 1 b the chemical composition of the lbhs end member could be assimilated to a mixture of seawater and older freshwater with similar chemical and isotopic composition to present day freshwater the best fitting model included cation exchange and calcite dissolution to achieve the measured alkalinity the chemical composition of the lbhps end member was obtained just by evaporating seawater the carbon isotopic values assumed for seawater were δ13c 0 and 14c 0 pmc mook and rozanski 2000 these values assume a negligible contribution of continental discharge with hco3 formed from edaphic co2 dissolution although old and recent freshwaters in the saline mixing waters were assumed chemically equivalent their carbon isotopic values were not necessarily similar as suggested by δ18o in the upper basin and were complex to estimate some approaches could be obtained from the measured values and the mixing proportions indeed any measured value p was the result of three end members mixtures 2 p m n a 1 n b 1 m c where a is the old freshwater isotopic value b is the seawater isotopic value c is the recent freshwater isotopic value n is the fraction of old freshwater in the mixture with seawater and m is the fraction of present day freshwater in the mixture with seawater old freshwater parameters n and m as the isotope values for the old a and recent c freshwater were unknown feasible ranges for the δ13c and 14c values of the freshwater end members were first established the δ13c values were assumed to range from 18 to 0 and the 14c values were assumed to range from 0 to 100 pmc the value δ13c 18 was in between the measured soil organic matter δ13csom 22 table 2 and a value from a previous study in a close area δ13csom 16 zach et al 2006 and represents fresh groundwater with a predominance of edaphic co2 the value 14c 0 pmc represents a fresh groundwater end member incorporated at the groundwater system for at least 50 000 years in contrast 14c 100 pmc represented a recently recharged fresh groundwater as the current atmospheric 14c value is somewhat higher than 100 pmc processes other than mixing with seawater such as calcite dissolution could have influenced the δ13c and 14c values of samples 6c 6p and 33p in the lower basin fig 9d 4 6 a estimated δ13c and 14c values of the fresh groundwater end members in the slightly saline groundwater samples of the upper basin from eq 3 knowing the δ13c and 14c values of p measured and b seawater assumed δ13c 0 and 14c 0 pmc and the mixing proportions of each sample a relationship between the δ13c and 14c values of the old a and the recent c fresh groundwater end members could be established 3 a 1 m n p 1 m m n c the values of m and n are listed in table 5 the value of n is equivalent to 1 frw in table 4 the value of m was obtained by dividing the br concentration of the samples by the br concentration of the end member the calculated δ13c and 14c values of c and a combinations for the upper basin slightly saline samples are shown in fig 11 for δ13c and fig 12 for 14c in fig 11 the straight line was the result of applying eq 3 to the upper basin s five slightly saline samples p with the range of possible values of c the hypothesis that the same old freshwater end member must have participated in the five samples was used to constrain the possible combinations thus the 30p 2p intersection with c values undetermined within the range allowed the narrowing of the δ13c range of the old freshwater end member a from 9 to 3 5 fig 11a including this range on the y axis of fig 11b allowed to establish the possible δ13c value of the recent freshwater around 11 the estimated values of both freshwater end members for each sample have been summarized in table 5 none of the slightly saline samples of the upper basin had measurable tritium concentrations with a 0 2 tu analytical uncertainty table 1 therefore the most recent freshwater end member had more than 50 yr in the groundwater system the projection of the measured 14c values on the y old fresh groundwater end member and x axis recent freshwater end member in fig 12 allowed obtaining an estimated 14c value of both freshwater components for each sample table 5 the measured 14c activities in the slightly saline samples of the upper basin ranged from 21 40 to 60 19 pmc table 1 based on sample 30p the possible 14c values for the old freshwater end member were restricted to a 0 30 pmc range and the most plausible values within this range were those closer to 30 pmc the 14c range for the old freshwater member of sample 2p is 55 85 pmc differing from samples 12p 17p 18p and 30p and being the highest values of this group of samples a reasonable hypothesis was that recent groundwater 100 pmc reached the screen of this piezometer probably induced by pumping consequently sample 2p was excluded from further discussions the projection of the 0 30 pmc range from the y axis on the samples 12p 17p and 18p allowed to establish ranges of 15 35 30 45 and 50 80 pmc for the recent freshwater end member of those samples respectively fig 12b if the hypothesis on piezometer 2p was correct then the old fresh groundwater end member of sample 2p was 50 pmc closer to that of the rest of the ubss samples old fresh groundwater end member corresponded to groundwater recharged between approximately 50 000 yr to 10 000 yr ago for the main part of the samples the recent freshwater end member ranged from 30 to 50 pmc corresponding to groundwater recharged between approximately 10 000 yr and 5000 yr ago the estimated ages for fresh groundwater end members at the upper basin suggested either recharge within the mrrb and very slow vertical transfer to the puelche aquifer or recharge outside the mrrb boundary and lateral transfer within the same aquifer by long regional groundwater flow lines given that the aquitard separating the upper and puelche aquifers was not continuous the second hypothesis was more likely 4 7 eestimated δ13c and 14c values of the fresh groundwater end members in the moderately saline groundwater samples of the lower basin new terms were added to eq 2 to consider calcite dissolution in this zone in eq 4 d refer to the calcite isotope value and p is the proportion of dissolved calcite 4 p p m n a 1 n b 1 m c 1 p d the presence of marine shells in lithological profiles of the lower basin is well documented acumar 2019 thus calcite dissolution was attributed to these marine carbonates assuming δ13ccalcite 0 and 14ccalcite 0 pmc i e d 0 in eq 4 the value of p in eq 4 could be estimated from the difference between the dissolved carbon of the conservative mixing model frw lbhs model and that one of the model dissolving calcite frw lbhsm model or from the ratio among them eq 5 5 p h c o 3 l b s m h c o 3 l b s h c o 3 l b s m 0 5 now the isotopic value of old a and recent c freshwater end members must be twice the estimated value without calcite dissolution eq 3 as half of the total dissolved carbon comes from calcite eq 6 6 a 2 m n p 1 m m n c the possible values of δ13c and 14c in the old a and recent c freshwater end members for the lower basin moderately saline groundwater samples computed by eq 5 were plotted in fig 13 the intersection of the measured δ13c value and the y axis in sample 33p fig 13a was used to constrain the range of δ13c values in the old freshwater end member from 17 3 to 5 5 sample 6d fig 13a was also used for that purpose obtaining a narrower range from 16 5 to 10 finally a recent freshwater end member δ13c value of 3 3 to 3 was established projecting the 16 5 to 9 old freshwater range to the measured value of sample 6c the same projection on sample 6p resulted in a less depleted old freshwater range 5 7 to 5 3 these piezometers had a short depth and were located in an area of intense groundwater withdrawal in the 1970s 1990s furthermore the samples from these piezometers were the only ones with measurable tritium activities 0 1 0 9 0 2 tu table 1 and therefore the only ones in which the recent freshwater end member c has less than 50 yr in the system i e 14c 100 pmc this age was consistent with the results from martinez et al 2017 who estimated by means of cfc groundwater ages for the upper aquifer between 30 and 50 yr in the quequén river basin located some 60 km to the se of the mrrb the 14c values for the old fresh groundwater end member are in table 5 in this case no projection was needed as the value of the recent freshwater end member c was known however the resulting 14c numerical value for all samples was higher than 100 pmc and made physically nonsense a possible explanation was that the current recharge water has a14c activity higher than 100 pmc this hypothesis was supported by data not shown in this paper from a shallow 3 5 m depth piezometer near the río de la plata estuary this shallow piezometer was sampled during the same field survey as the samples discussed here and had 14c 106 pmc the chemical and isotopic composition of this sample suggested infiltration from the río de la plata estuary thus its 14c value must represent present day precipitation in the río de la plata basin considering 106 pmc as the current recharge 14c activity sample 6c 104 pmc and potentially sample 6d 133 pmc had values associated with recently recharged water however the 14c numerical value of sample 6p 605 pmc and sample 33p 211 pmc was still too high one plausible explanation was that other sources of carbon with 14c values 0 pmc were contributing to those samples the poor sewage infrastructures in this highly populated area of buenos aires city could result in anthropogenic pollution therefore in addition to calcite dissolution part of the dissolved carbon in these samples could be the result of the oxidation of organic matter from human waste however further carbon analyses are needed to validate this hypothesis and the source of 14c is currently unknown 4 8 estimated δ13c and 14c values of the fresh groundwater end member in the highly saline groundwater samples of the lower basin the discussion of this group of samples was reduced to the recent freshwater end member because the lbhps end member results from seawater evaporation without mixing with an old freshwater component thus for this end member δ13c 0 and 14c 0 pmc according to eq 3 the estimated δ13c values for the recent freshwater component range from 5 to 18 table 5 the less depleted value corresponded to sample 29p the measured δ13c value of this sample 4 0 table 1 was far less depleted than those of the other two samples 8 2 in sample 6b 9 8 in sample 37p therefore even though the chemical characteristics of sample 29p were well reproduced by the frw lbhps conservative mixing model fig 10 the δ13c depletion seemed to be the result of calcite dissolution this was consistent with the fact that sample 29p was in equilibrium with calcite sicalcite 0 table 1 and its higher hco3 concentration with respect to the other samples table 1 was consistent with calcite dissolution the δ13c values of samples 6b and 37p were in agreement with the frw lbhps mixing model in which any lithological contribution of c was identified indeed the freshwater end member of sample 37p which a high co2 pressure 10 0 9 bar has a δ13c value close to that of edaphic co2 tables 2 and 5 the 14c range for recent freshwater end member corresponded to 3000 yr 900 yr 90 70 pmc suggesting that groundwater was delivered to the bottom of the puelche aquifer in the lower basin from regional flow lines and by lateral instead of vertical transfer as was deduced for the upper basin sector of the puelche aquifer the age differences between groundwater in the upper and the lower basin of the aquifer could be explained by the existence of some young groundwater contribution by vertical flow from the upper aquifer in the lower basin this hypothesis was consistent with the shallower depth 36 50 m of the lower basin piezometers compared to the ones in the upper basin 50 83 m 5 conclusions the groundwater salinization processes occurring in specific areas of the mras has been deduced from the chemical and isotopic study of samples selected from previous works and a large regional database the salinization is the result of mixing between recently recharged freshwater and three different old groundwater saline end members 1 the upper basin slightly saline end member ubss which is proposed to be diluted seawater from the top of the marine paraná formation late miocene age 2 the lower basin highly saline end member lbhs which is proposed to be also diluted seawater related to current freshwater infiltrating to the marine holocene postpampeano sediments and 3 the lower basin hyper saline end member lbhps which is proposed to be evaporated seawater also in the top of the paraná formation to reproduce the chemical composition of the slightly saline mixing groundwaters found in the upper basin the mixing of recent freshwater with ubss end member had to be accompanied by water rock reactions such as gypsum and calcite dissolution calcite dissolution was also needed to achieve the measured alkalinity values of the moderately saline groundwater samples produced by the mixing of recent freshwater and the lbhs end member cation exchange does not seem to be a relevant process influencing any of the three mixing glasses of water although it could be overprinted by the high salinity of the end members the estimated δ13c values for most of the old and recent freshwater end members range from 9 to 3 5 and from 16 5 to 3 for the samples mixed with ubss and lbhs end members respectively which agrees with different degrees of edaphic co2 dissolution these values are in agreement with the measured δ13c values of secondary carbonates and of soil organic matter the most relevant information inferred from the estimated 14c ages is related to travel time differences in the flow paths delivering water to different zones of the puelche aquifer which have been interpreted in terms of groundwater sources groundwater in the upper basin sector of this aquifer takes about a14c half life 5700 yr to reach the zone from the recharge area which suggests the dominance of lateral regional flow lines instead of short vertical flow lines from the upper aquifer hence groundwater in the upper basin area of the puelche aquifer seems to be provided mostly by long regional groundwater flow lines probably lateral flow of groundwater recharged outside the mrrb boundary at the lower basin the time needed for groundwater to reach the top of the puelche aquifer was less than 50 yr which suggests that vertical recharge from the upper aquifer is the main source this process is probably induced by the intense pumping performed in this area for several decades however a time span of 3000 yr 900 yr was required to reach the bottom part of the puelche aquifer in the lower basin suggesting the dominance of lateral versus vertical transfer and pointing again to water transfer from long regional flow lines of groundwater probably recharged outside the mrrb boundary this is the first time that groundwater salinization is modeled by mixing and water rock interaction processes linked to connate saline groundwater from different marine origins in argentina the results showed the signatures of miocene and holocene transgressions into the current groundwater system and the diverse sources of flow paths delivering groundwater to the upper and lower basin sectors of the confined puelche aquifer this approach provided a better understanding of salinization and recharge processes the new knowledge generated can help to understand groundwater salinization processes in other aquifer systems around the world constraining future groundwater salinization models from a management point of view it could help implement better plans to reduce the influence of the salinity and improve the quality of pumped groundwater in different zones of the mras for example controlling the borehole depths reducing pumping flow rates moving the supply wells

11726,groundwater salinization is a severe worldwide issue affecting many coastal aquifers by threatening their freshwater resources werner et al 2013 michael et al 2017 the matanza riachuelo river basin mrrb is a coastal continental basin that supplies fresh water to the greater buenos aires conurbation encompassing approximately 10 of argentina s population among other environmental degradation issues salinization is one of the most important processes affecting the mrrb in this study salinization across the mrrb was unraveled using major cl hco3 so4 na ca mg and tracer br solutes together with stable 18o 2h 13c and radioactive isotopes 3h 14c three different saline end members were identified upper basin slightly saline ubss lower basin highly saline lbhs and lower basin hyper saline lbhps the salinity of the ubss and the lbhps end members was associated with the miocene paraná formation connate marine water while the salinity of the lbhs end member were associated with the pleistocene to holocene postpampeano sediments connate seawater the estimated 14c values were related to travel time differences in the flow paths delivering water to different zones of the puelche aquifer groundwater in the upper basin sector of the puelche aquifer was likely to belong to long regional groundwater flow recharged outside the mrrb boundary groundwater in the top of the puelche aquifer at the lower basin comes from the upper aquifer through vertical transfer this study contributes to a better understanding of 1 salinization processes linked to connate marine water of different ages in the matanza riachuelo aquifer system and 2 different sources of flow paths delivering groundwater to the upper and lower sectors of the confined puelche aquifer the knowledge generated from this study can help to understand groundwater salinization processes in other aquifer systems around the world and support groundwater management plans across the mrrb

the buenos aires metropolitan area supports one third of argentina and is one of the most populated areas in south america the matanza riachuelo aquifer system mras is a coastal continental aquifer system in the matanza riachuelo river basin mrrb north east argentina the mras has been intensively used in the buenos aires area for urban and industrial purposes since the 1970s and had severe quality problems mainly related to nitrate arsenic and salinity while high nitrate concentrations result from anthropogenic activities relatively high arsenic concentrations and groundwater salinization issues result from natural processes the deterioration of air soil surface water ad groundwater quality in the mras became a significant issue for the argentinian government in 2008 that year the alarming contamination conditions of the mrrb led the supreme court of justice of argentina to issue a collective sentence to the matanza riachuelo basin authority acumar the national government the government of the province of buenos aires and the government of the autonomous city of buenos aires the sentence required the issuance of an urgent final and effective decision to improve the quality of life of the local population recover the environment and prevent further damage in advance cafferatta 2009 as a result acumar designed and implemented the integrated environmental sanitation plan plan integral de saneamiento ambiental pisa acumar 2009 and began monitoring groundwater surface water sediments and air the pisa implementation emphasized the need for adequate knowledge of groundwater processes including the hydrogeochemical processes providing groundwater natural characteristics as well as the existing pollution processes and their impact on groundwater quality understanding the origin of groundwater salinization is imperative to evaluate new management strategies once the source of salinity is identified groundwater plans can be implemented to reduce the influence of the salinity source and if possible improve the quality of pumped groundwater the groundwater chemistry of the mras was first reported by unlp 2010 based on a thorough study of the basic chemistry of 135 samples over the entire region aquifer the study was complemented by zabala et al 2016 who established the groundwater chemical baseline by comparing 570 samples from the upper aquifer and 322 samples from the puelche aquifer taken between may 2008 and september 2011 the results showed extensive areas of both aquifers with fresh groundwater and a stable chemical composition for the studied period saline water was only reported in a few areas of the aquifer they also showed that the chemical composition of fresh groundwater in the whole mras resulted from chemical and physical processes occurring primarily after groundwater recharge the primary chemical processes included edaphic co2 dissolution silicate weathering cation exchange and precipitation of secondary minerals evapotranspiration and mixing of fresh and saline groundwater in different zones of the aquifer system were already proposed as the most important physical processes with the second one transforming fresh into slightly saline and salt groundwater the roles of chemical processes and evapotranspiration with particular reference to arsenic were already studied in detail by armengol et al 2017 2020 however the role of mixing processes remained scarcely analyzed up to now the overall objective of this study was to improve the conceptual groundwater quality model in the mras by understanding the origin and occurrence of different salinization processes first the areas with saline water were selected based on the results of more extensive studies in the area described above then chemical and isotope tracers were measured in groundwater from these selected areas second a review of the geological history of the basin was carried out allowing identifying potential salinity origins and a better understanding of the location of saline groundwater in very specific areas of the mras finally hydrogeochemical modeling of conservative and reactive mixing was developed to support the proposed conceptual models and understand the mixing processes occurring in the different selected areas of the system 2 the study area 2 1 geology the mrrb covers an area of 2048 km2 fig 1 the matanza riachuelo river runs across 77 km in the sw ne direction before reaching the río de la plata estuary the mras is made up of several sedimentary units from bottom to top they are the arenas puelches formation the pampeano sediments and the postpampeano sediments the mras develops above the paraná formation a widely extended marine unit fig 1 formed during the middle miocene to lower pliocene representing the youngest tertiary marine transgression regression recorded in the chaco paraná basin fernández garrasino and vrba 2000 the paraná formation lies over the crystalline basement the arenas puelches formation is a large continental unit of plio pleistocene age with a spatial extension of 240 000 km2 auge et al 2002 it is composed mainly of fluvial quartz sands with intercalations of gravels and clays at the bottom and central parts and clays at the top santa cruz 1972 logan and nicholson 1998 in the mrrb the sandy part has a thickness between 13 and 33 m mancino et al 2013 the top clayey layer is not continuous has a variable thickness between 1 and 12 m and thickens to the sw mancino et al 2013 the top of the arenas puelches formation is around 15 m deep to the ne of the mrrb and 63 77 m deep to the sw and it does not crop out in the basin the pampeano sediments is a late pliocene continental unit it extends across 1 m km2 of the 2 8 m km2 of continental argentina and the southern part of paraguay in the mrrb they are formed by two main geological formations ensenada and buenos aires which consist of clays fine sands and silty loess of fluvial lacustrine and eolian environments and have abundant secondary carbonate layers frenguelli 1957 fidalgo 1975 riggi et al 1986 the pampeano sediments crop out across most of the mrrb and their thickness ranges from a few to some 60 m increasing from ne to sw fig 1 the postpampeano sediments are of pleistocene to holocene age they only exist along the río de la plata coastal plain and in the lower reaches of the matanza riachuelo river valley logan and rudolph 1997 auge et al 2002 they are formed by several geological formations luján late pleistocene lower holocene fidalgo et al 1973b 1975 sala 1972 la plata middle to upper holocene frenguelli 1957 la postrera late pleistocene late holocene fidalgo et al 1973a 1975 and querandí holocene cavallotto et al 2005 doering 1882 frenguelli 1957 the four formations are sandy and silty mud of fluvial lacustrine and marsh environments in the mrrb the thickness of the postpampeano sediments ranges from a few to some 30 m decreasing from sw to ne fig 1 partially covering the postpampeano sediments there are recent sandy silty and clayey deposits of eolian and deltaic origin the area where the mrrb is located had experienced several marine transgressions throughout its geological history two of them were more relevant for this work the oldest transgression is known as the entrerriense paranense transgression ept and took place in the middle late miocene generating the paraná formation the most recent transgression occurred during the pleistocene holocene and originated the marine formations of the postpampean sediments the ept was a large scale regional transgression the resulting paraná formation is considered a single unit of marine origin marengo 2006 with facies characteristic of more distal to more proximal environments depending on its location aceñolaza 2000 the paraná sea occupied a vast extension that roughly coincides with the chaco pampean plain a vast plain 1 m km2 extending across central and north argentina and parts of bolivia paraguay uruguay and brasil the paraná formation sediments still held marine water however the bibliographic sources cavallotto et al 2005 logan and nicholson 1998 aceñolaza 2000 marengo 2006 coincided in characterizing the marine facies located in the coastal part of the pampean plain as littoral shallow depth and settled in a hyposaline environment lower salinity than the current sea in the late miocene began a transition from marine to continental conditions and gypsum was deposited in coastal lagoons aceñolaza 2000 marengo 2006 fossils found in the postpampean sediments led violante and parker 1999 and cavallotto and violante 2005 to identify six transgressive and regressive cycles corresponding to glacial and interglacial stages with five corresponding to the plio pleistocene and one to the holocene beilinson et al 2019 the most crucial transgression that occurred during this last cycle formed the querandí formation frenguelli 1957 this formation appears along the coastal plain and lower tract of the alluvial valleys and its sediments hold saline pore water logan and nicholson 1998 2 2 hydrogeology from the hydrogeological point of view the geological units described above form the puelche aquifer the aquitard and the upper aquifer of the mras fig 1 underlying the mras the paraná formation also consists of an aquifer topped by an aquitard however due to its elevated salinity auge et al 2002 mention 3 4 g l under the mrrb it is only exploited locally during water demand peaks for industrial purposes however this hydrogeological feature was essential for studying the salinity sources in the mras the puelche aquifer consists of the lower sandy section of the arenas puelches formation it behaves as a confined aquifer and is the most exploited in the mrrb due to its high transmissivity and usually good quality auge 1986 2004 the dominant conceptual model sets that groundwater recharge takes place at a regional scale in the interfluvial areas from the upper aquifer most notably in the main divide with the salado river basin located to the sw of the mrrb not shown in fig 1 the upper aquifer is formed by the pampeano sediments postpampeano sediments and the most recent sediments overlaying the postpampeano sediments the shallow part of the upper aquifer behaves as a phreatic aquifer while from 30 to 50 m depth it behaves as semiconfined auge et al 2002 the upper aquifer recharges mainly from rainfall however as the basin includes part of buenos aires city conurbation a notable recharge also occurs from the leaking water supply networks septic tanks and stormwater drainage systems due to its lower transmissivity this aquifer is less exploited than the puelche and is mostly for rural and suburban uses the top clayey layer of the arenas puelches formation behaves as an aquitard between the puelche and the upper aquifers but due to its discontinuity and heterogeneity it only plays a role at the local and subregional scale at a regional scale both aquifers show similar piezometric patterns fig 2 a and b with groundwater flowing from sw to ne to the río de la plata estuary the hydraulic connection between the two aquifers is notable in most of the basin as they respond simultaneously to seasonal variations produced by rainwater recharge episodes and dry season drawdowns zabala et al 2016 this is consistent with the discontinuous pattern of the aquitard between both aquifers fig 2c shows a simplified conceptual model of the groundwater balance in the mras for the period 1906 2014 ihlla 2015a for this work the numbers were not as relevant as the concepts the scheme shows that there is a lateral transfer of groundwater from the prolongation of both aquifers to the sw beyond the mrrb border also relevant was the fact that the upper aquifer recharges the puelche aquifer in most of the basin except in the lower basin where groundwater flow was reversed under the natural or close to natural conditions reflected by fig 2c the puelche aquifer was intensively exploited till the 1980s this produced severe piezometric depression cones that inverted the prevailing upward groundwater flow and caused the vertical transfer of pollutants nitrate hydrocarbons from the upper aquifer in the coastal part of the basin this pumping induced the intrusion of holocene marine water that was trapped in the sediments under the río de la plata estuary as a consequence many exploitations were closed and substituted by treated surface water from the río de la plata auge et al 2002 therefore the present day pumping rate of both aquifers is not relevant just around a quarter of the total discharge to the río de la plata and one sixteenth of their discharge to rivers and lagoons 2 3 hydrochemistry groundwater from both aquifers of the mras is mostly fresh ec from 0 6 to 1 5 ms cm 1 and na hco3 type fig 3 these characteristics are the combined result of a short number of processes evapoconcentration edaphic co2 and silicate dissolution cation exchange in volcanic glass calcite precipitation and probable clay formation these processes occur during the transit of recharge water across the unsaturated zone of the upper aquifer and the resulting na hco3 groundwater reaches most of the puelche aquifer without further changes armengol et al 2020 however there are a few zones of both aquifers where there is slight to highly saline groundwater for example in the lower basin area near the río de la plata estuary groundwater is moderately to highly saline and na cl type in both aquifers fig 3 with electrical conductivity values ec 6 to 10 ms cm 1 in the upper aquifer and up to 55 ms cm 1 borehole 37p in fig 3b in the puelche aquifer moreover there is a sector from the upper basin area where groundwater of the puelche aquifer is slightly saline of na so4cl type and with ec 2 to 4 ms cm 1 fig 3b given that saline waters are located in very specific areas of the basin and that since 2000 yr ago the aquifers are not in contact with the sea cavallotto et al 2005 marengo 2006 the existence of saline waters must be the result of fresh na hco3 water mixing with existing saline and or salt groundwater in the sediments of those areas 3 materials and methods data used were major and trace solutes cl hco3 so4 na ca mg br and

analyses six rainwater collectors were designed following the design recommended by the isotopic hydrology laboratory of the international atomic energy agency gröning et al 2012 the collectors were homogeneously distributed throughout the basin fig 1 in october 2014 and the sampling was carried out monthly until september 2017 the samples were accumulated and aliquots from each station were analyzed quarterly table s1 the piezometers sampled in this study were specially built to study the upper aquifer and the lower aquifer of the matanza riachuelo aquifer system and belong to the acumar groundwater network the upper aquifer network consists of 35 piezometers and the lower aquifer network consists of 34 piezometers all of them equipped with short screens located on each aquifer the minimum maximum and average screen length are 1 7 and 6 m respectively nine piezometers 2p 6p 12p 17p 18p 29p 30p 33p and 37p with slightly to high salinity were selected for this study to increase the number of samples acumar under the assessment of ihlla added two sets of five piezometers at different depths near the coast to the existing network with the objective to capture saline groundwater due to the non homogenous distribution of the old marine sediments hosting connate seawater only 3 of 10 piezometers captured moderate saline groundwater 6b 6c 6d and were selected all the mentioned piezometers were sampled in july 2015 for chemical and isotopic determinations fig 1 major chemical components na k ca mg cl and so4 were analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy and flame

samples were taken at five discrete depths between 2 m and 48 m from the cores of a borehole drilling the pampeano sediments and the arenas puelches formation located in la martona at the upper basin

standard the reported analytical uncertainties were 0 1 for δ18ocaco3 and 0 07 for δ13ccaco3 3 4 modeling different mixing trends between one fresh and diverse saline end members were identified using cl and δ18o data the conceptual models were then verified by hydrogeochemical modeling using br as a proxy of seawater contribution and considering brseawater 67 mg l hem 1985 the br concentration of the fresh groundwater end member frw was set as 0 025 mg l an intermediate value of local rainwater data between 0 013 and 0 035 mg l armengol et al 2020 this value was consistent with measured br values in fresh groundwater samples in the del azul creek basin 0 1 mg l zabala et al 2016 another aquifer system in the buenos aires province with similar lithology and fresh groundwater hydrochemistry than the mras a few chemical reactions were calculated in some mixing models accompanying the physical mixing cationic exchange exc and mineral dissolution precipitation m subscripts exc and m have been used to identify the different models in the text modeling was performed with the code phreeqc using the thermodynamic wateq4f database parkhurst and appelo 1999 and the multiple runs were managed with the software gibbsstudio nardide vries 2017 understanding groundwater mixing processes and the origin of the end members in the mixtures was also supported by including the δ13c and 14c data of tdic the estimation of the most probable isotopic composition of the end members was assessed by systematic runs of geochemical models considering the potential ranges of their δ13c and 14c values the average residence time of the fresh end members was estimated using 3h half life of 12 26 years and 14c half life of 5730 years data 3h was used to support the 14c ages of young and old freshwaters recharging different zones of the puelche aquifer 14c ages t were calculated by international convention as years bp before 1950 ce using a simple function of 14c radioactive decay according to 1 t τ ln2 ln a0 a where τ is the physical half life a0 is the initial activity and a is the present day activity note that for a tracer with exponential decay such as 14c the age of a mixture between young freshwater in our study and old seawater water cannot be computed from the linear weighted mix of the separate tracer ages of both end members as it will create a tracer mixing that is interpreted as older than real mixing tlinear mix fig 4 decay of the mixture between freshwater and seawater must be considered tdecayl otherwise and the uncertainty on the groundwater age increases along with the seawater ratio torgersen et al 2013 for this reason in this work only fresh groundwater end members have been considered for age dating rather than the resulting mixtures of fresh and saline waters in addition we assume that all the saline salt end members have 14c 0 pmc 4 results and discussion the complete set of analytical data is included in tables 1 3 in addition some basic geochemical calculations are also listed in table 1 this section introduces first the identification of the end members in the observed mixing processes second the study of the origin of the three saline end members identified finally the estimation of δ13c and 14c values of the freshwater end members in the mixtures 4 1 identification of mixing processes and end members 4 1 1 fresh water end member groundwater hydrochemistry across the basin showed slightly to highly saline groundwaters in two areas of the puelche aquifer one in the upper basin and the other in the lower basin see fig 3b groundwater at the upper basin was slightly saline ec 2 2 ms cm 1 to 3 8 ms cm 1 and mostly of naca clso4 type while in the lower basin groundwater was moderate to highly saline ec 3 8 ms cm 1 to 55 ms cm 1 and of na cl type following our previous works zabala et al 2016 armengol et al 2017 2020 a unique low mineralized na hco3 type fresh groundwater end member was considered for the mras sample 4p see location in fig 1 was selected as the freshwater end member which consisted of low mineralized 1 2 ms cm 1 na hco3 type groundwater with a δ18o value 5 7 consistent with rainwater in the annual average rainwater δ18o value range for the 2014 2017 period δ18o 3 84 to 6 59 fig 5 4 1 2 saline end members the diverse chemical types and salinities observed in different areas of the puelche aquifer fig 3b were attributed to mixing this fresh end member with saline end members having different compositions the most probable composition of the saline end members was estimated by comparing the cl and δ18o values of the puelche aquifer saline samples and calculating potential mixing trends fig 6 the black line shows the expected mixing trend between a na hco3 freshwater end member frw represented by sample 4p and standard seawater from hem 1985 dashed lines represent theoretical mixing trends between frw and three hypothetical saline end members the upper basin slightly saline end member ubss representing theoretical slightly saline water at the bottom of the puelche aquifer in the upper basin the lower basin highly saline end member lbhs representing theoretical highly saline water at the top of the puelche aquifer and the lower basin hypersaline end member lbhps representing theoretical saline water saltier than seawater at the bottom of the puelche aquifer the fact that the saline end members ubss lbhs and lbhps do not have the cl concentration of seawater is attributed to the different palaeo environments prevailing during the miocene pliocene pleistocene and holocene in the area where the mrrb is located see section 2 1 slightly and highly saline end members ubss and lbhs could be the result of seawater diluted with fresh continental water from shallow coastal areas and or estuaries while the hypersaline end member lbhps could be the result of seawater evaporated in shallow coastal lagoons the probable cl concentration of the ubss end member was assumed to correspond to a δ18o around 8 the probable cl concentration of lbhs was assumed to be somewhere in between the δ18o values of sample 6d and seawater the probable cl concentration of the lbhps end member in fig 6 was determined assuming δ18o 0 despite the implicit uncertainties of the assumed values if different end members had been chosen in the three cases their cl concentration would not have varied much due to the verticality of the curves at the ends thus the following δ18o and cl values have been assumed for the three end members in the upper basin the ubss end member has been characterized by a cl concentration 1000 mg l and a δ18o value 8 this δ18o value is depleted compared to present day recharge water 5 8 in sample 4p frw or 5 1 in local rainwater average for years 2014 2015 armengol et al 2020 provided that there is no topographic gradient in the recharge area it must be assumed to represent recharged in the past colder and or rainier than today time in the lower basin the lbhs end member has been characterized by a cl concentration 7900 mg l and a δ18o 1 to 2 2 was used for calculations also in the lower basin the lbhps end member has been characterized by a cl concentration 42 000 mg l and a δ18o 0 as the origin of the salinity was assumed to be marine transgressions in all cases for modeling purposes the complete chemical composition of each saline end member was estimated using the cl proportion of standard seawater hem 1985 in each saline end member the proportions of seawater were 5 40 and 215 for the ubss lbhs and lbhps end members respectively the remaining 95 and 60 of ubss and lbhs were assumed to correspond to freshwater with a chemical and δ18o composition similar to sample 4p the composition of the lbhps end member was estimated as the result of seawater evaporated 2 15 times table 4 the modeled chemical compositions of those saline end members are in table 4 additionally the analysis of the relationship between the cl br ratio and the cl content was used to assess the origin of groundwater salinity following the work of alcalá and custodio 2008 fig 7 the saline samples have cl br values ranging from 605 to 791 consistent with the typical seawater value 655 4 after alcalá and custodio 2008 the values of the upper basin slightly saline samples and lower basin moderately saline samples groups clearly have the fingerprint of seawater while the lower basin highly saline samples have the signature of marine brines thus the cl br values are therefore in agreement with the marine origin of cl the figure also shows the cl br values of rainwater sampled across the basin which depict the influence of distance to sea 4 2 origin of the upper basin slightly saline end member ubss the upper basin slightly saline samples 2p 12p 17p 18p and 30p belonged to the deepest 50 83 m depth boreholes of the acumar groundwater monitoring network those boreholes were screened at the contact between the arenas puelches and the paraná formations the cl δ18o relationship in fig 6 suggests mixing between the ubss end member and fresh groundwater represented by sample 4p the ubss end member was assumed to be diluted seawater remaining from the marine paraná transgression according to its cl concentration the ubss end member was estimated to be 5 of standard seawater and 95 of old freshwater according to its depleted δ18o value the old freshwater contributing to the ubss end member corresponds to a colder and or rainier than today s climate this assumption was consistent with the environmental context that must have induced the transition from marine to continental conditions at the late miocene which implied a drop of the sea level and a shift to colder conditions and also with the conditions of several other periods of the past geological history of the earth loosli et al 2001 kirchheim et al 2019 this hypothesis is explored in section 5 2 the feasibility of the frw ubss mixing was also supported by comparing the measured chemical composition of the slightly saline mixed samples with the calculated frw ubss mixing all major components were plotted against an increasing br concentration from the freshwater value to the theoretical ubss end member value of 5 mg l fig 6 results in fig 8 uphold that slightly saline groundwaters in the puelche aquifer at the upper basin could be the result of mixing between a freshwater similar to sample 4p and a slightly saline end member with the estimated composition of the ubss as expected the best results were obtained for na and cl fig 8a and b due to their mostly conservative behavior and large concentrations model c and f slightly underestimate their concentrations but good fitting results were still obtained for mg k fig 8e g and hco3 fig 6d however measured ca and so4 concentrations were significantly higher than the modeled ones fig 8c f the thermodynamic conditions of measured samples were favorable for calcite precipitation and gypsum dissolution see si values in table 1 and the presence of both minerals was reported in the paraná formation aceñolaza 2000 marengo 2006 as calcite precipitation and gypsum dissolution were feasible processes they were incorporated into a new model assuming equilibrium model frw ubssm in fig 8 the ca and so4 plots in fig 8c and f suggest that some gypsum dissolution could occur in addition to mixing modeled hco3 concentrations fig 8d suggest that calcite precipitation also took place the fact that ca so4 and hco3 measured values fell in between the ubss and ubssm end members mixing lines indicates that calcite and gypsum dissolution occurs to a minor extent or maybe locally 4 3 origin of the lower basin highly saline end member lbhs the lower basin moderately saline samples 6c 6p and 33p belonged to boreholes screened in the arenas puelches formation and were assumed to be the result of mixing between the frw and the lbhs end members see fig 1 exceptionally sample 6d was from a borehole screened at the postpampeano sediments overlying the arenas puelches formation the chemical similarities among samples 6d 6c 6p and 33p table 1 suggested that their salinity comes from the postpampeano sediments which means from holocene marine water at the lower basin the arenas puelches formation is overlaid directly by the postpampeano sediments while the pampeano sediments are practically absent the postpampeano sediments settled during the holocene transgression a process that eroded the pampeano sediments and deposited fine sediments in low topographic zones such as fluvial valleys and the coastal fringe this explains the location and extent of the postpampeano sediments fig 1 the original marine porewater of the postpampeano sediments has not yet been fully replaced by fresh groundwater due to the low topographic and hydraulic gradients existing in the basin and the reduced permeability of the sediments though diluted those sediments still hold connate marine water this hypothesis was consistent with the estimated cl value of the lbhs end member 7900 mg l which corresponded to present day seawater diluted to 40 table 4 assuming that the δ18o value of the diluting water was similar to the present day groundwater in the puelche aquifer 5 77 the δ18o value of the lbhs end member was estimated as 2 the conceptual model for the origin of the moderately saline samples 6c 6d 6p and 33p was a mixing of the current freshwater of the puelche aquifer frw and the lbhs end member the lbhs end member is in turn seawater diluted by an older freshwater whose chemical composition but not the δ18o one was apparently similar or close to the present day freshwater thus the combination of geology and hydrodynamic conditions could explain the influence of the postpampeano sediments salinity on groundwater of the upper part of the puelche aquifer in the lower basin all the measured values showed evolution patterns consistent with the modeled mixings fig 9 however in some samples the measured and modeled concentrations were slightly different for example samples 6d 6p and 33p showed measured concentrations of na ca and hco3 higher than the modeled ones the same occurred with so4 concentration in samples 6p and 33p and with k in samples 6d and 33p the excess of na and k could be explained by a softening cation exchange process driven by the actual seaward movement of continental freshwater through the postpampeano sediments this cation exchange would produce a deficit of ca and maybe mg which would be compensated by carbonate dissolution indeed the postpampeano sediments are rich in carbonate shells and the calculated mixtures were subsaturated in calcite whereas the measured samples were only slightly subsaturated table 1 two new mixing models checked the feasibility of these processes frw lbsexc accounting for cation exchange and frw lbhsm accounting for both cation exchange and calcite dissolution frw lbhsexc and frw lbhsm in table 4 the cation exchange capacity cec was attributed to the clay fraction composed mainly of montmorillonite gonzález bonorino 1965 assuming a homogeneous presence and mineralogy for clay in the four geological formations of the postpampeano sediments 25 each and considering clay as 13 of the mineral volume in the querandí formation tófalo and etchichury 2005 the clay would account for 3 of the total postpampeano sediments a value of cec 0 19 mol l was obtained attributing the montmorillonite exchange capacity 80 meq 100 g to an average clay fraction of 3 exchange equilibrium constants have been obtained from appelo and postma 2005 following the gaines thomas convention as expected in the frw lbhsexc model ca and mg concentrations decrease and na and k concentrations increase due to cation exchange frw lbhsexc table 4 an additional run was computed accounting for the querandí formation as the only representative formation of the postpampano sediments 100 querandí 13 of clay but no significant changes were obtained the model frw lbhsexc is not plotted in fig 9 because no difference with the model frw lbhs can be appreciated graphically the similarity between the results of both models can be attributed to the high solute concentrations of the samples when calcite dissolution until equilibrium is modeled in addition to cation exchange ph ca and hco3 values increase frw lbhsm model table 4 comparing all models in table 4 the modeled ca na and hco3 concentrations in the frw lbhsm model were closer to the measured ones fig 9c and d therefore cation exchange and calcite dissolution are feasible in addition to mixing in the upper part of the puelche aquifer 4 4 origin of the lower basin hypersaline end member lbhps the lower basin highly saline samples 29p 37p and 6b belonged to boreholes screened at the bottom of the arenas puelches formation just above the contact with the paraná formation fig 1 this group of samples had the highest measured cl values of the entire mras the relationship between cl and δ18o values in fig 6 suggested that they were a mixture of the present day fresh groundwater in the puelche aquifer frw and a hypersaline end member lbhps the estimated salinity of the lbhps end member cllbhs 42 400 mg l was higher than that of standard seawater cllbhs 19 000 mg l the geological locations of the screens were similar to that of the upper basin boreholes and the salinity source was also assumed to be the paraná formation the higher salinity of the lbhps end member compared to the ubss end member was attributed to different paleo sedimentary conditions in both zones several authors iriondo 1973 del río 2000 aceñolaza 2000 marengo 2006 associated the characteristics of the paraná formation sediments near the present day coast with a shallow marine environment characterized by bays and swamps exposed to evaporation consequently the higher salinity of lbhps end member was attributed to a shallow coastal evaporative environment with water 2 15 times more saline than present day seawater satisfactory results were obtained from modeling a conservative mixing of frw and lbhps fig 10 especially for ca hco3 except for sample 29p and so4 however this model had notably overestimated na mg and k concentrations the feasibility of cation exchange occurrence was also checked through model lbhsexc the cec value has been computed by assuming the clay fraction volume at the contact arenas puelches formation paraná formation to represent montmorillonite by 3 30 the base of the arenas puelches is formed mainly by sand and the top of the paraná formation is formed by clay therefore small differences in screen depth could lead to different cec values a 3 of montmorillonite was attributed to samples from boreholes with screens depths close to the arenas puelches formation in comparison 30 of montmorillonite was attributed to boreholes with screens close to the paraná formation clay fractions higher than 30 were not considered as would prevent groundwater flow no significant changes in the modeled solute concentrations were obtained by increasing the bulk cec capacity i e by augmenting montmorillonite from 3 to 30 values of lbhpsex in table 4 correspond to the 3 clay model calcite dissolution was considered jointly with cation exchange frw lbhsm model in fig 10 no significant changes were observed in the ca na mg k cl and so4 concentrations while hco3 fitting was clearly poorer considering calcite dissolution fig 10d and table 4 the absence of significant changes among the mixing models with the lbhps lbhpsex and lbhpsm end members were attributed to the high salinity of the lbhps end member thus for the sake of simplicity water rock interaction was discarded in the frw lbhs conceptual mixing model 4 5 isotopic composition of the fresh end members total dissolved inorganic carbon the isotopic composition of the tdic in the freshwater end members was estimated after establishing each conceptual model tdic isotopic composition gave additional insight into the origin of the end members participating in the mixtures the chemical compositions of the saline end members were calculated following the discussion in section 4 1 the chemical composition of the ubss end member was calculated as a mixing of seawater with old freshwater with similar chemical composition to present day freshwater but with a lighter δ18o composition the model included gypsum dissolution as suggested by the results in section 4 1 a as discussed in section 4 1 b the chemical composition of the lbhs end member could be assimilated to a mixture of seawater and older freshwater with similar chemical and isotopic composition to present day freshwater the best fitting model included cation exchange and calcite dissolution to achieve the measured alkalinity the chemical composition of the lbhps end member was obtained just by evaporating seawater the carbon isotopic values assumed for seawater were δ13c 0 and 14c 0 pmc mook and rozanski 2000 these values assume a negligible contribution of continental discharge with hco3 formed from edaphic co2 dissolution although old and recent freshwaters in the saline mixing waters were assumed chemically equivalent their carbon isotopic values were not necessarily similar as suggested by δ18o in the upper basin and were complex to estimate some approaches could be obtained from the measured values and the mixing proportions indeed any measured value p was the result of three end members mixtures 2 p m n a 1 n b 1 m c where a is the old freshwater isotopic value b is the seawater isotopic value c is the recent freshwater isotopic value n is the fraction of old freshwater in the mixture with seawater and m is the fraction of present day freshwater in the mixture with seawater old freshwater parameters n and m as the isotope values for the old a and recent c freshwater were unknown feasible ranges for the δ13c and 14c values of the freshwater end members were first established the δ13c values were assumed to range from 18 to 0 and the 14c values were assumed to range from 0 to 100 pmc the value δ13c 18 was in between the measured soil organic matter δ13csom 22 table 2 and a value from a previous study in a close area δ13csom 16 zach et al 2006 and represents fresh groundwater with a predominance of edaphic co2 the value 14c 0 pmc represents a fresh groundwater end member incorporated at the groundwater system for at least 50 000 years in contrast 14c 100 pmc represented a recently recharged fresh groundwater as the current atmospheric 14c value is somewhat higher than 100 pmc processes other than mixing with seawater such as calcite dissolution could have influenced the δ13c and 14c values of samples 6c 6p and 33p in the lower basin fig 9d 4 6 a estimated δ13c and 14c values of the fresh groundwater end members in the slightly saline groundwater samples of the upper basin from eq 3 knowing the δ13c and 14c values of p measured and b seawater assumed δ13c 0 and 14c 0 pmc and the mixing proportions of each sample a relationship between the δ13c and 14c values of the old a and the recent c fresh groundwater end members could be established 3 a 1 m n p 1 m m n c the values of m and n are listed in table 5 the value of n is equivalent to 1 frw in table 4 the value of m was obtained by dividing the br concentration of the samples by the br concentration of the end member the calculated δ13c and 14c values of c and a combinations for the upper basin slightly saline samples are shown in fig 11 for δ13c and fig 12 for 14c in fig 11 the straight line was the result of applying eq 3 to the upper basin s five slightly saline samples p with the range of possible values of c the hypothesis that the same old freshwater end member must have participated in the five samples was used to constrain the possible combinations thus the 30p 2p intersection with c values undetermined within the range allowed the narrowing of the δ13c range of the old freshwater end member a from 9 to 3 5 fig 11a including this range on the y axis of fig 11b allowed to establish the possible δ13c value of the recent freshwater around 11 the estimated values of both freshwater end members for each sample have been summarized in table 5 none of the slightly saline samples of the upper basin had measurable tritium concentrations with a 0 2 tu analytical uncertainty table 1 therefore the most recent freshwater end member had more than 50 yr in the groundwater system the projection of the measured 14c values on the y old fresh groundwater end member and x axis recent freshwater end member in fig 12 allowed obtaining an estimated 14c value of both freshwater components for each sample table 5 the measured 14c activities in the slightly saline samples of the upper basin ranged from 21 40 to 60 19 pmc table 1 based on sample 30p the possible 14c values for the old freshwater end member were restricted to a 0 30 pmc range and the most plausible values within this range were those closer to 30 pmc the 14c range for the old freshwater member of sample 2p is 55 85 pmc differing from samples 12p 17p 18p and 30p and being the highest values of this group of samples a reasonable hypothesis was that recent groundwater 100 pmc reached the screen of this piezometer probably induced by pumping consequently sample 2p was excluded from further discussions the projection of the 0 30 pmc range from the y axis on the samples 12p 17p and 18p allowed to establish ranges of 15 35 30 45 and 50 80 pmc for the recent freshwater end member of those samples respectively fig 12b if the hypothesis on piezometer 2p was correct then the old fresh groundwater end member of sample 2p was 50 pmc closer to that of the rest of the ubss samples old fresh groundwater end member corresponded to groundwater recharged between approximately 50 000 yr to 10 000 yr ago for the main part of the samples the recent freshwater end member ranged from 30 to 50 pmc corresponding to groundwater recharged between approximately 10 000 yr and 5000 yr ago the estimated ages for fresh groundwater end members at the upper basin suggested either recharge within the mrrb and very slow vertical transfer to the puelche aquifer or recharge outside the mrrb boundary and lateral transfer within the same aquifer by long regional groundwater flow lines given that the aquitard separating the upper and puelche aquifers was not continuous the second hypothesis was more likely 4 7 eestimated δ13c and 14c values of the fresh groundwater end members in the moderately saline groundwater samples of the lower basin new terms were added to eq 2 to consider calcite dissolution in this zone in eq 4 d refer to the calcite isotope value and p is the proportion of dissolved calcite 4 p p m n a 1 n b 1 m c 1 p d the presence of marine shells in lithological profiles of the lower basin is well documented acumar 2019 thus calcite dissolution was attributed to these marine carbonates assuming δ13ccalcite 0 and 14ccalcite 0 pmc i e d 0 in eq 4 the value of p in eq 4 could be estimated from the difference between the dissolved carbon of the conservative mixing model frw lbhs model and that one of the model dissolving calcite frw lbhsm model or from the ratio among them eq 5 5 p h c o 3 l b s m h c o 3 l b s h c o 3 l b s m 0 5 now the isotopic value of old a and recent c freshwater end members must be twice the estimated value without calcite dissolution eq 3 as half of the total dissolved carbon comes from calcite eq 6 6 a 2 m n p 1 m m n c the possible values of δ13c and 14c in the old a and recent c freshwater end members for the lower basin moderately saline groundwater samples computed by eq 5 were plotted in fig 13 the intersection of the measured δ13c value and the y axis in sample 33p fig 13a was used to constrain the range of δ13c values in the old freshwater end member from 17 3 to 5 5 sample 6d fig 13a was also used for that purpose obtaining a narrower range from 16 5 to 10 finally a recent freshwater end member δ13c value of 3 3 to 3 was established projecting the 16 5 to 9 old freshwater range to the measured value of sample 6c the same projection on sample 6p resulted in a less depleted old freshwater range 5 7 to 5 3 these piezometers had a short depth and were located in an area of intense groundwater withdrawal in the 1970s 1990s furthermore the samples from these piezometers were the only ones with measurable tritium activities 0 1 0 9 0 2 tu table 1 and therefore the only ones in which the recent freshwater end member c has less than 50 yr in the system i e 14c 100 pmc this age was consistent with the results from martinez et al 2017 who estimated by means of cfc groundwater ages for the upper aquifer between 30 and 50 yr in the quequén river basin located some 60 km to the se of the mrrb the 14c values for the old fresh groundwater end member are in table 5 in this case no projection was needed as the value of the recent freshwater end member c was known however the resulting 14c numerical value for all samples was higher than 100 pmc and made physically nonsense a possible explanation was that the current recharge water has a14c activity higher than 100 pmc this hypothesis was supported by data not shown in this paper from a shallow 3 5 m depth piezometer near the río de la plata estuary this shallow piezometer was sampled during the same field survey as the samples discussed here and had 14c 106 pmc the chemical and isotopic composition of this sample suggested infiltration from the río de la plata estuary thus its 14c value must represent present day precipitation in the río de la plata basin considering 106 pmc as the current recharge 14c activity sample 6c 104 pmc and potentially sample 6d 133 pmc had values associated with recently recharged water however the 14c numerical value of sample 6p 605 pmc and sample 33p 211 pmc was still too high one plausible explanation was that other sources of carbon with 14c values 0 pmc were contributing to those samples the poor sewage infrastructures in this highly populated area of buenos aires city could result in anthropogenic pollution therefore in addition to calcite dissolution part of the dissolved carbon in these samples could be the result of the oxidation of organic matter from human waste however further carbon analyses are needed to validate this hypothesis and the source of 14c is currently unknown 4 8 estimated δ13c and 14c values of the fresh groundwater end member in the highly saline groundwater samples of the lower basin the discussion of this group of samples was reduced to the recent freshwater end member because the lbhps end member results from seawater evaporation without mixing with an old freshwater component thus for this end member δ13c 0 and 14c 0 pmc according to eq 3 the estimated δ13c values for the recent freshwater component range from 5 to 18 table 5 the less depleted value corresponded to sample 29p the measured δ13c value of this sample 4 0 table 1 was far less depleted than those of the other two samples 8 2 in sample 6b 9 8 in sample 37p therefore even though the chemical characteristics of sample 29p were well reproduced by the frw lbhps conservative mixing model fig 10 the δ13c depletion seemed to be the result of calcite dissolution this was consistent with the fact that sample 29p was in equilibrium with calcite sicalcite 0 table 1 and its higher hco3 concentration with respect to the other samples table 1 was consistent with calcite dissolution the δ13c values of samples 6b and 37p were in agreement with the frw lbhps mixing model in which any lithological contribution of c was identified indeed the freshwater end member of sample 37p which a high co2 pressure 10 0 9 bar has a δ13c value close to that of edaphic co2 tables 2 and 5 the 14c range for recent freshwater end member corresponded to 3000 yr 900 yr 90 70 pmc suggesting that groundwater was delivered to the bottom of the puelche aquifer in the lower basin from regional flow lines and by lateral instead of vertical transfer as was deduced for the upper basin sector of the puelche aquifer the age differences between groundwater in the upper and the lower basin of the aquifer could be explained by the existence of some young groundwater contribution by vertical flow from the upper aquifer in the lower basin this hypothesis was consistent with the shallower depth 36 50 m of the lower basin piezometers compared to the ones in the upper basin 50 83 m 5 conclusions the groundwater salinization processes occurring in specific areas of the mras has been deduced from the chemical and isotopic study of samples selected from previous works and a large regional database the salinization is the result of mixing between recently recharged freshwater and three different old groundwater saline end members 1 the upper basin slightly saline end member ubss which is proposed to be diluted seawater from the top of the marine paraná formation late miocene age 2 the lower basin highly saline end member lbhs which is proposed to be also diluted seawater related to current freshwater infiltrating to the marine holocene postpampeano sediments and 3 the lower basin hyper saline end member lbhps which is proposed to be evaporated seawater also in the top of the paraná formation to reproduce the chemical composition of the slightly saline mixing groundwaters found in the upper basin the mixing of recent freshwater with ubss end member had to be accompanied by water rock reactions such as gypsum and calcite dissolution calcite dissolution was also needed to achieve the measured alkalinity values of the moderately saline groundwater samples produced by the mixing of recent freshwater and the lbhs end member cation exchange does not seem to be a relevant process influencing any of the three mixing glasses of water although it could be overprinted by the high salinity of the end members the estimated δ13c values for most of the old and recent freshwater end members range from 9 to 3 5 and from 16 5 to 3 for the samples mixed with ubss and lbhs end members respectively which agrees with different degrees of edaphic co2 dissolution these values are in agreement with the measured δ13c values of secondary carbonates and of soil organic matter the most relevant information inferred from the estimated 14c ages is related to travel time differences in the flow paths delivering water to different zones of the puelche aquifer which have been interpreted in terms of groundwater sources groundwater in the upper basin sector of this aquifer takes about a14c half life 5700 yr to reach the zone from the recharge area which suggests the dominance of lateral regional flow lines instead of short vertical flow lines from the upper aquifer hence groundwater in the upper basin area of the puelche aquifer seems to be provided mostly by long regional groundwater flow lines probably lateral flow of groundwater recharged outside the mrrb boundary at the lower basin the time needed for groundwater to reach the top of the puelche aquifer was less than 50 yr which suggests that vertical recharge from the upper aquifer is the main source this process is probably induced by the intense pumping performed in this area for several decades however a time span of 3000 yr 900 yr was required to reach the bottom part of the puelche aquifer in the lower basin suggesting the dominance of lateral versus vertical transfer and pointing again to water transfer from long regional flow lines of groundwater probably recharged outside the mrrb boundary this is the first time that groundwater salinization is modeled by mixing and water rock interaction processes linked to connate saline groundwater from different marine origins in argentina the results showed the signatures of miocene and holocene transgressions into the current groundwater system and the diverse sources of flow paths delivering groundwater to the upper and lower basin sectors of the confined puelche aquifer this approach provided a better understanding of salinization and recharge processes the new knowledge generated can help to understand groundwater salinization processes in other aquifer systems around the world constraining future groundwater salinization models from a management point of view it could help implement better plans to reduce the influence of the salinity and improve the quality of pumped groundwater in different zones of the mras for example controlling the borehole depths reducing pumping flow rates moving the supply wells

and is also known as the kingdom of tonga tonga has 171 volcanic limestone sand and mixed islands many uninhabited with agriculture and tourism as primary economic earners tonga is divided into three major islands tongatapu ha apai and vava u the current population of tonga is 105 695 whereas nuku alofa is the capital tongatapu has approximately 259 km2 of total area 31 5 km along its northwest southeast way and 18 5 km along the northeast southwest way babu et al 2018 tonga has ten active volcanoes six on land and four underwater world data 2022 tonga is in the pacific ring of fire which attracts natural disasters and volcano eruptions are one of them on january 15 2022 the hunga tonga huna ha apai volcano erupted in tonga where some nearby islands were covered in volcanic ashes tonga is also vulnerable to cyclones tsunamis earthquakes and droughts the study area for this research is tongatapu 21 14 s 175 25 w shown in fig 1 tongatapu is 65 m above sea level and the aquifers mainly consist of karst type limestone which is very porous white et al 2009 tongatapu s geology and hydrological characteristics include a low lying island of coral reefs and soil layers with cracks or karst macro pores karstification of layers indicates that aquifers are heterogenous and anisotropic with higher hydraulic conductivity in karstified layers moreover lower conductivity can be seen in sandy layers hence spatial variation is higher waterloo and ijzermans 2017 the soil type consists of clay and volcanic ash known as typic argiudoll and hapludoll manu 2000 the natural forest is minimal in tongatapu due to agriculture which amounts to the vegetation on the island groundwater is the primary water source in tonga however tongans also use rain and desalinated water tongatapu has plenty of salinity monitoring boreholes and more than 6000 groundwater supply wells however not all the boreholes and wells are marked in fig 1 the actual locations of the wells that were studied are shown in supplementary fig 1 the data was used from 56 locations in tongatapu and all the locations are marked in supplementary fig 1 the exact names of location the number of wells longitude and latitude of the study area are given in supplementary table 1 moreover from the locations niutoua till haateiho the groundwater data were collected on august 14 2007 and from the locations pae till sia atoutai the groundwater data were collected on august 15 2007 as shown in supplementary table 1 the data was taken from the report compiled by white et al 2009 3 methods this study investigates the salinity concentrations of groundwater samples from some monitoring wells in tongatapu the yearly mean electrical conductivity ec of more than 20 wells was analysed using linear regression and graphical linear trends fit to see the effect of salinity concentrations due to the over abstraction of groundwater from 1965 until 2007 the trend line was also shown to see the type of effect either positive or negative moreover the salinity profiles for the three monitoring wells in mataki eua tongamai 21 15 s 175 23 w wellfield marked in fig 1 were linearly plotted at different depths below the water table the long term rainfall patterns and net recharge rates from 1945 until 2006 were also linearly analysed for nuku alofa 21 14 s 175 20 w in tongatapu linear regression was used to compare tonga s average monthly rain and net recharge the salinity data rainfall patterns and net recharge data were taken from the report compiled by white et al 2009 with the collaboration of the south pacific applied geosciences commission sopac the report can be found using the link https tonga data sprep org system files tongatapu 20groundwater 20vulnerability 20 26 20monitoring 20report 2c 2022sep09 pdf moreover to see the climate change effect in tonga the sea level or tide height data from 1993 to 2020 were linearly plotted against the year the tide height data of nuku alofa was used and it was taken from the national tidal centre bureau of meteorology south australia the data can be found using the link https www psmsl org data obtaining stations 1842 php moreover to strengthen and validate climate change in tonga we also linearly plotted the carbon dioxide co2 emissions in tonga from 1960 to 2018 the data was taken from the world bank and can be accessed using the link https data worldbank org indicator en atm co2e pc end 2018 locations to start 1960 view chart 4 results discussion tonga has minimal water management strategies and the over exploitation of water resources is a significant concern hess 2017 to show the over abstraction and overuse of groundwater in tongatapu the groundwater pumping rates of the mataki eua tongamai wellfield were linearly analysed using the data from 1966 to 2007 the results are shown in fig 2 the results indicate that the pumping rate has increased with a positive slope of 1 23 and an r 2 value of 0 94 indicating a better representation of data the pumping rate and the number of pumps in 2007 were 6 times higher than in 1966 moreover the pumping rate litres second increased by 19 from 1998 till 2007 over abstraction of groundwater poses a possible risk of saltwater intrusions into the freshwater aquifers hence the groundwater salinity trends in tongatapu were analysed using linear trend analysis groundwater salinity trends were determined using the electrical conductivity ec of several wells in tongatapu and the results are shown in fig 3 the results indicate that ec has increased by 58 from the year 1965 with a gradient of 0 022 the average salinity concentrations of all wells indicated the lowest salinity of 353 1 mg l in september 1965 in contrast the highest average salinity concentration of 1040 6 mg l was noted in july 1996 due to the wider time gap the variations are higher moreover the ec values were highest in 1996 and they gradually decreased till 2001 because during that time tonga experienced heavy rainfall which caused severe flooding and increased waterlogged areas due to this there was a sudden decrease in the ec values as shown in fig 3 the annual rainfall patterns in tonga are shown in fig 5 from which we can see that from 1995 to 1996 the rainfall was very low hence the ec has a peak value also from fig 5 we can see that the rainfall from 1996 to 2001 was relatively high gradually reducing the ec values the sea level was high in 1996 and decreased slightly till 2000 as shown in fig 6 the sea level height also affected the ec the increase in ec over the 40 year period depicts the presence of sodium chloride in the groundwater in several wells hence the groundwater can be considered saline in other words there is a possibility of saltwater intrusions into the freshwater aquifers in tonga which makes the water saline since the pumping rates have increased indicating over abstraction by 6 times higher since 1966 there is a good chance of saltwater intrusion in tongan aquifers ayolabi et al 2013 did a case study in nigeria mapping saltwater intrusion swi into coastal aquifers with geophysical and geochemical techniques and reported that swi has encroached into the aquifers contaminating the water the authors also reported that increased ec indicated a positive swi in coastal aquifers moreover dausman and langevin 2005 ferguson and gleeson 2012 and costall et al 2020 also reported that overuse over stress and exploitation of groundwater leads to swi and other environmental complications prusty and farooq 2020 did a review on swi in coastal aquifers in india and reported that due to the increase in population and water demand over abstraction of groundwater frequently leads to swi sip in lal and datta 2019b studied the multi objective groundwater management strategy under uncertainties for sustainable control of saltwater intrusion of the bonriki coastal aquifer 1 37 n 173 15 e in kiribati the authors reported that to minimise the swi pumping rates must be controlled and management models must be developed for optimum groundwater pumping the increase in swi in tongatapu is mainly due to over abstraction triggered by the increasing demand for groundwater due to daily household needs and agricultural use the pumping rate in recent years has increased in the mataki eua tongamai wellfield which supplies the groundwater to most of the people in tongatapu the increase in pumping rates in tonga has increased the electrical conductivity of the groundwater hence the freshwater wells and aquifers have more saline water and the freshwater saltwater interface has moved towards the landward side possibly causing saltwater intrusion moreover the data from three salinity monitoring boreholes in tongatapu namely smb1 smb2 and smb3 were also analysed and the results are shown in fig 4 as the depth below the water table increases the salinity level also increases for all three monitoring boreholes moreover 14 m below the water table ec drastically increases indicating higher salinity concentrations a thorough review of how the water table ec and salinity concentrations are linked is given by rusydi 2018 bloomfield et al 2020 studied characterising variations in the salinity of deep groundwater systems and reported that the deeper we go below the water table the more saline groundwater becomes the authors also reported that total dissolved solids tds vary about five orders of magnitude increasing mineralisation with depth hence the results from this study indicate that all the monitoring boreholes had higher salinity concentrations below the water table it can be seen that over abstraction and swi are related however if the aquifers receive a good amount of recharge through rainfall the freshwater saltwater interface will move towards the seaward side therefore the long term rainfall and recharge patterns in tongatapu were linearly analysed the long term rainfall patterns for nuku alofa in tongatapu were linearly analysed the results are shown in fig 5 the results indicate that the monthly mean rainfall has decreased by 19 from 1950 to 2006 the decrease in rainfall could be due to many factors however global warming caused by climate change could be one of the prominent factors for nuku alofa s decreased rainfall c2es 2022 reported that some climate models show a decrease in rainfall with increased dry periods in tonga due to this decreased rainfall the net recharge has also decreased by 37 from 1950 to 2006 as shown in fig 5 the decrease in rainfall will impact the groundwater s net recharge owuor et al 2016 tongatapu island in general has decreased net recharge due to decreased long term rainfall and the possibility of increased evaporation and transpiration linked with climate change and increased atmospheric heat dore 2005 climate change can also be validated if the sea level rises the strength and frequency of tropical cyclone occurrence and increased carbon dioxide emission co2 tonga is experiencing a sea level rise of 6 mm year mulhern 2020 and the severity and frequency of tropical cyclone occurrence in the past few years meidecc 2021 the sea level rise can pose a vertical inundation of swi into the coastal aquifers the sea level or tide gauge height data for nuku alofa was linearly analysed from 1993 to 2020 and the results are shown in fig 6 sea level data was analysed to validate the plausible climate change occurrence in tonga the results indicate that the sea level has increased from 1993 to 2020 by 5 2 sea level rise is one of the major effects of climate change mimura 2013 treanor and watson 2015 reported that tonga is facing sea level rise due to climate change the rise in sea level also affects the water quality and increases water contaminations like swi werner and simmons 2009 studied the impact of sea level rise on swi in coastal aquifers and reported that sea level rise affects the groundwater quality jasechko et al 2020 studied the groundwater level observations in 250 000 coastal u s wells and reported that rising sea levels land subsidence and increased water demands would cause frequent swi into the aquifers hence the increased sea level in nuku alofa must have caused vertical inundation of saltwater into the aquifers contaminating the freshwater co2 also plays a vital role in climate change pastor and post 1988 lindsey 2020 the increased co2 emissions in tonga have led to climate variability and climate change which has increased the sea level rise and eventually contaminated the coastal aquifers in tongatapu and nearby areas the co2 emissions in tonga fiji papua new guinea png and samoa have increased from 1960 to 2018 as shown in fig 7 co2 emission in tonga alone has increased by 800 since 1960 moreover there was a slight increase in co2 by 5 9 from 2017 to 2018 excessive co2 in the atmosphere can also be absorbed into groundwater affecting the water quality carroll et al 2009 oviedo vargas et al 2015 however other studies also suggest that depleting groundwater releases co2 into the atmosphere e g macpherson 2009 wood and hyndman 2017 mishra et al 2018 these studies have revealed that over abstraction of groundwater changes the water s ph level and significantly reduces the bicarbonate level releasing the stored co2 into the atmosphere the link between groundwater over abstraction and co2 released into the atmosphere must be further developed and studied for tonga and other pics the water quality in tonga has been affected by natural and anthropogenic factors over abstraction decreased long term rainfall rates decreased net recharge rising sea level and increased co2 emissions contaminated the groundwater and caused possible saltwater encroachment in tongatapu the limitations of this case study were the availability of quality groundwater data the majority of the pics do not have quality and accessible groundwater data to better understand the groundwater contaminations we need hourly or daily groundwater pumping and salinity data also there is a need to separate other tds from the groundwater to see the actual presence of salinity however to better understand the swi in the coastal aquifers of tongatapu there is a need for 3 d modelling ai based modelling and decision models to manage and prevent saltwater intrusions using these modelling techniques will clearly indicate the presence of swis and provide better groundwater management strategies for controlling swis 5 conclusion the effect of climate change and freshwater over abstraction on groundwater resources in tonga has been analysed using quantitative data linear regression and linear trend analysis water salinity concentrations pumping rates long term rainfall and net recharge sea level and carbon dioxide co2 emission data were used to see the climate change effect and how over abstraction of freshwater affects the groundwater resources due to increasing demands the over abstraction and pumping rates of groundwater in tongatapu have significantly increased moreover the salinity concentrations of several wells in tongatapu have increased for a 42 year period the long term rainfall and net recharge of coastal aquifers in tongatapu have decreased for a 61 year period net recharge of the coastal aquifer has decreased predominantly due to a long term decrease in rainfall and increased heat in the atmosphere caused by excess co2 emissions leading to evaporation and transpiration moreover an increase in sea level has caused vertical inundation of saltwater into the aquifers contaminating the freshwater in tongatapu co2 emissions have significantly increased in tonga threatening the groundwater quality moreover to find how the over abstraction or depleting of groundwater releases co2 emissions into the atmosphere are related a further study must be conducted in tonga and other pacific island countries as these issues have not been addressed adequately or rigorously till now in addition 3 d and ai based modelling studies are needed to better understand the saltwater intrusion in tongan aquifers this study provides insight into how natural and anthropogenic factors affect the groundwater in tonga also this study will benefit the people of tonga and the broader scientific community in planning and

and is also known as the kingdom of tonga tonga has 171 volcanic limestone sand and mixed islands many uninhabited with agriculture and tourism as primary economic earners tonga is divided into three major islands tongatapu ha apai and vava u the current population of tonga is 105 695 whereas nuku alofa is the capital tongatapu has approximately 259 km2 of total area 31 5 km along its northwest southeast way and 18 5 km along the northeast southwest way babu et al 2018 tonga has ten active volcanoes six on land and four underwater world data 2022 tonga is in the pacific ring of fire which attracts natural disasters and volcano eruptions are one of them on january 15 2022 the hunga tonga huna ha apai volcano erupted in tonga where some nearby islands were covered in volcanic ashes tonga is also vulnerable to cyclones tsunamis earthquakes and droughts the study area for this research is tongatapu 21 14 s 175 25 w shown in fig 1 tongatapu is 65 m above sea level and the aquifers mainly consist of karst type limestone which is very porous white et al 2009 tongatapu s geology and hydrological characteristics include a low lying island of coral reefs and soil layers with cracks or karst macro pores karstification of layers indicates that aquifers are heterogenous and anisotropic with higher hydraulic conductivity in karstified layers moreover lower conductivity can be seen in sandy layers hence spatial variation is higher waterloo and ijzermans 2017 the soil type consists of clay and volcanic ash known as typic argiudoll and hapludoll manu 2000 the natural forest is minimal in tongatapu due to agriculture which amounts to the vegetation on the island groundwater is the primary water source in tonga however tongans also use rain and desalinated water tongatapu has plenty of salinity monitoring boreholes and more than 6000 groundwater supply wells however not all the boreholes and wells are marked in fig 1 the actual locations of the wells that were studied are shown in supplementary fig 1 the data was used from 56 locations in tongatapu and all the locations are marked in supplementary fig 1 the exact names of location the number of wells longitude and latitude of the study area are given in supplementary table 1 moreover from the locations niutoua till haateiho the groundwater data were collected on august 14 2007 and from the locations pae till sia atoutai the groundwater data were collected on august 15 2007 as shown in supplementary table 1 the data was taken from the report compiled by white et al 2009 3 methods this study investigates the salinity concentrations of groundwater samples from some monitoring wells in tongatapu the yearly mean electrical conductivity ec of more than 20 wells was analysed using linear regression and graphical linear trends fit to see the effect of salinity concentrations due to the over abstraction of groundwater from 1965 until 2007 the trend line was also shown to see the type of effect either positive or negative moreover the salinity profiles for the three monitoring wells in mataki eua tongamai 21 15 s 175 23 w wellfield marked in fig 1 were linearly plotted at different depths below the water table the long term rainfall patterns and net recharge rates from 1945 until 2006 were also linearly analysed for nuku alofa 21 14 s 175 20 w in tongatapu linear regression was used to compare tonga s average monthly rain and net recharge the salinity data rainfall patterns and net recharge data were taken from the report compiled by white et al 2009 with the collaboration of the south pacific applied geosciences commission sopac the report can be found using the link https tonga data sprep org system files tongatapu 20groundwater 20vulnerability 20 26 20monitoring 20report 2c 2022sep09 pdf moreover to see the climate change effect in tonga the sea level or tide height data from 1993 to 2020 were linearly plotted against the year the tide height data of nuku alofa was used and it was taken from the national tidal centre bureau of meteorology south australia the data can be found using the link https www psmsl org data obtaining stations 1842 php moreover to strengthen and validate climate change in tonga we also linearly plotted the carbon dioxide co2 emissions in tonga from 1960 to 2018 the data was taken from the world bank and can be accessed using the link https data worldbank org indicator en atm co2e pc end 2018 locations to start 1960 view chart 4 results discussion tonga has minimal water management strategies and the over exploitation of water resources is a significant concern hess 2017 to show the over abstraction and overuse of groundwater in tongatapu the groundwater pumping rates of the mataki eua tongamai wellfield were linearly analysed using the data from 1966 to 2007 the results are shown in fig 2 the results indicate that the pumping rate has increased with a positive slope of 1 23 and an r 2 value of 0 94 indicating a better representation of data the pumping rate and the number of pumps in 2007 were 6 times higher than in 1966 moreover the pumping rate litres second increased by 19 from 1998 till 2007 over abstraction of groundwater poses a possible risk of saltwater intrusions into the freshwater aquifers hence the groundwater salinity trends in tongatapu were analysed using linear trend analysis groundwater salinity trends were determined using the electrical conductivity ec of several wells in tongatapu and the results are shown in fig 3 the results indicate that ec has increased by 58 from the year 1965 with a gradient of 0 022 the average salinity concentrations of all wells indicated the lowest salinity of 353 1 mg l in september 1965 in contrast the highest average salinity concentration of 1040 6 mg l was noted in july 1996 due to the wider time gap the variations are higher moreover the ec values were highest in 1996 and they gradually decreased till 2001 because during that time tonga experienced heavy rainfall which caused severe flooding and increased waterlogged areas due to this there was a sudden decrease in the ec values as shown in fig 3 the annual rainfall patterns in tonga are shown in fig 5 from which we can see that from 1995 to 1996 the rainfall was very low hence the ec has a peak value also from fig 5 we can see that the rainfall from 1996 to 2001 was relatively high gradually reducing the ec values the sea level was high in 1996 and decreased slightly till 2000 as shown in fig 6 the sea level height also affected the ec the increase in ec over the 40 year period depicts the presence of sodium chloride in the groundwater in several wells hence the groundwater can be considered saline in other words there is a possibility of saltwater intrusions into the freshwater aquifers in tonga which makes the water saline since the pumping rates have increased indicating over abstraction by 6 times higher since 1966 there is a good chance of saltwater intrusion in tongan aquifers ayolabi et al 2013 did a case study in nigeria mapping saltwater intrusion swi into coastal aquifers with geophysical and geochemical techniques and reported that swi has encroached into the aquifers contaminating the water the authors also reported that increased ec indicated a positive swi in coastal aquifers moreover dausman and langevin 2005 ferguson and gleeson 2012 and costall et al 2020 also reported that overuse over stress and exploitation of groundwater leads to swi and other environmental complications prusty and farooq 2020 did a review on swi in coastal aquifers in india and reported that due to the increase in population and water demand over abstraction of groundwater frequently leads to swi sip in lal and datta 2019b studied the multi objective groundwater management strategy under uncertainties for sustainable control of saltwater intrusion of the bonriki coastal aquifer 1 37 n 173 15 e in kiribati the authors reported that to minimise the swi pumping rates must be controlled and management models must be developed for optimum groundwater pumping the increase in swi in tongatapu is mainly due to over abstraction triggered by the increasing demand for groundwater due to daily household needs and agricultural use the pumping rate in recent years has increased in the mataki eua tongamai wellfield which supplies the groundwater to most of the people in tongatapu the increase in pumping rates in tonga has increased the electrical conductivity of the groundwater hence the freshwater wells and aquifers have more saline water and the freshwater saltwater interface has moved towards the landward side possibly causing saltwater intrusion moreover the data from three salinity monitoring boreholes in tongatapu namely smb1 smb2 and smb3 were also analysed and the results are shown in fig 4 as the depth below the water table increases the salinity level also increases for all three monitoring boreholes moreover 14 m below the water table ec drastically increases indicating higher salinity concentrations a thorough review of how the water table ec and salinity concentrations are linked is given by rusydi 2018 bloomfield et al 2020 studied characterising variations in the salinity of deep groundwater systems and reported that the deeper we go below the water table the more saline groundwater becomes the authors also reported that total dissolved solids tds vary about five orders of magnitude increasing mineralisation with depth hence the results from this study indicate that all the monitoring boreholes had higher salinity concentrations below the water table it can be seen that over abstraction and swi are related however if the aquifers receive a good amount of recharge through rainfall the freshwater saltwater interface will move towards the seaward side therefore the long term rainfall and recharge patterns in tongatapu were linearly analysed the long term rainfall patterns for nuku alofa in tongatapu were linearly analysed the results are shown in fig 5 the results indicate that the monthly mean rainfall has decreased by 19 from 1950 to 2006 the decrease in rainfall could be due to many factors however global warming caused by climate change could be one of the prominent factors for nuku alofa s decreased rainfall c2es 2022 reported that some climate models show a decrease in rainfall with increased dry periods in tonga due to this decreased rainfall the net recharge has also decreased by 37 from 1950 to 2006 as shown in fig 5 the decrease in rainfall will impact the groundwater s net recharge owuor et al 2016 tongatapu island in general has decreased net recharge due to decreased long term rainfall and the possibility of increased evaporation and transpiration linked with climate change and increased atmospheric heat dore 2005 climate change can also be validated if the sea level rises the strength and frequency of tropical cyclone occurrence and increased carbon dioxide emission co2 tonga is experiencing a sea level rise of 6 mm year mulhern 2020 and the severity and frequency of tropical cyclone occurrence in the past few years meidecc 2021 the sea level rise can pose a vertical inundation of swi into the coastal aquifers the sea level or tide gauge height data for nuku alofa was linearly analysed from 1993 to 2020 and the results are shown in fig 6 sea level data was analysed to validate the plausible climate change occurrence in tonga the results indicate that the sea level has increased from 1993 to 2020 by 5 2 sea level rise is one of the major effects of climate change mimura 2013 treanor and watson 2015 reported that tonga is facing sea level rise due to climate change the rise in sea level also affects the water quality and increases water contaminations like swi werner and simmons 2009 studied the impact of sea level rise on swi in coastal aquifers and reported that sea level rise affects the groundwater quality jasechko et al 2020 studied the groundwater level observations in 250 000 coastal u s wells and reported that rising sea levels land subsidence and increased water demands would cause frequent swi into the aquifers hence the increased sea level in nuku alofa must have caused vertical inundation of saltwater into the aquifers contaminating the freshwater co2 also plays a vital role in climate change pastor and post 1988 lindsey 2020 the increased co2 emissions in tonga have led to climate variability and climate change which has increased the sea level rise and eventually contaminated the coastal aquifers in tongatapu and nearby areas the co2 emissions in tonga fiji papua new guinea png and samoa have increased from 1960 to 2018 as shown in fig 7 co2 emission in tonga alone has increased by 800 since 1960 moreover there was a slight increase in co2 by 5 9 from 2017 to 2018 excessive co2 in the atmosphere can also be absorbed into groundwater affecting the water quality carroll et al 2009 oviedo vargas et al 2015 however other studies also suggest that depleting groundwater releases co2 into the atmosphere e g macpherson 2009 wood and hyndman 2017 mishra et al 2018 these studies have revealed that over abstraction of groundwater changes the water s ph level and significantly reduces the bicarbonate level releasing the stored co2 into the atmosphere the link between groundwater over abstraction and co2 released into the atmosphere must be further developed and studied for tonga and other pics the water quality in tonga has been affected by natural and anthropogenic factors over abstraction decreased long term rainfall rates decreased net recharge rising sea level and increased co2 emissions contaminated the groundwater and caused possible saltwater encroachment in tongatapu the limitations of this case study were the availability of quality groundwater data the majority of the pics do not have quality and accessible groundwater data to better understand the groundwater contaminations we need hourly or daily groundwater pumping and salinity data also there is a need to separate other tds from the groundwater to see the actual presence of salinity however to better understand the swi in the coastal aquifers of tongatapu there is a need for 3 d modelling ai based modelling and decision models to manage and prevent saltwater intrusions using these modelling techniques will clearly indicate the presence of swis and provide better groundwater management strategies for controlling swis 5 conclusion the effect of climate change and freshwater over abstraction on groundwater resources in tonga has been analysed using quantitative data linear regression and linear trend analysis water salinity concentrations pumping rates long term rainfall and net recharge sea level and carbon dioxide co2 emission data were used to see the climate change effect and how over abstraction of freshwater affects the groundwater resources due to increasing demands the over abstraction and pumping rates of groundwater in tongatapu have significantly increased moreover the salinity concentrations of several wells in tongatapu have increased for a 42 year period the long term rainfall and net recharge of coastal aquifers in tongatapu have decreased for a 61 year period net recharge of the coastal aquifer has decreased predominantly due to a long term decrease in rainfall and increased heat in the atmosphere caused by excess co2 emissions leading to evaporation and transpiration moreover an increase in sea level has caused vertical inundation of saltwater into the aquifers contaminating the freshwater in tongatapu co2 emissions have significantly increased in tonga threatening the groundwater quality moreover to find how the over abstraction or depleting of groundwater releases co2 emissions into the atmosphere are related a further study must be conducted in tonga and other pacific island countries as these issues have not been addressed adequately or rigorously till now in addition 3 d and ai based modelling studies are needed to better understand the saltwater intrusion in tongan aquifers this study provides insight into how natural and anthropogenic factors affect the groundwater in tonga also this study will benefit the people of tonga and the broader scientific community in planning and

water exchange substantial seasonal variations of the content of dissolved inorganic carbon dic are detected the range of δ13cdic in the analyzed samples from 14 3 to 9 0 corresponds to a mixed co2 origin diffusion of soil co2 approaching the atmospheric δ13cco2 values and biogenic co2 released by decaying plant residues the measured isotope characteristics provide evidence that the waters recharge by infiltration from meteoric sources the approximate radiocarbon age of dic in the tulinka waters determined for the first time is 2663 144 years however this age may be underestimated due

district of novosibirsk within the area of city clinics 34 no 18 titov street the history of the spa began in 1978 when a team from the vostokburvod company drilled a 70 m long test borehole bh 100e two more boreholes were drilled in 1985 151 4 and 151 5 m deep boreholes 1 44 and 2 45 respectively in response to increasing demand for therapeutic radon waters which reached 150 m3 day test and experimental water withdrawal from the boreholes was performed in 1986 1987 by the novosibirsk geological survey the results of tests were used to estimate the radon water resources of c1 category at the tulinka aquifers which amounted to 207 m3 day currently borehole no 10 213 is the only operating borehole for radon water withdrawn from the depth of 70 m 3 hydrogeological setting the tulinka radon water occurrence is located in the trans ob plain which has a rough surface with the incised ob river valley and its terrace iii at elevations of 135 140 m there are two main aquifers within the novosibirsk granite intrusion εγp3 t1p2 buried under cenozoic sediments fig 2 the upper aquifer consists of pore waters in quaternary sediments holocene a3qiv alluvium and the krasnaya dubrovka l lai iikd and kochkovo a le2kč formations and the lower aquifer comprises interstitial waters in sheared granitoids the main phase of the novosibirsk complex babin et al 2015 the rocks of the upper aquifer include silt clay silt and fine sand varying in total thickness from 28 to 43 8 m the waters of the lower aquifer are hosted by sheared yellowish grayish medium grained biotite hornblende porphyry granites the granitic rocks have been cored till the maximum depth of borehole 2 45 111 5 m the rocks are cut by two fracture systems oriented at 20 30о and 50 60о respectively relative to the core

initial anthropogenic pollution caused by flooding of the quaternary sediments and the fractured granites the same process was revealed at the kamenka occurrence located on the right bank of the ob river in the novosibirsk urban area novikov et al 2021a the isotope and chemical data for the tulinka aquifers exposed to flooding were compared with those for other water groups of the area fig 3

222rn activity in the tulinka waters varies from 173 to 276 bq l which corresponds to very low or low radon waters in the classification of tolstikhin posokhov and tolstikhin 1977 the total α and β activity levels do not exceed 891 mbq l and 80 mbq l respectively natural radionuclides are 0 015 0 017 mg l238u and 4 93 10 10 mg l226ra table 2 the concentrations of thorium analyzed for the first time in the groundwater of tulinka aquifers vary from 9 59 10 7 to 1 58 10 5 mg l232th since the times of v vernadsky 1920s 1930s the concentrations of th and its progenies in water have been considered to be below detection limits vernadsky considered thorium to be beyond water chemistry and beyond the earth s water budget in our case the 232th 238u ratio is within the range expectable for oxidized environments 5 81 10 5 to 9 42 10 4 the activities of u and ra isotopes in the tulinka waters are 706 mbq l for 234u 196 mbq l for 238u 18 mbq l for 226ra and 20 mbq l for 228ra and the isotope ratio 234u 238u γ is within 3 6 this confirms the previous hypothesis of their mixing with the waters of the flooded zone for comparison 222rn in the waters of background composition svyatoi spring in verkh tula village ranges from 7 to 28 bq l the total activity α is 327 mbq l and β activity is 20 mbq l other radionuclides are 0 005 0 007 mg l238u 3 01 10 7 to 8 00 10 6 mg l232th and 2 46 10 10 mg l226ra the 232th 238u ratio ranges from 6 38 10 5 to 4 29 10 3 note that the 238u and 232th concentrations in the waters from the boreholes in verkh tula village are lower than in the spring 3 80 10 6 and 8 00 10 6 mg l respectively while the 232th 238u ratio reaches 1 84 to 2 96 the activity values of u and ra isotopes in the svyatoi spring are 147 mbq l234u 115 mbq l238u 9 mbq l226ra and 7 mbq l228ra the 234u 238u ratio γ does not exceed 1 3 which means a minor contribution from deep waters because the 234u 238u ratio is known to serve as an indirect indicator of the contribution from deep waters into an aquifer osmond and rydell 1968 the analyzed waters mainly occur in oxidized conditions and uranium has the highest mobility its distribution correlates with water chemistry of the four groups fig 5 u concentrations are the highest in the tulinka waters 1 48 10 2 to 1 73 10 2 mg l and quite high in the flooded granite quarries 9 80 10 3 to 1 24 10 2 mg l it should be stressed that the waters of the upper tula river contain 1 71 10 2 mg l u approaching the concentration of uranium in radon rich water table 2 fig 5 which requires further investigation 4 3 stable isotopes and dic determination of stable isotopes δ18o δd and δ13c and dissolved inorganic carbon dic in groundwater has become indispensable in studies focused on the genesis of natural waters

2019 santucci et al 2019 stefánsson et al 2019 yu et al 2019 aydin et al 2020 newman et al 2020 surface waters as well as a large part of groundwaters have meteoric sources boral et al 2019 cotovicz et al 2019 santucci et al 2019 wu et al 2019 aydin et al 2020 xia et al 2020 novikov et al 2021b the dic and δ13cdic patterns provide some evidence of the interaction of waters with host rocks zhang et al 1995 cartwright et al 2000 górka et al 2011 mickler et al 2019 novikov et al 2021b and hence of the availability properties and origin of carbon atmospheric organic or biogenic co2 etc the tulinka waters show broad ranges of δ18o and δd 18 9 to 9 5 and 139 4 to 86 1 respectively table 3 fig 6 most of the data plot along the global craig 1961 and local novikov et al 2022 meteoric water lines gmwl and lmwl respectively and are thus of meteoric origin however some samples stand apart from the gmwl and lmwl trends red ellipse in fig 6а due to evaporation leading to heavier isotope values chafouq et al 2018 wu et al 2019 yu et al 2019 newman et al 2020 the δ18o shifts with respect to gmwl are listed in table 3 the local evaporation line approaches the one reported previously novikov et al 2022 for the northern novosibirsk region with the respective equations y 5 2x 38 1 and y 5 2x 37 7 where y is δd and x is δ18o the groundwater sampled from the svyatoi spring borehole 1 in verkh tula village and the tula river site 10 in fig 1 have the most depleted hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions from 139 4 to 134 9 δd and 18 9 to 8 2 δ18o other tula river samples 7 8 9 and 11 in fig 1 and those from the other borehole of verkh tula village show heavier isotope compositions of 131 1 to 122 6 δd and 16 9 to 16 2 δ18o the average δ18o and δd values in the tulinka waters are still less negative 15 3 and 113 7 respectively and vary from 15 5 to 14 8 δ18o and 114 2 to 112 8 δd exhibiting seasonal variations the samples from the shallow and slow upper tula river have the heaviest oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions among the analyzed river waters up to 13 2 δ18o and 105 0 δd due to greater evaporation novikov et al 2020b which led to a positive δ18o shift of 1 2 the waters of the gorsky and tulinka flooded quarries differ from all other water samples by the least negative δ18o and δd values 12 4 and 9 5 δ18o 103 2 and 86 1 δd respectively and the greatest δ18o shifts of 1 8 2 6 which is the evidence of evaporation effect most strongly pronounced in the quarries thus the oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions of the tulinka radon waters are heavier than in most of surface and ground svyatoi spring waters in the summer season δ18o and δd in groundwaters are commonly lighter than in surface waters recharging mostly from rainfall and being subject to evapotranspiration this pattern appears in the samples from the svyatoi spring which can be considered as background groundwaters in terms of oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions meanwhile the δ18o and δd values of the tulinka samples heavier than those of surface waters provide implicit evidence that the aquifers feed from sources related neither to the rivers nor to the svyatoi spring note that δ18o and δd in the tulinka waters as well as in the svyatoi spring are poorly sensitive to seasonal effects and thus represent a zone of slow water exchange dissolved carbon dioxide dic in meteoric and surface waters most likely originates from atmospheric co2 according to monitoring data for 2000 2020 and 2000 2010 reported from two nearest stations at ulaan uul mongolia and sari taukum kazakhstan respectively https www esrl noaa gov gmd dv iadv δ13c of atmospheric со2 varied from 7 5 to 9 3 with an average over 2019 2020 of 8 6 or from 8 0 to 7 8 7 9 on average in the warm season capture of atmospheric co2 by meteoric waters and related fractionation upon the transition of gaseous to dissolved carbon dioxide co2g co2aq lead to 1 2 13c depletion of co2 zhang et al 1995 das et al 2005 therefore mean annual δ13cdic in meteoric waters is expected to be within 9 8 to 9 1 since dissolved co2 makes the greatest portion of dic while the background dic concentration is 10 2 mmol l das et al 2005 in our case however dic a total of co2aq co3 2 and hco3 components is at least two orders of magnitude above this value table 3 therefore most of dic at the tulinka aquifers comes from soil co2 absorbed by infiltrating waters rather than from atmospheric co2 the range of δ13cdic in the analyzed samples from 14 3 to 9 0 corresponds to a combined co2 origin diffusion of soil co2 approaching the atmospheric δ13cco2 values and biogenic co2 released by decaying plant residues which then participates in mixed silicate carbonate weathering das et al 2005 the δ13cdic values of the tulinka waters varied with time in the course of monitoring from may 2019 through march 2020 fig 6b with a peak of the heaviest δ13cdic 9 9 in august september 2019 after the peak the curve descends gradually and returns to the δ13cdic values of mid 2019 b y march 2020 this pattern may result from the transport of biogenic co2 through soil to the tulinka aquifers with spring flood and meteoric waters indeed the δ13cdic peak which corresponds to the smallest contribution of biogenic co2 into δ13c of soil carbon dioxide falls at the beginning of the driest season when the spring floods and the related voluminous water infiltration through soil already ceases while the meteoric activity does not start yet without regard to additional insolation and evaporation effects thus this is a period of the lowest infiltration when only small amounts of meteoric waters can transport soil co2 like a chromatographic eluent to aquifers ultimate consumers heavy rainfalls since late august till early november provide new inputs of soil co2 enriched in the isotopically light biogenic component into groundwaters the process is inertial and occurs concurrently with soil freezing which hinders the migration of biogenic co2 this may be the cause of the plateau on the curve between november and february 2020 fig 6b the transport of biogenic soil co2 to groundwaters and 12c enrichment of dissolved carbon dioxide resume in the season of snow melting and spring floods the dic concentration in the tulinka waters varied only slightly over the year long observation period from 5300 to 6200 μmol l i e the changes in co2 inputs were minor the observed δ13cdic variations require dramatically different δ13c of the carbon dioxide transported by this mechanism as in the case of biogenic co2 inorganic carbon dissolved in the waters of the tulinka aquifers and the svyatoi spring has radiocarbon ages of 2663 144 and 4518 93 years respectively and is thus of ancient origin however the obtained 14c dates are only approximate as they do not take into account such factors as sources of dic in the waters distribution of carbon species in ambient gases and rocks leaching from rocks etc stefánsson et al 2019 which should be a subject of a separate study nevertheless our results provide further evidence for water circulation through different aquifers surface waters carrying modern dissolved carbon coexist with at least two sites of ancient carbon the younger age of dic in the tulinka waters relative to that in the svyatoi spring may be due to inputs of modern soil co2 and to flooding however the contribution of modern co2 must be rather small as suggested by minor dic variations over the year see above anyway the age of the tulinka waters is only tentative 5 conclusions the radon laden waters of the tulinka aquifers table 1 have so4 hco3 na mg ca major ion chemistry with tds 720 910 mg l and si content 6 41 9 02 mg l the variables ph eh and the concentration of dissolved o2 are mainly controlled by local geology and water exchange patterns the tulinka waters have neutral to slightly alkaline рн 7 3 7 7 and eh values corresponding to the oxidized environment 169 1 to 250 0 mv and contain 2 86 7 37 mg l of dissolved oxygen the results obtained in the studies allow us to conclude that 1 radon rich groundwaters in the tulinka area occur in two aquifers they are i pore waters in quaternary sediments a3qiv alluvium and the krasnaya dubrovka l lai iikd and kochkovo a le2kč formations ii interstitial waters in sheared granites of the novosibirsk complex the main phase the tulinka radon rich waters in both aquifers are affected by anthropogenic pollution as a result of flooding 2 according to the composition signatures of the

values for u and ra isotopes are 706 mbq l for 234u 196 mbq l for 238u 18 mbq l for 226ra and 20 mbq l for 228ra the 234u 238u ratio γ does not exceed 3 6 4 the measured isotope characteristics provide evidence in favor of the meteoric origin of the tulinka waters recharging by infiltration the ranges of stable isotopes are within 15 4 to 15 1 δ18o 114 2 to 112 8 δd and 13 9 to 9 9 δ13cdic the recharge patterns of the waters are independent of seasonal climate variations which is a sign of the zone of slow water exchange 5 the δ13cdic values vary with time presumably in yearly cycles and reach a peak in august september the range of δ13cdic in the analyzed samples from 14 3 to 9 0 corresponds to a combined co2 origin diffusion of soil co2 approaching the atmospheric δ13cco2 values and biogenic co2 released by decaying plant residues 6 for the first time dissolved inorganic carbon was dated by means of the radiocarbon method as 2663 144 years in the tulinka waters and 4518 93 years in the svyatoi spring however the 14c ages are most likely underestimated because the groundwaters are mixed with infiltrated modern surface waters declaration of competing interest the authors

222rn activity in the tulinka waters varies from 173 to 276 bq l which corresponds to very low or low radon waters in the classification of tolstikhin posokhov and tolstikhin 1977 the total α and β activity levels do not exceed 891 mbq l and 80 mbq l respectively natural radionuclides are 0 015 0 017 mg l238u and 4 93 10 10 mg l226ra table 2 the concentrations of thorium analyzed for the first time in the groundwater of tulinka aquifers vary from 9 59 10 7 to 1 58 10 5 mg l232th since the times of v vernadsky 1920s 1930s the concentrations of th and its progenies in water have been considered to be below detection limits vernadsky considered thorium to be beyond water chemistry and beyond the earth s water budget in our case the 232th 238u ratio is within the range expectable for oxidized environments 5 81 10 5 to 9 42 10 4 the activities of u and ra isotopes in the tulinka waters are 706 mbq l for 234u 196 mbq l for 238u 18 mbq l for 226ra and 20 mbq l for 228ra and the isotope ratio 234u 238u γ is within 3 6 this confirms the previous hypothesis of their mixing with the waters of the flooded zone for comparison 222rn in the waters of background composition svyatoi spring in verkh tula village ranges from 7 to 28 bq l the total activity α is 327 mbq l and β activity is 20 mbq l other radionuclides are 0 005 0 007 mg l238u 3 01 10 7 to 8 00 10 6 mg l232th and 2 46 10 10 mg l226ra the 232th 238u ratio ranges from 6 38 10 5 to 4 29 10 3 note that the 238u and 232th concentrations in the waters from the boreholes in verkh tula village are lower than in the spring 3 80 10 6 and 8 00 10 6 mg l respectively while the 232th 238u ratio reaches 1 84 to 2 96 the activity values of u and ra isotopes in the svyatoi spring are 147 mbq l234u 115 mbq l238u 9 mbq l226ra and 7 mbq l228ra the 234u 238u ratio γ does not exceed 1 3 which means a minor contribution from deep waters because the 234u 238u ratio is known to serve as an indirect indicator of the contribution from deep waters into an aquifer osmond and rydell 1968 the analyzed waters mainly occur in oxidized conditions and uranium has the highest mobility its distribution correlates with water

should be stressed that the waters of the upper tula river contain 1 71 10 2 mg l u approaching the concentration of uranium in radon rich water table 2 fig 5 which requires further investigation 4 3 stable isotopes and dic determination of stable isotopes δ18o δd and δ13c and dissolved inorganic carbon dic in groundwater has become indispensable in studies focused on the genesis of natural waters

2019 santucci et al 2019 stefánsson et al 2019 yu et al 2019 aydin et al 2020 newman et al 2020 surface waters as well as a large part of groundwaters have meteoric sources boral et al 2019 cotovicz et al 2019 santucci et al 2019 wu et al 2019 aydin et al 2020 xia et al 2020 novikov et al 2021b the dic and δ13cdic patterns provide some evidence of the interaction of waters with host rocks zhang et al 1995 cartwright et al 2000 górka et al 2011 mickler et al 2019 novikov et al 2021b and hence of the availability properties and origin of carbon atmospheric organic or biogenic co2 etc the tulinka waters show broad ranges of δ18o and δd 18 9 to 9 5 and 139 4 to 86 1 respectively table 3 fig 6 most of the data plot along the global craig 1961 and local novikov et al 2022 meteoric water lines gmwl and lmwl respectively and are thus of meteoric origin however some samples stand apart from the gmwl and lmwl trends red ellipse in fig 6а due to evaporation leading to heavier isotope values chafouq et al 2018 wu et al 2019 yu et al 2019 newman et al 2020 the δ18o shifts with respect to gmwl are listed in table 3 the local evaporation line approaches the one reported previously novikov et al 2022 for the northern novosibirsk region with the respective equations y 5 2x 38 1 and y 5 2x 37 7 where y is δd and x is δ18o the groundwater sampled from the svyatoi spring borehole 1 in verkh tula village and the tula river site 10 in fig 1 have the most depleted hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions from 139 4 to 134 9 δd and 18 9 to 8 2 δ18o other tula river samples 7 8 9 and 11 in fig 1 and those from the other borehole of verkh tula village show heavier isotope compositions of 131 1 to 122 6 δd and 16 9 to 16 2 δ18o the average δ18o and δd values in the tulinka waters are still less negative 15 3 and 113 7 respectively and vary from 15 5 to 14 8 δ18o and 114 2 to 112 8 δd exhibiting seasonal variations the samples from the shallow and slow upper tula river have the heaviest oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions among the analyzed river waters up to 13 2 δ18o and 105 0 δd due to greater evaporation novikov et al 2020b which led to a positive δ18o shift of 1 2 the waters of the gorsky and tulinka flooded quarries differ from all other water samples by the least negative δ18o and δd values 12 4 and 9 5 δ18o 103 2 and 86 1 δd respectively and the greatest δ18o shifts of 1 8 2 6 which is the evidence of evaporation effect most strongly pronounced in the quarries thus the oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions of the tulinka radon waters are heavier than in most of surface and ground svyatoi spring waters in the summer season δ18o and δd in groundwaters are commonly lighter than in surface waters recharging mostly from rainfall and being subject to evapotranspiration this pattern appears in the samples from the svyatoi spring which can be considered as background groundwaters in terms of oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions meanwhile the δ18o and δd values of the tulinka samples heavier than those of surface waters provide implicit evidence that the aquifers feed from sources related neither to the rivers nor to the svyatoi spring note that δ18o and δd in the tulinka waters as well as in the svyatoi spring are poorly sensitive to seasonal effects and thus represent a zone of slow water exchange dissolved carbon dioxide dic in meteoric and surface waters most likely originates from atmospheric co2 according to monitoring data for 2000 2020 and 2000 2010 reported from two nearest stations at ulaan uul mongolia and sari taukum kazakhstan respectively https www esrl noaa gov gmd dv iadv δ13c of atmospheric со2 varied from 7 5 to 9 3 with an average over 2019 2020 of 8 6 or from 8 0 to 7 8 7 9 on average in the warm season capture of atmospheric co2 by meteoric waters and related fractionation upon the transition of gaseous to dissolved carbon dioxide co2g co2aq lead to 1 2 13c depletion of co2 zhang et al 1995 das et al 2005 therefore mean annual δ13cdic in meteoric waters is expected to be within 9 8 to 9 1 since dissolved co2 makes the greatest portion of dic while the background dic concentration is 10 2 mmol l das et al 2005 in our case however dic a total of co2aq co3 2 and hco3 components is at least two orders of magnitude above this value table 3 therefore most of dic at the tulinka aquifers comes from soil co2 absorbed by infiltrating waters rather than from atmospheric co2 the range of δ13cdic in the analyzed samples from 14 3 to 9 0 corresponds to a combined co2 origin diffusion of soil co2 approaching the atmospheric δ13cco2 values and biogenic co2 released by decaying plant residues which then participates in mixed silicate carbonate weathering das et al 2005 the δ13cdic values of the tulinka waters varied with time in the course of monitoring from may 2019 through march 2020 fig 6b with a peak of the heaviest δ13cdic 9 9 in august september 2019 after the peak the curve descends gradually and returns to the δ13cdic values of mid 2019 b y march 2020 this pattern may result from the transport of biogenic co2 through soil to the tulinka aquifers with spring flood and meteoric waters indeed the δ13cdic peak which corresponds to the smallest contribution of biogenic co2 into δ13c of soil carbon dioxide falls at the beginning of the driest season when the spring floods and the related voluminous water infiltration through soil already ceases while the meteoric activity does not start yet without regard to additional insolation and evaporation effects thus this is a period of the lowest infiltration when only small amounts of meteoric waters can transport soil co2 like a chromatographic eluent to aquifers ultimate consumers heavy rainfalls since late august till early november provide new inputs of soil co2 enriched in the isotopically light biogenic component into groundwaters the process is inertial and occurs concurrently with soil freezing which hinders the migration of biogenic co2 this may be the cause of the plateau on the curve between november and february 2020 fig 6b the transport of biogenic soil co2 to groundwaters and 12c enrichment of dissolved carbon dioxide resume in the season of snow melting and spring floods the dic concentration in the tulinka waters varied only slightly over the year long observation period from 5300 to 6200 μmol l i e the changes in co2 inputs were minor the observed δ13cdic variations require dramatically different δ13c of the carbon dioxide transported by this mechanism as in the case of biogenic co2 inorganic carbon dissolved in the waters of the tulinka aquifers and the svyatoi spring has radiocarbon ages of 2663 144 and 4518 93 years respectively and is thus of ancient origin however the obtained 14c dates are only approximate as they do not take into account such factors as sources of dic in the waters distribution of carbon species in ambient gases and rocks leaching from rocks etc stefánsson et al 2019 which should be a subject of a separate study nevertheless our results provide further evidence for water circulation through different aquifers surface waters carrying modern dissolved carbon coexist with at least two sites of ancient carbon the younger age of dic in the tulinka waters relative to that in the svyatoi spring may be due to inputs of modern soil co2 and to flooding however the contribution of modern co2 must be rather small as suggested by minor dic variations over the year see above anyway the age of the tulinka waters is only tentative 5 conclusions the radon laden waters of the tulinka aquifers table 1 have so4 hco3 na mg ca major ion chemistry with tds 720 910 mg l and si content 6 41 9 02 mg l the variables ph eh and the concentration of dissolved o2 are mainly controlled by local geology and water exchange patterns the tulinka waters have neutral to slightly alkaline рн 7 3 7 7 and eh values corresponding to the oxidized environment 169 1 to 250 0 mv and contain 2 86 7 37 mg l of dissolved oxygen the results obtained in the studies allow us to conclude that 1 radon rich groundwaters in the tulinka area occur in two aquifers they are i pore waters in quaternary sediments a3qiv alluvium and the krasnaya dubrovka l lai iikd and kochkovo a le2kč formations ii interstitial waters in sheared granites of the novosibirsk complex the main phase the tulinka radon rich waters in both aquifers are affected by anthropogenic pollution as a result of flooding 2 according to the composition signatures of the tulinka waters in particular significant concentration of nitrates 30 0 59 3 mg l and element ratios ca na 3 5 ca mg 3 3 ca si 16 1 mg si 5 0 na si 4 7 si na 0 2 rna rcl 1 4 and so4 cl 2 0 these are interstitial waters in sheared granites 3 the radon activity in the tulinka waters varies from 160 to 276 bq l222rn and the concentrations of u th and ra isotopes are 0 015 0 017 mg l238u 9 59 10 7 to 1 58 10 5 mg l232th and up to 4 93 10 10 mg l226ra the 232th 238u ratio ranges from 5 81 10 5 to 9 42 10 4 the total ά activity is not higher than 891 mbq l and β activity is 80 mbq l the activity values for u and ra isotopes are 706 mbq l for 234u 196 mbq l for 238u 18 mbq l for 226ra and 20 mbq l for 228ra the 234u 238u ratio γ does not exceed 3 6 4 the measured isotope characteristics provide evidence in favor of the meteoric origin of the tulinka waters recharging by infiltration the ranges of stable isotopes are within 15 4 to 15 1 δ18o 114 2 to 112 8 δd and 13 9 to 9 9 δ13cdic the recharge patterns of the waters are independent of seasonal climate variations which is a sign of the zone of slow water exchange 5 the δ13cdic values vary with time presumably in yearly cycles and reach a peak in august september the range of δ13cdic in the analyzed samples from 14 3 to 9 0 corresponds to a combined co2 origin diffusion of soil co2 approaching the atmospheric δ13cco2 values and biogenic co2 released by decaying plant residues 6 for the first time dissolved inorganic carbon was dated by means of the radiocarbon method as 2663 144 years in the tulinka waters and 4518 93 years in the svyatoi spring however the 14c ages are most likely underestimated because the groundwaters are mixed with infiltrated modern surface waters declaration of competing interest the authors

11729,the recent study aims to detect the spatial distribution of the hydraulic parameters and evaluate the protective capacity of the groundwater aquifers in northern khartoum state using geophysical and hydrogeological methods the study area is located in the transition zone between the sedimentary basin and the area dominated by crystalline basement rocks vertical electrical sounding ves measurements using schlumberger configuration were taken along three profiles to delineate the thicknesses of the sediments and groundwater aquifers the ves measurements were combined with the lithology logs to reduce the uncertainty of the resulting models ves findings denoted that the study area comprises two hydraulically connected aquifers the upper aquifer is composed of fine sandstone with an average thickness of 50 m and the lower aquifer has a thickness of up to 150 m these two aquifers are confined to semi confined separated by relatively thick aquitards to evaluate the aquifer quantitively pumping test analysis using cooper jacob method was applied to estimate the aquifer s hydraulic parameters including transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity the pumping test approach is costly and time consuming and extrapolation of the results is restricted to homogeneous boundary conditions since groundwater aquifers are mostly heterogeneous a geophysical based method called dar zarrouk parameters was applied to give a continuous estimate for the hydraulic parameters dar zarrouk parameters include longitudinal conductance and transverse resistance combining the true resistivity and thickness obtained from the inverted ves data to determine the hydraulic parameters the calculated hydraulic parameters from the pumping test and dar zarrouk parameters showed high compatibility furthermore longitudinal conductance was used to predict the protective capacity of the aquifers generally it ranged from good to very good protective capacity suggesting potable water quality the findings of this research indicated that the groundwater aquifer in the study area is ideal for groundwater exploitation however this study recommends applying a detailed geophysical survey to reduce the uncertainty of the resulting geological and hydrogeological models graphical abstract image 1 keywords khartoum groundwater pumping test dar zarrouk transmissivity hydraulic conductivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction khartoum is the most densely inhabited state in sudan hussein and awad 2006 with more than 10 million population facing an acute shortage of fresh water supply to meet the criteria for following out development plans sudan s groundwater demand has sharply increased abdo and salih 2012 however these modifications in groundwater demand have brought about a number of problems including ineffective pumping decreased reliable production and a decline in groundwater quality mohammed et al 2022 the primary source of water supply in khartoum state is groundwater elkrail and adlan 2019 which is highly affected by over exploitation to fulfill supply sustainability comprehensive studies including hydrogeological and geophysical techniques must be carried out to assess groundwater adequacy and aquifer productivity the geometry of the groundwater aquifer and its hydrogeological properties are the main factors affecting groundwater quantity kwami et al 2019 mohammed 2016 the petrophysical parameters such as porosity and permeability play a significant role in groundwater availability oyeyemi et al 2021 uyanik 2011 porosity is the volume of voids in each rock sample to the total volume while permeability is the ability of the rock to permit fluids to move through it estimating hydrogeological parameters such as hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity is essential in assessing groundwater aquifers szabó 2015 yadav 1995 they reflect the ease through which water moves in the geological formation the conventional method to determine the hydrogeological parameters is by taking a core sample and performing a lab test for parameter identification another approach is to perform a pumping experiment to estimate the hydraulic parameters using a particular pumping test method based on the boundary condition of the aquifer the main disadvantage of using pumping tests to measure the hydrogeological parameters is that performing these tests is expensive and time consuming the obtained parameters represent only the well in which the test is conducted the estimated parameters cannot be extrapolated to dominate vast areas because of the inhomogeneity of the geological formation hydraulic parameters changed dramatically by orders of magnitude in the same aquifer on the other hand in areas where no sufficient hydrogeological data is available surface geophysical methods such as the direct current electrical resistivity method can effectively be applied to characterize the aquifers by acquiring information about the geometry and hydraulic parameters in this research the geoelectrical vertical electrical sounding technique ves is applied to reveal the vertical and horizontal extension of the geological formations it is also employed to give information about hydrogeological parameters vertical electrical sounding is extensively used for hydrogeological studies bayowa et al 2022 ige et al 2022 mohammed 2020 muhammad et al 2022 nugraha et al 2022 nwachukwu et al 2022 olaseeni et al 2018 oyeyemi et al 2021 shah et al 2022 stanly et al 2021 tepoule et al 2022 the product of geophysical inversion of the measured apparent resistivity gives information about layer thickness and true resistivity dar zarrouk parameters were first introduced maillet 1947 using the true resistivities and thicknesses to measure the layers longitudinal conductance and transverse resistance several researchers have successfully linked dar zarrouk to the hydrogeological parameters niwas and singhal 1981 studies about using dar zarrouk parameters in aquifer characterization are widely reported in the literature ebong et al 2014 ezeh 2012 kwami et al 2019 mahmud et al 2022 niwas and singhal 1981 seli et al 2021 utom et al 2012 yusuf et al 2021 dar zarrouk parameters have additionally been applied to detect the vulnerability of the aquifers to surface and subsurface contamination okonkwo austin ugwu 2015 the determination of the protective capacity of the groundwater aquifer helps in the identification of vulnerable zones and the development of remediation schemes oladapo and akintorinwa 2007 groundwater assessment is one of the most crucial tasks in sudan where budgetary constraints necessitate optimal planning for successful exploration the recent research attempts to evaluate the groundwater resources in northern khartoum state the primary goal of this study is to integrate lithological geophysical and hydrogeological methods to determine the thicknesses of the sedimentary sequences and groundwater aquifers detect the spatial distribution of the hydrogeological parameters and predict the protective capacity of the groundwater aquifers this study will positively impact the exploitation and protection of groundwater resources in the northern khartoum area 2 site description and geological setting the studied area is located in bahri locality in northern khartoum state sudan it covers about 300 km2 and is bounded by the nile river from the west fig 1 it is situated in the savanna belt with an average annual precipitation range of 150 mm year the research area has a flat peneplain topography these plains rise gradually from 340 m in the western parts to 600 m above sea level in the east geologically the succession comprises three main units precambrian basement rocks cretaceous nubian formation and the recent deposits the basement rocks consist of gneisses schists and granites and the depth varies between zero when it crops at the surface mainly to the north and eastern sides of the area and reaches up to 500 m in the southern part hussein and awad 2006 the cretaceous nubian formation overlies the precambrian basement rocks awad 1994 kheiralla 1966 saeed 1974 whiteman 1971 this formation consists of conglomerates sandstone and mudstone schrank and awad 1990 the nubian formation with considerable thicknesses is the primary groundwater aquifer in the khartoum basin this formation is intruded on by basaltic volcanic rocks the recent deposits in the study area include windblown and alluvium wadi deposits the lithology of these recent deposits comprises sand gravel and silt of depths ranging from 3 up to 15 m haggaz and kheirallah 1988 the sedimentary rocks represented in the cretaceous nubian formation are conserved through structural faults which form small grabens saturated with groundwater therefore the north khartoum state is a transitioning zone between the cretaceous sedimentary basin and the precambrian basement rocks zeinelabdein and elsheikh 2014 fig 2 shows the geological map of the study area in which the main rock units and geological structure are presented in the khartoum basin groundwater occurs in the weakly cemented sandstone beds of the nubian formation under confined to semiconfined conditions this condition is due to the presence of thin to relatively thick aquitards and aquicludes composed of silts and clays abdelsalam et al 2016 3 materials and methods this study employed lithological logs pumping test analysis and electrical resistivity surveys to characterize groundwater aquifers in northern khartoum state the lithological logs of 3 boreholes are acquired to identify the lithological composition of the layers above and below the aquifer geoelectrical geophysical measurement is conducted using vertical electrical sounding ves technique 10 ves measurements are conducted using schlumberger configuration with electrode spacing ab 2 of 750 m the acquired apparent resistivity is processed using ipi2win software to obtain the thicknesses and true resistivities of the geological succession this software applies model based geophysical inversion through which the observed curve of the measured apparent resistivities is compared to the synthetic model the acceptability of the resulting model is based on the fitness criteria between the observed and calculated data bobachev 2002 ipi2win software uses root mean square rms to express the curves fitness or misfit the main disadvantage of the model based inversion is the resulting solution s nonuniqueness which leads to an ambiguous interpretation of the model to overcome this drawback a priori information about the studied phenomena needs to be collected to ensure a reliable interpretation of the geophysical model ebong et al 2014 this study uses lithological logs to validate the resulting geoelectrical models ves technique measures the vertical variation of the lithology in 1 dimension 1d based on the true resistivities and layer thicknesses three profiles based on three resistivity cross sections were constructed to turn the 1d model into 2d to map the groundwater aquifers the electrical resistivity concept is based on measuring the potential difference through potential electrodes as the electrical current passes through the earth layers the petrophysical parameters that affect the current flow such as porosity water saturation and permeability affect the groundwater flow niwas and singhal 1981 dar zarrouk parameters including longitudinal conductance s in mho and transverse resistance r in ωm2 are used to estimate hydraulic parameters these parameters are based on the analogy between groundwater and electrical current flow yusuf et al 2021 dar zarrouk parameters are an aggregation of layer thicknesses and true resistivity that can ease the interpretation of the electrical models batte et al 2010 fig 3 describes dar zarrouk parameters as an analogy between groundwater and electrical current flow these parameters can be calculated using equations 1 and 2 as 1 s h ρ i 1 n h i ρ i 2 r h ρ i 1 n h i ρ i where h ρ and n are layer thickness true resistivity of the layer and the number of layers respectively based on the analogy between darcy law of groundwater flow and ohm law of electricity flow niwas and singhal 1981 suggested a theoretical relationship between the aquifer transmissivity t and dar zarrouk parameters equations 3 and 4 as 3 t k σ r 4 t k s σ where k is the hydraulic conductivity and σ is the electrical conductivity reciprocal of electrical resistivity heigold et al 1979 proposed an empirical formula to estimate the hydraulic conductivity k based on the relationship between hydraulic conductivity and the resistivity of the aquifer composed of granular materials equation 5 as 5 k 386 4 r a q 0 93283 where raq is the resistivity of the aquiferous layer obtained from vertical electrical sounding based on the values of the total longitudinal conductance the protective capacity of the groundwater aquifer is detected based on the classification suggested by oladapo and akintorinwa 2007 the protective capacity of the aquifer determines the ability of the geological column to hold back the surface and subsurface pollutants the highest longitudinal conductance means high layer thickness and therefore the highest protection for the aquifer aquifers with low longitudinal conductance are vulnerable to surface and subsurface contamination pumping test data for one groundwater well is obtained and analyzed to provide information about the groundwater yield drawdown and hydraulic parameters such as transmissivity and conductivity the result of the pumping test analysis is used to validate those obtained from dar zarrouk parameters the duration of the pumping test was 100 min and the pumping continued until the steady state condition was reached based on the boundary condition of the aquifer and the type of flow to the well cooper jr and jacob 1946 method is applied to estimate the transmissivity and storage coefficient this method operates by fitting a straight line in a plot of time since the pumping started against its corresponding drawdown in a semi logarithmic paper the slope of the line in one logarithmic cycle is measured to give the average drawdown and transmissivity equation 6 as 6 δ s 2 3 q 4 π t where δ s is the drawdown in one logarithmic cycle q is the discharge rate and t is the transmissivity transmissivity is defined as the ease through which water moves at an entire thickness of the aquifer while hydraulic conductivity is the rate of water moving through the unit width of the aquifer thus hydraulic conductivity can be obtained by equation 7 as 7 t k b where k is the hydraulic conductivity and b is the thickness of the aquifer 4 results and discussion 4 1 correlation of lithological logs to ves curves the study was conducted to delineate the groundwater potential zones and evaluate the productivity of the aquifers a number of 10 vertical electrical soundings using schlumberger array is measured in this study along 3 profiles the measured parameter is the apparent resistivity of the subsurface materials this apparent resistivity is matched with master curves to obtain thicknesses and true resistivities of the subsurface layers the apparent resistivity is plotted on the vertical axis against the distance between the current electrode on the horizontal axis firstly the curves were qualitatively interpreted to gain a general concept about the distribution of electrical resistivity with depth soomro et al 2019 the shape of the ves curves gives insight into the thickness and number of layers that make up the model this study compares the obtained thicknesses and true resistivities to the nearest borehole lithology to ensure a reliable interpretation of the sounding data borehole 1 is correlated to ves 7 fig 4 the first layer of ves 7 with a thickness of 1 7 m and resistivity of 197 ωm is correlated to superficial deposits in borehole 1 the second layer of thickness of 9 5 m and 20 3 ωm resistivity corresponded to clay the third layer with a thickness of 24 3 m and a true resistivity of 94 1 ωm is described as fine sandstone it appears in the lithological logs as intercalation between mudstone and sandstone the fourth layer with a thickness of 178 m and resistivity of 127 ωm is interpreted as a saturated sandstone layer a layer of 22 8 ωm resistivity follows this layer and is described as a clay layer borehole 2 is correlated to ves 10 fig 5 the first layer of ves 10 with a thickness of 4 m and resistivity of 27 9 ωm is correlated to clay from the lithology log of borehole 2 the superficial deposit layer does not appear in the ves curve the second layer of thickness of 21 4 m and 180 ωm resistivity corresponds to gravel sand the third layer is described as a weathered basement according to the described lithology from borehole 2 this is also validated by the location of the ves in the geological map in which ves 10 is located near the boundary between sedimentary sequences and crystalline rock the thickness of the weathered profile is 250 m and the resistivity of 127 ωm borehole 3 is correlated to ves 8 fig 6 three layers were identified based on this correlation the first layer of ves 8 with a thickness of 2 m and resistivity of 197 ωm is correlated to superficial deposits in the borehole 3 the second layer of thickness of 8 m and 46 4 ωm resistivity corresponds to the clay the third layer is described as saturated sandstone with a thickness of 140 m and resistivity of 132 ωm this aquiferous layer is followed by a clayey sand layer of 85 3 ωm a clayey layer of 8 m thickness at a depth of 27 m appeared on the lithological logs and was not detected by the electrical sounding this limitation in the ves survey is due to the principle of suppression in which a low thickness will not be reflected in the ves curves when it is situated between two thick layers this is solved by integrating lithological logs and sounding data in the hydrogeological interpretation in this research three profiles extending n s are settled the modeled soundings are joined together to form a true resistivity cross section and change the model from 1d to 2d based on the correlation between ves curves and lithological logs the resistivity cross sections are converted to hydrogeological cross sections to reveal the thicknesses of the aquifers and aquitards and map the geological structures that may influence the presence and movement of groundwater profile 1 as shown in fig 7 is composed of 4 ves points ves 3 ves 7 ves 9 and ves 10 interpreted with the aid of 2 lithological logs represented in boreholes 1 and 2 this profile consists of 6 geological units superficial deposits with a resistivity of 197 ωm and thickness of 1 7 m represent the surficial layer this layer is followed by a clay layer with average thickness and resistivity of 10 m and 18 ωm respectively the third layer is a saturated fine sandstone layer with an average thickness of 20 m this layer appeared in the southern part of the profile in ves 3 7 and 9 and its lithology changed to gravely sand in ves 10 this is mainly because of the effect of a normal fault which led to the separation of the sedimentary sequences from basement rocks the fourth layer is a sandy clay layer with an average thickness of 15 m that has appeared only on ves 3 and lithological logs this semi pervious layer is considered an aquitard which separates the upper saturated layer from the lower one the fifth layer is a thick saturated layer composed of coarse sandstone with an average thickness of 120 m this profile indicates the transition zone in which the study area is located this result was also suggested by zeinelabdein and elsheikh 2014 profile 2 is formed from 3 ves points ves 2 ves 5 and ves 8 extending n s integrated with the lithology log of borehole 3 fig 8 in general this profile is composed of 4 layers the first layer of superficial deposits with an average thickness of 2 m followed by a clay layer with an average thickness of 10 m the third layer is interpreted as saturated fine sandstone with an average thickness of 10 m underlaid by aquitard composed of clay with an average thickness of 8 m this aquitard appeared only on the lithological log this is because of the equivalence principle in which the ves curve does not reflect a low resistivity layer when it has located between two high resistivity layers the principle of equivalence is one of the main disadvantages of ves measurements profile 3 consists of ves 1 and ves 4 this profile comprises four geological units fig 9 superficial deposits of an average thickness of 3 m represent the first layer the second layer is interpreted as clay with a thickness of 20 m the third layer is saturated fine sandstone and the fourth layer represents the saturated coarse sandstone layer it can be concluded from the integration of the sounding and the lithological logs that two water bearing formations are hosting the groundwater in the study area the upper aquifer comprises fine sandstone with thicknesses ranging from 10 to 100 m and the lower aquifer is of relatively coarse sandstone with thicknesses up to 150 m these two aquifers are separated by a reasonably thick aquitard composed of clay and sandy clay the obtained results are compatible with the studies of abdelsalam et al 2016 ali 2011 farah et al 1997 omer and elzein 2018 4 2 pumping test analysis pumping test analysis is performed based on the assumption suggested by cooper jr and jacob 1946 for a shallow groundwater borehole borehole 1 with a total depth of 70 m according to lithological logs the groundwater aquifer is found at a depth of 48 m with a thickness of 22 m the nearest ves suggested that the layer extent up to 100 m in this study the data from ves measurements are used instead of the lithological logs to measure the hydrogeological properties of the aquifer the interpretation of resistivity profiles revealed that the aquifer is confined to semi confined the groundwater flow to the well is steady based on the pumping test data in the steady state condition the recharge to the aquifer is equal to the discharge from the well therefore the drawdown or displacement of the groundwater level is negligible as the pumping continues fetter 2018 the pumping with a total discharge of 709 m3 d lasted for 100 min until the steady state was reached and the corresponding drawdown was calculated the measured drawdown represents the solution of the cooper jacob equation where unknown variables are included mathon et al 2008 the drawdown is plotted against its corresponding time and cooper jacob straight line is fitted fig 10 the measured transmissivity is 529 8 m2 d while the storage coefficient is 0 0004145 the hydraulic conductivity in this case is measured using equation 7 the hydraulic conductivity is 5 29 m2 d according to krásný 1993 the measured hydrogeological parameters suggest that the study area is in ideal condition for groundwater exploitation 4 3 dar zarrouk and hydrogeological parameters dar zarrouk parameters are successfully applied to outline the aquifer properties and groundwater conditions maillet 1947 these parameters including transverse resistance and longitudinal conductance were used to evaluate the productivity of the study area s lower aquifer by estimating the hydrogeological parameters such as transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity where there is an overlapping of comparable lithologies in the geoelectrical data the dar zarrouk parameters reduce the uncertainties in the interpretation hasan et al 2019 table 1 illustrates the results of ves inversion and their corresponding dar zarrouk parameters for each layer the total longitudinal conductance is also calculated to evaluate the hydrogeological column in each ves station and predict the protective capacity of the aquifers transverse resistance for the groundwater aquifer in the study area ranges from 3764 8 ωm2 in the northern part to 23 375 ωm2 in the southern part the areal distribution is given in fig 12 a the lowest value of transverse resistance is not necessarily an indication of low potentiality but instead of the presence of fine materials or low thickness of the aquifer ezeh 2012 in this study the lowest value of transverse resistance is observed in the ves 10 station in which the low thickness of the gravely sand aquifer is detected as given in fig 12 b the highest value of longitudinal conductance 1 27 ω 1 is observed in the central part while the lowest 0 11 ω 1 is detected in the northern part of the study area the hydraulic conductivity reflects the rate of groundwater flow per unit cross sectional area freeze and cherry 1979 its highly affected by other petrophysical parameters such as porosity shale and water content high values of hydraulic conductivity indicate high productivity of the groundwater aquifer in this research hydraulic conductivity is calculated using an empirical equation developed by heigold et al 1979 this equation is based on the resistivity of the aquiferous layer table 2 shows the results of the hydrogeological properties calculated from dar zarrouk parameters the obtained hydraulic conductivity of the main groundwater aquifer in the study area ranges from 2 94 to 5 17 m2 d the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity values fig 12 c shows that the central and southern part of the study area is characterized by high values of hydraulic conductivities which are reflected by the nature of the petrophysical properties of the aquifer materials such as good porosity permeability and low shale content this aquifer is relatively homogeneous according to the obtained hydraulic conductivities the transmissivity value explains the flow rate in the aquifer s full width so transmissivity can be obtained by multiplying the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer by its total saturated thickness the transmissivity of the aquifer in this study is calculated by the theoretical equation suggested by niwas and singhal 1981 based on the association between transmissivity hydraulic conductivity transverse resistance and longitudinal conductance the transmissivity values range from 521 to 932 3 m2 day fig 12 d shows the geographical variation in transmissivity in the study area the highest transmissivities appeared in the central part of the study area in the ves 8 location where a great thickness of coarse sandstone layer is observed while the lowest one is detected in the ves 10 station as in transverse resistance this is because of the lower thickness of the saturated layer as illustrated in fig 11 transmissivity is highly correlated with longitudinal conductance with a correlation factor of 1 which indicate that the assumption of niwas and singhal 1981 is applicable in our study area transmissivity as always showed a high correlation with hydraulic conductivity 0 74 and layer thicknesses 0 92 the hydrogeological parameters obtained from pumping test data analysis in borehole 1 show high compatibility with those of geophysical based hydrogeological parameters in the nearest ves station ves 7 the transmissivity value calculated from pumping test data using cooper jacob equation is 529 8 m2 d while from dar zarrouk parameters is 567 8 m2 d based on these results the aquifer is moderately to highly productive and suitable for groundwater development according to krásný 1993 classification 4 4 protective capacity of the aquifers the ability of the geological layers to hold back the surface and subsurface contamination can be inferred from longitudinal conductance bayewu et al 2018 this safeguarding capacity of the subsurface materials is proportional to longitudinal conductance and inversely proportional to the vertical and horizontal hydraulic conductivity tijani et al 2021 in this study the protective capacity of the aquifers is indicated table 1 based on the classification given by oladapo and akintorinwa 2007 table 3 shows the classification of the protective capacity of the aquifer based on their total longitudinal conductance the total transverse resistance and longitudinal conductance are shown in fig 13 a and b respectively since the aquifers in the study area are under confined to semi confined conditions the protective capacity is ranged from very good to moderate if the groundwater aquifer is shallow and the materials overlie the aquifer are thin and permeable the protective capacity is low and then the aquifer is prone to contamination the advection of the contaminant in which the pollutant is transported by the groundwater flow can be read through longitudinal conductance fig 13 c shows the protective capacity of the aquifers in the study area the highest protective capacity with a very good class is reported in ves 9 and ves 4 locations where a thick clay layer is indicated while the lowest protective capacity with moderate class is reported in ves 10 station where the groundwater aquifer is close to the surface and covered by a thin clay layer the remaining ves stations with good protective capacity dominate the majority of the study area the study area is agricultural land however the state of groundwater quality is not highly affected by agricultural operation abdelsalam et al 2016 groundwater contamination from agricultural practice involves irrigation return flow and the use of fertilizers and pesticides the resistance of the groundwater aquifer to pollution can be explained by the obtained high protective capacities 5 conclusion this study delineated and characterized the groundwater aquifer in north khartoum state following an integrated approach a geoelectrical resistivity survey using vertical electrical sounding ves technique is used to delineate the subsurface sediments and explore groundwater potentialities ves data was interpreted using 1d geophysical inversion technique to obtain true resistivities and thicknesses of the subsurface layers lithological logs were integrated with the sounding data for a reliable interpretation of ves measurements the results showed that the study area is composed of two aquifer systems an upper aquifer comprises fine sandstone and a lower one is composed of coarse sandstone with high thicknesses the latter represents the main water bearing formation in the study area to detect the productivity of the groundwater aquifers the hydraulic parameters such as transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity are estimated following two approaches pumping test and dar zarrouk analysis pumping test analysis is the most widely applied method to characterize groundwater aquifers however these methods are costly and time consuming on the other hand dar zarrouk parameters are a powerful approach to estimating the aquifers hydraulic properties and protective capacity based on the ves data unlike pumping test analysis this approach gives a continuous and comprehensive estimate of the hydraulic parameters however to increase the uniqueness of this geophysics based model the results were validated by the results obtained from pumping test data the two combined models showed high compatibility dar zarrouk parameters were also used to predict the protective capacity of the aquifers the overall protective capacity of the aquifer indicates the good quality of the groundwater this approach can be followed in areas in sudan where insufficient hydrogeological data is available for aquifer characterization however this study recommends applying a detailed geophysical survey to reduce the uncertainty of the resulting geological and hydrogeological models for instance geophysical well logging methods can guide surface geophysical methods in delineating the water saturated zones and detecting the petrophysical parameters such as porosity permeability and hydraulic conductivity we also recommend conducting electrical resistivity tomography ert with 2d geophysical inversion to detect and estimate the aquifer geometry and hydrogeological parameters accurately declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

11729,the recent study aims to detect the spatial distribution of the hydraulic parameters and evaluate the protective capacity of the groundwater aquifers in northern khartoum state using geophysical and hydrogeological methods the study area is located in the transition zone between the sedimentary basin and the area dominated by crystalline basement rocks vertical electrical sounding ves measurements using schlumberger configuration were taken along three profiles to delineate the thicknesses of the sediments and groundwater aquifers the ves measurements were combined with the lithology logs to reduce the uncertainty of the resulting models ves findings denoted that the study area comprises two hydraulically connected aquifers the upper aquifer is composed of fine sandstone with an average thickness of 50 m and the lower aquifer has a thickness of up to 150 m these two aquifers are confined to semi confined separated by relatively thick aquitards to evaluate the aquifer quantitively pumping test analysis using cooper jacob method was applied to estimate the aquifer s hydraulic parameters including transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity the pumping test approach is costly and time consuming and extrapolation of the results is restricted to homogeneous boundary conditions since groundwater aquifers are mostly heterogeneous a geophysical based method called dar zarrouk parameters was applied to give a continuous estimate for the hydraulic parameters dar zarrouk parameters include longitudinal conductance and transverse resistance combining the true resistivity and thickness obtained from the inverted ves data to determine the hydraulic parameters the calculated hydraulic parameters from the pumping test and dar zarrouk parameters showed high compatibility furthermore longitudinal conductance was used to predict the protective capacity of the aquifers generally it ranged from good to very good protective capacity suggesting potable water quality the findings of this research indicated that the groundwater aquifer in the study area is ideal for groundwater exploitation however this study recommends applying a detailed geophysical survey to reduce the uncertainty of the resulting geological and hydrogeological models graphical abstract image 1 keywords khartoum groundwater pumping test dar zarrouk transmissivity hydraulic conductivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction khartoum is the most densely inhabited state in sudan hussein and awad 2006 with more than 10 million population facing an acute shortage of fresh water supply to meet the criteria for following out development plans sudan s groundwater demand has sharply increased abdo and salih 2012 however these modifications in groundwater demand have brought about a number of problems including ineffective pumping decreased reliable production and a decline in groundwater quality mohammed et al 2022 the primary source of water supply in khartoum state is groundwater elkrail and adlan 2019 which is highly affected by over exploitation to fulfill supply sustainability comprehensive studies including hydrogeological and geophysical techniques must be carried out to assess groundwater adequacy and aquifer productivity the geometry of the groundwater aquifer and its hydrogeological properties are the main factors affecting groundwater quantity kwami et al 2019 mohammed 2016 the petrophysical parameters such as porosity and permeability play a significant role in groundwater availability oyeyemi et al 2021 uyanik 2011 porosity is the volume of voids in each rock sample to the total volume while permeability is the ability of the rock to permit fluids to move through it estimating hydrogeological parameters such as hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity is essential in assessing groundwater aquifers szabó 2015 yadav 1995 they reflect the ease through which water moves in the geological formation the conventional method to determine the hydrogeological parameters is by taking a core sample and performing a lab test for parameter identification another approach is to perform a pumping experiment to estimate the hydraulic parameters using a particular pumping test method based on the boundary condition of the aquifer the main disadvantage of using pumping tests to measure the hydrogeological parameters is that performing these tests is expensive and time consuming the obtained parameters represent only the well in which the test is conducted the estimated parameters cannot be extrapolated to dominate vast areas because of the inhomogeneity of the geological formation hydraulic parameters changed dramatically by orders of magnitude in the same aquifer on the other hand in areas where no sufficient hydrogeological data is available surface geophysical methods such as the direct current electrical resistivity method can effectively be applied to characterize the aquifers by acquiring information about the geometry and hydraulic parameters in this research the geoelectrical vertical electrical sounding technique ves is applied to reveal the vertical and horizontal extension of the geological formations it is also employed to give information about hydrogeological parameters vertical electrical sounding is extensively used for hydrogeological studies

the product of geophysical inversion of the measured apparent resistivity gives information about layer thickness and true resistivity dar zarrouk parameters were first introduced maillet 1947 using the true resistivities and thicknesses to measure the layers longitudinal conductance and transverse resistance several researchers have successfully linked dar zarrouk to the hydrogeological parameters niwas and singhal 1981 studies about using dar zarrouk parameters in aquifer characterization are widely reported in the literature ebong et al 2014 ezeh 2012 kwami et al 2019 mahmud et al 2022 niwas and singhal 1981 seli et al 2021 utom et al 2012 yusuf et al 2021 dar zarrouk parameters have additionally been applied to detect the vulnerability of the aquifers to surface and subsurface contamination okonkwo austin ugwu 2015 the determination of the protective capacity of the groundwater aquifer helps in the identification of vulnerable zones and the development of remediation schemes oladapo and akintorinwa 2007 groundwater assessment is one of the most crucial tasks in sudan where budgetary constraints necessitate optimal planning for successful exploration the recent research attempts to evaluate the groundwater resources in northern khartoum state the primary goal of this study is to integrate lithological geophysical and hydrogeological methods to determine the thicknesses of the sedimentary sequences and groundwater aquifers detect the spatial distribution of the hydrogeological parameters and predict the protective capacity of the groundwater aquifers this study will positively impact the exploitation and protection of groundwater resources in the northern khartoum area 2 site description and geological setting the studied area is located in bahri locality in northern khartoum state sudan it covers about 300 km2 and is bounded by the nile river from the west fig 1 it is situated in the savanna belt with an average annual precipitation range of 150 mm year the research area has a flat peneplain topography these plains rise gradually from 340 m in the western parts to 600 m above sea level in the east geologically the succession comprises three main units precambrian basement rocks cretaceous nubian formation and the recent deposits the basement rocks consist of gneisses schists and granites and the depth varies between zero when it crops at the surface mainly to the north and eastern sides of the area and reaches up to 500 m in the southern part hussein and awad 2006 the cretaceous nubian formation overlies the precambrian basement rocks awad 1994 kheiralla 1966 saeed 1974 whiteman 1971 this formation consists of conglomerates sandstone and mudstone schrank and awad 1990 the nubian formation with considerable thicknesses is the primary groundwater aquifer in the khartoum basin this formation is intruded on by basaltic volcanic rocks the recent deposits in the study area include windblown and alluvium wadi deposits the lithology of these recent deposits comprises sand gravel and silt of depths ranging from 3 up to 15 m haggaz and kheirallah 1988 the sedimentary rocks represented in the cretaceous nubian formation are conserved through structural faults which form small grabens saturated with groundwater therefore the north khartoum state is a transitioning zone between the cretaceous sedimentary basin and the precambrian basement rocks zeinelabdein and elsheikh 2014 fig 2 shows the geological map of the study area in which the main rock units and geological structure are presented in the khartoum basin groundwater occurs in the weakly cemented sandstone beds of the nubian formation under confined to semiconfined conditions this condition is due to the presence of thin to relatively thick aquitards and aquicludes composed of silts and clays abdelsalam et al 2016 3 materials and methods this study employed lithological logs pumping test analysis and electrical resistivity surveys to characterize groundwater aquifers in northern khartoum state the lithological logs of 3 boreholes are acquired to identify the lithological composition of the layers above and below the aquifer geoelectrical geophysical measurement is conducted using vertical electrical sounding ves technique 10 ves measurements are conducted using schlumberger configuration with electrode spacing ab 2 of 750 m the acquired apparent resistivity is processed using ipi2win software to obtain the thicknesses and true resistivities of the geological succession this software applies model based geophysical inversion through which the observed curve of the measured apparent resistivities is compared to the synthetic model the acceptability of the resulting model is based on the fitness criteria between the observed and calculated data bobachev 2002 ipi2win software uses root mean square rms to express the curves fitness or misfit the main disadvantage of the model based inversion is the resulting solution s nonuniqueness which leads to an ambiguous interpretation of the model to overcome this drawback a priori information about the studied phenomena needs to be collected to ensure a reliable interpretation of the geophysical model ebong et al 2014 this study uses lithological logs to validate the resulting geoelectrical models ves technique measures the vertical variation of the lithology in 1 dimension 1d based on the true resistivities and layer thicknesses three profiles based on three resistivity cross sections were constructed to turn the 1d model into 2d to map the groundwater aquifers the electrical resistivity concept is based on measuring the potential difference through potential electrodes as the electrical current passes through the earth layers the petrophysical parameters that affect the current flow such as porosity water saturation and permeability affect the groundwater flow niwas and singhal 1981 dar zarrouk parameters including longitudinal conductance s in mho and transverse resistance r in ωm2 are used to estimate hydraulic parameters these parameters are based on the analogy between groundwater and electrical current flow yusuf et al 2021 dar zarrouk parameters are an aggregation of layer thicknesses and true resistivity that can ease the interpretation of the electrical models batte et al 2010 fig 3 describes dar zarrouk parameters as an analogy between groundwater and electrical current flow these parameters can be calculated using equations 1 and 2 as 1 s h ρ i 1 n h i ρ i 2 r h ρ i 1 n h i ρ i where h ρ and n are layer thickness true resistivity of the layer and the number of layers respectively based on the analogy between darcy law of groundwater flow and ohm law of electricity flow niwas and singhal 1981 suggested a theoretical relationship between the aquifer transmissivity t and dar zarrouk parameters equations 3 and 4 as 3 t k σ r 4 t k s σ where k is the hydraulic conductivity and σ is the electrical conductivity reciprocal of electrical resistivity heigold et al 1979 proposed an empirical formula to estimate the hydraulic conductivity k based on the relationship between hydraulic conductivity and the resistivity of the aquifer composed of granular materials equation 5 as 5 k 386 4 r a q 0 93283 where raq is the resistivity of the aquiferous layer obtained from vertical electrical sounding based on the values of the total longitudinal conductance the protective capacity of the groundwater aquifer is detected based on the classification suggested by oladapo and akintorinwa 2007 the protective capacity of the aquifer determines the ability of the geological column to hold back the surface and subsurface pollutants the highest longitudinal conductance means high layer thickness and therefore the highest protection for the aquifer aquifers with low longitudinal conductance are vulnerable to surface and subsurface contamination pumping test data for one groundwater well is obtained and analyzed to provide information about the groundwater yield drawdown and hydraulic parameters such as transmissivity and conductivity the result of the pumping test analysis is used to validate those obtained from dar zarrouk parameters the duration of the pumping test was 100 min and the pumping continued until the steady state condition was reached based on the boundary condition of the aquifer and the type of flow to the well cooper jr and jacob 1946 method is applied to estimate the transmissivity and storage coefficient this method operates by fitting a straight line in a plot of time since the pumping started against its corresponding drawdown in a semi logarithmic paper the slope of the line in one logarithmic cycle is measured to give the average drawdown and transmissivity equation 6 as 6 δ s 2 3 q 4 π t where δ s is the drawdown in one logarithmic cycle q is the discharge rate and t is the transmissivity transmissivity is defined as the ease through which water moves at an entire thickness of the aquifer while hydraulic conductivity is the rate of water moving through the unit width of the aquifer thus hydraulic conductivity can be obtained by equation 7 as 7 t k b where k is the hydraulic conductivity and b is the thickness of the aquifer 4 results and discussion 4 1 correlation of lithological logs to ves curves the study was conducted to delineate the groundwater potential zones and evaluate the productivity of the aquifers a number of 10 vertical electrical soundings using schlumberger array is measured in this study along 3 profiles the measured parameter is the apparent resistivity of the subsurface materials this apparent resistivity is matched with master curves to obtain thicknesses and true resistivities of the subsurface layers the apparent resistivity is plotted on the vertical axis against the distance between the current electrode on the horizontal axis firstly the curves were qualitatively interpreted to gain a general concept about the distribution of electrical resistivity with depth soomro et al 2019 the shape of the ves curves gives insight into the thickness and number of layers that make up the model this study compares the obtained thicknesses and true resistivities to the nearest borehole lithology to ensure a reliable interpretation of the sounding data borehole 1 is correlated to ves 7 fig 4 the first layer of ves 7 with a thickness of 1 7 m and resistivity of 197 ωm is correlated to superficial deposits in borehole 1 the second layer of thickness of 9 5 m and 20 3 ωm resistivity corresponded to clay the third layer with a thickness of 24 3 m and a true resistivity of 94 1 ωm is described as fine sandstone it appears in the lithological logs as intercalation between mudstone and sandstone the fourth layer with a thickness of 178 m and resistivity of 127 ωm is interpreted as a saturated sandstone layer a layer of 22 8 ωm resistivity follows this layer and is described as a clay layer borehole 2 is correlated to ves 10 fig 5 the first layer of ves 10 with a thickness of 4 m and resistivity of 27 9 ωm is correlated to clay from the lithology log of borehole 2 the superficial deposit layer does not appear in the ves curve the second layer of thickness of 21 4 m and 180 ωm resistivity corresponds to gravel sand the third layer is described as a weathered basement according to the described lithology from borehole 2 this is also validated by the location of the ves in the geological map in which ves 10 is located near the boundary between sedimentary sequences and crystalline rock the thickness of the weathered profile is 250 m and the resistivity of 127 ωm borehole 3 is correlated to ves 8 fig 6 three layers were identified based on this correlation the first layer of ves 8 with a thickness of 2 m and resistivity of 197 ωm is correlated to superficial deposits in the borehole 3 the second layer of thickness of 8 m and 46 4 ωm resistivity corresponds to the clay the third layer is described as saturated sandstone with a thickness of 140 m and resistivity of 132 ωm this aquiferous layer is followed by a clayey sand layer of 85 3 ωm a clayey layer of 8 m thickness at a depth of 27 m appeared on the lithological logs and was not detected by the electrical sounding this limitation in the ves survey is due to the principle of suppression in which a low thickness will not be reflected in the ves curves when it is situated between two thick layers this is solved by integrating lithological logs and sounding data in the hydrogeological interpretation in this research three profiles extending n s are settled the modeled soundings are joined together to form a true resistivity cross section and change the model from 1d to 2d based on the correlation between ves curves and lithological logs the resistivity cross sections are converted to hydrogeological cross sections to reveal the thicknesses of the aquifers and aquitards and map the geological structures that may influence the presence and movement of groundwater profile 1 as shown in fig 7 is composed of 4 ves points ves 3 ves 7 ves 9 and ves 10 interpreted with the aid of 2 lithological logs represented in boreholes 1 and 2 this profile consists of 6 geological units superficial deposits with a resistivity of 197 ωm and thickness of 1 7 m represent the surficial layer this layer is followed by a clay layer with average thickness and resistivity of 10 m and 18 ωm respectively the third layer is a saturated fine sandstone layer with an average thickness of 20 m this layer appeared in the southern part of the profile in ves 3 7 and 9 and its lithology changed to gravely sand in ves 10 this is mainly because of the effect of a normal fault which led to the separation of the sedimentary sequences from basement rocks the fourth layer is a sandy clay layer with an average thickness of 15 m that has appeared only on ves 3 and lithological logs this semi pervious layer is considered an aquitard which separates the upper saturated layer from the lower one the fifth layer is a thick saturated layer composed of coarse sandstone with an average thickness of 120 m this profile indicates the transition zone in which the study area is located this result was also suggested by zeinelabdein and elsheikh 2014 profile 2 is formed from 3 ves points ves 2 ves 5 and ves 8 extending n s integrated with the lithology log of borehole 3 fig 8 in general this profile is composed of 4 layers the first layer of superficial deposits with an average thickness of 2 m followed by a clay layer with an average thickness of 10 m the third layer is interpreted as saturated fine sandstone with an average thickness of 10 m underlaid by aquitard composed of clay with an average thickness of 8 m this aquitard appeared only on the lithological log this is because of the equivalence principle in which the ves curve does not reflect a low resistivity layer when it has located between two high resistivity layers the principle of equivalence is one of the main disadvantages of ves measurements profile 3 consists of ves 1 and ves 4 this profile comprises four geological units fig 9 superficial deposits of an average thickness of 3 m represent the first layer the second layer is interpreted as clay with a thickness of 20 m the third layer is saturated fine sandstone and the fourth layer represents the saturated coarse sandstone layer it can be concluded from the integration of the sounding and the lithological logs that two water bearing formations are hosting the groundwater in the study area the upper aquifer comprises fine sandstone with thicknesses ranging from 10 to 100 m and the lower aquifer is of relatively coarse sandstone with thicknesses up to 150 m these two aquifers are separated by a reasonably thick aquitard composed of clay and sandy clay the obtained results are compatible with the studies of abdelsalam et al 2016 ali 2011 farah et al 1997 omer and elzein 2018 4 2 pumping test analysis pumping test analysis is performed based on the assumption suggested by cooper jr and jacob 1946 for a shallow groundwater borehole borehole 1 with a total depth of 70 m according to lithological logs the groundwater aquifer is found at a depth of 48 m with a thickness of 22 m the nearest ves suggested that the layer extent up to 100 m in this study the data from ves measurements are used instead of the lithological logs to measure the hydrogeological properties of the aquifer the interpretation of resistivity profiles revealed that the aquifer is confined to semi confined the groundwater flow to the well is steady based on the pumping test data in the steady state condition the recharge to the aquifer is equal to the discharge from the well therefore the drawdown or displacement of the groundwater level is negligible as the pumping continues fetter 2018 the pumping with a total discharge of 709 m3 d lasted for 100 min until the steady state was reached and the corresponding drawdown was calculated the measured drawdown represents the solution of the cooper jacob equation where unknown variables are included mathon et al 2008 the drawdown is plotted against its corresponding time and cooper jacob straight line is fitted fig 10 the measured transmissivity is 529 8 m2 d while the storage coefficient is 0 0004145 the hydraulic conductivity in this case is measured using equation 7 the hydraulic conductivity is 5 29 m2 d according to krásný 1993 the measured hydrogeological parameters suggest that the study area is in ideal condition for groundwater exploitation 4 3 dar zarrouk and hydrogeological parameters dar zarrouk parameters are successfully applied to outline the aquifer properties and groundwater conditions maillet 1947 these parameters including transverse resistance and longitudinal conductance were used to evaluate the productivity of the study area s lower aquifer by estimating the hydrogeological parameters such as transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity where there is an overlapping of comparable lithologies in the geoelectrical data the dar zarrouk parameters reduce the uncertainties in the interpretation hasan et al 2019 table 1 illustrates the results of ves inversion and their corresponding dar zarrouk parameters for each layer the total longitudinal conductance is also calculated to evaluate the hydrogeological column in each ves station and predict the protective capacity of the aquifers transverse resistance for the groundwater aquifer in the study area ranges from 3764 8 ωm2 in the northern part to 23 375 ωm2 in the southern part the areal distribution is given in fig 12 a the lowest value of transverse resistance is not necessarily an indication of low potentiality but instead of the presence of fine materials or low thickness of the aquifer ezeh 2012 in this study the lowest value of transverse resistance is observed in the ves 10 station in which the low thickness of the gravely sand aquifer is detected as given in fig 12 b the highest value of longitudinal conductance 1 27 ω 1 is observed in the central part while the lowest 0 11 ω 1 is detected in the northern part of the study area the hydraulic conductivity reflects the rate of groundwater flow per unit cross sectional area freeze and cherry 1979 its highly affected by other petrophysical parameters such as porosity shale and water content high values of hydraulic conductivity indicate high productivity of the groundwater aquifer in this research hydraulic conductivity is calculated using an empirical equation developed by heigold et al 1979 this equation is based on the resistivity of the aquiferous layer table 2 shows the results of the hydrogeological properties calculated from dar zarrouk parameters the obtained hydraulic conductivity of the main groundwater aquifer in the study area ranges from 2 94 to 5 17 m2 d the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity values fig 12 c shows that the central and southern part of the study area is characterized by high values of hydraulic conductivities which are reflected by the nature of the petrophysical properties of the aquifer materials such as good porosity permeability and low shale content this aquifer is relatively homogeneous according to the obtained hydraulic conductivities the transmissivity value explains the flow rate in the aquifer s full width so transmissivity can be obtained by multiplying the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer by its total saturated thickness the transmissivity of the aquifer in this study is calculated by the theoretical equation suggested by niwas and singhal 1981 based on the association between transmissivity hydraulic conductivity transverse resistance and longitudinal conductance the transmissivity values range from 521 to 932 3 m2 day fig 12 d shows the geographical variation in transmissivity in the study area the highest transmissivities appeared in the central part of the study area in the ves 8 location where a great thickness of coarse sandstone layer is observed while the lowest one is detected in the ves 10 station as in transverse resistance this is because of the lower thickness of the saturated layer as illustrated in fig 11 transmissivity is highly correlated with longitudinal conductance with a correlation factor of 1 which indicate that the assumption of niwas and singhal 1981 is applicable in our study area transmissivity as always showed a high correlation with hydraulic conductivity 0 74 and layer thicknesses 0 92 the hydrogeological parameters obtained from pumping test data analysis in borehole 1 show high compatibility with those of geophysical based hydrogeological parameters in the nearest ves station ves 7 the transmissivity value calculated from pumping test data using cooper jacob equation is 529 8 m2 d while from dar zarrouk parameters is 567 8 m2 d based on these results the aquifer is moderately to highly productive and suitable for groundwater development according to krásný 1993 classification 4 4 protective capacity of the aquifers the ability of the geological layers to hold back the surface and subsurface contamination can be inferred from longitudinal conductance bayewu et al 2018 this safeguarding capacity of the subsurface materials is proportional to longitudinal conductance and inversely proportional to the vertical and horizontal hydraulic conductivity tijani et al 2021 in this study the protective capacity of the aquifers is indicated table 1 based on the classification given by oladapo and akintorinwa 2007 table 3 shows the classification of the protective capacity of the aquifer based on their total longitudinal conductance the total transverse resistance and longitudinal conductance are shown in fig 13 a and b respectively since the aquifers in the study area are under confined to semi confined conditions the protective capacity is ranged from very good to moderate if the groundwater aquifer is shallow and the materials overlie the aquifer are thin and permeable the protective capacity is low and then the aquifer is prone to contamination the advection of the contaminant in which the pollutant is transported by the groundwater flow can be read through longitudinal conductance fig 13 c shows the protective capacity of the aquifers in the study area the highest protective capacity with a very good class is reported in ves 9 and ves 4 locations where a thick clay layer is indicated while the lowest protective capacity with moderate class is reported in ves 10 station where the groundwater aquifer is close to the surface and covered by a thin clay layer the remaining ves stations with good protective capacity dominate the majority of the study area the study area is agricultural land however the state of groundwater quality is not highly affected by agricultural operation abdelsalam et al 2016 groundwater contamination from agricultural practice involves irrigation return flow and the use of fertilizers and pesticides the resistance of the groundwater aquifer to pollution can be explained by the obtained high protective capacities 5 conclusion this study delineated and characterized the groundwater aquifer in north khartoum state following an integrated approach a geoelectrical resistivity survey using vertical electrical sounding ves technique is used to delineate the subsurface sediments and explore groundwater potentialities ves data was interpreted using 1d geophysical inversion technique to obtain true resistivities and thicknesses of the subsurface layers lithological logs were integrated with the sounding data for a reliable interpretation of ves measurements the results showed that the study area is composed of two aquifer systems an upper aquifer comprises fine sandstone and a lower one is composed of coarse sandstone with high thicknesses the latter represents the main water bearing formation in the study area to detect the productivity of the groundwater aquifers the hydraulic parameters such as transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity are estimated following two approaches pumping test and dar zarrouk analysis pumping test analysis is the most widely applied method to characterize groundwater aquifers however these methods are costly and time consuming on the other hand dar zarrouk parameters are a powerful approach to estimating the aquifers hydraulic properties and protective capacity based on the ves data unlike pumping test analysis this approach gives a continuous and comprehensive estimate of the hydraulic parameters however to increase the uniqueness of this geophysics based model the results were validated by the results obtained from pumping test data the two combined models showed high compatibility dar zarrouk parameters were also used to predict the protective capacity of the aquifers the overall protective capacity of the aquifer indicates the good quality of the groundwater this approach can be followed in areas in sudan where insufficient hydrogeological data is available for aquifer characterization however this study recommends applying a detailed geophysical survey to reduce the uncertainty of the resulting geological and hydrogeological models for instance geophysical well logging methods can guide surface geophysical methods in delineating the water saturated zones and detecting the petrophysical parameters such as porosity permeability and hydraulic conductivity we also recommend conducting electrical resistivity tomography ert with 2d geophysical inversion to detect and estimate the aquifer geometry and
