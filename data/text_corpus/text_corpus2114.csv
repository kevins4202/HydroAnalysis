10570,canola is a water stress tolerant crop which could be an alternative in areas with limited water resources however in arid and semi arid environments where rainfall events are scarce and increasingly erratic the use of irrigation is necessary for canola production to reach its maximum yield the goal of this study was to determine the crop evapotranspiration etc and crop coefficients of sprinkler irrigated canola brassica napus l under non limiting soil water content conditions a 2 year field experiment was conducted in the lysimeter facility located in albacete se spain a large weighing lysimeter 2 7 2 3 1 7 m with an accuracy of 0 04 mm equivalent water depth was used to measure the daily crop evapotranspiration etc rate throughout two growing seasons etc values were determined using daily mass change in the lysimeter cumulative etc was replaced in the lysimeter through sprinkler irrigation applications thus crop water stress was avoided seasonal lysimeter based measured canola etc was 472 and 602 mm in 2008 and 2012 respectively the 28 higher etc value in 2012 was mainly due to a much higher evaporative demand during the crop growth mid season period of 2012 the kc values were determined using grass reference evapotranspiration eto calculated with the fao56 penman monteith equation and the etc calculations from the lysimeter data the dual crop coefﬁcient approach was used to separate crop transpiration kcb from soil evaporation ke for the two canola seasons mid season kc and kcb values after fao56 climate adjustment were kc mid std 1 15 and kcb mid std 1 11 those values were reached coinciding with maximum fraction of ground cover fc values of up 0 95 and 0 97 for 2008 and 2012 respectively the seasonal evaporation component for sprinkler irrigated canola was estimated to be about 24 and 19 of etc in 2008 and 2012 respectively the good linear relationship found between canola kcb values and fc and the excellent agreement found between remotely sensed vegetation indices vis and different biophysical parameters such as kcb and fc will allow monitoring and estimating the spatially distributed water requirements of canola at field and regional scales using multispectral satellite imagery keywords et partitioning single and dual crop coefficient standard climate canopy cover vegetation indices fao56 approach 1 introduction canola brassica napus l is cultivated to produce forage vegetable oil for human consumption and biodiesel in different regions around the world globally the canola planted area reached nearly 35 million ha by 2017 with a production of 76 2 million mg worldwide canola is the second most cultivated oil crop after soybean faostat 2017 the main canola producers in the world are canada european union china india australia and the united states of america in europe canola is mainly cultivated to feed livestock due to its high fat content and medium protein content canola is a water stress tolerant crop and it is suitable for arid and semi arid areas pavlista et al 2016 in a previous study lópez urrea et al 2014 reported that energy crops are a promising cropping alternative in water scarce areas due to their adaptability to dry climatic conditions in the last two decades there has been a lack of robust studies focused on measuring canola crop evapotranspiration etc and in producing new canola crop coefficients for sprinkler irrigated fields therefore there is a need to determine canola evapotranspiration rates etc and crop coefficients kc under different climatic conditions agronomics irrigation systems and management e g full and limited irrigation to more precisely manage irrigation water and agricultural inputs to our knowledge there is a lack of studies addressing this wider canola etc characterization sánchez et al 2014 conducted two experimental campaigns to assess crop coefficients of sunflower and canola proposed by fao56 as well as those obtained from lysimeter measurements using a land surface two source energy balance and thermal radiometry approach furthermore the different methods available to determine canola etc and kc values e g eddy covariance bowen ratio energy balance remote sensing vegetation indices or soil water balance greatly influence their accuracy and applicability large weighing lysimeters with precise calibration and maintenance are critical for a robust etc and kc characterization the standard fao56 approach allen et al 1998 for estimating crop water requirements uses eto calculated with the fao56 penman monteith fao56 pm equation and a kc values of kc are obtained by measuring etc commonly with weighing lysimeters eddy covariance systems or a soil water balance approach and by relating etc to eto several kc values are available in the literature and recently kc values have been updated for many crops in pereira et al 2020a 2020b while the water requirements and kc of most important field crops have been studied in detail using weighing lysimeters the kc values of crops of less importance are often estimated based on fewer studies for those cases etc has commonly been determined with alternative methods e g eddy covariance bowen ratio soil water balance or remote sensing energy balance that have less accuracy and precision based on the error expected for different types of etc measurements systems as reported by allen et al 2011a thus it is necessary to determine the kc values for canola with the accuracy and precision provided by large weighing lysimetry under controlled irrigated and well management conditions weighing lysimeters are known to provide the most accurate and reliable measurements of etc and are then considered the standard for the assessment of different energy and water balance models as well as for the calibration of crop coefficients as indicated in the fao56 methodology chávez et al 2009 allen et al 2011a evett et al 2012 several previous lysimeter studies of kc were conducted for several different crops as wheat howell et al 1995 sánchez et al 2015 and sweet sorghum lópez urrea et al 2016 results from these studies were good determination of etc and produced updated crop coefficients pereira et al 2020a this issue 2020b submitted for publication according to allen et al 2011a the standards for accurate measurements of etc in a lysimeter are a a minimum of 50 m green fetch around the lysimeter area b similar conditions of crop height all throughout the lysimeter field c fraction of ground cover fc leaf area index lai water management and soil conditions that are similar inside and outside of the lysimeter in addition allen et al 1998 reported the standard methodology for calculating the effects of soil evaporation on the value of kc the procedure consists of splitting kc into two different coefficients one denominated basal crop coefficient kcb mainly related to crop transpiration and one for soil evaporation ke thereby the etc is calculated for pristine conditions as the product of a dual crop coefficient kcb ke with the grass reference evapotranspiration eto the actual kcb and kc can be estimated by remote sensing at field or from aerial platforms using an empirical approach from spectral reflectance they are the crop coefficients obtained from reflectance named hereafter kcb act rs and kc act rs characterized through vegetation indices vis derived from spectral reflectance that is based on actual field conditions pôças et al this issue these vis are mathematical combinations of surface or target vegetation reflectances over different spectral bands i e mostly in the visible and infrared domains of the electromagnetic spectrum vis are used to determine canopy biophysical variables e g height lai fc crop coefficients etc for instance the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi uses surface reflectance values obtained from the near infra red nir and red bands this index was developed by deering 1978 another index widely applied is the soil adjusted vegetation index savi huete 1988 based on a similar definition of ndvi but including a parameter l 0 5 to reduce the influence of the variation in soil color and brightness to develop the reflectance based cop coefficient approach the first step is to obtain spatially distributed crop canopy reflectance data using different spectral bands the remote sensing data are collected over the crop growth cycle i e from bare soil to effective canopy cover then vis are mathematically related to known crop coefficients for no stress conditions for the different crop growth stages these reflectance based actual crop coefficients kc act rs and kcb act rs can then be multiplied by eto values to determine actual crop evapotranspiration etc act the relationship between the basal crop coefficient and the vegetation indices vis are known since the late 80 s this relationship is based on the similar temporal behavior of both kcb fraction of ground cover fc and vis during the crop growth cycle grattan et al 1998 trout et al 2008 johnson and trout 2012 lópez urrea et al 2016 the most general model applied is based on a linear function providing the value of the actual kcb from the vi by means of an empirical calibration for the crop and its agro environmental conditions these models are widely used and provided low cost applications to determine with reasonable accuracy the water necessities to keep the crop under optimal conditions they have been applied to maize and wheat campos et al 2017 2018 cotton hunsaker et al 2003 gonzalez dugo and mateos 2008 potato jayanthi et al 2007 soybean sorghum and alfalfa singh and irmak 2009 orchards campos et al 2012 o connell et al 2011 campos et al 2016 odi lara et al 2016 bellvert et al 2018 and natural environments campos et al 2013 however this relationship is essentially non linear gonzalez dugo and mateos 2008 and it is dependent on the arrangement of leaves in the canopy crop architecture and the damping coefficient in the relationship between transpiration coefficient defined as the ratio of unstressed transpiration to crop maximum evapotranspiration for full ground cover and the vis steven et al 1986 choudhury et al 1994 for many crops and most used vis like ndvi and savi this relationship can be approximated to linear in most of the studied cases the estimation of the crop coefficients from remote sensing allow to extend the distributed water management at different levels and fields from plot scale to river basin calera et al 2017 garrido rubio et al 2019 this is a well known technique applied to precision farming nowadays due to its operational use considering the accessibility to a variety of multispectral field sensors or onboard of unmanned aerial vehicles as well as to high spatio temporal resolution satellite images calibrating models for a wider variety of crops becomes essential at this point this canola evapotranspiration study was carried out in a large precision weighing lysimeter facility located in a semi arid region albacete se spain to a measure the seasonal crop evapotranspiration of sprinkler irrigated canola under no soil water limitations during two crop growing seasons b determine single and dual crop coefficients for canola c obtain the relationship between canola basal crop coefficient kcb and the fraction of ground covered by the canopy fc and d relate canopy biophysical variables i e kcb and fc to vis 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site description and lysimeter measurements this work is based on experiments carried out during the 2008 and 2012 canola growing seasons at the itap lysimeter facility in albacete se spain 2 05 w 39 03 n 695 m a s l the soil is classified as petrocalcic calcixerepts soil survey staff 2014 average soil depth at the lysimeter field area is about 40 cm and is limited by the development of a somewhat fragmented petrocalcic horizon physical and chemical properties of the lysimeter soil at different depths were measured at the beginning of the experiment using twenty undisturbed soil samples soil texture is silty clay loam with 13 sand 49 silt and 38 clay with a basic ph 8 2 the soil has a content of organic matter nitrogen and active limestone of 2 8 0 13 and 11 1 respectively soil electrical conductivity ece was 0 2 ds m 1 so there was no problem with salinity in the soil our study site is located in a semi arid area with a temperate mediterranean climate with prevalent dry and warm summers long term average annual rainfall results 314 mm mostly concentrated in the spring and fall and average mean maximum and minimum temperatures are 13 7 24 0 and 4 5 c respectively weather records were obtained for the last 20 years 1988 2007 from a standard agricultural weather station located at the experimental site measurements of canola brassica napus l cv kabel etc were conducted with a large precision weighing lysimeter 2 7 m long 2 3 m wide and 1 7 m deep lópez urrea et al 2009a the lysimeter used in our experiment complies with all conditions required to guarantee the representativeness of etc measurements etc values were determined using daily mass change in the lysimeter soil inside the lysimeter was similar to the surrounding field soil with a limited rooting depth and thus irrigation was managed for only 40 cm of canola root depth in the root zone the water holding capacity and permanent wilting point was 134 mm and 82 mm respectively resulting in total available water of 54 mm irrigation was managed in the lysimeter to maintain non limiting soil water content thus irrigation was applied to replace etc when the lysimeter weight indicated that the soil water depletions ranged between 8 mm in the early initial stage and 24 mm for both experimental years therefore this irrigation water management strategy ensured that a maximum of 44 of the total available water was depleted the lysimeter is located in the center of a one ha plot 100 100 m where canola was sown on march 3rd and on march 30th in 2008 and 2012 respectively canola seeds were sown in 15 cm rows with a seed population of 155 seeds m 2 the plant population inside the lysimeter was identical to that of surrounding field thus allowing for representative measurements of etc conscientious efforts were made to keep the crop inside the lysimeter at the same height vegetation amount fraction of ground cover and growth stage as the crop outside and to minimize edge effects so that representativeness of the measurements could be guaranteed fig 1 presents four photographs illustrative of the vegetation in the lysimeter field at different growth stages during the two study canola growth seasons fertilizer was applied before sowing at a rate of 36 kg ha 1 of n 72 kg ha 1 of p2o5 and 36 kg ha 1 of k2o additionally liquid fertilizer was applied during the flowering period for a total of 50 kg ha 1 of n the canola seed was harvested on july 12th and on july 24th in 2008 and 2012 respectively the experimental plot was managed according to cultural practices normally carried out in the area to avoid pests and disease effects on crop performance the experimental field has a solid set sprinkler irrigation system with sprinklers placed on a grid of 15 12 5 m that provided an irrigation precipitation rate of 8 6 mm h 1 irrigation management in the lysimeter field followed the usual practice in the area for achieving maximum potential yields irrigation was applied using the sprinkler system every 2 21 days in 2008 and every 2 10 days in 2012 based on the etc and rainfall amounts measured a total of 21 and 30 irrigations were applied throughout the 2008 and 2012 seasons respectively the lysimeter soil containing tank sits on a system of beams and counterbalances that offsets the dead weight of the soil and the tank and reduces the load on the beam by 1000 1 the lysimeter mass was determined using a data logger cr10x campbell scientific ltd logan utah usa that recorded the lysimeter steel load cell model sb2 epelsa ind spain signal at 1 s frequency the load cell signal was averaged over a 5 min periods and was summed to compose 15 min hourly and daily means the lysimeter mass resolution is 0 02 mm with an accuracy of 0 04 mm equivalent water depth for further information about the technical features of the lysimeter the reader is referred to lópez urrea et al 2006 data collected during precipitation events weight and calibration verifications or any other works on the surface of the lysimeter tank were discarded quality assessment and quality control procedures for etc measurements in the lysimeter were conducted following the recommendations reported by allen et al 2011b 2 2 weather station reference evapotranspiration and crop coefficients weather conditions during the two study seasons were measured with an automated agrometeorological station located over a 1 5 ha reference grass surface that was located less than 100 m from the canola lysimeter field all sensors were installed at a height 1 5 2 m above the grass surface meteorological data were registered every 15 min and also hourly and daily variables measured were as follows air temperature relative humidity horizontal wind speed wind direction shortwave incoming and longwave outgoing radiation and rainfall all data were stored in two dataloggers model cr10x campbell scientific instrument logan utah usa additional information about sensors installed at the weather station is provided in lópez urrea et al 2012 daily eto values were calculated using the fao56 pm reference et equation allen et al 1998 previous lysimeter studies conducted at the same location pointed out the good performance of the fao56 pm eto method lópez urrea et al 2006 trigo et al 2018 the kc values for the canola were determined using the calculated eto values and the etc measurements in the lysimeter the kcb was estimated following the standard fao56 dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 as the difference between kc values calculated from the lysimeter minus ke values calculated with the fao56 methodology lópez urrea et al 2009b the values of the main parameters used to compute ke were total evaporable water tew 25 mm readily evaporable water rew 10 mm fraction of soil surface wetted fw by sprinkler irrigation 1 0 and by precipitation 1 0 additionally kc max evaporation reduction coefficient kr and exposed and wetted soil fraction few were calculated using the equations proposed by allen et al 1998 the kc mid and kcb mid values observed in the lysimeter were adjusted to a standard temperate climate i e sub humid climate with moderate wind speed characterized by minimum relative humidity rhmin of 45 and wind speed u2 of 2 m s 1 using the equation reported by allen et al 1998 however kc end and kcb end values did not require this adjustment since they were lower than 0 45 pereira et al 2020a 2 3 fraction of ground cover crop height and field radiometry three separate sub areas within the field representative of the canola plantation were selected to monitor the crop development during the 2008 and 2012 seasons the fraction of ground covered by the canopy fc and crop height h were measured about every 7 10 days starting at crop emergence until harvest digital photographic images were periodically acquired at solar noon and vertically nadir looking from 4 m height to determine fc a supervised classification technique was used with the maximum probability algorithm to assign the current classes of green vegetation in the image following the methodology described in cihlar et al 1987 these punctual ground measurements were then used to model fc for the entire season in the modeling of fc third order polynomial regressions were used for crop development and late seasons fittings whereas a fixed top value was assigned for mid season fig 2 in coincidence with the acquisition of the biophysical parameters i e kcb and fc the crop was monitored using remote sensing sensors during the year 2012 for which 23 reflectance measurements in the spectral range 350 2500 nm band width of 3 nm in the visible and 8 5 nm in the infrared were acquired during the crop growth cycle from april 17th to july 18th about 2 measurements per week the equipment used was a fieldspec 3 hires asd malvern panalytical ltd almelo netherlands spectroradiometer a total number of 6 spectral samples were acquired over the lysimeter and other 6 were repeated in the surrounding area in order to check the representativeness of the vegetation cover in the entire plot the observing circular footprint area of the radiometer has a diameter of 3 m as a result of setting the instrument on a crane at height of 7 m over the target vegetation the sequence of spectral acquisitions was done during the local central time of the day at solar noon calibrating for the incoming radiation with a spectralon lambertian surface the linear regressions or equations found for the 2012 data analysis fig 7 were applied to the 2008 fc data then the vis obtained for 2008 were included in the analysis in order to be more consistent using the derived linear regressions relationships between kcb act and vis fig 8 the relationship between the fraction of ground cover and vegetation indices has been widely studied using several different crops in different parts of the world for instance the non linear behavior of fc and vis is better described by the general basic models proposed by choudhury et al 1994 gonzalez dugo and mateos 2008 and gilabert et al 2011 1 1 f c ξ v i m a x v i v i m a x v i m i n where ξ is a damping coefficient that depends on arrangement of leaves in the canopy and leaf angle distribution v i m a x and v i m i n are the maximum and minimum values of the vi during the crop cycle the basal crop coefficient can be obtained from the surface crop reflectance named kcb act rs by means of the relationship with the vis in a similar way choudhury et al 1994 gonzalez dugo and mateos 2008 gilabert et al 2011 2 k c b a c t r s k c b m a x 1 v i m a x v i v i m a x v i m i n η where kcbmax is the maximum value reached during the cycle and η is a coefficient that varies with the arrangement of leaves in the canopy both biophysical variables kcb and fc are related taking into account the previous functions giving 3 k c b k c b m a x 1 1 f c ζ η in both vegetation indices the product η ξ 1 and the fit can be approximated to linear with good results 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analysis was conducted with microsoft excel 2013 computer software liengme 2015 a linear regression analysis was performed among fc and kcb and to relate canopy biophysical variables to vis in order to assess the degree of relationship based on the coefficient of determination r2 in addition the standard deviation error assessment of the crop coefficients fig 4 and vegetation indices fig 6 was calculated 3 results 3 1 meteorological conditions table 1 shows the meteorological conditions for each month during the 2008 and 2012 canola growing seasons monthly averages of air temperature ranged between 7 8 23 6 c and wind speed between 2 3 4 5 m s 1 cumulative rainfall resulted 177 mm in 2008 mainly concentrated in may june whereas only 115 mm was registered in 2012 concentrated in march april in this case overall both growing seasons at the itap lysimeter facility albacete were typical of the long term average weather conditions in the southeast of spain although the rainfall during the two seasons was about 22 higher and 20 lower than the 20 year mean in 2008 and 2012 respectively in terms of temperature note may june in 2012 was almost 3 c warmer than the same period in 2008 as a consequence the average evaporative demand was higher in 2012 than in 2008 this difference is concentrated in the months of may and june 3 2 crop development evapotranspiration values and applied irrigation water the maximum fraction of ground cover in this study was reached about 75 and 60 days after planting in 2008 and 2012 respectively late planting in 2012 produced a faster development than in 2008 likely due to canola being sown 27 days later in 2012 than in 2008 under near optimal temperatures in 2008 canola crop height h reached 1 0 m and the maximum canopy cover 0 95 in mid may in 2012 maximum fc 0 97 and h 1 0 m were reached in late may about 10 days later than in 2008 due to the later planting in 2008 the dates of critical growth stages were emergence cotyledons emerge through soil surface on march 17 5 6 leaves unfolded on april 23 and flowering first flowers open on may 19 in 2012 these stages were emergence on april 13 5 6 leaves unfolded on may 11 and flowering on june 3 lancashire et al 1991 in both growing seasons emergence was reached 15 days after planting dap during the initial growth stage the crop reached 5 6 leaves stage during the crop development phase 52 and 43 dap in 2008 and 2012 respectively flowering was reached 78 dap in 2008 and 66 dap in 2012 coinciding with the mid season growth stage dates of sowing and harvest are available in section 2 1 seed yields were around 2400 and 2700 kg ha 1 in 2008 and 2012 growing seasons respectively these are typical yields close to average under sprinkler irrigated conditions in spain the seed yield and the water applied were very similar in the lysimeter surface effective area and at the surrounding field area the crop water productivity for seed yield defined as the ratio between the seed yield and etc trout and dejonge 2017 resulted 0 51 kg m 3 and 0 45 kg m 3 in 2008 and 2012 respectively reference evapotranspiration eto during the canola growing seasons from sowing to harvest was 604 mm in 2008 and 661 mm in 2012 table 2 although 2008 canola growing season was 15 days longer than that of 2012 eto was higher in 2012 primarily due to higher evaporative demand and drier conditions during the mid crop growth season this year in 2008 maximum eto occurred in the late season from mid june to mid july whereas in 2012 maximum eto happened during the mid season stage this also responds to the main rainfall periods for both years mentioned above fig 3 shows the daily canola etc data and the water input from irrigation and rainfall for the 2008 and 2012 seasons etc values increased quickly as the crop development period progressed due to the fast increase of the canopy cover facilitated by the favorable spring temperatures peak etc was reached around mid season coinciding with the maximum fraction of ground cover values and declined during late season stage as green canopy cover dropped seasonal lysimeter based canola etc was 472 and 602 mm in 2008 and 2012 respectively the 28 higher etc value in 2012 was due to a higher evaporative demand during this season mainly during the period of maximum canola water requirements i e mid season when the eto value was a 74 higher in 2012 than in 2008 boosted because this period was about 15 days later in 2012 than in 2008 coinciding with the high temperatures of late spring and early summer thus a larger number of irrigation events larger cumulative seasonal water depth were needed in 2012 than in 2008 the accumulated irrigation supply was 298 mm in 2008 and 538 mm in 2012 resulting in a total irrigation plus rainfall of 472 mm and 602 mm in 2008 and 2012 respectively according to the irrigation management in the lysimeter previously described only the needed amount of water used was restored in the root zone thus no deep percolation drainage was recorded from the lysimeter tank during the experiment 3 3 single and dual crop coefficient curves fig 4 shows the kc data during the two canola growing periods calculated as the ratio of the lysimeter etc measurements and eto calculated with the fao56 pm equation these kc values were adjusted to the fao56 segmented crop coefficient curve average kc obs which consist of four linear segments representative of the four canola growth stages typical kc values for initial kc ini mid season kc mid and end season kc end are shown in table 2 kc values during crop development and late season stages are linearly interpolated with time the maximum average kc values of 1 15 in 2008 and 1 24 in 2012 were reached in the mid season stage the kc mid value was lower in 2008 than in 2012 mainly due to the drier weather conditions in 2012 lower minimum relative humidity in the two study years four distinct growth stages were identified in the seasonal changes in kc in the first stage initial the kc ini values had a higher dispersion due to the effect of soil evaporation after a rainfall and or irrigation event when the ground cover values were low in the second stage crop development the daily kc values increased and maximum values were reached as the plants reached maximum cover which coincided with the initial mid season stage in the third stage mid season the kc mid values were high and more or less constant and in the fourth stage late season as leaves began to age and senescence there was a continuous decrease in daily canola kc until it reached a lower value at the end of the growing period denominated kc end the importance of the soil evaporation component was evaluated by using the dual crop coefficient approach that separates crop transpiration estimated by the basal crop coefficient kcb and soil evaporation evaporation coefficient ke the soil water evaporation becomes significant after a rainfall event or sprinkler irrigation application this is the case particularly during the initial crop growth stage when the fraction of ground surface covered by vegetation is negligible or small and when short wave radiation reaches the soil surface results shown in fig 5 and in table 3 show ke values were greater during initial and beginning of the crop development stages as well as immediately following rainfall or irrigation events when the soil surface turned to wet and a high energy flux reached the surface and was available for the soil water evaporation process the ke values increased during the late season period due to the decreasing values of fc in that period crop senescence as the crop canopy expanded kcb values increased while the ke values decreased the seasonal evaporation component amounted to 113 mm and 112 mm in 2008 and 2012 respectively corresponding to 24 and 19 of etc in 2008 and 2012 respectively crop transpiration was estimated by multiplying eto by kcb resulting values of 359 mm in 2008 and 494 mm in 2012 kcb values during development and late season crop growth periods are linearly interpolated with time fig 5 also shows the kcb values adjusted to the fao56 four segment crop coefficient curve average kcb obs table 4 presents a summary of the observed crop coefficients kc and kcb derived from lysimeter measurements for mid and end seasons obs subindex and respective values adjusted to standard temperate climate rh min 45 and u2 2 m s 1 std subindex in addition table 4 includes observed ancillary crop parameters for irrigated canola namely maximum root depth zr max maximum crop height h max and maximum fraction of ground cover fc max values of kc end obs and kcb end obs did not require to be adjusted to standard climate conditions as they remained below 0 45 for both years 3 4 relationship between kcb and fc and relate these biophysical variables to vis fig 6 shows the evolution of canola ndvi and savi measured with the asd spectroradiometer during the 2012 canola season both vis curves capture adequately the canola crop growth describing the crop development period from on days after planting dap 30 green up to 52 the mid season from dap 52 to 90 and the late season from dap 90 to 117 fig 7 shows the linear relationship between ndvi and savi with the fraction of ground covered by the canopy fc the savi linear function presents a somewhat better fit less scattering than the ndvi based function because savi minimizes the soil background reflectance noise for the ndvi graphical plot scattering increases for lower to mid values corresponding to a larger soil background exposure fig 8 shows the global linear fit for the complete set including both years in the case of the estimation of kcb based on ndvi and savi fig 8 obtained with the ground based radiometer the savi based kcb function resulted slightly better based on the coefficient of determination and the interception of the linear regression than the ndvi one it is interesting to plot the behavior of the kcb act rs along the development of the crop comparing with the measured kcb values determined from lysimeter measurements and ke values estimated with the fao56 approach fig 10 during the first part of the development the predicted values of kcb act rs are slightly over the real ones after maturation they are slightly below 4 discussion 4 1 canola evapotranspiration and crop coefficients in previous works allen et al 1998 2007 reported canola kc values adjusted to standard climate conditions rhmin 45 and u2 2 m s 1 of kc ini 0 35 kc mid 1 0 1 15 lower value corresponding to rainfed canola with a lower plant population density kc end 0 35 the kc mid and kc end matched our measurements whereas the small differences in the kc ini can be due to the higher evaporation during the initial growth stage in our experiments that most likely occurred due to the rapid canola growth during the early crop growth stage larger soil heat units these authors reported canola kcb values of kcb ini 0 15 kcb mid 0 95 1 10 the lower value for rainfed conditions kcb end 0 25 these kcb values are in agreement with our estimations although our kcb end value is slightly lower 0 20 probably due to the longer duration of senescence in our study beyond fao 56 publication allen et al 1998 studies focused on measuring canola water requirements and deriving new canola crop coefficients are quite scarce in addition some of these studies lack the required information supporting the reported crop coefficients in a lysimeter experiment conducted in north east of bloemfontein south africa dlamini et al 2016 determined the reduction of soil evaporation using plastic and gravel mulches and evaluated the effectiveness of gravel mulch for e t partition under arid climate conditions plastic and gravel mulches reduced e by 36 47 and 33 41 respectively canola transpiration measured with the unmulched lysimeters ranged between 716 and 718 mm whereas e ranged between 42 and 48 mm the higher seasonal canola etc compared to our study was likely due to higher evaporative demand conditions at bloemfontein arid climate however the irrigation system used drip irrigation produced lower e compared with the e values obtained in our study based on a sprinkler irrigation system in a previous research over the same lysimeter facility sánchez et al 2014 compared three methodologies weighing lysimeter simplified two source energy balance stseb model and fao56 and reported discrepancies in the kc values obtained from lysimeter measurements stseb model outputs and those suggested by fao56 however measured kc values were not adjusted to fao four stages curve and kc mid values were not adjusted to a temperate standard climate differences among reports arise also in terms of seasonal canola etc and even among different growing seasons in the same study due to different weather conditions growing season duration or crop varieties and the diversity of canola production systems all over the world furthermore in the few studies available in the literature reporting canola crop coefficients kc mid and kc end values were not adjusted to standard climate conditions making it difficult to transfer them to other regions 4 2 relationships between kcb and fc and vis the relationship between faction of ground cover fc and vegetation indices has been widely studied for many crops that in case of canola the ndvimax 0 93 ndvimin 0 15 and ξ 0 997 and for savi this relationship is savimax 0 75 savimin 0 1 and and ξ 0 994 the value of ξ greater than 1 implies a saturation of the vi near the high values of fc and it agrees with the results obtained in this crop with no appreciable saturation observed fig 7 in this vegetation the maximum crop height is about 1 0 m and the saturation due to the multiple scatter of radiation on nir range inside the different layers in the crop is not enough to show appreciable saturation of the index those results show that the linear relationship approximation is feasible in this crop with good fit this linear relationship is in agreement with other crops like maize and wheat under similar crop architecture with good results applied at satellite level to describe the crop phenology gonzález gómez et al 2018 very similar relationship fc 1 26 ndvi 0 18 was proposed by johnson and trout 2012 for a general model including 18 different crops including row crops orchards grain and vineyards the maximum value of kcb reached during the cycle kcbmax in this case is 1 2 for the ndvi the ndvimax 0 93 the ndvimin 0 15 providing the best fit a value of η 1 05 r2 0 93 in the case of savi the savimax 0 75 savimin 0 10 obtaining for the dumping coefficient η 1 10 this behavior in both indices with the coefficient η close to 1 is in agreement of the approximation of linear fit in canola data observing a saturation in this relationship for values near the maximum of kcb this relationship is controversial but the last works focusing on their validation on applied systems to determine et and its use on advisory irrigation services show consistent results calera et al 2017 calera et al 2017 reviewed linear and polynomial approaches to kcb from ndvi and savi in different row crops maize wheat cotton sugar beet and row vineyard showing slopes in the range of the linear model for canola obtained in our experiment in addition the ndvi function for canola kcb resulted with similar fitting values than those found for cotton pre full cover in arizona usa by hunsaker et al 2003 according to johnson and trout 2012 a more robust approach to characterize kcb using vegetation reflectance or vis is to use the fraction of ground cover fc since ndvi saturates at lai values around 5 m2 m 2 and as was observed in this experiment near the maximum values in savi thus kcb for canola was related to fc fig 9 below depicts the much better linear function obtained with kcb values tight around the fitted curve high coefficient of determination and small slope and intercept therefore using the kcb fc function is recommended over the ones based on ndvi or savi the comparison of basal crop coefficients calculated using vis kcb act rs with the observed ones kcb lysimeter shows a slight overestimation during the initial period fig 10 the different status of the cover between the initial stage and senescence affects the interaction with the radiation and thus the value of the vis considering the same observing and illumination geometry along the crop cycle the reflected radiation of the cover is different in the red band that is mostly absorbed while the nir is partially transmitted to lower layers affecting the value of the vis for the same kcb value due to different crop leaf structure on both periods of the cycle during the crop development stage most of the leaves on the lower layers of the cover are green having photosynthetic activity and this may have an appreciable effect on linearity increasing slightly nir reflectance and the value of the vis 5 conclusions a large weighing lysimeter was used to measure etc and produce crop coefficients for sprinkler irrigated canola in the southeast of spain under semi arid mediterranean weather conditions the results show high water requirements of this crop mainly for the late planting season which could compromise its use in areas with scarcity of water resources single and basal crop coefficient values for mid season were adjusted to standard temperate climate conditions making it possible to transfer them to other areas under different weather conditions the fraction of ground cover fc based kcb function shows that measuring fc is a reliable and likely the most transferrable approach to estimate kcb values of canola estimation and monitoring of spatially distributed water requirements of canola crop at both field and regional scales will benefit from the close relations found among vegetation indices and biophysical parameters relevant for crop management such as kcb and fc in addition the kc act rs methodology applied indicates that it is feasible for the canola crop to estimate kc kcb through the kc act rs kcb act rs method this approach is an enhancement of the fao56 kc approach because captures within season sudden climatic environmental management stress changes and thus assists farmers in identifying potential problems and in developing corrective actions it can be concluded that the outcome of this study provides specific guidelines to estimate canola etc using updated crop coefficients and a remote sensing based procedure to characterize actual crop field conditions which will contribute to a better irrigation

10570,canola is a water stress tolerant crop which could be an alternative in areas with limited water resources however in arid and semi arid environments where rainfall events are scarce and increasingly erratic the use of irrigation is necessary for canola production to reach its maximum yield the goal of this study was to determine the crop evapotranspiration etc and crop coefficients of sprinkler irrigated canola brassica napus l under non limiting soil water content conditions a 2 year field experiment was conducted in the lysimeter facility located in albacete se spain a large weighing lysimeter 2 7 2 3 1 7 m with an accuracy of 0 04 mm equivalent water depth was used to measure the daily crop evapotranspiration etc rate throughout two growing seasons etc values were determined using daily mass change in the lysimeter cumulative etc was replaced in the lysimeter through sprinkler irrigation applications thus crop water stress was avoided seasonal lysimeter based measured canola etc was 472 and 602 mm in 2008 and 2012 respectively the 28 higher etc value in 2012 was mainly due to a much higher evaporative demand during the crop growth mid season period of 2012 the kc values were determined using grass reference evapotranspiration eto calculated with the fao56 penman monteith equation and the etc calculations from the lysimeter data the dual crop coefﬁcient approach was used to separate crop transpiration kcb from soil evaporation ke for the two canola seasons mid season kc and kcb values after fao56 climate adjustment were kc mid std 1 15 and kcb mid std 1 11 those values were reached coinciding with maximum fraction of ground cover fc values of up 0 95 and 0 97 for 2008 and 2012 respectively the seasonal evaporation component for sprinkler irrigated canola was estimated to be about 24 and 19 of etc in 2008 and 2012 respectively the good linear relationship found between canola kcb values and fc and the excellent agreement found between remotely sensed vegetation indices vis and different biophysical parameters such as kcb and fc will allow monitoring and estimating the spatially distributed water requirements of canola at field and regional scales using multispectral satellite imagery keywords et partitioning single and dual crop coefficient standard climate canopy cover vegetation indices fao56 approach 1 introduction canola brassica napus l is cultivated to produce forage vegetable oil for human consumption and biodiesel in different regions around the world globally the canola planted area reached nearly 35 million ha by 2017 with a production of 76 2 million mg worldwide canola is the second most cultivated oil crop after soybean faostat 2017 the main canola producers in the world are canada european union china india australia and the united states of america in europe canola is mainly cultivated to feed livestock due to its high fat content and medium protein content canola is a water stress tolerant crop and it is suitable for arid and semi arid areas pavlista et al 2016 in a previous study lópez urrea et al 2014 reported that energy crops are a promising cropping alternative in water scarce areas due to their adaptability to dry climatic conditions in the last two decades there has been a lack of robust studies focused on measuring canola crop evapotranspiration etc and in producing new canola crop coefficients for sprinkler irrigated fields therefore there is a need to determine canola evapotranspiration rates etc and crop coefficients kc under different climatic conditions agronomics irrigation systems and management e g full and limited irrigation to more precisely manage irrigation water and agricultural inputs to our knowledge there is a lack of studies addressing this wider canola etc characterization sánchez et al 2014 conducted two experimental campaigns to assess crop coefficients of sunflower and canola proposed by fao56 as well as those obtained from lysimeter measurements using a land surface two source energy balance and thermal radiometry approach furthermore the different methods available to determine canola etc and kc values e g eddy covariance bowen ratio energy balance remote sensing vegetation indices or soil water balance greatly influence their accuracy and applicability large weighing lysimeters with precise calibration and maintenance are critical for a robust etc and kc characterization the standard fao56 approach allen et al 1998 for estimating crop water requirements uses eto calculated with the fao56 penman monteith fao56 pm equation and a kc values of kc are obtained by measuring etc commonly with weighing lysimeters eddy covariance systems or a soil water balance approach and by relating etc to eto several kc values are available in the literature and recently kc values have been updated for many crops in pereira et al 2020a 2020b while the water requirements and kc of most important field crops have been studied in detail using weighing lysimeters the kc values of crops of less importance are often estimated based on fewer studies for those cases etc has commonly been determined with alternative methods e g eddy covariance bowen ratio soil water balance or remote sensing energy balance that have less accuracy and precision based on the error expected for different types of etc measurements systems as reported by allen et al 2011a thus it is necessary to determine the kc values for canola with the accuracy and precision provided by large weighing lysimetry under controlled irrigated and well management conditions weighing lysimeters are known to provide the most accurate and reliable measurements of etc and are then considered the standard for the assessment of different energy and water balance models as well as for the calibration of crop coefficients as indicated in the fao56 methodology chávez et al 2009 allen et al 2011a evett et al 2012 several previous lysimeter studies of kc were conducted for several different crops as wheat howell et al 1995 sánchez et al 2015 and sweet sorghum lópez urrea et al 2016 results from these studies were good determination of etc and produced updated crop coefficients pereira et al 2020a this issue 2020b submitted for publication according to allen et al 2011a the standards for accurate measurements of etc in a lysimeter are a a minimum of 50 m green fetch around the lysimeter area b similar conditions of crop height all throughout the lysimeter field c fraction of ground cover fc leaf area index lai water management and soil conditions that are similar inside and outside of the lysimeter in addition allen et al 1998 reported the standard methodology for calculating the effects of soil evaporation on the value of kc the procedure consists of splitting kc into two different coefficients one denominated basal crop coefficient kcb mainly related to crop transpiration and one for soil evaporation ke thereby the etc is calculated for pristine conditions as the product of a dual crop coefficient kcb ke with the grass reference evapotranspiration eto the actual kcb and kc can be estimated by remote sensing at field or from aerial platforms using an empirical approach from spectral reflectance they are the crop coefficients obtained from reflectance named hereafter kcb act rs and kc act rs characterized through vegetation indices vis derived from spectral reflectance that is based on actual field conditions pôças et al this issue these vis are mathematical combinations of surface or target vegetation reflectances over different spectral bands i e mostly in the visible and infrared domains of the electromagnetic spectrum vis are used to determine canopy biophysical variables e g height lai fc crop coefficients etc for instance the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi uses surface reflectance values obtained from the near infra red nir and red bands this index was developed by deering 1978 another index widely applied is the soil adjusted vegetation index savi huete 1988 based on a similar definition of ndvi but including a parameter l 0 5 to reduce the influence of the variation in soil color and brightness to develop the reflectance based cop coefficient approach the first step is to obtain spatially distributed crop canopy reflectance data using different spectral bands the remote sensing data are collected over the crop growth cycle i e from bare soil to effective canopy cover then vis are mathematically related to known crop coefficients for no stress conditions for the different crop growth stages these reflectance based actual crop coefficients kc act rs and kcb act rs can then be multiplied by eto values to determine actual crop evapotranspiration etc act the relationship between the basal crop coefficient and the vegetation indices vis are known since the late 80 s this relationship is based on the similar temporal behavior of both kcb fraction of ground cover fc and vis during the crop growth cycle grattan et al 1998 trout et al 2008 johnson and trout 2012 lópez urrea et al 2016 the most general model applied is based on a linear function providing the value of the actual kcb from the vi by means of an empirical calibration for the crop and its agro environmental conditions these models are widely used and provided low cost applications to determine with reasonable accuracy the water necessities to keep the crop under optimal conditions they have been applied to maize and wheat campos et al 2017 2018 cotton hunsaker et al 2003 gonzalez

2018 and natural environments campos et al 2013 however this relationship is essentially non linear gonzalez dugo and mateos 2008 and it is dependent on the arrangement of leaves in the canopy crop architecture and the damping coefficient in the relationship between transpiration coefficient defined as the ratio of unstressed transpiration to crop maximum evapotranspiration for full ground cover and the vis steven et al 1986 choudhury et al 1994 for many crops and most used vis like ndvi and savi this relationship can be approximated to linear in most of the studied cases the estimation of the crop coefficients from remote sensing allow to extend the distributed water management at different levels and fields from plot scale to river basin calera et al 2017 garrido rubio et al 2019 this is a well known technique applied to precision farming nowadays due to its operational use considering the accessibility to a variety of multispectral field sensors or onboard of unmanned aerial vehicles as well as to high spatio temporal resolution satellite images calibrating models for a wider variety of crops becomes essential at this point this canola evapotranspiration study was carried out in a large precision weighing lysimeter facility located in a semi arid region albacete se spain to a measure the seasonal crop evapotranspiration of sprinkler irrigated canola under no soil water

carried out during the 2008 and 2012 canola growing seasons at the itap lysimeter facility in albacete se spain 2 05 w 39 03 n 695 m a s l the soil is classified as petrocalcic calcixerepts soil survey staff 2014 average soil depth at the lysimeter field area is about 40 cm and is limited by the development of a somewhat fragmented petrocalcic horizon physical and chemical properties of the lysimeter soil at different depths were measured at the beginning of the experiment using twenty undisturbed soil samples soil texture is silty clay loam with 13 sand 49 silt and 38 clay with a basic ph 8 2 the soil has a content of organic matter nitrogen and active limestone of 2 8 0 13 and 11 1 respectively soil electrical conductivity ece was 0 2 ds m 1 so there was no problem with salinity in the soil our study site is located in a semi arid area with a temperate mediterranean climate with prevalent dry and warm summers long term average annual rainfall results 314 mm mostly concentrated in the spring and fall and average mean maximum and minimum temperatures are 13 7 24 0 and 4 5 c respectively weather records were obtained for the last 20 years 1988 2007 from a standard agricultural weather station located at the experimental site measurements of canola brassica napus l cv kabel etc were conducted with a large precision weighing lysimeter 2 7 m long 2 3 m wide and 1 7 m deep lópez urrea et al 2009a the lysimeter used in our experiment complies with all conditions required to guarantee the representativeness of etc measurements etc values were determined using daily mass change in the lysimeter soil inside the lysimeter was similar to the surrounding field soil with a limited rooting depth and thus irrigation was managed for only 40 cm of canola root depth in the root zone the water holding capacity and permanent wilting point was 134 mm and 82 mm respectively resulting in total available water of 54 mm irrigation was managed in the lysimeter to maintain non limiting soil water content thus irrigation was applied to replace etc when the lysimeter weight indicated that the soil water depletions ranged between 8 mm in the early initial stage and 24 mm for both experimental years therefore this irrigation water management strategy ensured that a maximum of 44 of the total available water was depleted the lysimeter is located in the center of a one ha plot 100 100 m where canola was sown on march 3rd and on march 30th in 2008 and 2012 respectively canola seeds were sown in 15 cm rows with a seed population of 155 seeds m 2 the plant population inside the lysimeter was identical to that of surrounding field thus allowing for representative measurements of etc conscientious efforts were made to keep the crop inside the lysimeter at the same height vegetation amount fraction of ground cover and growth stage as the crop outside and to minimize edge effects so that representativeness of the measurements could be guaranteed fig 1 presents four photographs illustrative of the vegetation in the lysimeter field at different growth stages during the two study canola growth seasons fertilizer was applied before sowing at a rate of 36 kg ha 1 of n 72 kg ha 1 of p2o5 and 36 kg ha 1 of k2o additionally liquid fertilizer was applied during the flowering period for a total of 50 kg ha 1 of n the canola seed was harvested on july 12th and on july 24th in 2008 and 2012 respectively the experimental plot was managed according to cultural practices normally carried out in the area to avoid pests and disease effects on crop performance the experimental field has a solid set sprinkler irrigation system with sprinklers placed on a grid of 15 12 5 m that provided an irrigation precipitation rate of 8 6 mm h 1 irrigation management in the lysimeter field followed the usual practice in the area for achieving maximum potential yields irrigation was applied using the sprinkler system every 2 21 days in 2008 and every 2 10 days in 2012 based on the etc and rainfall amounts measured a total of 21 and 30 irrigations were applied throughout the 2008 and 2012 seasons respectively the lysimeter soil containing tank sits on a system of beams and counterbalances that offsets the dead weight of the soil and the tank and reduces the load on the beam by 1000 1 the lysimeter mass was determined using a data logger cr10x campbell scientific ltd logan utah usa that recorded the lysimeter steel load cell model sb2 epelsa ind spain signal at 1 s frequency the load cell signal was averaged over a 5 min periods and was summed to compose 15 min hourly and daily means the lysimeter mass resolution is 0 02 mm with an accuracy of 0 04 mm equivalent water depth for further information about the technical features of the lysimeter the reader is referred to lópez urrea et al 2006 data collected during precipitation events weight and calibration verifications or any other works on the surface of the lysimeter tank were discarded quality assessment and quality control procedures for etc measurements in the lysimeter were conducted following the recommendations reported by allen et al 2011b 2 2 weather station reference evapotranspiration and crop coefficients weather conditions during the two study seasons were measured with an automated agrometeorological station located over a 1 5 ha reference grass surface that was located less than 100 m from the canola lysimeter field all sensors were installed at a height 1 5 2 m above the grass surface meteorological data were registered every 15 min and also hourly and daily variables measured were as follows air temperature relative humidity horizontal wind speed wind direction shortwave incoming and longwave outgoing radiation and rainfall all data were stored in two dataloggers model cr10x campbell scientific instrument logan utah usa additional information about sensors installed at the weather station is provided in lópez urrea et al 2012 daily eto values were calculated using the fao56 pm reference et equation allen et al 1998 previous lysimeter studies conducted at the same location pointed out the good performance of the fao56 pm eto method lópez urrea et al 2006 trigo et al 2018 the kc values for the canola were determined using the calculated eto values and the etc measurements in the lysimeter the kcb was estimated following the standard fao56 dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 as the difference between kc values calculated from the lysimeter minus ke values calculated with the fao56 methodology lópez urrea et al 2009b the values of the main parameters used to compute ke were total evaporable water tew 25 mm readily evaporable water rew 10 mm fraction of soil surface wetted fw by sprinkler irrigation 1 0 and by precipitation 1 0 additionally kc max evaporation reduction coefficient kr and exposed and wetted soil fraction few were calculated using the equations proposed by allen et al 1998 the kc mid and kcb mid values observed in the lysimeter were adjusted to a standard temperate climate i e sub humid climate with moderate wind speed characterized by minimum relative humidity rhmin of 45 and wind speed u2 of 2 m s 1 using the equation reported by allen et al 1998 however kc end and kcb end values did not require this adjustment since they were lower than 0 45 pereira et al 2020a 2 3 fraction of ground cover crop height and field radiometry three separate sub areas within the field representative of the canola plantation were selected to monitor the crop development during the 2008 and 2012 seasons the fraction of ground covered by the canopy fc and crop height h were measured about every 7 10 days starting at crop emergence until harvest digital photographic images were periodically acquired at solar noon and vertically nadir looking from 4 m height to determine fc a supervised classification technique was used with the maximum probability algorithm to assign the current classes of green vegetation in the image following the methodology described in cihlar et al 1987 these punctual ground measurements were then used to model fc for the entire season in the modeling of fc third order polynomial regressions were used for crop development and late seasons fittings whereas a fixed top value was assigned for mid season fig 2 in coincidence with the acquisition of the biophysical parameters i e kcb and fc the crop was monitored using remote sensing sensors during the year 2012 for which 23 reflectance measurements in the spectral range 350 2500 nm band width of 3 nm in the visible and 8 5 nm in the infrared were acquired during the crop growth cycle from april 17th to july 18th about 2 measurements per week the equipment used was a fieldspec 3 hires asd malvern panalytical ltd almelo netherlands spectroradiometer a total number of 6 spectral samples were acquired over the lysimeter and other 6 were repeated in the surrounding area in order to check the representativeness of the vegetation cover in the entire plot the observing circular footprint area of the radiometer has a diameter of 3 m as a result of setting the instrument on a crane at height of 7 m over the target vegetation the sequence of spectral acquisitions was done during the local central time of the day at solar noon calibrating for the incoming radiation with a spectralon lambertian surface the linear regressions or equations found for the 2012 data analysis fig 7 were applied to the 2008 fc data then the vis obtained for 2008 were included in the analysis in order to be more consistent using the derived linear regressions relationships between kcb act and vis fig 8 the relationship between the fraction of ground cover and vegetation indices has been widely studied using several different crops in different parts of the world for instance the non linear behavior of fc and vis is better described by the general basic models proposed by choudhury et al 1994 gonzalez dugo and mateos 2008 and gilabert et al 2011 1 1 f c ξ v i m a x v i v i m a x v i m i n where ξ is a damping coefficient that depends on arrangement of leaves in the canopy and leaf angle distribution v i m a x and v i m i n are the maximum and minimum values of the vi during the crop cycle the basal crop coefficient can be obtained from the surface crop reflectance named kcb act rs by means of the relationship with the vis in a similar way choudhury et al 1994 gonzalez dugo and mateos 2008 gilabert et al 2011 2 k c b a c t r s k c b m a x 1 v i m a x v i v i m a x v i m i n η where kcbmax is the maximum value reached during the cycle and η is a coefficient that varies with the arrangement of leaves in the canopy both biophysical variables kcb and fc are related taking into account the previous functions giving 3 k c b k c b m a x 1 1 f c ζ η in both vegetation indices the product η ξ 1 and the fit can be approximated to linear with good results 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analysis was conducted with microsoft excel 2013 computer software liengme 2015 a linear regression analysis was performed among fc and kcb and to relate canopy biophysical variables to vis in order to assess the degree of relationship based on the coefficient of determination r2 in addition the standard deviation error assessment of the crop coefficients fig 4 and vegetation indices fig 6 was calculated 3 results 3 1 meteorological conditions table 1 shows the meteorological conditions for each month during the 2008 and 2012 canola growing seasons monthly averages of air temperature ranged between 7 8 23 6 c and wind speed between 2 3 4 5 m s 1 cumulative rainfall resulted 177 mm in 2008 mainly concentrated in may june whereas only 115 mm was registered in 2012 concentrated in march april in this case overall both growing seasons at the itap lysimeter facility albacete were typical of the long term average weather conditions in the southeast of spain although the rainfall during the two seasons was about 22 higher and 20 lower than the 20 year mean in 2008 and 2012 respectively in terms of temperature note may june in 2012 was almost 3 c warmer than the same period in 2008 as a consequence the average evaporative demand was higher in 2012 than in 2008 this difference is concentrated in the months of may and june 3 2 crop development evapotranspiration values and applied irrigation water the maximum fraction of ground cover in this study was reached about 75 and 60 days after planting in 2008 and 2012 respectively late planting in 2012 produced a faster development than in 2008 likely due to canola being sown 27 days later in 2012 than in 2008 under near optimal temperatures in 2008 canola crop height h reached 1 0 m and the maximum canopy cover 0 95 in mid may in 2012 maximum fc 0 97 and h 1 0 m were reached in late may about 10 days later than in 2008 due to the later planting in 2008 the dates of critical growth stages were emergence cotyledons emerge through soil surface on march 17 5 6 leaves unfolded on april 23 and flowering first flowers open on may 19 in 2012 these stages were emergence on april 13 5 6 leaves unfolded on may 11 and flowering on june 3 lancashire et al 1991 in both growing seasons emergence was reached 15 days after planting dap during the initial growth stage the crop reached 5 6 leaves stage during the crop development phase 52 and 43 dap in 2008 and 2012 respectively flowering was reached 78 dap in 2008 and 66 dap in 2012 coinciding with the mid season growth stage dates of sowing and harvest are available in section 2 1 seed yields were around 2400 and 2700 kg ha 1 in 2008 and 2012 growing seasons respectively these are typical yields close to average under sprinkler irrigated conditions in spain the seed yield and the water applied were very similar in the lysimeter surface effective area and at the surrounding field area the crop water productivity for seed yield defined as the ratio between the seed yield and etc trout and dejonge 2017 resulted 0 51 kg m 3 and 0 45 kg m 3 in 2008 and 2012 respectively reference evapotranspiration eto during the canola growing seasons from sowing to harvest was 604 mm in 2008 and 661 mm in 2012 table 2 although 2008 canola growing season was 15 days longer than that of 2012 eto was higher in 2012 primarily due to higher evaporative demand and drier conditions during the mid crop growth season this year in 2008 maximum eto occurred in the late season from mid june to mid july whereas in 2012 maximum eto happened during the mid season stage this also responds to the main rainfall periods for both years mentioned above fig 3 shows the daily canola etc data and the water input from irrigation and rainfall for the 2008 and 2012 seasons etc values increased quickly as the crop development period progressed due to the fast increase of the canopy cover facilitated by the favorable spring temperatures peak etc was reached around mid season coinciding with the maximum fraction of ground cover values and declined during late season stage as green canopy cover dropped seasonal lysimeter based canola etc was 472 and 602 mm in 2008 and 2012 respectively the 28 higher etc value in 2012 was due to a higher evaporative demand during this season mainly during the period of maximum canola water requirements i e mid season when the eto value was a 74 higher in 2012 than in 2008 boosted because this period was about 15 days later in 2012 than in 2008 coinciding with the high temperatures of late spring and early summer thus a larger number of irrigation events larger cumulative seasonal water depth were needed in 2012 than in 2008 the accumulated irrigation supply was 298 mm in 2008 and 538 mm in 2012 resulting in a total irrigation plus rainfall of 472 mm and 602 mm in 2008 and 2012 respectively according to the irrigation management in the lysimeter previously described only the needed amount of water used was restored in the root zone thus no deep percolation drainage was recorded from the lysimeter tank during the experiment 3 3 single and dual crop coefficient curves fig 4 shows the kc data during the two canola growing periods calculated as the ratio of the lysimeter etc measurements and eto calculated with the fao56 pm equation these kc values were adjusted to the fao56 segmented crop coefficient curve average kc obs which consist of four linear segments representative of the four canola growth stages typical kc values for initial kc ini mid season kc mid and end season kc end are shown in table 2 kc values during crop development and late season stages are linearly interpolated with time the maximum average kc values of 1 15 in 2008 and 1 24 in 2012 were reached in the mid season stage the kc mid value was lower in 2008 than in 2012 mainly due to the drier weather conditions in 2012 lower minimum relative humidity in the two study years four distinct growth stages were identified in the seasonal changes in kc in the first stage initial the kc ini values had a higher dispersion due to the effect of soil evaporation after a rainfall and or irrigation event when the ground cover values were low in the second stage crop development the daily kc values increased and maximum values were reached as the plants reached maximum cover which coincided with the initial mid season stage in the third stage mid season the kc mid values were high and more or less constant and in the fourth stage late season as leaves began to age and senescence there was a continuous decrease in daily canola kc until it reached a lower value at the end of the growing period denominated kc end the importance of the soil evaporation component was evaluated by using the dual crop coefficient approach that separates crop transpiration estimated by the basal crop coefficient kcb and soil evaporation evaporation coefficient ke the soil water evaporation becomes significant after a rainfall event or sprinkler irrigation application this is the case particularly during the initial crop growth stage when the fraction of ground surface covered by vegetation is negligible or small and when short wave radiation reaches the soil surface results shown in fig 5 and in table 3 show ke values were greater during initial and beginning of the crop development stages as well as immediately following rainfall or irrigation events when the soil surface turned to wet and a high energy flux reached the surface and was available for the soil water evaporation process the ke values increased during the late season period due to the decreasing values of fc in that period crop senescence as the crop canopy expanded kcb values increased while the ke values decreased the seasonal evaporation component amounted to 113 mm and 112 mm in 2008 and 2012 respectively corresponding to 24 and 19 of etc in 2008 and 2012 respectively crop transpiration was estimated by multiplying eto by kcb resulting values of 359 mm in 2008 and 494 mm in 2012 kcb values during development and late season crop growth periods are linearly interpolated with time fig 5 also shows the kcb values adjusted to the fao56 four

respective values adjusted to standard temperate climate rh min 45 and u2 2 m s 1 std subindex in addition table 4 includes observed ancillary crop parameters for irrigated canola namely maximum root depth zr max maximum crop height h max and maximum fraction of ground cover fc max values of kc end obs and kcb end obs did not require to be adjusted to standard climate conditions as they remained below 0 45 for both years 3 4 relationship between kcb and fc and relate these biophysical variables to vis fig 6 shows the evolution of canola ndvi and savi measured with the asd spectroradiometer during the 2012 canola season both vis curves capture adequately the canola crop growth describing the crop development period from on days after planting dap 30 green up to 52 the mid season from dap 52 to 90 and the late season from dap 90 to 117 fig 7 shows the linear relationship between ndvi and savi with the fraction of ground covered by the canopy fc the savi linear function presents a somewhat better fit less scattering than the ndvi based function because savi minimizes the soil background reflectance noise for the ndvi graphical plot scattering increases for lower to mid values corresponding to a larger soil background exposure fig 8 shows the global linear fit for the complete set including both years in the case of the estimation of kcb based on ndvi and savi fig 8 obtained with the ground based radiometer the savi based kcb function resulted slightly better based on the coefficient of determination and the interception of the linear regression than the ndvi one it is interesting to plot the behavior of the kcb act rs along the development of the crop comparing with the measured kcb values determined from lysimeter measurements and ke values estimated with the fao56 approach fig 10 during the first part of the development the predicted values of kcb act rs are slightly over the real ones after maturation they are slightly below 4 discussion 4 1 canola evapotranspiration and crop coefficients in previous works allen et al 1998 2007 reported canola kc values adjusted to standard climate conditions rhmin 45 and u2 2 m s 1 of kc ini 0 35 kc mid 1 0 1 15 lower value corresponding to rainfed canola with a lower plant population density kc end 0 35 the kc mid and kc end matched our measurements whereas the small differences in the kc ini can be due to the higher evaporation during the initial growth stage in our experiments that most likely occurred due to the rapid canola growth during the early crop growth stage larger soil heat units these authors reported canola kcb values of kcb ini 0 15 kcb mid 0 95 1 10 the lower value for rainfed conditions kcb end 0 25 these kcb values are in agreement with our estimations although our kcb end value is slightly lower 0 20 probably due to the longer duration of senescence in our study beyond fao 56 publication allen et al 1998 studies focused on measuring canola water requirements and deriving new canola crop coefficients are quite scarce in addition some of these studies lack the required information supporting the reported crop coefficients in a lysimeter experiment conducted in north east of bloemfontein south africa dlamini et al 2016 determined the reduction of soil evaporation using plastic and gravel mulches and evaluated the effectiveness of gravel mulch for e t partition under arid climate conditions plastic and gravel mulches reduced e by 36 47 and 33 41 respectively canola transpiration measured with the unmulched lysimeters ranged between 716 and 718 mm whereas e ranged between 42 and 48 mm the higher seasonal canola etc compared to our study was likely due to higher evaporative demand conditions at bloemfontein arid climate however the irrigation system used drip irrigation produced lower e compared with the e values obtained in our study based on a sprinkler irrigation system in a previous research over the same lysimeter facility sánchez et al 2014 compared three methodologies weighing lysimeter simplified two source energy balance stseb model and fao56 and reported discrepancies in the kc values obtained from lysimeter measurements stseb model outputs and those suggested by fao56 however measured kc values were not adjusted to fao four stages curve and kc mid values were not adjusted to a temperate standard climate differences among reports arise also in terms of seasonal canola etc and even among different growing seasons in the same study due to different weather conditions growing season duration or crop varieties and the diversity of canola production systems all over the world furthermore in the few studies available in the literature reporting canola crop coefficients kc mid and kc end values were not adjusted to standard climate conditions making it difficult to transfer them to other regions 4 2 relationships between kcb and fc and vis the relationship between faction of ground cover fc and vegetation indices has been widely studied for many crops that in case of canola the ndvimax 0 93 ndvimin 0 15 and ξ 0 997 and for savi this relationship is savimax 0 75 savimin 0 1 and and ξ 0 994 the value of ξ greater than 1 implies a saturation of the vi near the high values of fc and it agrees with the results obtained in this crop with no appreciable saturation observed fig 7 in this vegetation the maximum crop height is about 1 0 m and the saturation due to the multiple scatter of radiation on nir range inside the different layers in the crop is not enough to show appreciable saturation of the index those results show that the linear relationship approximation is feasible in this crop with good fit this linear relationship is in agreement with other crops like maize and wheat under similar crop architecture with good results applied at satellite level to describe the crop phenology gonzález gómez et al 2018 very similar relationship fc 1 26 ndvi 0 18 was proposed by johnson and trout 2012 for a general model including 18 different crops including row crops orchards grain and vineyards the maximum value of kcb reached during the cycle kcbmax in this case is 1 2 for the ndvi the ndvimax 0 93 the ndvimin 0 15 providing the best fit a value of η 1 05 r2 0 93 in the case of savi the savimax 0 75 savimin 0 10 obtaining for the dumping coefficient η 1 10 this behavior in both indices with the coefficient η close to 1 is in agreement of the approximation of linear fit in canola data observing a saturation in this relationship for values near the maximum of kcb this relationship is controversial but the last works focusing on their validation on applied systems to determine et and its use on advisory irrigation services show consistent results calera et al 2017 calera et al 2017 reviewed linear and polynomial approaches to kcb from ndvi and savi in different row crops maize wheat cotton sugar beet and row vineyard showing slopes in the range of the linear model for canola obtained in our experiment in addition the ndvi function for canola kcb resulted with similar fitting values than those found for cotton pre full cover in arizona usa by hunsaker et al 2003 according to johnson and trout 2012 a more robust approach to characterize kcb using vegetation reflectance or vis is to use the fraction of ground cover fc since ndvi saturates at lai values around 5 m2 m 2 and as was observed in this experiment near the maximum values in savi thus kcb for canola was related to fc fig 9 below depicts the much better linear function obtained with kcb values tight around the fitted curve high coefficient of determination and small slope and intercept therefore using the kcb fc function is recommended over the ones based on ndvi or savi the comparison of basal crop coefficients calculated using vis kcb act rs with the observed ones kcb lysimeter shows a slight overestimation during the initial period fig 10 the different status of the cover between the initial stage and senescence affects the interaction with the radiation and thus the value of the vis considering the same observing and illumination geometry along the crop cycle the reflected radiation of the cover is different in the red band that is mostly absorbed while the nir is partially transmitted to lower layers affecting the value of the vis for the same kcb value due to different crop leaf structure on both periods of the cycle during the crop development stage most of the leaves on the lower layers of the cover are green having photosynthetic activity and this may have an appreciable effect on linearity increasing slightly nir reflectance and the value of the vis 5 conclusions a large weighing lysimeter was used to measure etc and produce crop coefficients for sprinkler irrigated canola in the southeast of spain under semi arid mediterranean weather conditions the results show high water requirements of this crop mainly for the late planting season which could compromise its use in areas with scarcity of water resources single and basal crop coefficient values for mid season were adjusted to standard temperate climate conditions making it possible to transfer them to other areas under different weather conditions the fraction of ground cover fc based kcb function shows that measuring fc is a reliable and likely the most transferrable approach to estimate kcb values of canola estimation and monitoring of spatially distributed water requirements of canola crop at both field and regional scales will benefit from the close relations found among vegetation indices and biophysical parameters relevant for crop management such as kcb and fc in addition the kc act rs methodology applied indicates that it is feasible for the canola crop to estimate kc kcb through the kc act rs kcb act rs method this approach is an enhancement of the fao56 kc approach because captures within season sudden climatic environmental management stress changes and thus assists farmers in identifying potential problems and in developing corrective actions it can be concluded that the outcome of this study provides specific guidelines to estimate canola etc using updated crop coefficients and a remote sensing based procedure to characterize actual crop field conditions which will contribute to a better irrigation scheduling and to optimize water productivity of canola that becomes critical in areas affected by water scarcity declaration of competing interests the authors declare that they have no known

10571,it is widely reported that controlled drainage cd has the potential to reduce outflow and increase crop yield however many researchers demonstrated that the percentage changes in crop yield drainage water quantity and quality to cd use were variable a total of sixty one studies with 1050 data pairs were collected investigating ten main variables yield drainage volume the concentrations and losses of n o 3 n n h 4 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp and then a meta analysis was conducted to 1 estimate the effects of cd on crop yield drainage water quantity and quality 2 identify cropping system paddy rice or dry land crops drainage method surface drainage or subsurface drainage and climate type based on the updated köppen geiger climate classification that benefit yield and drainage water quality under cd results showed that cd increased crop yield by 0 11 decreased drainage volume by 19 23 and reduced the concentrations and losses of all variables mentioned except for n h 4 n concentration and tp concentration dry land crop yield slightly increased while paddy rice yield significantly decreased and the crop yield in the cold d climate increased but that in the temperate c climate decreased the reduction of drainage volume was obvious except for dry land crop in surface drainage n o 3 n concentration decreased to varying degrees and larger responses were found in dry land crop subsurface drainage and arid b or cold d climates cd could greatly alleviate n o 3 n loss except dry land crop in surface drainage different extent increases in n h 4 n concentration were revealed except surface drainage while n h 4 n loss was on average 18 9 lower in cd than in the control tp loss decreased with the exception of surface drainage our findings illustrated the advantages of the cd technique and provided suggestions for the rational application of cd keywords controlled drainage crop yield drainage water quantity drainage water quality meta analysis 1 introduction water is an important natural resource for the survival of all ecosystems but in many cases it is continually degraded and depleted and problems related to water quality are usually caused by nutrients chemicals and pathogens entering aquatic systems as a result of point and non point source activity epa 2009 zia et al 2013 in the 1970s many people started to realize agricultural drainage impacts on water quality and found that practices to improve surface and subsurface agricultural drainage may lead to the increased amount of commonly used fertilizer nutrients derived from subsurface water movement or surface as runoff following rainfall in receiving waters deal et al 1986 ritter 2015 in addition a report by un announced the 17 sustainable development goals sdgs of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development in which goal 2 emphasizes achieving food security and promoting sustainable agriculture un 2015 in view of these it is crucial to develop novel strategies for preserving water resource while still permitting higher production from the perspective of agricultural drainage management one practice that has historically been proposed to control quantity and quality of outflow and guarantee yields is a drainage strategy called controlled drainage cd lalonde et al 1996 wesström et al 2001 ng et al 2002 dukes et al 2003 wessröm and messing 2007 based on agricultural drainage implemented by open ditch systems and underground systems cd is aimed at managing the water level and controlling amount of outflow by applying a structure like a flashboard riser and adjusting the elevation of the drainage outlet evans et al 1995 wesström et al 2001 by holding water in the drain cd reduces the drainage rates and drainage volumes ballantine and tanner 2013 and decreases loads and concentrations of nutrients in drainage ditches cd can be used to prevent water being wasted thus saving irrigation water from another perspective tolomio and borin 2018 cd reduces deep percolation below the root zone by reducing hydraulic gradients decreases drain water salinity because of flow lines closer to the soil surface and increases potential capillary upflow ayars et al 2006 in addition paddy rice requires larger amount of water than other cereal crops and a way known as controlled irrigation and drainage cid has been developed in china combining the advantages of cd and alternate wetting and drying awd cid could achieve a higher water depth and capture more drainage water shao et al 2014 while many studies dealt with the effect of cd on crop yield the results showed disaccords some studies revealed that cd boosted crop yield to different degrees which would benefit both economy and environment tan et al 1997 fisher et al 1999 wessröm and messing 2007 ghane et al 2012 sunohara et al 2014 wesström et al 2014 jouni et al 2018 but on the other hand various studies showed that there was negative effect or no effect or uncertainty on crop yield in response to cd tan et al 1998 cooke and verma 2012 fang et al 2012 poole et al 2013 karegoudar et al 2019 moreover many investigations studied the influences of cd on drainage water quantity in this case drainage volume and quality generally involving the concentrations or losses of n o 3 n n h 4 n tn and tp however similar to the variation between studies about the response of cd related to crop yield the results of the effects of cd on drainage water quantity and quality were also different among relevant researches given these discrepancies how do we rationally conduct cd according to experimental conditions as a quantitative statistical model meta analysis allows for increased objectivity of systematic reviews from separate empirical studies many researchers have used meta analysis to do scientific researches quemada et al 2013 performed a meta analysis to probe the effect of some proven strategies for reducing nitrate leaching du et al 2018 carried out a meta analysis to assess the effects of aerated irrigation on crop yield and water use efficiency wue lu et al 2019 also analyzed the crop yield and wue but only for regulated deficit irrigated processing tomato by means of meta analysis besides gao et al 2020 took advantage of meta analysis and discussed the effects of biochar application on wue considering many factors here a meta analysis was applied to comprehensively analyze the effects of cd on yield drainage water quantity and quality the specific objectives of this study were to a estimate the effects of cd on crop yield drainage water quantity and quality and b and identify cropping system drainage method and climate type that benefit crop yield drainage water quantity and quality under cd systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection a literature search was conducted using the web of science science direct and china national knowledge internet for articles published from april 1960 to december 2019 to characterize the effects of cd on crop yield drainage water quantity and quality the following key words and their variations were used controlled drainage drainage water management water table management yield nitrogen phosphorus and drainage water quality some relevant studies were found by looking up the bibliography of established scientific articles here cd technique mainly refers to that the water table is allowed to potentially rise to a pre selected maximum height there were some studies about controlled drainage and subirrigation and subirrigation was achieved by pumping water through subsurface drainage pipes to maintain the water table just below the root zone to fulfill crop water requirements through capillary rise fausey and baker 2003 as an extension of the controlled drainage concept ballantine and tanner 2013 subirrigation has the same objective as cd maintaining a shallower water table and increasing potential capillary upflow as evapotranspiration depleted soil water in the root zone lalonde et al 1996 and thus we assumed that controlled drainage and subirrigation was the same as cd besides in fact cid is relative to awd as cd is relative to uncontrolled drainage from a water management standpoint hence in the following analysis both generic cd and cid would be referred to as controlled drainage but the control group is different papers were judged on the following criteria and then included 1 the design of the experiment had to be specified in detail including cd timing when in the growing season the cd technique were imposed cd technique equipment and cd technique threshold the water level to which the soil was exposed over a period of time 2 included an experiment and control 3 used replicated samples for each treatment and 4 included measured data rather than simulated data generated by computer modeling all studies required the introduction of experimental sites to determine the type of climate publications with contrast of cd and the control alternative wetting and drying in paddy field or free drainage in dry farmland ck were chosen articles after the final screening were 61 publications in total and data were extracted from tables presented in the manuscripts or from the figures by using origin 2018 google maps was used to show the global distribution of the 61 experimental sites included in the meta analysis database 2 2 building the data sets data on yield were collected from the selected articles that compared the cd with the control group when available data on drainage volume n o 3 n concentration n o 3 n loss n h 4 n concentration n h 4 n loss tn concentration tn loss tp concentration and tp loss under different treatments were also recorded for each observation based on a systematic review furthermore the measurement conditions for these variables in each paper except yield were varied for example data may come from surface runoff or subsurface water at field scale or at field and ditch control scale cover a growing season or longer experiment in paddy field or dry farmland here we collected all of them as response variables but sorted them separately except experiment scale and duration given that many papers were not specific about these descriptions apart from collecting the interesting response variables yield drainage water volume and related variables of drainage water quality some moderating variables if they were reported were also collected from the identified articles such as soil texture soil ph and bulk density in our study soil texture groups include loamy soil group and non loamy soil sandy and clayey soil group which were preferentially based on usda soil texture classes usda 1993 and then on the content of the literature moreover cropping system paddy rice or dry land crops and drainage method surface drainage or subsurface drainage were also collected in general for surface drainage and subsurface drainage drainage water was routed to a center instrumentation building and volumes were recorded using water flow meters in the cd and ck conditions and sometimes for subsurface drainage drainage water from cd was collected in a control structure device restricting drain flow and then conducted to a measuring well and drainage water from ck was collected directly into a measuring well wesström et al 2001 in practice since it was difficult to distinguish surface drainage from subsurface drainage in some cases evans et al 1995 the main basis for determining which subgroup the data belonged to was the report content of the paper where the loss of indicators related to surface and subsurface drainage were called the runoff losses and the leaching losses respectively in addition we adopted the kӧppen geiger climate classification and determined the climate type of each site concerned with the selected papers by google earth files of updated kӧppen geiger climate map of the world supported by murray peel based on the long term observed data this updated version has a high degree of objectivity including 3 tropical af am and aw 4 arid bwh bwk bsh and bsk 9 temperate csa csb csc cfa cfb cfc cwa cwb and cwc 12 cold dsa dsb dsc dsd dfa dfb dfc dfd dwa dwb dwc and dwd and 2 polar et and ef peel et al 2007 the description of every climate type can be referred to peel et al 2007 here we collected specific climate types and then analyzed it in terms of five categories tropical a arid b temperate c cold d and polar e additionally it should be noted that groups with fewer than three studies were excluded from each analysis 2 3 data analysis data were analyzed using the package meta of r software to study the effects of cd on crop yield and the other variables that had been identified a random effect model was used in this meta analysis for the outcome of variables yield drainage volume and related variables of drainage water quality the response ratio r was considered as the measure of effect size and it was calculated as below hedges et al 1999 1 r x t x c where xt and xc were the mean value of each variable under cd and ck in a single data pair respectively the calculation of variance of effect size involves standard deviations sd if standard errors se rather than sd were provided sd was calculated by s d s e n n the number of total replicates jian et al 2016 if neither sd nor se was provided we would try to contact the corresponding authors for the data however if these were not worked variances were interpolated as the coefficient of variance of all experimental means from that paper multiplied by the treatment mean and each variance was then doubled to reduce the weighting of studies containing interpolated data in the final analysis jeffery et al 2017 then calculations with meta analysis followed the procedure given by hedges et al 1999 in data processing the natural logarithm of the r and its variance were calculated for each variable of interest and then converted back to response ratios quemada et al 2013 for the sake of explanation all results were reported as r 1 100 expressing the percentage change directly and presented by forest plots gao et al 2020 each point and the bars in the plots represent the mean response ratio and 95 cis separately and numbers in parenthesis on the right of the cis show the number of control treatment pairs right and the total number of replicates left for each analysis in the forest plot the 95 ci without overlap zero stood that the effect of cd was significantly different from ck and the 95 ci between categories showing non overlapping indicated significantly different from each other hedges et al 1999 3 results 3 1 overview of the dataset sixty one studies met our screening criteria representing a global data set fig 2 the geographical distribution was as follow north america 43 asia 43 europe 13 and africa 1 all rice field data came from asia 100 and most came from china 95 a large proportion of dry land crop field data came from north america 67 the dataset showed that cd had a statistically significant negative effect on drainage volume n o 3 n concentration n o 3 n loss n h 4 n loss tn loss and tp loss and a statistically significant positive effect on n h 4 n concentration but no significant difference was found on other aspects overall the cd increased yield n h 4 n concentration and tp concentration by 0 11 35 20 and 1 55 95 ci 0 49 0 70 14 17 56 23 3 71 6 80 on average respectively but decreased drainage volume by 19 23 ci 23 32 15 13 n o 3 n concentration by 19 07 ci 23 83 14 30 n o 3 n loss by 36 11 ci 41 31 30 90 n h 4 n loss by 18 90 ci 31 90 5 89 tn concentration by 0 59 ci 4 47 3 29 tn loss by 31 80 ci 45 43 18 16 and tp loss by 18 79 ci 34 51 3 07 compared to control treatment fig 1 heterogeneity existed between the paired data in each variable and due to the enough pairs gathered we conducted subgroup analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the cd application in view of lack of detailed description about soil texture of the most selected literatures we couldn t categorize it by a uniform standard and considering that the effects of soil ph and bulk density were of little relevance for our data set we focused on the mean effect size of the cropping system the drainage method and the climate type to cd table 1 3 2 effect of cd on yield fig 3 shows yield responses to cd application grouped by cropping system paddy rice or dry land crops and the kӧppen geiger climate classification considering that the amount of data required for subgroup analysis was at least three studies we divided the available data into two climate types for further discussion there was a statistically significant difference in yield responses between paddy rice and dry land crop but no statistically significant difference was found between the temperate c and cold d climates no significant increase in yield occurred in dry land crop and the cold d climate and the other groupings both showed a significant negative effect on yield but to a lesser extent 3 3 effect of cd on drainage volume significantly different effects on drainage volume for all of the subgroups were detected fig 4 for the classification of cropping system and the kӧppen geiger climate cd application could significantly decrease drainage volume compared to the control and two groups within each classification had overlapping ci meaning that the relative effect was similar with respect to drainage method there existed a significant increase on drainage volume in controlled surface drainage relative to uncontrolled surface drainage and a decrease in controlled subsurface drainage relative to uncontrolled subsurface drainage as for combining cropping system with drainage method all categories showed statistically significant decreases in drainage volume with the exception of the dry land crop surface drainage however dry land crop surface drainage even showed a positive effect on drainage volume 30 815 on average 95 ci 17 56 44 07 3 4 effect of cd on drainage water quality 3 4 1 effect of cd on n o 3 n concentration and n o 3 n loss fig 5 shows the responses of n o 3 n concentration to cd application in relation to cropping system drainage method and the kӧppen geiger climate classification cd application decreased n o 3 n concentration by 1 63 and 20 53 respectively for paddy rice and dry land crop while the effect was only statistically significant on dry land crop in addition cd did not have a significant effect on n o 3 n concentration in surface drainage and the ci of the surface drainage ranged from 21 to 0 08 with 15 observations out of 43 showing an increase in cd but by contrast n o 3 n concentration in subsurface drainage decreased by 21 9 with statistical significance clearly with regard to the kӧppen geiger climate classification the decreases of n o 3 n concentration in all situations except the temperate c climate were statistically significant but no statistically significant differences were observed between the temperate c and arid b or cold d the direction and magnitude of n o 3 n loss responses to cd were dependent on the effect size of cd on n o 3 n concentration and drainage volume so the cd effect on n o 3 n loss may be different from that on n o 3 n concentration these results show fig 6 in largely confirmed potential of cd to reduce n o 3 n loss through the classification of cropping system drainage method and the kӧppen geiger climate type n o 3 n losses were significantly reduced except for surface drainage and dry land crop surface drainage for these two special cases their effects on n o 3 n loss in response to cd application were overall small not more than 20 and made no statistically difference in addition relatively few observations concerned with the effect of controlled drainage on n o 3 n loss of paddy rice but all observations indicated cd had a beneficial effect on n o 3 n loss 3 4 2 effect of cd on n h 4 n concentration and n h 4 n loss different extent increases in n h 4 n concentration were found in any of the group except for surface drainage 0 22 on average 95 ci 8 85 8 41 fig 7 there were statistically significant differences between groupings within each classification but no significantly different effects on n h 4 n concentration for paddy rice and temperate c were detected the relationship between n h 4 n loss and n h 4 n concentration is similar to that between n o 3 n loss and n o 3 n concentration on account of a few studies reporting the effect of cd on n h 4 n loss we processed available data into two groups there were decreases on n h 4 n loss in both surface drainage and subsurface drainage while the subsurface drainage in response to cd increased n h 4 n loss in 9 out of 21 observations fig 8 the decrease of n h 4 n loss in surface drainage was statistically significant different and the opposite was true for subsurface drainage which decreased n h 4 n loss by an average of 12 76 95 ci 33 26 7 75 however no difference was evident between n h 4 n loss in subsurface drainage and that in surface drainage 3 4 3 effect of cd on tn concentration and tn loss the data set about tn concentration and tn loss reported in collected articles produced some pairs 16 and 21 respectively and considering the specifics of the data these pairs were not enough to be classified into subgroups fig 1 overall applying cd presented similar regulations on tn concentration and tn loss the mean effect sizes in tn concentration and tn loss were 0 59 and 31 80 respectively and the difference was an insignificant decrease in tn concentration and a significant decrease in tn loss compared to ck 3 4 4 effect of cd on tp concentration and tp loss there were small increases in tp concentration through three classifications the cropping system the drainage method and the kӧppen geiger climate classification but all increases were not significant fig 9 differences between any two groups in responses of tp concentration to cd were not significant within any classification there was a trend whereby cd led to decrease on tp loss fig 10 for the classification of cropping system and kӧppen geiger climate all of subgroups indicated beneficial effects on tp loss but not statistically significant for the drainage method it showed no significant increase of tp loss in surface drainage in response to cd and a significant decrease of tp loss in subsurface drainage 4 discussion overall controlled drainage was effective for controlling drainage water quality without sacrificing crop yield although the cd increased n h 4 n concentration and tp concentration in outflow fig 1 4 1 cd influencing yield drainage is important to crop growth this study illustrated that generally cd had a positive effect on crop yield although not significant fig 3 when the available data were divided into two subgroups in relation to the cropping system the effects of cd on crop yield were quite different between dry land crop and paddy rice as shown in fig 3a for dry land crop there was no significant increase in yield compared to control groups 0 57 on average 95 ci 0 11 1 25 this finding was similar to the conclusion that yields under cd increased by 2 18 found by wesström and messing 2007 the reason why dry land crop yield improved under cd was that cd would probably increase plant n uptake in view of the water retained in cd sunohara et al 2014 ng et al 2002 also considered cd could help promote more efficient uptake of plant nutrients and water by raising the water table however opposite to the dry land crop the application of cd significantly decreased rice yield 1 56 on average 95 ci 2 38 to 0 73 the result was in agreement with previous study karegoudar et al 2019 which reported paddy grain yield was slightly lower for cd compared to conventional drainage conditions the possible reason was that the maximum water level of cd set in some selected articles may be too high relative to reality this reason had been explored in previous study gao et al 2018b which suggested there was no negative impact on the plant water status during the drying period if ponding water depth after rainstorms was controlled properly in paddy fields besides appropriate cd would improve root growth in favor of accumulating dry matter and then affect grain yield but rice growth was remarkably influenced by the drought and flooding duration which were associated with many environmental variables gao et al 2018a the response of crop yield to cd not only depends on the cropping system but also on the weather conditions the experiment data had been classified into two categories according to the kӧppen geiger climate classification as shown in fig 3b from the figure we could see the difference between the temperate c and cold d climates and more specifically the temperate c significantly decreased crop yield while the yield increased but not significant in the cold d the sets of the temperate c and cold d are based on temperature criteria only which involves the temperature of the hottest and coldest month peel et al 2007 the different effects on yield may be related to the data contained in this meta analysis for a deeper study we classified the climate type in our database in more detail into four types i e cfa cwa dfa and dfb with the amount of paired data of 89 10 40 and 116 respectively data not shown it was shown that the mean effect sizes of cfa and cwa climate types were negative but that of dfa and dfb climate types were not indicating that cfa and cwa climate types may have a slight adverse effect on crop yield under cd however little researches studied the effect of cd on crop yield according to the kӧppen geiger climate classification maybe later studies could further discuss this aspect 4 2 cd influencing drainage volume as is well known cd could reduce volumes of drainage water by means of retaining excess water in the soil for some days bonaiti and borin 2010 this opinion was consistent with the results as shown in fig 4 with the exception of the cd application in surface drainage fig 4b or rather cd application for dry land crop in surface drainage fig 4c which increased drainage volume in general the reductions in total drain outflow could partly be explained by increased soil water storage due to a raised groundwater level and partly by climatic factors e g soil frost and evaporation wesström et al 2001 more specifically a period of soil frost would temporarily increase the soil water storage volume however the unexpected phenomenon may be related to the data included in this meta analysis the similar finding was found by tan and zhang 2011 with the observation that controlled drainage and subirrigation produced greater surface runoff and less tile drainage volume relative to the free drainage but the more decreased tile drainage water could compensate for the increased surface runoff some studies indicated that the subirrigation water used increased the antecedent soil moisture content which would result in the reduction of the natural precipitation absorbed by soil and the increase of surface runoff borin et al 2001 drury et al 2009 tan and zhang 2011 drury et al 2009 further pointed out the much shallower effective tile depths under cd would make a great difference to the drainage volume compared to the unrestricted drainage however the appropriate water table can increase the interaction between roots and water table and may help decrease surface water accumulation and overland flow potential sunohara et al 2014 in addition it is still possible for the drainage system to trap the lateral flow reducing the total flow only slightly ayars et al 2006 for the results of climate classification analysis both the temperate c and cold d climates in response to cd had negative effects on drainage volume meaning that cd reduced the amount of water displaced compared with the control group considering that the low temperature would reduce evapotranspiration water uptake played a little role leading to the loss of most of the rainfall by drainage borin et al 2001 this may be occurred in temperate c climate in the uncontrolled drainage but cd allowed excess water retained in the soil by the implementation of simple devices for the cold d climate there may be freezing of water in the control structures under cd condition due to the lowest temperature below zero degrees celsius this possibly conduced to preclude drainage and reduce overland flow in winter spring bracmort et al 2006 and the freezing conditions in winter may constrain the monitoring of the various fluxes but free drainage did not 4 3 cd influencing drainage water quality controlled drainage is considered to be the best management practice to reduce the transport and delivery of nitrogen and phosphorus to the receiving water bodies however the effectiveness of cd on drainage water quality was varied by type of drainage system rainfall and so on evans et al 1995 generally speaking samples of drainage water were analyzed for some variables involved in water quality assessment and both the concentration of every variable and the drain outflow determined the loss of each variable in other words the sampling time may introduce a bias for the following analysis of concentration and loss of every variable in view of typical runoff hydrographs in surface and subsurface outflow rates evans et al 1995 4 3 1 n o 3 n concentration and n o 3 n loss through the classification of cropping system drainage method and the kӧppen geiger climate fig 5 the n o 3 n concentration was declined in each subgroup to some content which meant that cd was an effective strategy to control n o 3 n concentration factually it was mainly due to increases in rice rhizosphere soil nitrate reductase nar activity and nitrite reductase nir activity in an anaerobic environment chen et al 2014 for paddy rice cd decreased n o 3 n concentration but not significantly fig 5a the potential cause to explain the finding was that drainage limits were set differently from experiment to experiment influencing denitrification and nitrification by means of creating different aerobic conditions by the dewatering progresses peng et al 2015 for dry land crop cd significantly decreased n o 3 n concentration with a reduction of 20 53 relative to free drainage fig 5a a larger n o 3 n concentration reduction in cd was observed by lalonde et al 1996 and the mechanism that cd increased plant uptake of nitrogen and affected leaching mineralization and other processes could be used to explain it the general patterns of n o 3 n concentration in response to cd in surface runoff and subsurface drainage were similar i e both of the drainage methods showed negative effects on n o 3 n concentration fig 5b however there was a larger reduction on n o 3 n concentration in subsurface drainage compared with subsurface drainage the surface water responses to cd on the average nitrogen concentration among studies we selected were various to a greater extent which mainly influenced by the annual rainfall variation yu et al 2018 this may also illustrate why a larger confidence interval was found for surface drainage and another reason to explain the larger effect on subsurface drainage may be that peak outflow rates on predominately subsurface drainage systems tend to be about half as high as on surface systems evans et al 1995 and difference also existed in outflow rate between subsurface and surface drainage systems even though the sampling time was not the peak therefore the sampling time indirectly affected the determination of n o 3 n concentration the analysis results also showed the effect on n o 3 n concentration under cd in the temperate c climate was significantly different from the cd effect in the arid b or cold d climates through the classification of kӧppen geiger climate fig 5c there is a little negative response 0 46 on average in n o 3 n concentration in the temperate c climate compared to the other categories and the larger decreases were shown in the arid b and cold d climates 25 59 and 20 26 on average respectively in other words cd may be conducive to the decrease of n o 3 n concentration in the arid b and cold d climates from this study wesström et al 2001 found that in spring the topsoil moisture content was high and the soil temperature increased which significantly reduced the nitrate concentration in the drain outflow indicating that the nitrate concentration was obviously affected by the water content and temperature in the topsoil to explore further the paired data from the temperate c climate were subdivided into cfa and cwa climates data not shown the cfa climate represents locations without dry season and with a hot summer and the cwa climate represents the sites with a dry winter and a hot summer by computation we found that cfa increased n o 3 n concentration by 3 but cwa decreased it by 6 while both of them were not significant considering cfa climate without dry season it is likely that the annual rainfall is relative evenly distributed and thus cd may improve nitrification besides with respect to cwa climate it may include a hot and wetter summer and the decrease in n o 3 n concentration could be explained that the dry winter lead to so little outflow that could not be sampled and the humid summer would make the effect of cd on n o 3 n concentration a little obvious compared to the control but all of these need to be proved in future significant decreases in n o 3 n loss with exception of the case that surface drainage or rather cd application for dry land crop in surface drainage meant that cd was an effective strategy to control n o 3 n loss which represented potential fertilizer savings and pollution prevention fig 6 given that the loss of nitrate nitrogen in the effluent from the drain depends on the combination of leaching available nitrogen and excess precipitation wessröm and messing 2007 in other words n o 3 n loss responses to cd depends on both n o 3 n concentration and drainage volume the results of our analysis are easy to understand lalonde et al 1996 demonstrated cd significantly reduced nitrate in drainage water owing to reduced drainage flow and lower concentrations besides it is obvious that if the change directions of n o 3 n concentration and drainage volume are different their magnitudes may affect the final effect size of n o 3 n loss in addition zhao et al 2012 found that in the rice season nitrogen loss was caused by frequent drainage so cd would be important for controlling nitrogen loss especially for paddy soil 4 3 2 n h 4 n concentration and n h 4 n loss through the classification of cropping system drainage method and the kӧppen geiger climate except surface drainage category it was shown that compared treatments had similar patterns but different values the larger average positive percentage changes in n h 4 n concentration in response to cd were seen fig 7 one possible reason for higher n h 4 n concentration in cd compared with the control group was that the higher water levels in cd may periodically reduce the nitrification wesström et al 2014 specifically wesström et al 2007 found that occasionally there were rises in n h 4 n concentrations followed by rises in n o 3 n concentrations and concluded that cd may occasionally affect mineralization and nitrification rates especially during wet conditions for paddy rice the long term flooding and high groundwater table may lead to nitrification limited and denitrification intensive which caused the increase of n h 4 n concentration tan et al 2013 in fact it was mainly due to increases in rice rhizosphere soil nitrate reductase nar activity nitrite reductase nir activity and hydroxylamine reductase hyr activity in an anaerobic environment chen et al 2014 besides gao et al 2018b observed the n h 4 n concentration would increase after fertilization in percolation water and attributed it to high percolation and soil cracks which would accelerate the transportation of n h 4 n for the similar fact zhao et al 2012 assumed that after quick hydrolysis of applied urea with oxygen limited nitrification under flooding conditions n h 4 n could still flow downward with infiltrated water moreover cd led to highly contrasting effects in different drainage methods fig 7b and the reason may be that the n h 4 n concentration in surface water was mainly influenced by the annual rainfall variation yu et al 2018 as a result the decrease of n h 4 n concentration in surface drainage can be related to the data included in this meta analysis much like the relation between n o 3 n loss and n o 3 n concentration n h 4 n loss responses to cd depends on both n h 4 n concentration and drainage volume in current study for surface drainage cd increased drainage volume by 14 64 and decreased n h 4 n concentration by 0 22 while cd decreased n h 4 n loss by 20 19 on the whole for subsurface drainage cd decreased drainage volume by 27 56 and increased n h 4 n concentration by 61 29 while from an overall perspective cd decreased n h 4 n loss by 12 76 the reason why there was no significant decrease in subsurface drainage 3 2 on average 95 ci 1 4 8 0 fig 8 was that we included some adverse data in this meta analysis we took the grey literature reporting cd increased n h 4 n loss into consideration and collected 9 paired data from three of them according to the study of mcauley et al 2000 4 3 3 tn concentration and tn loss no subgroup was further divided in tn concentration and loss responses in present study due to the limitations of the amount of observations in comparison to the control cd decreased tn concentration and tn loss by 0 59 and 31 80 respectively fig 1 the significant decrease in discharge load of tn coincided with great reductions in both drainage volume and tn concentration the result was consistent with previous research peng et al 2009 in which the possible reasons for this phenomenon were revealed as follows that cd prolonged the residence time of paddy field drainage in ditch and increased the time of nitrogen in drainage water contacting with drainage ditch sediment and aquatic plants ingrid wesström et al 2014 observed cd reduced tn loss around 60 compared to the control and suggested that the high tn loss in the control group may be attributed to the large difference between applied n and n uptake i e the control leaved more n in soil while cd had large positive effects on n uptake in crop by raising the water table controlled drainage and subirrigation could help promote more efficient absorption of plant nutrient and water ng et al 2002 in view of the facts that few studies have explored tn concentration and loss and the loss of tn is not only associated with tn concentration but also related to drainage volume more efforts should be made to elicit a better understanding of the contribution of cd in improving tn in drainage water in different situations through more classifications 4 3 4 tp concentration and tp loss phosphorus p is an essential nutrient for crop and animal production but similar to the other elements such as nitrogen sometimes it may accelerate freshwater eutrophication a form of water quality damage sharpley et al 2001 the effects of cd on the average change in tp concentration were very consistent with an increase of less than 12 but not significant fig 9 it was proved by many studies and some researchers demonstrated this fact could be attributed to the hypoxic environment created by cd specifically due to insufficient soil oxygen supply eh value decreased and ph value increased and trivalent fe of phosphoric acid metal compound was reduced to divalent soluble fe ion leading to releasing more soluble phosphorus and significantly increasing tp concentration sharpley et al 2001 wesström and messing 2007 yu et al 2018 however this finding was completely contrary to the conclusion found by qiao et al 2011 with the observation that the tp concentration in cd was lower than that in the control the reason may be that compared with the uncontrolled drainage ditch the water depth in the controlled drainage ditch was deeper reducing the hydraulic gradient of runoff drainage velocity and the phosphorus carrying capacity qiao et al 2011 the difference of soil drying degree may be the main reason for the difference of phosphorus concentration in the leakage solution but the specific influencing mechanism needs to be combined with the analysis of the change of phosphorus concentration in different soil layers which needs to be further studied yu et al 2018 additionally we found tp concentration responses presented the similar regulations through three classifications the cropping system the drainage method and the kӧppen geiger climate classification the reason may be that the data included in this meta analysis were bundled and reused in different categories which may affect the accuracy of our conclusions in practice given that the p leaching is a major factor for water eutrophication the average tp concentration in drainage water merits attention and when it exceeds the threshold values of eutrophication effective measures should be taken to inhibit it like the consistent results in tp concentration the effects of cd on tp loss were also accordant apart from the surface drainage category fig 10 in which cd showed a small increase on tp loss 2 66 on average 95 ci 31 61 36 93 what s more the loss of tp corresponded to the tp concentration and drainage volume this may illustrate all of the results including the negligible increase in surface drainage under cd such a large confidence interval in tp loss in surface drainage may be caused by different response of different crop types to the cd treatment and different growing environment for crops wessröm et al 2001 found the phosphorus losses were 58 and 85 less for cd relative to the uncontrolled drainage values in two years that was different from the study of yu et al 2018 and the data in that study showed that approximately 50 60 reduction in tp average runoff loss and about 15 25 rise in tp average leaching loss occurred when carrying out cd this discrepancy was due to a difference in drainage water volume during the measurement periods the higher p loads may be associated with the stored water in cd jensen 2000 indicated that ponding could enhance the transport of preferential flow and also prolong the load by extending the contact between stagnant water and p source haggard et al 2005 also demonstrated that sediment p flux was fourfold greater under anaerobic conditions compared with aerobic conditions considering that cd would occasionally bring about ponding and anaerobic conditions the increase in surface drainage was not difficult to understand from a different perspective 4 4 limitations of the current study various studies have detected the crop yield drainage water quantity and quality in field or plot under cd in consideration of lack detailed description about soil texture of the most selected literatures and the inconsistence of the criteria for classifying soil types we couldn t conduct a more detailed analysis to explore the effect of soil texture on these variables involved in this paper in other words even if the subgroup analysis was performed according to the experimental soil texture mentioned in the paper care should be taken when we explained the results considering the unequal distribution of soil texture comparisons most of the pairwise comparisons were in loam however outflows vary widely depending on soil factors so researchers should attempt to define soils using internationally accepted standards or just provide a more detailed description of the soil cd is remarkably affected by environmental variables including climatic factor to be specific the cd practice causes dramatic changes in soil physical environment influencing microbial processes tan et al 2013 shao et al 2014 these microbial processes may be related to soil temperature and soil moisture status which would come down to the local weather conditions in spite of the kӧppen geiger climate classification adopted in this study few studies have explored the effect of cd by taking the climate into account so that limitations exist in the conclusions about climate impacts drawn in this paper consequently further investigations are needed on the application of cd system from a climate standpoint and the designs of future research should be combined with underlying mechanisms proposed in this paper for a more reliable evaluation of the cd with regard to drainage water quantity and quality different experimental scale and duration at field scale or at field and ditch control scale cover a growing season or longer might lead to the gap between our results and the ideal situation in addition different studies used different methods to measure the drainage water quantity and quality which may affect the determination nevertheless since the effect size was calculated as the response ratio for each pair of observations the difference associated with the experimental scale and duration and the measurement method tended to compensate hedges et al 1999 moreover although cd clearly has advantages above uncontrolled drainage practice from the results of this study more research is needed on the long term effects of controlled drainage especially for some arid and semiarid regions of the world in which cd is likely to be beneficial wahba et al 2001 5 conclusions by reviewing available scientific literature before december 2019 this study has highlighted the potential of cd for reducing drainage water quantity and improving drainage water quality while maintaining crop yield overall the use of cd increased crop yield by 0 11 and decreased drainage volume by 19 23 in terms of the drainage water quality cd had beneficial effects on the concentrations and losses of all variables related except for n h 4 n concentration and tp concentration however it is essential to stress that this doesn t mean that cd applications will get similar results in any case the results of this study showed that cd had a small impact on crop yield indicating that cd did not come at the cost of crop yield dry land crop yield slightly increased while rice yield significantly decreased and the crop yield in the cold d climate increased but that in the temperate c climate decreased the reduction of drainage volume was obvious under cd within any subgroup except for dry land crop in surface drainage the concentration of n o 3 n decreased to varying degrees it significantly decreased in dry land crop while not in rice decreased more in subsurface drainage than that in surface drainage and decreased less in the temperate c climate than that in the cold d and arid b climates likewise the implement of cd could greatly alleviate n o 3 n loss but for dry land crop in surface drainage the cropping system drainage method and the kӧppen geiger climate affected the n h 4 n concentration when the data collected were grouped according to our standard and all of the grand means of n h 4 n concentration were positive except for surface drainage 0 22 on average 95 ci 8 85 8 41 although the mean effect sizes varied to a great extent in each category the application of cd offered some potential with reduction of n h 4 n loss which was on average 18 9 lower in cd than in the control in spite of only drainage method subgroup analysis performed because of limited observations at the same time cd provided some benefits in reducing tn concentration and loss and further analysis could be achieved if sufficient data were collected moreover tp concentration were increased by less than 12 but not significantly in all subgroups which may incur a negative impact on our environment the implementation of cd would mitigate tp loss in outflow which may contribute to a cost saving for the farmer except for surface drainage showing a 2 66 increase in tp loss our results demonstrated that cd appeared to be a promising win win practice with the beneficial environmental effect and a concurrent slight increase in crop yield but more efforts are needed to explore the relevant factors affecting drainage water quality to balance the economy society and environment declaration of competing interest no conflict of interest exits in

10571,it is widely reported that controlled drainage cd has the potential to reduce outflow and increase crop yield however many researchers demonstrated that the percentage changes in crop yield drainage water quantity and quality to cd use were variable a total of sixty one studies with 1050 data pairs were collected investigating ten main variables yield drainage volume the concentrations and losses of n o 3 n n h 4 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp and then a meta analysis was conducted to 1 estimate the effects of cd on crop yield drainage water quantity and quality 2 identify cropping system paddy rice or dry land crops drainage method surface drainage or subsurface drainage and climate type based on the updated köppen geiger climate classification that benefit yield and drainage water quality under cd results showed that cd increased crop yield by 0 11 decreased drainage volume by 19 23 and reduced the concentrations and losses of all variables mentioned except for n h 4 n concentration and tp concentration dry land crop yield slightly increased while paddy rice yield significantly decreased and the crop yield in the cold d climate increased but that in the temperate c climate decreased the reduction of drainage volume was obvious except for dry land crop in surface drainage n o 3 n concentration decreased to varying degrees and larger responses were found in dry land crop subsurface drainage and arid b or cold d climates cd could greatly alleviate n o 3 n loss except dry land crop in surface drainage different extent increases in n h 4 n concentration were revealed except surface drainage while n h 4 n loss was on average 18 9 lower in cd than in the control tp loss decreased with the exception of surface drainage our findings illustrated the advantages of the cd technique and provided suggestions for the rational application of cd keywords controlled drainage crop yield drainage water quantity drainage water quality meta analysis 1 introduction water is an important natural resource for the survival of all ecosystems but in many cases it is continually degraded and depleted and problems related to water quality are usually caused by nutrients chemicals and pathogens entering aquatic systems as a result of point and non point source activity epa 2009 zia et al 2013 in the 1970s many people started to realize agricultural drainage impacts on water quality and found that practices to improve surface and subsurface agricultural drainage may lead to the increased amount of commonly used fertilizer nutrients derived from subsurface water movement or surface as runoff following rainfall in receiving waters deal et al 1986 ritter 2015 in addition a report by un announced the 17 sustainable development goals sdgs of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development in which goal 2 emphasizes achieving food security and promoting sustainable agriculture un 2015 in view of these it is crucial to develop novel strategies for preserving water resource while still permitting higher production from the perspective of agricultural drainage management one practice that has historically been proposed to control quantity and quality of outflow and guarantee yields is a drainage strategy called controlled drainage cd lalonde et al 1996 wesström et al 2001 ng et al 2002 dukes et al 2003 wessröm and messing 2007 based on agricultural drainage implemented by open ditch systems and underground systems cd is aimed at managing the water level and controlling amount of outflow by applying a structure like a flashboard riser and adjusting the elevation of the drainage outlet evans et al 1995 wesström et al 2001 by holding water in the drain cd reduces the drainage rates and drainage volumes ballantine and tanner 2013 and decreases loads and concentrations of nutrients in drainage ditches cd can be used to prevent water being wasted thus saving irrigation water from another perspective tolomio and borin 2018 cd reduces deep percolation below the root zone by reducing hydraulic gradients decreases drain water salinity because of flow lines closer to the soil surface and increases potential capillary upflow ayars et al 2006 in addition paddy rice requires larger amount of water than other cereal crops and a way known as controlled irrigation and drainage cid has been developed in china combining the advantages of cd and alternate wetting and drying awd cid could achieve a higher water depth and capture more drainage water shao et al 2014 while many studies dealt with the effect of cd on crop yield the results showed disaccords some studies revealed that cd boosted crop yield to different degrees which would benefit both economy and environment tan et al 1997 fisher et al 1999 wessröm and messing 2007 ghane et al 2012 sunohara et al 2014 wesström et al 2014 jouni et al 2018 but on the other hand various studies showed that there was negative effect or no effect or uncertainty on crop yield in response to cd tan et al 1998 cooke and verma 2012 fang et al 2012 poole et al 2013 karegoudar et al 2019 moreover many investigations studied the influences of cd on drainage water quantity in this case drainage volume and quality generally involving the concentrations or losses of n o 3 n n h 4 n tn and tp however similar to the variation between studies about the response of cd related to crop yield the results of the effects of cd on drainage water quantity and quality were also different among relevant researches given these discrepancies how do we rationally conduct cd according to experimental conditions as a quantitative statistical model meta analysis allows for increased objectivity of systematic reviews from separate empirical studies many researchers have used meta analysis to do scientific researches quemada et al 2013 performed a meta analysis to probe the effect of some proven strategies for reducing nitrate leaching du et al 2018 carried out a meta analysis to assess the effects of aerated irrigation on crop yield and water use efficiency wue lu et al 2019 also analyzed the crop yield and wue but only for regulated deficit irrigated processing tomato by means of meta analysis besides gao et al 2020 took advantage of meta analysis and discussed the effects of biochar application on wue considering many factors here a meta analysis was applied to comprehensively analyze the effects of cd on yield drainage water quantity and quality the specific objectives of this study were to a estimate the effects of cd on crop yield drainage water quantity and quality and b and identify cropping system drainage method and climate type that benefit crop yield drainage water quantity and quality under cd systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection a literature search was conducted using the web of science science direct and china national knowledge internet for articles published from april 1960 to december 2019 to characterize the effects of cd on crop yield drainage water quantity and quality the following key words and their variations were used controlled drainage drainage water management water table management yield nitrogen phosphorus and drainage water quality some relevant studies were found by looking up the bibliography of established scientific articles here cd technique mainly refers to that the water table is allowed to potentially rise to a pre selected maximum height there were some studies about controlled drainage and subirrigation and subirrigation was achieved by pumping water through subsurface drainage pipes to maintain the water table just below the root zone to fulfill crop water requirements through capillary rise fausey and baker 2003 as an extension of the controlled drainage concept ballantine and tanner 2013 subirrigation has the same objective as cd maintaining a shallower water table and increasing potential capillary upflow as evapotranspiration depleted soil water in the root zone lalonde et al 1996 and thus we assumed that controlled drainage and subirrigation was the same as cd besides in fact cid is relative to awd as cd is relative to uncontrolled drainage from a water management standpoint hence in the following analysis both generic cd and cid would be referred to as controlled drainage but the control group is different papers were judged on the following criteria and then included 1 the design of the experiment had to be specified in detail including cd timing when in the growing season the cd technique were imposed cd technique equipment and cd technique threshold the water level to which the soil was exposed over a period of time 2 included an experiment and control 3 used replicated samples for each treatment and 4 included measured data rather than simulated data generated by computer modeling all studies required the introduction of experimental sites to determine the type of climate publications with contrast of cd and the control alternative wetting and drying in paddy field or free drainage in dry farmland ck were chosen articles after the final screening were 61 publications in total and data were extracted from tables presented in the manuscripts or from the figures by using origin 2018 google maps was used to show the global distribution of the 61 experimental sites included in the meta analysis database 2 2 building the data sets data on yield were collected from the selected articles that compared the cd with the control group when available data on drainage volume n o 3 n concentration n o 3 n loss n h 4 n concentration n h 4 n loss tn concentration tn loss tp concentration and tp loss under different treatments were also recorded for each observation based on a systematic review furthermore the measurement conditions for these variables in each paper except yield were varied for example data may come from surface runoff or subsurface water at field scale or at field and ditch control scale cover a growing season or longer experiment in paddy field or dry farmland here we collected all of them as response variables but sorted them separately except experiment scale and duration given that many papers were not specific about these descriptions apart from collecting the interesting response variables yield drainage water volume and related variables of drainage water quality some moderating variables if they were reported were also collected from the identified articles such as soil texture soil ph and bulk density in our study soil texture groups include loamy soil group and non loamy soil sandy and clayey soil group which were preferentially based on usda soil texture classes usda 1993 and then on the content of the literature moreover cropping system paddy rice or dry land crops and drainage method surface drainage or subsurface drainage were also collected in general for surface drainage and subsurface drainage drainage water was routed to a center instrumentation building and volumes were recorded using water flow meters in the cd and ck conditions and sometimes for subsurface drainage drainage water from cd was collected in a control structure device restricting drain flow and then conducted to a measuring well and drainage water from ck was collected directly into a measuring well wesström et al 2001 in practice since it was difficult to distinguish surface drainage from subsurface drainage in some cases evans et al 1995 the main basis for determining which subgroup the data belonged to was the report content of the paper where the loss of indicators related to surface and subsurface drainage were called the runoff losses and the leaching losses respectively in addition we adopted the kӧppen geiger climate classification and determined the climate type of each site concerned with the selected papers by google earth files of updated kӧppen geiger climate map of the world supported by murray peel based on the long term observed data this updated version has a high degree of objectivity including 3 tropical af am and aw 4 arid bwh bwk bsh and bsk 9 temperate csa csb csc cfa cfb cfc cwa cwb and cwc 12 cold dsa dsb dsc dsd dfa dfb dfc dfd dwa dwb dwc and dwd and 2 polar et and ef peel et al 2007 the description of every climate type can be referred to peel et al 2007 here we collected specific climate types and then analyzed it in terms of five categories tropical a arid b temperate c cold d and polar e additionally it should be noted that groups with fewer than three studies were excluded from each analysis 2 3 data analysis data were analyzed using the package meta of r software to study the effects of cd on crop yield and the other variables that had been identified a random effect model was used in this meta analysis for the outcome of variables yield drainage volume and related variables of drainage water quality the response ratio r was considered as the measure of effect size and it was calculated as below hedges et al 1999 1 r x t x c where xt and xc were the mean value of each variable under cd and ck in a single data pair respectively the calculation of variance of effect size involves standard deviations sd if standard errors se rather than sd were provided sd was calculated by s d s e n n the number of total replicates jian et al 2016 if neither sd nor se was provided we would try to contact the corresponding authors for the data however if these were not worked variances were interpolated as the coefficient of variance of all experimental means from that paper multiplied by the treatment mean and each variance was then doubled to reduce the weighting of studies containing interpolated data in the final analysis jeffery et al 2017 then calculations with meta analysis followed the procedure given by hedges et al 1999 in data processing the natural logarithm of the r and its variance were calculated for each variable of interest and then converted back to response ratios quemada et al 2013 for the sake of explanation all results were reported as r 1 100 expressing the percentage change directly and presented by forest plots gao et al 2020 each point and the bars in the plots represent the mean response ratio and 95 cis separately and numbers in parenthesis on the right of the cis show the number of control treatment pairs right and the total number of replicates left for each analysis in the forest plot the 95 ci without overlap zero stood that the effect of cd was significantly different from ck and the 95 ci between categories showing non overlapping indicated significantly different from each other hedges et al 1999 3 results 3 1 overview of the dataset sixty one studies met our screening criteria representing a global data set fig 2 the geographical distribution was as follow north america 43 asia 43 europe 13 and africa 1 all rice field data came from asia 100 and most came from china 95 a large proportion of dry land crop field data came from north america 67 the dataset showed that cd had a statistically significant negative effect on drainage volume n o 3 n concentration n o 3 n loss n h 4 n loss tn loss and tp loss and a statistically significant positive effect on n h 4 n concentration but no significant difference was found on other aspects overall the cd increased yield n h 4 n concentration and tp concentration by

heterogeneity existed between the paired data in each variable and due to the enough pairs gathered we conducted subgroup analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the cd application in view of lack of detailed description about soil texture of the most selected literatures we couldn t categorize it by a uniform standard and considering that the effects of soil ph and bulk density were of little relevance for our data set we focused on the mean effect size of the cropping system the drainage method and the climate type to cd table 1 3 2 effect of cd on yield fig 3 shows yield responses to cd application grouped by cropping system paddy rice or dry land crops and the kӧppen geiger climate classification considering that the amount of data required for subgroup analysis was at least three studies we divided the available data into two climate types for further discussion there was a statistically significant difference in yield responses between paddy rice and dry land crop but no statistically significant difference was found between the temperate c and cold d climates no significant increase in yield occurred in dry land crop and the cold d climate and the other groupings both showed a significant negative effect on yield but to a lesser extent 3 3 effect of cd on drainage volume significantly different effects on drainage volume for all of the subgroups were detected fig 4 for the classification of cropping system and the kӧppen geiger climate cd application could significantly decrease drainage volume compared to the control and two groups within each classification had overlapping ci meaning that the relative effect was similar with respect to drainage method there existed a significant increase on drainage volume in controlled surface drainage relative to uncontrolled surface drainage and a decrease in controlled subsurface drainage relative to uncontrolled subsurface drainage as for combining cropping system with drainage method all categories showed statistically significant decreases in drainage volume with the exception of the dry land crop surface drainage however dry land crop surface drainage even showed a positive effect on drainage volume 30 815 on average 95 ci 17 56 44 07 3 4 effect of cd on drainage water quality 3 4 1 effect of cd on n o 3 n concentration and n o 3 n loss fig 5 shows the responses of n o 3 n concentration to cd application in relation to cropping system drainage method and the kӧppen geiger climate classification cd application decreased n o 3 n concentration by 1 63 and 20 53 respectively for paddy rice and dry land crop while the effect was only statistically significant on dry land crop in addition cd did not have a significant effect on n o 3 n concentration in surface drainage and the ci of the surface drainage ranged from 21 to 0 08 with 15 observations out of 43 showing an increase in cd but by contrast n o 3 n concentration in subsurface drainage decreased by 21 9 with statistical significance clearly with regard to the kӧppen geiger climate classification the decreases of n o 3 n concentration in all situations except the temperate c climate were statistically significant but no statistically significant differences were observed between the temperate c and arid b or cold d the direction and magnitude of n o 3 n loss responses to cd were dependent on the effect size of cd on n o 3 n concentration and drainage volume so the cd effect on n o 3 n loss may be different from that on n o 3 n concentration these results show fig 6 in largely confirmed potential of cd to reduce n o 3 n loss through the classification of cropping system drainage method and the kӧppen geiger climate type n o 3 n losses were significantly reduced except for surface drainage and dry land crop surface drainage for these two special cases their effects on n o 3 n loss in response to cd application were overall small not more than 20 and made no statistically difference in addition relatively few observations concerned with the effect of controlled drainage on n o 3 n loss of paddy rice but all observations indicated cd had a beneficial effect on n o 3 n loss 3 4 2 effect of cd on n h 4 n concentration and n h 4 n loss different extent increases in n h 4 n concentration were found in any of the group except for surface drainage 0 22 on average 95 ci 8 85 8 41 fig 7 there were statistically significant differences between groupings within each classification but no significantly different effects on n h 4 n concentration for paddy rice and temperate c were detected the relationship between n h 4 n loss and n h 4 n concentration is similar to that between n o 3 n loss and n o 3 n concentration on account of a few studies reporting the effect of cd on n h 4 n loss we processed available data into two groups there were decreases on n h 4 n loss in both surface drainage and subsurface drainage while the subsurface drainage in response to cd increased n h 4 n loss in 9 out of 21 observations fig 8 the decrease of n h 4 n loss in surface drainage was statistically significant different and the opposite was true for subsurface drainage which decreased n h 4 n loss by an average of 12 76 95 ci 33 26 7 75 however no difference was evident between n h 4 n loss in subsurface drainage and that in surface drainage 3 4 3 effect of cd on tn concentration and tn loss the data set about tn concentration and tn loss reported in collected articles produced some pairs 16 and 21 respectively and considering the specifics of the data these pairs were not enough to be classified into subgroups fig 1 overall applying cd presented similar regulations on tn concentration and tn loss the mean effect sizes in tn concentration and tn loss were 0 59 and 31 80 respectively and the difference was an insignificant decrease in tn concentration and a significant decrease in tn loss compared to ck 3 4 4 effect of cd on tp concentration and tp loss there were small increases in tp concentration through three classifications the cropping system the drainage method and the kӧppen geiger climate classification but all increases were not significant fig 9 differences between any two groups in responses of tp concentration to cd were not significant within any classification there was a trend whereby cd led to decrease on tp loss fig 10 for the classification of cropping system and kӧppen geiger climate all of subgroups indicated beneficial effects on tp loss but not statistically significant for the drainage method it showed no significant increase of tp loss in surface drainage in response to cd and a significant decrease of tp loss in subsurface drainage 4 discussion overall controlled drainage was effective for controlling drainage water quality without sacrificing crop yield although the cd increased n h 4 n concentration and tp concentration in outflow fig 1 4 1 cd influencing yield drainage is important to crop growth this study illustrated that generally cd had a positive effect on crop yield although not significant fig 3 when the available data were divided into two subgroups in relation to the cropping system the effects of cd on crop yield were quite different between dry land crop and paddy rice as shown in fig 3a for dry land crop there was no significant increase in yield compared to control groups 0 57 on average 95 ci 0 11 1 25 this finding was similar to the conclusion that yields under cd increased by 2 18 found by wesström and messing 2007 the reason why dry land crop yield improved under cd was that cd would probably increase plant n uptake in view of the water retained in cd sunohara et al 2014 ng et al 2002 also considered cd could help promote more efficient uptake of plant nutrients and water by raising the water table however opposite to the dry land crop the application of cd significantly decreased rice yield 1 56 on average 95 ci 2 38 to 0 73 the result was in agreement with previous study karegoudar et al 2019 which reported paddy grain yield was slightly lower for cd compared to conventional drainage conditions the possible reason was that the maximum water level of cd set in some selected articles may be too high relative to reality this reason had been explored in previous study gao et al 2018b which suggested there was no negative impact on the plant water status during the drying period if ponding water depth after rainstorms was controlled properly in paddy fields besides appropriate cd would improve root growth in favor of accumulating dry matter and then affect grain yield but rice growth was remarkably influenced by the drought and flooding duration which were associated with many environmental variables gao et al 2018a the response of crop yield to cd not only depends on the cropping system but also on the weather conditions the experiment data had been classified into two categories according to the kӧppen geiger climate classification as shown in fig 3b from the figure we could see the difference between the temperate c and cold d climates and more specifically the temperate c significantly decreased crop yield while the yield increased but not significant in the cold d the sets of the temperate c and cold d are based on temperature criteria only which involves the temperature of the hottest and coldest month peel et al 2007 the different effects on yield may be related to the data contained in this meta analysis for a deeper study we classified the climate type in our database in more detail into four types i e cfa cwa dfa and dfb with the amount of paired data of 89 10 40 and 116 respectively data not shown it was shown that the mean effect sizes of cfa and cwa climate types were negative but that of dfa and dfb climate types were not indicating that cfa and cwa climate types may have a slight adverse effect on crop yield under cd however little researches studied the effect of cd on crop yield according to the kӧppen geiger climate classification maybe later studies could further discuss this aspect 4 2 cd influencing drainage volume as is well known cd could reduce volumes of drainage water by means of retaining excess water in the soil for some days bonaiti and borin 2010 this opinion was consistent with the results as shown in fig 4 with the exception of the cd application in surface drainage fig 4b or rather cd application for dry land crop in surface drainage fig 4c which increased drainage volume in general the reductions in total drain outflow could partly be explained by increased soil water storage due to a raised groundwater level and partly by climatic factors e g soil frost and evaporation wesström et al 2001 more specifically a period of soil frost would temporarily increase the soil water storage volume however the unexpected phenomenon may be related to the data included in this meta analysis the similar finding was found by tan and zhang 2011 with the observation that controlled drainage and subirrigation produced greater surface runoff and less tile drainage volume relative to the free drainage but the more decreased tile drainage water could compensate for the increased surface runoff some studies indicated that the subirrigation water used increased the antecedent soil moisture content which would result in the reduction of the natural precipitation absorbed by soil and the increase of surface runoff borin et al 2001 drury et al 2009 tan and zhang 2011 drury et al 2009 further pointed out the much shallower effective tile depths under cd would make a great difference to the drainage volume compared to the unrestricted drainage however the appropriate water table can increase the interaction between roots and water table and may help decrease surface water accumulation and overland flow potential sunohara et al 2014 in addition it is still possible for the drainage system to trap the lateral flow reducing the total flow only slightly ayars et al 2006 for the results of climate classification analysis both the temperate c and cold d climates in response to cd had negative effects on drainage volume meaning that cd reduced the amount of water displaced compared with the control group considering that the low temperature would reduce evapotranspiration water uptake played a little role leading to the loss of most of the rainfall by drainage borin et al 2001 this may be occurred in temperate c climate in the uncontrolled drainage but cd allowed excess water retained in the soil by the implementation of simple devices for the cold d climate there may be freezing of water in the control structures under cd condition due to the lowest temperature below zero degrees celsius this possibly conduced to preclude drainage and reduce overland flow in winter spring bracmort et al 2006 and the freezing conditions in winter may constrain the monitoring of the various fluxes but free drainage did not 4 3 cd influencing drainage water quality controlled drainage is considered to be the best management practice to reduce the transport and delivery of nitrogen and phosphorus to the receiving water bodies however the effectiveness of cd on drainage water quality was varied by type of drainage system rainfall and so on evans et al 1995 generally speaking samples of drainage water were analyzed for some variables involved in water quality assessment and both the concentration of every variable and the drain outflow determined the loss of each variable in other words the sampling time may introduce a bias for the following analysis of concentration and loss of every variable in view of typical runoff hydrographs in surface and subsurface outflow rates evans et al 1995 4 3 1 n o 3 n concentration and n o 3 n loss through the classification of cropping system drainage method and the kӧppen geiger climate fig 5 the n o 3 n concentration was declined in each subgroup to some content which meant that cd was an effective strategy to control n o 3 n concentration factually it was mainly due to increases in rice rhizosphere soil nitrate reductase nar activity and nitrite reductase nir activity in an anaerobic environment chen et al 2014 for paddy rice cd decreased n o 3 n concentration but not significantly fig 5a the potential cause to explain the finding was that drainage limits were set differently from experiment to experiment influencing denitrification and nitrification by means of creating different aerobic conditions by the dewatering progresses peng et al 2015 for dry land crop cd significantly decreased n o 3 n concentration with a reduction of 20 53 relative to free drainage fig 5a a larger n o 3 n concentration reduction in cd was observed by lalonde et al 1996 and the mechanism that cd increased plant uptake of nitrogen and affected leaching mineralization and other processes could be used to explain it the general patterns of n o 3 n concentration in response to cd in surface runoff and subsurface drainage were similar i e both of the drainage methods showed negative effects on n o 3 n concentration fig 5b however there was a larger reduction on n o 3 n concentration in subsurface drainage compared with subsurface drainage the surface water responses to cd on the average nitrogen concentration among studies we selected were various to a greater extent which mainly influenced by the annual rainfall variation yu et al 2018 this may also illustrate why a larger confidence interval was found for surface drainage and another reason to explain the larger effect on subsurface drainage may be that peak outflow rates on predominately subsurface drainage systems tend to be about half as high as on surface systems evans et al 1995 and difference also existed in outflow rate between subsurface and surface drainage systems even though the sampling time was not the peak therefore the sampling time indirectly affected the determination of n o 3 n concentration the analysis results also showed the effect on n o 3 n concentration under cd in the temperate c climate was significantly different from the cd effect in the arid b or cold d climates through the classification of kӧppen geiger climate fig 5c there is a little negative response 0 46 on average in n o 3 n concentration in the temperate c climate compared to the other categories and the larger decreases were shown in the arid b and cold d climates 25 59 and 20 26 on average respectively in other words cd may be conducive to the decrease of n o 3 n concentration in the arid b and cold d climates from this study wesström et al 2001 found that in spring the topsoil moisture content was high and the soil temperature increased which significantly reduced the nitrate concentration in the drain outflow indicating that the nitrate concentration was obviously affected by the water content and temperature in the topsoil to explore further the paired data from the temperate c climate were subdivided into cfa and cwa climates data not shown the cfa climate represents locations without dry season and with a hot summer and the cwa climate represents the sites with a dry winter and a hot summer by computation we found that cfa increased n o 3 n concentration by 3 but cwa decreased it by 6 while both of them were not significant considering cfa climate without dry season it is likely that the annual rainfall is relative evenly distributed and thus cd may improve nitrification besides with respect to cwa climate it may include a hot and wetter summer and the decrease in n o 3 n concentration could be explained that the dry winter lead to so little outflow that could not be sampled and the humid summer would make the effect of cd on n o 3 n concentration a little obvious compared to the control but all of these need to be proved in future significant decreases in n o 3 n loss with exception of the case that surface drainage or rather cd application for dry land crop in surface drainage meant that cd was an effective strategy to control n o 3 n loss which represented potential fertilizer savings and pollution prevention fig 6 given that the loss of nitrate nitrogen in the effluent from the drain depends on the combination of leaching available nitrogen and excess precipitation wessröm and messing 2007 in other words n o 3 n loss responses to cd depends on both n o 3 n concentration and drainage volume the results of our analysis are easy to understand lalonde et al 1996 demonstrated cd significantly reduced nitrate in drainage water owing to reduced drainage flow and lower concentrations besides it is obvious that if the change directions of n o 3 n concentration and drainage volume are different their magnitudes may affect the final effect size of n o 3 n loss in addition zhao et al 2012 found that in the rice season nitrogen loss was caused by frequent drainage so cd would be important for controlling nitrogen loss especially for paddy soil 4 3 2 n h 4 n concentration and n h 4 n loss through the classification of cropping system drainage method and the kӧppen geiger climate except surface drainage category it was shown that compared treatments had similar patterns but different values the larger average positive percentage changes in n h 4 n concentration in response to cd were seen fig 7 one possible reason for higher n h 4 n concentration in cd compared with the control group was that the higher water levels in cd may periodically reduce the nitrification wesström et al 2014 specifically wesström et al 2007 found that occasionally there were rises in n h 4 n concentrations followed by rises in n o 3 n concentrations and concluded that cd may occasionally affect mineralization and nitrification rates especially during wet conditions for paddy rice the long term flooding and high groundwater table may lead to nitrification limited and denitrification intensive which caused the increase of n h 4 n concentration tan et al 2013 in fact it was mainly due to increases in rice rhizosphere soil nitrate reductase nar activity nitrite reductase nir activity and hydroxylamine reductase hyr activity in an anaerobic environment chen et al 2014 besides gao et al 2018b observed the n h 4 n concentration would increase after fertilization in percolation water and attributed it to high percolation and soil cracks which would accelerate the transportation of n h 4 n for the similar fact zhao et al 2012 assumed that after quick hydrolysis of applied urea with oxygen limited nitrification under flooding conditions n h 4 n could still flow downward with infiltrated water moreover cd led to highly contrasting effects in different drainage methods fig 7b and the reason may be that the n h 4 n concentration in surface water was mainly influenced by the annual rainfall variation yu et al 2018 as a result the decrease of n h 4 n concentration in surface drainage can be related to the data included in this meta analysis much like the relation between n o 3 n loss and n o 3 n concentration n h 4 n loss responses to cd depends on both n h 4 n concentration and drainage volume in current study for surface drainage cd increased drainage volume by 14 64 and decreased n h 4 n concentration by 0 22 while cd decreased n h 4 n loss by 20 19 on the whole for subsurface drainage cd decreased drainage volume by 27 56 and increased n h 4 n concentration by 61 29 while from an overall perspective cd decreased n h 4 n loss by 12 76 the reason why there was no significant decrease in subsurface drainage 3 2 on average 95 ci 1 4 8 0 fig 8 was that we included some adverse data in this meta analysis we took the grey literature reporting cd increased n h 4 n loss into consideration and collected 9 paired data from three of them according to the study of mcauley et al 2000 4 3 3 tn concentration and tn loss no subgroup was further divided in tn concentration and loss responses in present study due to the limitations of the amount of observations in comparison to the control cd decreased tn concentration and tn loss by 0 59 and 31 80 respectively fig 1 the significant decrease in discharge load of tn coincided with great reductions in both drainage volume and tn concentration the result was consistent with previous research peng et al 2009 in which the possible reasons for this phenomenon were revealed as follows that cd prolonged the residence time of paddy field drainage in ditch and increased the time of nitrogen in drainage water contacting with drainage ditch sediment and aquatic plants ingrid wesström et al 2014 observed cd reduced tn loss around 60 compared to the control and suggested that the high tn loss in the control group may be attributed to the large difference between applied n and n uptake i e the control leaved more n in soil while cd had large positive effects on n uptake in crop by raising the water table controlled drainage and subirrigation could help promote more efficient absorption of plant nutrient and water ng et al 2002 in view of the facts that few studies have explored tn concentration and loss and the loss of tn is not only associated with tn concentration but also related to drainage volume more efforts should be made to elicit a better understanding of the contribution of cd in improving tn in drainage water in different situations through more classifications 4 3 4 tp concentration and tp loss phosphorus p is an essential nutrient for crop and animal production but similar to the other elements such as nitrogen sometimes it may accelerate freshwater eutrophication a form of water quality damage sharpley et al 2001 the effects of cd on the average change in tp concentration were very consistent with an increase of less than 12 but not significant fig 9 it was proved by many studies and some researchers demonstrated this fact could be attributed to the hypoxic environment created by cd specifically due to insufficient soil oxygen supply eh value decreased and ph value increased and trivalent fe of phosphoric acid metal compound was reduced to divalent soluble fe ion leading to releasing more soluble phosphorus and significantly increasing tp concentration sharpley et al 2001 wesström and messing 2007 yu et al 2018 however this finding was completely contrary to the conclusion found by qiao et al 2011 with the observation that the tp concentration in cd was lower than that in the control the reason may be that compared with the uncontrolled drainage ditch the water depth in the controlled drainage ditch was deeper reducing the hydraulic gradient of runoff drainage velocity and the phosphorus carrying capacity qiao et al 2011 the difference of soil drying degree may be the main reason for the difference of phosphorus concentration in the leakage solution but the specific influencing mechanism needs to be combined with the analysis of the change of phosphorus concentration in different soil layers which needs to be further studied yu et al 2018 additionally we found tp concentration responses presented the similar regulations through three classifications the cropping system the drainage method and the kӧppen geiger climate classification the reason may be that the data included in this meta analysis were bundled and reused in different categories which may affect the accuracy of our conclusions in practice given that the p leaching is a major factor for water eutrophication the average tp concentration in drainage water merits attention and when it exceeds the threshold values of eutrophication effective measures should be taken to inhibit it like the consistent results in tp concentration the effects of cd on tp loss were also accordant apart from the surface drainage category fig 10 in which cd showed a small increase on tp loss 2 66 on average 95 ci 31 61 36 93 what s more the loss of tp corresponded to the tp concentration and drainage volume this may illustrate all of the results including the negligible increase in surface drainage under cd such a large confidence interval in tp loss in surface drainage may be caused by different response of different crop types to the cd treatment and different growing environment for crops wessröm et al 2001 found the phosphorus losses were 58 and 85 less for cd relative to the uncontrolled drainage values in two years that was different from the study of yu et al 2018 and the data in that study showed that approximately 50 60 reduction in tp average runoff loss and about 15 25 rise in tp average leaching loss occurred when carrying out cd this discrepancy was due to a difference in drainage water volume during the measurement periods the higher p loads may be associated with the stored water in cd jensen 2000 indicated that ponding could enhance the transport of preferential flow and also prolong the load by extending the contact between stagnant water and p source haggard et al 2005 also demonstrated that sediment p flux was fourfold greater under anaerobic conditions compared with aerobic conditions considering that cd would occasionally bring about ponding and anaerobic conditions the increase in surface drainage was not difficult to understand from a different perspective 4 4 limitations of the current study various studies have detected the crop yield drainage water quantity and quality in field or plot under cd in consideration of lack detailed description about soil texture of the most selected literatures and the inconsistence of the criteria for classifying soil types we couldn t conduct a more detailed analysis to explore the effect of soil texture on these variables involved in this paper in other words even if the subgroup analysis was performed according to the experimental soil texture mentioned in the paper care should be taken when we explained the results considering the unequal distribution of soil texture comparisons most of the pairwise comparisons were in loam however outflows vary widely depending on soil factors so researchers should attempt to define soils using internationally accepted standards or just provide a more detailed description of the soil cd is remarkably affected by environmental variables including climatic factor to be specific the cd practice causes dramatic changes in soil physical environment influencing microbial processes tan et al 2013 shao et al 2014 these microbial processes may be related to soil temperature and soil moisture status which would come down to the local weather conditions in spite of the kӧppen geiger climate classification adopted in this study few studies have explored the effect of cd by taking the climate into account so that limitations exist in the conclusions about climate impacts drawn in this paper consequently further investigations are needed on the application of cd system from a climate standpoint and the designs of future research should be combined with underlying mechanisms proposed in this paper for a more reliable evaluation of the cd with regard to drainage water quantity and quality different experimental scale and duration at field scale or at field and ditch control scale cover a growing season or longer might lead to the gap between our results and the ideal situation in addition different studies used different methods to measure the drainage water quantity and quality which may affect the determination nevertheless since the effect size was calculated as the response ratio for each pair of observations the difference associated with the experimental scale and duration and the measurement method tended to compensate hedges et al 1999 moreover although cd clearly has advantages above uncontrolled drainage practice from the results of this study more research is needed on the long term effects of controlled drainage especially for some arid and semiarid regions of the world in which cd is likely to be beneficial wahba et al 2001 5 conclusions by reviewing available scientific literature before december 2019 this study has highlighted the potential of cd for reducing drainage water quantity and improving drainage water quality while maintaining crop yield overall the use of cd increased crop yield by 0 11 and decreased drainage volume by 19 23 in terms of the drainage water quality cd had beneficial effects on the concentrations and losses of all variables related except for n h 4 n concentration and tp concentration however it is essential to stress that this doesn t mean that cd applications will get similar results in any case the results of this study showed that cd had a small impact on crop yield indicating that cd did not come at the cost of crop yield dry land crop yield slightly increased while rice yield significantly decreased and the crop yield in the cold d climate increased but that in the temperate c climate decreased the reduction of drainage volume was obvious under cd within any subgroup except for dry land crop in surface drainage the concentration of n o 3 n decreased to varying degrees it significantly decreased in dry land crop while not in rice decreased more in subsurface drainage than that in surface drainage and decreased less in the temperate c climate than that in the cold d and arid b climates likewise the implement of cd could greatly alleviate n o 3 n loss but for dry land crop in surface drainage the cropping system drainage method and the kӧppen geiger climate affected the n h 4 n concentration when the data collected were grouped according to our standard and all of the grand means of n h 4 n concentration were positive except for surface drainage 0 22 on average 95 ci 8 85 8 41 although the mean effect sizes varied to a great extent in each category the application of cd offered some potential with reduction of n h 4 n loss which was on average 18 9 lower in cd than in the control in spite of only drainage method subgroup analysis performed because of limited observations at the same time cd provided some benefits in reducing tn concentration and loss and further analysis could be achieved if sufficient data were collected moreover tp concentration were increased by less than 12 but not significantly in all subgroups which may incur a negative impact on our environment the implementation of cd would mitigate tp loss in outflow which may contribute to a cost saving for the farmer except for surface drainage showing a 2 66 increase in tp loss our results demonstrated that cd appeared to be a promising win win practice with the beneficial environmental effect and a concurrent slight increase in crop yield but more efforts are needed to explore the relevant factors affecting drainage water quality to balance the economy society and environment declaration of competing interest no conflict of interest exits in

10572,regulating water use in agriculture in water stressed basins is a challenging task recent scholarship emphasises the need to combine strong state oversight for achieving the collective extraction caps with considerable leeway to users to allocate water according to local priorities this form of co management between the state and users aims to improve the implementation of sustainable extraction limits this model was adopted in france where agricultural user groups share water resources within a capped allocation pool enforced by the state this paper evaluates whether the allocation rules developed by user groups improve environmental economic and social performance a detailed survey was carried out amongst the 54 agricultural user groups created across france results suggest that the reform has led to greater awareness amongst irrigators of their water resources and the slow emergence of collective action allocation rules have been developed reflecting local economic and social priorities as well as the temporal and spatial dynamics of local surface and groundwater resources although challenges remain the research presented in this paper supports co management to manage agricultural water extraction and discusses institutional design features that can facilitate its implementation keywords water scarcity drought common property management collective action regulation 1 introduction recent decades have seen a significant increase in water extraction one main driver being agricultural irrigation by adopting irrigation farmers have boosted yields and reduced the risk of crop failure in dry years contributing to reduce poverty and fuelling growth in many rural areas around the world however as river basins and aquifers become more intensively exploited and climate change intensifies and lengthens drought events water demand can outstrip water availability groundwater mining is a major threat in many arid countries famiglietti 2014 in temperate regions intensive seasonal extraction in rivers and shallow aquifers exacerbates summer low flows in rivers leading to higher pollution concentration and the drying up of permanent streams de graaf et al 2019 to avoid resource exhaustion and protect aquatic ecosystems authorities around the world are adopting stricter controls on water extraction in particular from irrigated agriculture eea 2009 oecd 2015 gruère et al 2018 one common policy response has been to define sustainable extraction limits sel or caps that ensure water extraction is set at levels that protect access to the resource for future generations and avoid environmental impacts individual allocations are then defined entitling each user to a share of the sel in the form of an extraction quota such cap and allocate systems are usually run by public authorities with the idea that the state can protect the general interest maximise welfare and ensure accountable decisions due to public scrutiny however experience has shown that the acceptability of state run allocation regimes can be low amongst local communities and users bruns et al 2005 in addition the lack of human and financial capacities of public authorities to monitor compliance over thousands of extraction points often means that rules are poorly enforced which further hinder their legitimacy and effectiveness molle and closas 2020b instead of public authorities water users can be given the responsibility of setting caps and allocating water in a form of self governance scholars have observed that users organised in water user associations can establish long enduring institutions supporting complex allocation decisions e g ostrom 1990 allocation decisions made by users are deemed more acceptable because they are empirically grounded and locally negotiated resulting in a close fit with local resource conditions histories and needs however scholars highlight that users may lack commitment where the perceived benefits of imposing restrictions exceed the perceived costs for example when sels focus on reserving enough water to protect aquatic biodiversity at the expense of farmers income esteban and albiac 2012 hence most reported cases of user based allocations refer to user groups created to share water supplied by a common infrastructure e g collective irrigation schemes see e g tang 1992 or to share water from a resource facing exhaustion see e g blomquist 1992 in that context a growing literature is exploring more closely how state and users can best share powers and responsibilities to improve the performance of sels and allocation systems schlager and lopez gunn 2006 cases include spain lópez gunn and cortina 2006 closas et al 2017 mexico wester et al 2011 australia skurray 2015 shalsi et al 2019 the us hoffman and zellmer 2013 kiparsky et al 2017 and new zealand boone and fragaszy 2018 in their recent review of groundwater co management molle and closas 2020a argue that the state should allow maximum autonomy to user groups while providing for a clear shadow of hierarchy or credible threat if users do not act collectively without state intervention this paper reports the experience of france which since 2006 has progressively moved away from a state centred approach in order to devolve allocation decisions over irrigation water to agricultural water user groups after more than 10 years of implementation 54 user groups have been created throughout france this paper presents the first in depth and systematic analysis based on intensive fieldwork of these newly established user groups and the allocation rules they have established the evaluation of these institutional arrangements will be of interest for other scholars authorities and stakeholders working on the self regulation of agricultural water extraction this paper is organised as follows section 2 first provides an overview of the french regulatory regime on water extraction in particular its approach to devolution the methodology and the material collected are then presented section 3 section 4 describes the results of a national survey on the governance arrangements and allocation rules designed by these user groups finally the paper reflects on the diversity of observed institutions and draws conclusions on the capacity of hybrid state user allocation systems to develop fair efficient and environmentally effective sharing rules section 5 2 the regulation of irrigation water extraction in france irrigated agriculture started to expand significantly in france following a major drought that struck french agriculture at the end of the 1970s irrigated agriculture now covers about 2 million ha across france it accounts for 50 of net water use and up to 80 during the dry season the peak demand coinciding with seasonal river low flows in the late 1980s as conflicts between users were increasing the french authorities started to regulate water extraction by setting river minimum flow and aquifer level thresholds below which temporary restrictions on water use in the form of a time ban on irrigation imposed at specific hours and days of the week were implemented these thresholds were set to ensure the survival of fish populations and more generally the sustainability of aquatic ecosystems because this first regulation was ineffective see rinaudo 2020 the french authorities developed a new approach based on volumetric management this approach relied on three pillars systematic metering of all water extraction the definition of sels at catchment or aquifer level and the allocation of individual user caps iucs the expected advantage of this new approach was to reduce uncertainty each user receiving a reduced but guaranteed allocated volume for the whole irrigation season this approach tested in a few catchments in the 1990s was made compulsory for all priority catchments and aquifers across france under the 2006 water law the current french water allocation regime essentially operates within a nested system of targets and rules at river basin district level river basin committees comprising of representatives of the state regional and local governments users and environmental ngos co design river basin management plans in which they set environmental flow targets at key nodes of the river basin in line with the requirements of the eu water framework directive wfd at catchment or aquifer level a nested local plan is developed by local water commissions setting environmental flow targets and aquifer threshold levels at a finer scale in priority basins this local plan also defines sels that guarantee that environmental objectives will be met four years out of five sels are specified in volumetric units for each management area and for each season usually divided into wet and dry season management areas must be hydrologically coherent units corresponding to sub catchment parts of a sub catchment or different aquifers connected or not connected to surface water once sels for each management area are set the local water commission divides the available water between economic sectors all agricultural irrigators must join a user group called the single collective management organisation organisme unique de gestion collective hereafter ougc which is entrusted with the responsibility of managing the bulk volume allocated to agriculture this ougc receives a permit corresponding to the bulk allocation and the state cancels all permits which were previously granted to individual users the ougc must then define rules on how the bulk allocation will be shared amongst their members a number of studies undertaken to define sels concluded that agricultural extraction should be reduced by 10 20 in most catchments and by over 50 in some cases arnaud 2020 one of the key choices made by the legislator was to give considerable leeway to ougcs to establish locally adapted governance and allocation rules the law neither specifies the scale at which ougcs must be formed nor the type of legal entity which can act as ougc it does not impose any specific internal governance structure nor does it prescribe how to share water amongst ougc members and how to reach sels the few legal constraint are i the ougc must both represents irrigators and supports the state in implementing an effective control on extraction ii all irrigators should be treated equally and fairly and iii rules must be transparent to members of the ougc and outlined in an internal rulebook finally the state must validate the choice of legal entity managing the ougc and the yearly allocation plan it also retains responsibility for imposing sanctions on users not following their ougc s decisions the ougc may nevertheless provide for complementary sanctions ougcs were progressively established between 2010 and 2018 as part of a very decentralized policy driven by state administration operating at county level départements although previous studies have highlighted the potential for a diversity of rules established by ougc loubier and polge 2016 rinaudo and hérivaux 2016 no systematic analysis of the internal governance of ougcs and the rules they developed has been carried out up to now this paper fills this gap 3 material and method a survey of collective irrigation water management association our methodology consisted of three steps fig 1 in the first step an internet search and interviews of national water management experts led to the identification of 54 ougcs across france fig 2 official documents related to the establishment of ougcs were collected in particular administrative authorisation specifying the legal entity managing the ougc bulk allocation permits measures required to reduce the environmental impact of extraction internal rulebooks presenting the governance of the ougc allocation rules financing arrangements monitoring and compliance other documents such as hydrological studies conducted to set the sels application forms submitted by the ougc to obtain the bulk allocation permit annual allocation plans irrigation campaign reports a full list of ougc is provided in the supplementary material in the results section specific cases presented in the supplementary material will be referred to using the sign in the second step 25 ougcs were selected for further investigation they were selected paying attention to the diversity of institutional design choices and their spatial distribution across france interviews were held with managers of these 25 ougcs to better understand the reasons underpinning the choice of the legal entity put in charge of the ougc their spatial boundaries allocation rules and enforcement arrangements in addition 11 national and regional experts with broad views of ougc development were interviewed they were selected to cover the main national and regional stakeholders including state authorities responsible for regulating water extraction water agencies implementing the wfd national representatives of the agricultural sector and environmental ngos and researchers in the third step three case studies representing 12 ougcs in total were selected to examine the views of a wider set of local actors the marais poitevin catchment the clain catchment and the beauce aquifer which has nine ougcs covering one large aquifer these ougcs were selected to cover advanced and contrasting cases of collective management with well established decision making processes and allocation rules 21 additional actors were interviewed including irrigators local authorities and local representatives of state authorities environmental ngos and fisheries all interviews were semi directed with a duration of 1 2 h 4 results 4 1 legal entities in charge of ougcs and internal governance the survey s results shows that in the majority of cases oucgs are managed by purely agricultural legal entities chambers of agriculture coa 1 1 french chambers of agriculture coa are public institutions under the supervision of the state and administered by elected representatives from agricultural activities professional agricultural groups and forest owners established since 1924 they have a range of responsibilities and activities regarding the promotion of economic social and environmental performances of farm businesses as well as supporting implementation of public policies coas operate at county level 41 out of 54 ougcs see the full list in the supplementary material and associations or cooperatives of irrigators 7 five ougcs are managed by joint boards established between county councils and representatives of agricultural users usually coas one ougc i e case 22 in the supplementary material is managed by a public agency the main reasons reported by the experts we interviewed to explain why a specific legal entity was chosen are summarised in fig 3 below the choice of one legal entity reflects a trade off between internal and external legitimacy see also lafitte et al 2006 in most cases agricultural users saw irrigation management as a pure agricultural issue irrigator associations farmer cooperatives and coas were thus seen as the most legitimate entities amongst farmers by contrast the other legal forms reported i e joint boards and public agency exist where it was necessary to reinforce external legitimacy joint boards are in charge where public authorities have invested in and operate the infrastructure supporting the delivery of irrigation water the public agency was selected for the ougc marais poitevin 22 in response to intense local conflict between agricultural and nonagricultural stakeholders over the management of the largest wetland in france which is impacted by agricultural water extraction this model allows civil society e g recreational activities nature protection ngos to be involved in the design of ougc responses to reaching sels ougc internal governance is typically organised around a three tier committee system see fig 4 a high level board is responsible for approving all decisions board members are usually nominated amongst elected representatives of the legal entity in charge of the ougc e g coas counties and ougc members irrigators they are sometimes directly elected by ougc members when the ougc is an agricultural association or cooperative although the survey shows that this is not systematic depicted by sign on fig 4 the board establishes a technical committee to design allocation rules this committee also routinely implements those rules by developing yearly allocation plans which once developed are formally approved by the board when the board only includes agricultural actors a consultative committee may be set up to encourage dialogue with non farming actors and propose adjustments to solutions developed internally in the most participatory ougc e g those led by irrigator associations key decisions are validated in a general assembly of members the existence and composition of the different committees vary depending on the type of legal entity in charge of managing the ougc as illustrated in fig 4 this general framework is adapted to the size of each ougc in order to keep most participation and allocation decisions at a local level hence ougcs covering a very large territory may establish several separate technical committees for the different management units of the ougc area or for each county in a multi county ougc see section 4 2 4 2 ougc boundaries the survey s results show that the size of the ougcs in terms of area and number of irrigators vary widely the smallest ougcs extend over less than a hundred of square kilometres and have fewer than 100 irrigators e g 15 the largest extend over thousands of square kilometres and have more than 4 000 irrigators e g 25 most ougcs 40 out of 54 have been established following hydrological boundaries either a catchment an aquifer or an irrigation district supplied by a derivation canal one single legal entity may operate several ougcs especially when ougcs are located in the same county and can be managed by the relevant coa the intention is to benefit from economies of scale e g mutualisation of technical and administrative staff while boards govern allocation decisions independently this strategy has been adopted by the coa of the côte d or county which manages four ougcs see fig 5 case a when the hydrological unit is too large irrigators have sometimes decided to create several smaller ougcs this strategy may facilitate cooperation by reducing the number of members irrigators but may result in separate allocation rules in distinct parts of the same catchment the charente catchment illustrates this strategy three distinct ougcs are covering the upstream downstream and middle section of the basin see fig 5 case b there are nevertheless cases of very large ougcs covering catchments extending over several counties their board thus involve representatives from several coas and where included county councils because of different histories and priorities on water management obtaining a consensus on allocation rules may be challenging members of the ougc tarn follow this approach see fig 5 case c four ougcs were initially established along county boundaries each one being managed by a coa under state pressure the four ougcs merged and a single decisional body was set up where each coa has a number of votes proportional to the number of members another example is the ougc adour which is managed by a joint management board composed of representatives from the four coas and from each county councils see fig 5 case d instead of following hydrological boundaries 14 ougcs were formed along county administrative boundaries for example the ougc allier see fig 5 case e covers two distinct catchments allier cher but it does not integrate irrigators from those two basins who are located outside the county upstream or downstream the creation of two distinct ougcs each covering the whole allier and the cher catchments would have been more coherent with the 2006 law however the current set up ensures that irrigators from neighbouring counties do not influence the rules decided by the ougc allier another relevant example applies to the nine ougcs sharing the management of the beauce aquifer see fig 5 case f instead of creating a single very large ougc to manage the entire aquifer each of the county decided to create its own opting for different allocation rules largely based on historical practices 4 3 allocation rules 4 3 1 overview our survey suggests that allocation rules developed by ougcs generally follow a four step procedure to allocate water after presenting briefly these steps each sub section will report the very varied ways ougcs implemented them the first step aims at defining individual user caps iuc generally consisting of a maximum volume that can be extracted by one irrigator depicted with number in fig 6 iucs serve as an initial reference defining who can use water how much and when during the first allocation year it is often referred to as a reference value which subsequently serves as an upper benchmark for deciding annual allocations the second step specifies how iucs allocated in year 1 are progressively reduced to align the sum of all iucs with the sel this reduction is implemented over a transition period of 5 10 years depending of the level of effort required the third step involves the routine allocation performed on a yearly basis at the beginning of the year before planting decisions are made irrigators send to their ougc an individual demand form in which they specify the crops they intend to plant and the volume they would like to obtain the ougc checks the technical consistency between the volume requested and the projected crop area using crop water requirements ratios that correspond to efficient irrigation practices at this stage the ougc can reduce any demand considered unjustified from an agronomic perspective after this initial check the ougc will automatically accept all demands inferior or equal to the iuc if an irrigator asks more than his iuc his demand in excess of his iuc will be registered on a waiting list if the volume available at ougc level has not been entirely allocated the remaining resource will be granted to irrigators on the waiting list the objective being to minimise dormant volumes finally a fourth step allows adjusting allocations during the irrigation season based on weekly to monthly water use monitoring some ougcs identify members who might not consume all their allocated water and reallocate it temporarily to other irrigators who express additional need during the season some ougcs prone to drought risk have also defined procedures that will guide how temporary restrictions should apply if the available resource becomes insufficient to satisfy the granted allocations 4 3 2 setting individual user caps our survey shows that ougcs have designed two different types of iucs stable fixed caps that do not change over time and dynamic variable caps that evolve over time ougcs that adopted stable iucs e g 6 16 20 have used a historical reference usually defined as the average consumption over the last 5 15 years before the start of volumetric management or the maximum volume the irrigator extracted in any one of these years a dry year this stable iuc approach essentially embracing the grandfathering principle is politically more palatable than others because it provides considerable security to existing users and protects their business models which often rely on heavy investments related to irrigation this approach also preserves the market value of land and thereby protects the capital value of the farm ougcs that decided that iucs should evolve over time consider that the iuc itself should reflect the activity of the farm in order to avoid rigid inefficient apportionment of the resource some ougcs use a moving average of the volume of water extracted over a period of 2 10 years e g 31 33 in the most extreme cases ougcs allocate water based on what farmers plan to grow and irrigate in the coming season sometimes adjusted to soil types i e a farmer with thin soil will be entitled to more water per hectare than a farmer with thick soil if the total sum of individual demand is lower than the sel all demands are satisfied if not a uniform reduction coefficient is applied to all demands this approach is only feasible in ougcs where only small variations in individual demands are expected over years and the total demand is unlikely to increase for instance when most of the agricultural area that can be irrigated is already irrigated e g 2 3 15 17 in practice many ougcs combine different approaches for example the ougc isère 43 uses an iuc proportional to both historic extraction and planned irrigated area other ougcs such as the ougc adour 26 have decided to first adopt a stable cap but it has also set out a transition to use dynamic caps in the future based on crop soil and local climatic characteristics 4 3 3 reduction of individual user caps to achieve sel most ougcs have set initial iucs based on historical references acknowledging that the total volume allocated exceeded the sel their objective was to establish a system of iucs and have it accepted by users before starting to reduce water use and move towards sustainability these ougcs then had to design rules to reduce iucs our survey identifies three different approaches the first one consists in applying the commonly known use it or loose it approach hence the iuc of farmers who do not extract their full allowance will decrease in the following years the ougc assesses whether an irrigator consistently overestimates their needs by examining a period of three to five years and comparing it with other irrigators in the same catchment in order to account for local circumstances and the impact of wet and dry years on water demand the advantage of this approach is that it reduces dormant volumes however it fails to encourage irrigators to improve the efficiency of their irrigation practices because if they save water their volume is likely to be reduced this use or lose it approach have been adopted in many ougcs such as the ougc clain 20 the second approach consists in proportionally reducing all iucs uniformly over time for example the ougc buech 44 has set an uniform reduction of 5 on each cap in the first year 10 in the second year and 30 in the third year in the marais poitevin 22 each iuc was progressively reduced by 20 over six years given the uniform nature of the proportional rules some ougcs adopt additional rules to protect small volumes for example the ougc marais poitevin decided not to reduce iucs under 15 000 m3 similarly the ougc cogesteau 24 which has a large number of irrigators with small allocations has established a minimum threshold of 5000 m3 the third approach consists in maintaining iucs at their initial levels and applying to all caps a yearly reduction coefficient that reflects resource availability for example the ougcs of the beauce aquifer 3 11 and the ougc rochefoucault 25 implement a uniform reduction coefficient on iucs to take into account the recharge level of the aquifer at the end of winter an advantage of this strategy is that it allows use of more water when the aquifer is fully recharged after a series of wet years many ougcs e g 20 22 23 46 50 aim to develop alternative water resources which are hydrologically independent from the resource managed by the ougc in order to maintain iucs at their historical levels while simultaneously meeting sel these resources include inter basin transfers or the construction of off stream reservoirs refilled through overland run off or pumped instream flow or groundwater during the winter when extraction a priori does not impact minimum flows 4 3 4 temporary reallocation procedures from one year to another the quantity of water needed by each individual irrigator is likely to diminish or increase depending on a number of individual constraints or strategies market or climate fluctuations in addition to the yearly allocation plan described in section 4 3 1 ougcs have established rules allowing temporary reallocations during the irrigation season farmers are asked to report meter readings on a regular monthly weekly basis the ougc can then identify irrigators who are under using their allocation the ougc can then take the decision to authorize other users to increase extraction this temporary reallocation is strictly managed by the ougc in order to avoid the emergence of informal water markets irrigators are not allowed to transfer volumes without an authorisation from the ougc furthermore ougc have set limits to reallocations in the ougc champigny 2 for example an irrigator can only increase its annual allocation through a temporary reallocation of a maximum of 15 of its initial allocation several ougcs have also developed rules to adapt allocations during dry years e g 12 18 20 17 31 33 it is important to recall that ougcs routinely allocate a volume corresponding to the sel which is by definition the quantity of water that is statistically available 4 years out of 5 hence 1 year out 5 on average restrictions must be implemented our survey shows that ougcs rely on three mechanisms to adjust allocation during dry years the first mechanism is the drought management approach that pre existed volumetric management see section 2 water use is restricted if minimum river flow or groundwater level thresholds set by the state are breached the second mechanism consists in breaking down iucs into weekly or bi weekly caps usually a percentage of the iuc farmers then lose flexibility in how to use their annual iuc as weekly use becomes constrained this approach is implemented once the minimum river flows or aquifer levels are reached although in some cases it is implemented before these levels are reached in order to delay state imposed time restrictions the ougc clain 20 implements this approach in some sub units the third mechanism establishes irrigation schedules during which irrigators rotate extraction in order to minimise the instantaneous cumulative impact of multiple extraction points the ougc tarn 31 implements this approach in some sub units it has designed different rotation schedules depending on whether the minimum thresholds are breached or about to be breached in order to delay the imposition of stricter state imposed time restrictions 4 3 5 planning for new irrigators while ougcs first grant access to water to historical irrigators they have developed different policies concerning the entry of new irrigators some ougcs may reject all newcomers unless the sum of iucs is lower than sel the ougc allier 16 for example rejects new requests on the main stem of the river allier but still accept new members in other management areas others e g 2 9 10 accept incorporating new irrigators even in fully allocated catchments and aquifers existing users then have to squeeze to free up water for the new comers intermediate situations exist where the ougc uses a reserve of iucs which can then be used to allocate water to new entrants some ougcs e g 12 17 have set aside a reserve at the onset of volumetric management which they will use to serve new irrigators until the reserve is exhausted for example the ougc yèvre auron 12 has put 5 of its sel aside the reserve can also be dynamic and continuously build up by tapping into iucs of existing claimants thereby progressively reducing their share of water we found three strategies ougcs use to build up an iuc reserve the first one e g used by 17 consists in setting aside iucs from users who systematically use less water than they were allocated use it or lose it rule the second strategy consists of retaining each year from each user a small percentage of their iuc see e g 2 the third strategy consists in retaining a percentage of an iuc when it is transferred from one user to another for example when a farm is sold e g up to 20 of the original iuc in the ougc marais poitevin where ougcs do not accept new irrigators the only possibility to obtain an iuc is to purchase irrigated land from an authorized user ougcs usually approve the simultaneous transfer of irrigated land and the associated iuc to preserve the value of the transferred assets i e land machinery irrigation equipment the ougc can refuse the transfer if the buyer does not meet a number of conditions defined by the board this is to emphasise that water is not a commodity like land it is a common good and that the ougc has the final say over how iucs are transferred where new irrigators are accepted some ougcs e g 2 have opted for a simple waiting list applying the principle first come first served others e g 22 24 have developed a more sophisticated approach to prioritise applicants based on various criteria reflecting the dominant social political and ethical values of ougc members table 1 some criteria emphasise social justice for instance by allocating water first to small and young farmers others promote economic efficiency by granting water first to farmers with high added value crops or farms with a high employment ratio 4 4 monitoring and compliance the main role of ougcs is to prepare the annual allocation plan any irrigator extracting water within their area and not appearing on the allocation plan faces sanctions from state authorities as a result ougcs spent significant resources raising awareness amongst irrigators of the need to report their past extraction and irrigation water demand in order to avoid losing future access to their share of the local water resources often the pre existing register maintained by state and river basin authorities lacked sufficient systematic coverage due to poor reporting by irrigators and the lack of appropriate follow up by authorities on the ground in exchange of improving the inventory of extraction points and the volumes extracted ougcs negotiated with state authorities that users and extraction points not previously legally declared could still be included in the first allocation plans this initial inventory phase has led to significant improvements on who extracts water where how much and when ougcs have a legal duty to report annually to the state the iuc of each irrigator and their final extracted volume thus each year ougcs request meter readings from each irrigators for each extraction point reporting occurs through phone calls email or paper forms although most ougcs are developing internet platforms and mobile applications to report information electronically some ougcs e g 22 are developing telemetry reporting technology regarding compliance the state remains responsible for imposing sanctions ougcs have been reluctant to implement their own penalties due to legal uncertainties and lack of acceptability amongst their members most ougcs only implement sanctions on farmers failing to report water use information or refusing to pay the ougc membership fee since these prerogatives are clearly laid down in the 2006 water law some ougcs e g 12 22 apply penalties to farmers exceeding their annual allocation in the form of a reduced water allocation the following year although proposals for financial penalties for such non compliance issue also exist e g 49 5 assessment of the policy reform outcomes the devolution of allocation decisions to ougcs was intended to increase self compliance of the agricultural sector to extraction caps this paper set out to assess more than 10 years after the principle was enacted in law whether the paradigm shift has taken place has a collective approach within the agricultural community become a reality and have local actors exploited the considerable leeway offered to them by the law to develop solutions adapted to local specific characteristics has collective management improved environmental economic and social performance what are the remaining challenges 5 1 the emergence of collective action the implementation of the 2006 water law suffered relatively long delays and initial resistance to change many irrigators complained that the reform was imposed on users rather than emanating from them therefore questioning the legitimacy of the future ougcs however the results of our survey suggest that agricultural water users have finally appropriated the reform leading to 54 functioning ougcs established in all priority areas and beyond the creation of the ougcs has undeniably improved users knowledge on local water resources as well as the monitoring and reporting of water use this is arguably the first essential step towards self regulation ostrom 1990 despite the widespread feelings of private ownership that irrigators have regarding their iucs ougcs have played an important role in developing a sense of common ownership over the resource this is evidenced by the terminology adopted such as reference volume instead of entitlements and the emphasis given on the revocable nature of individual allocations this clearly provides more leverage and flexibility to ougcs for tackling over allocation and resource depletion issues than they would have with a system of more secure individual water use rights as evidenced by experiences with water users associations in other countries see rinaudo and donoso 2018 for a case in chile the benefits of having a collective permit for the bulk allocation managed by the ougc instead of individual extraction permits should not be underestimated thanks to the legal backing ougcs became the primary point of contact for any irrigator wanting to extract water legally at the same time the collective license formalises the notion that individual allocations arise from a shared and limited resource as holley and sinclair 2014 suggest a collective license can contribute to strengthen collective action as it creates institutional inter dependence between irrigators ougcs being in charge of the bulk allocation they have reinforced controls on how water is reallocated between farmers in order to optimise collective benefits our survey clearly shows that stakeholders involved in the establishment of ougcs have fully used the leeway that was offered to them by the legislator ougcs present a wide diversity of choices in terms of legal entity in charge boundaries internal governance allocation rules and compliance rules the feasibility of the reform was enhanced because local solutions could be developed to take into account local historical political institutional and agricultural specificities 5 2 environmental performance the success of the reform is less obvious from an environmental point of view and problems remain in a number of situations the first one is where environmental problems persist mainly because the sel was over estimated for many reasons ranging from insufficient scientific knowledge to political pressure exerted by farmers representatives arnaud 2020 the second situation is where users negotiated a delay in achieving sels by way of exemptions in the hope that offline storage reservoirs or inter basin transfers could be created see section 4 3 3 see also douez et al 2020 meanwhile current use remains at historical levels and resources are over exploited generating environmental problems the situation should theoretically improve when substitution resources are developed however their construction is hampered by financial constraints and an increasing opposition from various ngos and social groups an abrupt imposition of iucs is possible if the infrastructure is not built by the exemption deadline in 2021 in many cases nevertheless the establishment of ougcs addressed environmental problems in other ways because sel must take into account resource characteristics and groundwater surface interactions the creation of ougcs has reinforced farmers awareness of hydrological dynamics and the interconnectivity of surface and groundwater resources ougcs have crafted refined allocation rules that take into account these hydrological realities similarly ougcs have improved local knowledge on extraction points and the volumes and timing of extraction this more detailed understanding has enabled ougcs to take measures to reduce extraction from wells boreholes or pumping stations in rivers that have the highest environmental impacts on the aquatic environment thereby also benefiting farmers by reducing the likelihood of use restrictions ougcs have started to relocate these extraction points onto lower impact wells e g further away from the river stem or deeper more plentiful groundwater several ougcs have developed rules to improve real time management of extraction during the peak season section 4 3 4 improved monitoring and communication between users allow optimisation of the spatial and temporal patterns of extraction in order to minimise environmental problems and the induced risks of administrative use restrictions 5 3 economic and social performance assessing the economic and social impact of the reform is complex considering how little temporal hindsight we have and the lack of data on water use productivity however our observations still suggest that ougcs have paid significant attention to the issue of efficiency and equity when developing their rules in particular those dealing with short and long term reallocations while the economic literature often suggests than efficient reallocation can only occur through market mechanisms the french case suggests instead that users can take economic efficiency into account when making reallocation decisions for example by prioritising reallocation to higher value crops or those generating added value in the basin unlike market based reallocation users can integrate a range of additional criteria in their decisions local priorities for employment rural development and environmental targets thus internalising what economists consider as market externalities allocation rules also suggest that a broad range of distributive social justice dimensions were taken into account several design options explored by rinaudo et al 2016 have been adopted reflecting various local preferences by ougcs regarding the legitimacy of grandfathering merit equal opportunities and equal treatment between irrigators 5 4 remaining challenges the shift from an individual to a collective water allocation regime is a far reaching reform its implementation will take place over many more years during which ougcs will face several challenges a first challenge is related to procedural justice in rule definition and implementation although the state is theoretically the guarantor of the general interest and must ensure fair treatment of users within the ougc there is always a risk that powerful coalitions of farmers influence the design and implementation of rules in their favour rent seeking behaviours could appear within the collective organisation itself resulting in the long term appropriation of water by historical users the lack of effective reallocation rules and the establishment of entry barriers ultimately leading to unequal and inefficient water allocation to mitigate that risk transparency and robust monitoring is necessary skurray 2015 as well as building the right governance structures within the ougc to build social capital lópez gunn 2012 second while we can expect that collective water management approach will be successfully implemented in catchment and aquifer systems with high storage and buffer capacity the situation is likely to be more challenging in more reactive and unregulated systems where the available resource highly fluctuates highly during each season and over years this issue will be compounded by the application of the use it or loose it rule which will narrow the gap between average water extraction and the extraction caps hence potentially making catchments more vulnerable to droughts ougcs will thus have to design rules to manage drought periods possibly adapting iucs to climatic and resource conditions at the beginning of the season or defining iucs as shares rather than nominal volumes young 2014 the use of monthly or weekly use caps might be required as practiced in some ougcs already this will increase the complexity of existing allocation rules require more intensive water use monitoring and overall increase risks of user non compliance and conflicts within the users community the third challenge will consist in developing mechanisms to enforce ougcs rules one of the reasons the state was keen to devolve the responsibility of water allocation to users was to support the enforcement of extraction caps an issue which has been clearly pointed out as a problem in france montginoul et al 2020 however with no backing from the legal framework most ougcs are reluctant to take over the responsibility for sanctioning non complying users hence the majority of ougcs consider that it should remain in the hands of the state in that context ougcs should be more clearly empowered with compliance roles in the same fashion as spanish water user associations lópez gunn and cortina 2006 or californian groundwater sustainability agencies kiparsky et al 2017 new enforcement mechanisms should also be explored see figureau et al 2015 still the success of the reform will depend on the capacity of the state to represent a credible threat to local users and step in when collective management fails holley and sinclair 2014 molle and closas 2020a 6 conclusion the paper explored the scope for user based allocations when the goal is to increase environmental sustainability it focused on a reform that promotes the shift from an individual to a collective water allocation regime one of the interesting characteristics of this reform imposed by the state lies in the fact that users had significant leeway to adapt its implementation locally this may explain why user groups were able to design a variety of allocation rules taking into account user needs and local priorities while at the same time considering water resource characteristics although implementation challenges remain the ougc system increases transparency on who benefits from water use and reinforces the notion that water is a common property it provides new opportunities to share water more equitably while supporting strategic choices on crop productions and associated value chains the french model of collective management of water allocations thus offers a fresh but valuable approach to improve the regulation of

10572,regulating water use in agriculture in water stressed basins is a challenging task recent scholarship emphasises the need to combine strong state oversight for achieving the collective extraction caps with considerable leeway to users to allocate water according to local priorities this form of co management between the state and users aims to improve the implementation of sustainable extraction limits this model was adopted in france where agricultural user groups share water resources within a capped allocation pool enforced by the state this paper evaluates whether the allocation rules developed by user groups improve environmental economic and social performance a detailed survey was carried out amongst the 54 agricultural user groups created across france results suggest that the reform has led to greater awareness amongst irrigators of their water resources and the slow emergence of collective action allocation rules have been developed reflecting local economic and social priorities as well as the temporal and spatial dynamics of local surface and groundwater resources although challenges remain the research presented in this paper supports co management to manage agricultural water extraction and discusses institutional design features that can facilitate its implementation keywords water scarcity drought common property management collective action regulation 1 introduction recent decades have seen a significant increase in water extraction one main driver being agricultural irrigation by adopting irrigation farmers have boosted yields and reduced the risk of crop failure in dry years contributing to reduce poverty and fuelling growth in many rural areas around the world however as river basins and aquifers become more intensively exploited and climate change intensifies and lengthens drought events water demand can outstrip water availability groundwater mining is a major threat in many arid countries famiglietti 2014 in temperate regions intensive seasonal extraction in rivers and shallow aquifers exacerbates summer low flows in rivers leading to higher pollution concentration and the drying up of permanent streams de graaf et al 2019 to avoid resource exhaustion and protect aquatic ecosystems authorities around the world are adopting stricter controls on water extraction in particular from irrigated agriculture eea 2009 oecd 2015 gruère et al 2018 one common policy response has been to define sustainable extraction limits sel or caps that ensure water extraction is set at levels that protect access to the resource for future generations and avoid environmental impacts individual allocations are then defined entitling each user to a share of the sel in the form of an extraction quota such cap and allocate systems are usually run by public authorities with the idea that the state can protect the general interest maximise welfare and ensure accountable decisions due to public scrutiny however experience has shown that the acceptability of state run allocation regimes can be low amongst local communities and users bruns et al 2005 in addition the lack of human and financial capacities of public authorities to monitor compliance over thousands of extraction points often means that rules are poorly enforced which further hinder their legitimacy and effectiveness molle and closas 2020b instead of public authorities water users can be given the responsibility of setting caps and allocating water in a form of self governance scholars have observed that users organised in water user associations can establish long enduring institutions supporting complex allocation decisions e g ostrom 1990 allocation decisions made by users are deemed more acceptable because they are empirically grounded and locally negotiated resulting in a close fit with local resource conditions histories and needs however scholars highlight that users may lack commitment where the perceived benefits of imposing restrictions exceed the perceived costs for example when sels focus on reserving enough water to protect aquatic biodiversity at the expense of farmers income esteban and albiac 2012 hence most reported cases of user based allocations refer to user groups created to share water supplied by a common infrastructure e g collective irrigation schemes see e g tang 1992 or to share water from a resource facing exhaustion see e g blomquist 1992 in that context a growing literature is exploring more closely how state and users can best share powers and responsibilities to improve the performance of sels and allocation systems schlager and lopez gunn 2006 cases include spain lópez gunn and cortina 2006 closas et al 2017 mexico wester et al 2011 australia skurray 2015 shalsi et al 2019 the us hoffman and zellmer 2013 kiparsky et al 2017 and new zealand boone and fragaszy 2018 in their recent review of groundwater co management molle and closas 2020a argue that the state should allow maximum autonomy to user groups while providing for a clear shadow of hierarchy or credible threat if users do not act collectively without state intervention this paper reports the experience of france which since 2006 has progressively moved away from a state centred approach in order to devolve allocation decisions over irrigation water to agricultural water user groups after more than 10 years of implementation 54 user groups have been created throughout france this paper presents the first in depth and systematic analysis based on intensive fieldwork of these newly established user groups and the allocation rules they have established the evaluation of these institutional arrangements will be of interest for other scholars authorities and stakeholders working on the self regulation of agricultural water extraction this paper is organised as follows section 2 first provides an overview of the french regulatory regime on water extraction in particular its approach to devolution the methodology and the material collected are then presented section 3 section 4 describes the results of a national survey on the governance arrangements and allocation rules designed by these user groups finally the paper reflects on the diversity of observed institutions and draws conclusions on the capacity of hybrid state user allocation systems to develop fair efficient and environmentally effective sharing rules section 5 2 the regulation of irrigation water extraction in france irrigated agriculture started to expand significantly in france following a major drought that struck french agriculture at the end of the 1970s irrigated agriculture now covers about 2 million ha across france it accounts for 50 of net water use and up to 80 during the dry season the peak demand coinciding with seasonal river low flows in the late 1980s as conflicts between users were increasing the french authorities started to regulate water extraction by setting river minimum flow and aquifer level thresholds below which temporary restrictions on water use in the form of a time ban on irrigation imposed at specific hours and days of the week were implemented these thresholds were set to ensure the survival of fish populations and more generally the sustainability of aquatic ecosystems because this first regulation was ineffective see rinaudo 2020 the french authorities developed a new approach based on volumetric management this approach relied on three pillars systematic metering of all water extraction the definition of sels at catchment or aquifer level and the allocation of individual user caps iucs the expected advantage of this new approach was to reduce uncertainty each user receiving a reduced but guaranteed allocated volume for the whole irrigation season this approach tested in a few catchments in the 1990s was made compulsory for all priority catchments and aquifers across france under the 2006 water law the current french water allocation regime essentially operates within a nested system of targets and rules at river basin district level river basin committees comprising of representatives of the state regional and local governments users and environmental ngos co design river basin management plans in which they set environmental flow targets at key nodes of the river basin in line with the requirements of the eu water framework directive wfd at catchment or aquifer level a nested local plan is developed by local water commissions setting environmental flow targets and aquifer threshold levels at a finer scale in priority basins this local plan also defines sels that guarantee that environmental objectives will be met four years out of five sels are specified in volumetric units for each management area and for each season usually divided into wet and dry season management areas must be hydrologically coherent units corresponding to sub catchment parts of a sub catchment or different aquifers connected or not connected to surface water once sels for each management area are set the local water commission divides the available water between economic sectors all agricultural irrigators must join a user group called the single collective management organisation organisme unique de gestion collective hereafter ougc which is entrusted with the responsibility of managing the bulk volume allocated to agriculture this ougc receives a permit corresponding to the bulk allocation and the state cancels all permits which were previously granted to individual users the ougc must then define rules on how the bulk allocation will be shared amongst their members a number of studies undertaken to define sels concluded that agricultural extraction should be reduced by 10 20 in most catchments and by over 50 in some cases arnaud 2020 one of the key choices made by the legislator was to give considerable leeway to ougcs to establish locally adapted governance and allocation rules the law neither specifies the scale at which ougcs must be formed nor the type of legal entity which can act as ougc it does not impose any specific internal governance structure nor does it prescribe how to share water amongst ougc members and how to reach sels the few legal constraint are i the ougc must both represents irrigators and supports the state in implementing an effective control on extraction ii all irrigators should be treated equally and fairly and iii rules must be transparent to members of the ougc and outlined in an internal rulebook finally the state must validate the choice of legal entity managing the ougc and the yearly allocation plan it also retains responsibility for imposing sanctions on users not following their ougc s decisions the ougc may nevertheless provide for complementary sanctions ougcs were progressively established between 2010 and 2018 as part of a very decentralized policy driven by state administration operating at county level départements although previous studies have highlighted the potential for a diversity of rules established by ougc loubier and polge 2016 rinaudo and hérivaux 2016 no systematic analysis of the internal governance of ougcs and the rules they developed has been carried out up to now this paper fills this gap 3 material and method a survey of collective irrigation water management association our methodology consisted of three steps fig 1 in the first step an internet search and interviews of national water management experts led to the identification of 54 ougcs across france fig 2 official documents related to the establishment of ougcs were collected in particular administrative authorisation specifying the legal entity managing the ougc bulk allocation permits measures required to reduce the environmental impact of extraction internal rulebooks presenting the governance of the ougc allocation rules financing arrangements monitoring and compliance other documents such as hydrological studies conducted to set the sels application forms submitted by the ougc to obtain the bulk allocation permit annual allocation plans irrigation campaign reports a full list of ougc is provided in the supplementary material in the results section specific cases presented in the supplementary material will be referred to using the sign in the second step 25 ougcs were selected for further investigation they were selected paying attention to the diversity of institutional design choices and their spatial distribution across france interviews were held with managers of these 25 ougcs to better understand the reasons underpinning the choice of the legal entity put in charge of the ougc their spatial boundaries allocation rules and enforcement arrangements in addition 11 national and regional experts with broad views of ougc development were interviewed they were selected to cover the main national and regional stakeholders including state authorities responsible for regulating water extraction water agencies implementing the wfd national representatives of the agricultural sector and environmental ngos and researchers in the third step three case studies representing 12 ougcs in total were selected to examine the views of a wider set of local actors the marais poitevin catchment the clain catchment and the beauce aquifer which has nine ougcs covering one large aquifer these ougcs were selected to cover advanced and contrasting cases of collective management with well established decision making processes and allocation rules 21 additional actors were interviewed including irrigators local authorities and local representatives of state authorities environmental ngos and fisheries all interviews were semi directed with a duration of 1 2 h 4 results 4 1 legal entities in charge of ougcs and internal governance the survey s results shows that in the majority of cases oucgs are managed by purely agricultural legal entities chambers of agriculture coa 1 1 french chambers of agriculture coa are public institutions under the supervision of the state and administered by elected representatives from agricultural activities professional agricultural groups and forest owners established since 1924 they have a range of responsibilities and activities regarding the promotion of economic social and environmental performances of farm businesses as well as supporting implementation of public policies coas operate at county level 41 out of 54 ougcs see the full list in the supplementary material and associations or cooperatives of irrigators 7 five ougcs are managed by joint boards established between county councils and representatives of agricultural users usually coas one ougc i e case 22 in the supplementary material is managed by a public agency the main reasons reported by the experts we interviewed to explain why a specific legal entity was chosen are summarised in fig 3 below the choice of one legal entity reflects a trade off between internal and external legitimacy see also lafitte et al 2006 in most cases agricultural users saw irrigation management as a pure agricultural issue irrigator associations farmer cooperatives and coas were thus seen as the most legitimate entities amongst farmers by contrast the other legal forms reported i e joint boards and public agency exist where it was necessary to reinforce external legitimacy joint boards are in charge where public authorities have invested in and operate the infrastructure supporting the delivery of irrigation water the public agency was selected for the ougc marais poitevin 22 in response to intense local conflict between agricultural and nonagricultural stakeholders over the management of the largest wetland in france which is impacted by agricultural water extraction this model allows civil society e g recreational activities nature protection ngos to be involved in the design of ougc responses to reaching sels ougc internal governance is typically organised around a three tier committee system see fig 4 a high level board is responsible for approving all decisions board members are usually nominated amongst elected representatives of the legal entity in charge of the ougc e g coas counties and ougc members irrigators they are sometimes directly elected by ougc members when the ougc is an agricultural association or cooperative although the survey shows that this is not systematic depicted by sign on fig 4 the board establishes a technical committee to design allocation rules this committee also routinely implements those rules by developing yearly allocation plans which once developed are formally approved by the board when the board only includes agricultural actors a consultative committee may be set up to encourage dialogue with non farming actors and propose adjustments to solutions developed internally in the most participatory ougc e g those led by irrigator associations key decisions are validated in a general assembly of members the existence and composition of the different committees vary depending on the type of legal entity in charge of managing the ougc as illustrated in fig 4 this general framework is adapted to the size of each ougc in order to keep most participation and allocation decisions at a local level hence ougcs covering a very large territory may establish several separate technical committees for the different management units of the ougc area or for each county in a multi county ougc see section 4 2 4 2 ougc boundaries the survey s results show that the size of the ougcs in terms of area and number of irrigators vary widely the smallest ougcs extend over less than a hundred of square kilometres and have fewer than 100 irrigators e g 15 the largest extend over thousands of square kilometres and have more than 4 000 irrigators e g 25 most ougcs 40 out of 54 have been established following hydrological boundaries either a catchment an aquifer or an irrigation district supplied by a derivation canal one single legal entity may operate several ougcs especially when ougcs are located in the same county and can be managed by the relevant coa the intention is to benefit from economies of scale e g mutualisation of technical and administrative staff while boards govern allocation decisions independently this strategy has been adopted by the coa of the côte d or county which manages four ougcs see fig 5 case a when the hydrological unit is too large irrigators have sometimes decided to create several smaller ougcs this strategy may facilitate cooperation by reducing the number of members irrigators but may result in separate allocation rules in distinct parts of the same catchment the charente catchment illustrates this strategy three distinct ougcs are covering the upstream downstream and middle section of the basin see fig 5 case b there are nevertheless cases of very large ougcs covering catchments extending over several counties their board thus involve representatives from several coas and where included county councils because of different histories and priorities on water management obtaining a consensus on allocation rules may be challenging members of the ougc tarn follow this approach see fig 5 case c four ougcs were initially established along county boundaries each one being managed by a coa under state pressure the four ougcs merged and a single decisional body was set up where each coa has a number of votes proportional to the number of members another example is the ougc adour which is managed by a joint management board composed of representatives from the four coas and from each county councils see fig 5 case d instead of following hydrological boundaries 14 ougcs were formed along county administrative boundaries for example the ougc allier see fig 5 case e covers two distinct catchments allier cher but it does not integrate irrigators from those two basins who are located outside the county upstream or downstream the creation of two distinct ougcs each covering the whole allier and the cher catchments would have been more coherent with the 2006 law however the current set up ensures that irrigators from neighbouring counties do not influence the rules decided by the ougc allier another relevant example applies to the nine ougcs sharing the management of the beauce aquifer see fig 5 case f instead of creating a single very large ougc to manage the entire aquifer each of the county decided to create its own opting for different allocation rules largely based on historical practices 4 3 allocation rules 4 3 1 overview our survey suggests that allocation rules developed by ougcs generally follow a four step procedure to allocate water after presenting briefly these steps each sub section will report the very varied ways ougcs implemented them the first step aims at defining individual user caps iuc generally consisting of a maximum volume that can be extracted by one irrigator depicted with number in fig 6 iucs serve as an initial reference defining who can use water how much and when during the first allocation year it is often referred to as a reference value which subsequently serves as an upper benchmark for deciding annual allocations the second step specifies how iucs allocated in year 1 are progressively reduced to align the sum of all iucs with the sel this reduction is implemented over a transition period of 5 10 years depending of the level of effort required the third step involves the routine allocation performed on a yearly basis at the beginning of the year before planting decisions are made irrigators send to their ougc an individual demand form in which they specify the crops they intend to plant and the volume they would like to obtain the ougc checks the technical consistency between the volume requested and the projected crop area using crop water requirements ratios that correspond to efficient irrigation practices at this stage the ougc can reduce any demand considered unjustified from an agronomic perspective after this initial check the ougc will automatically accept all demands inferior or equal to the iuc if an irrigator asks more than his iuc his demand in excess of his iuc will be registered on a waiting list if the volume available at ougc level has not been entirely allocated the remaining resource will be granted to irrigators on the waiting list the objective being to minimise dormant volumes finally a fourth step allows adjusting allocations during the irrigation season based on weekly to monthly water use monitoring some ougcs identify members who might not consume all their allocated water and reallocate it temporarily to other irrigators who express additional need during the season some ougcs prone to drought risk have also defined procedures that will guide how temporary restrictions should apply if the available resource becomes insufficient to satisfy the granted allocations 4 3 2 setting individual user caps our survey shows that ougcs have designed two different types of iucs stable fixed caps that do not change over time and dynamic variable caps that evolve over time ougcs that adopted stable iucs e g 6 16 20 have used a historical reference usually defined as the average consumption over the last 5 15 years before the start of volumetric management or the maximum volume the irrigator extracted in any one of these years a dry year this stable iuc approach essentially embracing the grandfathering principle is politically more palatable than others because it provides considerable security to existing users and protects their business models which often rely on heavy investments related to irrigation this approach also preserves the market value of land and thereby protects the capital value of the farm ougcs that decided that iucs should evolve over time consider that the iuc itself should reflect the activity of the farm in order to avoid rigid inefficient apportionment of the resource some ougcs use a moving average of the volume of water extracted over a period of 2 10 years e g 31 33 in the most extreme cases ougcs allocate water based on what farmers plan to grow and irrigate in the coming season sometimes adjusted to soil types i e a farmer with thin soil will be entitled to more water per hectare than a farmer with thick soil if the total sum of individual demand is lower than the sel all demands are satisfied if not a uniform reduction coefficient is applied to all demands this approach is only feasible in ougcs where only small variations in individual demands are expected over years and the total demand is unlikely to increase for instance when most of the agricultural area that can be irrigated is already irrigated e g 2 3 15 17 in practice many ougcs combine different approaches for example the ougc isère 43 uses an iuc proportional to both historic extraction and planned irrigated area other ougcs such as the ougc adour 26 have decided to first adopt a stable cap but it has also set out a transition to use dynamic caps in the future based on crop soil and local climatic characteristics 4 3 3 reduction of individual user caps to achieve sel most ougcs have set initial iucs based on historical references acknowledging that the total volume allocated exceeded the sel their objective was to establish a system of iucs and have it accepted by users before starting to reduce water use and move towards sustainability these ougcs then had to design rules to reduce iucs our survey identifies three different approaches the first one consists in applying the commonly known use it or loose it approach hence the iuc of farmers who do not extract their full allowance will decrease in the following years the ougc assesses whether an irrigator consistently overestimates their needs by examining a period of three to five years and comparing it with other irrigators in the same catchment in order to account for local circumstances and the impact of wet and dry years on water demand the advantage of this approach is that it reduces dormant volumes however it fails to encourage irrigators to improve the efficiency of their irrigation practices because if they save water their volume is likely to be reduced this use or lose it approach have been adopted in many ougcs such as the ougc clain 20 the second approach consists in proportionally reducing all iucs uniformly over time for example the ougc buech 44 has set an uniform reduction of 5 on each cap in the first year 10 in the second year and 30 in the third year in the marais poitevin 22 each iuc was progressively reduced by 20 over six years given the uniform nature of the proportional rules some ougcs adopt additional rules to protect small volumes for example the ougc marais poitevin decided not to reduce iucs under 15 000 m3 similarly the ougc cogesteau 24 which has a large number of irrigators with small allocations has established a minimum threshold of 5000 m3 the third approach consists in maintaining iucs at their initial levels and applying to all caps a yearly reduction coefficient that reflects resource availability for example the ougcs of the beauce aquifer 3 11 and the ougc rochefoucault 25 implement a uniform reduction coefficient on iucs to take into account the recharge level of the aquifer at the end of winter an advantage of this strategy is that it allows use of more water when the aquifer is fully recharged after a series of wet years many ougcs e g 20 22 23 46 50 aim to develop alternative water resources which are hydrologically independent from the resource managed by the ougc in order to maintain iucs at their historical levels while simultaneously meeting sel these resources include inter basin transfers or the construction of off stream reservoirs refilled through overland run off or pumped instream flow or groundwater during the winter when extraction a priori does not impact minimum flows 4 3 4 temporary reallocation procedures from one year to another the quantity of water needed by each individual irrigator is likely to diminish or increase depending on a number of individual constraints or strategies market or climate fluctuations in addition to the yearly allocation plan described in section 4 3 1 ougcs have established rules allowing temporary reallocations during the irrigation season farmers are asked to report meter readings on a regular monthly weekly basis the ougc can then identify irrigators who are under using their allocation the ougc can then take the decision to authorize other users to increase extraction this temporary reallocation is strictly managed by the ougc in order to avoid the emergence of informal water markets irrigators are not allowed to transfer volumes without an authorisation from the ougc furthermore ougc have set limits to reallocations in the ougc champigny 2 for example an irrigator can only increase its annual allocation through a temporary reallocation of a maximum of 15 of its initial allocation several ougcs have also developed rules to adapt allocations during dry years e g 12 18 20 17 31 33 it is important to recall that ougcs routinely allocate a volume corresponding to the sel which is by definition the quantity of water that is statistically available 4 years out of 5 hence 1 year out 5 on average restrictions must be implemented our survey shows that ougcs rely on three mechanisms to adjust allocation during dry years the first mechanism is the drought management approach that pre existed volumetric management see section 2 water use is restricted if minimum river flow or groundwater level thresholds set by the state are breached the second mechanism consists in breaking down iucs into weekly or bi weekly caps usually a percentage of the iuc farmers then lose flexibility in how to use their annual iuc as weekly use becomes constrained this approach is implemented once the minimum river flows or aquifer levels are reached although in some cases it is implemented before these levels are reached in order to delay state imposed time restrictions the ougc clain 20 implements this approach in some sub units the third mechanism establishes irrigation schedules during which irrigators rotate extraction in order to minimise the instantaneous cumulative impact of multiple extraction points the ougc tarn 31 implements this approach in some sub units it has designed different rotation schedules depending on whether the minimum thresholds are breached or about to be breached in order to delay the imposition of stricter state imposed time restrictions 4 3 5 planning for new irrigators while ougcs first grant access to water to historical irrigators they have developed different policies concerning the entry of new irrigators some ougcs may reject all newcomers unless the sum of iucs is lower than sel the ougc allier 16 for example rejects new requests on the main stem of the river allier but still accept new members in other management areas others e g 2 9 10 accept incorporating new irrigators even in fully allocated catchments and aquifers existing users then have to squeeze to free up water for the new comers intermediate situations exist where the ougc uses a reserve of iucs which can then be used to allocate water to new entrants some ougcs e g 12 17 have set aside a reserve at the onset of volumetric management which they will use to serve new irrigators until the reserve is exhausted for example the ougc yèvre auron 12 has put 5 of its sel aside the reserve can also be dynamic and continuously build up by tapping into iucs of existing claimants thereby progressively reducing their share of water we found three strategies ougcs use to build up an iuc reserve the first one e g used by 17 consists in setting aside iucs from users who systematically use less water than they were allocated use it or lose it rule the second strategy consists of retaining each year from each user a small percentage of their iuc see e g 2 the third strategy consists in retaining a percentage of an iuc when it is transferred from one user to another for example when a farm is sold e g up to 20 of the original iuc in the ougc marais poitevin where ougcs do not accept new irrigators the only possibility to obtain an iuc is to purchase irrigated land from an authorized user ougcs usually approve the simultaneous transfer of irrigated land and the associated iuc to preserve the value of the transferred assets i e land machinery irrigation equipment the ougc can refuse the transfer if the buyer does not meet a number of conditions defined by the board this is to emphasise that water is not a commodity like land it is a common good and that the ougc has the final say over how iucs are transferred where new irrigators are accepted some ougcs e g 2 have opted for a simple waiting list applying the principle first come first served others e g 22 24 have developed a more sophisticated approach to prioritise applicants based on various criteria reflecting the dominant social political and ethical values of ougc members table 1 some criteria emphasise social justice for instance by allocating water first to small and young farmers others promote economic efficiency by granting water first to farmers with high added value crops or farms with a high employment ratio 4 4 monitoring and compliance the main role of ougcs is to prepare the annual allocation plan any irrigator extracting water within their area and not appearing on the allocation plan faces sanctions from state authorities as a result ougcs spent significant resources raising awareness amongst irrigators of the need to report their past extraction and irrigation water demand in order to avoid losing future access to their share of the local water resources often the pre existing register maintained by state and river basin authorities lacked sufficient systematic coverage due to poor reporting by irrigators and the lack of appropriate follow up by authorities on the ground in exchange of improving the inventory of extraction points and the volumes extracted ougcs negotiated with state authorities that users and extraction points not previously legally declared could still be included in the first allocation plans this initial inventory phase has led to significant improvements on who extracts water where how much and when ougcs have a legal duty to report annually to the state the iuc of each irrigator and their final extracted volume thus each year ougcs request meter readings from each irrigators for each extraction point reporting occurs through phone calls email or paper forms although most ougcs are developing internet platforms and mobile applications to report information electronically some ougcs e g 22 are developing telemetry reporting technology regarding compliance the state remains responsible for imposing sanctions ougcs have been reluctant to implement their own penalties due to legal uncertainties and lack of acceptability amongst their members most ougcs only implement sanctions on farmers failing to report water use information or refusing to pay the ougc membership fee since these prerogatives are clearly laid down in the 2006 water law some ougcs e g 12 22 apply penalties to farmers exceeding their annual allocation in the form of a reduced water allocation the following year although proposals for financial penalties for such non compliance issue also exist e g 49 5 assessment of the policy reform outcomes the devolution of allocation decisions to ougcs was intended to increase self compliance of the agricultural sector to extraction caps this paper set out to assess more than 10 years after the principle was enacted in law whether the paradigm shift has taken place has a collective approach within the agricultural community become a reality and have local actors exploited the considerable leeway offered to them by the law to develop solutions adapted to local specific characteristics has collective management improved environmental economic and social performance what are the remaining challenges 5 1 the emergence of collective action the implementation of the 2006 water law suffered relatively long delays and initial resistance to change many irrigators complained that the reform was imposed on users rather than emanating from them therefore questioning the legitimacy of the future ougcs however the results of our survey suggest that agricultural water users have finally appropriated the reform leading to 54 functioning ougcs established in all priority areas and beyond the creation of the ougcs has undeniably improved users knowledge on local water resources as well as the monitoring and reporting of water use this is arguably the first essential step towards self regulation ostrom 1990 despite the widespread feelings of private ownership that irrigators have regarding their iucs ougcs have played an important role in developing a sense of common ownership over the resource this is evidenced by the terminology adopted such as reference volume instead of entitlements and the emphasis given on the revocable nature of individual allocations this clearly provides more leverage and flexibility to ougcs for tackling over allocation and resource depletion issues than they would have with a system of more secure individual water use rights as evidenced by experiences with water users associations in other countries see rinaudo and donoso 2018 for a case in chile the benefits of having a collective permit for the bulk allocation managed by the ougc instead of individual extraction permits should not be underestimated thanks to the legal backing ougcs became the primary point of contact for any irrigator wanting to extract water legally at the same time the collective license formalises the notion that individual allocations arise from a shared and limited resource as holley and sinclair 2014 suggest a collective license can contribute to strengthen collective action as it creates institutional inter dependence between irrigators ougcs being in charge of the bulk allocation they have reinforced controls on how water is reallocated between farmers in order to optimise collective benefits our survey clearly shows that stakeholders involved in the establishment of ougcs have fully used the leeway that was offered to them by the legislator ougcs present a wide diversity of choices in terms of legal entity in charge boundaries internal governance allocation rules and compliance rules the feasibility of the reform was enhanced because local solutions could be developed to take into account local historical political institutional and agricultural specificities 5 2 environmental performance the success of the reform is less obvious from an environmental point of view and problems remain in a number of situations the first one is where environmental problems persist mainly because the sel was over estimated for many reasons ranging from insufficient scientific knowledge to political pressure exerted by farmers representatives arnaud 2020 the second situation is where users negotiated a delay in achieving sels by way of exemptions in the hope that offline storage reservoirs or inter basin transfers could be created see section 4 3 3 see also douez et al 2020 meanwhile current use remains at historical levels and resources are over exploited generating environmental problems the situation should theoretically improve when substitution resources are developed however their construction is hampered by financial constraints and an increasing opposition from various ngos and social groups an abrupt imposition of iucs is possible if the infrastructure is not built by the exemption deadline in 2021 in many cases nevertheless the establishment of ougcs addressed environmental problems in other ways because sel must take into account resource characteristics and groundwater surface interactions the creation of ougcs has reinforced farmers awareness of hydrological dynamics and the interconnectivity of surface and groundwater resources ougcs have crafted refined allocation rules that take into account these hydrological realities similarly ougcs have improved local knowledge on extraction points and the volumes and timing of extraction this more detailed understanding has enabled ougcs to take measures to reduce extraction from wells boreholes or pumping stations in rivers that have the highest environmental impacts on the aquatic environment thereby also benefiting farmers by reducing the likelihood of use restrictions ougcs have started to relocate these extraction points onto lower impact wells e g further away from the river stem or deeper more plentiful groundwater several ougcs have developed rules to improve real time management of extraction during the peak season section 4 3 4 improved monitoring and communication between users allow optimisation of the spatial and temporal patterns of extraction in order to minimise environmental problems and the induced risks of administrative use restrictions 5 3 economic and social performance assessing the economic and social impact of the reform is complex considering how little temporal hindsight we have and the lack of data on water use productivity however our observations still suggest that ougcs have paid significant attention to the issue of efficiency and equity when developing their rules in particular those dealing with short and long term reallocations while the economic literature often suggests than efficient reallocation can only occur through market mechanisms the french case suggests instead that users can take economic efficiency into account when making reallocation decisions for example by prioritising reallocation to higher value crops or those generating added value in the basin unlike market based reallocation users can integrate a range of additional criteria in their decisions local priorities for employment rural development and environmental targets thus internalising what economists consider as market externalities allocation rules also suggest that a broad range of distributive social justice dimensions were taken into account several design options explored by rinaudo et al 2016 have been adopted reflecting various local preferences by ougcs regarding the legitimacy of grandfathering merit equal opportunities and equal treatment between irrigators 5 4 remaining challenges the shift from an individual to a collective water allocation regime is a far reaching reform its implementation will take place over many more years during which ougcs will face several challenges a first challenge is related to procedural justice in rule definition and implementation although the state is theoretically the guarantor of the general interest and must ensure fair treatment of users within the ougc there is always a risk that powerful coalitions of farmers influence the design and implementation of rules in their favour rent seeking behaviours could appear within the collective organisation itself resulting in the long term appropriation of water by historical users the lack of effective reallocation rules and the establishment of entry barriers ultimately leading to unequal and inefficient water allocation to mitigate that risk transparency and robust monitoring is necessary skurray 2015 as well as building the right governance structures within the ougc to build social capital lópez gunn 2012 second while we can expect that collective water management approach will be successfully implemented in catchment and aquifer systems with high storage and buffer capacity the situation is likely to be more challenging in more reactive and unregulated systems where the available resource highly fluctuates highly during each season and over years this issue will be compounded by the application of the use it or loose it rule which will narrow the gap between average water extraction and the extraction caps hence potentially making catchments more vulnerable to droughts ougcs will thus have to design rules to manage drought periods possibly adapting iucs to climatic and resource conditions at the beginning of the season or defining iucs as shares rather than nominal volumes young 2014 the use of monthly or weekly use caps might be required as practiced in some ougcs already this will increase the complexity of existing allocation rules require more intensive water use monitoring and overall increase risks of user non compliance and conflicts within the users community the third challenge will consist in developing mechanisms to enforce ougcs rules one of the reasons the state was keen to devolve the responsibility of water allocation to users was to support the enforcement of extraction caps an issue which has been clearly pointed out as a problem in france montginoul et al 2020 however with no backing from the legal framework most ougcs are reluctant to take over the responsibility for sanctioning non complying users hence the majority of ougcs consider that it should remain in the hands of the state in that context ougcs should be more clearly empowered with compliance roles in the same fashion as spanish water user associations lópez gunn and cortina 2006 or californian groundwater sustainability agencies kiparsky et al 2017 new enforcement mechanisms should also be explored see figureau et al 2015 still the success of the reform will depend on the capacity of the state to represent a credible threat to local users and step in when collective management fails holley and sinclair 2014 molle and closas 2020a 6 conclusion the paper explored the scope for user based allocations when the goal is to increase environmental sustainability it focused on a reform that promotes the shift from an individual to a collective water allocation regime one of the interesting characteristics of this reform imposed by the state lies in the fact that users had significant leeway to adapt its implementation locally this may explain why user groups were able to design a variety of allocation rules taking into account user needs and local priorities while at the same time considering water resource characteristics although implementation challenges remain the ougc system increases transparency on who benefits from water use and reinforces the notion that water is a common property it provides new opportunities to share water more equitably while supporting strategic choices on crop productions and associated value chains the french model of collective management of water allocations thus offers a fresh but valuable approach to improve the regulation of

10573,reclaiming saline soils at the edge of yinchuan plain is of paramount importance for ecological conservation therefore efficiency of drip irrigation method was evaluated in a field experiment the experiment using drip irrigation as reclamation method was carried out that included five soil matric potentials smps controlled at 5 10 15 20 and 25 kpa treatments s1 s5 respectively directly under drip emitters at 20 cm depth measures including vegetation collocation high raised ridge and three stage drip irrigation scheduling were adopted results showed that smp thresholds significantly affected the spatial distributions of both electrical conductivity ece and sodium adsorption ratio sare based on extracts of saturated paste the low salinity and sare zones either kept enlarging or remained stable when smp thresholds were above 20 kpa however for treatment s5 25 kpa these gradually shrank with time by the end of the second year the average ece values in treatments s1 s5 were 2 05 2 59 3 36 3 05 and 3 9 ds m 1 respectively indicating that ece increased linearly as smp threshold decreased the sare showed the same trend with corresponding values of 9 56 10 48 12 26 12 82 and 15 23 mmol l 1 0 5 the ph of the saturated soil extract phe in all treatments increased from 7 64 to around 8 00 and was not significantly affected by treatments moreover the two year survival rates of the dominant trees were 87 5 when smp threshold was above 20 kpa the growth indexes of plants reduced with the decrease in smp thresholds and statistical analysis suggested that 20 to 17 kpa was an important smp range below which the forage yield of the herbaceous legume astragalus adsurgens dropped sharply this study suggested the smp threshold of 20 kpa was important for drip irrigation scheduling and the drip irrigation combined with ridging plantation was efficient for both vegetation reclamation and reclaiming saline soils in these saline areas with shallow ground water keywords ecological conservation system drip irrigation saline soil reclamation 1 introduction the yinchuan plain is along both sides of the yellow river in the central ningxia hui autonomous region in the northwest of china the climate is extremely arid with annual average rainfall of 200 mm and potential evaporation of 2000 mm xiong et al 1996 benefiting from the abundant irrigation water resources of the yellow river the yinchuan plain has been one of the most important regions for cereal crop production since the qin dynasty more than 2000 years ago ningxia 1992 wang et al 1993 in 1960s the irrigated farmland area increased to an unprecedented scale from 0 1 to 0 2 million hectares with rapid development of the large scale water conservancy project excessive use of flood irrigation on these farmlands raised the water table and the total salt contents in marginal low lying areas wang et al 1993 under the extremely arid conditions large amount of salts has accumulated near the soil surface due to capillary action only a few salt tolerant plant species such as suaeda glauca bunge and tamarix chinensis lour were able to grow in these areas and it was extremely hard to establish vegetation due to severe soil salinity the shallow saline water table and poor drainage conditions furthermore productive sites between the yinchuan plain and the tengger desert are threatened by both salinization and potential desertification therefore an ecological conservation system is urgently needed to prevent further soil deterioration in this area artificial afforestation is effective to improve soil salinity and resist desert dust due to its abilities to improve the soil environment regulate the microclimate enhance ecological balance and increase economic benefits kürsten et al 2001 franco et al 2003 zhang 2009 afforestation in saline soil has a long history with common reclamation methods which include replacing saline soil with non saline soil leaching soil salt by the combination of irrigation and embedded drainage and adding chemicals like gypsum on the soil surface wang et al 1993 li 2011 yildiz et al 2017 these methods can remarkably improve amelioration of saline soils however reclamation costs are too high if above mentioned methods are implemented sun et al 2012 chen et al 2015a moreover large amounts of fresh water and good drainage conditions are required to leach salt which limits their use with the poor drainage in low lying areas of the yinchuan plain kang et al 2012a thus an efficient reclamation method under shallow water table and poor drainage conditions is needed for afforestation in this region drip irrigation has lots of advantages such as supplying sustainable water leaching salt protecting soil structure and not requiring large drainage facilities kang 1998 and therefore it is being used to ameliorate saline soil it supplies water precisely and uniformly at high frequencies and maintains high soil matric potential smp in the root zone thus constant high total water potential can be maintained for crop and plant growth owing to the high smp compensating for the low osmotic potential goldberg et al 1976 kang 1998 installing a tensiometer at a depth of 0 2 m exactly under drip emitters to monitor smp for most crops and shallow rooted perennials is an efficient method to schedule drip irrigation kang 2004 kang et al 2004 2012a remarkable results have been achieved using this method in rapid revegetation in many kinds of salt affected soils in the yinchuan plain northwest china zhang et al 2013 used a ridge sand niches drip irrigation pattern to reclaim takyric solonetz soil of which the saturated water conductivity was near zero they found that the zones with less of salinity and ph expanded year by year and better survival and higher fruit yields of lycium barbarum l were obtained when smp thresholds were controlled within 20 to 15 kpa in the songnen plain northeast china when smp was controlled at 10 to 5 kpa for restoration of grassland in a saline sodic area the salts were more leached and the grass coverage rate exceeded 60 after two years liu et al 2011 chen et al 2015a and li et al 2015b proposed phased irrigation methods of fresh water and saline water drip irrigation for construction of landscape vegetation respectively based on controlling different smp thresholds at different reclamation stages in east china they divided irrigation into four stages enhanced leaching stage ⅰ conventional salt leaching stage ⅱ precise water and salt regulation stage ⅲ and rain fed deficit irrigation stage ⅳ they suggested 20 kpa for fresh water irrigation and 10 kpa for saline water irrigation as key smp thresholds in stage iii for urban landscape vegetation rehabilitation around bohai bay east china there have been achievements in revegetation using drip irrigation in the last decade and a technical system constructed for revegetation in saline alkali land based on water and salt regulation methods and appropriate agronomic measures however the key smp thresholds for water and salt regulation are quite different for the diversities of climate plant species groundwater dynamics and soil texture conditions therefore proposing a drip irrigation scheduling and determining the crucial smp threshold in this region under shallow groundwater conditions has become imperative for both construction of an ecological conservation system and maintaining productive farm land in this region the objects of this study are to 1 clearly understand the soil salt spatial distribution in ridges over 2 years 2 reveal the responses of vegetation to smp thresholds and 3 determine the crucial smp threshold and propose a reclamation method for construction of an ecological conservation system suitable for the area this study provides a scientific basis and technical support for ecological defenses in this region or similar regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment was conducted at qingtongxia experimental station for ecological restoration of saline alkali soil in northwest china institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research chinese academy of sciences during 2015 and 2016 the station is in wuzhong county ningxia hui autonomous region china 38 1 43 38 1 48 n 105 56 29 105 56 36 e and is a part of the edge of the yellow river irrigation district on the yinchuan plain this area is inland in northwest china with a temperate continental semi arid climate the annual average temperature is 9 3 c with the lowest and highest of 23 7 c and 36 7 c respectively the rainfall is 260 mm per annum which is relatively low compared with annual average potential evaporation of 2000 mm the rainfall and potential evaporation measured by φ20 cm pan during growing seasons of 2015 and 2016 are shown in fig 1 the weather conditions of the two growing seasons were similar after august the potential evaporation was reduced to about 5 mm per day which was only half of that before august more than 70 of precipitation was distributed between july and september and the most single events were 10 mm the average groundwater depth of the experimental site was 1 2 m with electrical conductivity ec of 20 ds m 1 and ph of 8 5 the physical and chemical properties of tested soil were shown in table 1 irrigation water with ec of 0 86 ds m 1 ph of 7 95 and sar of 1 98 mmol l 1 0 5 table 2 was pumped from a conveyance canal connecting to the yellow river 2 2 experimental design five smp treatments s1 s5 were set up with smp thresholds controlled at 5 10 15 20 and 25 kpa respectively exactly under drip emitters at both 0 2 and 0 5 m which were the same as the experiment conducted by wang et al 2012a in northwest china each treatment consisted of three replications with 15 experimental plots in total in a complete random arrangement a set of smp monitors consisting of two tensiometers were buried exactly under drip emitters at 0 2 and 0 5 m wrapped up by non saline loamy soil paste fig 2 a to make sure the probes is in firm contact with the soil in each treatment when the smp monitored by a tensiometer declined to the chosen smp threshold irrigation was conducted in that treatment each treatment had an independent irrigation controller that included water meter pressure gauge mesh filter and fertilizer device controlling three repeating plots there were 16 drip tapes on ridges and four drip tapes in furrows in every experimental plot with an area of 16 m 12 m drip tubes with emitters discharge rate of 1 38 l h 1 at 10 m water head spaced 0 3 m apart were placed at an interval of 0 6 m on each ridge fig 2b the discharge rate and spatial density of emitters was selected in terms of infiltration experiment in field as proposed by chen et al 2015b 2 3 agronomic practices the initial soil was ridged at 0 8 m high by excavator at intervals of 4 m each plot had four 12 m long ridges and all trees shrubs and grass were planted on ridges fig 2a the trees poplar populus canadensis moench were planted in the transplanting holes dug in the middle of ridge with initial root zone soils at a space of 3 m the shrubs amorpha amorpha fruticosa linn golden elm ulmus pumila cv jinye wild peach amygdalus davidiana carr c de vos ex henry wild apricot armeniaca sibirica l lam and euonymus maackii euonymus maackii rupr were transplanted in z style with poplar at a space of 1 5 m on two sides of one single ridge fig 2b the four pairs of shrub rows in each plot were arranged as amorpha wild peach euonymus maackii wild apricot golden elm euonymus maackii and wild apricot golden elm the herbaceous legume astragalus adsurgens astragalus adsurgens pall was sown in five rows on each ridge fig 2a all plants were placed at a lateral separation of 0 1 m from drip tapes 2 4 irrigation management irrigation scheduling was divided to three stages stage i enhanced leaching started immediately after transplantation of vegetation in all treatments and the water head of drip irrigation system was controlled at 2 5 m about half discharge rate of that designed to reduce runoff caused by poor infiltration of saline soil the purpose of this stage was to leach salt in 0 10 cm soil layer as soon as possible to prevent the salt from the soil surface moving into the plant hole via runoff caused by rain or irrigation a few days would be taken to achieve this goal based on previous study chen et al 2015a li et al 2016 stage ii conventional leaching started after stage i terminated the infiltration rate would be improved as a result of salt leaching in stage i so water head was adjusted to the designed 10 m during this stage all treatments received 10 mm water if two of 10 smps fell below 5 kpa the amount of 10 mm water for single irrigation was more than 6 mm adopted for semi humid areas by chen et al 2015a and li et al 2015a stage ii ended when all transplanted plants were well established which lasted for 45 days stage iii precise water and salt regulation was carried out as soon as stage ii was over the five treatments were irrigated by matched irrigation controllers based on smp values once smp values of 0 2 or 0 5 m depths reduced to the smp threshold 10 mm of water was applied to that treatment if smp values were still lower than 10 kpa after one irrigation another 10 mm of water was supplied in the first irrigation early may spring irrigation and last irrigation early november winter irrigation of one growing season the water irrigation depth for all treatments was increased from the normal depth of 10 mm to at least 40 mm according to soil water and salt conditions urea 44 nitrogen and potassium dihydrogen phosphate 54 phosphate and 32 potassium were applied by a pressure differential fertilizer injection unit which powered by the pressure difference between the front and back ends of a regulation valve in sub main pipe the annual amounts of urea and potassium dihydrogen phosphate were 73 and 59 kg ha 1 respectively 2 5 observation and methods 2 5 1 smp the smp values monitored by tensiometers of all treatments were read twice daily at 8 00 and 15 00 2 5 2 soil chemical properties soil samples were taken from each plot with an auger 4 cm diameter and 10 cm high before vegetation was established 27 may 2015 after irrigation

october 2016 because the four drip tapes on one ridge were placed at the same lateral interval there was no need to sample soils from all the area affected by the four drip tapes thus soil samples were only taken from an area affected by a single drip tape fig 2c the samples were taken 30 20 10 0 10 30 50 70 80 95 and 110 cm away from the emitters the negative values mean the direction towards middle ridge and the positive values mean the direction towards furrow as showed in fig 2c and the sampling depth intervals were at 10 cm 0 40 cm soil layer and 20 cm 40 120 cm soil layer fig 2c all soil samples were air dried and sieved through a 2 mm sieve three replicate samples were mixed to one sample to make an extract of saturated soil paste by standard method robbins and wiegand 1990 the ece and phe were determined by a conductivity meter dds 11a yulong shanghai china and a ph meter phs 3c yulong respectively the na k and ca2 were measured by icp oes inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer optima 5300dv perkinelmer shelton ct usa using the extract of saturated soil paste sare was calculated as follows 1 sare n a k c a 2 0 5 where the concentration of each cation is

growing seasons of both 2015 and 2016 growth indexes of poplar trees were measured height h ground diameter gd diameter at breast height dbh and crown diameter cd the coverage rate of ridges was measured by handheld plant canopy spectrometer acs 430 holland scientific lincoln ne usa astragalus adsurgens was harvested twice in the growing season of 2016 and one random ridge of astragalus adsurgens of each plot was weighed to estimate yield of every treatment the water content of astragalus adsurgens was measured by drying at 105 c to estimate the amount of dry matter 2 5 4 data analysis because the soil sampling vertical interval and sampling area were not uniform it was necessary to divide the sampling area into three parts rectangle in ridge a1 trapezoid in slope a2 and rectangle in furrow a3 respectively fig 2c the average ece of the whole profile fig 2c was calculated by weighted average method taking both the vertical distance and area as weighting factors 2 ece i

whole profile were calculated in the same way the growth characteristics of plants were calculated as relative values and they were the ratio of the growth characteristics of the s1 s2 s3 s4 and s5 treatments to these of the s1 treatment the root zone was defined as the 0 4 m 0 4 m 0 4 m soil cube around the plant the average ece in root zones was calculated as an arithmetic mean 2 5 5 statistical analysis data were analyzed using ibm spss statistics ver 19 0 ibm co armonk ny usa differences in phe sare and growth indexes among time periods respectively were compared by one way anova time and smp treatments as two factors and their interaction were tested by general linear model method of two way anova to evaluate their effects on ece phe and sare respectively 3 results 3 1 irrigation and smp applied irrigation amounts are shown in table 3 and the same amounts were applied in different treatments in stage i and stage ii with that of 88 and 355 mm respectively during stage iii the irrigation water for s1 s5 reduced with the decrease of smp thresholds in both 2015 and 2016 compared to s1 the total amount of irrigation water for s2 s5 treatments was 85 7 79 0 76 8 and 73 6 in 2015 respectively and correspondingly 72 6 55 7 54 0 and 41 5 in 2016 changes of daily smps for different treatments for a clearer expression only s1 s3 and s5 treatments are displayed at depths of both 20 and 50 cm in the growing seasons of 2015 and 2016 were shown in fig 3 the smp values in all treatments in irrigation stage ⅱ before 2015 7 22 were basically stable between 10 and 5 kpa as a result of uniform irrigation in this stage the changes of smps at depth 20 cm in stage ⅲ in 2015 after 2015 7 22 and in 2016 fig 3b showed that smp values of all treatments fluctuated around their thresholds as affected by smp threshold controlling for irrigation furthermore smp values in all treatments increased to higher than their thresholds when heavy or continuous rain happened fig 1 but during most of the time without rainfalls the smp values in different treatments were controlled well around their thresholds compared with 20 cm the smp at 50 cm was stable basically changing within smp thresholds fig 3c and d 3 2 spatial and temporal dynamics of ece phe and sare 3 2 1 ece the spatial changes of ece in soil sampling profiles at different time periods are shown in fig 4 the initial ece values were generally above 8 ds m 1 with weighted average of 10 4 ds m 1 fig 4a indicating a highly saline soil bao 2000 after stage i and 10 days of conventional leaching the ece indicated that the low salinity zone ece 4 ds m 1 had enlarged to 60 cm depth fig 4b the average ece in the whole profile was 7 6 ds m 1 reducing by 27 5 as compared to the initial value at the end of the stage ii fig 4c the low salinity zone extended dramatically to 100 cm depth with 70 9 salt decrease relative to initial ece the spatial distributions of ece of different treatments in stage iii are shown in fig 4d f there were notable differences of ece distribution in different treatments at the end of 2015 fig 4d compared with ece values at the end of stage ii fig 4c the salt of s1 and s2 was leached to a lower range s3 remained almost unchanged in the whole profile however s4 and s5 had increased obviously ece of s4 had increased more significantly than s5 which was incongruent with the irrigation and smp conditions of the two treatments it may be explained by soil heterogeneity in the local area where soil samples were collected after irrigation cessation and freezing thawing events for a whole winter and spring the ece values fig 4e at the bottom of profiles had increased by small degrees compared to those at the end of 2015 by the end of the second growing season the low salinity zones had reduced as the smp thresholds decreased fig 4f low salinity zones in s1 s4 were controlled at 80 cm or deeper but that in s5 moved upwards to 40 cm depth the ece was affected by time and treatments fig 4 time and smp treatments as two factors and their interaction were tested for their effects on ece table 4 results showed time smp and their interaction had extremely significant effects on ece p 0 01 the average ece values of all treatments changed with time fig 5 when irrigation stage i terminated after 10 days 13 june 2015 fig 5 the soil salinity changed from moderate to mild range according to classification of bao 2000 the average ece values from the end of growing season in 2015 to the end of 2016 fig 5 indicated that salinity values in treatments s1 s4 remained stable but that in treatment s5 had a trend of increase with a risk of becoming again mildly saline soil this result coincided with the spatial distributions of s5 fig 4 based on ece data of three time periods there was a remarkable linear relationship between ece in root zones and smp threshold fig 6 a but a weak linear relationship between ece in the whole profiles 0 120 cm and smp threshold fig 6b 3 2 2 phe before the experiment was conducted the phe in the top soil layer was higher than that in deeper soil supplementary fig 1 and the average value was 7 64 after reclamation for one growing season the phe substantially increased with s1 s5 gaining 0 44 0 53 0 21 0 51 and 0 43 respectively compared with the initial values however no significant differences were found among treatments table 4 at the end of 2016 the phe showed no further increase compared to the previous stage with average values of 8 13 8 03 7 99 8 10 and 8 04 for s1 s5 respectively from the time perspective the phe values at the end of 2015 and 2016 were significantly higher than those before the experiment at p 0 05 table 5 as a result of salt leaching 3 2 3 sare the initial sare increased with soil depth and the value was generally above 12 mmol l 1 0 5 supplementary fig 2a after one growing season there were great decreases in all treatments supplementary fig 2b the average sare values for s1 s5 treatments were 8 3 5 7 18 1 19 0 and 9 1 mmol l 1 0 5 table 6 respectively the whole soil layers of both s1 and s2 became non alkaline where sare was below 13 mmol l 1 0 5 james et al 1982 chhabra 2004 with reductions of 67 2 and 77 6 respectively the non alkaline zone for s3 s5 treatments only reached to 80 cm depth after the second growing season the average sare for s1 s5 treatments was 9 6 10 5 12 3 12 8 and 15 2 mmol l 1 0 5 table 6 respectively showing a linear relationship between sare and smp threshold as found for ece vs smp threshold from the time perspective the average sare values in s1 s4 had significant reduction trend year by year table 6 while in s5 it decreased significantly in the first season but increased significantly in the second season maintaining the smp higher than 20 kpa could guarantee a reliable reduction trend for sare in the 0 120 cm soil layer 3 3 plant responses 3 3 1 survival rates of plants the survival rate sr in the first year differed between plant species as shown in supplementary table 1 the best srs were the species of amorpha and poplar all with srs 90 followed by golden elm with sr 80 and then by wild peach wild apricot and euonymus maackii with srs 80 the sr of plants in the second year was comparable to sr in the first year suggesting that only some plants died in the second year and that plants srs in different treatments remained stable for the 2 years keeping the smp threshold above 20 kpa could guarantee the srs of the three dominant plants poplar amorpha and golden elm being 87 5 3 3 2 plant growth 3 3 2 1 poplar the increments of four growth indexes h gd dbh and cd for poplar in all treatments at the end of growing seasons of 2015 and 2016 are shown in table 7 although no significant differences were found within treatments for h dbh and cd in the 2015 growing season the gd in s1 was significantly higher than other treatments in the second growing season the growing increments of poplar had increased almost 10 times compared to the first season there were remarkable differences for all growth indexes between treatments at the end of 2016 the highest growth was for treatment s1 with increments of 244 1 cm 41 7 mm 21 7 mm and 169 6 cm for h gd dbh and cd respectively the minimum growth was for s5 with corresponding increments of 92 9 cm 11 5 mm 4 0 mm and 79 8 cm which were only about 30 of s1 the average relative growth rates rgrs of the four growing indexes reduced linearly as smp threshold decreased fig 7 a the linear regression equation revealed that rgr decreased by 3 4 for every 1 kpa decrease when below 5 kpa interestingly the 50 rgr line intersected the regression line at the point with abscissa of s4 20 kpa thus 20 kpa would be a key smp threshold of the half growth increment for poplar 3 3 2 2 astragalus adsurgens the relative coverage rate rcr of astragalus adsurgens decreased linearly with smp threshold decreasing fig 7a similar to that of poplar the correlation between the relative dry matter product rdmr of astragalus adsurgens and smp thresholds showed a different pattern there was a turning point at 20 kpa fig 7b and the trend of rdmr with smp was depicted by two regression lines with different slopes the slope was 1 37 for smp threshold above 17 kpa and slope increased to 2 86 for smp threshold below 17 kpa this indicated that the rdmp had a much greater decrease when smp was controlled below 17 kpa than when above 17 kpa the smp thresholds between 17 and 20 kpa could be an important range for production of astragalus adsurgens 4 discussion 4 1 the smp threshold controls the leaching fraction and soil salinity the total applied irrigation water of different treatment decreased as smp thresholds decreasing table 2 in stage ⅲ which was in accordance with other studies wan et al 2012 chen et al 2015a in fact the smp thresholds also determined the leaching fraction lf kang et al 2012b and wang et al 2012b found that the leaching water amounts for cotton cultivation under precise drip irrigation schedule decreased as smp threshold decreasing during single growing season in an arid area their studies indicated that the deep percolation amounts at 100 cm depth were about 18 14 9 6 and 4 mm when smp threshold controlled at 5 10 15 20 and 25 kpa respectively though leaching water amounts in this study was not measured the lf could be estimated based on the empirical curve that revealed the relationship between lf and the ratio of anticipated soil salinity crop tolerance to irrigation water salinity under high frequency irrigation as showed in supplementary fig 3 scs 1992 the average ece values within rootzones in different treatments fig 6b indicated that soil salinity kept stable in the stage ⅲ in both 2015 and 2016 and the average ece values within rootzones were 0 85 1 45 1 89 2 09 and 2 57 ds m in treatments s1 s5 respectively these stable ece values within rootzones in the stage ⅲ could be interpreted as the anticipated soil salinity or virtual crop tolerance under certain irrigation schedule then the ratios of these values to irrigation water salinity 0 86 ds m were 1 0 1 7 2 2 2 4 and 3 0 in treatments s1 s5 respectively based on the empirical curve for high frequency irrigation curve 2 in supplementary fig 3 the lfs in treatments s1 s5 were 0 20 0 040 0 019 0 015 and 0 010 the leaching amounts in s1 s5 treatments calculated by the total irrigation amount table 3 and rainfall fig 1 were 189 3 29 1 11 2 8 6 and 4 8 mm respectively in 2016 growing season the estimated leaching amounts in s1 and s2 were much higher than that in the studies of kang et al 2012b and wang et al 2012b which might attribute to the shallow rootzones 40 cm depth in this study the average ece increased linearly as smp threshold decreased in top soils within 40 cm in this study and the same results were found by wang et al 2014 and chen et al 2015a the calculated leaching amounts played important role in salt leaching thus the soil salinity within in rootzones increased as leaching amounts decreasing however the linear relationship between ece in the whole soil profiles 0 120 cm and smp was not significant which differed from the result of chen et al 2015a in their study the ece in the whole soil profiles increased sharply as smp threshold decreased but the low leaching amounts in s3 s4 and s5 11 2 8 6 and 4 8 mm respectively in this study might had weak leaching effect on deep soil salt thus the salinity of the whole soil profile was not linearly correlated to the smp thresholds significantly another possible reason was that a filter barrier was laid above water table in the area of chen et al 2015a which reduced the capillarity of groundwater as compared the author s study area was directly exposed to groundwater so the salinity of the whole soil profile was also affected by groundwater dynamics 4 2 prospects of using drip irrigation for afforestation and saline soil reclamation the soil improvement materials such as gypsum and drainage practices were traditionally engaged in afforestation in saline area yildiz et al 2017 conducted an afforestation restoration experiment in an arid region in central asia in which they adopted gypsum and sulfur combined with irrigation and drainage to reclaim saline soil they found the soil infiltration rate increased significantly when 900 mm water was applied after gypsum and sulfur were added into soil and the survival rates of salt tolerant trees were higher than 80 while that of poplar was only 36 in this study the total applied water amount in 2015 and 2016 under recommended irrigation schedule stage ⅰ stage ⅱ and 20 kpa in stage ⅲ was 987 mm table 3 which was similar to that of yildiz et al but the survival rate of poplar in this study was much higher and high to 87 5 gou et al 2017 conducted an experiment aiming at constructing a willow forest with the help of the combination of flood irrigation and embedded drainage ditches in a semi arid saline area in northwest china they found the ditches arranged at 9 m intervals in field was efficient to leach salt and ensure the establishment of the willow forest when 1800 mm water was applied yearly their study area was the same as the author s where suffered from the high water table and heavy salinity the yearly 1800 mm water would raise the water table in the long run unless the forced drainage was applied as compared the yearly applied water under smp scheduled drip irrigation in this study was only one third of that of flood irrigation and the deep percolation was less than 10 mm if the irrigation was triggered at the smp threshold of 20 kpa thus it had little influence on water table in addition about 1200 mm available water was saved yearly under this irrigation schedule when compared with flood irrigation moreover the smp threshold played a very important role in vegetation restoration by using drip irrigation in different climate regions liu et al 2011 reported a smp threshold of 10 kpa was crucial for salt leaching and pasture restoration in soda alkali saline soil in the songnen plain with semi humid climate northeast china li et al 2015b reported a smp above 5 kpa at 20 cm depth under the emitter in the first year and 10 kpa in the second year and 6 mm of irrigation water can be used as an indicator for rose drip irrigation scheduling when irrigating with saline water at 4 01 ds m in initially saline soils with a gravel sand layer after tillage in the bohai gulf with semi humid monsoon climate east china plessis 1985 reported that the low frequency irrigation that smp threshold controlled around 40 kpa for citrus cultivation could reduce soil salt and increase leaching water when adopting weighing lysimeters to determine irrigation quota in south africa with tropical savanna climate the drip irrigation scheduled by smp threshold showed great application potential for its advantages of saving water reducing deep percolation maintaining high survival rates and adapting to different climates when engaged in vegetation restoration in saline area however the amount of winter irrigation that kept salt out of the rootzones in non irrigation seasons winter and early spring under drip irrigation was basic determined by experiences and the critical buried depth of saline groundwater that safe to perennial trees was still unknown all these questions needed to be studied in the near future 5 conclusion the drip irrigation schedule had a dominant influence on salt distribution during the uniform irrigation stages i and ii salt was leached quickly and the desalination rate was 70 87 by the end of stage ii this rate became slower and was correlated to the smp threshold in stage iii the ece and sare increased as smp thresholds decreased and the low salinity and sare zones either kept enlarging or remained stable when smp thresholds were above 20 kpa the phe in all treatments increased with time and remained stable around 8 0 but there were no significant differences among treatments the 2 year srs of plants were stable compared with initial srs the prs of poplar amorpha and golden elm were all 87 5 when smp threshold remained above 20 kpa plant growth reduced with smp thresholds decreasing and with the smp threshold of 20 kpa being a turning point for plant growth under these conditions this study indicated that the three stage drip irrigation ridge vegetation collocation was an efficient method to establish an ecological conservation system in a low lying saline area the smp threshold of 20 kpa was a pivotal value for water and salt regulation in stage iii a three stage drip irrigation schedule could be recommended stage i keeping drip irrigation for a few continuous days until the salt in 0 10 cm soil layer is leached stage ii irrigation controlled at 5 kpa smp threshold at depth of 20 cm and 50 cm for at least 45 days and stage iii irrigation controlled at 20 kpa smp threshold thereafter acknowledgements this study was supported by the national key research and development program of china grant nos 2016yfc0501304 and

10573,reclaiming saline soils at the edge of yinchuan plain is of paramount importance for ecological conservation therefore efficiency of drip irrigation method was evaluated in a field experiment the experiment using drip irrigation as reclamation method was carried out that included five soil matric potentials smps controlled at 5 10 15 20 and 25 kpa treatments s1 s5 respectively directly under drip emitters at 20 cm depth measures including vegetation collocation high raised ridge and three stage drip irrigation scheduling were adopted results showed that smp thresholds significantly affected the spatial distributions of both electrical conductivity ece and sodium adsorption ratio sare based on extracts of saturated paste the low salinity and sare zones either kept enlarging or remained stable when smp thresholds were above 20 kpa however for treatment s5 25 kpa these gradually shrank with time by the end of the second year the average ece values in treatments s1 s5 were 2 05 2 59 3 36 3 05 and 3 9 ds m 1 respectively indicating that ece increased linearly as smp threshold decreased the sare showed the same trend with corresponding values of 9 56 10 48 12 26 12 82 and 15 23 mmol l 1 0 5 the ph of the saturated soil extract phe in all treatments increased from 7 64 to around 8 00 and was not significantly affected by treatments moreover the two year survival rates of the dominant trees were 87 5 when smp threshold was above 20 kpa the growth indexes of plants reduced with the decrease in smp thresholds and statistical analysis suggested that 20 to 17 kpa was an important smp range below which the forage yield of the herbaceous legume astragalus adsurgens dropped sharply this study suggested the smp threshold of 20 kpa was important for drip irrigation scheduling and the drip irrigation combined with ridging plantation was efficient for both vegetation reclamation and reclaiming saline soils in these saline areas with shallow ground water keywords ecological conservation system drip irrigation saline soil reclamation 1 introduction the yinchuan plain is along both sides of the yellow river in the central ningxia hui autonomous region in the northwest of china the climate is extremely arid with annual average rainfall of 200 mm and potential evaporation of 2000 mm xiong et al 1996 benefiting from the abundant irrigation water resources of the yellow river the yinchuan plain has been one of the most important regions for cereal crop production since the qin dynasty more than 2000 years ago ningxia 1992 wang et al 1993 in 1960s the irrigated farmland area increased to an unprecedented scale from 0 1 to 0 2 million hectares with rapid development of the large scale water conservancy project excessive use of flood irrigation on these farmlands raised the water table and the total salt contents in marginal low lying areas wang et al 1993 under the extremely arid conditions large amount of salts has accumulated near the soil surface due to capillary action only a few salt tolerant plant species such as suaeda glauca bunge and tamarix chinensis lour were able to grow in these areas and it was extremely hard to establish vegetation due to severe soil salinity the shallow saline water table and poor drainage conditions furthermore productive sites between the yinchuan plain and the tengger desert are threatened by both salinization and potential desertification therefore an ecological conservation system is urgently needed to prevent further soil deterioration in this area artificial afforestation is effective to improve soil salinity and resist desert dust due to its abilities to improve the soil environment regulate the microclimate enhance ecological balance and increase economic benefits kürsten et al 2001 franco et al 2003 zhang 2009 afforestation in saline soil has a long history with common reclamation methods which include replacing saline soil with non saline soil leaching soil salt by the combination of irrigation and embedded drainage and adding chemicals like gypsum on the soil surface wang et al 1993 li 2011 yildiz et al 2017 these methods can remarkably improve amelioration of saline soils however reclamation costs are too high if above mentioned methods are implemented sun et al 2012 chen et al 2015a moreover large amounts of fresh water and good drainage conditions are required to leach salt which limits their use with the poor drainage in low lying areas of the yinchuan plain kang et al 2012a thus an efficient reclamation method under shallow water table and poor drainage conditions is needed for afforestation in this region drip irrigation has lots of advantages such as supplying sustainable water leaching salt protecting soil structure and not requiring large drainage facilities kang 1998 and therefore it is being used to ameliorate saline soil it supplies water precisely and uniformly at high frequencies and maintains high soil matric potential smp in the root zone thus constant high total water potential can be maintained for crop and plant growth owing to the high smp compensating for the low osmotic potential goldberg et al 1976 kang 1998 installing a tensiometer at a depth of 0 2 m exactly under drip emitters to monitor smp for most crops and shallow rooted perennials is an efficient method to schedule drip irrigation kang 2004 kang et al 2004 2012a remarkable results have been achieved using this method in rapid revegetation in many kinds of salt affected soils in the yinchuan plain northwest china zhang et al 2013 used a ridge sand niches drip irrigation pattern to reclaim takyric solonetz soil of which the saturated water conductivity was near zero they found that the zones with less of salinity and ph expanded year by year and better survival and higher fruit yields of lycium barbarum l were obtained when smp thresholds were controlled within 20 to 15 kpa in the songnen plain northeast china when smp was controlled at 10 to 5 kpa for restoration of grassland in a saline sodic area the salts were more leached and the grass coverage rate exceeded 60 after two years liu et al 2011 chen et al 2015a and li et al 2015b proposed phased irrigation methods of fresh water and saline water drip irrigation for construction of landscape vegetation respectively based on controlling different smp thresholds at different reclamation stages in east china they divided irrigation into four stages enhanced leaching stage ⅰ conventional salt leaching stage ⅱ precise water and salt regulation stage ⅲ and rain fed deficit irrigation stage ⅳ they suggested 20 kpa for fresh water irrigation and 10 kpa for saline water irrigation as key smp thresholds in stage iii for urban landscape vegetation rehabilitation around bohai bay east china there have been achievements in revegetation using drip irrigation in the last decade and a technical system constructed for revegetation in saline alkali land based on water and salt regulation methods and appropriate agronomic measures however the key smp thresholds for water and salt regulation are quite different for the diversities of climate plant species groundwater dynamics and soil texture conditions therefore proposing a drip irrigation scheduling and determining the crucial smp threshold in this region under shallow groundwater conditions has become imperative for both construction of an ecological conservation system and maintaining productive farm land in this region the objects of this study are to 1 clearly understand the soil salt spatial distribution in ridges over 2 years 2 reveal the responses of vegetation to smp thresholds and 3 determine the crucial smp threshold and propose a reclamation method for construction of an ecological conservation system suitable for the area this study provides a scientific basis and technical support for ecological defenses in this region or similar regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment was conducted at qingtongxia experimental station for ecological restoration of saline alkali soil in northwest china institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research chinese academy of sciences during 2015 and 2016 the station is in wuzhong county ningxia hui autonomous region china 38 1 43 38 1 48 n 105 56 29 105 56 36 e and is a part of the edge of the yellow river irrigation district on the yinchuan plain this area is inland in northwest china with a temperate continental semi arid climate the annual average temperature is 9 3 c with the lowest and highest of 23 7 c and 36 7 c respectively the rainfall is 260 mm per annum which is relatively low compared with annual average potential evaporation of 2000 mm the rainfall and potential evaporation measured by φ20 cm pan during growing seasons of 2015 and 2016 are shown in fig 1 the weather conditions of the two growing seasons were similar after august the potential evaporation was reduced to about 5 mm per day which was only half of that before august more than 70 of precipitation was distributed between july and september and the most single events were 10 mm the average groundwater depth of the experimental site was 1 2 m with electrical conductivity ec of 20 ds m 1 and ph of 8 5 the physical and chemical properties of tested soil were shown in table 1 irrigation water with ec of 0 86 ds m 1 ph of 7 95 and sar of 1 98 mmol l 1 0 5 table 2 was pumped from a conveyance canal connecting to the yellow river 2 2 experimental design five smp treatments s1 s5 were set up with smp thresholds controlled at 5 10 15 20 and 25 kpa respectively exactly under drip emitters at both 0 2 and 0 5 m which were the same as the experiment conducted by wang et al 2012a in northwest china each treatment consisted of three replications with 15 experimental plots in total in a complete random arrangement a set of smp monitors consisting of two tensiometers were buried exactly under drip emitters at 0 2 and 0 5 m wrapped up by non saline loamy soil paste fig 2 a to make sure the probes is in firm contact with the soil in each treatment when the smp monitored by a tensiometer declined to the chosen smp threshold irrigation was conducted in that treatment each treatment had an independent irrigation controller that included water meter pressure gauge mesh filter and fertilizer device controlling three repeating plots there were 16 drip tapes on ridges and four drip tapes in furrows in every experimental plot with an area of 16 m 12 m drip tubes with emitters discharge rate of 1 38 l h 1 at 10 m water head spaced 0 3 m apart were placed at an interval of 0 6 m on each ridge fig 2b the discharge rate and spatial density of emitters was selected in terms of infiltration experiment in field as proposed by chen et al 2015b 2 3 agronomic practices the initial soil was ridged at 0 8 m high by excavator at intervals of 4 m each plot had four 12 m long ridges and all trees shrubs and grass were planted on ridges fig 2a the trees poplar populus canadensis moench were planted in the transplanting holes dug in the middle of ridge with initial root zone soils at a space of 3 m the shrubs amorpha amorpha fruticosa linn golden elm ulmus pumila cv jinye wild peach amygdalus davidiana carr c de vos ex henry wild apricot armeniaca sibirica l lam and euonymus maackii euonymus maackii rupr were transplanted in z style with poplar at a space of 1 5 m on two sides of one single ridge fig 2b the four pairs of shrub rows in each plot were arranged as amorpha wild peach euonymus maackii wild apricot golden elm euonymus maackii and wild apricot golden elm the herbaceous legume astragalus adsurgens astragalus adsurgens pall was sown in five rows on each ridge fig 2a all plants were placed at a lateral separation of 0 1 m from drip tapes 2 4 irrigation management irrigation scheduling was divided to three stages stage i enhanced leaching started immediately after transplantation of vegetation in all treatments and the water head of drip irrigation system was controlled at 2 5 m about half discharge rate of that designed to reduce runoff caused by poor infiltration of saline soil the purpose of this stage was to leach salt in 0 10 cm soil layer as soon as possible to prevent the salt from the soil surface moving into the plant hole via runoff caused by rain or irrigation a few days would be taken to achieve this goal based on previous study chen et al 2015a li et al 2016 stage ii conventional leaching started after stage i terminated the infiltration rate would be improved as a result of salt leaching in stage i so water head was adjusted to the designed 10 m during this stage all treatments received 10 mm water if two of 10 smps fell below 5 kpa the amount of 10 mm water for single irrigation was more than 6 mm adopted for semi humid areas by chen et al 2015a and li et al 2015a stage ii ended when all transplanted plants were well established which lasted for 45 days stage iii precise water and salt regulation was carried out as soon as stage ii was over the five treatments were irrigated by matched irrigation controllers based on smp values once smp values of 0 2 or 0 5 m depths reduced to the smp threshold 10 mm of water was applied to that treatment if smp values were still lower than 10 kpa after one irrigation another 10 mm of water was supplied in the first irrigation early may spring irrigation and last irrigation early november winter irrigation of one growing season the water irrigation depth for all treatments was increased from the normal depth of 10 mm to at least 40 mm according to soil water and salt conditions urea 44 nitrogen and potassium dihydrogen phosphate 54 phosphate and 32 potassium were applied by a pressure differential fertilizer injection unit which powered by the pressure difference between the front and back ends of a regulation valve in sub main pipe the annual amounts of urea and potassium dihydrogen phosphate were 73 and 59 kg ha 1 respectively 2 5 observation and methods 2 5 1 smp the smp values monitored by tensiometers of all treatments were read twice daily at 8 00 and 15 00 2 5 2 soil chemical properties soil samples were taken from each plot with an auger 4 cm diameter and 10 cm high before vegetation was established 27 may 2015 after irrigation

october 2016 because the four drip tapes on one ridge were placed at the same lateral interval there was no need to sample soils from all the area affected by the four drip tapes thus soil samples were only taken from an area affected by a single drip tape fig 2c the samples were taken 30 20 10 0 10 30 50 70 80 95 and 110 cm away from the emitters the negative values mean the direction towards middle ridge and the positive values mean the direction towards furrow as showed in fig 2c and the sampling depth intervals were at 10 cm 0 40 cm soil layer and 20 cm 40 120 cm soil layer fig 2c all soil samples were air dried and sieved through a 2 mm sieve three replicate samples were mixed to one sample to make an extract of saturated soil paste by standard method robbins and wiegand 1990 the ece and phe were determined by a conductivity meter dds 11a yulong shanghai china and a ph meter phs 3c yulong respectively the na k and ca2 were measured by icp oes inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer optima 5300dv perkinelmer shelton ct usa using the extract of saturated soil paste sare was calculated as follows 1 sare n a k c a 2 0 5 where the concentration of each cation is

growing seasons of both 2015 and 2016 growth indexes of poplar trees were measured height h ground diameter gd diameter at breast height dbh and crown diameter cd the coverage rate of ridges was measured by handheld plant canopy spectrometer acs 430 holland scientific lincoln ne usa astragalus adsurgens was harvested twice in the growing season of 2016 and one random ridge of astragalus adsurgens of each plot was weighed to estimate yield of every treatment the water content of astragalus adsurgens was measured by drying at 105 c to estimate the amount of dry matter 2 5 4 data analysis because the soil sampling vertical interval and sampling area were not uniform it was necessary to divide the sampling area into three parts rectangle in ridge a1 trapezoid in slope a2 and rectangle in furrow a3 respectively fig 2c the average ece of the whole profile fig 2c was calculated by weighted average method taking both the vertical distance and area as weighting factors 2 ece i

treatments to these of the s1 treatment the root zone was defined as the 0 4 m 0 4 m 0 4 m soil cube around the plant the average ece in root zones was calculated as an arithmetic mean 2 5 5 statistical analysis data were analyzed using ibm spss statistics ver 19 0 ibm co armonk ny usa differences in phe sare and growth indexes among time periods respectively were compared by one way anova time and smp treatments as two factors and their interaction were tested by general linear model method of two way anova to evaluate their effects on ece phe and sare respectively 3 results 3 1 irrigation and smp applied irrigation amounts are shown in table 3 and the same amounts were applied in different treatments in stage i and stage ii with that of 88 and 355 mm respectively during stage iii the irrigation water for s1 s5 reduced with the decrease of smp thresholds in both 2015 and 2016 compared to s1 the total amount of irrigation water for s2 s5 treatments was 85 7 79 0 76 8 and 73 6 in 2015 respectively and correspondingly 72 6 55 7 54 0 and 41 5 in 2016 changes of daily smps for different treatments for a clearer expression only s1 s3 and s5 treatments are displayed at depths of both 20 and 50 cm in the growing seasons of 2015 and 2016 were shown in fig 3 the smp values in all treatments in irrigation stage ⅱ before 2015 7 22 were basically stable between 10 and 5 kpa as a result of uniform irrigation in this stage the changes of smps at depth 20 cm in stage ⅲ in 2015 after 2015 7 22 and in 2016 fig 3b showed that smp values of all treatments fluctuated around their thresholds as affected by smp threshold controlling for irrigation furthermore smp values in all treatments increased to higher than their thresholds when heavy or continuous rain happened fig 1 but during most of the time without rainfalls the smp values in different treatments were controlled well around their thresholds compared with 20 cm the smp at 50 cm was stable basically changing within smp thresholds fig 3c and d 3 2 spatial and temporal dynamics of ece phe and sare 3 2 1 ece the spatial changes of ece in soil sampling profiles at different time periods are shown in fig 4 the initial ece values were generally above 8 ds m 1 with weighted average of 10 4 ds m 1 fig 4a indicating a highly saline soil bao 2000 after stage i and 10 days of conventional leaching the ece indicated that the low salinity zone ece 4 ds m 1 had enlarged to 60 cm depth fig 4b the average ece in the whole profile was 7 6 ds m 1 reducing by 27 5 as compared to the initial value at the end of the stage ii fig 4c the low salinity zone extended dramatically to 100 cm depth with 70 9 salt decrease relative to initial ece the spatial distributions of ece of different treatments in stage iii are shown in fig 4d f there were notable differences of ece distribution in different treatments at the end of 2015 fig 4d compared with ece values at the end of stage ii fig 4c the salt of s1 and s2 was leached to a lower range s3 remained almost unchanged in the whole profile however s4 and s5 had increased obviously ece of s4 had increased more significantly than s5 which was incongruent with the irrigation and smp conditions of the two treatments it may be explained by soil heterogeneity in the local area where soil samples were collected after irrigation cessation and freezing thawing events for a whole winter and spring the ece values fig 4e at the bottom of profiles had increased by small degrees compared to those at the end of 2015 by the end of the second growing season the low salinity zones had reduced as the smp thresholds decreased fig 4f low salinity zones in s1 s4 were controlled at 80 cm or deeper but that in s5 moved upwards to 40 cm depth the ece was affected by time and treatments fig 4 time and smp treatments as two factors and their interaction were tested for their effects on ece table 4 results showed time smp and their interaction had extremely significant effects on ece p 0 01 the average ece values of all treatments changed with time fig 5 when irrigation stage i terminated after 10 days 13 june 2015 fig 5 the soil salinity changed from moderate to mild range according to classification of bao 2000 the average ece values from the end of growing season in 2015 to the end of 2016 fig 5 indicated that salinity values in treatments s1 s4 remained stable but that in treatment s5 had a trend of increase with a risk of becoming again mildly saline soil this result coincided with the spatial distributions of s5 fig 4 based on ece data of three time periods there was a remarkable linear relationship between ece in root zones and smp threshold fig 6 a but a weak linear relationship between ece in the whole profiles 0 120 cm and smp threshold fig 6b 3 2 2 phe before the experiment was conducted the phe in the top soil layer was higher than that in deeper soil supplementary fig 1 and the average value was 7 64 after reclamation for one growing season the phe substantially increased with s1 s5 gaining 0 44 0 53 0 21 0 51 and 0 43 respectively compared with the initial values however no significant differences were found among treatments table 4 at the end of 2016 the phe showed no further increase compared to the previous stage with average values of 8 13 8 03 7 99 8 10 and 8 04 for s1 s5 respectively from the time perspective the phe values at the end of 2015 and 2016 were significantly higher than those before the experiment at p 0 05 table 5 as a result of salt leaching 3 2 3 sare the initial sare increased with soil depth and the value was generally above 12 mmol l 1 0 5 supplementary fig 2a after one growing season there were great decreases in all treatments supplementary fig 2b the average sare values for s1 s5 treatments were 8 3 5 7 18 1 19 0 and 9 1 mmol l 1 0 5 table 6 respectively the whole soil layers of both s1 and s2 became non alkaline where sare was below 13 mmol l 1 0 5 james et al 1982 chhabra 2004 with reductions of 67 2 and 77 6 respectively the non alkaline zone for s3 s5 treatments only reached to 80 cm depth after the second growing season the average sare for s1 s5 treatments was 9 6 10 5 12 3 12 8 and 15 2 mmol l 1 0 5 table 6 respectively showing a linear relationship between sare and smp threshold as found for ece vs smp threshold from the time perspective the average sare values in s1 s4 had significant reduction trend year by year table 6 while in s5 it decreased significantly in the first season but increased significantly in the second season maintaining the smp higher than 20 kpa could guarantee a reliable reduction trend for sare in the 0 120 cm soil layer 3 3 plant responses 3 3 1 survival rates of plants the survival rate sr in the first year differed between plant species as shown in supplementary table 1 the best srs were the species of amorpha and poplar all with srs 90 followed by golden elm with sr 80 and then by wild peach wild apricot and euonymus maackii with srs 80 the sr of plants in the second year was comparable to sr in the first year suggesting that only some plants died in the second year and that plants srs in different treatments remained stable for the 2 years keeping the smp threshold above 20 kpa could guarantee the srs of the three dominant plants poplar amorpha and golden elm being 87 5 3 3 2 plant growth 3 3 2 1 poplar the increments of four growth indexes h gd dbh and cd for poplar in all treatments at the end of growing seasons of 2015 and 2016 are shown in table 7 although no significant differences were found within treatments for h dbh and cd in the 2015 growing season the gd in s1 was significantly higher than other treatments in the second growing season the growing increments of poplar had increased almost 10 times compared to the first season there were remarkable differences for all growth indexes between treatments at the end of 2016 the highest growth was for treatment s1 with increments of 244 1 cm 41 7 mm 21 7 mm and 169 6 cm for h gd dbh and cd respectively the minimum growth was for s5 with corresponding increments of 92 9 cm 11 5 mm 4 0 mm and 79 8 cm which were only about 30 of s1 the average relative growth rates rgrs of the four growing indexes reduced linearly as smp threshold decreased fig 7 a the linear regression equation revealed that rgr decreased by 3 4 for every 1 kpa decrease when below 5 kpa interestingly the 50 rgr line intersected the regression line at the point with abscissa of s4 20 kpa thus 20 kpa would be a key smp threshold of the half growth increment for poplar 3 3 2 2 astragalus adsurgens the relative coverage rate rcr of astragalus adsurgens decreased linearly with smp threshold decreasing fig 7a similar to that of poplar the correlation between the relative dry matter product rdmr of astragalus adsurgens and smp thresholds showed a different pattern there was a turning point at 20 kpa fig 7b and the trend of rdmr with smp was depicted by two regression lines with different slopes the slope was 1 37 for smp threshold above 17 kpa and slope increased to 2 86 for smp threshold below 17 kpa this indicated that the rdmp had a much greater decrease when smp was controlled below 17 kpa than when above 17 kpa the smp thresholds between 17 and 20 kpa could be an important range for production of astragalus adsurgens 4 discussion 4 1 the smp threshold controls the leaching fraction and soil salinity the total applied irrigation water of different treatment decreased as smp thresholds decreasing table 2 in stage ⅲ which was in accordance with other studies wan et al 2012 chen et al 2015a in fact the smp thresholds also determined the leaching fraction lf kang et al 2012b and wang et al 2012b found that the leaching water amounts for cotton cultivation under precise drip irrigation schedule decreased as smp threshold decreasing during single growing season in an arid area their studies indicated that the deep percolation amounts at 100 cm depth were about 18 14 9 6 and 4 mm when smp threshold controlled at 5 10 15 20 and 25 kpa respectively though leaching water amounts in this study was not measured the lf could be estimated based on the empirical curve that revealed the relationship between lf and the ratio of anticipated soil salinity crop tolerance to irrigation water salinity under high frequency irrigation as showed in supplementary fig 3 scs 1992 the average ece values within rootzones in different treatments fig 6b indicated that soil salinity kept stable in the stage ⅲ in both 2015 and 2016 and the average ece values within rootzones were 0 85 1 45 1 89 2 09 and 2 57 ds m in treatments s1 s5 respectively these stable ece values within rootzones in the stage ⅲ could be interpreted as the anticipated soil salinity or virtual crop tolerance under certain irrigation schedule then the ratios of these values to irrigation water salinity 0 86 ds m were 1 0 1 7 2 2 2 4 and 3 0 in treatments s1 s5 respectively based on the empirical curve for high frequency irrigation curve 2 in supplementary fig 3 the lfs in treatments s1 s5 were 0 20 0 040 0 019 0 015 and 0 010 the leaching amounts in s1 s5 treatments calculated by the total irrigation amount table 3 and rainfall fig 1 were 189 3 29 1 11 2 8 6 and 4 8 mm respectively in 2016 growing season the estimated leaching amounts in s1 and s2 were much higher than that in the studies of kang et al 2012b and wang et al 2012b which might attribute to the shallow rootzones 40 cm depth in this study the average ece increased linearly as smp threshold decreased in top soils within 40 cm in this study and the same results were found by wang et al 2014 and chen et al 2015a the calculated leaching amounts played important role in salt leaching thus the soil salinity within in rootzones increased as leaching amounts decreasing however the linear relationship between ece in the whole soil profiles 0 120 cm and smp was not significant which differed from the result of chen et al 2015a in their study the ece in the whole soil profiles increased sharply as smp threshold decreased but the low leaching amounts in s3 s4 and s5 11 2 8 6 and 4 8 mm respectively in this study might had weak leaching effect on deep soil salt thus the salinity of the whole soil profile was not linearly correlated to the smp thresholds significantly another possible reason was that a filter barrier was laid above water table in the area of chen et al 2015a which reduced the capillarity of groundwater as compared the author s study area was directly exposed to groundwater so the salinity of the whole soil profile was also affected by groundwater dynamics 4 2 prospects of using drip irrigation for afforestation and saline soil reclamation the soil improvement materials such as gypsum and drainage practices were traditionally engaged in afforestation in saline area yildiz et al 2017 conducted an afforestation restoration experiment in an arid region in central asia in which they adopted gypsum and sulfur combined with irrigation and drainage to reclaim saline soil they found the soil infiltration rate increased significantly when 900 mm water was applied after gypsum and sulfur were added into soil and the survival rates of salt tolerant trees were higher than 80 while that of poplar was only 36 in this study the total applied water amount in 2015 and 2016 under recommended irrigation schedule stage ⅰ stage ⅱ and 20 kpa in stage ⅲ was 987 mm table 3 which was similar to that of yildiz et al but the survival rate of poplar in this study was much higher and high to 87 5 gou et al 2017 conducted an experiment aiming at constructing a willow forest with the help of the combination of flood irrigation and embedded drainage ditches in a semi arid saline area in northwest china they found the ditches arranged at 9 m intervals in field was efficient to leach salt and ensure the establishment of the willow forest when 1800 mm water was applied yearly their study area was the same as the author s where suffered from the high water table and heavy salinity the yearly 1800 mm water would raise the water table in the long run unless the forced drainage was applied as compared the yearly applied water under smp scheduled drip irrigation in this study was only one third of that of flood irrigation and the deep percolation was less than 10 mm if the irrigation was triggered at the smp threshold of 20 kpa thus it had little influence on water table in addition about 1200 mm available water was saved yearly under this irrigation schedule when compared with flood irrigation moreover the smp threshold played a very important role in vegetation restoration by using drip irrigation in different climate regions liu et al 2011 reported a smp threshold of 10 kpa was crucial for salt leaching and pasture restoration in soda alkali saline soil in the songnen plain with semi humid climate northeast china li et al 2015b reported a smp above 5 kpa at 20 cm depth under the emitter in the first year and 10 kpa in the second year and 6 mm of irrigation water can be used as an indicator for rose drip irrigation scheduling when irrigating with saline water at 4 01 ds m in initially saline soils with a gravel sand layer after tillage in the bohai gulf with semi humid monsoon climate east china plessis 1985 reported that the low frequency irrigation that smp threshold controlled around 40 kpa for citrus cultivation could reduce soil salt and increase leaching water when adopting weighing lysimeters to determine irrigation quota in south africa with tropical savanna climate the drip irrigation scheduled by smp threshold showed great application potential for its advantages of saving water reducing deep percolation maintaining high survival rates and adapting to different climates when engaged in vegetation restoration in saline area however the amount of winter irrigation that kept salt out of the rootzones in non irrigation seasons winter and early spring under drip irrigation was basic determined by experiences and the critical buried depth of saline groundwater that safe to perennial trees was still unknown all these questions needed to be studied in the near future 5 conclusion the drip irrigation schedule had a dominant influence on salt distribution during the uniform irrigation stages i and ii salt was leached quickly and the desalination rate was 70 87 by the end of stage ii this rate became slower and was correlated to the smp threshold in stage iii the ece and sare increased as smp thresholds decreased and the low salinity and sare zones either kept enlarging or remained stable when smp thresholds were above 20 kpa the phe in all treatments increased with time and remained stable around 8 0 but there were no significant differences among treatments the 2 year srs of plants were stable compared with initial srs the prs of poplar amorpha and golden elm were all 87 5 when smp threshold remained above 20 kpa plant growth reduced with smp thresholds decreasing and with the smp threshold of 20 kpa being a turning point for plant growth under these conditions this study indicated that the three stage drip irrigation ridge vegetation collocation was an efficient method to establish an ecological conservation system in a low lying saline area the smp threshold of 20 kpa was a pivotal value for water and salt regulation in stage iii a three stage drip irrigation schedule could be recommended stage i keeping drip irrigation for a few continuous days until the salt in 0 10 cm soil layer is leached stage ii irrigation controlled at 5 kpa smp threshold at depth of 20 cm and 50 cm for at least 45 days and stage iii irrigation controlled at 20 kpa smp threshold thereafter acknowledgements this study was supported by the national key research and development program of china grant nos 2016yfc0501304 and

10574,drip irrigation has been widely used in arid regions in recent years however how the drip irrigation technology can affect soil evaporation and crop transpiration and whether it can save water under the sufficient irrigation condition are still of great controversy in the world in order to interpret the problem we initially conducted the comparative experiments between the drip irrigated maize field and the border irrigated maize field in large areas during 2014 2018 evapotranspiration et soil evaporation e and crop transpiration t over the drip irrigation di and border irrigation bi treatments were continuously measured by two eddy covariance systems micro lysimeters and the packaged stem sap flow gauges results indicate that the total maize et over the whole crop season under the di treatment was lower than that under the bi treatment by 4 16 2 16 3 in 2014 2015 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively for the whole five years di averagely decreased et by 7 and 40 mm per year against the traditional bi compared to bi di reduced e by 0 1 in 2014 50 in 2015 7 in 2016 22 in 2017 17 in 2018 and 23 30 mm in 2019 averagely and shortened the growth days by 15 23 10 5 and 13 days respectively for the whole five years our research uncovered the et decrease of di against bi was mainly due to the significant reduction in e and growth days in addition the acceleration of crop growth induced by di is a new finding and will provide an important scientific basis for interpreting the magic power of the technology and extending it to more arid regions to solve the global water and food crisis keywords border irrigation drip irrigation evapotranspiration transpiration soil evaporation 1 introduction water scarcity poses a severe global problem to agriculture in semi arid and arid regions that are dominated by irrigated agriculture and restrict the development of economy and agriculture especially to smallholder farmers who cannot afford sophisticated irrigation facilities most farmers on these marginal lands are smallholder farmers with the average household size less than 0 6 hm2 whereas gansu province in nw china is a typical example and has most of such farms it is urgent to develop water saving agriculture technology drip irrigation under film mulch has been a successful water saving irrigation technology in arid regions owing to its two advantages drip irrigation to increase water and fertilizer efficiency postel et al 2001 vázquez et al 2006 and film mulching to reduce water and heat loss from soil ramakrishna et al 2006 zhou et al 2009 di has been widely used in various crop types including food crops wang et al 2000 hou et al 2010 he et al 2018 and cash crops fruits trees vegetables and flowers tiwari et al 2003 costa et al 2007 ibarra et al 2007 coelho et al 2019 tunc et al 2019 in china the technology of drip irrigation under film mulch has been extended to approximately 4 7 million hm2 in china he et al 2018 drip irrigation under mulch could change the water energy nexus and have further influence on the regional eco hydrology process wang et al 2000 coelho et al 2019 qin et al 2019 many studies have investigated the influence on et an important process in water cycle that links soil water and atmospheric water of drip irrigation compared with traditional irrigation under mulch tiwari et al 2003 showed that the yield of cabbage increased under drip irrigation than that of conventional furrow irrigation even with a 40 reduction in water use vázquez et al 2006 indicated that irrigation of 80 of et calculated by the crop coefficient method showed no reduction in crop yield during the tomato growth period but water stress produced by deficit irrigation may increase transpiration hou et al 2010 found that the mulch reduced irrigation water required by 12 and et by 10 based on the water balance method in a potato field bai et al 2015 indicated that the daily et rate of cotton under plastic mulch was lower than that under the non mulched condition qin et al 2016 found that the film mulching drip irrigation lowered about 10 total maize et than that of border irrigation mainly by shortening the length of crop growth nouri et al 2018 investigated the water saving effect of soil mulching and drip irrigation at the catchment scale and concluded that mulching reduced the blue water footprint by 3 6 but mulching combined with drip irrigation reduced it by 4 7 valentín et al 2020 studied that the surface drip systems caused the seasonal maize et reduction of 25 and corresponding t of 30 against sprinkler irrigation the previous studies above indicate that the drip irrigation can reduce soil evaporation and save water however these researches paid little attention to the effect of drip irrigation on crop transpiration under adequate water supply the crop under drip irrigation usually yielded higher biomass leaf area index and yield than that under border irrigation when the same or less amount of water is used therefore the crop under drip irrigation may consume more water and generate higher transpiration whether the drip irrigation can reduce the total evapotranspiration and how much water can drip irrigation save on a regional scale is still of great controversy in addition few studies paid attention to the effect of drip irrigation on crop growth days to answer these questions we conducted long term continuous measurements during 2014 2018 in nw china a region where a transformation from traditional border irrigation to drip irrigation has been undertaken as a national initiative to save irrigation water under film mulching border irrigation bi treatment and film mulching drip irrigation di treatment the study employed eddy covariance systems micro lysimeters and sap flow gauges to measure evapotranspiration soil evaporation and crop transpiration under the bi and di treatments to accurately evaluate the water saving effect of drip irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site field experiments were conducted from 2014 to 2018 at the shiyanghe experimental station for water saving in agriculture and ecology of the china agricultural university n 37 52 e 102 50 elevation 1581 m which is located in wuwei city gansu province nw china the region was characterized as a typical temperate continental arid climate with an annual mean temperature of 8 c an annual accumulated temperature 0 c of approximately 3550 c a mean annual pan evaporation of approximately 2000 mm an annual precipitation of 164 mm and an average annual duration of sunshine of 3000 h the groundwater table in the station is 40 50 m below the ground surface li et al 2013a b li et al 2015 2016 li et al 2018 the experimental soil was usually silty loam at 100 cm depth the distribution of precipitation in the region is uneven during the year with most of the precipitation happening from july to september in summer the experimental area is one of the areas with the most shortage of water resources in nw china due to insufficient precipitation excessive evaporation and uneven distribution of precipitation every year growing maize under plastic mulch is the most commonly practiced cropping system in the region in recent years due to the development of water saving agriculture and deteriorative regional water shortage film mulching drip irrigation has attracted more attention the irrigation practice is shifting from border irrigation to drip irrigation in the experimental areas although border irrigation is still the most common irrigation method to date to improve and analyze local field management the irrigation frequency and amount in our study were consistent with the local standards the growth period of maize under di and bi were shown in table 1 2 2 experimental design this research monitored performance of maize growth with drip irrigation under mulch di and border irrigation under mulch bi over five years during the five year study the treatment followed the local farmers traditional planting mode the plastic mulches were 1 2 m wide covering 4 seed rows the distance between neighboring mulches was 0 4 m and the distance between seed rows under the same mulch was 0 23 m seeds were sown 0 3 m apart within each row the soil type in this region is silty loam male maize seeds and female maize seeds were one line for male plants and several lines for female plants the experimental sites were shown in fig 1 the bi treatment is the most common irrigation method with an area of 400 m 200 m during 2014 2015 site i and an area of 500 m 250 m during 2016 2018 site ii the soil at 100 cm depth had an average soil dry bulk density of 1 52 g cm 3 and a field capacity of 0 29 cm3 cm 3 from 2014 to 2015 in addition the average soil dry bulk density was 1 52 g cm 3 and soil field capacity 0 32 cm3 cm 3 at 100 cm depth in 2016 and 2018 the di treatment covered an area of 2000 m 1000 m during 2014 2015 site iii and 400 m 200 m from 2016 to 2018 site i the soil at 100 cm depth had an average soil dry bulk density of 1 52 g cm 3 and a field capacity of 0 30 cm3 cm 3 from 2014 to 2015 in addition the average soil dry bulk density was 1 52 g cm 3 and the soil field capacity was 0 29 cm3 cm 3 at 100 cm depth during 2016 2018 2 3 measurements in the maize field 2 3 1 eddy covariance system the eddy covariance ec system has the advantages of high measurement precision and fast sampling frequency evapotranspiration was measured by an ec system in the central south of the maize field maize is the principal crop cultivated in the surrounding regions and adequate fetch can be met for ec measurement during 2014 2018 the locations of ec system were shown in fig 1 site i in 2014 there was an old ec system consisted of a 3 d sonic anemometer thermometer model csat3 a krypton hygrometer modelkh20 a temperature and humidity sensor model hmp45c a net radiometer model nr lite and two soil heat flux plates model hfp01 as described by li et al 2013a b li et al 2015 2016 and li et al 2018 during 2016 2018 a new eddy covariance ec system was installed in the site to replace the old one under the bi treatment the new ec system consisted of a co2 h2o open path gas analyzer model ec150 two temperature and rh probes model hmp155a a kipp zonen radiometer model cnr4 two soil heat flux plates model hfp01 a set of water content reflectometer model cs616 a set of soil thermocouple probes model tcav and an infrared radiometer model si 111 these instruments have been described by qin et al 2016 and qin et al 2019 site ii and site iii in site ii the ec system was the same as the new ec system of site i during 2015 2018 along with change in the experiment site the ec system of site ii was moved to site iii for data collection during 2016 2018 in 2014 the sensors were 1 0 m above the maize canopy during 2015 2018 the ec150 and cnr4 sensors were 4 0 m above the ground surface and the hmp155a sensors were 2 m 4 m and 6 m above the ground surface respectively additionally two hfp01 plates were installed deeper than 5 cm below the mulched soil and bare soil respectively five water content sensors and five soil temperature probes were set at 20 cm 40 cm 60 cm 80 cm and 100 cm respectively the system was manufactured by campell scientific in usa the 30 min energy flux data such as the latent sensible radiation and ground heat fluxes were obtained from the ec system with a sampling frequency of 20 hz the ec flux data were collected by a cr3000 data logger and then disposed and converted into available data 30 minute interval with eddy pro 4 0 software due to the influences of weather and some other factors eddy pro software was used to assess and correct the data before further analysis the basic procedures exercised are as follows 1 the raw peaks detection and elimination 2 double coordinate rotation method finnigan et al 2003 3 the correction of frequency loss 4 the correction of air density webb et al 1980 then the software evaluated the data to remove the unreliable data additionally the software estimated the footprint of ec measurement data taken out of the experimental area should be deleted qin et al 2018 as for the missing data the linear interpolation method was used for data gap filling when fewer than four observations were missing and the mdv mean diurnal variation method was adopted when five or more observations were missing falge et al 2001 2 3 2 sap flow stem flow gauges flow32 1 k dynamax co usa were used to measure maize transpiration the probes were installed 20 cm above the ground on eight maize stems five female plants and three male plants and data were collected with the cr1000 data logger with a sampling frequency of 20 hz the sap flow and transcription rate were calculated using methods described previously by jiang 2014 the monitored flux data l d 1 of the sap flow were firstly scaled to the specific maize transpiration mm d 1 per plant by the mean surface area then the average monitored female male maize transpiration per plant was obtained from the monitored eight plants and scaled to the field female male maize transpiration mm d 1 using the average monitored female male plant leaf area and the field female male plant leaf area index respectively jiang et al 2014 the maize transpiration mm d 1 was calculated by summing the products of the female and male plant transpiration and ratios of female and male plants to the total number of plants 2 3 3 soil evaporation the micro lysimeter method was used to measured soil evaporation every day the height and diameter of micro lysimeter pvc tubes were 20 cm and 10 cm respectively three micro lysimeters were buried in the middle of mulch and three others were set in the bare soil between mulch areas under both treatments during 2014 2018 fig 2 all these micro lysimeters were weighted by an electronic balance mettler toledo pl6001 l usa at 7 30 pm daily to get the amount of soil water evaporation per day the average soil evaporation under mulch bare soil was obtained from the observed values and converted to soil evaporation under mulch bare soil per unit area then the field soil evaporation was calculated by summing the products of soil evaporation under mulch and bare soil and ratios of each part to the whole field previous studies considered soil water evaporation under plastic mulch negligible assuming that the plastic mulch can prevent water exchange between soil and atmosphere completely the observations of qin 2018 indicated that the soil water evaporation under plastic mulch ems was about 4 04 7 07 of the total evapotranspiration among which ems in the daytime accounted for 3 58 5 37 of the total evapotranspiration and 0 99 2 10 of the total evapotranspiration in the nighttime thus ems was considered not to be negligible these results provide support insight for our under mulching setup of the micro lysimeters 2 3 4 measurements of other experimental items the irrigation amount was controlled by water meters soil water contents swc were measured at 20 cm intervals along soil profiles in the range of 0 100 cm by the cs616 probes meanwhile soil samples with five replications were collected at the same depths every 7 10 days to get calibration data of swc by the oven drying method the precipitation and wind speed at a height of 2 m were recorded by an automatic weather station h21001 onset computer crop cape cod ma usa the data were sampled every 5 s and calculations were made every 15 min by a data logger field observation items and measurements are listed in table 2 2 3 5 data interpolation 1 sap flow interpolation the thermal balance system measurements have specific requirements on the thickness of the stem maize plants in the early stage with thinner stems are not suitable to observe the stem flow interpolation need to be done to obtain the variation of maize transpiration over the whole growth period in the previous study by li 2013 and qin 2018 the adjusted shuttleworth wallace model considering the mulching effect on evapotranspiration performed well on simulating evapotranspiration transpiration and evaporation under the mulch condition in arid areas this model was used to interpolate the missing transpiration data in our study 2 soil evaporation interpolation when encountering continuous rainfall events and high amount irrigation events the micro lysimeters cannot get accurate data by the interpolation of maize transpiration described above and ec system we obtained evapotranspiration data and transpiration data during the whole growth period the missing evaporation data can be obtained by subtracting transpiration from evapotranspiration on the same day 3 results 3 1 comparison of evapotranspiration etbi under the border irrigation bi treatment and evapotranspiration etdi under the drip irrigation di treatment the daily variation of etbi and etdi during 2014 2018 are shown in fig 3 in the early growth period the maize plant was small with extremely low degree of canopy coverage and the evapotranspiration process was dominated by evaporation therefore both etbi and etdi increased as the soil evaporation increased after the rainfall or irrigation due to the similar meteorological conditions and growth conditions both of etbi and etdi were close with a relatively gentle daily fluctuation during 2014 2018 in the middle growth period the maize grew rapidly the lai increased rapidly and then kept at a higher and more stable value for about 40 days after the rapid growth stage soil evaporation was gradually limited while plant transpiration gradually increased both etbi and etdi were gradually increased compared to the previous stage due to more frequent rainfall and irrigation both etbi and etdi fluctuated greatly there were some differences in crop growth and surface water content between bi treatment and di treatment which ended up with obviously higher etdi than etbi in the rapid growth stage but the duration varied from 2014 to 2018 in the late growth period etbi and etdi were both reduced due to senescence of crop less radiation at the soil surface decreased temperature irrigation and rainfall for the whole growth period we find that the total etbi was higher than total etdi during 2014 2017 and the total etbi was very close to total etdi in 2018 fig 4 a e the daily etdi was equal to 0 96 etbi of the five years fig 4 f table 3 showed the total et average et and daily et rate under two treatments respectively during 2014 2018 with the change of the irrigation mode from film mulching border irrigation to film mulching drip irrigation the annual mean et during the whole growth stage decreased 40 mm about 7 and the annual mean daily et rate decreased 0 05 mm d 1 during 2014 2018 3 2 comparison of evaporation ebi under the border irrigation treatment bi and evaporation edi under the drip irrigation treatment di the daily variation of ebi and edi during 2014 2018 are shown in fig 5 in the early growth period the surface canopy coverage radiation rainfall and mulching ratio were similar under both treatments therefore the evaporation of this stage was mainly affected by the irrigation events and the moisture condition of surface soil edi of this stage was sufficiently higher than that of later stages but ebi were slightly higher than that of later stages during 2014 2018 in the middle growth period the maize grew rapidly lai increased rapidly radiation enhanced the irrigation and rainfall increased gradually ebi was obviously higher than edi during 2014 2018 due to the less frequency and more quantity irrigation traits under the bi treatment the same observation could also be found in later growth periods due to the early end of harvest time under the di treatment during the five years in the late growth period ebi was higher than edi during 2014 2018 due to the lower canopy coverage at the soil surface during 2014 2016 higher soil surface water content in 2017 and longer duration under the di treatment from 2014 to 2018 for the whole growth period the total ebi was distinctly higher than the total edi during 2015 2018 and slightly higher than the total edi in 2014 fig 6 a e the daily edi was equal to 0 71 ebi of the five years fig 4 f table 3 has shown the total e average e and daily e rate under the two treatments respectively during 2014 2018 with the change of the irrigation mode from film mulching border irrigation to film mulching drip irrigation the annual mean e during the whole growth stage decreased by 30 mm about 23 and the annual mean daily e rate decreased by 0 13 mm d 1 during 2014 2018 3 3 comparison of transpiration tbi under the border irrigation treatment bi and transpiration tdi under the drip irrigation treatment di the daily variations of tbi and tdi during 2014 2018 are shown in fig 7 in the early growth period the maize began to enter the growth stage when the lai was very small and both tbi and tdi have small values the diurnal variation curve of tbi and tdi fluctuated slowly upward during 2014 2018 in the middle growth period with the increase of crop growth and surface canopy coverage soil evaporation was gradually restricted and plant transpiration gradually increased tbi and tdi were gradually increased during 2014 2018 at the early time the laidi was greater than laibi but the duration varied from 2014 to 2018 the relative relationship between tbi and tdi was often corresponded to that between laibi and laidi in the late growth period the relative relationship between tbi and tdi was also corresponded to that between laibi and laidi tbi and tdi were similar and gradually decreased for the whole growth period the total tbi was close to the total tdi during 2014 2018 fig 8 a e the daily tdi was equal to 1 00 tbi of five years fig 8 f table 3 has shown the total t average t and daily t rate under the two treatments respectively during 2014 2018 with the change of irrigation mode from film mulching border irrigation to film mulching drip irrigation the annual mean t during the whole growth stage decreased by 10 mm about 2 and the annual mean daily t rate increased by 0 19 mm d 1 during 2014 2018 3 4 comparison of the ratios of evaporation to evapotranspiration ebi etbi under the bi treatment and evaporation to evapotranspiration edi etdi under the di treatment transpiration to evapotranspiration tbi etbi under the bi treatment and transpiration to evapotranspiration tdi etdi under the di treatment the daily variations of ebi etbi and edi etdi tbi etbi and tdi etdi during 2014 2018 are shown in fig 9 due to the relatively low coverage of the surface canopy evaporation made the majority of evapotranspiration during the early period the percentage of evaporation decreased as the crop was growing the ebi etbi and edi etdi shared a similar proportion in 2014 2018 t et under both treatments had the opposite pattern with crop growth and increase of vegetation coverage e et and t et gradually increased under both treatments then ebi etbi was distinctly larger during 2015 2017 and slightly larger in 2014 and 2018 than edi etdi owing to the less difference in the irrigation volume under both treatments during 2014 and 2018 finally ebi etbi shared a larger value than edi etdi at the end of crop growth stage during 2014 2018 for the whole growth period the daily ebi etbi was higher than the daily edi etdi during 2014 2018 fig 10 a the daily edi etdi was equal to 0 93 ebi etbi of the five years fig 10 a inversely the daily tbi etbi was lower than the daily tdi etdi during 2014 2018 fig 10 b the daily tdi etdi was equal to 1 02 tbi etbi of the five years fig 10 b table 3 has shown e et under both treatments respectively during 2014 2018 with the change of the irrigation mode from film mulching border irrigation to film mulching drip irrigation the annual e et during the whole growth stage decreased by 0 8 in 2014 12 4 in 2015 1 1 in 2016 1 5 in 2017 and 4 4 in 2018 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 why did drip irrigation reduce et compared with the traditional border irrigation results indicate that the annual mean etdi decreased by 40 mm about 7 where tdi decreased by 10 mm about 2 and edt decreased by 30 mm about 23 compared with those under the bi treatment over the five years fig 9 table 2 our results confirmed that drip irrigation can averagely reduce et by 7 on a long term time scale and the regional spatial scale this can be primarily attributed to the significant reduction in soil evaporation induced by drip irrigation this advantage was mentioned by the previous studies costa et al 2007 valentín et al 2020 compared with the bi treatment the di treatment induced a lower irrigation amount and a smaller wetting area and the irrigation occurred under the mulching film the plastic mulch significantly increased the water transfer resistance and severely limited the water vapor exchange between the mulched soil and atmosphere qin et al 2016 jin et al 2018 the irrigation water in the di treatment was more difficult permeating to the bare soil surface which was an important place for soil evaporation the second reason is the significant acceleration of crop growth induced by drip irrigation different from the traditional bi treatment the multi frequency irrigation and sub mulch fertilization under the di treatment provided a better water and nutrition environment for plant growth jones 2004 hou et al 2010 bai et al 2015 qin et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 concluded that lower water stress of di against bi resulted in better developed crop canopy which in turn intercepted more energy and thus increased et the growth days were shortened by 15 days in 2014 23 days in 2015 10 days in 2016 5 days in 2017 13 days in 2018 and average 13 days during 2014 2018 against the bi treatment fig 11 this is caused by the higher daily temperature and less water stress under the di treatment compared to the bi treatment yuan et al 2003 mendelsohn and dinar 2003 hou et al 2010 qin et al 2016 thus the di treatment decreased evaporation accelerated crop growth and shortened the crop growth period though the daily average transpiration under the di treatment may enhance et during the whole crop growth period can reduce compared with that under the bi treatment 4 2 why was edi etdi lower than ebi etbi during the whole growth stage previous studies find that different irrigation methods significantly influenced the ratio of soil evaporation to evapotranspiration zegada and berliner 2011 zhang et al 2013 martins et al 2013 many researchers investigated e et under traditional irrigation and reported that e et might vary from 30 60 yunusa et al 1997 sánchez et al 2015 trout and dejonge 2017 valentín et al 2020 our results find that e et under the di treatment varied from 18 to 23 and under the bi treatment was 20 31 this is similar with the study of li and ma 2019 and rodrigues et al 2013 who reported e accounted for 15 24 of the maize et under di the di treatment reduced by 0 8 in 2014 12 4 in 2015 1 1 in 2016 1 5 in 2017 4 4 in 2018 and average 4 during the five years the results showed the di treatment can improve the components ratio of et previous studies show that the rate of water loss water leaching and e under bi can exceed 40 liu et al 2017a zheng et al 2017 compared to about 13 under di liu et al 2017b umair et al 2019 meanwhile our study suggested that the di treatment reduced e during the whole crop growth period compared with bi though et may decrease at the same time the reduction of evaporation was greater than that of evapotranspiration in addition as the di treatment accelerated crop growth it had higher leaf area index values to capture radiation and larger daily average transpiration zhang et al 2020 when compared with the bi treatment the higher leaf area index may result in the higher surface canopy coverage which was also attributable to the reduction in evaporation 5 conclusion based on the continuous flux measurements over the drip irrigated and border irrigated maize fields we confirmed that the drip irrigation can averagely decrease soil evaporation by 30 mm and 23 shorten the growth days by 13 days and 9 compared with the traditional border irrigation on a five year and regional scale these resulted in a 7 reduction in total evapotranspiration under drip irrigation here we provide an important scientific basis to explain the effects of drip irrigation on crop growth and its water saving mechanism under real field conditions over a 5 year period with a clear advantage in crop growth drip irrigation under mulch is anticipated to be more extensively applied in nw china and other similar regions in the world declaration of competing interest author declares that no

10574,drip irrigation has been widely used in arid regions in recent years however how the drip irrigation technology can affect soil evaporation and crop transpiration and whether it can save water under the sufficient irrigation condition are still of great controversy in the world in order to interpret the problem we initially conducted the comparative experiments between the drip irrigated maize field and the border irrigated maize field in large areas during 2014 2018 evapotranspiration et soil evaporation e and crop transpiration t over the drip irrigation di and border irrigation bi treatments were continuously measured by two eddy covariance systems micro lysimeters and the packaged stem sap flow gauges results indicate that the total maize et over the whole crop season under the di treatment was lower than that under the bi treatment by 4 16 2 16 3 in 2014 2015 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively for the whole five years di averagely decreased et by 7 and 40 mm per year against the traditional bi compared to bi di reduced e by 0 1 in 2014 50 in 2015 7 in 2016 22 in 2017 17 in 2018 and 23 30 mm in 2019 averagely and shortened the growth days by 15 23 10 5 and 13 days respectively for the whole five years our research uncovered the et decrease of di against bi was mainly due to the significant reduction in e and growth days in addition the acceleration of crop growth induced by di is a new finding and will provide an important scientific basis for interpreting the magic power of the technology and extending it to more arid regions to solve the global water and food crisis keywords border irrigation drip irrigation evapotranspiration transpiration soil evaporation 1 introduction water scarcity poses a severe global problem to agriculture in semi arid and arid regions that are dominated by irrigated agriculture and restrict the development of economy and agriculture especially to smallholder farmers who cannot afford sophisticated irrigation facilities most farmers on these marginal lands are smallholder farmers with the average household size less than 0 6 hm2 whereas gansu province in nw china is a typical example and has most of such farms it is urgent to develop water saving agriculture technology drip irrigation under film mulch has been a successful water saving irrigation technology in arid regions owing to its two advantages drip irrigation to increase water and fertilizer efficiency postel et al 2001 vázquez et al 2006 and film mulching to reduce water and heat loss from soil ramakrishna et al 2006 zhou et al 2009 di has been widely used in various crop types including food crops wang et al 2000 hou et al 2010 he et al 2018 and cash crops fruits trees vegetables and flowers tiwari et al 2003 costa et al 2007 ibarra et al 2007 coelho et al 2019 tunc et al 2019 in china the technology of drip irrigation under film mulch has been extended to approximately 4 7 million hm2 in china he et al 2018 drip irrigation under mulch could change the water energy nexus and have further influence on the regional eco hydrology process wang et al 2000 coelho et al 2019 qin et al 2019 many studies have investigated the influence on et an important process in water cycle that links soil water and atmospheric water of drip irrigation compared with traditional irrigation under mulch tiwari et al 2003 showed that the yield of cabbage increased under drip irrigation than that of conventional furrow irrigation even with a 40 reduction in water use vázquez et al 2006 indicated that irrigation of 80 of et calculated by the crop coefficient method showed no reduction in crop yield during the tomato growth period but water stress produced by deficit irrigation may increase transpiration hou et al 2010 found that the mulch reduced irrigation water required by 12 and et by 10 based on the water balance method in a potato field bai et al 2015 indicated that the daily et rate of cotton under plastic mulch was lower than that under the non mulched condition qin et al 2016 found that the film mulching drip irrigation lowered about 10 total maize et than that of border irrigation mainly by shortening the length of crop growth nouri et al 2018 investigated the water saving effect of soil mulching and drip irrigation at the catchment scale and concluded that mulching reduced the blue water footprint by 3 6 but mulching combined with drip irrigation reduced it by 4 7 valentín et al 2020 studied that the surface drip systems caused the seasonal maize et reduction of 25 and corresponding t of 30 against sprinkler irrigation the previous studies above indicate that the drip irrigation can reduce soil evaporation and save water however these researches paid little attention to the effect of drip irrigation on crop transpiration under adequate water supply the crop under drip irrigation usually yielded higher biomass leaf area index and yield than that under border irrigation when the same or less amount of water is used therefore the crop under drip irrigation may consume more water and generate higher transpiration whether the drip irrigation can reduce the total evapotranspiration and how much water can drip irrigation save on a regional scale is still of great controversy in addition few studies paid attention to the effect of drip irrigation on crop growth days to answer these questions we conducted long term continuous measurements during 2014 2018 in nw china a region where a transformation from traditional border irrigation to drip irrigation has been undertaken as a national initiative to save irrigation water under film mulching border irrigation bi treatment and film mulching drip irrigation di treatment the study employed eddy covariance systems micro lysimeters and sap flow gauges to measure evapotranspiration soil evaporation and crop transpiration under the bi and di treatments to accurately evaluate the water saving effect of drip irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site field experiments were conducted from 2014 to 2018 at the shiyanghe experimental station for water saving in agriculture and ecology of the china agricultural university n 37 52 e 102 50 elevation 1581 m which is located in wuwei city gansu province nw china the region was characterized as a typical temperate continental arid climate with an annual mean temperature of 8 c an annual accumulated temperature 0 c of approximately 3550 c a mean annual pan evaporation of approximately 2000 mm an annual precipitation of 164 mm and an average annual duration of sunshine of 3000 h the groundwater table in the station is 40 50 m below the ground surface li et al 2013a b li et al 2015 2016 li et al 2018 the experimental soil was usually silty loam at 100 cm depth the distribution of precipitation in the region is uneven during the year with most of the precipitation happening from july to september in summer the experimental area is one of the areas with the most shortage of water resources in nw china due to insufficient precipitation excessive evaporation and uneven distribution of precipitation every year growing maize under plastic mulch is the most commonly practiced cropping system in the region in recent years due to the development of water saving agriculture and deteriorative regional water shortage film mulching drip irrigation has attracted more attention the irrigation practice is shifting from border irrigation to drip irrigation in the experimental areas although border irrigation is still the most common irrigation method to date to improve and analyze local field management the irrigation frequency and amount in our study were consistent with the local standards the growth period of maize under di and bi were shown in table 1 2 2 experimental design this research monitored performance of maize growth with drip irrigation under mulch di and border irrigation under mulch bi over five years during the five year study the treatment followed the local farmers traditional planting mode the plastic mulches were 1 2 m wide covering 4 seed rows the distance between neighboring mulches was 0 4 m and the distance between seed rows under the same mulch was 0 23 m seeds were sown 0 3 m apart within each row the soil type in this region is silty loam male maize seeds and female maize seeds were one line for male plants and several lines for female plants the experimental sites were shown in fig 1 the bi treatment is the most common irrigation method with an area of 400 m 200 m during 2014 2015 site i and an area of 500 m 250 m during 2016 2018 site ii the soil at 100 cm depth had an average soil dry bulk density of 1 52 g cm 3 and a field capacity of 0 29 cm3 cm 3 from 2014 to 2015 in addition the average soil dry bulk density was 1 52 g cm 3 and soil field capacity 0 32 cm3 cm 3 at 100 cm depth in 2016 and 2018 the di treatment covered an area of 2000 m 1000 m during 2014 2015 site iii and 400 m 200 m from 2016 to 2018 site i the soil at 100 cm depth had an average soil dry bulk density of 1 52 g cm 3 and a field capacity of 0 30 cm3 cm 3 from 2014 to 2015 in addition the average soil dry bulk density was 1 52 g cm 3 and the soil field capacity was 0 29 cm3 cm 3 at 100 cm depth during 2016 2018 2 3 measurements in the maize field 2 3 1 eddy covariance system the eddy covariance ec system has the advantages of high measurement precision and fast sampling frequency evapotranspiration was measured by an ec system in the central south of the maize field maize is the principal crop cultivated in the surrounding regions and adequate fetch can be met for ec measurement during 2014 2018 the locations of ec system were shown in fig 1 site i in 2014 there was an old ec system consisted of a 3 d sonic anemometer thermometer model csat3 a krypton hygrometer modelkh20 a temperature and humidity sensor model hmp45c a net radiometer model nr lite and two soil heat flux plates model hfp01 as described by li et al 2013a b li et al 2015 2016 and li et al 2018 during 2016 2018 a new eddy covariance ec system was installed in the site to replace the old one under the bi treatment the new ec system consisted of a co2 h2o open path gas analyzer model ec150 two temperature and rh probes model hmp155a a kipp zonen radiometer model cnr4 two soil heat flux plates model hfp01 a set of water content reflectometer model cs616 a set of soil thermocouple probes model tcav and an infrared radiometer model si 111 these instruments have been described by qin et al 2016 and qin et al 2019 site ii and site iii in site ii the ec system was the same as the new ec system of site i during 2015 2018 along with change in the experiment site the ec system of site ii was moved to site iii for data collection during 2016 2018 in 2014 the sensors were 1 0 m above the maize canopy during 2015 2018 the ec150 and cnr4 sensors were 4 0 m above the ground surface and the hmp155a sensors were 2 m 4 m and 6 m above the ground surface respectively additionally two hfp01 plates were installed deeper than 5 cm below the mulched soil and bare soil respectively five water content sensors and five soil temperature probes were set at 20 cm 40 cm 60 cm 80 cm and 100 cm respectively the system was manufactured by campell scientific in usa the 30 min energy flux data such as the latent sensible radiation and ground heat fluxes were obtained from the ec system with a sampling frequency of 20 hz the ec flux data were collected by a cr3000 data logger and then disposed and converted into available data 30 minute interval with eddy pro 4 0 software due to the influences of weather and some other factors eddy pro software was used to assess and correct the data before further analysis the basic procedures exercised are as follows 1 the raw peaks detection and elimination 2 double coordinate rotation method finnigan et al 2003 3 the correction of frequency loss 4 the correction of air density webb et al 1980 then the software evaluated the data to remove the unreliable data additionally the software estimated the footprint of ec measurement data taken out of the experimental area should be deleted qin et al 2018 as for the missing data the linear interpolation method was used for data gap filling when fewer than four observations were missing and the mdv mean diurnal variation method was adopted when five or more observations were missing falge et al 2001 2 3 2 sap flow stem flow gauges flow32 1 k dynamax co usa were used to measure maize transpiration the probes were installed 20 cm above the ground on eight maize stems five female plants and three male plants and data were collected with the cr1000 data logger with a sampling frequency of 20 hz the sap flow and transcription rate were calculated using methods described previously by jiang 2014 the monitored flux data l d 1 of the sap flow were firstly scaled to the specific maize transpiration mm d 1 per plant by the mean surface area then the average monitored female male maize transpiration per plant was obtained from the monitored eight plants and scaled to the field female male maize transpiration mm d 1 using the average monitored female male plant leaf area and the field female male plant leaf area index respectively jiang et al 2014 the maize transpiration mm d 1 was calculated by summing the products of the female and male plant transpiration and ratios of female and male plants to the total number of plants 2 3 3 soil evaporation the micro lysimeter method was used to measured soil evaporation every day the height and diameter of micro lysimeter pvc tubes were 20 cm and 10 cm respectively three micro lysimeters were buried in the middle of mulch and three others were set in the bare soil between mulch areas under both treatments during 2014 2018 fig 2 all these micro lysimeters were weighted by an electronic balance mettler toledo pl6001 l usa at 7 30 pm daily to get the amount of soil water evaporation per day the average soil evaporation under mulch bare soil was obtained from the observed values and converted to soil evaporation under mulch bare soil per unit area then the field soil evaporation was calculated by summing the products of soil evaporation under mulch and bare soil and ratios of each part to the whole field previous studies considered soil water evaporation under plastic mulch negligible assuming that the plastic mulch can prevent water exchange between soil and atmosphere completely the observations of qin 2018 indicated that the soil water evaporation under plastic mulch ems was about 4 04 7 07 of the total evapotranspiration among which ems in the daytime accounted for 3 58 5 37 of the total evapotranspiration and 0 99 2 10 of the total evapotranspiration in the nighttime thus ems was considered not to be negligible these results provide support insight for our under mulching setup of the micro lysimeters 2 3 4 measurements of other experimental items the irrigation amount was controlled by water meters soil water contents swc were measured at 20 cm intervals along soil profiles in the range of 0 100 cm by the cs616 probes meanwhile soil samples with five replications were collected at the same depths every 7 10 days to get calibration data of swc by the oven drying method the precipitation and wind speed at a height of 2 m were recorded by an automatic weather station h21001 onset computer crop cape cod ma usa the data were sampled every 5 s and calculations were made every 15 min by a data logger field observation items and measurements are listed in table 2 2 3 5 data interpolation 1 sap flow interpolation the thermal balance system measurements have specific requirements on the thickness of the stem maize plants in the early stage with thinner stems are not suitable to observe the stem flow interpolation need to be done to obtain the variation of maize transpiration over the whole growth period in the previous study by li 2013 and qin 2018 the adjusted shuttleworth wallace model considering the mulching effect on evapotranspiration performed well on simulating evapotranspiration transpiration and evaporation under the mulch condition in arid areas this model was used to interpolate the missing transpiration data in our study 2 soil evaporation interpolation when encountering continuous rainfall events and high amount irrigation events the micro lysimeters cannot get accurate data by the interpolation of maize transpiration described above and ec system we obtained evapotranspiration data and transpiration data during the whole growth period the missing evaporation data can be obtained by subtracting transpiration from evapotranspiration on the same day 3 results 3 1 comparison of evapotranspiration etbi under the border irrigation bi treatment and evapotranspiration etdi under the drip irrigation di treatment the daily variation of etbi and etdi during 2014 2018 are shown in fig 3 in the early growth period the maize plant was small with extremely low degree of canopy coverage and the evapotranspiration process was dominated by evaporation therefore both etbi and etdi increased as the soil evaporation increased after the rainfall or irrigation due to the similar meteorological conditions and growth conditions both of etbi and etdi were close with a relatively gentle daily fluctuation during 2014 2018 in the middle growth period the maize grew rapidly the lai increased rapidly and then kept at a higher and more stable value for about 40 days after the rapid growth stage soil evaporation was gradually limited while plant transpiration gradually increased both etbi and etdi were gradually increased compared to the previous stage due to more frequent rainfall and irrigation both etbi and etdi fluctuated greatly there were some differences in crop growth and surface water content between bi treatment and di treatment which ended up with obviously higher etdi than etbi in the rapid growth stage but the duration varied from 2014 to 2018 in the late growth period etbi and etdi were both reduced due to senescence of crop less radiation at the soil surface decreased temperature irrigation and rainfall for the whole growth period we find that the total etbi was higher than total etdi during 2014 2017 and the total etbi was very close to total etdi in 2018 fig 4 a e the daily etdi was equal to 0 96 etbi of the five years fig 4 f table 3 showed the total et average et and daily et rate under two treatments respectively during 2014 2018 with the change of the irrigation mode from film mulching border irrigation to film mulching drip irrigation the annual mean et during the whole growth stage decreased 40 mm about 7 and the annual mean daily et rate decreased 0 05 mm d 1 during 2014 2018 3 2 comparison of evaporation ebi under the border irrigation treatment bi and evaporation edi under the drip irrigation treatment di the daily variation of ebi and edi during 2014 2018 are shown in fig 5 in the early growth period the surface canopy coverage radiation rainfall and mulching ratio were similar under both treatments therefore the evaporation of this stage was mainly affected by the irrigation events and the moisture condition of surface soil edi of this stage was sufficiently higher than that of later stages but ebi were slightly higher than that of later stages during 2014 2018 in the middle growth period the maize grew rapidly lai increased rapidly radiation enhanced the irrigation and rainfall increased gradually ebi was obviously higher than edi during 2014 2018 due to the less frequency and more quantity irrigation traits under the bi treatment the same observation could also be found in later growth periods due to the early end of harvest time under the di treatment during the five years in the late growth period ebi was higher than edi during 2014 2018 due to the lower canopy coverage at the soil surface during 2014 2016 higher soil surface water content in 2017 and longer duration under the di treatment from 2014 to 2018 for the whole growth period the total ebi was distinctly higher than the total edi during 2015 2018 and slightly higher than the total edi in 2014 fig 6 a e the daily edi was equal to 0 71 ebi of the five years fig 4 f table 3 has shown the total e average e and daily e rate under the two treatments respectively during 2014 2018 with the change of the irrigation mode from film mulching border irrigation to film mulching drip irrigation the annual mean e during the whole growth stage decreased by 30 mm about 23 and the annual mean daily e rate decreased by 0 13 mm d 1 during 2014 2018 3 3 comparison of transpiration tbi under the border irrigation treatment bi and transpiration tdi under the drip irrigation treatment di the daily variations of tbi and tdi during 2014 2018 are shown in fig 7 in the early growth period the maize began to enter the growth stage when the lai was very small and both tbi and tdi have small values the diurnal variation curve of tbi and tdi fluctuated slowly upward during 2014 2018 in the middle growth period with the increase of crop growth and surface canopy coverage soil evaporation was gradually restricted and plant transpiration gradually increased tbi and tdi were gradually increased during 2014 2018 at the early time the laidi was greater than laibi but the duration varied from 2014 to 2018 the relative relationship between tbi and tdi was often corresponded to that between laibi and laidi in the late growth period the relative relationship between tbi and tdi was also corresponded to that between laibi and laidi tbi and tdi were similar and gradually decreased for the whole growth period the total tbi was close to the total tdi during 2014 2018 fig 8 a e the daily tdi was equal to 1 00 tbi of five years fig 8 f table 3 has shown the total t average t and daily t rate under the two treatments respectively during 2014 2018 with the change of irrigation mode from film mulching border irrigation to film mulching drip irrigation the annual mean t during the whole growth stage decreased by 10 mm about 2 and the annual mean daily t rate increased by 0 19 mm d 1 during 2014 2018 3 4 comparison of the ratios of evaporation to evapotranspiration ebi etbi under the bi treatment and evaporation to evapotranspiration edi etdi under the di treatment transpiration to evapotranspiration tbi etbi under the bi treatment and transpiration to evapotranspiration tdi etdi under the di treatment the daily variations of ebi etbi and edi etdi tbi etbi and tdi etdi during 2014 2018 are shown in fig 9 due to the relatively low coverage of the surface canopy evaporation made the majority of evapotranspiration during the early period the percentage of evaporation decreased as the crop was growing the ebi etbi and edi etdi shared a similar proportion in 2014 2018 t et under both treatments had the opposite pattern with crop growth and increase of vegetation coverage e et and t et gradually increased under both treatments then ebi etbi was distinctly larger during 2015 2017 and slightly larger in 2014 and 2018 than edi etdi owing to the less difference in the irrigation volume under both treatments during 2014 and 2018 finally ebi etbi shared a larger value than edi etdi at the end of crop growth stage during 2014 2018 for the whole growth period the daily ebi etbi was higher than the daily edi etdi during 2014 2018 fig 10 a the daily edi etdi was equal to 0 93 ebi etbi of the five years fig 10 a inversely the daily tbi etbi was lower than the daily tdi etdi during 2014 2018 fig 10 b the daily tdi etdi was equal to 1 02 tbi etbi of the five years fig 10 b table 3 has shown e et under both treatments respectively during 2014 2018 with the change of the irrigation mode from film mulching border irrigation to film mulching drip irrigation the annual e et during the whole growth stage decreased by 0 8 in 2014 12 4 in 2015 1 1 in 2016 1 5 in 2017 and 4 4 in 2018 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 why did drip irrigation reduce et compared with the traditional border irrigation results indicate that the annual mean etdi decreased by 40 mm about 7 where tdi decreased by 10 mm about 2 and edt decreased by 30 mm about 23 compared with those under the bi treatment over the five years fig 9 table 2 our results confirmed that drip irrigation can averagely reduce et by 7 on a long term time scale and the regional spatial scale this can be primarily attributed to the significant reduction in soil evaporation induced by drip irrigation this advantage was mentioned by the previous studies costa et al 2007 valentín et al 2020 compared with the bi treatment the di treatment induced a lower irrigation amount and a smaller wetting area and the irrigation occurred under the mulching film the plastic mulch significantly increased the water transfer resistance and severely limited the water vapor exchange between the mulched soil and atmosphere qin et al 2016 jin et al 2018 the irrigation water in the di treatment was more difficult permeating to the bare soil surface which was an important place for soil evaporation the second reason is the significant acceleration of crop growth induced by drip irrigation different from the traditional bi treatment the multi frequency irrigation and sub mulch fertilization under the di treatment provided a better water and nutrition environment for plant growth jones 2004 hou et al 2010 bai et al 2015 qin et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 concluded that lower water stress of di against bi resulted in better developed crop canopy which in turn intercepted more energy and thus increased et the growth days were shortened by 15 days in 2014 23 days in 2015 10 days in 2016 5 days in 2017 13 days in 2018 and average 13 days during 2014 2018 against the bi treatment fig 11 this is caused by the higher daily temperature and less water stress under the di treatment compared to the bi treatment yuan et al 2003 mendelsohn and dinar 2003 hou et al 2010 qin et al 2016 thus the di treatment decreased evaporation accelerated crop growth and shortened the crop growth period though the daily average transpiration under the di treatment may enhance et during the whole crop growth period can reduce compared with that under the bi treatment 4 2 why was edi etdi lower than ebi etbi during the whole growth stage previous studies find that different irrigation methods significantly influenced the ratio of soil evaporation to evapotranspiration zegada and berliner 2011 zhang et al 2013 martins et al 2013 many researchers investigated e et under traditional irrigation and reported that e et might vary from 30 60 yunusa et al 1997 sánchez et al 2015 trout and dejonge 2017 valentín et al 2020 our results find that e et under the di treatment varied from 18 to 23 and under the bi treatment was 20 31 this is similar with the study of li and ma 2019 and rodrigues et al 2013 who reported e accounted for 15 24 of the maize et under di the di treatment reduced by 0 8 in 2014 12 4 in 2015 1 1 in 2016 1 5 in 2017 4 4 in 2018 and average 4 during the five years the results showed the di treatment can improve the components ratio of et previous studies show that the rate of water loss water leaching and e under bi can exceed 40 liu et al 2017a zheng et al 2017 compared to about 13 under di liu et al 2017b umair et al 2019 meanwhile our study suggested that the di treatment reduced e during the whole crop growth period compared with bi though et may decrease at the same time the reduction of evaporation was greater than that of evapotranspiration in addition as the di treatment accelerated crop growth it had higher leaf area index values to capture radiation and larger daily average transpiration zhang et al 2020 when compared with the bi treatment the higher leaf area index may result in the higher surface canopy coverage which was also attributable to the reduction in evaporation 5 conclusion based on the continuous flux measurements over the drip irrigated and border irrigated maize fields we confirmed that the drip irrigation can averagely decrease soil evaporation by 30 mm and 23 shorten the growth days by 13 days and 9 compared with the traditional border irrigation on a five year and regional scale these resulted in a 7 reduction in total evapotranspiration under drip irrigation here we provide an important scientific basis to explain the effects of drip irrigation on crop growth and its water saving mechanism under real field conditions over a 5 year period with a clear advantage in crop growth drip irrigation under mulch is anticipated to be more extensively applied in nw china and other similar regions in the world declaration of competing interest author declares that no financial interest personal relationship is considered a potential competitive advantage acknowledgements we greatly appreciate the careful and precise reviews from the anonymous reviewers who made
