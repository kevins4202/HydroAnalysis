university of science and technology wuhan 430081 pr china this manuscript was handled by c corradini editor in chief with the assistance of okke batelaan associate editor the relative permeability versus saturation relation is fundamental for modeling unsaturated flow processes in aperture based fractures on the basis of the local cubic law and the connectivity probability of aperture distribution within single fractures an analytical relationship between the relative permeability and saturation is established when the van genuchten function on the description of the capillary pressure saturation relationship is applied an explicit mathematical expression between the relative permeability and saturation is gained similar to the form of the van genuchten mualem vg m model of porous media through the comparisons between the several series of laboratory measured data available in the literature and theoretical results good agreements are both presented and they suggest that the proposed vg m model can be successfully used for aperture based fractures as well as porous media to understand aperture variation dependence of the relative permeability properties a computational method combining fractal theory and the invasion percolation model to determine the empirical parameters associated with the spatial correlation of aperture distribution is developed simulated fractures with spatially correlated and uncorrelated aperture distributions corresponding respectively to small and large fractal dimensions are both studied according to the simulated results the residual saturation generally increases with fractal dimension increments however the value of m exhibits a weak dependence on fractal dimension the proposed model can be applied to various engineering such as seepage control for rock slopes petroleum reservoirs nuclear waste disposal and geologic storage of carbon dioxide keywords rock fracture van genuchten mualem model relative permeability aperture variation 1 introduction study of the properties of unsaturated flow through fractured rock is of great significance for many practical applications including seepage control for rock slopes ye et al 2017a b 2018 petroleum reservoirs li et al 2017 dejam et al 2014 2018 nuclear waste disposal faoro et al 2016 and geologic storage of carbon dioxide chang et al 2017 dejam and hassanzadeh 2018 prediction of the relative permeability is fundamental in modeling of multiphase flow in these fractured reservoirs due to the lower permeability of the surrounding matrix water flow through the vadoze zone in fractured rock is dominated by fractures with high permeability dejam et al 2017 accordingly it is required to estimate the relative permeability k r of single fractures in fracture dominated low matrix permeability systems in general rough walled fractures in fractured rock are conceptualized with a smooth parallel two plate model and single phase flow for incompressible fluids in such models is described by the famous cubic law which is validated by theoretical analysis and experimental studies snow 1965 louis 1969 witherspoon et al 1980 from a viewpoint two phase flow through fractures occurs naturally in subsurface flow systems wherein two fluid phases can flow simultaneously in the void space of rock fractures due to interference between the two fluid phases the relative permeability function is employed to describe the permeability reduction in fractures based on an extension of darcy s law the most simplified k r curve the x model was proposed by romm 1966 in which the sum of k r was one while the interference between the two fluid phase was assumed negligible however deviations between experiment and x model predicted relative permeability are particularly severe at intermediate saturations merrill 1975 pieters and graves 1994 fourar et al 1993 persoff and pruess 1995 experimental studies performed on both natural and artificial fractures reported non linear dependence of saturation on relative permeability as a result several well known parametric non linear models including the viscous coupling vc model fourar and lenormand 1998 corey model corey 1954 and van genuchten mualem vg m model mualem 1976 were established for unsaturated porous media as presented in table 1 they have been directly borrowed to predict the k r curves in rough walled fractures based on a geometric similarity assumption between the individual rock fractures and pores in porous media in reality the unsaturated flow path through fractures is different from that through pores recently chen et al 2013 improved the conventional relative permeability model for coal with consideration of matchstick geometry instead of the bundle of capillary tubes but this model was not applied in fractures watanabe et al 2015 have conducted two phase flow experiments and simulations on real fractures with variable apertures the relative permeability of wetting phase was presented as a corey form and a new v type curve was proposed saboorian jooybari 2016 combined basic fluid flow equations and derived a new analytical model to calculate gas liquid relative permeabilities through fractures ye et al 2017a b have developed closed form relative permeability relationships based on the microscopic and macroscopic approaches and discussed the limitations of the existing k r models however these k r models are mostly established on the basis of porous media their usefulness for rough walled fractures have not been rigorously proved in theory i e whether the mualem model mualem 1976 is valid to predict the k r properties of the aperture based fractures is questioned on account of the geometric difference between the fractures and pores in addition determination of the empirical parameters in these k r models is not presented quantitatively and the relationships between the relative permeability properties and aperture variation are still lacking in current literature studies therefore the primary objectives of this study are 1 to develop an analytical model of the relative permeability saturation relationship in aperture based fractures assess its validity with existing experimental data in synthetic and natural fractures and 2 to quantify the relationships between the uncertain parameters in the proposed model and aperture variation of fractures this study is organized as follows in section 2 the analytical model of relative permeability is developed in section 3 comparisons between the proposed model and experimental data are presented and the validity of the proposed model is verified in section 4 the relationships between the uncertain parameters in the proposed model and aperture variation of fractures are investigated through numerical simulations 2 analytical model of relative permeability the behavior of unsaturated fluid flow in single fractures is mainly dependent on the distribution of void space between the upper and lower surfaces and the size of the void space is usually expressed by the value of aperture b for simplicity the water air flow process in fractures is considered in this section while the results here can be extended to other two phase flow systems from the young laplace equation a single fracture element of aperture b is related to the capillary pressure p c as 1 b 2 t s cos α p c where t s is the surface tension between water and air and α is the contact angle for a specified unsaturated water air flow system both t s and α are treated as constant therefore the fracture elements with apertures equal or less than b are occupied by water and the rest by air letting f b be the probability density function of the aperture distribution as shown in fig 1 the volumetric water content θ of the wetting phase can be related to the aperture size based on the fact that the contribution of water filled fracture elements with apertures between b and b db is 2 b f b d b d θ integrating eq 2 we have 3 θ b min b bf b d b where bmin is the minimum aperture value of the fracture elements filled with water in general the water flow is conceptualized as a group of capillary tubes each with a uniform aperture however the flow paths in fractures consist of fracture elements with different apertures based on mualem s statistical model mualem 1976 as shown in fig 1 according to mualem s statistical model a fractured slab of thickness δx x x δx along the axis is considered and the fracture aperture distributions at the two parallel cross sections are assumed to be identical it is supposed that the aperture sizes of the two slab faces are completely randomly distributed and have no spatially correlation the probability of fractures with apertures b 1 b 1 db 1 at x encountering fractures of apertures b 2 b 2 db 2 at x δx yields 4 a b 1 b 2 f b 1 f b 2 d b 1 d b 2 when the connected fracture elements along x x δx are treated as rectangle tubes based on the cubic law the water flux through capillary tubes is given by 5 dq d ϕ dx b 3 a b 1 b 2 where ϕ is the total water head b 2 is the effective aperture for the capillary tube with aperture b 1 at x and the fracture with aperture b 2 at x δx see appendix a the detailed analytical solution to the above equation is presented in appendix b and it yields 6 k r s e 0 s e d s e p c 1 2 0 1 d s e p c 1 2 2 note that in the mualem s model for porous media the exponent of pc is 1 7 k r s e 0 s e d s e p c 0 1 d s e p c 2 to solve the eq 6 an expression relating the effective saturation to the capillary pressure is required there are different functional forms for capillary pressure in fractured porous media including brooks and corey 1964 van genuchten 1980 and many other models fredlund and xing 1994 dindoruk and firoozabadi 1995 both brooks corey and van genuchten relations between capillary pressure and saturation are found to be useful in representing experimental measurements in fractures the measured capillary pressure curves for a rough walled fracture under different states of normal stress performed by reitsma and kueper 1994 were well represented by brooks corey model in order to study the water retention capability at low suctions for rough fractures with randomly aperture distributions a experimental water retention apparatus was designed by wang et al 2013 to measure the relationship between capillary pressure and saturation the van genuchten model could simulate the measured water retention curves for the rough fracture well based on the study on the formation of liquid bridges between porous matrix blocks dejam and hassanzadeh 2011 both brooks corey and van genuchten models have been applied to investigate the interplay of fracture capillary pressure and the block to block interaction process these two models presented consistent trend for the relation between the critical length of liquid element and the threshold bond number at various fracture oil saturations however the brooks corey model cannot represent the gradual and smooth variation of capillary pressure for a saturation close to one van genuchten and nielsen 1985 liu and bodvarsson 2001 in this study a function of effective saturation with respect to capillary pressure proposed by van genuchten 1980 is adopted 8 s e 1 α vg p c n m where m n and αvg are empirical coefficients the first two parameters are measures of the aperture size distribution and the last one is a measure of the largest aperture size or the air entry capillary pressure inserting eq 8 into eq 6 gives 9 k r s e f s e f 1 2 where 10 f s e 0 s e x 1 m 1 x 1 m 1 2 n d x substituting x y m into eq 10 leads to 11 f s e m 0 s e 1 m y m 1 1 2 n 1 y 1 2 n d y in a general case the analytical solution to eq 11 that represents a particular form of the incomplete beta function is difficult to be derived however for a special case with m 1 1 2 n integration of eq 11 gives 12 f s e 1 1 s e 1 m m m 1 1 2 n then eq 9 can be expressed as 13 k r s e 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 m 1 1 2 n 0 m 1 taking a relatively simple form the proposed model does not introduce any additional parameters and the relative permeability function involves only two parameters m and s r an interesting analogue of our development is the relationship between relative permeability and effective saturation in the porous media as shown in table 2 even though the mathematical expressions for the relative permeabilities in the single fractures and porous media are considerably different the final forms are similar for the unsaturated flow in these two media except the empirical parameter m as seen in table 2 3 verification of the proposed relative permeability relationship in order to assess the validity of the relative permeability relationship experimental data from different sources were used to test whether the proposed relationship can match the data experimental results reported in the literature diomampo 2001 chen et al 2004 watanabe et al 2015 2017 were employed for validation studies of the proposed model the two phase flow experiments were conducted on both man made natural homogeneously rough and randomly rough fractures for comparison predictions of the x v c and corey models are also illustrated 3 1 man made fracture experiments the measured dataset presented by diomampo 2001 was adopted to examine the validity of the vg m model in single fractures in which two phase flow experiments in smooth and rough walled fractures were conducted to obtain the relative permeability and saturation data the smooth walled fracture experiment was carried out by flowing nitrogen and water between glass and aluminum plates while in the rough walled fracture experiment nitrogen water flowed through a wire mesh inserted between glass and aluminum fig 2 demonstrates the comparisons of relative permeability between the experimental data and analytical curves predicated by the vg m model associated with smooth and rough walled fractures the parameters for the fitted curves have different values for the smooth and tough walled fractures as seen in table 3 the relative permeability saturation relationships based on the vg m model are in good agreement with the trend of the experimental data rather than the linear plot of the x model compared to other results the data for both smooth and tough walled fractures are higher than that of the corey model but lower than the x and v c models 3 2 natural fracture experiments watanabe et al 2015 2017 reported comprehensive laboratory measurements for nitrogen water and steam water two phase flow experiments involving natural variable aperture fracture in real rock samples under confining stress such fractures unlike man made fractures having parallel smooth plates have rough walls spatial variations in aperture and asperity contact that leads to highly irregular watanabe et al 2015 herein the test results of nitrogen water and steam water two phase flow experiments in lognormal distributed granite fracture is used to verify the proposed relative permeability saturation relation the experimental data matched with the proposed vg m model are shown in fig 3 the vg m curves are in good agreement with the measured data the prediction of the corey model is also close to the measurements as plotted in fig 3 however the x and v c models without the influence of capillarity still fail to capture the high nonlinearity of relative permeability in natural fractures the estimated parameter values for nitrogen water flow are s r 0 and m 0 72 the parameter values for steam water flow are s r 0 and m 0 74 note that although the different two phase flow experiments were conducted in the same rock sample with identical spatial geometry there is no change for the residual saturation and m watanabe et al 2017 indicated that the residual saturation may rely on the fluid intrinsic permeability but there is no clear relation for the water residual saturation further research based on experimental observations is still needed to investigate the influence of fluid properties on the parameters in the relative permeability saturation relationship 3 3 uncorrelated and correlated fracture experiments to further validate the proposed vg m model in other rough walled fracture experiments the datasets provided by chen and horne 2006 is employed the air water two phase flow experiments were performed in two analog fractures with distinct aperture distributions gaussian distribution including homogeneously rough hr and randomly rough rr fractures the aperture variation of the former does not have spatial correlation whereas that of the latter does through an automated high speed data acquisition system the saturation data are acquired immediately and the relative permeability data are then calculated based on darcy s equation fig 4 shows the relationships between relative permeability and saturation obtained from the test data vg m x v c and corey models unlike the x v c and corey models the fitted m is nearly constant around 0 9 but the s r values for hr and rr fractures are 0 04 and 0 19 respectively the correlated fracture has a better connectivity between apertures and it is more easily to generate the continuous flow paths at low saturation the curve slope of the uncorrelated fracture is generally sharper than that of correlated fracture and the curve form is sensitive to the aperture correlation likewise the performance of the proposed vg m model is much better than x v c and corey models and can properly describe the overall trends for all fracture types and correlations the fitted parameter values for m and s r are given in table 3 the values for the correlation coefficient r2 are above 0 84 and the validity of the proposed vg m model is demonstrated by its consistency with a number of measured datasets therefore the vg m model is quite general and can be applied to fractures as well as porous media it is worth noting that m seems to be independent of the variation of the aperture distribution with the same statistical characteristics conversely the residual saturation may be greatly influenced by the spatial correlation of fracture aperture with no consideration of the viscosity and surface tension phase interference and other factors 4 the effect of aperture variation 4 1 the relative permeability saturation prediction approach from the experimental results the relative permeability and saturation relationship based on the vg m predictive model is aperture structure dependent especially for the water air two phase flow experiments chen and horne 2006 the water residual saturation in the uncorrelated fracture is larger than the result in the correlated fractures however the variation of m is minor to understand the source of these observed unsaturated flow fracture structure behaviors illustrated by the data in the table 3 a numerical approach is applied to determine the role of fracture geometry on the relationship between the aperture variation and the relative permeability due to the self affinity of the fracture geometry the spatially correlated and uncorrelated aperture based fractures can be characterized by the fractal theory lu et al 2003 liu et al 2004 ye et al 2015 hence the correlation of the aperture variation is quantified with fractal dimension d between 2 d 3 for three dimensional fracture space as presented in fig 5 the three dimensional aperture based fracture is generated using the successive random additions approach according to the scaling properties of fractional brownian motion the bottom and top surfaces of the fracture are firstly recursively positioned with respect to a certain fractal dimension d and then the void space between the bottom and top surfaces known as aperture distribution is replaced with a network of lattice the unsaturated flow properties of the fractures are predicted based on the invasion percolation approach developed by wilkinson and willemsen 1983 when the inflow outflow and no flow boundaries are assigned the fracture is initially fully occupied by air then for a specified capillary pressure the sites near the inflow boundary and connected to the phase interface are displaced by water orderly when a steady state with respect to the water air phase distribution is reached after the invasion procedure a series of relative permeability saturation data sets are calculated through the steady flow analysis identical to ye et al 2015 based on the least square method the empirical parameters of the proposed vg m model can be estimated through comparison with the datasets from numerical simulations for each fracture with a certain fractal dimension d 4 2 results and discussions as indicated by pruess and tsang 1990 yang et al 2012 and ye et al 2015 2017a b the flow behavior through a fracture is preponderantly controlled by its spatial distribution of fracture aperture to uncover the direct relationship between the spatial correlation and the relative permeability it is necessary to quantitatively establish the connection between the undetermined parameters m and s r of vg m model and the fractal dimension d in this study of the effect of fracture aperture variation on the relative permeability each of the generated fractures consist of a 200 by 200 lattice grid that is employed to discretize a 0 5 m 0 5 m fracture plane a constant gaussian probability density function with a mean value of u 0 3 mm and a standard deviation of σ 0 05 mm in statistic is used for different correlated fractures in combination with nine fractal dimensions d from 2 2 to 2 8 therefore the statistical parameters are constant but the spatial distribution of the fracture aperture differed for simplicity the images in fig 6 show four representative realizations of the simulated fracture with different fractal dimensions d 2 2 2 4 2 6 and 2 8 respectively in fig 6 red yellow color denotes large aperture and blue green denotes small aperture the aperture distributions with smaller fractal dimension d 2 2 and 2 4 have higher spatial correlations and occur in clusters while the aperture distributions with larger fractal dimension d 2 6 and 2 8 are more randomly scattered with lower spatial correlations the relative permeability saturation results for data fitting are shown in fig 7 which suggests that the predictions given by the vg m model are highly consistent with the numerical simulations the fitted parameters are presented in table 4 and r2 values are both above 0 95 as a result the vg m model is verified through unsaturated flow analysis in correlated and uncorrelated fractures and it is able to describe the relative permeability saturation relation in single fractures the result plotted in fig 7 and table 4 indicate that larger fractal dimension d results in higher residual saturation s r this is because for a higher d corresponding to lower spatial correlation it is more difficult to form a continuous flow path for water invasion leading to larger residual saturation it is worth noting that once again m remain almost unchanged with the fractal dimension d from 2 2 to 2 8 indicating that m has weak sensitivity of the aperture correlations to further analyze the proposed vg m model sensitivity with respect to the spatial correlation of aperture distributions numerous groups of the parameters m and s r in the proposed vg m model can be obtained through the process of data fitting since the fracture aperture generation for a given fractal dimension d may quite different the averaged values of m and s r are computed from 200 simulations to reduce the impact of random generation error as presented in fig 8 the average value of the residual saturation s r matains an upward trend with increasing d and the average value of m does not change noticeably which again suggests that the parameter m is a measure of aperture size distribution and not related to the spatial correlation of aperture distribution the relative permeability and saturation relationship of single fractures have a considerable impact on modeling unsaturated flow process in engineering applications therefore it is required to determine the related parameters in the proposed vg m model here an empirical correlation equation between the residual saturation s r and the fractal dimension is proposed as a simple quadratic polynomial curve as shown in fig 8 as follows 14 s r 0 4137 d 2 1 876 d 2 2553 combining eqs 13 and 14 the relative permeability of single fractures can be predicted by measuring the fracture geometry to determine the residual saturation sr 5 conclusions concerning the relative permeability and saturation relationship of the aperture based fractures an analytical model based on the local cubic law and the connectivity probability of aperture distribution is derived and the relative permeability saturation relationship resembles the van genuchten mualem function in porous media based on the results obtained the following conclusion can be drawn 1 three kinds of experimental data obtained from the literature for relative permeability properties are used to assess the validity of the proposed vg m model results indicate good agreements between theory and measurement for the relative permeability and the vg m relative permeability curves appear to represent the experimental data better than the model x v c and corey models it appears that the vg m model is quite general and can be applied to fractures as well as porous media 2 in order to evaluate the aperture variation dependence of the empirical parameter in the proposed vg m model of single fractures numerous relative permeability saturation datasets are generated by the combining fractal theory with the invasion percolation method this allows one to establish an empirical relationship between the residual saturation and the fractal dimension in addition it is shown that the parameter m is not sensitive to the spatial correlation of aperture based fractures however it is hard to know whether the proposed vg m model can accurately predict the relative permeability of aperture based fractures under field conditions further experimental research is required to improve the accuracy of this model it is can be expected that the relative permeability property can be predicted by measuring the geometry structure of aperture based fractures to determine the uncertain parameter in the proposed model declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest regarding the

university of science and technology wuhan 430081 pr china this manuscript was handled by c corradini editor in chief with the assistance of okke batelaan associate editor the relative permeability versus saturation relation is fundamental for modeling unsaturated flow processes in aperture based fractures on the basis of the local cubic law and the connectivity probability of aperture distribution within single fractures an analytical relationship between the relative permeability and saturation is established when the van genuchten function on the description of the capillary pressure saturation relationship is applied an explicit mathematical expression between the relative permeability and saturation is gained similar to the form of the van genuchten mualem vg m model of porous media through the comparisons between the several series of laboratory measured data available in the literature and theoretical results good agreements are both presented and they suggest that the proposed vg m model can be successfully used for aperture based fractures as well as porous media to understand aperture variation dependence of the relative permeability properties a computational method combining fractal theory and the invasion percolation model to determine the empirical parameters associated with the spatial correlation of aperture distribution is developed simulated fractures with spatially correlated and uncorrelated aperture distributions corresponding respectively to small and large fractal dimensions are both studied according to the simulated results the residual saturation generally increases with fractal dimension increments however the value of m exhibits a weak dependence on fractal dimension the proposed model can be applied to various engineering such as seepage control for rock slopes petroleum reservoirs nuclear waste disposal and geologic storage of carbon dioxide keywords rock fracture van genuchten mualem model relative permeability aperture variation 1 introduction study of the properties of unsaturated flow through fractured rock is of great significance for many practical applications including seepage control for rock slopes ye et al 2017a b 2018 petroleum reservoirs li et al 2017 dejam et al 2014 2018 nuclear waste disposal faoro et al 2016 and geologic storage of carbon dioxide chang et al 2017 dejam and hassanzadeh 2018 prediction of the relative permeability is fundamental in modeling of multiphase flow in these fractured reservoirs due to the lower permeability of the surrounding matrix water flow through the vadoze zone in fractured rock is dominated by fractures with high permeability dejam et al 2017 accordingly it is required to estimate the relative permeability k r of single fractures in fracture dominated low matrix permeability systems in general rough walled fractures in fractured rock are conceptualized with a smooth parallel two plate model and single phase flow for incompressible fluids in such models is described by the famous cubic law which is validated by theoretical analysis and experimental studies snow 1965 louis 1969 witherspoon et al 1980 from a viewpoint two phase flow through fractures occurs naturally in subsurface flow systems wherein two fluid phases can flow simultaneously in the void space of rock fractures due to interference between the two fluid phases the relative permeability function is employed to describe the permeability reduction in fractures based on an extension of darcy s law the most simplified k r curve the x model was proposed by romm 1966 in which the sum of k r was one while the interference between the two fluid phase was assumed negligible however deviations between experiment and x model predicted relative permeability are particularly severe at intermediate saturations merrill 1975 pieters and graves 1994 fourar et al 1993 persoff and pruess 1995 experimental studies performed on both natural and artificial fractures reported non linear dependence of saturation on relative permeability as a result several well known parametric non linear models including the viscous coupling vc model fourar and lenormand 1998 corey model corey 1954 and van genuchten mualem vg m model mualem 1976 were established for unsaturated porous media as presented in table 1 they have been directly borrowed to predict the k r curves in rough walled fractures based on a geometric similarity assumption between the individual rock fractures and pores in porous media in reality the unsaturated flow path through fractures is different from that through pores recently chen et al 2013 improved the conventional relative permeability model for coal with consideration of matchstick geometry instead of the bundle of capillary tubes but this model was not applied in fractures watanabe et al 2015 have conducted two phase flow experiments and simulations on real fractures with variable apertures the relative permeability of wetting phase was presented as a corey form and a new v type curve was proposed saboorian jooybari 2016 combined basic fluid flow equations and derived a new analytical model to calculate gas liquid relative permeabilities through fractures ye et al 2017a b have developed closed form relative permeability relationships based on the microscopic and macroscopic approaches and discussed the limitations of the existing k r models however these k r models are mostly established on the basis of porous media their usefulness for rough walled fractures have not been rigorously proved in theory i e whether the mualem model mualem 1976 is valid to predict the k r properties of the aperture based fractures is questioned on account of the geometric difference between the fractures and pores in addition determination of the empirical parameters in these k r models is not presented quantitatively and the relationships between the relative permeability properties and aperture variation are still lacking in current literature studies therefore the primary objectives of this study are 1 to develop an analytical model of the relative permeability saturation relationship in aperture based fractures assess its validity with existing experimental data in synthetic and natural fractures and 2 to quantify the relationships between the uncertain parameters in the proposed model and aperture variation of fractures this study is organized as follows in section 2 the analytical model of relative permeability is developed in section 3 comparisons between the proposed model and experimental data are presented and the validity of the proposed model is verified in section 4 the relationships between the uncertain parameters in the proposed model and aperture variation of fractures are investigated through numerical simulations 2 analytical model of relative permeability the behavior of unsaturated fluid flow in single fractures is mainly dependent on the distribution of void space between the upper and lower surfaces and the size of the void space is usually expressed by the value of aperture b for simplicity the water air flow process in fractures is considered in this section while the results here can be extended to other two phase flow systems from the young laplace equation a single fracture element of aperture b is related to the capillary pressure p c as 1 b 2 t s cos α p c where t s is the surface tension between water and air and α is the contact angle for a specified unsaturated water air flow system both t s and α are treated as constant therefore the fracture elements with apertures equal or less than b are occupied by water and the rest by air letting f b be the probability density function of the aperture distribution as shown in fig 1 the volumetric water content θ of the wetting phase can be related to the aperture size based on the fact that the contribution of water filled fracture elements with apertures between b and b db is 2 b f b d b d θ integrating eq 2 we have 3 θ b min b bf b d b where bmin is the minimum aperture value of the fracture elements filled with water in general the water flow is conceptualized as a group of capillary tubes each with a uniform aperture however the flow paths in fractures consist of fracture elements with different apertures based on mualem s statistical model mualem 1976 as shown in fig 1 according to mualem s statistical model a fractured slab of thickness δx x x δx along the axis is considered and the fracture aperture distributions at the two parallel cross sections are assumed to be identical it is supposed that the aperture sizes of the two slab faces are completely randomly distributed and have no spatially correlation the probability of fractures with apertures b 1 b 1 db 1 at x encountering fractures of apertures b 2 b 2 db 2 at x δx yields 4 a b 1 b 2 f b 1 f b 2 d b 1 d b 2 when the connected fracture elements along x x δx are treated as rectangle tubes based on the cubic law the water flux through capillary tubes is given by 5 dq d ϕ dx b 3 a b 1 b 2 where ϕ is the total water head b 2 is the effective aperture for the capillary tube with aperture b 1 at x and the fracture with aperture b 2 at x δx see appendix a the detailed analytical solution to the above equation is presented in appendix b and it yields 6 k r s e 0 s e d s e p c 1 2 0 1 d s e p c 1 2 2 note that in the mualem s model for porous media the exponent of pc is 1 7 k r s e 0 s e d s e p c 0 1 d s e p c 2 to solve the eq 6 an expression relating the effective saturation to the capillary pressure is required there are different functional forms for capillary pressure in fractured porous media including brooks and corey 1964 van genuchten 1980 and many other models fredlund and xing 1994 dindoruk and firoozabadi 1995 both brooks corey and van genuchten relations between capillary pressure and saturation are found to be useful in representing experimental measurements in fractures the measured capillary pressure curves for a rough walled fracture under different states of normal stress performed by reitsma and kueper 1994 were well represented by brooks corey model in order to study the water retention capability at low suctions for rough fractures with randomly aperture distributions a experimental water retention apparatus was designed by wang et al 2013 to measure the relationship between capillary pressure and saturation the van genuchten model could simulate the measured water retention curves for the rough fracture well based on the study on the formation of liquid bridges between porous matrix blocks dejam and hassanzadeh 2011 both brooks corey and van genuchten models have been applied to investigate the interplay of fracture capillary pressure and the block to block interaction process these two models presented consistent trend for the relation between the critical length of liquid element and the threshold bond number at various fracture oil saturations however the brooks corey model cannot represent the gradual and smooth variation of capillary pressure for a saturation close to one van genuchten and nielsen 1985 liu and bodvarsson 2001 in this study a function of effective saturation with respect to capillary pressure proposed by van genuchten 1980 is adopted 8 s e 1 α vg p c n m where m n and αvg are empirical coefficients the first two parameters are measures of the aperture size distribution and the last one is a measure of the largest aperture size or the air entry capillary pressure inserting eq 8 into eq 6 gives 9 k r s e f s e f 1 2 where 10 f s e 0 s e x 1 m 1 x 1 m 1 2 n d x substituting x y m into eq 10 leads to 11 f s e m 0 s e 1 m y m 1 1 2 n 1 y 1 2 n d y in a general case the analytical solution to eq 11 that represents a particular form of the incomplete beta function is difficult to be derived however for a special case with m 1 1 2 n integration of eq 11 gives 12 f s e 1 1 s e 1 m m m 1 1 2 n then eq 9 can be expressed as 13 k r s e 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 m 1 1 2 n 0 m 1 taking a relatively simple form the proposed model does not introduce any additional parameters and the relative permeability function involves only two parameters m and s r an interesting analogue of our development is the relationship between relative permeability and effective saturation in the porous media as shown in table 2 even though the mathematical expressions for the relative permeabilities in the single fractures and porous media are considerably different the final forms are similar for the unsaturated flow in these two media except the empirical parameter m as seen in table 2 3 verification of the proposed relative permeability relationship in order to assess the validity of the relative permeability relationship experimental data from different sources were used to test whether the proposed relationship can match the data experimental results reported in the literature diomampo 2001 chen et al 2004 watanabe et al 2015 2017 were employed for validation studies of the proposed model the two phase flow experiments were conducted on both man made natural homogeneously rough and randomly rough fractures for comparison predictions of the x v c and corey models are also illustrated 3 1 man made fracture experiments the measured dataset presented by diomampo 2001 was adopted to examine the validity of the vg m model in single fractures in which two phase flow experiments in smooth and rough walled fractures were conducted to obtain the relative permeability and saturation data the smooth walled fracture experiment was carried out by flowing nitrogen and water between glass and aluminum plates while in the rough walled fracture experiment nitrogen water flowed through a wire mesh inserted between glass and aluminum fig 2 demonstrates the comparisons of relative permeability between the experimental data and analytical curves predicated by the vg m model associated with smooth and rough walled fractures the parameters for the fitted curves have different values for the smooth and tough walled fractures as seen in table 3 the relative permeability saturation relationships based on the vg m model are in good agreement with the trend of the experimental data rather than the linear plot of the x model compared to other results the data for both smooth and tough walled fractures are higher than that of the corey model but lower than the x and v c models 3 2 natural fracture experiments watanabe et al 2015 2017 reported comprehensive laboratory measurements for nitrogen water and steam water two phase flow experiments involving natural variable aperture fracture in real rock samples under confining stress such fractures unlike man made fractures having parallel smooth plates have rough walls spatial variations in aperture and asperity contact that leads to highly irregular watanabe et al 2015 herein the test results of nitrogen water and steam water two phase flow experiments in lognormal distributed granite fracture is used to verify the proposed relative permeability saturation relation the experimental data matched with the proposed vg m model are shown in fig 3 the vg m curves are in good agreement with the measured data the prediction of the corey model is also close to the measurements as plotted in fig 3 however the x and v c models without the influence of capillarity still fail to capture the high nonlinearity of relative permeability in natural fractures the estimated parameter values for nitrogen water flow are s r 0 and m 0 72 the parameter values for steam water flow are s r 0 and m 0 74 note that although the different two phase flow experiments were conducted in the same rock sample with identical spatial geometry there is no change for the residual saturation and m watanabe et al 2017 indicated that the residual saturation may rely on the fluid intrinsic permeability but there is no clear relation for the water residual saturation further research based on experimental observations is still needed to investigate the influence of fluid properties on the parameters in the relative permeability saturation relationship 3 3 uncorrelated and correlated fracture experiments to further validate the proposed vg m model in other rough walled fracture experiments the datasets provided by chen and horne 2006 is employed the air water two phase flow experiments were performed in two analog fractures with distinct aperture distributions gaussian distribution including homogeneously rough hr and randomly rough rr fractures the aperture variation of the former does not have spatial correlation whereas that of the latter does through an automated high speed data acquisition system the saturation data are acquired immediately and the relative permeability data are then calculated based on darcy s equation fig 4 shows the relationships between relative permeability and saturation obtained from the test data vg m x v c and corey models unlike the x v c and corey models the fitted m is nearly constant around 0 9 but the s r values for hr and rr fractures are 0 04 and 0 19 respectively the correlated fracture has a better connectivity between apertures and it is more easily to generate the continuous flow paths at low saturation the curve slope of the uncorrelated fracture is generally sharper than that of correlated fracture and the curve form is sensitive to the aperture correlation likewise the performance of the proposed vg m model is much better than x v c and corey models and can properly describe the overall trends for all fracture types and correlations the fitted parameter values for m and s r are given in table 3 the values for the correlation coefficient r2 are above 0 84 and the validity of the proposed vg m model is demonstrated by its consistency with a number of measured datasets therefore the vg m model is quite general and can be applied to fractures as well as porous media it is worth noting that m seems to be independent of the variation of the aperture distribution with the same statistical characteristics conversely the residual saturation may be greatly influenced by the spatial correlation of fracture aperture with no consideration of the viscosity and surface tension phase interference and other factors 4 the effect of aperture variation 4 1 the relative permeability saturation prediction approach from the experimental results the relative permeability and saturation relationship based on the vg m predictive model is aperture structure dependent especially for the water air two phase flow experiments chen and horne 2006 the water residual saturation in the uncorrelated fracture is larger than the result in the correlated fractures however the variation of m is minor to understand the source of these observed unsaturated flow fracture structure behaviors illustrated by the data in the table 3 a numerical approach is applied to determine the role of fracture geometry on the relationship between the aperture variation and the relative permeability due to the self affinity of the fracture geometry the spatially correlated and uncorrelated aperture based fractures can be characterized by the fractal theory lu et al 2003 liu et al 2004 ye et al 2015 hence the correlation of the aperture variation is quantified with fractal dimension d between 2 d 3 for three dimensional fracture space as presented in fig 5 the three dimensional aperture based fracture is generated using the successive random additions approach according to the scaling properties of fractional brownian motion the bottom and top surfaces of the fracture are firstly recursively positioned with respect to a certain fractal dimension d and then the void space between the bottom and top surfaces known as aperture distribution is replaced with a network of lattice the unsaturated flow properties of the fractures are predicted based on the invasion percolation approach developed by wilkinson and willemsen 1983 when the inflow outflow and no flow boundaries are assigned the fracture is initially fully occupied by air then for a specified capillary pressure the sites near the inflow boundary and connected to the phase interface are displaced by water orderly when a steady state with respect to the water air phase distribution is reached after the invasion procedure a series of relative permeability saturation data sets are calculated through the steady flow analysis identical to ye et al 2015 based on the least square method the empirical parameters of the proposed vg m model can be estimated through comparison with the datasets from numerical simulations for each fracture with a certain fractal dimension d 4 2 results and discussions as indicated by pruess and tsang 1990 yang et al 2012 and ye et al 2015 2017a b the flow behavior through a fracture is preponderantly controlled by its spatial distribution of fracture aperture to uncover the direct relationship between the spatial correlation and the relative permeability it is necessary to quantitatively establish the connection between the undetermined parameters m and s r of vg m model and the fractal dimension d in this study of the effect of fracture aperture variation on the relative permeability each of the generated fractures consist of a 200 by 200 lattice grid that is employed to discretize a 0 5 m 0 5 m fracture plane a constant gaussian probability density function with a mean value of u 0 3 mm and a standard deviation of σ 0 05 mm in statistic is used for different correlated fractures in combination with nine fractal dimensions d from 2 2 to 2 8 therefore the statistical parameters are constant but the spatial distribution of the fracture aperture differed for simplicity the images in fig 6 show four representative realizations of the simulated fracture with different fractal dimensions d 2 2 2 4 2 6 and 2 8 respectively in fig 6 red yellow color denotes large aperture and blue green denotes small aperture the aperture distributions with smaller fractal dimension d 2 2 and 2 4 have higher spatial correlations and occur in clusters while the aperture distributions with larger fractal dimension d 2 6 and 2 8 are more randomly scattered with lower spatial correlations the relative permeability saturation results for data fitting are shown in fig 7 which suggests that the predictions given by the vg m model are highly consistent with the numerical simulations the fitted parameters are presented in table 4 and r2 values are both above 0 95 as a result the vg m model is verified through unsaturated flow analysis in correlated and uncorrelated fractures and it is able to describe the relative permeability saturation relation in single fractures the result plotted in fig 7 and table 4 indicate that larger fractal dimension d results in higher residual saturation s r this is because for a higher d corresponding to lower spatial correlation it is more difficult to form a continuous flow path for water invasion leading to larger residual saturation it is worth noting that once again m remain almost unchanged with the fractal dimension d from 2 2 to 2 8 indicating that m has weak sensitivity of the aperture correlations to further analyze the proposed vg m model sensitivity with respect to the spatial correlation of aperture distributions numerous groups of the parameters m and s r in the proposed vg m model can be obtained through the process of data fitting since the fracture aperture generation for a given fractal dimension d may quite different the averaged values of m and s r are computed from 200 simulations to reduce the impact of random generation error as presented in fig 8 the average value of the residual saturation s r matains an upward trend with increasing d and the average value of m does not change noticeably which again suggests that the parameter m is a measure of aperture size distribution and not related to the spatial correlation of aperture distribution the relative permeability and saturation relationship of single fractures have a considerable impact on modeling unsaturated flow process in engineering applications therefore it is required to determine the related parameters in the proposed vg m model here an empirical correlation equation between the residual saturation s r and the fractal dimension is proposed as a simple quadratic polynomial curve as shown in fig 8 as follows 14 s r 0 4137 d 2 1 876 d 2 2553 combining eqs 13 and 14 the relative permeability of single fractures can be predicted by measuring the fracture geometry to determine the residual saturation sr 5 conclusions concerning the relative permeability and saturation relationship of the aperture based fractures an analytical model based on the local cubic law and the connectivity probability of aperture distribution is derived and the relative permeability saturation relationship resembles the van genuchten mualem function in porous media based on the results obtained the following conclusion can be drawn 1 three kinds of experimental data obtained from the literature for relative permeability properties are used to assess the validity of the proposed vg m model results indicate good agreements between theory and measurement for the relative permeability and the vg m relative permeability curves appear to represent the experimental data better than the model x v c and corey models it appears that the vg m model is quite general and can be applied to fractures as well as porous media 2 in order to evaluate the aperture variation dependence of the empirical parameter in the proposed vg m model of single fractures numerous relative permeability saturation datasets are generated by the combining fractal theory with the invasion percolation method this allows one to establish an empirical relationship between the residual saturation and the fractal dimension in addition it is shown that the parameter m is not sensitive to the spatial correlation of aperture based fractures however it is hard to know whether the proposed vg m model can accurately predict the relative permeability of aperture based fractures under field conditions further experimental research is required to improve the accuracy of this model it is can be expected that the relative permeability property can be predicted by measuring the geometry structure of aperture based fractures to determine the uncertain parameter in the proposed model declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest regarding the

6296,an integrated approach was developed to assess the sustainability origin age evolution and groundwater potential of large fossil aquifers using the mega aquifer system mas area 2 106 km2 in the arabian peninsula as a test site a two step exercise was adopted the sustainability of the mas was first investigated through the analysis of grace data and land surface model lsm outputs then integrated geochemical remote sensing and field studies were conducted to address the age origin hydrogeological setting and evolution of the southern sections of the mas rub al khali aquifer system rakas the area identified from the analysis of grace and lsms as being the most suited for sustainable development analysis of grace and lsms revealed 1 the mas central and northern sections are experiencing high groundwater extraction 6 6 km3 yr and depletion rates 2 8 0 8 km3 yr with minimum balancing potential through aquifer capture processes yet sustainability could be achieved by reducing annual extraction by 2 8 km3 and 2 the mas southern sections rub al khali aquifer system rakas are experiencing low groundwater depletion rates eastern rakas 1 8 1 4 mm yr to steady state conditions western rakas 0 73 1 4 mm yr geochemical remote sensing and field investigations over the rakas revealed 1 the presence of west to east trending drainage networks and large scale groundwater flow systems consistent with a meteoric source precipitation over red sea hills 2 increasing 36cl model ages along groundwater flow directions up to 970 000 years indicating aquifer recharge in wet pleistocene periods 3 progressive depletion in the o and h stable isotopic compositions of aquifers with increasing distance from the red sea hills basement outcrops indicating modest recharge during prevailing dry conditions and 4 the presence of relatively fresh tds 800 2800 mg l and non radioactive 226ra 228ra 0 185 bq kg water in western rakas findings suggest that sustainable agricultural development is achievable at current extraction rates in western rakas and provide a replicable and cost effective model keywords fossil aquifers grace remote sensing geochemistry sustainable utilization saudi arabia 1 introduction the arid and hyperarid deserts of the sahara and the arabian peninsula presently receive minimal precipitation with the exception of the surrounding coastal and mountainous areas half of these deserts receive less than 25 mm of rain per year and the rest receive up to 100 mm yr meigs 1953 however in previous pleistocene wet climatic periods these areas received higher amounts of precipitation that recharged their aquifers geyh 1994 the groundwater in these aquifers is now considered to be fossil yet it has been shown recently that in areas of relatively high precipitation the aquifers receive modern recharge sultan et al 2008 2011 abouelmagd et al 2012 2014 many of these aquifers have been overexploited and are showing serious declines in water levels ahmed et al 2011 2014 sultan et al 2013 2014 mohamed et al 2016 given the paucity of freshwater resources in arid areas it is important to identify locations where and scenarios by which such resources could be managed in a sustainable manner this requires an understanding of an aquifer s hydrologic and geologic setting the origin and evolution of its groundwater and its recharge discharge and depletion rates adopting optimal management strategies including identifying the appropriate locations and rates of groundwater extraction would follow in this study we developed integrated cost effective methodologies to accomplish the tasks outlined above for aquifers in data deficient areas worldwide we first utilize observations from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission to differentiate between areas that are currently being utilized in a sustainable manner from others witnessing excessive extraction and estimate optimum sustainable extraction rates for the overexploited areas the mega aquifer system mas see fig 1 of the arabian peninsula is selected as a test site and can serve as a replicable model for many of the less investigated fossil aquifers in the arid parts of the world grace is a joint mission between the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the german aerospace center deutsches zentrum

al 2016 the low spatial resolution 200 000 km2 schmidt et al 2006 swenson and wahr 2006 famiglietti and rodell 2013 of these datasets limited grace applications to the relatively large but not to the medium and small 100 s 1000 s km2 aquifers alley and konikow 2015 moreover additional processing steps were required to address leakage problems in these solutions the correction of which introduced uncertainties in the data kusche 2007 scanlon et al 2016 the monthly high resolution hexagon tiles 120 km at the equator mass concentration mascon solutions from the center for space research csr save

al 2016 ahmed and abdelmohsen 2018 grace measures the variations in total vertical integrated terrestrial water storage gracetws regardless of the compartment where the water resides we adopted a widely accepted approach to calculate the variations in the compartment of interest namely integration of grace observations with land surface models lsms outputs lsms derived soil moisture storage was subtracted from gracetws to quantify and map spatiotemporal variation in groundwater storage e g voss et al 2013 ahmed et al 2014 2016 mohamed et al 2016 the performance of these lsms varied from one climatic setting to another ahmed et al 2016 scanlon et al 2018 and thus it is important to identify the lsm that performs well under the climatic and hydrologic settings of interest the global land data assimilation system gldas a nasa developed land surface modeling system which performs advanced simulations of climatic and hydrologic variables using field and satellite based observations rodell et al 2004 was selected for this study previous studies over saharan africa have shown that when compared to estimates from other lsms gldas provided more reasonable estimates of soil moisture ahmed et al 2016 and higher and statistically significant correlations between tws estimates from gldas outputs and from grace solutions ahmed et al 2016 better estimates for the gldas derived soil moisture storage were obtained by averaging model soil moisture storages from multiple gldas model versions noah mosaic variable infiltration capacity vic and community land model clm to balance the bias and variance in the individual gldas model outputs voss et al 2013 watkins et al 2015 ahmed and abdelmohsen 2018 a similar approach was adopted in this study grace can measure changes in volume of water but not in its quality alley and konikow 2015 the adopted grace sustainability investigation focuses on the water quantity not its quality and does not address the aquifer s geologic and hydrologic settings and the age origin and history of its groundwater for these reasons we conduct additional integrated studies over the areas within the mas that show promising grace sustainability results the mas underlies most of the vast deserts of the arabian peninsula and is one of the largest aquifer systems in the arid world it occupies 2 106 km2 in the kingdom of saudi arabia and in neighboring iraq jordan oman yemen and the united arab emirates fig 1 this multi layer aquifer crops out at the foothills of the red sea hills in northern central and southern parts of the arabian peninsula and extends at depth towards the arabian gulf figs 1 and 2 the southern sections of the mas underlie the rub al khali rak and are herein referred to as the rub al khali aquifer system rakas the rak is largely uninhabited and undeveloped with the exception of a few settlements at the margins of the desert because of its harsh climatic conditions temperatures 50 c in summer and its largely inaccessible terrain over the past few decades the government of saudi arabia supported an aggressive program for the development of agricultural communities using waters extracted from the mas however a lack of understanding of the origin evolution and magnitude of this major groundwater resource has hindered plans for sustainable development of this aquifer in this study we address 1 the sustainability of the mas through the analysis of grace data and lsm outputs over the arabian peninsula and 2 the age origin hydrogeological setting and evolution of the rakas the area identified from the analysis of grace and lsms as being the most suited for sustainable development the latter task is addressed by using remote sensing topographic hydrogeological field geochemical isotopic and geochronological data the geochemical isotopic and geochronological data are obtained for groundwater samples collected from the rakas during a sampling expedition to the western part of the rak in february 2013 a follow up to an earlier expedition january 2006 that covered the eastern side of the rak sultan et al 2008 the traverses crossed in these two sampling expeditions and the sample locations are shown in fig 1 2 hydrogeology of the mas the precambrian crystalline basement of the arabian shield crops out east of the red sea coastline forming the westernmost margin of the mas the groundwater within the basement rocks are found in fractures or in the alluvial aquifers flooring the wadis that dissect the area the crystalline basement is unconformably overlain by thick sequences of cambrian to recent sedimentary rocks that dip gently and thicken to the east up to 5 km in the vicinity of the arabian gulf fig 2 precipitation over the arabian peninsula is scarce except over the mountainous areas surrounding the rakas average annual precipitation extracted from the 3 h tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm data in years 2002 through 2012 is shown in fig 3 the largest average annual rainfall in the kingdom of saudi arabia is in the southern parts of the red sea hills where annual precipitation averages 500 mm and can reach up to 700 mm fig 3 generally the mas is composed of two major aquifer systems the upper and lower mas the principal aquifers for the former are the wasia biyadh umm er radhuma dammam and for the latter are the wajid and the dhruma minjur aquifers the upper and lower mas are separated by the upper jurassic to lower cretaceous anhydrite aquitard of the hith formation kalbus et al 2011 groundwater in the mas is hosted primarily in sandstone limestone and dolomite formations interbedded by confining shale units these aquifers can be considered as three separate groups 1 paleozoic sandstone aquifers e g wajid aquifer 200 900 m thick and limestone and dolomite aquifers of the khuff formation 250 600 m thick 2 a mesozoic sandstone aquifer e g dhruma minjur 400 m thick biyadh wasia 425 m thick and 3 cenozoic eocene and neogene

the mas are hydraulically connected by subvertical tectonic elements e g faults fractures and folds with high vertical hydraulic conductivity these tectonic elements act as hydraulic conduits and allow cross formation flow between the various aquifers kalbus et al 2011 un escwa and bgr 2013 3 data and methods the spatial distribution of watersheds stream networks recharge areas precipitation and groundwater levels were first investigated for a better understanding of the geologic and hydrogeological setting of the watersheds and aquifers within the arabian peninsula using geologic maps digital elevation data and satellite based precipitation measurements then the temporal variations in the grace derived terrestrial water storage tws and ground water storage gws measurements over the identified watersheds and aquifer systems were examined to identify aquifers areas that are currently exploited in sustainable ways as well as others that are not tws refers to the total vertically integrated water content in an area regardless of the reservoir surface water groundwater soil moisture and wet biomass in which it resides and gws refers to groundwater content lastly detailed geochemical isotopic and geochronological studies were conducted to further test and refine the selected areas that showed promise for sustainable development and to investigate the hydrogeological setting origin evolution and water quality of the aquifer system the datasets used in this investigation are in two categories 1 remote sensing datasets that were applied to the entire arabian peninsula and 2 geochemical isotopic and geochronological data for the rakas 3 1 remote sensing datasets and processing 3 1 1 topography the topographic parameterization topaz program of garbrecht and martz 1995 was used to extract the drainage networks and watershed boundaries from shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation data with 30 m spatial resolution 3 1 2 precipitation two types of satellite based rainfall data were utilized 1 1998 2015 trmm data kummerow et al 1998 huffman et al 2007 at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 with a temporal resolution of three hours and 2 the climate prediction center cpc merged analysis of precipitation cmap which provides 1979 to december 2016 merged rainfall estimates from a variety of satellite and ground based sources spatial resolution 2 5 temporal resolution monthly xie et al 1997 the total monthly rainfall images and the average annual precipitation aap images were generated from each of the cmap and the trmm datasets over the entire mas the cmap dataset was used to compare the precipitation intensity during the investigated grace period 2002 2016 hereafter referred to as grace period to the preceding period 1979 2001 whereas trmm was used to examine the spatial variations in precipitation over areas a b and c during the grace period the rainfall time series were generated by averaging the rainfall rates for all grid points lying within the polygons of interest 3 1 3 landsat landsat 8 provides moderate resolution imagery 15 100 m of earth s land surface in the visible near infrared short wave infrared and thermal infrared wavelength regions roy et al 2014 the normalized differential vegetation index ndvi was calculated rouse et al 1973 higher ndvi values indicate greater densities of vegetation and vice versa using a threshold ndvi value of 0 3 which was validated by visual comparisons with google earth images and visual inspection of the areas of high ndvi areas to identify farmland textures the areas occupied by cultivated land were extracted from landsat 8 imagery acquired in 2014 the groundwater extraction over an area was estimated from the product of the estimated cultivated land area and the average volume of water used to irrigate a unit area 3 1 4 grace the grace mission maps the earth s static and temporal global gravity fields tapley et al 2004 because these temporal variations are largely and directly related to the spatio temporal variations in tws wahr et al 1998 grace mascon solutions were used to measure mass variations over large hydrologic systems e g wouters et al 2014 ahmed et al 2014 2016 mohamed et al 2016 sultan et al 2013 2014 abdelmohsen et al 2019 such as the mas monthly mascon solutions release 05 rl05 save et al 2016 from the center for space research at the university of texas http www csr utexas edu grace were used to estimate the temporal variations in tws over the investigated area for the period april 2002 to june 2016 all mascon solutions including the center for space research solutions applied in this study could be readily utilized in hydrologic applications without 1 any post processing and or filtering or 2 application of any empirical scaling factors save et al 2016 as is the case with other mascon solutions luthcke et al 2013 watkins et al 2015 the secular trend long term trend in grace derived tws data was extracted by simultaneously fitting a trend and a seasonal term to each tws time series errors associated with the calculated trend values were estimated tiwari et al 2009 scanlon et al 2016 1 monthly tws time series were fitted using annual semi annual and trend terms and residuals r1 were calculated 2 the calculated residuals r1 were smoothed using a 13 month moving average to remove the interannual signal a trend was removed and the residuals r2 were estimated 3 the standard deviation of r2 represented the maximum uncertainty amplitude of the measurement error in monthly tws values 4 monte carlo simulations were performed by fitting trends and seasonal terms for many n 10 000 synthetic monthly datasets each with values chosen from a population of gaussian distributed numbers having a standard deviation similar to that of the examined population and the standard deviation of the extracted synthetic trends was interpreted as the trend error for tws σtws the amplitude of the measurement error for each month standard deviation of r2 was calculated from steps 1 2 and 3 whereas the tws trend errors were estimated from step 4 monte carlo simulations grace cannot distinguish between anomalies resulting from different components of tws e g groundwater or soil moisture therefore outputs of lsms were used to remove the non groundwater components soil moisture from grace derived tws data the change in groundwater storage over the mas was extracted using the following equation 1 δ gws δ tws δ sms where δgws and δsms represent the change in groundwater and soil moisture storage respectively because there are no surface water bodies in the study area the change in surface water storage δsws is not included in eq 1 soil moisture was extracted from the gldas model because previous studies over saharan africa have shown that the global land data assimilation system gldas provides more reasonable estimates of soil moisture in arid areas when compared to estimates from other lsms ahmed et al 2016 the gldas model simulates soil moisture through its four models noah mosaic vic and clm each of which has its unique structure and parameters noah has four soil layers mosaic and vic models each has three layers and clm has ten layers rodell et al 2004 dai et al 2003 the soil moisture time series over the investigated areas were calculated by averaging the soil moisture estimates from the four gldas models rodell et al 2004 dai et al 2003 the gldas soil moisture values for each of the four models are weighted by the thickness of the individual layers errors in soil moisture trends σsms were calculated as the standard deviation of the trends computed from the four gldas simulations voss et al 2013 castle et al 2014 the trend errors in gws σgws were calculated by adding in quadrature uncertainties related to gracetws and sms trends eq 2 2 σ gws σ tws 2 σ sms 2 groundwater recharge rates were estimated over the investigated areas using eqs 3 and 4 3 δ gws rn ra qn qa where δgws represents the change in groundwater storage qn and qa represent the natural and anthropogenic discharge respectively and the natural and artificial recharge are represented by rn and ra respectively given that there are no major artificial recharge activities in the study area eq 3 is reduced to 4 rn δ gws qn qa the errors

of the 36cl cl atomic ratio 4 results and discussion 4 1 topography precipitation groundwater head data recharge location and groundwater flow direction major west east trending watersheds and drainage systems collect precipitation over the red sea hills and flow across the arabian peninsula the channeled precipitation can potentially recharge the paleozoic triassic cretaceous and tertiary aquifers where they crop out in the foothills of the red sea hills before any flow reaches the arabian gulf figs 2 and 4 this suggestion is supported by the static head data from 156 aramco wells fig 5 and by the precipitation patterns over the arabian peninsula fig 3 under the rak there is a clear southwest to northeast decrease in static head for wells penetrating the various aquifers fig 5 static water levels decrease from 700 m above mean sea level amsl in the foothills of the red sea hills to 200 m amsl in the central part of the rak and approach sea level near the arabian gulf fig 5 this static head gradient indicates that the recharge of the rakas is largely coming from precipitation over the red sea hills sultan et al 2008 this is also true for the northern parts of the mas brgm 2006 fig 3 shows the average annual precipitation aap over the arabian peninsula precipitation is concentrated over the mountain ranges and or highlands in the west red sea hills east oman mountains and south e g hadramount and dhofar mountains only the cenozoic aquifers crop out at the foothills of the southern and eastern highlands therefore precipitation over these mountains is less likely to recharge aquifers other than those of cenozoic age the highlands in the western parts of the mas generally receive higher amounts of precipitation compared to those in the eastern parts for example the westernmost parts of the rak at the foothills of the red sea hills receive relatively high annual precipitation 77 mm compared to the eastern parts 45 mm fig 3 the alluvial aquifers within the basement complex of the red sea hills and the unconfined sections of the paleozoic wajid aquifer that crops out at the foothills of these mountains figs 1 and 2 are replenished by modern precipitation channeled by ephemeral streams 4 2 aquifer recharge discharge depletion and optimum utilization the extent to which the fossil aquifers of the mas are being utilized in a sustainable manner and whether these aquifers are being supplemented by modern precipitation over the red sea hills was addressed by 1 analyzing the spatial and temporal variations in tws and gws 2 examining recharge estimates over areas of similar settings and 3 examining the variation in stable isotopic compositions of groundwater within and away from the potential recharge areas 4 2 1 trends in the grace data secular trends in grace derived tws were mapped over arabia fig 6 positive negative trends indicate increased decreased tws with time the three areas targeted for agricultural development over the past four to five decades were subjected to more specific grace analysis first order estimates for the area occupied by cultivated land was estimated from satellite imagery areas with high ndvi values and farmland texture the groundwater extraction was calculated from the product of the estimated cultivated land area and the average volume of water used to irrigate a unit area 1 4 m3 m2 yr brgm 2006 the cultivated land and groundwater extraction was estimated for 1 northern and central parts of arabia and of the mas fig 6 area a 0 58 106 km2 cultivated land 4 684 km2 groundwater extraction 6 6 km3 yr 2 eastern parts of the rakas fig 6 area b 0 89 106 km2 cultivated land 871 km2 groundwater extraction 1 2 km3 yr and 3 the western parts of the rakas fig 6 area c 0 22 106 km2 cultivated land 966 km2 groundwater extraction 1 4 km3 yr the estimated groundwater extraction for area a 6 6 km3 yr is similar to the reported extraction rates it was 7 to 8 km3 yr in year 2007 then continued to decline to reach 5 5 6 km3 yr by year 2015 othman et al 2018 the similarity in the estimated and observed extraction for area a gives confidence in the estimated extraction for areas b and c where no reported extraction rates are available for areas a b and c time series were calculated for 1 grace derived tws and 2 gws using gldas derived sms and applying eq 1 fig 7 figs 6 and 7 and table 2 show high depletions in tws over area a 7 2 1 0 mm yr 4 2 0 6 km3 yr and moderate to low depletions over area b 2 9 1 1 mm yr 2 5 1 0 km3 yr and area c 3 0 1 0 mm yr 0 7 0 2 km3 yr the steep negative tws trend observed in area a is attributed to groundwater extraction apparently not fully compensated by recharge this suggestion is supported by the wide distribution of the cultivated land in area a compared to areas b and c and by the high depletion rates in grace derived tws over area a fig 6 an additional factor that could have contributed to the observed tws depletion over area a is the decline in aap precipitation from 121 mm 1979 2001 to 75 mm during the grace period 2002 2016 gldas derived sms trends table 2 were estimated at 2 4 1 0 mm yr 1 4 0 6 km3 yr 1 0 0 8 mm yr 0 9 0 7 km3 yr and 2 3 0 9 mm yr 0 5 0 2 km3 yr for areas a b and c respectively similarly the gws time series fig 7 table 2 reveals high depletion rates for area a 4 8 1 4 mm yr 2 8 0 8 km3 yr low depletions for area b 1 8 1 4 mm yr 1 6 1 2 km3 yr but near steady conditions for area c 0 73 1 4 mm yr 0 2 0 3 km3 yr first order estimates of recharge and associated uncertainties over areas a 6 6 1 4 mm yr 3 8 0 8 km3 yr b 0 0 1 4 mm yr 0 0 1 2 km3 yr and c 5 6 1 4 mm yr 1 2 0 3 km3 yr were calculated using eqs 3 and 5 table 2 these recharge estimates should be considered as minimum values given that the natural discharge is unknown and is considered to be negligible area a lies to the northwest of and is distant 300 1500 km from the prominent oil and gas fields including the ghawar and surrounding fields fig 1 area outlined by blue polygon which produces the bulk of the saudi oil and gas fox and ahlbrandt 2002 an observation that suggests that oil and gas extraction is not the cause of the observed depletion over area a our findings indicate that area a is being over exploited when it comes to groundwater extraction this suggestion is supported by extraction data and by the observed decline in groundwater levels monitoring well data from area a showed a decline in groundwater levels of up to 50 m between years 2002 and 2015 othman et al 2018 until 1980 extraction in the study area was minimal 1 km3 yr and continued to increase until the 1990s and early 2000s after which it leveled off to around 7 to 8 km3 yr by 2007 followed by a decline to approximately 5 6 km3 yr by 2015 othman et al 2018 the difference between the reported extraction rates and the observed depletion rate is here interpreted to indicate partial replenishment of the extracted groundwater by modern precipitation sustainable extraction with the current crop and irrigation arrangements could be achieved if the annual extraction over the investigated period is reduced by the extracted depletion rate 2 8 km3 yr alternatively water intensive crops e g wheat and alfalfa in area a could be replaced by water saving crops e g potato sugar beet that require a fraction of the water used by the water intensive crops areas b and c show a low to near steady gws depletion rate of 1 8 1 4 mm yr to 0 73 1 4 mm yr respectively at the current levels of extraction only the southern parts of the mas i e areas b and c in rakas can be used for development of sustainable agriculture in saudi arabia 4 2 2 recharge estimates in similar hydrogeologic settings the temporal and spatial analyses of global trmm precipitation data 2002 2015 for the rak indicate that the aap over the rak is 51 mm yr and that from the cmap data 1979 2016 is 61 mm yr annual rainfall averaged over 1979 2009 measured at the wadi aldawasser najran and sharurah weather stations within the western part of the rak is 26 1 mm yr 60 1 mm yr and 70 3 mm yr respectively almazroui et al 2012 accurate estimation of the recharge from channel beds is a difficult task we present a first order recharge estimation from the channeled inland drainage system in the western sections of the rakas this estimation is based on comparisons to areas with similar hydrogeologic settings using 1983 1990 field based measurements and a water balance approach abdulrazzak and sorman 1994 and abdulrazzak 1995 estimated transmission losses in the tabalah basin in the southwestern region of saudi arabia at 15 25 of the precipitation volume using a chloride mass balance approach bazuhair and wood 1996 estimated recharge rates as 2 10 of total precipitation in the alluvial aquifers in several wadis along the red sea hills within the asir and hijaz mountains in western arabia similar estimates 10 20 of total precipitation were obtained for the tharad and yalamlam wadis in western saudi arabia subyani 2004 2005 using the same technique using a calibrated catchment based continuous 1998 2007 semi distributed hydrologic model soil water and assessment tool model swat milewski et al 2009 estimated recharge within the major watersheds in the sinai peninsula and the eastern desert of egypt at 15 7 and 21 2 of the aap respectively they attributed recharge solely to transmission losses given earlier findings of 1 minimal 4 of precipitation recharge through initial losses from studies in the arid southwestern united states e g flint et al 2000 the nevada basin dettinger 1989 and western saudi arabia bazuhair and wood 1996 and 2 negligible 4 of infiltration evaporation from channel reaches during flash floods e g abdulrazzak and sorman 1994 ben zvi and shentsis 2001 schwartz 2001 shentsis et al 1999 sorey and matlock 1969 guided by the above mentioned findings in similar geologic and hydrogeologic settings and adopting a recharge rate of 10 of the precipitated volume 16 km3 yr over area c we estimate a recharge of 1 6 km3 yr the estimated recharge is comparable yet exceeds the grace derived recharge rate 1 2 0 3 km3 yr that was calculated using eq 3 as predicted and described earlier the grace derived recharge underestimates recharge given that the natural discharge component is unknown and is here neglected similarly the precipitation derived recharge rate for area a 5 3 km3 yr exceeds the grace derived rates 3 8 0 8 km3 yr the larger discrepancy between the precipitation derived 3 9 km3 yr and the grace derived 0 0 1 2 km3 yr rates for area b is here attributed to extensive discharge which was not accounted for in the grace derived recharge calculations this discharge occurs over extensive areas proximal to the arabian gulf now covered by active sabkhas and salt pans and in the gulf as well sultan et al 2008 kalbus et al 2011 schulz et al 2015 4 3 geochemical data origin history and suitability of rakas in this section we provide geochemical data to address the origin and evolution of groundwater in the rak water quality of the aquifer and its suitability for direct use in either irrigation or as drinking water chlorine 36 calculated model ages are given in table 3 and isotopic analyses including stable isotope ratios of hydrogen and oxygen in water 14c uncalibrated 14c model ages and radium isotope activities are given in table 4 concentrations of cations and anions along with ph and alkalinity are given in table 5 the results are discussed in the following sections with reference to our previous study of groundwater from the eastern portion of the rak sultan et al 2008 we demonstrate that the groundwater hosted in the rakas is largely fossil yet its western sections are receiving modern contributions we also show that the western rak groundwater unlike the eastern rak is characterized by low salinities table 5 acceptable for direct use in irrigation and drinking 4 3 1 14c activities and 36cl abundances in water samples and groundwater residence time 36cl has been used successfully to date very old nubian aquifer groundwater in the western desert of egypt sturchio et al 2004 patterson et al 2005 and may provide useful constraints on groundwater residence times in the rakas an important difference between the rakas and the nubian aquifer however is that the chloride concentration is about 10 times higher in the western rakas groundwater table 5 than in the nubian aquifer groundwater patterson et al 2005 the chloride concentrations in these samples are mostly in the range of 160 570 mg l table 5 which is similar to the range in chloride concentrations of shallow groundwater in water aquifers near jeddah bazuhair and wood 1996 such high chloride concentrations in shallow groundwater most likely reflect evaporation prior to recharge as implied by the chloride mass balance model bazuhair and wood 1996 this may complicate the interpretation of the groundwater ages in the western rak because of in situ nucleogenic production of 36cl within the aquifer which becomes an important consideration where the chloride concentration in groundwater exceeds 100 mg l phillips 2000 the conversion of 36cl cl ratios to a groundwater model age in the absence of subsurface 36cl production or chloride addition is based simply on the radioactive decay of the initial 36cl according to 7 t 1 λ ln r m r i where r m and r i are the measured and initial 36cl cl ratios respectively λ 2 303 10 6 yr is the decay constant of 36cl and t is the mean 36cl model age of the water in years this corresponds to a piston flow model of the aquifer a more realistic age estimate may be obtained when the subsurface secular equilibrium ratio r se is taken into account but no additional subsurface cl is added and in this case the following equation may be used after bentley et al 1986 8 t 1 λ ln r m r se r i r se an r se value of 5 10 15 is assumed as a reasonable estimate for a sandstone aquifer based on the results of patterson et al 2005 the initial value of the 36cl cl ratio is a critical issue in 36cl dating of groundwater because this value varies with geographic location davis et al 1998 phillips 2000 the best fit initial value of 36cl cl for the nubian aquifer is 130 10 15 patterson et al 2005 in the present study our approach is to use the samples with the youngest 14c model ages to constrain the initial 36cl cl ratio because wells eq2 57 and eq2 60 are the shallowest wells sampled total depth of 80 and 60 m respectively in the presumed recharge area of the western rakas samples collected from these wells are assumed to be the youngest the 14c model ages for samples eq2 57 and eq2 60 were found to be 6700 and 8500 years b p and their 36cl cl ratios were in agreement at 61 5 10 15 and 65 5 10 15 respectively the initial 36cl cl ratio in the rak is apparently lower than that in the western desert of egypt this is consistent with the location of the red sea hills and the prevailing storm tracks from the northwest that may import marine aerosols from both the mediterranean and red sea the difference in the 36cl cl ratios of samples eq2 57 and eq2 60 is within the error of the 36cl cl measurement a decrease in this ratio from 65 to 61 can be produced by decay of 36cl in about 30 000 yr virtually the entire range of 14c model ages is within the measurement error of the initial 36cl cl ratio one of the water samples in this study sample eq2 58 yielded a higher measured 36cl cl ratio of 87 7 10 15 this may indicate a range of initial 36cl cl ratios which complicates the interpretation of 36cl data in terms of groundwater residence times however there is a cluster of 36cl cl ratios from 54 10 15 to 65 10 15 in waters from the presumed recharge area at the eastern base of the red sea hills therefore an initial 36cl cl ratio of 65 10 15 is a more conservative assumption and will yield minimum 36cl model ages the 36cl cl ratios of the water samples are compared with their 36cl concentrations in fig 8 there is a general correlation of 36cl cl and 36cl concentration which is consistent with variation in 36cl being caused simply by radioactive decay rather than subsurface production or chloride input fig 8 this supports the validity of 36cl for groundwater dating in this aquifer system table 3 lists 36cl model ages that were calculated from eqs 7 and 8 assuming a value of 65 10 15 for the initial 36cl cl ratio r i and a value of 5 10 15 for the secular equilibrium ratio of 36cl cl r se the resulting ranges in 36cl model ages are from 50 kyr to approximately 1 million yr with a general trend of increasing age with distance from the presumed recharge area in the red sea highlands of western saudi arabia an additional observation is that the 36cl model ages calculated by eq 7 are slightly younger than those calculated by eq 8 in the cases where two samples were collected from the same aquifer at different distances from the recharge area an increase in 36cl model age consistent with an increase in groundwater residence time along the flow path from west to east was observed fig 11 for example wells eq2 60 and eq2 7 tap the upper paleozoic aquifer and their 36cl model ages are 0 50 and 970 kyr respectively the former is drilled within the recharge area and the latter some 200 km away from it eq2 58 and eq2 59 were sampled from wells within the recharge areas of the lower paleozoic aquifer they have similar 36cl model ages of 50 kyr and 30 40 kyr respectively eq2 61 and eq2 5 were sampled from the recharge areas of the jurassic aquifer they too have 36cl model ages eq2 61 90 60 kyr eq2 5 170 70 kyr that are within the measurement uncertainties wells eq2 20 eq2 21 and eq2 23 are located near each other in the eastern portion of the study area in a low relief sand covered area and are tapping water from the eocene aquifer these samples have ages ranging from 420 to 600 kyr and their recharge area is most likely farther to the east than that of the older aquifers fig 2 these eocene aquifer water samples also have the highest δ18o values table 4 of the sampled wells with the exception of the open pit wells the geographic distribution obtained from the 36cl model ages fig 11 is consistent with rakas recharge being largely during pleistocene wet climatic periods and with groundwater flow rates on the order of approximately one meter per year these groundwater ages and flow rates could be verified in the future by 81kr measurements in a groundwater traverse across the region 4 3 2 hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in water samples and groundwater origin and sources the water samples have a wide range in stable isotopic composition with δd values ranging from 76 6 to 13 2 and δ18o values ranging from 10 1 to 0 9 table 4 these data from the western rak are shown in comparison with those from the eastern rak sultan et al 2008 data for modern precipitation in bahrain iaea wmo and data for groundwater from the gulf of suez area sturchio et al 1996 in fig 9 the overall pattern of isotopic compositions for western rak samples resembles that found by sultan et al 2008 for eastern rak samples in the earlier study and in this study the samples from deep wells have isotopic compositions near the meteoric water line and are more depleted in heavy isotopes than modern precipitation over bahrain while resembling those of fossil groundwater from the gulf of suez region samples from shallow open pit wells have isotopic compositions indicative of substantial evaporation if recharge of the rakas is largely from precipitation over the red sea hills one would expect maximum contributions from modern precipitation within recharge areas cropping out at the foothills of the basement complex and decreased contributions with increasing distance from the mountains and or depth of wells this is because our conceptual model calls on recharge from precipitation over the red sea hills that is channeled downslope as runoff and as subsurface flow towards the recharge areas inspection of table 4 and fig 11 shows that indeed this is the case for example a lower paleozoic wajid aquifer sample eq2 58 from a well total depth td 200 m proximal 15 km to the basement complex is enriched δd 32 7 and δ18o 5 1 compared to a sample eq 59 from a deeper 300 m well 24 km away from the basement complex δd 46 8 and δ18o 6 91 this is also true for samples collected from the upper paleozoic wajid eq2 60 and eq2 7 and jurassic eq2 61 and eq2 5 aquifers sample eq2 60 is enriched δd 46 1 and δ18o 5 9 compared to sample eq2 7 δd 76 7 and δ18o 10 1 eq2 60 was collected from a shallow well td 60 m 41 km from the basement whereas eq2 7 was sampled from a deep td 1137 m well 267 km away from the basement similarly eq2 5 is enriched δd 42 9 and δ18o 6 1 compared to eq2 61 δd 64 1 and δ18o 8 5 the former was collected from a 280 m deep well 77 km from the basement whereas the latter came from a deeper well td 450 m well located 105 km from the basement the majority of the samples from the western and eastern rak seem to have a consistent isotopic composition an observation that is also supportive of the proposed recharge sultan et al 2008 of the rakas from precipitation over the red sea hills however a few of the western rak samples have isotopically lighter compositions than any of the eastern rak samples this may indicate recharge of these samples at higher elevations red sea hills during colder climates as compared with the eastern samples which are all sampled from the eocene aquifer 4 3 3 solute concentrations and natural radioactivity in water samples the chemical compositions of the water samples are reported in table 5 the samples all have near neutral ph 7 1 8 3 and relatively low salinities in the range of about 800 to 8000 mg l total dissolved solids tds the two most saline samples are from open pit wells eq2 18 and eq2 22 and these have most likely experienced substantial evaporation as indicated by the stable isotope data discussed below the deep well water samples have tds concentrations in the range of about 800 2800 mg l which is considered reasonably fresh and can be used for irrigation without treatment and possibly for drinking water with minor treatment in contrast most of the water samples analyzed by sultan et al 2008 from the eastern rak have much higher salinity up to 90 000 mg l and would not be acceptable for direct use in either irrigation or for drinking water a comparison of the δ2h values and chloride concentrations mg l for water samples from this study and the eastern rak sultan et al 2008 is shown in fig 10 a also shown in fig 10a are arrows representing two processes affecting the chemical composition alone salt dissolution or both the chemical and isotopic compositions evaporation of the waters hypothetical evaporation of meteoric water beginning at δ2h 50 and chloride concentration 10 mg l does not explain any of the water compositions indicating that solutes are being enriched by dissolution of salts or aquifer rocks for the most saline waters found in the eastern rak it appears that some dissolution of subsurface evaporite formations and or surficial sabkha salts including halite has occurred sultan et al 2008 the western rak samples have relatively low salinity and do not appear to have been affected by evaporite dissolution in the subsurface the most abundant solutes in the waters on a molar basis are sodium na and chloride cl table 5 a diagram of na vs cl concentrations shows that the na cl ratio is fairly constant for all waters over a wide range of salinity fig 10b this is consistent with acquisition of these solutes either by concentration of salts from marine aerosols upon which raindrops may nucleate or from dissolution of halite which may occur as trace salts in arid soils or as evaporite deposits in the subsurface evaporite deposits are known to occur in the lower eocene jurassic and proterozoic hormuz salts formations of saudi arabia dissolution of aquifer rocks also affects groundwater compositions in the rak as discussed by sultan et al 2008 this is demonstrated by a diagram of calcium ca versus sulfate so4 concentrations fig 10c which shows that the ratio ca so4 varies between that in marine aerosols indicated by seawater mixing line and that in gypsum caso4 h2o or anhydrite caso4 both of which occur in several of the formations in the jurassic through eocene stratigraphic sequence of saudi arabia and are likely to be encountered and dissolved along groundwater flow paths the only water samples not showing evidence of caso4 dissolution are those from the eocene aquifer in the eastern part of the study area e g eq2 20 eq2 21 and eq2 23 samples collected from eastern rak could have acquired much of their solutes in the subsurface from interaction with aquifer rocks along their flow paths by ion exchange reactions e g appelo 1994 chapelle and knobel 1983 and by dissolution of evaporites a likely candidate for the solute source is the hormoz series an upper proterozoic sedimentary sequence 2 km thick that underlies all major oil fields in the persian gulf area and surroundings fig 11 it is largely composed of bedded salt gypsum and anhydrite with thick interbedded dolomite shale and sandstone another candidate could be the evaporite beds within the lower eocene rus formation which underlies the productive aquifer of the middle eocene dammam formation a suggestion that is supported by the similarity of the strontium isotopic composition of groundwater to that of the eocene seawater sultan et al 2008 alternatively the deeper groundwater could have ascended through structural discontinuities dissolved evaporative salts and undergone substantial near surface evaporation in groundwater discharge zones sabkhas that are prominent in the eastern sections of rak but absent in the western parts this suggestion is supported by the correspondence between the distribution of the highest salinities in the groundwater data with that of the sabkha outcrops and the hormoz formation at depth fig 11 to conclude the western rak groundwater but not that of the eastern rak has relatively low salinities acceptable for direct use in either irrigation or as drinking water the most abundant radioactive isotopes in many groundwater systems are the radium isotopes 226ra and 228ra these isotopes represent a health hazard if ingested measurements of these isotopes were completed for 10 samples collected from the western rak and most were below the detection limit for 226ra and were also low in 228ra activity only three samples eq2 20 eq2 21 and eq 23 all from the eocene aquifer had ra activities higher than the us epa regulatory limit for drinking water which is 0 185 bq kg combined activity of 226ra 228ra sample 23 has ra activity more than three times the us epa limit these high ra samples are all from the eocene aquifer in the eastern part of the study area suggesting that groundwater from this aquifer may require ra removal before being used for drinking or irrigation based on our preliminary findings the ra isotope activities in the western rak do not seem to pose serious hazard risks with the exception of water taken from the eocene aquifer this supports the earlier suggestion that groundwater from the western rak but not the eastern rak is acceptable for direct use as drinking water or in irrigation 5 findings and implications a two step approach was conducted to assess the sustainability origin age evolution and groundwater potential of large fossil aquifers using the mas as a test site 1 the sustainability of the mas was investigated through the analysis of grace data and lsm outputs and 2 integrated geochemical remote sensing and field studies were conducted to address the age origin hydrogeological setting and evolution of the rakas the area identified from the analysis of grace and lsms as being the most suited for sustainable development data from grace and outputs of the gldas model were used to estimate the depletion rates for the mas and to investigate the sustainability of the aquifer considering the average groundwater extraction rates and the aquifer capture potential to balance groundwater extraction throughout the investigated period our findings indicate that the central and northern parts of the mas area a are experiencing high gws depletion rates 4 8 1 4 mm yr that cannot be balanced by aquifer capture induced by excessive extraction area a is currently being overexploited yet sustainable extraction could be achieved if the average extraction over the investigated period is reduced by up to 2 8 km3 yr the southern parts of the mas are experiencing low gws depletion rates 1 8 1 4 mm yr in area b to steady state 0 7 1 4 in area c at the current levels of extraction the rakas areas b and c could be used in a sustainable manner we demonstrated for the rakas that information pertaining to the sustainability and longevity of aquifers that was extracted from grace and lsms should be complemented by observations from traditional data sources for a better understanding of the origin evolution and hydrogeological setting of the investigated aquifer and the quality of its waters although we believe that the rak aquifers are largely formed of fossil water as much as 750 1000 kyr old as indicated by their 36cl model ages we suggest that during the intervening dry periods as is the case now these aquifers must receive additional recharge given 1 the relatively high precipitation over the red sea hills 2 the presence of a network of ephemeral streams that can channel these waters to the recharge areas at the foothills of these mountains and 3 the isotopic composition of groundwater that shows evidence of increased mixing with modern precipitation at shallow depths within recharge areas proximal to the basement complex not only is the western rak receiving substantial modern recharge but its water quality may be adequate for a variety of agricultural and domestic uses the western rak samples have relatively low salinity that is acceptable for direct use in either irrigation or as drinking water and the ra isotope activities do not appear to pose serious hazard risks the example provided here represents a straightforward demonstration for the potential use of grace data for the development of sustainable extraction scenarios for aquifers in arid environments world wide if the focus was on the quantity of water alone the proposed method assumes that aquifers approach near steady conditions with time yet aquifer depletions can occur in gws as a result of excessive extraction and or diminished recharge conditions related to climate change we propose that regardless of the cause s of aquifer depletion sustainable extraction could be attained by reducing the current extraction rates by the estimated depletion rates in gws over areas of interest and that the proposed reductions will cancel out the estimated gws depletions the advocated method is especially useful for the less investigated aquifers that lack the data required by the methods currently being used in the evaluation of aquifer sustainability such as recharge discharge and extraction rates and temporal precipitation and water level datasets examples of methods used in the evaluation of aquifer sustainability include groundwater flow models and the groundwater footprint gf method the construction and calibration of many of the groundwater flow models requires extensive monitoring networks and archival records of precipitation and head data the groundwater footprint method gleeson et al 2016 requires knowledge of annual abstraction and recharge rates and the groundwater contribution to environmental streamflow such datasets are often missing for many of the world s fossil aquifer systems the gf method defines the area required to sustain groundwater use and groundwater dependent ecosystem services of a region of interest the proposed grace based methodology has its own limitations as well the method assumes that for area a groundwater extraction cannot be balanced by capture new equilibrium will not be attained and aquifer depletion would continue while this is probably true for area a within the mas and for large sectors of similar fossil aquifers worldwide they are not accurate for aquifers receiving considerable modern recharge for such aquifers the estimated reductions in extraction to achieve sustainable utilization of the aquifer will be overestimated and should be considered as an upper limit the change in the grace derived groundwater storage over the grace period was used as the basis for judging the sustainability of the arabian aquifer systems in doing so one hopes that the mass variations that are related to semi annual annual multi annual and decadal climatic cycles are represented in the examined grace record while the semi annual annual and multi annual cycles are likely to be represented in the available grace records and in the solutions that we derived the decadal cycles might not be given the short grace operational period 14 5 years the acquisition of twsgrace data over the upcoming years by the grace fo may 2018 with a nominal expected lifetime of 5 10 years and grace ii planned in 2025 with a nominal expected lifetime of 5 10 years missions will in part address these limitations by enabling the acquisition of continuous and lengthy twsgrace records the spatial resolution of grace data is coarse 1 1 and the proposed methodologies cannot be applied to small 120 120 km areas save et al 2016 as described earlier the current extraction rate for area a should be reduced by 2 8 km3 yr to reach sustainable extraction but no reductions are required for areas b and c the proposed reductions in extraction amounts should take into account the uncertainties associated with the estimation of the depletion rates if they were considered for area a reductions in extraction would range from 2 0 3 4 km3 yr in addition there is a need to refine those estimates as the grace temporal record increases with time the advocated grace sustainability approach focuses on the quantity but not the quality of groundwater and does not advance our understanding of the geologic and hydrologic setting of the aquifer and the age origin and history of its groundwater for these reasons additional integrated field isotopic geochemical and geochronological studies similar to those presented for the rak should be conducted in areas that show promising grace sustainability results investigating the sustainability of aquifers under current natural and anthropogenic discharge rates determining the quantity of modern recharge the quality of water and the age and evolution of aquifers are all significant and complementary steps towards the development of sound sustainable water management programs for aquifers in general and fossil aquifers such as the mas in particular the proposed techniques should not be considered as alternatives to the development of comprehensive calibrated groundwater flow models but possibly as complementary measurements

6296,an integrated approach was developed to assess the sustainability origin age evolution and groundwater potential of large fossil aquifers using the mega aquifer system mas area 2 106 km2 in the arabian peninsula as a test site a two step exercise was adopted the sustainability of the mas was first investigated through the analysis of grace data and land surface model lsm outputs then integrated geochemical remote sensing and field studies were conducted to address the age origin hydrogeological setting and evolution of the southern sections of the mas rub al khali aquifer system rakas the area identified from the analysis of grace and lsms as being the most suited for sustainable development analysis of grace and lsms revealed 1 the mas central and northern sections are experiencing high groundwater extraction 6 6 km3 yr and depletion rates 2 8 0 8 km3 yr with minimum balancing potential through aquifer capture processes yet sustainability could be achieved by reducing annual extraction by 2 8 km3 and 2 the mas southern sections rub al khali aquifer system rakas are experiencing low groundwater depletion rates eastern rakas 1 8 1 4 mm yr to steady state

sustainable utilization saudi arabia 1 introduction the arid and hyperarid deserts of the sahara and the arabian peninsula presently receive minimal precipitation with the exception of the surrounding coastal and mountainous areas half of these deserts receive less than 25 mm of rain per year and the rest receive up to 100 mm yr meigs 1953 however in previous pleistocene wet climatic periods these areas received higher amounts of precipitation that recharged their aquifers geyh 1994 the groundwater in these aquifers is now considered to be fossil yet it has been shown recently that in areas of relatively high precipitation the aquifers receive modern recharge sultan et al 2008 2011 abouelmagd et al 2012 2014 many of these aquifers have been overexploited and are showing serious declines in water levels ahmed et al 2011 2014 sultan et al 2013 2014 mohamed et al 2016 given the paucity of freshwater resources in arid areas it is important to identify locations where and scenarios by which such resources could be managed in a sustainable manner this requires an understanding of an aquifer s hydrologic and geologic setting the origin and evolution of its groundwater and its recharge discharge and depletion rates adopting optimal management strategies including identifying the appropriate locations and rates of groundwater extraction would follow in this study we developed integrated cost effective methodologies to accomplish the tasks outlined above for aquifers in data deficient areas worldwide we first utilize observations from the gravity recovery and climate

of water but not in its quality alley and konikow 2015 the adopted grace sustainability investigation focuses on the water quantity not its quality and does not address the aquifer s geologic and hydrologic settings and the age origin and history of its groundwater for these reasons we conduct additional integrated studies over the areas within the mas that show promising grace sustainability results the mas underlies most of the vast deserts of the arabian peninsula and is one of the largest aquifer systems in the arid world it occupies 2 106 km2 in the kingdom of saudi arabia and in neighboring iraq jordan oman yemen and the united arab emirates fig 1 this multi layer aquifer crops out at the foothills of the red sea hills in northern central and southern parts of the arabian peninsula and extends at depth towards the arabian gulf figs 1 and 2 the southern sections of the mas underlie the rub al khali rak and are herein referred to as the rub al khali aquifer system rakas the rak is largely uninhabited and undeveloped with the exception of a few settlements at the margins of the desert because of its harsh climatic conditions temperatures 50 c in summer and its largely inaccessible terrain over the past few decades the government of saudi arabia supported an aggressive program for the development of agricultural communities using waters extracted from the mas however a lack of understanding of the origin evolution and magnitude of this major groundwater resource has hindered plans for sustainable development of this aquifer in this study we address 1 the sustainability of the mas through the analysis of grace data and lsm outputs over the arabian peninsula and 2 the age origin hydrogeological setting and evolution of the rakas the area identified from the analysis of grace and lsms as being the most suited for sustainable development the latter task is addressed by using remote sensing topographic hydrogeological field geochemical isotopic and geochronological data the geochemical isotopic and geochronological data are obtained for groundwater samples collected from the rakas during a sampling expedition to the western part of the rak in february 2013 a follow up to an earlier expedition january 2006 that covered the eastern side of the rak sultan et al 2008 the traverses crossed in these two sampling expeditions and the sample locations are shown in fig 1 2 hydrogeology of the mas the precambrian crystalline basement of the arabian shield crops out east of the red sea coastline forming the westernmost margin of the mas the groundwater within the basement rocks are found in fractures or in the alluvial aquifers flooring the wadis that dissect the area the crystalline basement is unconformably overlain by thick sequences of cambrian to recent sedimentary rocks that dip gently and thicken to the east up to 5 km in the vicinity of the arabian gulf fig 2 precipitation over the arabian peninsula is scarce except over the mountainous areas surrounding the rakas average annual precipitation extracted from the 3 h tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm data in years 2002 through 2012 is shown in fig 3 the largest average annual rainfall in the kingdom of saudi arabia is in the southern parts of the red sea hills where annual precipitation averages 500 mm and can reach up to 700 mm fig 3 generally the mas is composed of two major aquifer systems the upper and lower mas the principal aquifers for the former are the wasia biyadh umm er radhuma dammam and for the latter are the wajid and the dhruma minjur aquifers the upper and lower mas are separated by the upper jurassic to lower cretaceous anhydrite aquitard of the hith formation kalbus et al 2011 groundwater in the mas is hosted primarily in sandstone limestone and dolomite formations interbedded by confining shale units these aquifers can be considered as three separate groups 1 paleozoic sandstone aquifers e g wajid aquifer 200 900 m thick and limestone and dolomite aquifers of the khuff formation 250 600 m thick 2 a mesozoic sandstone aquifer e g dhruma minjur 400 m thick biyadh wasia 425 m thick and 3 cenozoic eocene and neogene limestone and dolomite aquifers e g umm er radhuma 250 700 m thick dammam 250 m thick al alawi and abdulrazzak 1994 alsharhan et al 2001 ministry for higher education 2000 the various aquifers within the mas are hydraulically connected by subvertical tectonic elements e g faults fractures and folds with high vertical hydraulic conductivity these tectonic elements act as hydraulic conduits and allow cross formation flow between the various aquifers kalbus et al 2011 un escwa and bgr 2013 3 data and methods the spatial distribution of watersheds stream networks recharge areas precipitation and groundwater levels were first investigated for a better understanding of the geologic and hydrogeological setting of the watersheds and aquifers within the arabian peninsula using geologic maps digital elevation data and satellite based precipitation measurements then the temporal variations in the grace derived terrestrial water storage tws and ground water storage gws measurements over the identified watersheds and aquifer systems were examined to identify aquifers areas that are currently exploited in sustainable ways as well as others that are not tws refers to the total vertically integrated water content in an area regardless of the reservoir surface water groundwater soil moisture and wet biomass in which it resides and gws refers to groundwater content lastly detailed geochemical isotopic and geochronological studies were conducted to further test and refine the selected areas that showed promise for sustainable development and to investigate the hydrogeological setting origin evolution and water quality of the aquifer system the datasets used in this investigation are in two categories 1 remote sensing datasets that were applied to the entire arabian peninsula and 2 geochemical isotopic and geochronological data for the rakas 3 1 remote sensing datasets and processing 3 1 1 topography the topographic parameterization topaz program of garbrecht and martz 1995 was used to extract the drainage networks and watershed boundaries from shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation data with 30 m spatial resolution 3 1 2 precipitation two types of satellite based rainfall data were utilized 1 1998 2015 trmm data kummerow et al 1998 huffman et al 2007 at a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 with a temporal resolution of three hours and 2 the climate prediction center cpc merged analysis of precipitation cmap which provides 1979 to december 2016 merged rainfall estimates from a variety of satellite and ground based sources spatial resolution 2 5 temporal resolution monthly xie et al 1997 the total monthly rainfall images and the average annual precipitation aap images were generated from each of the cmap and the trmm datasets over the entire mas the cmap dataset was used to compare the precipitation intensity during the investigated grace period 2002 2016 hereafter referred to as grace period to the preceding period 1979 2001 whereas trmm was used to examine the spatial variations in precipitation over areas a b and c during the grace period the rainfall time series were generated by averaging the rainfall rates for all grid points lying within the polygons of interest 3 1 3 landsat landsat 8 provides moderate resolution imagery 15 100 m of earth s land surface in the visible near infrared short wave infrared and thermal infrared wavelength regions roy et al 2014 the normalized differential vegetation index ndvi was calculated rouse et al 1973 higher ndvi values indicate greater densities of vegetation and vice versa using a threshold ndvi value of 0 3 which was validated by visual comparisons with google earth images and visual inspection of the areas of high ndvi areas to identify farmland textures the areas occupied by cultivated land were extracted from landsat 8 imagery acquired in 2014 the groundwater extraction over an area was estimated from the product of the estimated cultivated land area and the average volume of water used to irrigate a unit area 3 1 4 grace the grace mission maps the earth s static and temporal global gravity fields tapley et al 2004 because these temporal variations are largely and directly related to the spatio temporal variations in tws wahr et al 1998 grace mascon solutions were used to measure mass variations over large hydrologic systems e g wouters et al 2014 ahmed et al 2014 2016 mohamed et al 2016 sultan et al 2013 2014 abdelmohsen et al 2019 such as the mas monthly mascon solutions release 05 rl05 save et al 2016 from the center for space research at the university of texas http www csr utexas edu grace were used to estimate the temporal variations in tws over the investigated area for the period april 2002 to june 2016 all mascon solutions including the center for space research solutions applied in this study could be readily utilized in hydrologic applications without 1 any post processing and or filtering or 2 application of any empirical scaling factors save et al 2016 as is the case with other mascon solutions luthcke et al 2013 watkins et al 2015 the secular trend long term trend in grace derived tws data was extracted by simultaneously fitting a trend and a seasonal term to each tws time series errors associated with the calculated trend values were estimated tiwari et al 2009 scanlon et al 2016 1 monthly tws time series were fitted using annual semi annual and trend terms and residuals r1 were calculated 2 the calculated residuals r1 were smoothed using a 13 month moving average to remove the interannual signal a trend was removed and the residuals r2 were estimated 3 the standard deviation of r2 represented the maximum uncertainty amplitude of the measurement error in monthly tws values 4 monte carlo simulations were performed by fitting trends and seasonal terms for many n 10 000 synthetic monthly datasets each with values chosen from a population of gaussian distributed numbers having a standard deviation similar to that of the examined population and the standard deviation of the extracted synthetic trends was interpreted as the trend error for tws σtws the amplitude of the measurement error for each month standard deviation of r2 was calculated from steps 1 2 and 3 whereas the tws trend errors were estimated from step 4 monte carlo simulations grace cannot distinguish between anomalies resulting from different components of tws e g groundwater or soil moisture therefore outputs of lsms were used to remove the non groundwater components soil moisture from grace derived tws data the change in groundwater storage over the mas was extracted using the following equation 1 δ gws δ tws δ sms where δgws and δsms represent the change in groundwater and soil moisture storage respectively because there are no surface water bodies in the study area the change in surface water storage δsws is not included in eq 1 soil moisture was extracted from the gldas model because previous studies over saharan africa have shown that the global land data assimilation system gldas provides more reasonable estimates of soil moisture in arid areas when compared to estimates from other lsms ahmed et al 2016 the gldas model simulates soil moisture through its four models noah mosaic vic and clm each of which has its unique structure and parameters noah has four soil layers mosaic and vic models each has three layers and clm has ten layers rodell et al 2004 dai et al 2003 the soil moisture time series over the investigated areas were calculated by averaging the soil moisture estimates from the four gldas models rodell et al 2004 dai et al 2003 the gldas soil moisture values for each of the four models are weighted by the thickness of the individual layers errors in soil moisture trends σsms were calculated as the standard deviation of the trends computed from the four gldas simulations voss et al 2013 castle et al 2014 the trend errors in gws σgws were calculated by adding in quadrature uncertainties related to gracetws and sms trends eq 2 2 σ gws σ tws 2 σ sms 2 groundwater recharge rates were estimated over the investigated areas using eqs 3 and 4 3 δ gws rn ra qn qa where δgws represents the change in groundwater storage qn and qa represent the natural and anthropogenic discharge respectively and the

inorganic carbon dic was first extracted under vacuum by acidifying the water sample the extracted carbon dioxide was cryogenically purified from the other reaction products and catalytically converted to graphite using the method of vogel et al 1984 graphite 14c 13c ratios were measured using the 0 5 mev accelerator mass spectrometer at the university of georgia center for applied isotope

membrane rihs and condomines 2002 measurements were conducted using a high purity germanium well detector interfaced with an ortec dspec plus digital spectrometry system at the environmental isotope

of the 36cl cl atomic ratio 4 results and discussion 4 1 topography precipitation groundwater head data recharge location and groundwater flow direction major west east trending watersheds and drainage systems collect precipitation over the red sea hills and flow across the arabian peninsula the channeled precipitation can potentially recharge the paleozoic triassic cretaceous and tertiary aquifers where they crop out in the foothills of the red sea hills before any flow reaches the arabian gulf figs 2 and 4 this suggestion is supported by the static head data from 156 aramco wells fig 5 and by the precipitation patterns over the arabian peninsula fig 3 under the rak there is a clear southwest to northeast decrease in static head for wells penetrating the various aquifers fig 5 static water levels decrease from 700 m above mean sea level amsl in the foothills of the red sea hills to 200 m amsl in the central part of the rak and approach sea level near the arabian gulf fig 5 this static head gradient indicates that the recharge of the rakas is largely coming from precipitation over the red sea hills sultan et al 2008 this is also true for the northern parts of the mas brgm 2006 fig 3 shows the average annual precipitation aap over the arabian peninsula precipitation is concentrated over the mountain ranges and or highlands in the west red sea hills east oman mountains and south e g hadramount and dhofar mountains only the cenozoic aquifers crop out at the foothills of the southern and eastern highlands therefore precipitation over these mountains is less likely to recharge aquifers other than those of cenozoic age the highlands in the western parts of the mas generally receive higher amounts of precipitation compared to those in the eastern parts for example the westernmost parts of the rak at the foothills of the red sea hills receive relatively high annual precipitation 77 mm compared to the eastern parts 45 mm fig 3 the alluvial aquifers within the basement complex of the red sea hills and the unconfined sections of the paleozoic wajid aquifer that crops out at the foothills of these mountains figs 1 and 2 are replenished by modern precipitation channeled by ephemeral streams 4 2 aquifer recharge discharge depletion and optimum utilization the extent to which the fossil aquifers of the mas are being utilized in a sustainable manner and whether these aquifers are being supplemented by modern precipitation over the red sea hills was addressed by 1 analyzing the spatial and temporal variations in tws and gws 2 examining recharge estimates over areas of similar settings and 3 examining the variation in stable isotopic compositions of groundwater within and away from the potential recharge areas 4 2 1 trends in the grace data secular trends in grace derived tws were mapped over arabia fig 6 positive negative trends indicate increased decreased tws with time the three areas targeted for agricultural development over the past four to five decades were subjected to more specific grace analysis first order estimates for the area occupied by cultivated land was estimated from satellite imagery areas with high ndvi values and farmland texture the groundwater extraction was calculated from the product of the estimated cultivated land area and the average volume of water used to irrigate a unit area 1 4 m3 m2 yr brgm 2006 the cultivated land and groundwater extraction was estimated for 1 northern and central parts of arabia and of the mas fig 6 area a 0 58 106 km2 cultivated land 4 684 km2 groundwater extraction 6 6 km3 yr 2 eastern parts of the rakas fig 6 area b 0 89 106 km2 cultivated land 871 km2 groundwater extraction 1 2 km3 yr and 3 the western parts of the rakas fig 6 area c 0 22 106 km2 cultivated land 966 km2 groundwater extraction 1 4 km3 yr the estimated groundwater extraction for area a 6 6 km3 yr is similar to the reported extraction rates it was 7 to 8 km3 yr in year 2007 then continued to decline to reach 5 5 6 km3 yr by year 2015 othman et al 2018 the similarity in the estimated and observed extraction for area a gives confidence in the estimated extraction for areas b and c where no reported extraction rates are available for areas a b and c time series were calculated for 1 grace derived tws and 2 gws using gldas derived sms and applying eq 1 fig 7 figs 6 and 7 and table 2 show high depletions in tws over area a 7 2 1 0 mm yr 4 2 0 6 km3 yr and moderate to low depletions over area b 2 9 1 1 mm yr 2 5 1 0 km3 yr and area c 3 0 1 0 mm yr 0 7 0 2 km3 yr the steep negative tws trend observed in area a is attributed to groundwater extraction apparently not fully compensated by recharge this suggestion is supported by the wide distribution of the cultivated land in area a compared to areas b and c and by the high depletion rates in grace derived tws over area a fig 6 an additional factor that could have contributed to the observed tws depletion over area a is the decline in aap precipitation from 121 mm 1979 2001 to 75 mm during the grace period 2002 2016 gldas derived sms trends table 2 were estimated at 2 4 1 0 mm yr 1 4 0 6 km3 yr 1 0 0 8 mm yr 0 9 0 7 km3 yr and 2 3 0 9 mm yr 0 5 0 2 km3 yr for areas a b and c respectively similarly the gws time series fig 7 table 2 reveals high depletion rates for area a 4 8 1 4 mm yr 2 8 0 8 km3 yr low depletions for area b 1 8 1 4 mm yr 1 6 1 2 km3 yr but near steady conditions for area c 0 73 1 4 mm yr 0 2 0 3 km3 yr first order estimates of recharge and associated uncertainties over areas a 6 6 1 4 mm yr 3 8 0 8 km3 yr b 0 0 1 4 mm yr 0 0 1 2 km3 yr and c 5 6 1 4 mm yr 1 2 0 3 km3 yr were calculated using eqs 3 and 5 table 2 these recharge estimates should be considered as minimum values given that the natural discharge is unknown and is considered to be negligible area a lies to the northwest of and is distant 300 1500 km from the prominent oil and gas fields including the ghawar and surrounding fields fig 1 area outlined by blue polygon which produces the bulk of the saudi oil and gas fox and ahlbrandt 2002 an observation that suggests that oil and gas extraction is not the cause of the observed depletion over area a our findings indicate that area a is being over exploited when it comes to groundwater extraction this suggestion is supported by extraction data and by the observed decline in groundwater levels monitoring well data from area a showed a decline in groundwater levels of up to 50 m between years 2002 and 2015 othman et al 2018 until 1980 extraction in the study area was minimal 1 km3 yr and continued to increase until the 1990s and early 2000s after which it leveled off to around 7 to 8 km3 yr by 2007 followed by a decline to approximately 5 6 km3 yr by 2015 othman et al 2018 the difference between the reported extraction rates and the observed depletion rate is here interpreted to indicate partial replenishment of the extracted groundwater by modern precipitation sustainable extraction with the current crop and irrigation arrangements could be achieved if the annual extraction over the investigated period is reduced by the extracted depletion rate 2 8 km3 yr alternatively water intensive crops e g wheat and alfalfa in area a could be replaced by water saving crops e g potato sugar beet that require a fraction of the water used by the water intensive crops areas b and c show a low to near steady gws depletion rate of 1 8 1 4 mm yr to 0 73 1 4 mm yr respectively at the current levels of extraction only the southern parts of the mas i e areas b and c in rakas can be used for development of sustainable agriculture in saudi arabia 4 2 2 recharge estimates in similar hydrogeologic settings the temporal and spatial analyses of global trmm precipitation data 2002 2015 for the rak indicate that the aap over the rak is 51 mm yr and that from the cmap data 1979 2016 is 61 mm yr annual rainfall averaged over 1979 2009 measured at the wadi aldawasser najran and sharurah weather stations within the western part of the rak is 26 1 mm yr 60 1 mm yr and 70 3 mm yr respectively almazroui et al 2012 accurate estimation of the recharge from channel beds is a difficult task we present a first order recharge estimation from the channeled inland drainage system in the western sections of the rakas this estimation is based on comparisons to areas with similar hydrogeologic settings using 1983 1990 field based measurements and a water balance approach abdulrazzak and sorman 1994 and abdulrazzak 1995 estimated transmission losses in the tabalah basin in the southwestern region of saudi arabia at 15 25 of the precipitation volume using a chloride mass balance approach bazuhair and wood 1996 estimated recharge rates as 2 10 of total precipitation in the alluvial aquifers in several wadis along the red sea hills within the asir and hijaz mountains in western arabia similar estimates 10 20 of total precipitation were obtained for the tharad and yalamlam wadis in western saudi arabia subyani 2004 2005 using the same technique using a calibrated catchment based continuous 1998 2007 semi distributed hydrologic model soil water and assessment tool model swat milewski et al 2009 estimated recharge within the major watersheds in the sinai peninsula and the eastern desert of egypt at 15 7 and 21 2 of the aap respectively they attributed recharge solely to transmission losses given earlier findings of 1 minimal 4 of precipitation recharge through initial losses from studies in the arid southwestern united states e g flint et al 2000 the nevada basin dettinger 1989 and western saudi arabia bazuhair and wood 1996 and 2 negligible 4 of infiltration evaporation from channel reaches during flash floods e g abdulrazzak and sorman 1994 ben zvi and shentsis 2001 schwartz 2001 shentsis et al 1999 sorey and matlock 1969 guided by the above mentioned findings in similar geologic and hydrogeologic settings and adopting a recharge rate of 10 of the precipitated volume 16 km3 yr over area c we estimate a recharge of 1 6 km3 yr the estimated recharge is comparable yet exceeds the grace derived recharge rate 1 2 0 3 km3 yr that was calculated using eq 3 as predicted and described earlier the grace derived recharge underestimates recharge given that the natural discharge component is unknown and is here neglected similarly the precipitation derived recharge rate for area a 5 3 km3 yr exceeds the grace derived rates 3 8 0 8 km3 yr the larger discrepancy between the precipitation derived 3 9 km3 yr and the grace derived 0 0 1 2 km3 yr rates for area b is here attributed to extensive discharge which was not accounted for in the grace derived recharge calculations this discharge occurs over extensive areas proximal to the arabian gulf now covered by active sabkhas and salt pans and in the gulf as well sultan et al 2008 kalbus et al 2011 schulz et al 2015 4 3 geochemical data origin history and suitability of rakas in this section we provide geochemical data to address the origin and evolution of groundwater in the rak water quality of the aquifer and its suitability for direct use in either irrigation or as drinking water chlorine 36 calculated model ages are given in table 3 and isotopic analyses including stable isotope ratios of hydrogen and oxygen in water 14c uncalibrated 14c model ages and radium isotope activities are given in table 4 concentrations of cations and anions along with ph and alkalinity are given in table 5 the results are discussed in the following sections with reference to our previous study of groundwater from the eastern portion of the rak sultan et al 2008 we demonstrate that the groundwater hosted in the rakas is largely fossil yet its western sections are receiving modern contributions we also show that the western rak groundwater unlike the eastern rak is characterized by low salinities table 5 acceptable for direct use in irrigation and drinking 4 3 1 14c activities and 36cl abundances in water samples and groundwater residence time 36cl has been used successfully to date very old nubian aquifer groundwater in the western desert of egypt sturchio et al 2004 patterson et al 2005 and may provide useful constraints on groundwater residence times in the rakas an important difference between the rakas and the nubian aquifer however is that the chloride concentration is about 10 times higher in the western rakas groundwater table 5 than in the nubian aquifer groundwater patterson et al 2005 the chloride concentrations in these samples are mostly in the range of 160 570 mg l table 5 which is similar to the range in chloride concentrations of shallow groundwater in water aquifers near jeddah bazuhair and wood 1996 such high chloride concentrations in shallow groundwater most likely reflect evaporation prior to recharge as implied by the chloride mass balance model bazuhair and wood 1996 this may complicate the interpretation of the groundwater ages in the western rak because of in situ nucleogenic production of 36cl within the aquifer which becomes an important consideration where the chloride concentration in groundwater exceeds 100 mg l phillips 2000 the conversion of 36cl cl ratios to a groundwater model age in the absence of subsurface 36cl production or chloride addition is based simply on the radioactive decay of the initial 36cl according to 7 t 1 λ ln r m r i where r m and r i are the measured and initial 36cl cl ratios respectively λ 2 303 10 6 yr is the decay constant of 36cl and t is the mean 36cl model age of the water in years this corresponds to a piston flow model of the aquifer a more realistic age estimate may be obtained when the subsurface secular equilibrium ratio r se is taken into account but no additional subsurface cl is added and in this case the following equation may be used after bentley et al 1986 8 t 1 λ ln r m r se r i r se an r se value of 5 10 15 is assumed as a reasonable estimate for a sandstone aquifer based on the results of patterson et al 2005 the initial value of the 36cl cl ratio is a critical issue in 36cl dating of groundwater because this value varies with geographic location davis et al 1998 phillips 2000 the best fit initial value of 36cl cl for the nubian aquifer is 130 10 15 patterson et al 2005 in the present study our approach is to use the samples with the youngest 14c model ages to constrain the initial 36cl cl ratio because wells eq2 57 and eq2 60 are the shallowest wells sampled total depth of 80 and 60 m respectively in the presumed recharge area of the western rakas samples collected from these wells are assumed to be the youngest the 14c model ages for samples eq2 57 and eq2 60 were found to be 6700 and 8500 years b p and their 36cl cl ratios were in agreement at 61 5 10 15 and 65 5 10 15 respectively the initial 36cl cl ratio in the rak is apparently lower than that in the western desert of egypt this is consistent with the location of the red sea hills and the prevailing storm tracks from the northwest that may import marine aerosols from both the mediterranean and red sea the difference in the 36cl cl ratios of samples eq2 57 and eq2 60 is within the error of the 36cl cl measurement a decrease in this ratio from 65 to 61 can be produced by decay of 36cl in about 30 000 yr virtually the entire range of 14c model ages is within the measurement error of the initial 36cl cl ratio one of the water samples in this study sample eq2 58 yielded a higher measured 36cl cl ratio of 87 7 10 15 this may indicate a range of initial 36cl cl ratios which complicates the interpretation of 36cl data in terms of groundwater residence times however there is a cluster of 36cl cl ratios from 54 10 15 to 65 10 15 in waters from the presumed recharge area at the eastern base of the red sea hills therefore an initial 36cl cl ratio of 65 10 15 is a more conservative assumption and will yield minimum 36cl model ages the 36cl cl ratios of the water samples are compared with their 36cl concentrations in fig 8 there is a general correlation of 36cl cl and 36cl concentration which is consistent with variation in 36cl being caused simply by radioactive decay rather than subsurface production or chloride input fig 8 this supports the validity of 36cl for groundwater dating in this aquifer system table 3 lists 36cl model ages that were calculated from eqs 7 and 8 assuming a value of 65 10 15 for the initial 36cl cl ratio r i and a value of 5 10 15 for the secular equilibrium ratio of 36cl cl r se the resulting ranges in 36cl model ages are from 50 kyr to approximately 1 million yr with a general trend of increasing age with distance from the presumed recharge area in the red sea highlands of western saudi arabia an additional observation is that the 36cl model ages calculated by eq 7 are slightly younger than those calculated by eq 8 in the cases where two samples were collected from the same aquifer at different distances from the recharge area an increase in 36cl model age consistent with an increase in groundwater residence time along the flow path from west to east was observed fig 11 for example wells eq2 60 and eq2 7 tap the upper paleozoic aquifer and their 36cl model ages are 0 50 and 970 kyr respectively the former is drilled within the recharge area and the latter some 200 km away from it eq2 58 and eq2 59 were sampled from wells within the recharge areas of the lower paleozoic aquifer they have similar 36cl model ages of 50 kyr and 30 40 kyr respectively eq2 61 and eq2 5 were sampled from the recharge areas of the jurassic aquifer they too have 36cl model ages eq2 61 90 60 kyr eq2 5 170 70 kyr that are within the measurement uncertainties wells eq2 20 eq2 21 and eq2 23 are located near each other in the eastern portion of the study area in a low relief sand covered area and are tapping water from the eocene aquifer these samples have ages ranging from 420 to 600 kyr and their recharge area is most likely farther to the east than that of the older aquifers fig 2 these eocene aquifer water samples also have the highest δ18o values table 4 of the sampled wells with the exception of the open pit wells the geographic distribution obtained from the 36cl model ages fig 11 is consistent with rakas recharge being largely during pleistocene wet climatic periods and with groundwater flow rates on the order of approximately one meter per year these groundwater ages and flow rates could be verified in the future by 81kr measurements in a groundwater traverse across the region 4 3 2 hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in water samples and groundwater origin and sources the water samples have a wide range in stable isotopic composition with δd values ranging from 76 6 to 13 2 and δ18o values ranging from 10 1 to 0 9 table 4 these data from the western rak are shown in comparison with those from the eastern rak sultan et al 2008 data for modern precipitation in bahrain iaea wmo and data for groundwater from the gulf of suez area sturchio et al 1996 in fig 9 the overall pattern of isotopic compositions for western rak samples resembles that found by sultan et al 2008 for eastern rak samples in the earlier study and in this study the samples from deep wells have isotopic compositions near the meteoric water line and are more depleted in heavy isotopes than modern precipitation over bahrain while resembling those of fossil groundwater from the gulf of suez region samples from shallow open pit wells have isotopic compositions indicative of substantial evaporation if recharge of the rakas is largely from precipitation over the red sea hills one would expect maximum contributions from modern precipitation within recharge areas cropping out at the foothills of the basement complex and decreased contributions with increasing distance from the mountains and or depth of wells this is because our conceptual model calls on recharge from precipitation over the red sea hills that is channeled downslope as runoff and as subsurface flow towards the recharge areas inspection of table 4 and fig 11 shows that indeed this is the case for example a lower paleozoic wajid aquifer sample eq2 58 from a well total depth td 200 m proximal 15 km to the basement complex is enriched δd 32 7 and δ18o 5 1 compared to a sample eq 59 from a deeper 300 m well 24 km away from the basement complex δd 46 8 and δ18o 6 91 this is also true for samples collected from the upper paleozoic wajid eq2 60 and eq2 7 and jurassic eq2 61 and eq2 5 aquifers sample eq2 60 is enriched δd 46 1 and δ18o 5 9 compared to sample eq2 7 δd 76 7 and δ18o 10 1 eq2 60 was collected from a shallow well td 60 m 41 km from the basement whereas eq2 7 was sampled from a deep td 1137 m well 267 km away from the basement similarly eq2 5 is enriched δd 42 9 and δ18o 6 1 compared to eq2 61 δd 64 1 and δ18o 8 5 the former was collected from a 280 m deep well 77 km from the basement whereas the latter came from a deeper well td 450 m well located 105 km from the basement the majority of the samples from the western and eastern rak seem to have a consistent isotopic composition an observation that is also supportive of the proposed recharge sultan et al 2008 of the rakas from precipitation over the red sea hills however a few of the western rak samples have isotopically lighter compositions than any of the eastern rak samples this may indicate recharge of these samples at higher elevations red sea hills during colder climates as compared with the eastern samples which are all sampled from the eocene aquifer 4 3 3 solute concentrations and natural radioactivity in water samples the chemical compositions of the water samples are reported in table 5 the samples all have near neutral ph 7 1 8 3 and relatively low salinities in the range of about 800 to 8000 mg l total dissolved solids tds the two most saline samples are from open pit wells eq2 18 and eq2 22 and these have most likely experienced substantial evaporation as indicated by the stable isotope data discussed below the deep well water samples have tds concentrations in the range of about 800 2800 mg l which is considered reasonably fresh and can be used for irrigation without treatment and possibly for drinking water with minor treatment in contrast most of the water samples analyzed by sultan et al 2008 from the eastern rak have much higher salinity up to 90 000 mg l and would not be acceptable for direct use in either irrigation or for drinking water a comparison of the δ2h values and chloride concentrations mg l for water samples from this study and the eastern rak sultan et al 2008 is shown in fig 10 a also shown in fig 10a are arrows representing two processes affecting the chemical composition alone salt dissolution or both the chemical and isotopic compositions evaporation of the waters hypothetical evaporation of meteoric water beginning at δ2h 50 and chloride concentration 10 mg l does not explain any of the water compositions indicating that solutes are being enriched by dissolution of salts or aquifer rocks for the most saline waters found in the eastern rak it appears that some dissolution of subsurface evaporite formations and or surficial sabkha salts including halite has occurred sultan et al 2008 the western rak samples have relatively low salinity and do not appear to have been affected by evaporite dissolution in the subsurface the most abundant solutes in the waters on a molar basis are sodium na and chloride cl table 5 a diagram of na vs cl concentrations shows that the na cl ratio is fairly constant for all waters over a wide range of salinity fig 10b this is consistent with acquisition of these solutes either by concentration of salts from marine aerosols upon which raindrops may nucleate or from dissolution of halite which may occur as trace salts in arid soils or as evaporite deposits in the subsurface evaporite deposits are known to occur in the lower eocene jurassic and proterozoic hormuz salts formations of saudi arabia dissolution of aquifer rocks also affects groundwater compositions in the rak as discussed by sultan et al 2008 this is demonstrated by a diagram of calcium ca versus sulfate so4 concentrations fig 10c which shows that the ratio ca so4 varies between that in marine aerosols indicated by seawater mixing line and that in gypsum caso4 h2o or anhydrite caso4 both of which occur in several of the formations in the jurassic through eocene stratigraphic sequence of saudi arabia and are likely to be encountered and dissolved along groundwater flow paths the only water samples not showing evidence of caso4 dissolution are those from the eocene aquifer in the eastern part of the study area e g eq2 20 eq2 21 and eq2 23 samples collected from eastern rak could have acquired much of their solutes in the subsurface from interaction with aquifer rocks along their flow paths by ion exchange reactions e g appelo 1994 chapelle and knobel 1983 and by dissolution of evaporites a likely candidate for the solute source is the hormoz series an upper proterozoic sedimentary sequence 2 km thick that underlies all major oil fields in the persian gulf area and surroundings fig 11 it is largely composed of bedded salt gypsum and anhydrite with thick interbedded dolomite shale and sandstone another candidate could be the evaporite beds within the lower eocene rus formation which underlies the productive aquifer of the middle eocene dammam formation a suggestion that is supported by the similarity of the strontium isotopic composition of groundwater to that of the eocene seawater sultan et al 2008 alternatively the deeper groundwater could have ascended through structural discontinuities dissolved evaporative salts and undergone substantial near surface evaporation in groundwater discharge zones sabkhas that are prominent in the eastern sections of rak but absent in the western parts this suggestion is supported by the correspondence between the distribution of the highest salinities in the groundwater data with that of the sabkha outcrops and the hormoz formation at depth fig 11 to conclude the western rak groundwater but not that of the eastern rak has relatively low salinities acceptable for direct use in either irrigation or as drinking water the most abundant radioactive isotopes in many groundwater systems are the radium isotopes 226ra and 228ra these isotopes represent a health hazard if ingested measurements of these isotopes were completed for 10 samples collected from the western rak and most were below the detection limit for 226ra and were also low in 228ra activity only three samples eq2 20 eq2 21 and eq 23 all from the eocene aquifer had ra activities higher than the us epa regulatory limit for drinking water which is 0 185 bq kg combined activity of 226ra 228ra sample 23 has ra activity more than three times the us epa limit these high ra samples are all from the eocene aquifer in the eastern part of the study area suggesting that groundwater from this aquifer may require ra removal before being used for drinking or irrigation based on our preliminary findings the ra isotope activities in the western rak do not seem to pose serious hazard risks with the exception of water taken from the eocene aquifer this supports the earlier suggestion that groundwater from the western rak but not the eastern rak is acceptable for direct use as drinking water or in irrigation 5 findings and implications a two step approach was conducted to assess the sustainability origin age evolution and groundwater potential of large fossil aquifers using the mas as a test site 1 the sustainability of the mas was investigated through the analysis of grace data and lsm outputs and 2 integrated geochemical remote sensing and field studies were conducted to address the age origin hydrogeological setting and evolution of the rakas the area identified from the analysis of grace and lsms as being the most suited for sustainable development data from grace and outputs of the gldas model were used to estimate the depletion rates for the mas and to investigate the sustainability of the aquifer considering the average groundwater extraction rates and the aquifer capture potential to balance groundwater extraction throughout the investigated period our findings indicate that the central and northern parts of the mas area a are experiencing high gws depletion rates 4 8 1 4 mm yr that cannot be balanced by aquifer capture induced by excessive extraction area a is currently being overexploited yet sustainable extraction could be achieved if the average extraction over the investigated period is reduced by up to 2 8 km3 yr the southern parts of the mas are experiencing low gws depletion rates 1 8 1 4 mm yr in area b to steady state 0 7 1 4 in area c at the current levels of extraction the rakas areas b and c could be used in a sustainable manner we demonstrated for the rakas that information pertaining to the sustainability and longevity of aquifers that was extracted from grace and lsms should be complemented by observations from traditional data sources for a better understanding of the origin evolution and hydrogeological setting of the investigated aquifer and the quality of its waters although we believe that the rak aquifers are largely formed of fossil water as much as 750 1000 kyr old as indicated by their 36cl model ages we suggest that during the intervening dry periods as is the case now these aquifers must receive additional recharge given 1 the relatively high precipitation over the red sea hills 2 the presence of a network of ephemeral streams that can channel these waters to the recharge areas at the foothills of these mountains and 3 the isotopic composition of groundwater that shows evidence of increased mixing with modern precipitation at shallow depths within recharge areas proximal to the basement complex not only is the western rak receiving substantial modern recharge but its water quality may be adequate for a variety of agricultural and domestic uses the western rak samples have relatively low salinity that is acceptable for direct use in either irrigation or as drinking water and the ra isotope activities do not appear to pose serious hazard risks the example provided here represents a straightforward demonstration for the potential use of grace data for the development of sustainable extraction scenarios for aquifers in arid environments world wide if the focus was on the quantity of water alone the proposed method assumes that aquifers approach near steady conditions with time yet aquifer depletions can occur in gws as a result of excessive extraction and or diminished recharge conditions related to climate change we propose that regardless of the cause s of aquifer depletion sustainable extraction could be attained by reducing the current extraction rates by the estimated depletion rates in gws over areas of interest and that the proposed reductions will cancel out the estimated gws depletions the advocated method is especially useful for the less investigated aquifers that lack the data required by the methods currently being used in the evaluation of aquifer sustainability such as recharge discharge and extraction rates and temporal precipitation and water level datasets examples of methods used in the evaluation of aquifer sustainability include groundwater flow models and the groundwater footprint gf method the construction and calibration of many of the groundwater flow models requires extensive monitoring networks and archival records of precipitation and head data the groundwater footprint method gleeson et al 2016 requires knowledge of annual abstraction and recharge rates and the groundwater contribution to environmental streamflow such datasets are often missing for many of the world s fossil aquifer systems the gf method defines the area required to sustain groundwater use and groundwater dependent ecosystem services of a region of interest the proposed grace based methodology has its own limitations as well the method assumes that for area a groundwater extraction cannot be balanced by capture new equilibrium will not be attained and aquifer depletion would continue while this is probably true for area a within the mas and for large sectors of similar fossil aquifers worldwide they are not accurate for aquifers receiving considerable modern recharge for such aquifers the estimated reductions in extraction to achieve sustainable utilization of the aquifer will be overestimated and should be considered as an upper limit the change in the grace derived groundwater storage over the grace period was used as the basis for judging the sustainability of the arabian aquifer systems in doing so one hopes that the mass variations that are related to semi annual annual multi annual and decadal climatic cycles are represented in the examined grace record while the semi annual annual and multi annual cycles are likely to be represented in the available grace records and in the solutions that we derived the decadal cycles might not be given the short grace operational period 14 5 years the acquisition of twsgrace data over the upcoming years by the grace fo may 2018 with a nominal expected lifetime of 5 10 years and grace ii planned in 2025 with a nominal expected lifetime of 5 10 years missions will in part address these limitations by enabling the acquisition of continuous and lengthy twsgrace records the spatial resolution of grace data is coarse 1 1 and the proposed methodologies cannot be applied to small 120 120 km areas save et al 2016 as described earlier the current extraction rate for area a should be reduced by 2 8 km3 yr to reach sustainable extraction but no reductions are required for areas b and c the proposed reductions in extraction amounts should take into account the uncertainties associated with the estimation of the depletion rates if they were considered for area a reductions in extraction would range from 2 0 3 4 km3 yr in addition there is a need to refine those estimates as the grace temporal record increases with time the advocated grace sustainability approach focuses on the quantity but not the quality of groundwater and does not advance our understanding of the geologic and hydrologic setting of the aquifer and the age origin and history of its groundwater for these reasons additional integrated field isotopic geochemical and geochronological studies similar to those presented for the rak should be conducted in areas that show promising grace sustainability results investigating the sustainability of aquifers under current natural and anthropogenic discharge rates determining the quantity of modern recharge the quality of water and the age and evolution of aquifers are all significant and complementary steps towards the development of sound sustainable water management programs for aquifers in general and fossil aquifers such as the mas in particular the proposed techniques should not be considered as alternatives to the development of comprehensive calibrated groundwater flow models but possibly as complementary measurements

6297,the magnitude and frequency of hydro meteorological extremes are expected to increase in a changing environment in ways that threaten the security of us energy water assets these include probable maximum precipitation pmp and probable maximum flood pmf which are used as hydraulic design standards for highly sensitive infrastructures such as nuclear power plants and main dams to assess the flood vulnerability due to pmp pmf an integrated high resolution process based hydro meteorologic modeling framework was used to develop ensemble based probabilistic flood maps based on best available historic observations and future climate projections a graphics processing unit accelerated 2 dimensional hydrodynamic model was used to simulate the surface inundation areas corresponding to a total of 120 pmf hydrographs these ensemble based pmf maps were compared with flood maps obtained from the conventional deterministic pmp pmf approach revealing added information about conditional probability of flooding further a relative sensitivity test was conducted to explore the effects of various factors in the framework such as meteorological forcings antecedent hydrologic conditions reservoir storage and flood model input resolution and parameters the proposed framework better illustrates the uncertainties associated with model inputs parameterization and hydro meteorological factors allowing more informed decision making for future emergency preparation keywords flood modeling graphics processing units gpu probable maximum precipitation pmp probable maximum flood pmf probabilistic flood maps pfms 1 introduction floods are one of the most destructive natural hazards causing mortality property loss and infrastructure damage worldwide the united states us alone has observed 29 billion dollar scale flood events in the period of 1980 2018 with a total of 543 deaths and roughly 122 billion dollars in inflation adjusted losses ncei 2018 the increasing frequency and magnitude of flood events under changing climate population and land use and land cover conditions require better predictability and preparedness for flood hazards flood inundation maps serve as a critical input to flood risk assessments and enable the development of informed floodplain management and mitigation strategies in the us the federal emergency management agency fema utilizes hydrologic and hydraulic models to delineate flood inundation zones associated with 1 and 0 2 annual exceedance probability aep or 100 year and 500 year return periods to support the national flood insurance program fema 2018 for critical energy water infrastructures including major hydropower dams and nuclear power plants even rarer events aep 0 2 or probable maximum flood pmf are the focus similar inundation maps developed for pmf scale events may serve as useful tools to evaluate the vulnerability of critical infrastructures under worst case flooding scenarios as well as to identify regions with minimum flooding likelihood to support future site selection a general procedure to prepare flood inundation maps hereinafter referred as a modeling chain associated with pmf involves probable maximum precipitation pmp estimation followed by hydrologic simulation and hydrodynamic hydraulic modeling since the current practice of pmp pmf assessment focuses on estimating the single deterministic maximum precipitation and streamflow event that could occur under a series of adverse hydro meteorological conditions conventional pmf inundation maps are also deterministic in nature however deterministic maps inevitably mask out underlying uncertainties from decision makers or planners given the binary wet or dry representation of the resulting flood inundation maps while advanced deterministic maps employ process based hydrologic and hydraulic models calibrated to historic events di baldassarre et al 2010 these maps are unable to capture the uncertainties arising from various other sources in the modeling chain such as inaccurate input data boundary conditions model structure and model parameterization alfonso et al 2016 di baldassarre et al 2010 therefore the value and potential of probabilistic flood maps pfms have been highlighted recently in the literature alfonso et al 2016 di baldassarre et al 2010 papaioannou et al 2017 recent advances in computational power have allowed the use of computationally intensive hydrologic hydraulic models to develop pfms through multi ensemble simulation neal et al 2013 the uncertainty characterization may be performed at various stages of the modeling chain by varying factors such as precipitation caseri et al 2016 spatiotemporal rainfall variability jenkins et al 2017 nuswantoro et al 2016 zischg et al 2018 spatial dependence of flow from tributaries neal et al 2013 pattison et al 2014 hydrologic model parameters or inputs domeneghetti et al 2013 hydraulic model types papaioannou et al 2016 hydraulic model roughness coefficient papaioannou et al 2017 and different digital elevation models and observational data sets giustarini et al 2016 papaioannou et al 2016 although a few studies have focused on the development of flood inundation maps for the largest historic events e g pedrozo acuña et al 2015 or for events with return periods ranging from hundreds smemoe et al 2007 kalyanapu et al 2012 to thousands of years büchele et al 2006 prime et al 2016 studies evaluating flood inundation maps for rare hydroclimatic extreme events such as pmp pmf are limited zischg et al 2018 further recent studies have suggested that pmp pmf are sensitive to the changing climatic conditions e g kunkel et al 2013 beauchamp et al 2013 rousseau et al 2014 stratz and hossain 2014 klein et al 2016 rastogi et al 2017 gangrade et al 2018 and challenged the deterministic treatment of pmp pmf it has also been suggested that both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties are involved in the estimation of pmp micovic et al 2015 for instance pmp and pmf estimates are often derived for a point location of interest without considering variability originating from spatiotemporal rainfall distribution or watershed heterogeneity through monte carlo simulation zischg et al 2018 demonstrated that the spatiotemporal distribution of pmp has significant effects on the resulting pmf inundation maps other factors such as meteorological forcings antecedent soil moisture land use land cover conditions and reservoir operation gangrade et al 2018 may introduce further uncertainties to the pmf estimate and consequently the resulting surface inundation area the 2017 hurricane harvey precipitation near houston texas is reported to exceed the hydrometeorological report no 51 hmr51 schreiner and riedel 1978 72 h pmp estimates at 5000 mi2 and 10 000 mi2 scales kao et al 2019 suggesting that an extremely large pmp scale storm is physically possible considering that there has not been a focused federal effort since the publication of hmrs it is of critical importance to advance our concept and practice from the conventional deterministic treatment of pmp pmf to an ensemble based probabilistic flood mapping approach to better analyze and quantify the vulnerability of critical energy water infrastructures in a changing environment in this study building upon our prior work involving pmp pmf simulations rastogi et al 2017 gangrade et al 2018 we present a high resolution process based hydro meteorological modeling framework to produce probabilistic flood inundation maps for pmf the main objectives of the study are 1 to employ an ensemble based approach to translate uncertainties associated with pmp to flood inundation maps 2 to prepare probabilistic flood inundation maps illustrating uncertainties with the flood hazard modeling chain of pmf and 3 to quantify the potential impacts of environmental change on the inundation areas of pmf the study area includes areas immediately upstream and downstream of the allatoona dam in georgia us for pmp we used weather research forecasting wrf a numerical weather simulation model skamarock et al 2008 to create an ensemble of 120 storms the input forcings to the wrf model is provided by reanalysis as well as climate projections as detailed in rastogi et al 2017 these 120 pmp storms were then used to conduct pmf estimates using the distributed hydrologic soil vegetation model dhsvm wigmosta et al 1994 as described by gangrade et al 2018 the ensemble of pmf hydrographs was further used to drive a high resolution graphics processing unit gpu accelerated 2 dimensional 2d dynamic wave flood model flood2d gpu kalyanapu et al 2011 to simulate the spatiotemporal evolution of pmf and to develop ensemble based pfms apart from better quantifying uncertainties compared with the deterministic approach the ensemble based flood mapping approach allowed us to better visualize the potential impacts of pmf through a spatially explicit more intuitive manner this study is the first of its kind that implements a high resolution modeling framework to assess changes in flood regime through an ensemble based approach for pmf to account for a changing climate and other factors the study also includes a relative sensitivity experiment to evaluate the sensitivity of various factors in the modeling chain including inputs such as precipitation hydrologic model antecedent conditions and hydraulic model parameters although the proposed study is presented for a selected watershed the methodology can also be adopted for other locations with similar climates and geographical settings for broader applications this study is organized as follows section 2 provides an overview of the study area methodology and data section 3 presents results and associated discussion and section 4 summarizes and concludes the study 2 methods 2 1 study area this study focuses on the etowah watershed located in the northwestern georgia us we selected this watershed because it includes a major reservoir and urban areas and lies in a relatively flat topographic region allowing transposition of pmp storms the etowah watershed has an estimated drainage area of 4821 km2 1861 mi2 fig 1 and is a part of the alabama coosa tallapoosa act river basin it drains parts of 15 counties in georgia and covers major urban areas including the city of cartersville and parts of atlanta s metropolitan area such as woodstock marietta and alpharetta the etowah watershed includes a large multi purpose reservoir allatoona lake and dam owned and operated by the us army corps of engineers usace with a maximum storage capacity of roughly 826 5 million m3 the second largest dam in the act river basin while the headwaters of etowah watershed include mountainous areas such as the piedmont mountains the topography of the rest of the watershed is moderate with elevations ranging from 176 m 577 ft to 1147 m 3763 ft as per the national elevation dataset ned gesch et al 2002 the region receives roughly 1336 mm of annual precipitation predominantly in the form of rainfall with light snowfall in the headwater region the major soil types include silty loam and sandy loam according to the national land cover database 2006 fry et al 2011 61 of the basin is covered by forests 18 5 lies under small vegetation and 18 5 falls in the developed category the main critical infrastructure located in the etowah watershed is the allatoona dam which produces hydroelectric power for the region the pmfs developed through the wrf and dhsvm cover both the upstream and downstream areas of the allatoona lake and dam to further demonstrate the applicability of probabilistic flood maps for other energy infrastructures we also evaluate 16 selected electrical substations obtained from homeland infrastructure foundation level data fig 1 in the watershed four different types of modeling analysis domains were used in this study the wrf meteorological and dhsvm hydrologic modeling domains covered the etowah watershed as well as the entire act river basin see rastogi et al 2017 and gangrade et al 2018 for domain details two flood2d gpu modeling domains i e 358 km2 me01 flood2d gpu and 507 km2 me02 flood2d gpu in fig 1 were set up within the etowah watershed and final analysis was performed for two slightly smaller analysis domains me01 and me02 the two regions upstream me01 and immediately downstream me02 from allatoona dam were selected such that they cover parts of the atlanta metropolitan region and the city of cartersville in the etowah watershed the computational domains of flood2d gpu were set to be larger than the analysis domains to avoid potential backwater effects and computational domain boundary artifacts 2 2 simulation setup we used a process based high resolution modeling framework to develop multi ensemble flood inundation maps associated with pmf estimates the main steps involved 1 simulation of pmp storms 2 simulation of pmf hydrographs and 3 simulation of flood regimes a brief overview of the methods follows 2 2 1 simulation of pmp the simulation of pmp storms was performed using a mesoscale numerical weather model wrf version 3 6 the wrf model is driven using boundary forcings from a a reanalysis dataset climate forecast system reanalysis i cfsr saha et al 2010 and b a global climate model community climate system model version 4 ccsm4 gent et al 2011 the wrf model setup at a 9 km and 3 km double nested horizonal grid resolutions was driven for 120 selected storms table 1 using the relative humidity maximization rhm method to simulate pmp before pmp estimation wrf parameterization was selected by testing the simulated 3 day rainfall depth against the prism daly et al 2008 and daymet thornton et al 1997 precipitation datasets to assess and compare wrf performance pmp was then estimated using the selected parameterization with the rhm method which maximizes the relative humidity of the entire atmospheric column to 100 at initial and boundary conditions following ohara et al 2011 and ishida et al 2015 the pmp outputs were stored at 1 hourly temporal resolution the readers are referred to rastogi et al 2017 for further technical details regarding pmp estimation and wrf performance evaluation in addition hydrometeorological report hmr 51 schreiner and riedel 1978 and hmr52 usace 1984 were used to obtain conventional pmp rainfall estimates for the study area this enables a comparison of ensemble based simulations with the conventional deterministic approach and serves as a reference the ensemble approach relies on identifying the most critical pmf event based on hydrologic and hydraulic simulations for each of the pmp storms as opposed to one deterministic event under conventional approach estimated using synthetic hyetographs the ensemble based approach leads to better understanding of the uncertainty associated with pmp estimates 2 2 2 simulation of pmf the pmf simulations were conducted by using each of the 120 moisture maximized storms as the meteorological forcing input to drive a high resolution dhsvm dhsvm was selected because of its wide applications in hydroclimate impact assessments and its capability to generate high resolution streamflow data required to drive the consequent hydrodynamic flood models dhsvm is a distributed process based model and performs water energy balance calculations to account for various hydrological processes the model uses precipitation air temperature radiation both longwave and shortwave wind speed and relative humidity as input datasets wigmosta et al 1994 and 2002 storck et al 1998 the dhsvm setup for the etowah watershed was obtained from gangrade et al 2018 which is a part of a larger modeling effort performed for the act river basin the dhsvm simulation was performed at the 3 hourly time step and 90 m horizontal grid resolution from 1980 2012 the 90 m ned is used as the base digital elevation model dem map for dhsvm simulation further the soil miller and white 1998 and land use and land cover data nlcd fry et al 2011 were resampled at the base map resolution to serve as inputs to hydrologic simulation the stream network was obtained from the national hydrography dataset plus mckay et al 2012 readers are referred to gangrade et al 2018 for associated detailed technical descriptions regarding setup calibration and validation to simulate pmf specifically for the etowah watershed for every storm listed in table 1 section 2 2 1 the largest 72 h average precipitation which is the largest duration commonly used by hmr reports to estimate pmp over the watershed was identified from the wrf output and transpositioned to the center of the etowah watershed as an input for dhsvm given the relatively smooth topography in the act river basin compared with other mountainous regions in the us storms within the basin can be considered meteorologically transpositionable this enables identification of the most critical pmp input for the study area and ensures that the pmp storm is captured by the watershed the simulated precipitation depth from the most inner wrf domain as explained in section 2 2 1 was further re gridded aggregated as 3 hourly inputs to dhsvm at a 4 km horizontal grid resolution radar rainfall format following the nuclear regulatory commission guidelines a critical meteorological sequence was used for pmf estimation prasad et al 2011 the meteorological sequence included 40 of 72 hr pmp antecedent precipitation followed by no precipitation for 72 hours and then a full 100 72 hr pmp critical precipitation fully saturated moisture conditions were used at the beginning of the dhsvm simulations this approach provides an ensemble of simulated dhsvm streamflow hydrographs for each set of storms sets as specified in table 1 i e cfsr ct ccsm4 bl ccsm4 f1 and ccsm4 f2 the ensemble pmf hydrographs obtained above were also compared against conventional pmf driven by conventional pmp rainfall estimates calculated for etowah watershed using hmr51 and hmr52 the detailed methodology is described in gangrade et al 2018 2 2 3 simulation of flood regime the hydrodynamic flood simulation was performed using the computationally enhanced version of the 2d hydraulic model flood2d gpu marshall et al 2018 originally developed by kalyanapu et al 2011 flood2d gpu uses a first order accurate upwind finite difference scheme in solving the nonlinear hyperbolic shallow water saint venant equations which are a simplified version of the navier stokes equations with horizontal momentum and continuity equations integrated over water depth the model implements on a structured grid to take advantage of the uniform grid structure of the dem data the computational performance of the flood2d gpu model was improved using a hybrid message passing interface mpi and compute unified device architecture cuda the model speed up for the mpi multiple gpu version was up to 18 compared with an identical single process open multi processing openmp version marshall et al 2018 benefitting from gpu acceleration the high performance of flood2d gpu allowed us to perform ensemble simulation for two domains me01 400 000 grid cells 360 km2 and me02 563 000 grid cells 507 km2 the simulations were conducted on the titan supercomputer maintained by the oak ridge leadership computing facility and used 1 million computing hours for ensemble flood simulation the key input data required for flood2d gpu include dem surface roughness manning s n value inflow source locations and the corresponding streamflow hydrographs in this study both 30 m and 10 m resolution dem data were obtained from ned we tested several commonly used manning s n values and selected 0 035 as the default value discussed in section 3 for the selection of inflow locations fig 1 we first identified the main upstream nhdplus channel segments that flow into the flood2d gpu simulation domain we then selected a series of additional nhdplus segments with approximately 50 km2 incremental drainage areas to input the incremental streamflow hydrographs the corresponding hydrographs for each of the 120 storms were extracted using high resolution hydrologic outputs from dhsvm at 3 h time steps for both domains i e me01 and me02 the flood2d gpu was driven by 5 day hydrographs that capture the peak discharge of each storm event and the output was stored at a 10 minute temporal resolution for each storm the flood2d gpu performance is evaluated and presented in the results and discussion section the current model setup captures riverine or fluvial floods the pluvial flood simulation an important aspect for flood map generation to support decision making shall be incorporated in the future model improvements apart from the default simulations driven by simulated pmf hydrographs an additional set of 120 flood simulations were conducted for me02 downstream of allatoona dam with modified upstream inflow to understand the maximum flood retention capacity under idealized reservoir operation denoted as me02r at the stream segment immediately downstream of the allatoona lake and dam the volume equal to the maximum storage capacity of the allatoona reservoir i e 826 5 million m3 was subtracted from the peak of the pmf hydrograph in other words this me02r simulation assumes that the reservoir can be fully emptied right before a pmf event remains structurally intact throughout the entire event and is operated optimally to reduce the peak discharge of a pmf event the modified hydrograph in addition to natural flow from other tributaries served as an input for me02 to drive flood2d gpu for each of the 30 storm sets from cfsr ct ccsm4 bl ccsm4 f1 and ccsm4 f2 this hypothetical discharge scenario is mainly used to identify the maximum possible downstream flood inundation area reduction under the most optimistic flood management operation given that the actual reservoir operation is unlikely to beat this optimal scenario the actual pmf inundation area under the protection of a reservoir should be within the range between me02 and me02r 2 3 probabilistic flood map for each simulated pmf flood event realization the flood2d gpu simulation outputs were stored at a 10 minute temporal resolution for the duration of the flood these outputs were first post processed to obtain the maximum flood inundation extents arising from the event a minimum threshold of 10 cm flood depth was used to differentiate a cell as flooded vs not flooded kalyanapu 2011 during the post processing step using the maximum flood inundation extents for every flood event as an input the probabilistic value of flooding for any given cell was then calculated using eq 1 kalyanapu et al 2012 given that these moisture maximized storms were selected by the 30 largest storms within a 30 year period rastogi et al 2017 each storm is weighed equally in this study this approach was used to produce one pfm for each of the storm sets i e cfsr ct ccsm4 bl ccsm4 f1 and ccsm4 f2 for both me01 and me02 1 p cell i 1 i n x i n where pcell probability to flood for any given cell xi 0 dry or 1 wet for realization i n total number of realizations flood event simulations the pfm presents a spatial map of conditional probability of flooding given a moisture maximized extreme storm event has occurred at the region of interest the pfms were generated for the two model domains me01 and me02 for each of the 30 storm sets for cfsr ct ccsm4 bl ccsm4 f1 and ccsm4 f2 the flood simulations are referenced by adding the subscript me01 me02 and me02r after the name of the storm set for example cfsr ct me01 cfsr ct me02 and cfsr ct me02r refer to pfms generated for cfsr ct storms for model domains me01 and me02 under natural flow and me02 under reservoir regulation respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 flood2d gpu performance the performance of flood2d gpu was evaluated by comparing the simulated 100 year flood inundation extents against a benchmark data set from fema 100 year flood zones or zone a ae wing et al 2017 alfieri et al 2014 for me01 the first step in the process involved the estimation of a 100 year peak streamflow q100 through standard frequency analysis at the outlet of me01 using guidelines from bulletin 17b prepared by the interagency advisory committee on water data 1982 the continuous streamflow data from the control simulation i e dhsvm driven using observed historic precipitation from daymet for a period of 32 years 1981 2012 served as inputs for frequency analysis the annual maximum series ams of peak discharge qmax year was extracted from the hydrograph at the outlet of me01 a log pearson type iii distribution was then fitted to the ams using a skewness parameter obtained for the region based on plate 1 of bulletin 17b the results from the flood frequency analysis are illustrated in fig 2 based on the annual maximum peak discharges for a period of 32 years we obtain a q100 value of 18 956 ft3 s at the outlet of me01 in the next step we employed an ensemble based approach to validate flood2d gpu as a single storm might not be able to capture the spatial variability across the watershed and might result in underestimation of flood extents for each annual maximum peak discharge event the hydrographs at each inflow location fig 1 were abstracted i e 32 events from 1981 through 2012 these hydrographs were then re scaled to match the estimated 100 year peak discharge value and served as inputs to flood2d gpu to conduct the simulation at 30 m spatial resolution the rescaling of the hydrographs was performed by multiplying the hydrographs by a rescaling factor ryr calculated at each year as ryr q100 qmax yr so that the peak streamflow at the domain outlet of each simulation is controlled at the same q100 value this approach retains the relative streamflow magnitude across all tributaries and allows us exploring the spatial variability and uncertainty across the ensemble members the ensemble simulation resulted in 32 flood inundation maps the maximum inundation area was then identified from the 32 maps and compared against a fema 100 year flood map rasterized to the same 30 m resolution the flood maps were compared based on a binary flooded 1 not flooded 0 classification scheme as presented in table 2 the comparison was performed for the analysis domain me01 and the smaller stream segments that had no inflow locations because of modeling constraints limitations were excluded the vector based fema flood extents for the region of interest were rasterized to the flood2d gpu grid to enable a direct comparison fig 3 presents a comparison of 100 year flood inundation extents obtained from flood2d gpu and fema a visual inspection reveals that the 100 year flood zones simulated by flood2d gpu are largely consistent with the fema flood zones while there may also be inaccuracies and uncertainties associated with fema flood zones this study uses the fema data as a benchmark to evaluate the overall reasonableness of flood2d gpu four key metrics including critical success c hit rate h false alarm f and error e were estimated to quantify flood2d gpu performance table 3 h provides a measure of the model to accurately predict benchmark flood extents however it does not penalize for overprediction flood2d gpu obtained h 0 82 for me01 revealing the model can accurately predict 82 of the fema flood zones f which measures overprediction is estimated as 0 17 demonstrating that 17 of the grid cells were falsely reported as flooded by the model the c equivalent to the f squared statistics a common metric to evaluate spatial extents for flood studies bates and de roo 2000 is estimated as 0 70 providing an overall measure of fit the c metric adds a penalty to h for any overprediction and underprediction in addition the fact that e for flood2d gpu is less than 1 0 93 suggests an overall tendency of the model to underpredict predominantly in the upstream reaches close to inflow boundary conditions these key metrics suggest that flood2d gpu performance is on a par with the acceptable range of these metrics provided in the literature alfieri et al 2014 wing et al 2017 for instance alfieri et al 2014 obtained h values between 0 59 and 0 78 and c values between 0 43 and 0 65 for a flood simulation at 100 m resolution across selected areas in germany and the united kingdom compared with national regional hazard maps wing et al 2017 performed a similar evaluation for validation of a flood hazard model for the conterminous us using fema flood zones as a benchmark with h values as 0 685 and 0 815 and c values of 0 55 and 0 50 for 90 m and 30 m spatial resolutions respectively the results indicate overall satisfactory performance of the flood2d gpu in comparing spatial extents for 1 in 100 year event against the equivalent flood inundation zone obtained from fema 3 2 ensemble pmf hydrographs and comparison with deterministic approach this section presents the ensemble pmf hydrographs for each of the four sets of moisture maximized storms i e cfsr ct ccsm4 bl ccsm4 f1 and ccsm4 f2 at the outlet of the etowah watershed fig 4 the hydrographs with the largest peak discharge are presented in thick lines in fig 4 and are individually presented in fig 5 a for further comparison the pmf hydrograph from the conventional approach hmr based is also presented for the etowah watershed fig 5a the range of peak discharge values for these events is presented in fig 5b for etowah watershed and at the outlets of computational flood2d domains me01 and me02 in fig 5c and d respectively the results indicate that peak discharges obtained for ccsm4 bl and hmr are comparable in magnitude with maximum peak discharge values of 21 874 m3 s and 18 654 m3 s respectively although the deterministic hmr peak discharge is less than the maximum event in each set of the hydrographs it is larger than more than 75 of the ensemble members and lies among the top quartile of all events in addition the hmr based deterministic peak discharge is 82 larger than the ensemble mean peak discharge of all ccsm4 bl members table 4 suggesting the relative magnitude of the deterministic hmr approach the maximum peak discharge for cfsr ct 27 732 m3 s is greater than for ccsm4 bl this higher discharge could be attributed to higher pmp estimates for cfsr ct demonstrating the effect of the choice of meteorological forcings on pmf gangrade et al 2018 the effects of climate change on maximum peak discharge indicate a significant increase in peak discharge magnitude with an increase of approximately 58 for the near future time period ccsm4 f1 2021 2050 and 109 for the far future period ccsm4 f2 2071 2100 the comparison is performed with reference to the peak discharge magnitude obtained for the baseline period ccsm4 bl these changes could be attributed to increased pmp estimates projected in the future periods resulting from the intensification of the hydrologic cycle caused by atmospheric warming readers are referred to rastogi et al 2017 and gangrade et al 2018 for further technical details the results demonstrate a large variability in the hydrograph shapes and peak discharge values figs 4 5b d in addition to the key factor e g pmp magnitude the variability in the hydrographs can be attributed to spatiotemporal rainfall structure and watershed heterogeneity the results also highlight the range of uncertainties captured in terms of streamflow estimates which are often missing in the conventional deterministic estimation of pmf here we mainly focus on the range of streamflow variability that corresponds to a set of moisture maximized storms similar concepts can also be followed to develop ensemble hydrographs that address other possible sources of uncertainties e g timing parameterization 3 3 development of probabilistic flood maps an ensemble based approach involves analyzing a collection of simulated flood events corresponding to multiple hydrographs and peak discharge magnitudes generally the most extreme or worst case scenario is selected by choosing the single pmf hydrograph with the maximum peak discharge in this section we analyze the effects of ensemble pmf in terms of flood inundation area by translating these hydrographs into probabilistic flood inundation maps and comparing the results with flood extents obtained via the conventional deterministic approach this comparison is intended to illustrate flood damages extents resulting from pmf events and associated uncertainties the pfms are presented for each of the 30 moisture maximized storms fig 6 panels a through d for me01 panels e through h for me02 and panels i through l for me02r the results are presented in term of conditional probability of flooding for a given cell assuming a moisture maximized storm has occurred in the region panels a and e also include the deterministic flood extents obtained from flood2d gpu driven by conventional hmr pmf presented as white contours overlaid on top of the probabilistic flood maps in addition the range of maximum flood inundation area associated with each storm event is presented in fig 7 for me01 panel a me02 under natural flow condition panel b and me02r under ideal reservoir regulation panel c a comparison of the maximum flood inundation extent for the domain upstream of allatoona lake and dam me01 fig 6a obtained by the conventional hmr based approach 15 56 km2 is very similar to the maximum flooding extent of cfsr ct me01 16 83 km2 and ccsm4 bl me01 16 32 km2 resulting in 8 2 and 4 9 respective increments in inundation area compared with hmr on the other hand the downstream domain me02 fig 6e has a larger difference in flood extent obtained from the hmr approach 96 6 km2 compared with the maximum flood extents of cfsr ct me02 117 9 km2 and ccsm4 bl me02 101 5 km2 the results are 22 1 and 5 1 respective increments in inundation area compared with hmr a comparison of panels 6e and 6i in fig 6 reveals the maximum possible flood reduction by the allatoona reservoir due to its regulation of pmf scale events in the immediate downstream areas ideal reservoir operation results in a decrease in the maximum flood inundation area of 9 5 in the cfsr ct case given the projected future climate conditions the simulated maximum inundation area reveals a likely increase in both near future ccsm4 f1 and far future ccsm4 f2 periods for me01 the projected maximum inundation areas are 17 6 km2 for ccsm4 f1 and 19 1 km2 for ccsm4 f2 which suggest 8 and 17 increases when compared with the 16 3 km2 ccsm4 bl m01 baseline value fig 7a similarly a total of 121 2 km2 108 7 km2 and 135 7 km2 128 4 km2 in the maximum inundation area is projected for me02 me02r for ccsm4 f1 and ccsm4 f2 and they suggest 19 22 and 34 44 increases when compared with the 101 5 km2 88 9 km2 ccsm4 bl me02 ccsm4 bl me02r baseline value the results indicate that the percentage increase in maximum inundation area is projected to be higher for me02r than for me02 mainly due to a smaller me02r baseline value given the wide range of areal extents produced for each set of moisture maximized storms further insight into flood characteristics e g flood inundation area gauge height using hydrologic meteorological parameters can improve the understanding of flood zones the relationship between peak discharge and maximum flood inundation area is presented in fig 8 although the maximum flood inundation area is highly correlated to the peak discharge at the outlet of each model the relationship is nonlinear with a higher variance observed for me02 fig 8b than for me01 fig 8a this finding was mainly attributed to the relatively flat topography in me02 the variability demonstrates that a similar peak discharge could result in varying extents of flood inundation which could be attributed to hydrograph characteristics including timing sequence and total flood volume and spatial variations in streamflow for instance two storms with maximum peak discharges of 11 112 m3 s and 11 504 m3 s respectively can produce maximum flood inundation areas of 102 1 km2 and 81 32 km2 for me02 fig 8b the results suggest that a single peak discharge value for pmf obtained using the conventional approach cannot capture such variations in flood impacts the results further highlight the value of an ensemble based approach compared with current deterministic methods for more comprehensive understanding of flood damage resulting from an extreme event 3 4 potential changes in flood impacts arising from pmf in this section we use the pfm to examine the potential changes in the flood regime and its impacts on infrastructure urban developments under projected future climate conditions to illustrate how the conditional probability of flooding due to moisture maximized storms changes in different periods the difference in probability of flooding at each grid among ccsm4 bl ccsm4 f1 and ccsm4 f2 for each domain me01 me02 and me02r was calculated and is summarized in fig 9 the grid cells that are consistently flooded i e probability 1 or non flooded i e probability 0 in all inundation maps across all storms ccsm4 bl ccsm4 f1 and ccsm4 f2 were excluded from the analysis the results indicate that the overall probability of flooding will increase by up to 30 in ccsm4 f1 across me01 me02 and me02r where most grid cells show increasing probability ranging between 0 and 0 15 similarly the histogram for ccsm4 f2 indicates that the overall probability of flooding will increase by up to 60 for ccsm4 f2 for each domain me01 me02 and me02r with most cells showing positive increases ranging between 0 and 0 25 this process allows the identification of other areas that may be more susceptible to pmf scale flooding in addition to the most vulnerable areas i e probability 1 to demonstrate the potential application of this framework the analysis was further expanded to demonstrate the utility of pfms as a tool to identify potential hazards to electricity grid infrastructure arising from pmf events the vulnerability of 16 selected electric substations from the homeland infrastructure foundation level data fig 1 for me02 was evaluated and additional ensemble information such as duration of flooding and median flood depths is presented in fig 10 these results identify the substations at risk of flooding given a pmf event has occurred of 16 substations 8 substations 6 7 9 10 12 13 14 and 15 demonstrated a high probability of flooding 0 75 for me02 under unregulated flow condition for ccsm4 bl the mean duration of flooding and median flood depths is likely to show an increase in ccsm4 f1 and ccsm4 f2 compared with ccsm4 bl similarly the substations currently not at risk of flooding in ccsm4 bl for instance 1 2 3 5 and 8 have a higher chance of flooding in future time periods i e ccsm4 f1 and ccsm4 f2 further additional information from the ensemble approach such as distribution of duration of flooding and median floods depths has the potential to reduce the likelihood of type i and type ii decision errors in risk management such risk identification research can help improve current flood mitigation features while also equipping decision makers with information that can be used in strategic planning and development of future urban areas and or critical infrastructure 3 5 sensitivity analysis to understand the overall and relative sensitivity of flood inundation to various factors such as meteorological forcings climate change hydraulic and hydrologic model inputs and parameters a comprehensive sensitivity test was performed as explained in table 5 the simulation results from scenarios s2 through s7 are compared with reference to the control scenario s1 in fig 11 the relative sensitivity reveals that climate change s3a and s3b and meteorological forcings s2a are the most sensitive factors for flood inundation area and the median flood depths for me02 climate change is likely to cause increases of up to 33 7 and 46 5 in inundated area and median flood depth respectively these differences in inundation areas for the aforementioned scenarios can be attributed mainly to changes in pmp values revealing that precipitation is the most sensitive factor affecting flood regimes reservoir operations s7 can also contribute moderately by reducing the overall flood inundation area by approximately 13 2 compared with s1 note that the reduction is calculated under an ideal reservoir operation scenario and will be directly controlled by the maximum storage capacity of the reservoir the other two sensitive parameters in this order include the effects of antecedent moisture conditions in the hydrologic model s6 and the effects of using a high resolution dem s4 they produce relative changes of 8 6 and 6 7 respectively for the inundation area the effect of the manning s roughness coefficient was found to be the least sensitive factor in this case a similar trend was also noticed for median flood depths it should be noted that a minimum depth threshold of 10 cm was utilized to calculate the maximum inundation area post hydrodynamic simulation we also repeated our analysis using a 1 cm threshold which lead to minimal impacts for our watershed however it can have a stronger influence in flat topographies or other regions 4 summary and conclusions this study demonstrates a high resolution process based hydro meteorological modeling framework to generate ensemble based pfms for two selected domains for the worst case flood scenarios i e pmf an ensemble of 120 moisture maximized pmp storms were acquired from rastogi et al 2017 for historical time period and future climate projections pmf estimates were then generated by driving dhsvm at a 90 m grid resolution the 3 hour hydrographs obtained from dhsvm for each storm were used to drive a 2d gpu accelerated hydraulic model flood2d gpu at 30 m and 10 m spatial resolutions to produce flood maps for each storm the probability of inundation was then calculated at each grid cell of the flood domain which was then used to generate pfms further the relative sensitivity of flood inundation area and median flood depth was evaluated for various factors such as meteorological forcings climate change antecedent moisture conditions and hydraulic model inputs and parameters the results indicate that the peak discharge from the pmf hydrograph is likely to increase significantly for the etowah watershed region under a changing climate the region downstream of allatoona lake is likely to observe an increase of up to 58 in peak discharge magnitude in the near future period 2021 2050 ccsm4 f1 and up to 109 in the far future period 2071 2100 ccsm4 f2 under rcp8 5 compared with the baseline period 1981 2010 ccsm4 ct these changes in pmf translate into approximately 19 and 33 increases in the flood inundation area an evaluation of probabilistic inundation maps revealed that the probability of flooding is likely to increase by up to 30 and 60 respectively under the near future and far future scenarios for the 16 selected electrical substations the vulnerability assessment suggests that over 50 of the selected substations have more than 75 probability of flooding during pmf events in the baseline period the probability of flooding increases significantly in the projected near and far future periods for far future scenario ccsm4 f2 all substations are projected to be inundated in at least one of the ensemble simulations additionally the high resolution outputs may also provide additional information such as duration of flooding and flood depths under these scenarios the relative sensitivity experiments further demonstrated that precipitation is the most sensitive factor affecting the flood regime including flood inundation areas and depth the choice of meteorological forcings can contribute to up to a 16 change in the flood inundation area further the flood inundation elasticity relationships developed between peak streamflow and corresponding flood inundation area revealed the uncertainties associated with the shape and timing of hydrographs originating from the spatiotemporal variability in precipitation and the watershed heterogeneity the proposed hydro meteorological modeling framework can enable the generation of probabilistic flood inundation maps through ensemble based pmp and pmf simulation the uncertainties associated with the most sensitive factor i e extreme precipitation and others can be successfully captured with an ensemble approach as presented in this study the comprehensive relative sensitivity analysis and its effects on flood regime further identify the most important factors causing changes to flood regimes although the study focused on a particular huc08 basin the framework can be extended to other regions to generate ensemble based probabilistic flood inundation maps these maps can serve as an important tool and provide ensemble based information regarding key flood characteristics including flood depth and duration to decision makers rather than deterministic values obtained from the conventional approach such an evaluation of a region not only determines the regions under flood risk but also informs stakeholders regarding the probability of inundation to enable informed decisions declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments sg and sck were supported by the hydro research foundation and us department of energy

6297,the magnitude and frequency of hydro meteorological extremes are expected to increase in a changing environment in ways that threaten the security of us energy water assets these include probable maximum precipitation pmp and probable maximum flood pmf which are used as hydraulic design standards for highly sensitive infrastructures such as nuclear power plants and main dams to assess the flood vulnerability due to pmp pmf an integrated high resolution process based hydro meteorologic modeling framework was used to develop ensemble based probabilistic flood maps based on best available historic observations and future climate projections a graphics processing unit accelerated 2 dimensional hydrodynamic model was used to simulate the surface inundation areas corresponding to a total of 120 pmf hydrographs these ensemble based pmf maps were compared with flood maps obtained from the conventional deterministic pmp pmf approach revealing added information about conditional probability of flooding further a relative sensitivity test was conducted to explore the effects of various factors in the framework such as meteorological forcings antecedent hydrologic conditions reservoir storage and flood model input resolution and parameters the proposed framework better illustrates the uncertainties associated with model inputs parameterization and hydro meteorological factors allowing more informed decision making for future emergency preparation keywords flood modeling graphics processing units gpu probable maximum precipitation pmp probable maximum flood pmf

observed 29 billion dollar scale flood events in the period of 1980 2018 with a total of 543 deaths and roughly 122 billion dollars in inflation adjusted losses ncei 2018 the increasing frequency and magnitude of flood events under changing climate population and land use and land cover conditions require better predictability and preparedness for flood hazards flood inundation maps serve as a

similar inundation maps developed for pmf scale events may serve as useful tools to evaluate the vulnerability of critical infrastructures under worst case flooding scenarios as well as to identify regions with minimum flooding likelihood to support future site selection a general procedure to prepare flood inundation maps hereinafter referred as a modeling chain associated with pmf involves probable maximum precipitation pmp estimation followed by hydrologic simulation and hydrodynamic hydraulic modeling since the current practice of pmp pmf assessment focuses on estimating the single deterministic maximum precipitation and streamflow event that could occur under a series of adverse hydro meteorological conditions conventional pmf inundation maps are also deterministic in nature however deterministic maps inevitably mask out underlying uncertainties from decision makers or planners given the binary wet or dry representation of the resulting flood inundation maps while advanced deterministic maps employ process based hydrologic and hydraulic models calibrated to historic events di baldassarre et al 2010 these maps are unable to capture the uncertainties arising from various other sources in the modeling chain such as inaccurate input data boundary conditions model structure and model parameterization alfonso et al 2016 di baldassarre et al 2010 therefore the value and potential of probabilistic flood maps pfms have been highlighted recently in the literature alfonso et al 2016 di baldassarre et al 2010 papaioannou et al 2017 recent advances in computational power have allowed the use of computationally intensive hydrologic hydraulic models to develop pfms through multi ensemble simulation neal et al 2013 the uncertainty characterization may be performed at various stages of the modeling chain by varying factors such as precipitation caseri et al 2016 spatiotemporal rainfall variability jenkins et al 2017 nuswantoro et al 2016 zischg et al 2018 spatial dependence of flow from tributaries neal et al 2013 pattison et al 2014 hydrologic model parameters or inputs domeneghetti et al 2013 hydraulic model types papaioannou et al 2016 hydraulic model roughness coefficient papaioannou et al 2017 and different digital elevation models and observational data sets giustarini et al 2016 papaioannou et al 2016 although a few studies have focused on the development of flood inundation maps for the largest historic events e g pedrozo acuña et al 2015 or for events with return periods ranging from hundreds smemoe et al 2007 kalyanapu et al 2012 to thousands of years büchele et al 2006 prime et al 2016 studies evaluating flood inundation maps for rare hydroclimatic extreme events such as pmp pmf are limited zischg et al 2018 further recent studies have suggested that pmp pmf are sensitive to the changing climatic conditions e g kunkel et al 2013 beauchamp et al 2013 rousseau et al 2014 stratz and hossain 2014 klein et al 2016 rastogi et al 2017 gangrade et al 2018 and challenged the deterministic treatment of pmp pmf it has also been suggested that both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties are involved in the estimation of pmp micovic et al 2015 for instance pmp and pmf estimates are often derived for a point location of interest without considering variability originating from spatiotemporal rainfall distribution or watershed heterogeneity through monte carlo simulation zischg et al 2018 demonstrated that the spatiotemporal distribution of pmp has significant effects on the resulting pmf inundation maps other factors such as meteorological forcings antecedent soil moisture land use land cover conditions and reservoir operation gangrade et al 2018 may introduce further uncertainties to the pmf estimate and consequently the resulting surface inundation area the 2017 hurricane harvey precipitation near houston texas is reported to exceed the hydrometeorological report no 51 hmr51 schreiner and riedel 1978 72 h pmp estimates at 5000 mi2 and 10 000 mi2 scales kao et al 2019 suggesting that an extremely large pmp scale storm is physically possible considering that there has not been a focused federal effort since the publication of hmrs it is of critical importance to advance our concept and practice from the conventional deterministic treatment of pmp pmf to an ensemble based probabilistic flood mapping approach to better analyze and quantify the vulnerability of critical energy water infrastructures in a changing environment in this study building upon our prior work involving pmp pmf simulations rastogi et al 2017 gangrade et al 2018 we present a high resolution process based hydro meteorological modeling framework to produce probabilistic flood inundation maps for pmf the main objectives of the study are 1 to employ an ensemble based approach to translate uncertainties associated with pmp to flood inundation maps 2 to prepare probabilistic flood inundation maps illustrating uncertainties with the flood hazard modeling chain of pmf and 3 to quantify the potential impacts of environmental change on the inundation areas of pmf the study area includes areas immediately upstream and downstream of the allatoona dam in georgia us for pmp we used weather research forecasting wrf a numerical weather simulation model skamarock et al 2008 to create an ensemble of 120 storms the input forcings to the wrf model is provided by reanalysis as well as climate projections as detailed in rastogi et al 2017 these 120 pmp storms were then used to conduct pmf estimates using the distributed hydrologic soil vegetation model dhsvm wigmosta et al 1994 as described by gangrade et al 2018 the ensemble of pmf hydrographs was further used to drive a high resolution graphics processing unit gpu accelerated 2 dimensional 2d dynamic wave flood model flood2d gpu kalyanapu et al 2011 to simulate the spatiotemporal evolution of pmf and to develop ensemble based pfms apart from better quantifying uncertainties compared with the deterministic approach the ensemble based flood mapping approach allowed us to better visualize the potential impacts of pmf through a spatially explicit more intuitive manner this study is the first of its kind that implements a high resolution modeling framework to assess changes in flood regime through an ensemble based approach for pmf to account for a changing climate and other factors the study also includes a relative sensitivity experiment to evaluate the sensitivity of various factors in the modeling chain including inputs such as precipitation hydrologic model antecedent conditions and hydraulic model parameters although the proposed study is presented for a selected watershed the methodology can also be adopted for other locations with similar climates and geographical settings for broader applications this study is organized as follows section 2 provides an overview of the study area methodology and data section 3 presents results and associated discussion and section 4 summarizes and concludes the study 2 methods 2 1 study area this study focuses on the etowah watershed located in the northwestern georgia us we selected this watershed because it includes a major reservoir and urban areas and lies in a relatively flat topographic region allowing transposition of pmp storms the etowah watershed has an estimated drainage area of 4821 km2 1861 mi2 fig 1 and is a part of the alabama coosa tallapoosa act river basin it drains parts of 15 counties in georgia and covers major urban areas including the city of cartersville and parts of atlanta s metropolitan area such as woodstock marietta and alpharetta the etowah watershed includes a large multi purpose reservoir allatoona lake and dam owned and operated by the us army corps of engineers usace with a maximum storage capacity of roughly 826 5 million m3 the second largest dam in the act river basin while the headwaters of etowah watershed include mountainous areas such as the piedmont mountains the topography of the rest of the watershed is moderate with elevations ranging from 176 m 577 ft to 1147 m 3763 ft as per the national elevation dataset ned gesch et al 2002 the region receives roughly 1336 mm of annual precipitation predominantly in the form of rainfall with light snowfall in the headwater region the major soil types include silty loam and sandy loam according to the national land cover database 2006 fry et al 2011 61 of the basin is covered by forests 18 5 lies under small vegetation and 18 5 falls in the developed category the main critical infrastructure located in the etowah watershed is the allatoona dam which produces hydroelectric power for the region the pmfs developed through the wrf and dhsvm cover both the upstream and downstream areas of the allatoona lake and dam to further demonstrate the applicability of probabilistic flood maps for other energy infrastructures we also evaluate 16 selected electrical substations obtained from homeland infrastructure foundation level data fig 1 in the watershed four different types of modeling analysis domains were used in this study the wrf meteorological and dhsvm hydrologic modeling domains covered the etowah watershed as well as the entire act river basin see rastogi et al 2017 and gangrade et al 2018 for domain details two flood2d gpu modeling domains i e 358 km2 me01 flood2d gpu and 507 km2 me02 flood2d gpu in fig 1 were set up within the etowah watershed and final analysis was performed for two slightly smaller analysis domains me01 and me02 the two regions upstream me01 and immediately downstream me02 from allatoona dam were selected such that they cover parts of the atlanta metropolitan region and the city of cartersville in the etowah watershed the computational domains of flood2d gpu were set to be larger than the analysis domains to avoid potential backwater effects and computational domain boundary artifacts 2 2 simulation setup we used a process based high resolution modeling framework to develop multi ensemble flood inundation maps associated with pmf estimates the main steps involved 1 simulation of pmp storms 2 simulation of pmf hydrographs and 3 simulation of flood regimes a brief overview of the methods follows 2 2 1 simulation of pmp the simulation of pmp storms was performed using a mesoscale numerical weather model wrf version 3 6 the wrf model is driven using boundary forcings from a a reanalysis dataset climate forecast system reanalysis i cfsr saha et al 2010 and b a global climate model community climate system model version 4 ccsm4 gent et al 2011 the wrf model setup at a 9 km and 3 km double nested horizonal grid resolutions was driven for 120 selected storms table 1 using the relative humidity maximization rhm method to simulate pmp before pmp estimation wrf parameterization was selected by testing the simulated 3 day rainfall depth against the prism daly et al 2008 and daymet thornton et al 1997 precipitation datasets to assess and compare wrf performance pmp was then estimated using the selected parameterization with the rhm method which maximizes the relative humidity of the entire atmospheric column to 100 at initial and boundary conditions following ohara et al 2011 and ishida et al 2015 the pmp outputs were stored at 1 hourly temporal resolution the readers are referred to rastogi et al 2017 for further technical details regarding pmp estimation and wrf performance evaluation in addition hydrometeorological report hmr 51 schreiner and riedel 1978 and hmr52 usace 1984 were used to obtain conventional pmp rainfall estimates for the study area this enables a comparison of ensemble based simulations with the conventional deterministic approach and serves as a reference the ensemble approach relies on identifying the most critical pmf event based on hydrologic and hydraulic simulations for each of the pmp storms as opposed to one deterministic event under conventional approach estimated using synthetic hyetographs the ensemble based approach leads to better understanding of the uncertainty associated with pmp estimates 2 2 2 simulation of pmf the pmf simulations were conducted by using each of the 120 moisture maximized storms as the meteorological forcing input to drive a high resolution dhsvm dhsvm was selected because of its wide applications in hydroclimate impact assessments and its capability to generate high resolution streamflow data required to drive the consequent hydrodynamic flood models dhsvm is a distributed process based model and performs water energy balance calculations to account for various hydrological processes the model uses precipitation air temperature radiation both longwave and shortwave wind speed and relative humidity as input datasets wigmosta et al 1994 and 2002 storck et al 1998 the dhsvm setup for the etowah watershed was obtained from gangrade et al 2018 which is a part of a larger modeling effort performed for the act river basin the dhsvm simulation was performed at the 3 hourly time step and 90 m horizontal grid resolution from 1980 2012 the 90 m ned is used as the base digital elevation model dem map for dhsvm simulation further the soil miller and white 1998 and land use and land cover data nlcd fry et al 2011 were resampled at the base map resolution to serve as inputs to hydrologic simulation the stream network was obtained from the national hydrography dataset plus mckay et al 2012 readers are referred to gangrade et al 2018 for associated detailed technical descriptions regarding setup calibration and validation to simulate pmf specifically for the etowah watershed for every storm listed in table 1 section 2 2 1 the largest 72 h average precipitation which is the largest duration commonly used by hmr reports to estimate pmp over the watershed was identified from the wrf output and transpositioned to the center of the etowah watershed as an input for dhsvm given the relatively smooth topography in the act river basin compared with other mountainous regions in the us storms within the basin can be considered meteorologically transpositionable this enables identification of the most critical pmp input for the study area and ensures that the pmp storm is captured by the watershed the simulated precipitation depth from the most inner wrf domain as explained in section 2 2 1 was further re gridded aggregated as 3 hourly inputs to dhsvm at a 4 km horizontal grid resolution radar rainfall format following the nuclear regulatory commission guidelines a critical meteorological sequence was used for pmf estimation prasad et al 2011 the meteorological sequence included 40 of 72 hr pmp antecedent precipitation followed by no precipitation for 72 hours and then a full 100 72 hr pmp critical precipitation fully saturated moisture conditions were used at the beginning of the dhsvm simulations this approach provides an ensemble of simulated dhsvm streamflow hydrographs for each set of storms sets as specified in table 1 i e cfsr ct ccsm4 bl ccsm4 f1 and ccsm4 f2 the ensemble pmf hydrographs obtained above were also compared against conventional pmf driven by conventional pmp rainfall estimates calculated for etowah watershed using hmr51 and hmr52 the detailed methodology is described in gangrade et al 2018 2 2 3 simulation of flood regime the hydrodynamic flood simulation was performed using the computationally enhanced version of the 2d hydraulic model flood2d gpu marshall et al 2018 originally developed by kalyanapu et al 2011 flood2d gpu uses a first order accurate upwind finite difference scheme in solving the nonlinear hyperbolic shallow water saint venant equations which are a simplified version of the navier stokes equations with horizontal momentum and continuity equations integrated over water depth the model implements on a structured grid to take advantage of the uniform grid structure of the dem data the computational performance of the flood2d gpu model was improved using a hybrid message passing interface mpi and compute unified device architecture cuda the model speed up for the mpi multiple gpu version was up to 18 compared with an identical single process open multi processing openmp version marshall et al 2018 benefitting from gpu acceleration the high performance of flood2d gpu allowed us to perform ensemble simulation for two domains me01 400 000 grid cells 360 km2 and me02 563 000 grid cells 507 km2 the simulations were conducted on the titan supercomputer maintained by the oak ridge leadership computing facility and used 1 million computing hours for ensemble flood simulation the key input data required for flood2d gpu include dem surface roughness manning s n value inflow source locations and the corresponding streamflow hydrographs in this study both 30 m and 10 m resolution dem data were obtained from ned we tested several commonly used manning s n values and selected 0 035 as the default value discussed in section 3 for the selection of inflow locations fig 1 we first identified the main upstream nhdplus channel segments that flow into the flood2d gpu simulation domain we then selected a series of additional nhdplus segments with approximately 50 km2 incremental drainage areas to input the incremental streamflow hydrographs the corresponding hydrographs for each of the 120 storms were extracted using high resolution hydrologic outputs from dhsvm at 3 h time steps for both domains i e me01 and me02 the flood2d gpu was driven by 5 day hydrographs that capture the peak discharge of each storm event and the output was stored at a 10 minute temporal resolution for each storm the flood2d gpu performance is evaluated and presented in the results and discussion section the current model setup captures riverine or fluvial floods the pluvial flood simulation an important aspect for flood map generation to support decision making shall be incorporated in the future model improvements apart from the default simulations driven by simulated pmf hydrographs an additional set of 120 flood simulations were conducted for me02 downstream of allatoona dam with modified upstream inflow to understand the maximum flood retention capacity under idealized reservoir operation denoted as me02r at the stream segment immediately downstream of the allatoona lake and dam the volume equal to the maximum storage capacity of the allatoona reservoir i e 826 5 million m3 was subtracted from the peak of the pmf hydrograph in other words this me02r simulation assumes that the reservoir can be fully emptied right before a pmf event remains structurally intact throughout the entire event and is operated optimally to reduce the peak discharge of a pmf event the modified hydrograph in addition to natural flow from other tributaries served as an input for me02 to drive flood2d gpu for each of the 30 storm sets from cfsr ct ccsm4 bl ccsm4 f1 and ccsm4 f2 this hypothetical discharge scenario is mainly used to identify the maximum possible downstream flood inundation area reduction under the most optimistic flood management operation given that the actual reservoir operation is unlikely to beat this optimal scenario the actual pmf inundation area under the protection of a reservoir should be within the range between me02 and me02r 2 3 probabilistic flood map for each simulated pmf flood event realization the flood2d gpu simulation outputs were stored at a 10 minute temporal resolution for the duration of the flood these outputs were first post processed to obtain the maximum flood inundation extents arising from the event a minimum threshold of 10 cm flood depth was used to differentiate a cell as flooded vs not flooded kalyanapu 2011 during the post processing step using the maximum flood inundation extents for every flood event as an input the probabilistic value of flooding for any given cell was then calculated using eq 1 kalyanapu et al 2012 given that these moisture maximized storms were selected by the 30 largest storms within a 30 year period rastogi et al 2017 each storm is weighed equally in this study this approach was used to produce one pfm for each of the storm sets i e cfsr ct ccsm4 bl ccsm4 f1 and ccsm4 f2 for both me01 and me02 1 p cell i 1 i n x i n where pcell probability to flood for any given cell xi 0 dry or 1 wet for realization i n total number of realizations flood event simulations the pfm presents a spatial map of conditional probability of flooding given a moisture maximized extreme storm event has occurred at the region of interest the pfms were generated for the two model domains me01 and me02 for each of the 30 storm sets for cfsr ct ccsm4 bl ccsm4 f1 and ccsm4 f2 the flood simulations are referenced by adding the subscript me01 me02 and me02r after the name of the storm set for example cfsr ct me01 cfsr ct me02 and cfsr ct me02r refer to pfms generated for cfsr ct storms for model domains me01 and me02 under natural flow and me02 under reservoir regulation respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 flood2d gpu performance the performance of flood2d gpu was evaluated by comparing the simulated 100 year flood inundation extents against a benchmark data set from fema 100 year flood zones or zone a ae wing et al 2017 alfieri et al 2014 for me01 the first step in the process involved the estimation of a 100 year peak streamflow q100 through standard frequency analysis at the outlet of me01 using guidelines from bulletin 17b prepared by the interagency advisory committee on water data 1982 the continuous streamflow data from the control simulation i e dhsvm driven using observed historic precipitation from daymet for a period of 32 years 1981 2012 served as inputs for frequency analysis the annual maximum series ams of peak discharge qmax year was extracted from the hydrograph at the outlet of me01 a log pearson type iii distribution was then fitted to the ams using a skewness parameter obtained for the region based on plate 1 of bulletin 17b the results from the flood frequency analysis are illustrated in fig 2 based on the annual maximum peak discharges for a period of 32 years we obtain a q100 value of 18 956 ft3 s at the outlet of me01 in the next step we employed an ensemble based approach to validate flood2d gpu as a single storm might not be able to capture the spatial variability across the watershed and might result in underestimation of flood extents for each annual maximum peak discharge event the hydrographs at each inflow location fig 1 were abstracted i e 32 events from 1981 through 2012 these hydrographs were then re scaled to match the estimated 100 year peak discharge value and served as inputs to flood2d gpu to conduct the simulation at 30 m spatial resolution the rescaling of the hydrographs was performed by multiplying the hydrographs by a rescaling factor ryr calculated at each year as ryr q100 qmax yr so that the peak streamflow at the domain outlet of each simulation is controlled at the same q100 value this approach retains the relative streamflow magnitude across all tributaries and allows us exploring the spatial variability and uncertainty across the ensemble members the ensemble simulation resulted in 32 flood inundation maps the maximum inundation area was then identified from the 32 maps and compared against a fema 100 year flood map rasterized to the same 30 m resolution the flood maps were compared based on a binary flooded 1 not flooded 0 classification scheme as presented in table 2 the comparison was performed for the analysis domain me01 and the smaller stream segments that had no inflow locations because of modeling constraints limitations were excluded the vector based fema flood extents for the region of interest were rasterized to the flood2d gpu grid to enable a direct comparison fig 3 presents a comparison of 100 year flood inundation extents obtained from flood2d gpu and fema a visual inspection reveals that the 100 year flood zones simulated by flood2d gpu are largely consistent with the fema flood zones while there may also be inaccuracies and uncertainties associated with fema flood zones this study uses the fema data as a benchmark to evaluate the overall reasonableness of flood2d gpu four key metrics including critical success c hit rate h false alarm f and error e were estimated to quantify flood2d gpu performance table 3 h provides a measure of the model to accurately predict benchmark flood extents however it does not penalize for overprediction flood2d gpu obtained h 0 82 for me01 revealing the model can accurately predict 82 of the fema flood zones f which measures overprediction is estimated as 0 17 demonstrating that 17 of the grid cells were falsely reported as flooded by the model the c equivalent to the f squared statistics a common metric to evaluate spatial extents for flood studies bates and de roo 2000 is estimated as 0 70 providing an overall measure of fit the c metric adds a penalty to h for any overprediction and underprediction in addition the fact that e for flood2d gpu is less than 1 0 93 suggests an overall tendency of the model to underpredict predominantly in the upstream reaches close to inflow boundary conditions these key metrics suggest that flood2d gpu performance is on a par with the acceptable range of these metrics provided in the literature alfieri et al 2014 wing et al 2017 for instance alfieri et al 2014 obtained h values between 0 59 and 0 78 and c values between 0 43 and 0 65 for a flood simulation at 100 m resolution across selected areas in germany and the united kingdom compared with national regional hazard maps wing et al 2017 performed a similar evaluation for validation of a flood hazard model for the conterminous us using fema flood zones as a benchmark with h values as 0 685 and 0 815 and c values of 0 55 and 0 50 for 90 m and 30 m spatial resolutions respectively the results indicate overall satisfactory performance of the flood2d gpu in comparing spatial extents for 1 in 100 year event against the equivalent flood inundation zone obtained from fema 3 2 ensemble pmf hydrographs and comparison with deterministic approach this section presents the ensemble pmf hydrographs for each of the four sets of moisture maximized storms i e cfsr ct ccsm4 bl ccsm4 f1 and ccsm4 f2 at the outlet of the etowah watershed fig 4 the hydrographs with the largest peak discharge are presented in thick lines in fig 4 and are individually presented in fig 5 a for further comparison the pmf hydrograph from the conventional approach hmr based is also presented for the etowah watershed fig 5a the range of peak discharge values for these events is presented in fig 5b for etowah watershed and at the outlets of computational flood2d domains me01 and me02 in fig 5c and d respectively the results indicate that peak discharges obtained for ccsm4 bl and hmr are comparable in magnitude with maximum peak discharge values of 21 874 m3 s and 18 654 m3 s respectively although the deterministic hmr peak discharge is less than the maximum event in each set of the hydrographs it is larger than more than 75 of the ensemble members and lies among the top quartile of all events in addition the hmr based deterministic peak discharge is 82 larger than the ensemble mean peak discharge of all ccsm4 bl members table 4 suggesting the relative magnitude of the deterministic hmr approach the maximum peak discharge for cfsr ct 27 732 m3 s is greater than for ccsm4 bl this higher discharge could be attributed to higher pmp estimates for cfsr ct demonstrating the effect of the choice of meteorological forcings on pmf gangrade et al 2018 the effects of climate change on maximum peak discharge indicate a significant increase in peak discharge magnitude with an increase of approximately 58 for the near future time period ccsm4 f1 2021 2050 and 109 for the far future period ccsm4 f2 2071 2100 the comparison is performed with reference to the peak discharge magnitude obtained for the baseline period ccsm4 bl these changes could be attributed to increased pmp estimates projected in the future periods resulting from the intensification of the hydrologic cycle caused by atmospheric warming readers are referred to rastogi et al 2017 and gangrade et al 2018 for further technical details the results demonstrate a large variability in the hydrograph shapes and peak discharge values figs 4 5b d in addition to the key factor e g pmp magnitude the variability in the hydrographs can be attributed to spatiotemporal rainfall structure and watershed heterogeneity the results also highlight the range of uncertainties captured in terms of streamflow estimates which are often missing in the conventional deterministic estimation of pmf here we mainly focus on the range of streamflow variability that corresponds to a set of moisture maximized storms similar concepts can also be followed to develop ensemble hydrographs that address other possible sources of uncertainties e g timing parameterization 3 3 development of probabilistic flood maps an ensemble based approach involves analyzing a collection of simulated flood events corresponding to multiple hydrographs and peak discharge magnitudes generally the most extreme or worst case scenario is selected by choosing the single pmf hydrograph with the maximum peak discharge in this section we analyze the effects of ensemble pmf in terms of flood inundation area by translating these hydrographs into probabilistic flood inundation maps and comparing the results with flood extents obtained via the conventional deterministic approach this comparison is intended to illustrate flood damages extents resulting from pmf events and associated uncertainties the pfms are presented for each of the 30 moisture maximized storms fig 6 panels a through d for me01 panels e through h for me02 and panels i through l for me02r the results are presented in term of conditional probability of flooding for a given cell assuming a moisture maximized storm has occurred in the region panels a and e also include the deterministic flood extents obtained from flood2d gpu driven by conventional hmr pmf presented as white contours overlaid on top of the probabilistic flood maps in addition the range of maximum flood inundation area associated with each storm event is presented in fig 7 for me01 panel a me02 under natural flow condition panel b and me02r under ideal reservoir regulation panel c a comparison of the maximum flood inundation extent for the domain upstream of allatoona lake and dam me01 fig 6a obtained by the conventional hmr based approach 15 56 km2 is very similar to the maximum flooding extent of cfsr ct me01 16 83 km2 and ccsm4 bl me01 16 32 km2 resulting in 8 2 and 4 9 respective increments in inundation area compared with hmr on the other hand the downstream domain me02 fig 6e has a larger difference in flood extent obtained from the hmr approach 96 6 km2 compared with the maximum flood extents of cfsr ct me02 117 9 km2 and ccsm4 bl me02 101 5 km2 the results are 22 1 and 5 1 respective increments in inundation area compared with hmr a comparison of panels 6e and 6i in fig 6 reveals the maximum possible flood reduction by the allatoona reservoir due to its regulation of pmf scale events in the immediate downstream areas ideal reservoir operation results in a decrease in the maximum flood inundation area of 9 5 in the cfsr ct case given the projected future climate conditions the simulated maximum inundation area reveals a likely increase in both near future ccsm4 f1 and far future ccsm4 f2 periods for me01 the projected maximum inundation areas are 17 6 km2 for ccsm4 f1 and 19 1 km2 for ccsm4 f2 which suggest 8 and 17 increases when compared with the 16 3 km2 ccsm4 bl m01 baseline value fig 7a similarly a total of 121 2 km2 108 7 km2 and 135 7 km2 128 4 km2 in the maximum inundation area is projected for me02 me02r for ccsm4 f1 and ccsm4 f2 and they suggest 19 22 and 34 44 increases when compared with the 101 5 km2 88 9 km2 ccsm4 bl me02 ccsm4 bl me02r baseline value the results indicate that the percentage increase in maximum inundation area is projected to be higher for me02r than for me02 mainly due to a smaller me02r baseline value given the wide range of areal extents produced for each set of moisture maximized storms further insight into flood characteristics e g flood inundation area gauge height using hydrologic meteorological parameters can improve the understanding of flood zones the relationship between peak discharge and maximum flood inundation area is presented in fig 8 although the maximum flood inundation area is highly correlated to the peak discharge at the outlet of each model the relationship is nonlinear with a higher variance observed for me02 fig 8b than for me01 fig 8a this finding was mainly attributed to the relatively flat topography in me02 the variability demonstrates that a similar peak discharge could result in varying extents of flood inundation which could be attributed to hydrograph characteristics including timing sequence and total flood volume and spatial variations in streamflow for instance two storms with maximum peak discharges of 11 112 m3 s and 11 504 m3 s respectively can produce maximum flood inundation areas of 102 1 km2 and 81 32 km2 for me02 fig 8b the results suggest that a single peak discharge value for pmf obtained using the conventional approach cannot capture such variations in flood impacts the results further highlight the value of an ensemble based approach compared with current deterministic methods for more comprehensive understanding of flood damage resulting from an extreme event 3 4 potential changes in flood impacts arising from pmf in this section we use the pfm to examine the potential changes in the flood regime and its impacts on infrastructure urban developments under projected future climate conditions to illustrate how the conditional probability of flooding due to moisture maximized storms changes in different periods the difference in probability of flooding at each grid among ccsm4 bl ccsm4 f1 and ccsm4 f2 for each domain me01 me02 and me02r was calculated and is summarized in fig 9 the grid cells that are consistently flooded i e probability 1 or non flooded i e probability 0 in all inundation maps across all storms ccsm4 bl ccsm4 f1 and ccsm4 f2 were excluded from the analysis the results indicate that the overall probability of flooding will increase by up to 30 in ccsm4 f1 across me01 me02 and me02r where most grid cells show increasing probability ranging between 0 and 0 15 similarly the histogram for ccsm4 f2 indicates that the overall probability of flooding will increase by up to 60 for ccsm4 f2 for each domain me01 me02 and me02r with most cells showing positive increases ranging between 0 and 0 25 this process allows the identification of other areas that may be more susceptible to pmf scale flooding in addition to the most vulnerable areas i e probability 1 to demonstrate the potential application of this framework the analysis was further expanded to demonstrate the utility of pfms as a tool to identify potential hazards to electricity grid infrastructure arising from pmf events the vulnerability of 16 selected electric substations from the homeland infrastructure foundation level data fig 1 for me02 was evaluated and additional ensemble information such as duration of flooding and median flood depths is presented in fig 10 these results identify the substations at risk of flooding given a pmf event has occurred of 16 substations 8 substations 6 7 9 10 12 13 14 and 15 demonstrated a high probability of flooding 0 75 for me02 under unregulated flow condition for ccsm4 bl the mean duration of flooding and median flood depths is likely to show an increase in ccsm4 f1 and ccsm4 f2 compared with ccsm4 bl similarly the substations currently not at risk of flooding in ccsm4 bl for instance 1 2 3 5 and 8 have a higher chance of flooding in future time periods i e ccsm4 f1 and ccsm4 f2 further additional information from the ensemble approach such as distribution of duration of flooding and median floods depths has the potential to reduce the likelihood of type i and type ii decision errors in risk management such risk identification research can help improve current flood mitigation features while also equipping decision makers with information that can be used in strategic planning and development of future urban areas and or critical infrastructure 3 5 sensitivity analysis to understand the overall and relative sensitivity of flood inundation to various factors such as meteorological forcings climate change hydraulic and hydrologic model inputs and parameters a comprehensive sensitivity test was performed as explained in table 5 the simulation results from scenarios s2 through s7 are compared with reference to the control scenario s1 in fig 11 the relative sensitivity reveals that climate change s3a and s3b and meteorological forcings s2a are the most sensitive factors for flood inundation area and the median flood depths for me02 climate change is likely to cause increases of up to 33 7 and 46 5 in inundated area and median flood depth respectively these differences in inundation areas for the aforementioned scenarios can be attributed mainly to changes in pmp values revealing that precipitation is the most sensitive factor affecting flood regimes reservoir operations s7 can also contribute moderately by reducing the overall flood inundation area by approximately 13 2 compared with s1 note that the reduction is calculated under an ideal reservoir operation scenario and will be directly controlled by the maximum storage capacity of the reservoir the other two sensitive parameters in this order include the effects of antecedent moisture conditions in the hydrologic model s6 and the effects of using a high resolution dem s4 they produce relative changes of 8 6 and 6 7 respectively for the inundation area the effect of the manning s roughness coefficient was found to be the least sensitive factor in this case a similar trend was also noticed for median flood depths it should be noted that a minimum depth threshold of 10 cm was utilized to calculate the maximum inundation area post hydrodynamic simulation we also repeated our analysis using a 1 cm threshold which lead to minimal impacts for our watershed however it can have a stronger influence in flat topographies or other regions 4 summary and conclusions this study demonstrates a high resolution process based hydro meteorological modeling framework to generate ensemble based pfms for two selected domains for the worst case flood scenarios i e pmf an ensemble of 120 moisture maximized pmp storms were acquired from rastogi et al 2017 for historical time period and future climate projections pmf estimates were then generated by driving dhsvm at a 90 m grid resolution the 3 hour hydrographs obtained from dhsvm for each storm were used to drive a 2d gpu accelerated hydraulic model flood2d gpu at 30 m and 10 m spatial resolutions to produce flood maps for each storm the probability of inundation was then calculated at each grid cell of the flood domain which was then used to generate pfms further the relative sensitivity of flood inundation area and median flood depth was evaluated for various factors such as meteorological forcings climate change antecedent moisture conditions and hydraulic model inputs and parameters the results indicate that the peak discharge from the pmf hydrograph is likely to increase significantly for the etowah watershed region under a changing climate the region downstream of allatoona lake is likely to observe an increase of up to 58 in peak discharge magnitude in the near future period 2021 2050 ccsm4 f1 and up to 109 in the far future period 2071 2100 ccsm4 f2 under rcp8 5 compared with the baseline period 1981 2010 ccsm4 ct these changes in pmf translate into approximately 19 and 33 increases in the flood inundation area an evaluation of probabilistic inundation maps revealed that the probability of flooding is likely to increase by up to 30 and 60 respectively under the near future and far future scenarios for the 16 selected electrical substations the vulnerability assessment suggests that over 50 of the selected substations have more than 75 probability of flooding during pmf events in the baseline period the probability of flooding increases significantly in the projected near and far future periods for far future scenario ccsm4 f2 all substations are projected to be inundated in at least one of the ensemble simulations additionally the high resolution outputs may also provide additional information such as duration of flooding and flood depths under these scenarios the relative sensitivity experiments further demonstrated that precipitation is the most sensitive factor affecting the flood regime including flood inundation areas and depth the choice of meteorological forcings can contribute to up to a 16 change in the flood inundation area further the flood inundation elasticity relationships developed between peak streamflow and corresponding flood inundation area revealed the uncertainties associated with the shape and timing of hydrographs originating from the spatiotemporal variability in precipitation and the watershed heterogeneity the proposed hydro meteorological modeling framework can enable the generation of probabilistic flood inundation maps through ensemble based pmp and pmf simulation the uncertainties associated with the most sensitive factor i e extreme precipitation and others can be successfully captured with an ensemble approach as presented in this study the comprehensive relative sensitivity analysis and its effects on flood regime further identify the most important factors causing changes to flood regimes although the study focused on a particular huc08 basin the framework can be extended to other regions to generate ensemble based probabilistic flood inundation maps these maps can serve as an important tool and provide ensemble based information regarding key flood characteristics including flood depth and duration to decision makers rather than deterministic values obtained from the conventional approach such an evaluation of a region not only determines the regions under flood risk but also informs stakeholders regarding the probability of inundation to enable informed decisions declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments sg and sck were supported by the hydro research foundation and us department of energy

6298,transient scour and fill refers to the general scour and fill in a riverbed due to flood passage it was given much attention in times of leopold and maddock 1953 and colby 1964 from records of outstanding case studies field data from a station in a contracted long reach of the large sand bed pilcomayo river 1192 newly typed in forms are presented with sediment concentration in the database up to 60 kg m3 mostly wash load water surface rises and falls during a flood event whereas streambed evolves in reverse it renders the analogy to an accordion streambed scouring accounts for 36 of the change in flow area during floods and data reveal scouring up to 4 m from the streambed elevation when flood starts velocity data display large hysteresis loops inexplicable by unsteady flow only once streambed starts to fall river bed scour is self sustaining water depth gradient appears to be a crucial variable in a novel equation for transient scour and fill derived from exner equation it turns out that flow non uniformity is relevant to explain transient scour and fill in contrast to flow unsteadiness which is not quasi steady gradually varied flow equation solved along the contracted reach is the base for a model that captures well the recorded bed evolution the model explains most of the transient scour and fill by the downstream expansion but the non uniform flow and the bed material suspended load also play a role the model fails on the days of highest sediment concentrations keywords transient scour sediment transport river morphology pilcomayo river 1 introduction general scour usually refers to the streambed elevation change in other words it is the scour and usually the corresponding fill that naturally occurs in a river bed irrespective of any man made structure melville and coleman 2000 long term general scour alias streambed degradation is a process through which a river can approach or recover equilibrium after a disturbance galay 1983 martín vide et al 2010 it usually develops along decades and should be distinguished from short term general scour associated with floods transient scour is used herein as a digest of the general scour and fill of the streambed during the passage of a flood strikingly such a paramount phenomenon in alluvial rivers transient scour with implications for river crossings and bridges is seldom highlighted in recent literature in the context of geomorphology describe transient fluctuations in streambeds of large rivers the most important based on ancient usgs gage measurements for instance the san juan colorado rio grande and east fork river in the united states lane and borland 1953 leopold and maddock 1953 leopold et al 1964 andrews 1979 the yellow river and others in china lane and borland 1953 wan and wang 1994 wang et al 2013 and the fraser river in canada hickin 1995 in the context of river engineering practice references are focused on design methods bettess 2002 lauchlan and may 2002 melville and coleman 2000 but they often lack a clear physical meaning of the process at hand some advances on bed adjustments due to width variations repetto et al 2002 wu et al 2011 do not address specifically the issue of transient scour and fill we suspect transient scour is paid little attention nowadays because past researches claimed the phenomenon had been incorrectly posed the empirical observations enabled leopold and maddock 1953 to stress the influence of sediment load on transient scour the observed changes in the stream bed resulted from changes in the sediment load brought into the reach from upstream their data were obtained in cross sections with approximately constant width in spite of large discharge variations lane and borland 1953 stated that transient scour does not occur universally i e in all extension of an alluvial river but it does in relatively narrow primarily straight segments of mildly sloping rivers customary characteristics of gauging stations indeed to the authors knowledge there are no examples of transient scour in wide sections or in steep beds the interpretation by leopold and maddock 1953 cited above was refuted by his discussers on the same lines from the very beginning colby 1964 complained about the lack of acknowledgement on the inherent stability of sand beds elevation and noted problems in interpreting observations of scour and fill the problems are a there are too few points to deduce an average position of the streambed at a cross section b not an average scour depth is observed but the maximum instantaneous scour depth because of the passage of bed forms and c the scour and fill in a stream reach cannot be determined from observations in one or few cross sections he used the principles of sediment continuity and bed material transport of sand to demonstrate that transient scour only exists in narrow cross sections in the end colby 1964 may have contributed to current understanding of transient scour and fill as a mere artefact at gauging stations the current understanding of dynamic equilibrium at a contraction needs to be related to transient scour width integrated sediment transport rate fed into a narrow reach equals the same rate transported out of the narrow reach through the wide reach downstream bolla pitaluga et al 2014 the argument for the role of narrow cross sections as the only possible mechanism producing transient scour and fill colby 1964 and thus considered as a minor particularity of streambeds may have concealed other contributing factors to transient scour such as the sediment load this paper reconsiders the topic of transient scour and fill with new data our data and those reported for the yellow river wang et al 2013 may delineate a separate topic of rapidly varying cross sections in large alluvial rivers with high suspended sediment load with a large share of wash load apart from new evidence of the phenomenon the objective is to investigate its causes more precisely in view of the state of the art the objective is to check if colby 1964 explains the phenomenon or otherwise rapidly varying cross sections require new explanations such as incorporating the sediment load following leopold and maddock 1953 the paper is divided in two parts empirical sections 2 5 where data and empirical analysis are presented and analytical sections 6 9 where new equations are sought for a physically based explanation that allows to build a predictive model 2 field site and methods the pilcomayo river flows south eastwards from the bolivian andes across the chaco plains setting the border between argentina and paraguay fig 1 a in a very flat landscape with an average slope of s0 0 03 the particular geomorphology of the pilcomayo has been handled elsewhere martín vide et al 2012 this paper shows field data from a gauging station of the river with a contributing area of 96 000 km2 the station is located in a 2500 m long fairly straight contracted reach bounded by artificial levees with a high discharge capacity before spilling fig 1d this channelized reach is stable in planform contrary to the very dynamic upstream and downstream wider reaches with rapid meander migration and collapse fig 1b during floods the average width for the contracted reach is b 160 m and for the wide reach is b 500 m the streambed is composed of fine sand median diameter d 50 0 2 mm sediment density ρs 2600 kg m3 and the prevailing mode of transport is suspension bedload transport is between 3 and 5 of the total sediment load transport amarilla and amsler 2005 the riverbed at the gauging station is rapidly changing since 1960 the work in this gauging station has consisted in measurements for river runoff computations with a daily frequency under normal conditions and twice a day when relevant hydrologic events occur the main goal is the production of data for a fair distribution of water between the two lowland countries argentina and paraguay the hydrological regime is quite regular a wet season from november to april with high discharges often exceeding the 1200 m3 s and a dry season from may to october with low discharges of around 5 m3 s the database consists of 1192 original handwritten forms available from the trinational commission for the development of the pilcomayo river basin http www pilcomayo net common data are flow velocities and discharge from velocity integration cross section geometries and elevations streambed and water surface there are 734 forms completed with suspended sediment concentrations c in kg m3 and the remaining 458 include water surface slopes ss between two stadia rods 310 m apart table 1 from a cableway system a propeller current meter measured flow velocity and water depth at equidistant verticals generally 10 m apart but sometimes 5 m apart so we can obtain an adequate representation of the streambed to avoid problems a too few points and b maximum scour previously mentioned by colby 1964 and defined above the six tenths method velocities are obtained at 0 6 of the depth from the water surface or the three point method velocities are recorded at 0 2 0 6 and 0 8 of the depth from the water surface are typically used to calculate mean velocities at each vertical although the float method is used in rough conditions e g great amount of debris from simultaneous data obtained with a propeller and a float a correction factor of 0 9 is applied to velocities acquired from a float to calculate mean flow velocities from the same cableway suspended sediment was sampled with a us d 49 depth integrating sampler of 1 8 in diameter nozzle samples were obtained at three verticals 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 of the width from the left bank bulk samples were taken from the river bank if the sampler was inoperative since 1993 suspended sediment samples have been sieved to obtain the percentage of fines 0 062 mm suspended sediment load in the pilcomayo river is one of the largest in the world with a yearly average transport of 140 106 tons mostly wash load from upland andes although the maximum concentration of sediment in suspension in the database is as high as 60 kg m3 it is far from hyperconcentrated conditions wan and wang 1994 the database comprises both wet and dry seasons as well as rising and falling limbs of hydrographs therefore it provides exhaustive at a station hydraulic geometry relationships of fine grained sand rivers with high suspended sediment concentration and is useful to illustrate the dynamics of rapidly changing cross sections above all it will be devoted here to investigate the dynamics of transient scour and fill 3 description of field data the dynamics of the channel cross section at the gauging station is better conveyed by an animation of the flow area development on a day to day basis online supplementary material ready for download at journal of hydrology discrete measured streambed points are connected to define a polygon i e channel cross section whose upper edge is the free water surface a fixed coordinate system and details on the time of the day of the measurements allow for a correct spatial temporal representation key frames from the animation are illustrated in fig 2 they represent the initial stage white an intermediate rising stage light grey and solid edge the peak stage dark grey an intermediate falling stage light grey and dashed line and the final stage black we include a boundary area 180 m wide and 10 m high which is the envelope for all the cross sections in the database the flow area moves within these boundaries expanding and shrinking initially water free surface rises and the streambed drops later this motion is present in reverse it is conceptualized with the name of transient scour and in addition renders the analogy to an accordion one hand pulling the free surface the other hand the bed thus the flood rise and fall are accompanied by scour and fill respectively however there are exceptions and the streambed rise and drop is also uneven in the cross section the deepening is not proportional to the initial depth and there is a change in the outline driving the centre of gravity with it and a shift in the thalweg at any rate scouring is mainly vertical and scarcely lateral the distortion in fig 2 must not be misleading the initial and final stages are similar in the same fashion as the two intermediate stages and no streambed degradation is observed at the end of the year however the transient scour in the annual flood with a peak on 31 january 1981 amounted to more than 3 m the five largest hydrologic events in terms of peak discharge q hereafter simply events from the fraction of the database with measured suspended sediment concentration c are selected for the analysis of transient scour fig 3 events 1 and 2 and events 4 and 5 are consecutive in the same high flow season of 1973 and 1991 respectively event 3 falls at the end of the low flow season of 1985 the combination of the free surface elevation h with either the thalweg η or the mean streambed elevation z distinctly depicts the accordion with an extent described by the evolution of the mean flow depth y h z the latter z is preferred because it is based upon the area of scour or fill between two consecutive cross section measurements defined as the net scoured area δaz fig 4 a remarkable feature in all events is a pattern of high c on the first days events 1 and 2 standing out among the others in particular c peaks two days in advance of the maximum q in event 2 and the stream rises at the same time as the maximum c 56 5 kg m3 is recorded at the beginning of event 1 both features resemble the main example in leopold and maddock 1953 because c is weakly correlated with q plots c q reveal clockwise and counterclockwise loops single valued and figure eight relations williams 1989 fan et al 2012 yang and lee 2018 the fall of η is smaller events 1 and 2 approximately the same event 4 or bigger events 3 and 5 η sinks nearly 4 m than the rise of h in general z drop is nearly the same or smaller than that of η therefore δz δη where δf is the variation between two consecutive measurements generally separated by 1 day of any variable f 4 empirical analysis of the amount of transient scour the purpose of this section is the correlation of the field data to infer the most advantageous lines of analysis the net scoured area δaz m2 0 for scour and 0 for fill and the concurrent change in flow area δa m2 are compared in fig 5 the two variables are selected because they are comparable quantities δaz is just a part of the δa and they rely solely on the field measured data the plot shows the share of the streambed scour fill δaz in the change of the flow area δa data located in the first third quadrant of fig 5 are consistent with what may be expected during the rising falling limb of the hydrograph if the transient scour analogy to an accordion is to be accepted there are some measurements in the second and fourth quadrants but the majority are located near the origin in the graph where both δa and δaz are small the identity line δaz δa line i still surface denotes an increase decrease in δa at the expense of an increase decrease of only δaz and therefore h stands still the x axis δaz 0 line ii rigid streambed describes a stationary streambed despite the increase decrease in δa that would occur at the expense of a rise fall of only h the data are predominantly in the sector delimited by both line i still surface and line ii rigid streambed the relationship δaz δa by simple linear regression line iii for data with q 350 m3 s is 1 δ a z 0 36 δ a only the regression coefficient is significant and the r squared is 0 75 on average the net scoured area accounts for the 36 of the change in flow area the two components of δaz the gross scour and the gross fill are represented by its envelope in fig 5 they reveal the unevenness in the cross section variations the bigger smaller δa is the closer to the fitting equation the gross scour fill gets in other words data scatter concentrates around low absolute values of δaz and δa if we dismiss data located in the second and fourth quadrants 24 of the data with q 350 m3 s from the analysis since they violate the accordion hypothesis the simple linear regression model results in δaz 0 39 δa and an r squared of 0 86 because a design hydrograph is usually an input to estimate general scour a simple linear regression of δaz against δq instead of δa would be more appealing as a predicting tool unfortunately such a regression lessens r squared to 0 59 as it involves flow characteristics of the alluvial channel i e whatever the relation δa δq or stage discharge relation is which are dealt with next furthermore a simple linear regression for the relationship δaz δ c q minimizes the r squared to 0 32 corroborating the weak correlation between q and c 5 brief analysis of field data in this section a basic analysis of resistance to flow hysteresis and sediment transport is provided the manning coefficient n s m1 3 worked as n v 1 rh 2 3 ss 1 2 where v is the mean flow velocity m s rh is the hydraulic radius m and ss is the surface slope is restrained between 0 011 and 0 025 with most data ranging from 0 014 to 0 021 fig 6 measured ss are restrained between 0 02 and 0 04 similar to bed slope s0 with a trend to have lower ss for higher q the relationship n q is modelled by simple linear regression for data with q 350 m3 s and at 95 confidence level the relationship n q is not significant for data with q 350 m3 s thus n 0 018 can be regarded as a constant however for the selected events n is computed with ss s0 0 03 and there is not a random scatter around the mean 0 018 fig 6 the lower threshold n 0 011 agrees with a grain roughness of 0 2 mm in the strickler formula n d 50 1 6 21 we may in principle attribute higher n values to bedforms and to the effect of high c in the context of high concentration c of fine sediment only small bedforms are expected best 2005 fredsoe and deigaard 1992 wan 1985 in addition julien 2002 predicts washed out dunes for n between 0 014 and 0 025 for c ranging from 1 to 4 kg m3 i e c one order of magnitude smaller than in the events in fig 3 in conclusion transient scour measured in the pilcomayo should not be linked to passing bedforms not only because field measurements are not maximum but average scour but because low n values do not warrant their presence field data reveal loop rating curves typically in the curve h q observed hysteresis is more pronounced in the plot v q especially in events 3 and 5 fig 7 a concomitant with a great transient scour the rising stage exhibits higher v than the falling stage thus generating a clockwise loop the plot c y fig 7b also displays clockwise loops with higher lower concentrations during rising falling limbs respectively then at a given q there is a decrease of c concomitant with a decrease in v and an increase in y although it does not necessarily imply a cause effect relation this statement agrees with leopold and maddock 1953 if a constant width b is assumed the significance of the variation of b with time is studied in following sections regarding sediment transport amarilla and amsler 2005 determined that the engelund and hansen 1967 equation eh is satisfactory to characterize the bed material transport of the pilcomayo by comparing the outcome from several equations with 10 years of data the sediment load was separated into sand 0 062 mm and 11 of the total load in average and fine sediment 0 062 mm and 89 of the total load in average sand was assigned to bed material load and fine sediment to wash load engelund hansen equation reads qt k v 2 τ 3 2 where qt is unit bed material transport v is velocity τ is shear stress and k is the constant 0 05 g 2 ρ 3 2 r 2 d 50 1 where g 9 81 m s2 ρ is water density r is ρ s ρ ρ with ρ s sediment density and d 50 is median grain size 6 analytical approach mass conservation after new evidence on transient scour and fill the analytical research on its causes starts we extend the empirical equation 1 obtained from daily measurements to a continuous change in time by replacing da b dy and daz bz dz to obtain 2 dz dt 0 36 b b z dy dt where b is the surface width and bz is the width of the streambed affected by two consecutive measurements fig 4 note that the negative sign in 2 indicates that bed scouring dz dt 0 occurs when water depth increases accordion analogy eq 2 is site specific because b bz depends on the cross section shape and the coefficient 0 36 is only valid for this site as such it should replicate the streambed evolution of the river the imperfect fitting of eq 2 for b bz 1 see fig 8 later on announces the difficulty of scour and fill prediction in the selected events indeed the large scatter for q 350 m3 s in fig 5 anticipates the disagreement in fig 8 for events 3 4 and 5 the bed scours more than the replicated then a ratio b bz higher than 1 could slightly improve the results the fitting is especially poor in the first days of events 1 and 2 and to a lesser extent first days of event 5 where channel bed aggrades contrary to the replicated an equation akin to 2 seems the ideal predicting tool yet with the coefficient varying with the relevant variables instead of being a site specific constant i e 0 36 for the pilcomayo the differential equation of sediment mass conservation is used to obtain 3 details on its derivation and the proof that the wash load does not change the streambed elevation are given in appendix a eq 3 is written as per unit width to be applied to the narrow reach of uniform width while the wide channel downstream will set its boundary condition for a general cross section see appendix a it reads 3 z t 1 λ t α c y q t x q t x where qt is the bed material transport bedload and suspended load excluding wash load α the fraction of bed material in the total depth averaged volumetric suspended sediment concentration c α 0 11 after amarilla and amsler 2005 see section 5 and λ a constant bed porosity assumed 0 4 with measured data qt α c v y unfortunately for the ideal equation the local term time variation of the right hand side of 3 only amounts to 0 2 of the total variation with our data far from the 36 on average according to 1 cui et al 2005 also argue against the importance of the local term therefore the spatial term convective derivative on the right hand side of 3 is dominant in explaining how bed elevation changes in time to sum up the depth variation at the gauging station y t seems not to be a good indicator of the capacity of a flood to scour the bed contrary to 2 when the mass conservation in differential form is used the counter example of an increasing depth in stagnant water is telling to reject an equation akin to 2 7 spatial variation versus unsteadiness the role of the spatial variation in the transient scour can be further investigated with simple differential analysis first the bed material transport qt in 3 can be equalled to a sediment transport capacity equation the eh formula that suits to the pilcomayo as stated above is chosen by using the manning equation and the water mass conservation equation y t q x 0 the spatial derivative of eh results 4 q t x 5 q t q y t 1 1 v y x other monomial sediment transport formulas and resistance equations produce similar derivatives e g the coefficient 5 would be 3 with the meyer peter and müller bed load equation and the coefficient 1 1 would be 1 with the chézy equation more importantly the local term in eq 4 is again much smaller in absolute value than the spatial term and thus it can be neglected we can estimate an average v 2 3 m s for the selected events in our database while y x 0 01 so that the term 1 1 v y x amounts to 22 m day much larger than y t the maximum is 4 m day therefore the exner equation is expressed as 5 z t 1 λ 5 5 q t q v y x eq 5 retains the dominant component in transient scour discarding the two minor local terms t in 3 and 4 and can be adapted to other mild rivers by varying sediment transport capacity and resistance formulas that lead to coefficient 5 5 ultimately non uniformity represented by the crucial spatial derivative y x unlike flow unsteadiness appears relevant to the transient scour the differential analysis can be further useful appendix b proves that the unsteady flow term is not able to explain the amount of transient scour that occurs simultaneously within a flood hydrograph therefore there must be other triggering processes of the scour let us try to provide a physical explanation of transient scour based on the hysteretic behaviour registered in the stream gauge fig 7 note in this regards that as pointed out in appendix b y x is precisely the term that accounts for the extent of the loops observed in fig 7 henderson 1966 to this purpose the analysis of the loop rating curves yq or vq curves is revealing real data plotted in these curves exhibit a large magnification of v and y x which control transient scour through eq 5 with respect to the analytical solution of the unsteady flow over a fixed bed as said before this suggests a triggering factor other than flow unsteadiness responsible for these large magnifications and large transient scour one concurrent factor is the large suspended loads exhibiting hysteresis loops as well fig 7b but another factor is the channel width change between the gauging station and the wider regions upstream and downstream the analysis of the second factor is what follows next 8 the role of the two channel widths the gauging station is located in a long contracted reach b 160 m bounded upstream and downstream by two wider reaches b 500 m straub 1935 and laursen 1958 as reported by vanoni 1975 and raudkivi 1990 studied long term equilibrium scour in a long transition under constant discharge under such steady flow width integrated sediment transport through the channel width b should be constant i e b qt x 0 the authors found that the semi empirical expression b y k constant where k is a function of the excess of shear stress with respect to the critical one is the long term steady solution that allows uniform flow to exist in both the contracted reach its normal depth called ynb and the wide reaches normal depth ynb note that since the exponent k is 1 the scoured bed area is less than the flow area lost by the contraction based on their solution the formula for the long term scour at the contracted reach is 6 δ z b b 1 k 1 y nb where δz means the difference of bed elevation between reaches eq 6 can be extended to a continuum time by assuming constant widths and non changing bed elevation in the wide reach 7 dz dt b b 1 k 1 d y nb dt to some extent eq 7 is a reach specific equation since it encompasses long distances it resembles the site specific equation 2 in the sense that the transient scour is related to temporal changes of one water depth namely the normal depth at the wide reach eq 7 with k 1 5 valid for high sediment transport vanoni 1975 is applied by computing the normal depth ynb for each daily discharge for the selected events the results together with those of eq 2 are plotted in fig 8 note that eq 7 yields predictions closer to the data although similar to eq 2 the fitting is still poor in the first days of events 1 and 2 it may be surprising that the reach specific equation 7 replicates the transient scour as well as the site specific relation the latter despite being obtained by regression of a large amount of data indeed this reach specific equation is a semi empirical formula for long term scour under steady flow which does not involve any variable of the gauging station but only the regional characteristics b b and ynb the reader may even feel that the simple equation 7 supersedes real data indeed it is understandable to question both the need of field measurements and the complexities of exner and flow equations appendices a and b what are they for contrary to what has been concluded in 6 it should be noted that time variation of one water depth ynb t does seem to be a good indicator of the capacity of a flood for scouring furthermore from fig 8 we can infer that width changes seem to trigger transient scour and that one day seems a long term regarding transient scour next section tries to reconcile the semi empiricism of eq 7 with flow and exner equations regarding the time variation of the width at the gauging station itself the coefficient 5 5 in eq 5 should be replaced by 5 5 m where 0 m 1 appendix a fig 7c shows the quotient b y as function of discharge q for two events the higher q the smaller b y i e the increase in b is smaller than the rise of y when q grows data loop because b is larger during the rising than during the falling limb for the same q and y 9 a physically based explanation once flow unsteadiness is proved negligible section 7 an explanation on the grounds of the quasi steady gradually varied flow equations on an erodible bed in the contracted reach with a boundary condition at the expanded reach downstream is tested the reach is assumed prismatic i e all cross sections downstream are equal to the one at the gauging station all time there is no alternative for this bold assumption since the field work and bed survey was limited as customarily to one gauging station appendix c explains the rationale of this physically based model it is concluded that scour is expected during the rising limb a drawdown profile occurs but fill during the falling limb a backwater profile if discharge remains constant channel bed is bound to approach an equilibrium condition in which the difference in bed elevations between the contracted and the wide reaches equals the difference in uniform flow depths between them because uniform flow occurs throughout this is the assumption supporting eqs 6 and 7 in this sense the physically based model should tend asymptotically to eq 7 under a constant discharge how much time the model needs to do so is the last issue to reconcile appendix d provides a demonstration that eq 6 can be derived from steady gradually varied flow so that 7 express the spatial flow variation the main cause of transient scour in another way thus 6 is semi theoretical rather than semi empirical and the good performance of 7 to replicate real data becomes more comprehensible the approximate eq 3 and the analytical solution of the gradually varied flow by the bresse function henderson 1966 are preferred in the physically based model the tabulated bresse function retains the essence of the spatial variation in a wide prismatic channel while avoiding numerical models too skilled for such a simplified hypothetical geometry once a flow solver the bresse function is included in the model bed elevation changes at the gauging station are calculated by using the integral approach of eq 3 this approach does not lose resolution nor accuracy with respect to the differential approach and has the advantage of highlighting the reach length that experiences transient scour and thus it indirectly involves a morphodynamic time scale eq 3 is integrated with respect to space x and time t in a control volume of length l within the prismatic narrow reach l 2000 m and then extended to the elapsed time between two measurements δt 8 δ z l 1 λ t t δ t q t t l q t t 0 d t 0 where qt t 0 and qt t l are the bed material transport at the gauging station x 0 and at a distance x l downstream in the narrow reach respectively the control volume length l not known in principle must be commensurate with the distance travelled by the bed wave generating transient scour during the integration time δt 1 day note that the ratio l δt is the celerity of the bed wave or contains the inverse of the morphodynamic time scale as data are only available at x 0 m the time integral in eq 8 is rewritten as 9 t t δ t q t t l q t t 0 d t β 1 t t δ t q t t 0 d t where β encompasses the gradually varied flow within distance l and is defined as the ratio between bed material transport capacities at x l m and x 0 m it is derived from the tabulated bresse function the trapezoidal rule is applied to the time integral of qt and finally eq 9 is substituted into eq 8 to obtain 10 δ z 1 λ δ t l β 1 q t t 0 q t t δ t 0 2 11 β 1 2 q t t l q t t 0 q t t δ t l q t t δ t 0 where β has been averaged between two measurements one day apart δt 1 the solution of eq 10 is implicit and spatial derivatives are fully avoided except for β and the length l controlling the speed of the bed wave all other quantities in eq 10 are variables present in the database only to be consistent with the bresse function solver the eh formula is used in eq 11 for both qt l and qt 0 at any time the parameter β is a function of l and the differences in bed elevations δz and normal depths δyn between the contracted and wide reaches in addition total energy losses are neglected between the narrow and the wide sections at the outlet of the contracted reach for successive steps δyn changes according to q so the comparison between δz and δyn induces a drawdown β 1 the flow accelerates or a backwater β 1 the flow slows down see appendix c the streambed change δz is assumed completed at each δt and thus a volume δz l is scoured or filled and δz is updated every δt eq 10 is a robust convergence model for the database as it converges to an equilibrium scour for a constant q δz at the beginning of the computation day 1 is obtained by using eq 10 with the event s first day q but extended for a long time i e long term scour 10 results and discussion of scour and fill the integration length l is selected after a sensitivity analysis fig 9 shows the evolution of z for event 3 modelled with eq 10 with measured qt and α 0 11 see section 6 and a range of l between 50 m and 1950 m 2000 m separating the gauging station from the downstream transition note that the smaller the l the less dynamic the transient scour and vice versa modelled z for all selected events is obtained from eq 10 with l 1950 m in three ways shown in fig 10 if measured data are used qt is computed with α 0 11 and α 0 33 and is called replication if no measured data are used the eh formula is used to obtain qt and is called prediction the increase in bed material load in the measured suspension load by using α 0 33 instead of the average α 0 11 means that part of the assumed wash load is no longer wash load but interacts with the bed and thus enhances the dynamics of scour and fill discussion of the reach and site specific fig 8 and physically based model fig 10 follows 1 the physically based model traces fairly well the streambed evolution capturing the order of magnitude and the sign i e the analogy to an accordion of the transient scour and fill however modelled scour is smaller than measured in events 4 and 5 slightly smaller in event 3 and sometimes larger in events 1 and 2 although this may be deemed a poor performance for a model a number of assumptions and simplifications e g flow prismatic geometry and control volume led to eq 10 2 bed evolution is more dynamic for α 0 33 than in the other cases it gets closer to the measured data in events 3 4 and 5 yet farther in events 1 and 2 it follows that the definition of wash load based upon the separation of sand and finer sediment at size 0 062 mm may not be satisfactory for the phenomena of transient scour and fill obviously parameter α provides a means of tuning the model results which would be arbitrary without a deeper knowledge of the physics of suspended sediment transport 3 both prediction and replication results have the same relative success the choice of an appropriate sediment transport formula eh in this research may be credited for this success 4 differences between sediment supply and transport at capacity conditions do not explain the disagreement between model results and data instead they are the cause of the little difference between replication and prediction although the so called non equilibrium conditions supply capacity entail scour and fill the observed shortage of sediment load in event 5 makes little difference in the results see fig a1c 5 results from eqs 2 and 7 are very similar fig 8 although the latter exaggerates the scour displayed by the former especially in event 3 again scour is smaller than data in events 4 and 5 and the performance is poor in events 1 and 2 overall eq 7 is not worse than eq 2 as a replication of the streambed data 6 the discrepancy between eqs 2 and 7 in event 3 and not as much in other events may be attributed to their dates 1973 1985 and 1991 the pilcomayo is changing over time martín vide et al 2012 planform changes in downstream reaches modify the stage discharge relationship that affects ynb moreover ynb is not allowed to change over time in the model if the wide region downstream aggrades while the contracted region scours backwater is promoted in the contracted reach and thus a more rapid recovery from scour event 5 on the contrary clearly displays how the model is struggling to recover from scour 7 the success of eq 7 in replicating field data highlights the change in width from b to b as the main cause and triggering factor of the transient scour and fill the widening downstream explains most of the transient scour and fill within the contracted reach at low flow the two channel widths are probably similar but as the flow rises they may start to differ and thus to trigger bed scouring this point fully supports the assertion by colby 1964 8 eqs 2 and 7 fail when c is maximum first days of events 1 and 2 and when c peaks in advance of the maximum q event 2 and to a certain extent the first days of event 5 because they produce large scours whereas the actual bed slightly fills or scours the physically based model improves results and so it is postulated that large sediment loads are another cause of transient scour and fill superimposed on the expansion downstream this second cause is in accordance with leopold and maddock 1953 as quoted in the introduction examples of the yellow river in the hyperconcentrated flow domain wan and wang 1994 show large bed fills under huge sediment loads in an almost chaotic way sediment loads in the pilcomayo although much lower than those in the yellow river may be on the verge of a similar behaviour in events 1 and 2 different from current understanding of scour and fill according to colby 1964 9 as well as the good performance of 7 the ability of the system to approach rapidly any scour or fill stage was also striking one day is a long enough time for the bed to adjust to changes in flow this suggests that the morphodynamic time scale of bed change is similar to the time scale at which the flow is changing figs 9 and 10 prove that the contracted reach length is commensurate with the distance travelled by the bed wave of the transient scour and fill in one day the celerity of such a scour or fill wave of a magnitude of meters is then about 2 km day this figure is similar to 3 6 km day obtained from the approximation of the celerity of a bed disturbance in the differential analysis of the flow equations with exner under all the assumptions of shallow water flow de vries 1975 garde and ranga raju 1985 for the selected events it is computed as a v q t q 1 λ 1 fr 2 where a 5 is the exponent in the eh function q t v a fr 0 3 is the froude number q t q 0 02 and v 2 3 m s 10 the results of the physically based model and eq 7 are comparable apart from events 1 and 2 where the model performs better this is discouraging because flow profile sediment transport and time included in the physically based model are not necessary to predict transient scour and fill actually the expansion from b to b appears to override all other factors the similarities between these results not only confirm the support to colby 1964 but also mean that the expansion is necessarily acting through the intermediate mechanisms of flow profile sediment transport and time 11 conclusions new field data showcasing rapidly varying cross sections in a long contracted sand bed reach from a gauging station draining 96 000 km2 in the pilcomayo river is presented the maximum recorded suspended sediment load and streambed scour in one day are 60 kg m3 and 4 m respectively the objective is to check whether the often narrow gauging stations explain the transient scour and fill as asserted by colby 1964 reinforced by vanoni 1975 and currently understood or the changes in sediment supply are the cause of the observed scour and fill as asserted by leopold and maddock 1953 exner equation elaborating on its convective term leads to eq 5 for transient scour and fill which can be generalized to other rivers water depth gradients y x during a flood are crucial in the phenomenon indeed large differences in y x between the rising and falling limb are observed in the data thus displaying large hysteresis loops on the contrary the analytical solution in unsteady flow produces a negligible transient scour yet having the correct sign then the unsteadiness cannot explain the transient scour in spite of occurring simultaneously once river bed starts to fall scouring is self sustaining in the sense that the change in y x and the scour or fill explain each other by the flow equations the remaining question is the triggering factor that starts either the scour or the increase in y x incidentally suspended sediment concentration data loop simultaneously with flow variables as described by leopold and maddock 1953 however this does not imply a cause effect relation in fact the self sustaining scour does not need suspended sediment load in the explanation the quasi steady gradually varied flow in a long contraction with a boundary condition downstream coupled with the sediment mass conservation in a control volume leads to eq 10 this model is consistent with the equilibrium scour in long transitions the increase decrease in discharge determines a drawdown backwater profile which in turn determines bed elevation changes i e scour fill the term β 1 multiplied by the total bed material load has a different sign for drawdown and backwater conditions and is null in uniform flow conditions non uniformity not pure unsteadiness is relevant to transient scour the results prove that the expansion downstream of the long contracted reach explains most of the transient scour and fill through non uniform flow and bed material suspended load however as this fails on days of highest concentrations 40 kg m3 when the physically based model results are better it is postulated that large sediment loads are another cause of transient scour and fill superimposed on the expansion downstream it should be noted that equilibrium scour in long transitions eq 7 fully supports colby 1964 lastly leopold and maddock 1953 raised coincidental observations to causal statements although their observations are confirmed by our new data we adhere to the refutation by colby 1964 with new arguments narrow sites cause transient scour even in long transitions such as in the pilcomayo this is intimately connected with flow and sediment transport as eq 10 accounts for unlike eq 7 the large sediment load as another cause of transient scour and fill is not a vindication of the main contents of leopold and maddock 1953 this postulate cannot be more precise at this point except for a it does not have to do with the non equilibrium conditions supply capacity and b it does not have to do with the total suspended load partitioned between wash load not interacting with the bed and bed

hysteresis i e discharge q is not a unique function of y but also among other terms of y x in a diffusive wave for example the ratio of the actual q to the uniform flow discharge equals to 1 s0 1 y x 1 2 henderson 1966 this function of y x represents the extent of the loop in our data the hysteresis fig 7a and the transient scour fig 3 are concomitant and a large hysteresis comes with a large transient scour are therefore hysteresis and transient scour linked by a cause and effect relationship the mass and momentum equations in unsteady shallow water flow are a14 the diffusive wave jain 2001 is an approximation that only keeps those terms under the grey dashed lines of a14 the routing of the flood in a diffusive wave follows a diffusion equation the equation needs an initial wave at the upstream end if the initial wave is a sine curve an analytical solution of the diffusive wave is a15 y x t y 0 m 2 m 2 exp d t 2 π l 2 cos 2 π l x c t where y0 is the depth at the start of the wave and initial time x 0 t 0 m m is the base to peak amplitude at t 0 i e the growth in depth of the wave from the base and l m is the wavelength the wave celerity c and the diffusion coefficient d are assumed constant and defined at t 0 by averaging within one wavelength as c 5 3 v assuming manning coefficient is constant and d 3 c y 10 s f the bed slope s0 0 03 is constant and the friction slope is s f s 0 y x according to a a14 the analytical routing of this flood wave over a potentially infinite fixed bed shows a decaying wave amplitude in space and time fig a1 contrasts this analytical solution with the values in the database events 2 and 5 are selected because they resemble the sine wave fig a1a the hysteresis is extremely narrow in the analytical solution but very broad in the data v q clockwise in fig a1e and anticlockwise y q in fig a1d thus in the analytical solution y x hardly changes between the rising and falling limb whereas the change in the actual data y x is very big in other words the actual gradients y x are much exaggerated with respect to the analytical ones almost imperceptible similarly for the actual velocities v foreseeably the change in streambed elevation computed with eq 5 after introducing the analytical results of y x therein is only 1 of the scour in the database fig a1b in which the analytical transient scour is multiplied by 70 in the end apart from the correct sign the flow unsteadiness explains very little 1 of the transient scour z t because the change in gradient y x is almost negligible numerical experiments with saint venant and exner equations using a bed load predictor over a plane erodible bed express similar conclusions concerning the negligibility of transient scour due to unsteady flow medina and bateman 2010 finally qt computed with the eh formula for the analytical wave is compared with the actual bed material load from the database assuming the ratio of bed material transport to total sediment transport is constant α 0 11 fig a1c on event 2 the actual sediment transport is markedly larger than the computed one in the rising limb but the difference vanishes in the falling limb on event 5 the trend is alike for the first days yet with a large actual shortage around the peak sediment supply and transport capacity eh are not equal appendix c gradually varied flow and transient scour let us consider eq a14 with the local terms neglected therein only those terms above black dotted lines are kept the actual flow is well portrayed by subsequent steady stages of constant q i e a quasi steady flow the dynamic equation then stands for the gradually varied flow in the form of backwater m1 and drawdown m2 surface profiles in subcritical flow a boundary condition downstream applies the 2500 m long contracted reach assumed prismatic with the gauging station in it is a long transition because the flow is controlled by friction and slope apart from the downstream depth control moreover since all changes either scour or fill take part of this prismatic geometry it follows that river bed is assumed straight and parallel to the initial bed throughout the contracted reach a single bed slope s0 thus occurs in space and time first a rigid bed is considered and the downstream condition is the normal depth in the wide b region ynb water depth in the contracted reach width b will approach its own normal depth ynb asymptotically in the upstream direction since b b the difference between normal depths δyn ynb ynb is δyn 0 at any q δ stands for a spatial difference also at different daily stages of q separated by δq δ stands for 1 day difference changes in normal depths verify δynb δynb simply because b b again the two surface profiles m1 and m2 allow for an initial difference δz in the streambed elevation between wide and contracted reaches the sign δz 0 means the narrow is lower fig a2 a drawdown occurs if δz δyn and a backwater if δz δyn in case of drawdown flow accelerates v x 0 leading to an increase in bed shear stress τ x 0 and therefore in sediment transport capacity qt x 0 the situation is reverse in case of backwater according to exner see eq a8 channel bed scours in case of a drawdown curve z t 0 whereas it is filled in case a backwater curve z t 0 occurs the erodible bed behaviour can be approached on the same lines whenever the surface profile prevails as a drawdown curve in a stage of q river bed in the contracted reach will be scoured so the difference δz increases and approaches δy n the opposite response occurs when a backwater curve prevails channel bed will be filled decreasing δz to approach δyn then the quasi steady flow is approached similarly the drawdown curve is bound to prevail if discharge rises δq 0 because δyn increases i e δynb δynb conversely the backwater curve is bound to prevail if discharge falls δq 0 because δyn decreases i e δynb δynb to sum up scour and fill are expected during the rising and falling limbs respectively so the analogy to an accordion is depicted if δq 0 river bed is bound to approach an equilibrium condition with δz δyn and uniform flow prevails throughout the flow depth is ynb in the narrow reach and ynb in the wide in the quasi steady approach of daily changes δq actual velocities are higher than uniform velocities and y x s0 in case of a drawdown curve which occurs if δq 0 if the water surface profile is a backwater curve occurring when δq 0 the situation is reverse i e actual velocities are lower than uniform velocities and y x s0 this property is intrinsic of gradually varied flow thus depending on whether δz is bigger or smaller than δyn the scour or fill produces a change in y x and v so that it feeds itself back into the transient scour which according to eq 5 is proportional to the product v y x in other words the transient scour is self sustaining i e the exaggeration of v and y x observed in the real hysteresis loops can be explained by transient scour itself and vice versa in a sort of feedback appendix d derivation of vanoni equation from gradually varied flow it is well known that the gradually varied flow equation a14 above black dots can also be obtained by the derivation of the bernoulli equation i e by developing the following derivative d d x z y v 2 2 g s f to reconcile the semi empirical eq 7 with the gradually varied flow consider the application of the bernoulli equation to a finite distance l between the narrow and the wide regions fig a3 a16 z y v 2 2 g z y v 2 2 g s f l assume sf s0 throughout

be derived from the same principle used in the physically based model and the model is consistent with eq 7 appendix e supplementary material supplementary data to this article can be found online at

6298,transient scour and fill refers to the general scour and fill in a riverbed due to flood passage it was given much attention in times of leopold and maddock 1953 and colby 1964 from records of outstanding case studies field data from a station in a contracted long reach of the large sand bed pilcomayo river 1192 newly typed in forms are presented with sediment concentration in the database up to 60 kg m3 mostly wash load water surface rises and falls during a flood event whereas streambed evolves in reverse it renders the analogy to an accordion streambed scouring accounts for 36 of the change in flow area during floods and data reveal scouring up to 4 m from the streambed elevation when flood starts velocity data display large hysteresis loops inexplicable by unsteady flow only once streambed starts to fall river bed scour is self sustaining water depth gradient appears to be a crucial variable in a novel equation for transient scour and fill derived from exner equation it turns out that flow non uniformity is relevant to explain transient scour and fill in contrast to flow unsteadiness which is not quasi steady gradually varied flow equation solved along the contracted reach is the base for a model that captures well the recorded bed evolution the model explains most of the transient scour and fill by the downstream expansion but the non uniform flow and the bed material suspended load also play a role the model fails on the days of highest sediment concentrations keywords transient scour sediment transport river morphology pilcomayo river 1 introduction general scour usually refers to the streambed elevation change in other words it is the scour and usually the corresponding fill that naturally occurs in a river bed irrespective of any man made structure melville and coleman 2000 long term general scour alias streambed degradation is a process through which a river can approach or recover equilibrium after a disturbance galay 1983 martín vide et al 2010 it usually develops along decades and should be distinguished from short term general scour associated with floods transient scour is used herein as a digest of the general scour and fill of the streambed during the passage of a flood strikingly such a paramount phenomenon in alluvial rivers transient scour with implications for river crossings and bridges is seldom highlighted in recent literature in the context of geomorphology describe transient fluctuations in streambeds of large rivers the most important based on ancient usgs gage measurements for instance the san juan colorado rio grande and east fork river in the united states lane and borland 1953 leopold and maddock 1953 leopold et al 1964 andrews 1979 the yellow river and others in china lane and borland 1953 wan and wang 1994 wang et al 2013 and the fraser river in canada hickin 1995 in the context of river engineering practice references are focused on design methods bettess 2002 lauchlan and may 2002 melville and coleman 2000 but they often lack a clear physical meaning of the process at hand some advances on bed adjustments due to width variations repetto et al 2002 wu et al 2011 do not address specifically the issue of transient scour and fill we suspect transient scour is paid little attention nowadays because past researches claimed the phenomenon had been incorrectly posed the empirical observations enabled leopold and maddock 1953 to stress the influence of sediment load on transient scour the observed changes in the stream bed resulted from changes in the sediment load brought into the reach from upstream their data were obtained in cross sections with approximately constant width in spite of large discharge variations lane and borland 1953 stated that transient scour does not occur universally i e in all extension of an alluvial river but it does in relatively narrow primarily straight segments of mildly sloping rivers customary characteristics of gauging stations indeed to the authors knowledge there are no examples of transient scour in wide sections or in steep beds the interpretation by leopold and maddock 1953 cited above was refuted by his discussers on the same lines from the very beginning colby 1964 complained about the lack of acknowledgement on the inherent stability of sand beds elevation and noted problems in interpreting observations of scour and fill the problems are a there are too few points to deduce an average position of the streambed at a cross section b not an average scour depth is observed but the maximum instantaneous scour depth because of the passage of bed forms and c the scour and fill in a stream reach cannot be determined from observations in one or few cross sections he used the principles of sediment continuity and bed material transport of sand to demonstrate that transient scour only exists in narrow cross sections in the end colby 1964 may have contributed to current understanding of transient scour and fill as a mere artefact at gauging stations the current understanding of dynamic equilibrium at a contraction needs to be related to transient scour width integrated sediment transport rate fed into a narrow reach equals the same rate transported out of the narrow reach through the wide reach downstream bolla pitaluga et al 2014 the argument for the role of narrow cross sections as the only possible mechanism producing transient scour and fill colby 1964 and thus considered as a minor particularity of streambeds may have concealed other contributing factors to transient scour such as the sediment load this paper reconsiders the topic of transient scour and fill with new data our data and those reported for the yellow river wang et al 2013 may delineate a separate topic of rapidly varying cross sections in large alluvial rivers with high suspended sediment load with a large share of wash load apart from new evidence of the phenomenon the objective is to investigate its causes more precisely in view of the state of the art the objective is to check if colby 1964 explains the phenomenon or otherwise rapidly varying cross sections require new explanations such as incorporating the sediment load following leopold and maddock 1953 the paper is divided in two parts empirical sections 2 5 where data and empirical analysis are presented and analytical sections 6 9 where new equations are sought for a physically based explanation that allows to build a predictive model 2 field site and methods the pilcomayo river flows south eastwards from the bolivian andes across the chaco plains setting the border between argentina and paraguay fig 1 a in a very flat landscape with an average slope of s0 0 03 the particular geomorphology of the pilcomayo has been handled elsewhere martín vide et al 2012 this paper shows field data from a gauging station of the river with a contributing area of 96 000 km2 the station is located in a 2500 m long fairly straight contracted reach bounded by artificial levees with a high discharge capacity before spilling fig 1d this channelized reach is stable in planform contrary to the very dynamic upstream and downstream wider reaches with rapid meander migration and collapse fig 1b during floods the average width for the contracted reach is b 160 m and for the wide reach is b 500 m the streambed is composed of fine sand median diameter d 50 0 2 mm sediment density ρs 2600 kg m3 and the prevailing mode of transport is suspension bedload transport is between 3 and 5 of the total sediment load transport amarilla and amsler 2005 the riverbed at the gauging station is rapidly changing since 1960 the work in this gauging station has consisted in measurements for river runoff computations with a daily frequency under normal conditions and twice a day when relevant hydrologic events occur the main goal is the production of data for a fair distribution of water between the two lowland countries argentina and paraguay the hydrological regime is quite regular a wet season from november to april with high discharges often exceeding the 1200 m3 s and a dry season from may to october with low discharges of around 5 m3 s the database consists of 1192 original handwritten forms available from the trinational commission for the development of the pilcomayo river basin http www pilcomayo net common data are flow velocities and discharge from velocity integration cross section geometries and elevations streambed and water surface there are 734 forms completed with suspended sediment concentrations c in kg m3 and the remaining 458 include water surface slopes ss between two stadia rods 310 m apart table 1 from a cableway system a propeller current meter measured flow velocity and water depth at equidistant verticals generally 10 m apart but sometimes 5 m apart so we can obtain an adequate representation of the streambed to avoid problems a too few points and b maximum scour previously mentioned by colby 1964 and defined above the six tenths method velocities are obtained at 0 6 of the depth from the water surface or the three point method velocities are recorded at 0 2 0 6 and 0 8 of the depth from the water surface are typically used to calculate mean velocities at each vertical although the float method is used in rough conditions e g great amount of debris from simultaneous data obtained with a propeller and a float a correction factor of 0 9 is applied to velocities acquired from a float to calculate mean flow velocities from the same cableway suspended sediment was sampled with a us d 49 depth integrating sampler of 1 8 in diameter nozzle samples were obtained at three verticals 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 of the width from the left bank bulk samples were taken from the river bank if the sampler was inoperative since 1993 suspended sediment samples have been sieved to obtain the percentage of fines 0 062 mm suspended sediment load in the pilcomayo river is one of the largest in the world with a yearly average transport of 140 106 tons mostly wash load from upland andes although the maximum concentration of sediment in suspension in the database is as high as 60 kg m3 it is far from hyperconcentrated conditions wan and wang 1994 the database comprises both wet and dry seasons as well as rising and falling limbs of hydrographs therefore it provides exhaustive at a station hydraulic geometry relationships of fine grained sand rivers with high suspended sediment concentration and is useful to illustrate the dynamics of rapidly changing cross sections above all it will be devoted here to investigate the dynamics of transient scour and fill 3 description of field data the dynamics of the channel cross section at the gauging station is better conveyed by an animation of the flow area development on a day to day basis online supplementary material ready for download at journal of hydrology discrete measured streambed points are connected to define a polygon i e channel cross section whose upper edge is the free water surface a fixed coordinate system and details on the time of the day of the measurements allow for a correct spatial temporal representation key frames from the animation are illustrated in fig 2 they represent the initial stage white an intermediate rising stage light grey and solid edge the peak stage dark grey an intermediate falling stage light grey and dashed line and the final stage black we include a boundary area 180 m wide and 10 m high which is the envelope for all the cross sections in the database the flow area moves within these boundaries expanding and shrinking initially water free surface rises and the streambed drops later this motion is present in reverse it is conceptualized with the name of transient scour and in addition renders the analogy to an accordion one hand pulling the free surface the other hand the bed thus the flood rise and fall are accompanied by scour and fill respectively however there are exceptions and the streambed rise and drop is also uneven in the cross section the deepening is not proportional to the initial depth and there is a change in the outline driving the centre of gravity with it and a shift in the thalweg at any rate scouring is mainly vertical and scarcely lateral the distortion in fig 2 must not be misleading the initial and final stages are similar in the same fashion as the two intermediate stages and no streambed degradation is observed at the end of the year however the transient scour in the annual flood with a peak on 31 january 1981 amounted to more than 3 m the five largest hydrologic events in terms of peak discharge q hereafter simply events from the fraction of the database with measured suspended sediment concentration c are selected for the analysis of transient scour fig 3 events 1 and 2 and events 4 and 5 are consecutive in the same high flow season of 1973 and 1991 respectively event 3 falls at the end of the low flow season of 1985 the combination of the free surface elevation h with either the thalweg η or the mean streambed elevation z distinctly depicts the accordion with an extent described by the evolution of the mean flow depth y h z the latter z is preferred because it is based upon the area of scour or fill between two consecutive cross section measurements defined as the net scoured area δaz fig 4 a remarkable feature in all events is a pattern of high c on the first days events 1 and 2 standing out among the others in particular c peaks two days in advance of the maximum q in event 2 and the stream rises at the same time as the maximum c 56 5 kg m3 is recorded at the beginning of event 1 both features resemble the main example in leopold and maddock 1953 because c is weakly correlated with q plots c q reveal clockwise and counterclockwise loops single valued and figure eight relations williams 1989 fan et al 2012 yang and lee 2018 the fall of η is smaller events 1 and 2 approximately the same event 4 or bigger events 3 and 5 η sinks nearly 4 m than the rise of h in general z drop is nearly the same or smaller than that of η therefore δz δη where δf is the variation between two consecutive measurements generally separated by 1 day of any variable f 4 empirical analysis of the amount of transient scour the purpose of this section is the correlation of the field data to infer the most advantageous lines of analysis the net scoured area δaz m2 0 for scour and 0 for fill and the concurrent change in flow area δa m2 are compared in fig 5 the two variables are selected because they are comparable quantities δaz is just a part of the δa and they rely solely on the field measured data the plot shows the share of the streambed scour fill δaz in the change of the flow area δa data located in the first third quadrant of fig 5 are consistent with what may be expected during the rising falling limb of the hydrograph if the transient scour analogy to an accordion is to be accepted there are some measurements in the second and fourth quadrants but the majority are located near the origin in the graph where both δa and δaz are small the identity line δaz δa line i still surface denotes an increase decrease in δa at the expense of an increase decrease of only δaz and therefore h stands still the x axis δaz 0 line ii rigid streambed describes a stationary streambed despite the increase decrease in δa that would occur at the expense of a rise fall of only h the data are predominantly in the sector delimited by both line i still surface and line ii rigid streambed the relationship δaz δa by simple linear regression line iii for data with q 350 m3 s is 1 δ a z 0 36 δ a only the regression coefficient is significant and the r squared is 0 75 on average the net scoured area accounts for the 36 of the change in flow area the two components of δaz the gross scour and the gross fill are represented by its envelope in fig 5 they reveal the unevenness in the cross section variations the bigger smaller δa is the closer to the fitting equation the gross scour fill gets in other words data scatter concentrates around low absolute values of δaz and δa if we dismiss data located in the second and fourth quadrants 24 of the data with q 350 m3 s from the analysis since they violate the accordion hypothesis the simple linear regression model results in δaz 0 39 δa and an r squared of 0 86 because a design hydrograph is usually an input to estimate general scour a simple linear regression of δaz against δq instead of δa would be more appealing as a predicting tool unfortunately such a regression lessens r squared to 0 59 as it involves flow characteristics of the alluvial channel i e whatever the relation δa δq or stage discharge relation is which are dealt with next furthermore a simple linear regression for the relationship δaz δ c q minimizes the r squared to 0 32 corroborating the weak correlation between q and c 5 brief

between 0 02 and 0 04 similar to bed slope s0 with a trend to have lower ss for higher q the relationship n q is modelled by simple linear regression for data with q 350 m3 s and at 95 confidence level the relationship n q is not significant for data with q 350 m3 s thus n 0 018 can be regarded as a constant however for the selected events n is computed with ss s0 0 03 and there is not a random scatter around the mean 0 018 fig 6 the lower threshold n 0 011 agrees with a grain roughness of 0 2 mm in the strickler formula n d 50 1 6 21 we may in principle attribute higher n values to bedforms and to the effect of high c in the context of high concentration c of fine sediment only small bedforms are expected best 2005 fredsoe and deigaard 1992 wan 1985 in addition julien 2002 predicts washed out dunes for n between 0 014 and 0 025 for c ranging from 1 to 4 kg m3 i e c one order of magnitude smaller than in the events in fig 3 in conclusion transient scour measured in the pilcomayo should not be linked to passing bedforms not only because field measurements are not maximum but average scour but because low n values do not warrant their presence field data reveal loop rating curves typically in the curve h q observed hysteresis is more pronounced in the plot v q especially in events 3 and 5 fig 7 a concomitant with a great transient scour the rising stage exhibits higher v than the falling stage thus generating a clockwise loop the plot c y fig 7b also displays clockwise loops with higher lower concentrations during rising falling limbs respectively then at a given q there is a decrease of c concomitant with a decrease in v and an increase in y although it does not necessarily imply a cause effect relation this statement agrees with leopold and maddock 1953 if a constant width b is assumed the significance of the variation of b with time is studied in following sections regarding sediment transport amarilla and amsler 2005 determined that the engelund and hansen 1967 equation eh is satisfactory to characterize the bed material transport of the pilcomayo by comparing the outcome from several equations with 10 years of data the sediment load was separated into sand 0 062 mm and 11 of the total load in average and fine sediment 0 062 mm and 89 of the total load in average sand was assigned to bed material load and fine sediment to wash load engelund hansen equation reads qt k v 2 τ 3 2 where qt is unit bed material transport v is velocity τ is shear stress and k is the constant 0 05 g 2 ρ 3 2 r 2 d 50 1 where g 9 81 m s2 ρ is water density r is ρ s ρ ρ with ρ s sediment density and d 50 is median grain size 6 analytical approach mass conservation after new evidence on transient scour and fill the analytical research on its causes starts we extend the empirical equation 1 obtained from daily measurements to a continuous change in time by replacing da b dy and daz bz dz to obtain 2 dz dt 0 36 b b z dy dt where b is the surface width and bz is the width of the streambed affected by two consecutive measurements fig 4 note that the negative sign in 2 indicates that bed scouring dz dt 0 occurs when water depth increases accordion analogy eq 2 is site specific because b bz depends on the cross section shape and the coefficient 0 36 is only valid for this site as such it should replicate the streambed evolution of the river the imperfect fitting of eq 2 for b bz 1 see fig 8 later on announces the difficulty of scour and fill prediction in the selected events indeed the large scatter for q 350 m3 s in fig 5 anticipates the disagreement in fig 8 for events 3 4 and 5 the bed scours more than the replicated then a ratio b bz higher than 1 could slightly improve the results the fitting is especially poor in the first days of events 1 and 2 and to a lesser extent first days of event 5 where channel bed aggrades contrary to the replicated an equation akin to 2 seems the ideal predicting tool yet with the coefficient varying with the relevant variables instead of being a site specific constant i e 0 36 for the pilcomayo the differential equation of sediment mass conservation is used to obtain 3 details on its derivation and the proof that the wash load does not change the streambed elevation are given in appendix a eq 3 is written as per unit width to be applied to the narrow reach of uniform width while the wide channel downstream will set its boundary condition for a general cross section see appendix a it reads 3 z t 1 λ t α c y q t x q t x where qt is the bed material transport bedload and suspended load excluding wash load α the fraction of bed material in the total depth averaged volumetric suspended sediment concentration c α 0 11 after amarilla and amsler 2005 see section 5 and λ a constant bed porosity assumed 0 4 with measured data qt α c v y unfortunately for the ideal equation the local term time variation of the right hand side of 3 only amounts to 0 2 of the total variation with our data far from the 36 on average according to 1 cui et al 2005 also argue against the importance of the local term therefore the spatial term convective derivative on the right hand side of 3 is dominant in explaining how bed elevation changes in time to sum up the depth variation at the gauging station y t seems not to be a good indicator of the capacity of a flood to scour the bed contrary to 2 when the mass conservation in differential form is used the counter example of an increasing depth in stagnant water is telling to reject an equation akin to 2 7 spatial variation versus unsteadiness the role of the spatial variation in the transient scour can be further investigated with simple differential analysis first the bed material transport qt in 3 can be equalled to a sediment transport capacity equation the eh formula that suits to the pilcomayo as stated above is chosen by using the manning equation and the water mass conservation equation y t q x 0 the spatial derivative of eh results 4 q t x 5 q t q y t 1 1 v y x other monomial sediment transport formulas and resistance equations produce similar derivatives e g the coefficient 5 would be 3 with the meyer peter and müller bed load equation and the coefficient 1 1 would be 1 with the chézy equation more importantly the local term in eq 4 is again much smaller in absolute value than the spatial term and thus it can be neglected we can estimate an average v 2 3 m s for the selected events in our database while y x 0 01 so that the term 1 1 v y x amounts to 22 m day much larger than y t the maximum is 4 m day therefore the exner equation is expressed as 5 z t 1 λ 5 5 q t q v y x eq 5 retains the dominant component in transient scour discarding the two minor local terms t in 3 and 4 and can be adapted to other mild rivers by varying sediment transport capacity and resistance formulas that lead to coefficient 5 5 ultimately non uniformity represented by the crucial spatial derivative y x unlike flow unsteadiness appears relevant to the transient scour the differential analysis can be further useful appendix b proves that the unsteady flow term is not able to explain the amount of transient scour that occurs simultaneously within a flood hydrograph therefore there must be other triggering processes of the scour let us try to provide a physical explanation of transient scour based on the hysteretic behaviour registered in the stream gauge fig 7 note in this regards that as pointed out in appendix b y x is precisely the term that accounts for the extent of the loops observed in fig 7 henderson 1966 to this purpose the analysis of the loop rating curves yq or vq curves is revealing real data plotted in these curves exhibit a large magnification of v and y x which control transient scour through eq 5 with respect to the analytical solution of the unsteady flow over a fixed bed as said before this suggests a triggering factor other than flow unsteadiness responsible for these large magnifications and large transient scour one concurrent factor is the large suspended loads exhibiting hysteresis loops as well fig 7b but another factor is the channel width change between the gauging station and the wider regions upstream and downstream the analysis of the second factor is what follows next 8 the role of the two channel widths the gauging station is located in a long contracted reach b 160 m bounded upstream and downstream by two wider reaches b 500 m straub 1935 and laursen 1958 as reported by vanoni 1975 and raudkivi 1990 studied long term equilibrium scour in a long transition under constant discharge under such steady flow width integrated sediment transport through the channel width b should be constant i e b qt x 0 the authors found that the semi empirical expression b y k constant where k is a function of the excess of shear stress with respect to the critical one is the long term steady solution that allows uniform flow to exist in both the contracted reach its normal depth called ynb and the wide reaches normal depth ynb note that since the exponent k is 1 the scoured bed area is less than the flow area lost by the contraction based on their solution the formula for the long term scour at the contracted reach is 6 δ z b b 1 k 1 y nb where δz means the difference of bed elevation between reaches eq 6 can be extended to a continuum time by assuming constant widths and non changing bed elevation in the wide reach 7 dz dt b b 1 k 1 d y nb dt to some extent eq 7 is a reach specific equation since it encompasses long distances it resembles the site specific equation 2 in the sense that the transient scour is related to temporal changes of one water depth namely the normal depth at the wide reach eq 7 with k 1 5 valid for high sediment transport vanoni 1975 is applied by computing the normal depth ynb for each daily discharge for the selected events the results together with those of eq 2 are plotted in fig 8 note that eq 7 yields predictions closer to the data although similar to eq 2 the fitting is still poor in the first days of events 1 and 2 it may be surprising that the reach specific equation 7 replicates the transient scour as well as the site specific relation the latter despite being obtained by regression of a large amount of data indeed this reach specific equation is a semi empirical formula for long term scour under steady flow which does not involve any variable of the gauging station but only the regional characteristics b b and ynb the reader may even feel that the simple equation 7 supersedes real data indeed it is understandable to question both the need of field measurements and the complexities of exner and flow equations appendices a and b what are they for contrary to what has been concluded in 6 it should be noted that time variation of one water depth ynb t does seem to be a good indicator of the capacity of a flood for scouring furthermore from fig 8 we can infer that width changes seem to trigger transient scour and that one day seems a long term regarding transient scour next section tries to reconcile the semi empiricism of eq 7 with flow and exner equations regarding the time variation of the width at the gauging station itself the coefficient 5 5 in eq 5 should be replaced by 5 5 m where 0 m 1 appendix a fig 7c shows the quotient b y as function of discharge q for two events the higher q the smaller b y i e the increase in b is smaller than the rise of y when q grows data loop because b is larger during the rising than during the falling limb for the same q and y 9 a physically based explanation once flow unsteadiness is proved negligible section 7 an explanation on the grounds of the quasi steady gradually varied flow equations on an erodible bed in the contracted reach with a boundary condition at the expanded reach downstream is tested the reach is assumed prismatic i e all cross sections downstream are equal to the one at the gauging station all time there is no alternative for this bold assumption since the field work and bed survey was limited as customarily to one gauging station appendix c explains the rationale of this physically based model it is concluded that scour is expected during the rising limb a drawdown profile occurs but fill during the falling limb a backwater profile if discharge remains constant channel bed is bound to approach an equilibrium condition in which the difference in bed elevations between the contracted and the wide reaches equals the difference in uniform flow depths between them because uniform flow occurs throughout this is the assumption supporting eqs 6 and 7 in this sense the physically based model should tend asymptotically to eq 7 under a constant discharge how much time the model needs to do so is the last issue to reconcile appendix d provides a demonstration that eq 6 can be derived from steady gradually varied flow so that 7 express the spatial flow variation the main cause of transient scour in another way thus 6 is semi theoretical rather than semi empirical and the good performance of 7 to replicate real data becomes more comprehensible the approximate eq 3 and the analytical solution of the gradually varied flow by the bresse function henderson 1966 are preferred in the physically based model the tabulated bresse function retains the essence of the spatial variation in a wide prismatic channel while avoiding numerical models too skilled for such a simplified hypothetical geometry once a flow solver the bresse function is included in the model bed elevation changes at the gauging station are calculated by using the integral approach of eq 3 this approach does not lose resolution nor accuracy with respect to the differential approach and has the advantage of highlighting the reach length that experiences transient scour and thus it indirectly involves a morphodynamic time scale eq 3 is integrated with respect to space x and time t in a control volume of length l within the prismatic narrow reach l 2000 m and then extended to the elapsed time between two measurements δt 8 δ z l 1 λ t t δ t q t t l q t t 0 d t 0 where qt t 0 and qt t l are the bed material transport at the gauging station x 0 and at a distance x l downstream in the narrow reach respectively the control volume length l not known in principle must be commensurate with the distance travelled by the bed wave generating transient scour during the integration time δt 1 day note that the ratio l δt is the celerity of the bed wave or contains the inverse of the morphodynamic time scale as data are only available at x 0 m the time integral in eq 8 is rewritten as 9 t t δ t q t t l q t t 0 d t β 1 t t δ t q t t 0 d t where β encompasses the gradually varied flow within distance l and is defined as the ratio between bed material transport capacities at x l m and x 0 m it is derived from the tabulated bresse function the trapezoidal rule is applied to the time integral of qt and finally eq 9 is substituted into eq 8 to obtain 10 δ z 1 λ δ t l β 1 q t t 0 q t t δ t 0 2 11 β 1 2 q t t l q t t 0 q t t δ t l q t t δ t 0 where β has been averaged between two measurements one day apart δt 1 the solution of eq 10 is implicit and spatial derivatives are fully avoided except for β and the length l controlling the speed of the bed wave all other quantities in eq 10 are variables present in the database only to be consistent with the bresse function solver the eh formula is used in eq 11 for both qt l and qt 0 at any time the parameter β is a function of l and the differences in bed elevations δz and normal depths δyn between the contracted and wide reaches in addition total energy losses are neglected between the narrow and the wide sections at the outlet of the contracted reach for successive steps δyn changes according to q so the comparison between δz and δyn induces a drawdown β 1 the flow accelerates or a backwater β 1 the flow slows down see appendix c the streambed change δz is assumed completed at each δt and thus a volume δz l is scoured or filled and δz is updated every δt eq 10 is a robust convergence model for the database as it converges to an equilibrium scour for a constant q δz at the beginning of the computation day 1 is obtained by using eq 10 with the event s first day q but extended for a long time i e long term scour 10 results and discussion of scour and fill the integration length l is selected after a sensitivity analysis fig 9 shows the evolution of z for event 3 modelled with eq 10 with measured qt and α 0 11 see section 6 and a range of l between 50 m and 1950 m 2000 m separating the gauging station from the downstream transition note that the smaller the l the less dynamic the transient scour and vice versa modelled z for all selected events is obtained from eq 10 with l 1950 m in three ways shown in fig 10 if measured data are used qt is computed with α 0 11 and α 0 33 and is called replication if no measured data are used the eh formula is used to obtain qt and is called prediction the increase in bed material load in the measured suspension load by using α 0 33 instead of the average α 0 11 means that part of the assumed wash load is no longer wash load but interacts with the bed and thus enhances the dynamics of scour and fill discussion of the reach and site specific fig 8 and physically based model fig 10 follows 1 the physically based model traces fairly well the streambed evolution capturing the order of magnitude and the sign i e the analogy to an accordion of the transient scour and fill however modelled scour is smaller than measured in events 4 and 5 slightly smaller in event 3 and sometimes larger in events 1 and 2 although this may be deemed a poor performance for a model a number of assumptions and simplifications e g flow prismatic geometry and control volume led to eq 10 2 bed evolution is more dynamic for α 0 33 than in the other cases it gets closer to the measured data in events 3 4 and 5 yet farther in events 1 and 2 it follows that the definition of wash load based upon the separation of sand and finer sediment at size 0 062 mm may not be satisfactory for the phenomena of transient scour and fill obviously parameter α provides a means of tuning the model results which would be arbitrary without a deeper knowledge of the physics of suspended sediment transport 3 both prediction and replication results have the same relative success the choice of an appropriate sediment transport formula eh in this research may be credited for this success 4 differences between sediment supply and transport at capacity conditions do not explain the disagreement between model results and data instead they are the cause of the little difference between replication and prediction although the so called non equilibrium conditions supply capacity entail scour and fill the observed shortage of sediment load in event 5 makes little difference in the results see fig a1c 5 results from eqs 2 and 7 are very similar fig 8 although the latter exaggerates the scour displayed by the former especially in event 3 again scour is smaller than data in events 4 and 5 and the performance is poor in events 1 and 2 overall eq 7 is not worse than eq 2 as a replication of the streambed data 6 the discrepancy between eqs 2 and 7 in event 3 and not as much in other events may be attributed to their dates 1973 1985 and 1991 the pilcomayo is changing over time martín vide et al 2012 planform changes in downstream reaches modify the stage discharge relationship that affects ynb moreover ynb is not allowed to change over time in the model if the wide region downstream aggrades while the contracted region scours backwater is promoted in the contracted reach and thus a more rapid recovery from scour event 5 on the contrary clearly displays how the model is struggling to recover from scour 7 the success of eq 7 in replicating field data highlights the change in width from b to b as the main cause and triggering factor of the transient scour and fill the widening downstream explains most of the transient scour and fill within the contracted reach at low flow the two channel widths are probably similar but as the flow rises they may start to differ and thus to trigger bed scouring this point fully supports the assertion by colby 1964 8 eqs 2 and 7 fail when c is maximum first days of events 1 and 2 and when c peaks in advance of the maximum q event 2 and to a certain extent the first days of event 5 because they produce large scours whereas the actual bed slightly fills or scours the physically based model improves results and so it is postulated that large sediment loads are another cause of transient scour and fill superimposed on the expansion downstream this second cause is in accordance with leopold and maddock 1953 as quoted in the introduction examples of the yellow river in the hyperconcentrated flow domain wan and wang 1994 show large bed fills under huge sediment loads in an almost chaotic way sediment loads in the pilcomayo although much lower than those in the yellow river may be on the verge of a similar behaviour in events 1 and 2 different from current understanding of scour and fill according to colby 1964 9 as well as the good performance of 7 the ability of the system to approach rapidly any scour or fill stage was also striking one day is a long enough time for the bed to adjust to changes in flow this suggests that the morphodynamic time scale of bed change is similar to the time scale at which the flow is changing figs 9 and 10 prove that the contracted reach length is commensurate with the distance travelled by the bed wave of the transient scour and fill in one day the celerity of such a scour or fill wave of a magnitude of meters is then about 2 km day this figure is similar to 3 6 km day obtained from the approximation of the celerity of a bed disturbance in the differential analysis of the flow equations with exner under all the assumptions of shallow water flow de vries 1975 garde and ranga raju 1985 for the selected events it is computed as a v q t q 1 λ 1 fr 2 where a 5 is the exponent in the eh function q t v a fr 0 3 is the froude number q t q 0 02 and v 2 3 m s 10 the results of the physically based model and eq 7 are comparable apart from events 1 and 2 where the model performs better this is discouraging because flow profile sediment transport and time included in the physically based model are not necessary to predict transient scour and fill actually the expansion from b to b appears to override all other factors the similarities between these results not only confirm the support to colby 1964 but also mean that the expansion is necessarily acting through the intermediate mechanisms of flow profile sediment transport and time 11 conclusions new field data showcasing rapidly varying cross sections in a long contracted sand bed reach from a gauging station draining 96 000 km2 in the pilcomayo river is presented the maximum recorded suspended sediment load and streambed scour in one day are 60 kg m3 and 4 m respectively the objective is to check whether the often narrow gauging stations explain the transient scour and fill as asserted by colby 1964 reinforced by vanoni 1975 and currently understood or the changes in sediment supply are the cause of the observed scour and fill as asserted by leopold and maddock 1953 exner equation elaborating on its convective term leads to eq 5 for transient scour and fill which can be generalized to other rivers water depth gradients y x during a flood are crucial in the phenomenon indeed large differences in y x between the rising and falling limb are observed in the data thus displaying large hysteresis loops on the contrary the analytical solution in unsteady flow produces a negligible transient scour yet having the correct sign then the unsteadiness cannot explain the transient scour in spite of occurring simultaneously once river bed starts to fall scouring is self sustaining in the sense that the change in y x and the scour or fill explain each other by the flow equations the remaining question is the triggering factor that starts either the scour or the increase in y x incidentally suspended sediment concentration data loop simultaneously with flow variables as described by leopold and maddock 1953 however this does not imply a cause effect relation in fact the self sustaining scour does not need suspended sediment load in the explanation the quasi steady gradually varied flow in a long contraction with a boundary condition downstream coupled with the sediment mass conservation in a control volume leads to eq 10 this model is consistent with the equilibrium scour in long transitions the increase decrease in discharge determines a drawdown backwater profile which in turn determines bed elevation changes i e scour fill the term β 1 multiplied by the total bed material load has a different sign for drawdown and backwater conditions and is null in uniform flow conditions non uniformity not pure unsteadiness is relevant to transient scour the results prove that the expansion downstream of the long contracted reach explains most of the transient scour and fill through non uniform flow and bed material suspended load however as this fails on days of highest concentrations 40 kg m3 when the physically based model results are better it is postulated that large sediment loads are another cause of transient scour and fill superimposed on the expansion downstream it should be noted that equilibrium scour in long transitions eq 7 fully supports colby 1964 lastly leopold and maddock 1953 raised coincidental observations to causal statements although their observations are confirmed by our new data we adhere to the refutation by colby 1964 with new arguments narrow sites cause transient scour even in long transitions such as in the pilcomayo this is intimately connected with flow and sediment transport as eq 10 accounts for unlike eq 7 the large sediment load as another cause of transient scour and fill is not a vindication of the main contents of leopold and maddock 1953 this postulate cannot be more precise at this point except for a it does not have to do with the non equilibrium conditions supply capacity and b it does not have to do with the total suspended load partitioned between wash load not interacting with the bed and bed

1 2 henderson 1966 this function of y x represents the extent of the loop in our data the hysteresis fig 7a and the transient scour fig 3 are concomitant and a large hysteresis comes with a large transient scour are therefore hysteresis and transient scour linked by a cause and effect relationship the mass and momentum equations in unsteady shallow water flow are a14 the diffusive wave jain 2001 is an approximation that only keeps those terms under the grey dashed lines of a14 the routing of the flood in a diffusive wave follows a diffusion equation the equation needs an initial wave at

analytical solution with the values in the database events 2 and 5 are selected because they resemble the sine wave fig a1a the hysteresis is extremely narrow in the analytical solution but very broad in the data v q clockwise in fig a1e and anticlockwise y q in fig a1d thus in the analytical solution y x hardly changes between the rising and falling limb whereas the change in the actual data y x is very big in other words the actual gradients y x are much exaggerated with respect to the analytical ones almost imperceptible similarly for the actual velocities v foreseeably the change in streambed elevation computed with eq 5 after introducing the analytical results of y x therein is only 1 of the scour in the database fig a1b in which the analytical transient scour is multiplied by 70 in the end apart from the correct sign the flow unsteadiness explains very little 1 of the transient scour z t because the change in gradient y x is almost negligible numerical experiments with saint venant and exner equations using a bed load predictor over a plane erodible bed express similar conclusions concerning the negligibility of transient scour due to unsteady flow medina and bateman 2010 finally qt computed with the eh formula for the analytical wave is compared with the actual bed material load from the database assuming the ratio of bed material transport to total sediment transport is constant α 0 11 fig a1c on event 2 the actual sediment transport is markedly larger than the computed one in the rising limb but the difference vanishes in the falling limb on event 5 the trend is alike for the first days yet with a large actual shortage around the peak sediment supply and transport capacity eh are not equal appendix c gradually varied flow and transient scour let us consider eq a14 with the local terms neglected therein only those terms above black dotted lines are kept the actual flow is well portrayed by subsequent steady stages of constant q i e a quasi steady flow the dynamic equation then stands for the gradually varied flow in the form of backwater m1 and drawdown m2 surface profiles in subcritical flow a boundary condition downstream applies the 2500 m long contracted reach assumed prismatic with the gauging station in it is a long transition because the flow is controlled by friction and slope apart from the downstream depth control moreover since all changes either scour or fill take part of this prismatic geometry it follows that river bed is assumed straight and parallel to the initial bed throughout the contracted reach a single bed slope s0 thus occurs in space and time first a rigid bed is considered and the downstream condition is the normal depth in the wide b region ynb water depth in the contracted reach width b will approach its own normal depth ynb asymptotically in the upstream direction since b b the difference between normal depths δyn ynb ynb is δyn 0 at any q δ stands for a spatial difference also at different daily stages of q separated by δq δ stands for 1 day difference changes in normal depths verify δynb δynb simply because b b again the two surface profiles m1 and m2 allow for an initial difference δz in the streambed elevation between wide and contracted reaches the sign δz 0 means the narrow is lower fig a2 a drawdown occurs if δz δyn and a backwater if δz δyn in case of drawdown flow accelerates v x 0 leading to an increase in bed shear stress τ x 0 and therefore in sediment transport capacity qt x 0 the situation is reverse in case of backwater according to exner see eq a8 channel bed scours in case of a drawdown curve z t 0 whereas it is filled in case a backwater curve z t 0 occurs the erodible bed behaviour can be approached on the same lines whenever the surface profile prevails as a drawdown curve in a stage of q river bed in the contracted reach will be scoured so the difference δz increases and approaches δy n the opposite response occurs when a backwater curve prevails channel bed will be filled decreasing δz to approach δyn then the quasi steady flow is approached similarly the drawdown curve is bound to prevail if discharge rises δq 0 because δyn increases i e δynb δynb conversely the backwater curve is bound to prevail if discharge falls δq 0 because δyn decreases i e δynb δynb to sum up scour and fill are expected during the rising and falling limbs respectively so the analogy to an accordion is depicted if δq 0 river bed is bound to approach an equilibrium condition with δz δyn and uniform flow prevails throughout the flow depth is ynb in the narrow reach and ynb in the wide in the quasi steady approach of daily changes δq actual velocities are higher than uniform velocities and y x s0 in case of a drawdown curve which occurs if δq 0 if the water surface profile is a backwater curve occurring when δq 0 the situation is reverse i e actual velocities are lower than uniform velocities and y x s0 this property is intrinsic of gradually varied flow thus depending on whether δz is bigger or smaller than δyn the scour or fill produces a change in y x and v so that it feeds itself back into the transient scour which according to eq 5 is proportional to the product v y x in other words the transient scour is self sustaining i e the exaggeration of v and y x observed in the real hysteresis loops can be explained by transient scour itself and vice versa in a sort of feedback appendix d derivation of vanoni equation from gradually varied flow it is well known that the gradually varied flow equation

6299,seawater intrusion modelling is often used to assist with groundwater management in coastal areas and islands although smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph schemes are able to simulate multi fluid flows in porous media they have not been widely tested against experimental observations yet additionally numerical methods for groundwater flow problems need to be able to simulate pumping which is an unexplored area in sph in this study an explicit incompressible sph eisph solver for multi fluid flow in porous media is used to simulate the dynamics of freshwater lenses in small islands and is further developed to simulate groundwater pumping and associated seawater upconing three methods to implement a sink term that models water pumping from an aquifer are proposed and compared the model is successfully tested against data from published laboratory scale experiments and other numerical models the results of eisph are comparable to other models the inclusion of a sink for water particles to simulate pumping did not affect the stability of the simulations although one of the three methods led to results that better compared to experimental data hence sph modelling of groundwater flows in porous media can be successfully achieved using the methods developed here keywords smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph explicit incompressible sph eisph freshwater lens upconing pumping porous media sink 1 introduction seawater intrusion in groundwater aquifers is a global issue that threatens availability of potable freshwater in coastal zones a naturally occurring process seawater intrusion is often enhanced by changes in fresh groundwater levels caused by pumping through extraction wells and land use change werner et al 2013 the change in groundwater levels causes reductions in the pressure exerted by overlying freshwater columns leading to upward intrusion of underlying seawater bertorelle 2014 the intrusion reduces freshwater storage volume and might contaminate freshwater extraction wells werner et al 2013 seawater intrusion is also of great importance in oceanic islands where fresh groundwater is often the only potable water source stoeckl and houben 2012 in oceanic islands fresh groundwater often floats over underlying seawater due to the density difference this floating body of freshwater is called a lens stoeckl and houben 2012 stoeckl et al 2016 freshwater lenses in oceanic islands often have limited thickness and are separated from the underlying seawater by a mixing zone dynamics of the mixing zone at the interface between freshwater and seawater are governed by a density dependent multi fluid flow werner et al 2017 factors associated with changes in rainfall regimes and excessive pumping of freshwater can reduce the thickness of these lenses as well as increase the possibility of seawater intrusion to extraction wells stoeckl and houben 2012 werner et al 2017 to investigate the process of seawater intrusion and understand the vulnerability of fresh groundwater aquifers numerous methods such as field monitoring techniques analytical studies and numerical models have been developed werner et al 2013 field techniques such as direct sampling and remote sensing white 1996 are used as the basis for empirical equations werner et al 2017 analytical solutions have been developed to predict the position of an interface between freshwater and seawater these methods mostly assume a sharp interface between two immiscible fluids and are derived for simplified steady state conditions in homogeneous aquifers vacher 1988 fetter 1972 dagan and bear 1968 numerical methods have been developed to overcome the limitations of analytical solutions and are able to model transient development of the interface of miscible fluids in aquifers with spatial hydraulic heterogeneity numerical models mostly solve a variable density multi fluid flow coupled with a solute transport equation werner et al 2013 the most commonly used codes are sutra voss et al 2002 and seawat langevin et al 2008 which solve the equations using finite elements and finite differences respectively readers are referred to werner et al 2013 2017 for a comprehensive review of common analytical and numerical studies recently particle methods such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph have been used to simulate multi fluid flow in porous media with applications to lock exchange basser et al 2017 pahar and dhar 2017 particle methods have been shown to have performance similar to conventional mesh based methods with the advantage to reduce numerical diffusivity herrera et al 2009 the modelling of anisotropic dispersion of solutes is one of the challenges faced by sph schemes with effort being dedicated to the reduction of the occurrence of negative concentrations avesani et al 2015 2017 however the use of sph schemes for the modelling of solute dispersion against experimental data are still rare further quantitative studies with applications to engineering problems are required to test the capability of sph to simulate multi fluid flow in porous media specifically the simulation of problems including pumping from wells requires modelling a mass sink one of the challenges associated with simulating a mass sink is tracking the particles around the sink point to ensure a well organised distribution of the particles to ensure an accurate sph approximation another challenge is defining how to remove mass associated with the extracted freshwater the aim of this study is thus to investigate the applicability of an sph scheme explicit incompressible sph eisph basser et al 2017 to simulate freshwater lens formations in islands and sea water upconing due to pumping an algorithm to simulate point mass sinks was developed and is presented here with applicability to water pumping 2 methods 2 1 governing equations the 2d governing equations for a flow of two or more incompressible fluids in

associated with each particle are estimated using neighbouring particles readers are referred to monaghan 1992 1994 2012 for a general description of the particle approximation only key features of the model used in this study are presented here the spatial volume v of particles in porous media with spatially varying porosity is determined in accordance with the porosity of the media such that when a particle moves into a medium with lower porosity the same amount of mass occupies a larger volume i e v i m i i ρ i where m is the fluid mass of the particle and i refers to the i th particle

where there is no porous medium the eisph method was used to solve eqs 1 3 nomeritae et al 2016 a detailed description of the numerical scheme used here is presented in appendix a 2 3 modelling a point sink to carry out sph simulations of problems including water extraction through wells a method to describe a sink for the extraction of water mass must be developed in a point sink such as suction or pumping acting at a point the fluid surrounding the sink point moves toward the sink point in sph this means that fluid particles should move toward the sink point and a portion of the fluid s mass should be removed at a rate equal to the sink rate the extraction of the mass from a point is included in eq 1 bear and bachmat 2012 in the form of fluid flux per unit of volume γ and is approximated as 8 γ k 1 s q k δ x x k where k is the k th sink point s denotes the number of sink points q is the sink rate and δ is the dirac function eq 8 describes fluid flux per unit volume due to sinks the contributions of sinks for particle i is approximated as 9 γ i k 1 s q k δ x i x k k 1 s q k ζ k w ik where ζ is a normalization factor equivalent to an approximation of constant 1 and defined as monaghan 2005 monaghan et al 2005 10 1 ζ k j 1 n m j j ρ j w jk in eq 9 sink points within a distance equal to the radius of the support of the kernel function from particle i are used to calculate γ therefore a sink point directly affects the particles sink particles hereafter within a distance equal to the radius of the support domain of the kernel function from the sink point the particles outside the direct influence of the sink point are indirectly affected through their interaction with the sink particles the term γ contributes to the pressure poisson equation eq 21 causing the pressure of the particles surrounding the sink point to change in a way that they move towards the sink point each particle in sph carries a certain amount of fluid mass and in order to account for the mass extraction due to the sink it is unavoidable to reduce the particles mass and delete particles where and when necessary three different methods for deleting particles are proposed to investigate their advantages and disadvantages 2 3 1 solely particle removal spr in this method the mass reduction due to the sink is handled by just deleting particles while maintaining the total particle mass constant in between deletion individual particle mass still needs to be updated due to changes in scalar concentration according to eq 7 one particle is deleted after a certain number of time steps the duration t p required to delete one particle is determined using the volume of fluid in a particle and the sink rate such that 11 t p v q where v is a spatial volume section 2 2 associated with a particle and v is the volume of fluid that each particle carries mass is reduced i e one particle is removed at every time step that is a multiple of t p i e at times t α t p α being an integer every time t α t p the particle closest to the sink point is removed fig 1 a because the sink particles move toward the sink point due to the inclusion of γ in the pressure poisson equation eq 21 the particle deletion does not lead to a void in the vicinity of the sink point 2 3 2 mass reduction and particle removal mrpr similar to spr one particle is removed every certain number of time steps however in contrast to spr the mass of sink particles is gradually reduced every time step before one particle is deleted the amount of mass reduction in one time step is divided among the sink particles and subtracted from each sink particle s mass the mass required to be removed is partitioned between sink particles in two ways 1 in accordance to the kernel value mrpr k so that the particles closer to a sink point lose more mass than the distant ones or 2 evenly mrpr e therefore the amount of mass extracted from each particle is determined using the sink rate time step value kernel value used in mrpr k and number of sink particles used in mrpr e when the time required to delete one particle α t p is reached the closest particle to the sink point is removed and the mass of the remaining sink particles is set back to their initial mass value fig 1b 2 3 3 constant mass reduction cmr in this method the mass of the sink particles is gradually reduced every time step as in mrpr e the reduction in mass of the sink particles continues until the mass of a sink particle drops below a cut off value which here is set to 1 of particles initial mass value at which time the particle is removed fig 1c the reduction of mass in accordance to the kernel value as in mrpr k was found problematic as continuous reduction of particles mass causes clumping of particles close to a sink point this is further explained in section 3 2 2 4 choice of kernel the selection of a kernel function and smoothing length in a problem in media with different porosities should be handled carefully the spatial volume that an sph particle occupies within a porous medium represents both fluid and solid phases volume therefore a fluid particle with a given mass within a porous medium has a larger spatial volume than a particle in a free flow domain with the same mass having a larger spatial volume causes the particles to move apart from each other leading to a loss of resolution inside the porous medium therefore the number of particles inside the support domain of the kernel function reduces and might not be sufficient to accurately approximate the variable values and derivatives to tackle this problem a kernel function with a larger support domain should be used or the smoothing length should be adjusted pahar and dhar 2016 the former approach might lead to an excessive smoothing of the variable values at the free flow domain furthermore using a larger support domain increases the number of interactions in the free flow domain leading to a higher computational cost here we use a variable smoothing length additional terms associated with the derivative of smoothing length are added to the momentum equation price and monaghan 2004 however these terms are neglected here a cubic spline weighting function liu and liu 2003 with a variable smoothing length was used here and is given by 12 w q h α d 2 3 q 2 1 2 q 3 0 q 1 1 6 2 q 3 1 q 2 0 q 2 where α d is a normalisation constant equal to 1 h 15 7 π h 2 or 3 2 π h 3 in one two and three dimensional domains respectively and q x i x j h x ij h in 2d we choose the smoothing length to be inversely proportional to the square root of porosity as 13 h i 1 2 δ x i where δ x is the average distance between fluid particles therefore in a medium with lower porosity the smoothing length is larger because the same value of smoothing length should be used for a pair of interacting particles to conserve momentum the smoothing length for interacting particles i and j is calculated as h ij h i h j 2 rafiee et al 2007 2 5 boundaries 2 5 1 solid boundaries a single layer of virtual particles is used to impose the impermeable boundaries at walls virtual particles interact with fluid particles and prevent them from penetrating the walls by exerting a lennard jones repulsive force given by monaghan 1994 14 f x ij v l r c x ij c 1 r c x ij c 2 1 x ij r c x ij 1 0 r c x ij 1 with c 1 and c 2 equal to 4 and 2 respectively v l is the square of the largest velocity in a flow and r c represents a cut off distance which is set to 0 8 times the initial distance between virtual particles the virtual particles are fixed in their position and never move the initial distance between the virtual particles is set to half the initial distance between the fluid particles to ensure the impermeability of the walls 2 5 2 free no slip boundaries ghost particles are used to impose free slip and no slip boundary conditions ghost particles are created by mirroring the fluid particles within a distance of 2 h from the solid boundaries liu and liu 2003 a ghost particle carries the same properties of the associated fluid particle to impose no slip boundary condition both components of velocity parallel and normal are reversed while for free slip conditions only the normal component is reversed marrone et al 2011 our investigations and previous studies e g nomeritae et al 2016 basser et al 2017 showed that ghost particles alone were not able to prevent particles from penetrating the solid walls therefore the ghost particles were used together with the virtual particles 2 5 3 inflow boundaries inflow particles are used to simulate inflow of fluid into the domain nomeritae et al 2018 the thickness of the zone occupied by inflow particles i e the inflow zone is set to be larger than the radius of the support domain of the kernel function inflow particles within the inflow zone are moved with a constant velocity determined by the inflow rate once an inflow particle moves outside the inflow zone it is turned into a fluid particle and moves according to the governing equations the inflow particles velocity and pressure are used in approximating the hydrodynamics of the fluid particles in a domain but not vice versa federico et al 2012 2 5 4 free surface boundaries a pressure p 0 is assigned to free surface particles the free surface particles are detected using fluid particles densities as in basser et al 2017 3 results the model is applied to two experimental studies to test different aspects of the method and validate it the experimental coastal freshwater lens in an isotropic porous medium studied in stoeckl and houben 2012 is simulated to check the capability of the model to reproduce the dynamics of fresh and salt water in a porous medium the experiment of salt water upconing induced by fresh water pumping studied in werner et al 2009 was simulated to validate the proposed sink algorithm and demonstrate the capability of the sph scheme to reproduce upconing of salt water in groundwater aquifers 3 1 laboratory scale coastal freshwater lens an experiment of formation of a coastal freshwater lens in a cone shape strip island was presented in stoeckl and houben 2012 in the experiment a cone shape submerged island 1 8 m long 0 3 m deep and 0 05 m wide was utilized fig 2 the porosity and mean hydraulic conductivity of the porous medium were given as 0 39 and k 4 5 10 3 m s 1 respectively the salt and fresh water densities were ρ s 1021 2 kg m 3 and ρ f 997 4 kg m 3 respectively initially the island was saturated up to y 0 3 m with salt water to represent the ocean freshwater was recharged with a rate equal to q 1 33 10 5 m s 1 through a set of drips above the sand cone the recharged fresh water penetrated into the porous medium i e island and formed a freshwater lens as shown in fig 2 as the experiment progressed an amount of freshwater discharged from the island to the surrounding salt water representing the ocean this water was skimmed from the salt water surface fig 2 to maintain a constant salt water level stoeckl and houben 2012 in the simulation a plane of symmetry was assumed requiring only half of the experimental domain to be simulated this is similar to the numerical study performed in stoeckl et al 2016 the left side of the island was simulated and a free slip boundary condition was used on the right wall of the domain to satisfy the symmetry of the flow the initial spacing between fluid particles δ x δ y was set to 0 005 m in the ocean and 0 005 m in the island the smoothing length h was set to 1 2 δ x with δ x varying in the ocean and island the time step was set to 2 10 4 s the dynamic viscosity for the fresh water was set to μ f 10 3 pa s and it was assumed to be μ s 1 05 10 3 pa s for the salt water isdale et al 1972 the calculated permeability was κ 4 6 10 10 m 2 using the properties of freshwater and hydraulic conductivity no slip boundary conditions were imposed on the left and bottom solid boundaries the longitudinal and transverse dispersivity included in eq 32 were set to d l 5 10 4 m and d t 5 10 5 m and the coefficient of molecular diffusivity was set to d m 10 9 m 2 s 1 stoeckl et al 2016 the freshwater recharge at the surface of the island was simulated using an inflow boundary condition section 2 5 3 the pressure within the inflow zone was set to be hydrostatic at every time step outside the island particles that moved above y 0 3 m were deleted to keep the water level constant and mimic the experimental procedure fig 3 shows the freshwater lens and the pressure distribution at different times the coarser resolution of particles in the porous medium is due to the definition of spatial volume that changes in accordance to porosity of the medium experimental or numerical pressure measurements are not available and a qualitative discussion is reported here the value of maximum pressure in the porous medium is higher than that of the free flow domain this is due to the extra pressure imposed by the inflow particles over the surface of the island it was found that changing the thickness of the inflow zone which changed the hydrostatic pressure at the surface of the island accordingly affected the maximum thickness of the lens predicted numerically our investigations showed that the thickness of the inflow zone should be equal to the radius of the support domain of the kernel function the definition of pressure at inflow boundary condition in sph is still an open issue with examples nomeritae et al 2018 showing the need to adjust the size of inflow zone to reproduce experimental data oscillations in pressure values occurred at the interface between the free flow domain and the porous medium fig 3 this might be due to the fact that for a support domain with its centre located right over the interface there are different numbers of particles within it from the two media our investigations showed that these oscillations do not significantly affect the numerical results it was found that with the proper boundary arrangements the transient formation as well as the maximum thickness of the lens were reasonably reproduced the numerical maximum thickness of the lens occurred close to the right boundary which is in agreement with the experimental and numerical results in stoeckl and houben 2012 and stoeckl et al 2016 the maximum depth predicted numerically was 16 cm and occurred in the middle of the island after 200 min this was close to the maximum thickness measured experimentally 15 cm that occurred at the same time it is observed in fig 3 that the density of salt water in the free flow domain at the interface between the free flow domain and the porous medium and close to the free surface is lower than the salt water density this was due to a horizontal flow within the lens from the symmetry boundary toward the left this was observed in the experiment stoeckl and houben 2012 and numerical benchmark by stoeckl et al 2016 it was also found that an amount of the discharged fresh water into the ocean moved back to the island and again converged with the horizontal flow of lens water into the salt water surface fig 3 t 200 min this represents the direction of the salt water flow from the free flow domain into the porous medium a similar flow direction was observed in the simulation of stoeckl et al 2016 it is observed that the thickness of the transition between freshwater and salt water is larger close to the symmetry boundary likely due to the higher vertical velocity of particles close to the symmetry boundary as the effective dispersion matrix is proportional to the velocity of particles the simulation was repeated for four other recharge rates and the maximum lens thickness was compared to numerical and analytical solutions stoeckl and houben 2012 fetter 1972 vacher 1988 to investigate the capability of the model to predict the maximum thickness as a function of recharge rate as observed in fig 4 a and b the eisph results are in good agreement with the numerical and analytical results the results show that the eisph can be used to well simulate applications associated with multi fluid flows in porous media 3 2 salt water upconing in a two dimensional aquifer a series of experiments of salt water upconing were presented in werner et al 2009 and their experiment 2 was used for comparison of the simulations here in the experiment a tank 1 18 m long 1 2 m deep and 0 053 m wide was used as shown in fig 5 four pipes fed freshwater and one pipe fed salt water to the tank from both sides the conductance i e resistance of the porous medium against the inflow was measured as m f 2 84 10 6 m 2 s 1 and m s 1 62 10 6 m 2 s 1 for the fresh water and salt water respectively jakovovic et al 2011 initially the tank was filled up to 0 15 m with salt water and 1 m depth of fresh water was filled over the salt water leading to an overall depth h b 1 15 m i e the fresh water head measured from the base of the tank fresh water was extracted using an extraction well with diameter equal to 0 012 m at the rate q p 7 10 5 m 2 s 1 the well was placed in the middle of the tank at a depth of 0 65 m from the top of the tank so that the distance between the well bottom to the initial interface of freshwater and salt water was 0 4 m jakovovic et al 2011 the freshwater inflow to the well occurred at the lower 0 1 m of it the porosity and hydraulic conductivity were given as 0 38 and k 1 6 10 3 m s 1 respectively the density of the salt and fresh water were ρ s 1025 kg m 3 and ρ f 998 kg m 3 respectively werner et al 2009 jakovovic et al 2011 two manometers were attached at the boundaries at both sides to measure any drawdown in the fresh water and salt water head as the freshwater and salt water head dropped at the boundaries an inflow was induced to feed the domain with both freshwater and salt water therefore the side boundaries acted as head dependent boundaries in the simulation the initial spacing between fluid particles δ x δ y was set to 0 005 m the smoothing length h was set to 1 2 δ x and the time step was 2 10 4 s the dynamic viscosity for the fresh water was set to μ f 10 3 pa s and it was assumed to be μ s 1 05 10 3 pa s for salt water isdale et al 1972 the calculated permeability was κ 1 67 10 10 m 2 using the parameters of salt water and hydraulic conductivity the lower section of the well dashed zone in fig 5 where freshwater was flowing into was treated as a high permeability section i e the drag force in eq 6 was set to zero and its length was assumed to be 0 05 m jakovovic et al 2011 the sink point location was set at the middle of the permeable zone a no slip boundary condition was imposed at the bottom solid boundary the coefficient of molecular diffusivity was set to d m 10 9 m 2 s 1 and the longitudinal and transverse dispersivity were set to d l 2 10 3 m and d t 1 10 4 m jakovovic et al 2011 the fresh water and salt water recharge were simulated using an inflow boundary condition section 2 5 3 with the rate of the inflow determined according to the boundaries time dependent head the inflow was simulated as a continuously distributed recharge rather than inflow nodes or pipes this was due to the nature of sph as a kernel close to the boundaries needs to be filled with particles to result in an accurate approximation the width of the inflow zones on the left and right boundaries were set to 0 04 m which was larger than the radius of the support of the kernel function the inflow rate for fresh water q f m s 1 and salt water q s m s 1 was calculated using the conductance initial boundary head h b and time dependent internal head at the boundaries h t as jakovovic et al 2011 15 q f m f h b h t h b 0 15 4 0 053 and 16 q s m s h b h t 0 15 0 053 where h t was assumed to be the average of the freshwater heads on the left and right boundaries to ensure a symmetrical inflow as it was observed in the experiment werner et al 2009 fig 6 shows the density distribution and transient development of the upconing below the extraction well using the method spr see section 2 3 in the early stages of the experiment werner et al 2009 a wave like interface rise was observed however this wasn t observed in our simulation this might be due to the continuously distributed inflow conditions on the sides of the tank because the wave like interface rise was due to the localised circulations induced by the node inflows in the experiment jakovovic et al 2011 the qualitative observation is in agreement with one of the simulations in jakovovic et al 2011 where a continuously distributed inflow was used the dispersion zone at the interface between fresh water and salt water especially in the later stages of the simulation was wider than the experimental dispersion zone our investigations showed that using a smaller values for longitudinal and transverse dispersivity did not considerably affect the dispersion zone width a thicker dispersion zone but with smaller extent was also observed in the simulations of jakovovic et al 2011 this thicker dispersion zone might be related to the assumption in the sph approximation of the diffusion equation see eqs 31 34 fig 7 a illustrates the upconing height as a function of time the numerical height of the upconing was determined based on the simulated 50 salinity contour jakovovic et al 2011 it was observed that the spr method led to results comparatively closer to the experimental observations fig 7b shows the error bar for the spr method the cmr method considerably overestimated the upconing heigh possibly because of the particle distribution pattern around the sink point fig 8 shows the particles around the sink point for the three sink methods the particles have an ordered distribution around the sink point in the spr while the particles are clumped for cmr method the clumping in cmr is due to the continuous reduction of mass for the sink particles until their mass drops to zero with the density of the particles around the sink point staying constant the reduction in mass causes the particles to get closer to the sink point therefore any support domain of kernel located in the vicinity of the sink area might be truncated and causes an error in the particle approximations the clumping was also observed in the method mrpr to a smaller extent especially when implementing mrpr k because particles mass were set to their initial value when a particle was removed the stability of the simulations and the qualitative and quantitative results show the capability of the sink algorithms to reproducing fresh water pumping in aquifers 4 conclusion application of sph schemes to multi fluid flows in porous media with different porosities are not very common in this paper an eisph numerical scheme was used to investigate its applicability to seawater intrusion problems the focus was on the dynamics of buoyant freshwater lenses in islands and salt water upconing caused by pumping the model was tested against published results from laboratory experimental and models in the case of the freshwater lens the transient thickness and maximum depth of the simulated lens were in reasonable agreement with experimental data the simulated maximum depth of the lens as a function of different recharge rates were in agreement with observed analytical and other numerical results the imposition of flow boundary conditions to simulate recharge still represents a challenge in sph the lens dimensions obtained with eisph depended on the thickness of the inflow zone as this controlled the value of hydrostatic pressure acting on the surface of the island this depths was thus calibrated to best reproduce experimental data the inclusion of pumping was the main challenge to model salt water upconing a new procedure for implementing a sink in sph was developed the divergence of the velocity for the particles in the vicinity of the sink point was adjusted in accordance with the pumping rate to make the particles move toward the sink the extraction of mass was handled using three different methods indicated as spr mrpr and cmr spr where the mass reduction is handled solely through removal of particles appeared to perform better when compared to experimental observations the quantitative results of the cases studied here show the effectiveness of eisph in simulating complex flow conditions and lay the foundation for the inclusion of mass sinks in sph numerical schemes applied to water pumping although applied to 2d configurations the algorithm developed is also applicable to 3d problems to preserve reasonable computational times future avenues to improve the method point toward the extension of the model to radial coordinates or perhaps the development of ad hoc changes of the values of permeability and porosity to generate 2d domains equivalent to 3d axisymmetric problems e g langevin et al 2008 declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements the authors thank v lemiale and a valizadeh for useful discussions appendix a eisph scheme this section presents a detail description of the numerical method used to solve eqs 1 3 with sph the numerical scheme selected is eisph which has been shown to be computationally efficient and have lower pressure fluctuations when compared to other sph schemes nomeritae et al 2016 parts of the method are also described in basser et al 2017 the governing equations were solved with an eisph scheme which employs two steps cummins and rudman 1999 the poisson equation is approximately solved in the first step viscous gravity and drag forces contribute to the velocity and position of particles as 17 u i u i n μ ρ 2 u i n δ t i n g μ ρ κ u i n δ t where u is intermediate velocity u n is particle velocity at time n δ t with δ t kept constant in all the simulations the approximation of the viscous term reads 18 μ ρ 2 u i n j 1 n 4 m j n μ i μ j u ij n x ij n j n ρ i n ρ j n 2 x ij n 2 η 2 i w ij n where η is a small parameter included to make sure the denominator is non zero η 0 001 h ij with h ij h i h j 2 and u ij n u i n u j n the gravitational acceleration and the drag term are explicitly calculated the intermediate particle positions x are calculated as 19 x i x i n u i n δ t where x n is particle position at time n δ t afterwards the intermediate porosity of particles are assigned using the intermediate position of particles in the second step the particle velocities are calculated at the new time step as 20 u i n 1 u i i ρ i n p i n 1 δ t where p n 1 is particle pressure at time n 1 δ t eqs 20 and 1 are combined to form the pressure poisson equation as 21 ρ n p n 1 i u γ δ t i where γ is the contribution of the sink points around particle i see section 2 3 the approximation of the divergence of the intermediate velocity reads 22 u i j 1 n m j n j ρ j n u j u i i w ij the left hand side of eq 21 is a laplacian operator and is approximated as 23 ρ n p n 1 i j 1 n m j n j ρ i n ρ j n i j x ij i w ij x ij 2 η 2 p i n 1 p

as well as other applications nomeritae et al 2016 nomeritae et al 2018 it is assumed that the value of p j n 1 on the right hand side of eq 25 is equal to p j n this is a reasonable assumption as the time step is set to a sufficiently small value in addition the pressure field in the cases studied here does not change considerably the pressure of each particle is thus approximated explicitly as 28 p i n 1 b i j 1 n a ij p j n j 1 n a ij the pressure of free surface particles are set to zero the calculated pressure values are used to calculate the pressure gradient as 29 ρ n p n 1 i i j 1 n m j

new particle porosity n 1 is assigned the particle concentration is calculated using eq 3 as 31 c i n 1 c i n d d n 1 c i δ t where the effective dispersion matrix d d is determined as salamon et al 2006 and avesani et al 2015 32 d di n 1 d ei n 1 i d ti u i n 1 i d li d ti u i n 1 u i n 1 t u i n 1 where d l and d t are longitudinal and transversal dispersivity i is identity matrix of size 2 and d e is effective diffusivity coefficient in a saturated porous medium d e can be written as simunek and suarez 1993 33 d ei n 1 d mi i n 1 4 3 where d m is the coefficient of molecular diffusivity d d in eq 32 is a non diagonal matrix leading to complications with the sph approximation tran duc et al 2016 to simplify the approximation procedure d d is reasonably assumed to be a diagonal matrix the contribution of terms associated with non diagonal elements of the dispersion matrix in eq 32 were checked in one time step and was found to be nearly three times smaller than the contribution of the diagonal elements in the cases studied here the variation of concentration is approximated as tran duc et al 2016 34 d d n 1 c i 2 j 1 n m j n j n 1 ρ j n e ij 1 2 d d ij 11 n 1 e ij 2 2 d d ij 22 n 1 1 x ij n 1 i w ij x ij n 1 2 η 2 c i n c j n where e ij x ij x ij is the unit vector from i to j and d d ij is the average of the elements in the effective dispersion matrices of particles i and j afterwards the particles density and mass are calculated as pahar and dhar 2016 35 ρ i n 1 c i n 1 ρ s ρ f 0 5 ρ s ρ f 36 m i n 1 ρ i n 1 v pi n 1 where v p is volume of fluid a particle carries and is equal to v p m j ρ j the time step value δ t is defined to satisfy the courant stability and viscous diffusion conditions as 37 δ t min δ t cfl δ t visc with 38 δ t cfl 0 25 h u max and 39 δ t visc

6299,seawater intrusion modelling is often used to assist with groundwater management in coastal areas and islands although smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph schemes are able to simulate multi fluid flows in porous media they have not been widely tested against experimental observations yet additionally numerical methods for groundwater flow problems need to be able to simulate pumping which is an unexplored area in sph in this study an explicit incompressible sph eisph solver for multi fluid flow in porous media is used to simulate the dynamics of freshwater lenses in small islands and is further developed to simulate groundwater pumping and associated seawater upconing three methods to implement a sink term that models water pumping from an aquifer are proposed and compared the model is successfully tested against data from published laboratory scale experiments and other numerical models the results of eisph are comparable to other models the inclusion of a sink for water particles to simulate pumping did not affect the stability of the simulations although one of the three methods led to results that better compared to experimental data hence sph modelling of groundwater flows in porous media can be successfully achieved using the methods developed here keywords smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph explicit incompressible sph eisph freshwater lens upconing pumping porous media sink 1 introduction seawater intrusion in groundwater aquifers is a global issue that threatens availability of potable freshwater in coastal zones a naturally occurring process seawater intrusion is often enhanced by changes in fresh groundwater levels caused by pumping through extraction wells and land use change werner et al 2013 the change in groundwater levels causes reductions in the pressure exerted by overlying freshwater columns leading to upward intrusion of underlying seawater bertorelle 2014 the intrusion reduces freshwater storage volume and might contaminate freshwater extraction wells werner et al 2013 seawater intrusion is also of great importance in oceanic islands where fresh groundwater is often the only potable water source stoeckl and houben 2012 in oceanic islands fresh groundwater often floats over underlying seawater due to the density difference this floating body of freshwater is called a lens stoeckl and houben 2012 stoeckl et al 2016 freshwater lenses in oceanic islands often have limited thickness and are separated from the underlying seawater by a mixing zone dynamics of the mixing zone at the interface between freshwater and seawater are governed by a density dependent multi fluid flow werner et al 2017 factors associated with changes in rainfall regimes and excessive pumping of freshwater can reduce the thickness of these lenses as well as increase the possibility of seawater intrusion to extraction wells stoeckl and houben 2012 werner et al 2017 to investigate the process of seawater intrusion and understand the vulnerability of fresh groundwater aquifers numerous methods such as field monitoring techniques analytical studies and numerical models have been developed werner et al 2013 field techniques such as direct sampling and remote sensing white 1996 are used as the basis for empirical equations werner et al 2017 analytical solutions have been developed to predict the position of an interface between freshwater and seawater these methods mostly assume a sharp interface between two immiscible fluids and are derived for simplified steady state conditions in homogeneous aquifers vacher 1988 fetter 1972 dagan and bear 1968 numerical methods have been developed to overcome the limitations of analytical solutions and are able to model transient development of the interface of miscible fluids in aquifers with spatial hydraulic heterogeneity numerical models mostly solve a variable density multi fluid flow coupled with a solute transport equation werner et al 2013 the most commonly used codes are sutra voss et al 2002 and seawat langevin et al 2008 which solve the equations using finite elements and finite differences respectively readers are referred to werner et al 2013 2017 for a comprehensive review of common analytical and numerical studies recently particle methods such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph have been used to simulate multi fluid flow in porous media with applications to lock exchange basser et al 2017 pahar and dhar 2017 particle methods have been shown to have performance similar to conventional mesh based methods with the advantage to reduce numerical diffusivity herrera et al 2009 the modelling of anisotropic dispersion of solutes is one of the challenges faced by sph schemes with effort being dedicated to the reduction of the occurrence of negative concentrations avesani et al 2015 2017 however the use of sph schemes for the modelling of solute dispersion against experimental data are still rare further quantitative studies with applications to engineering problems are required to test the capability of sph to simulate multi fluid flow in porous media specifically the simulation of problems including pumping from wells requires modelling a mass sink one of the challenges associated with simulating a mass sink is tracking the particles around the sink point to ensure a well organised distribution of the particles to ensure an accurate sph approximation another challenge is defining how to remove mass associated with the extracted freshwater the aim of this study is thus to investigate the applicability of an sph scheme explicit incompressible sph eisph basser et al 2017 to simulate freshwater lens formations in islands and sea water upconing due to pumping an algorithm to simulate point mass sinks was developed and is presented here with applicability to water pumping 2 methods 2 1 governing equations the 2d governing equations for a flow of two or more incompressible fluids in saturated porous media at the darcy s scale with mass sinks and solute transport are basser et al 2017 bear and bachmat 2012 1 u γ 2 d u dt ρ p μ ρ 2 u g r 3 dc dt d d c where eqs 1 3 define mass

is the effective dispersion matrix of size 2 for the scalar see appendix a 2 2 sph approximation in sph the fluid domain is represented as an ensemble of lagrangian particles the values of variables associated with each particle are estimated using neighbouring particles readers are referred to monaghan 1992 1994 2012 for a general description of the particle approximation only key features of the model used in this study are presented here the spatial volume v of particles in porous media with spatially varying porosity is determined in accordance with the porosity of the media such that when a particle moves into a medium with lower porosity the same amount of mass occupies a larger volume i e v i m i i ρ i where m is the fluid mass of the particle and i refers to the i th particle basser et al 2017 pahar and dhar 2016 the particle approximation of the governing equations reads monaghan 2005 tran duc et al 2016 basser et al 2017 4 u i j 1 n m j j ρ j u j u i i w ij γ i 5 d u i

average of the effective dispersion matrices of particles i and j the numbers in subscript of e ij and d dij reference a particular element in the vector and the matrix respectively eq 6 equals zero where there is no porous medium the eisph method was used to solve eqs 1 3 nomeritae et al 2016 a detailed description of the numerical scheme used here is presented in appendix a 2 3 modelling a point sink to carry out sph simulations of problems including water extraction through wells a method to describe a sink for the extraction of water mass must be developed in a point sink such as suction or pumping acting at a point the fluid surrounding the sink point moves toward the sink point in sph this means that fluid particles should move toward the sink point and a portion of the fluid s mass should be removed at a rate equal to the sink rate the extraction of the mass from a point is included in eq 1 bear and bachmat 2012 in the form of fluid flux per unit of volume γ and is approximated as 8 γ k 1 s q k δ x x k where k is the k th sink point s denotes the number of sink points q is the sink rate and δ is the dirac function eq 8 describes fluid flux per unit volume due to sinks the contributions of sinks for particle i is approximated as 9 γ i k 1 s q k δ x i x k k 1 s q k ζ k w ik where ζ is a normalization factor equivalent to an approximation of constant 1 and defined as monaghan 2005 monaghan et al 2005 10 1 ζ k j 1 n m j j ρ j w jk in eq 9 sink points within a distance equal to the radius of the support of the kernel function from particle i are used to calculate γ therefore a sink point directly affects the particles sink particles hereafter within a distance equal to the radius of the support domain of the kernel function from the sink point the particles outside the direct influence of the sink point are indirectly affected through their interaction with the sink particles the term γ contributes to the pressure poisson equation eq 21 causing the pressure of the particles surrounding the sink point to change in a way that they move towards the sink point each particle in sph carries a certain amount of fluid mass and in order to account for the mass extraction due to the sink it is unavoidable to reduce the particles mass and delete particles where and when necessary three different methods for deleting particles are proposed to investigate their advantages and disadvantages 2 3 1 solely particle removal spr in this method the mass reduction due to the sink is handled by just deleting particles while maintaining the total particle mass constant in between deletion individual particle mass still needs to be updated due to changes in scalar concentration according to eq 7 one particle is deleted after a certain number of time steps the duration t p required to delete one particle is determined using the volume of fluid in a particle and the sink rate such that 11 t p v q where v is a spatial volume section 2 2 associated with a particle and v is the volume of fluid that each particle carries mass is reduced i e one particle is removed at every time step that is a multiple of t p i e at times t α t p α being an integer every time t α t p the particle closest to the sink point is removed fig 1 a because the sink particles move toward the sink point due to the inclusion of γ in the pressure poisson equation eq 21 the particle deletion does not lead to a void in the vicinity of the sink point 2 3 2 mass reduction and particle removal mrpr similar to spr one particle is removed every certain number of time steps however in contrast to spr the mass of sink particles is gradually reduced every time step before one particle is deleted the amount of mass reduction in one time step is divided among the sink particles and subtracted from each sink particle s mass the mass required to be removed is partitioned between sink particles in two ways 1 in accordance to the kernel value mrpr k so that the particles closer to a sink point lose more mass than the distant ones or 2 evenly mrpr e therefore the amount of mass extracted from each particle is determined using the sink rate time step value kernel value used in mrpr k and number of sink particles used in mrpr e when the time required to delete one particle α t p is reached the closest particle to the sink point is removed and the mass of the remaining sink particles is set back to their initial mass value fig 1b 2 3 3 constant mass reduction cmr in this method the mass of the sink particles is gradually reduced every time step as in mrpr e the reduction in mass of the sink particles continues until the mass of a sink particle drops below a cut off value which here is set to 1 of particles initial mass value at which time the particle is removed fig 1c the reduction of mass in accordance to the kernel value as in mrpr k was found problematic as continuous reduction of particles mass causes clumping of particles close to a sink point this is further explained in section 3 2 2 4 choice of kernel the selection of a kernel function and smoothing length in a problem in media with different porosities should be handled carefully the spatial volume that an sph particle occupies within a porous medium represents both fluid and solid phases volume therefore a fluid particle with a given mass within a porous medium has a larger spatial volume than a particle in a free flow domain with the same mass having a larger spatial volume causes the particles to move apart from each other leading to a loss of resolution inside the porous medium therefore the number of particles inside the support domain of the kernel function reduces and might not be sufficient to accurately approximate the variable values and derivatives to tackle this problem a kernel function with a larger support domain should be used or the smoothing length should be adjusted pahar and dhar 2016 the former approach might lead to an excessive smoothing of the variable values at the free flow domain furthermore using a larger support domain increases the number of interactions in the free flow domain leading to a higher computational cost here we use a variable smoothing length additional terms associated with the derivative of smoothing length are added to the momentum equation price and monaghan 2004 however these terms are neglected here a cubic spline weighting function liu and liu 2003 with a variable smoothing length was used here and is given by 12 w q h α d 2 3 q 2 1 2 q 3 0 q 1 1 6 2 q 3 1 q 2 0 q 2 where α d is a normalisation constant equal to 1 h 15 7 π h 2 or 3 2 π h 3 in one two and three dimensional domains respectively and q x i x j h x ij h in 2d we choose the smoothing length to be inversely proportional to the square root of porosity as 13 h i 1 2 δ x i where δ x is the average distance between fluid particles therefore in a medium with lower porosity the smoothing length is larger because the same value of smoothing length should be used for a pair of interacting particles to conserve momentum the smoothing length for interacting particles i and j is calculated as h ij h i h j 2 rafiee et al 2007 2 5 boundaries 2 5 1 solid boundaries a single layer of virtual particles is used to impose the impermeable boundaries at walls virtual particles interact with fluid particles and prevent them from penetrating the walls by exerting a lennard jones repulsive force given by monaghan 1994 14 f x ij v l r c x ij c 1 r c x ij c 2 1 x ij r c x ij 1 0 r c x ij 1 with c 1 and c 2 equal to 4 and 2 respectively v l is the square of the largest velocity in a flow and r c represents a cut off distance which is set to 0 8 times the initial distance between virtual particles the virtual particles are fixed in their position and never move the initial distance between the virtual particles is set to half the initial distance between the fluid particles to ensure the impermeability of the walls 2 5 2 free no slip boundaries ghost particles are used to impose free slip and no slip boundary conditions ghost particles are created by mirroring the fluid particles within a distance of 2 h from the solid boundaries liu and liu 2003 a ghost particle carries the same properties of the associated fluid particle to impose no slip boundary condition both components of velocity parallel and normal are reversed while for free slip conditions only the normal component is reversed marrone et al 2011 our investigations and previous studies e g nomeritae et al 2016 basser et al 2017 showed that ghost particles alone were not able to prevent particles from penetrating the solid walls therefore the ghost particles were used together with the virtual particles 2 5 3 inflow boundaries inflow particles are used to simulate inflow of fluid into the domain nomeritae et al 2018 the thickness of the zone occupied by inflow particles i e the inflow zone is set to be larger than the radius of the support domain of the kernel function inflow particles within the inflow zone are moved with a constant velocity determined by the inflow rate once an inflow particle moves outside the inflow zone it is turned into a fluid particle and moves according to the governing equations the inflow particles velocity and pressure are used in approximating the hydrodynamics of the fluid particles in a domain but not vice versa federico et al 2012 2 5 4 free surface boundaries a pressure p 0 is assigned to free surface particles the free surface particles are detected using fluid particles densities as in basser et al 2017 3 results the model is applied to two experimental studies to test different aspects of the method and validate it the experimental coastal freshwater lens in an isotropic porous medium studied in stoeckl and houben 2012 is simulated to check the capability of the model to reproduce the dynamics of fresh and salt water in a porous medium the experiment of salt water upconing induced by fresh water pumping studied in werner et al 2009 was simulated to validate the proposed sink algorithm and demonstrate the capability of the sph scheme to reproduce upconing of salt water in groundwater aquifers 3 1 laboratory scale coastal freshwater lens an experiment of formation of a coastal freshwater lens in a cone shape strip island was presented in stoeckl and houben 2012 in the experiment a cone shape submerged island 1 8 m long 0 3 m deep and 0 05 m wide was utilized fig 2 the porosity and mean hydraulic conductivity of the porous medium were given as 0 39 and k 4 5 10 3 m s 1 respectively the salt and fresh water densities were ρ s 1021 2 kg m 3 and ρ f 997 4 kg m 3 respectively initially the island was saturated up to y 0 3 m with salt water to represent the ocean freshwater was recharged with a rate equal to q 1 33 10 5 m s 1 through a set of drips above the sand cone the recharged fresh water penetrated into the porous medium i e island and formed a freshwater lens as shown in fig 2 as the experiment progressed an amount of freshwater discharged from the island to the surrounding salt water representing the ocean this water was skimmed from the salt water surface fig 2 to maintain a constant salt water level stoeckl and houben 2012 in the simulation a plane of symmetry was assumed requiring only half of the experimental domain to be simulated this is similar to the numerical study performed in stoeckl et al 2016 the left side of the island was simulated and a free slip boundary condition was used on the right wall of the domain to satisfy the symmetry of the flow the initial spacing between fluid particles δ x δ y was set to 0 005 m in the ocean and 0 005 m in the island the smoothing length h was set to 1 2 δ x with δ x varying in the ocean and island the time step was set to 2 10 4 s the dynamic viscosity for the fresh water was set to μ f 10 3 pa s and it was assumed to be μ s 1 05 10 3 pa s for the salt water isdale et al 1972 the calculated permeability was κ 4 6 10 10 m 2 using the properties of freshwater and hydraulic conductivity no slip boundary conditions were imposed on the left and bottom solid boundaries the longitudinal and transverse dispersivity included in eq 32 were set to d l 5 10 4 m and d t 5 10 5 m and the coefficient of molecular diffusivity was set to d m 10 9 m 2 s 1 stoeckl et al 2016 the freshwater recharge at the surface of the island was simulated using an inflow boundary condition section 2 5 3 the pressure within the inflow zone was set to be hydrostatic at every time step outside the island particles that moved above y 0 3 m were deleted to keep the water level constant and mimic the experimental procedure fig 3 shows the freshwater lens and the pressure distribution at different times the coarser resolution of particles in the porous medium is due to the definition of spatial volume that changes in accordance to porosity of the medium experimental or numerical pressure measurements are not available and a qualitative discussion is reported here the value of maximum pressure in the porous medium is higher than that of the free flow domain this is due to the extra pressure imposed by the inflow particles over the surface of the island it was found that changing the thickness of the inflow zone which changed the hydrostatic pressure at the surface of the island accordingly affected the maximum thickness of the lens predicted numerically our investigations showed that the thickness of the inflow zone should be equal to the radius of the support domain of the kernel function the definition of pressure at inflow boundary condition in sph is still an open issue with examples nomeritae et al 2018 showing the need to adjust the size of inflow zone to reproduce experimental data oscillations in pressure values occurred at the interface between the free flow domain and the porous medium fig 3 this might be due to the fact that for a support domain with its centre located right over the interface there are different numbers of particles within it from the two media our investigations showed that these oscillations do not significantly affect the numerical results it was found that with the proper boundary arrangements the transient formation as well as the maximum thickness of the lens were reasonably reproduced the numerical maximum thickness of the lens occurred close to the right boundary which is in agreement with the experimental and numerical results in stoeckl and houben 2012 and stoeckl et al 2016 the maximum depth predicted numerically was 16 cm and occurred in the middle of the island after 200 min this was close to the maximum thickness measured experimentally 15 cm that occurred at the same time it is observed in fig 3 that the density of salt water in the free flow domain at the interface between the free flow domain and the porous medium and close to the free surface is lower than the salt water density this was due to a horizontal flow within the lens from the symmetry boundary toward the left this was observed in the experiment stoeckl and houben 2012 and numerical benchmark by stoeckl et al 2016 it was also found that an amount of the discharged fresh water into the ocean moved back to the island and again converged with the horizontal flow of lens water into the salt water surface fig 3 t 200 min this represents the direction of the salt water flow from the free flow domain into the porous medium a similar flow direction was observed in the simulation of stoeckl et al 2016 it is observed that the thickness of the transition between freshwater and salt water is larger close to the symmetry boundary likely due to the higher vertical velocity of particles close to the symmetry boundary as the effective dispersion matrix is proportional to the velocity of particles the simulation was repeated for four other recharge rates and the maximum lens thickness was compared to numerical and analytical solutions stoeckl and houben 2012 fetter 1972 vacher 1988 to investigate the capability of the model to predict the maximum thickness as a function of recharge rate as observed in fig 4 a and b the eisph results are in good agreement with the numerical and analytical results the results show that the eisph can be used to well simulate applications associated with multi fluid flows in porous media 3 2 salt water upconing in a two dimensional aquifer a series of experiments of salt water upconing were presented in werner et al 2009 and their experiment 2 was used for comparison of the simulations here in the experiment a tank 1 18 m long 1 2 m deep and 0 053 m wide was used as shown in fig 5 four pipes fed freshwater and one pipe fed salt water to the tank from both sides the conductance i e resistance of the porous medium against the inflow was measured as m f 2 84 10 6 m 2 s 1 and m s 1 62 10 6 m 2 s 1 for the fresh water and salt water respectively jakovovic et al 2011 initially the tank was filled up to 0 15 m with salt water and 1 m depth of fresh water was filled over the salt water leading to an overall depth h b 1 15 m i e the fresh water head measured from the base of the tank fresh water was extracted using an extraction well with diameter equal to 0 012 m at the rate q p 7 10 5 m 2 s 1 the well was placed in the middle of the tank at a depth of 0 65 m from the top of the tank so that the distance between the well bottom to the initial interface of freshwater and salt water was 0 4 m jakovovic et al 2011 the freshwater inflow to the well occurred at the lower 0 1 m of it the porosity and hydraulic conductivity were given as 0 38 and k 1 6 10 3 m s 1 respectively the density of the salt and fresh water were ρ s 1025 kg m 3 and ρ f 998 kg m 3 respectively werner et al 2009 jakovovic et al 2011 two manometers were attached at the boundaries at both sides to measure any drawdown in the fresh water and salt water head as the freshwater and salt water head dropped at the boundaries an inflow was induced to feed the domain with both freshwater and salt water therefore the side boundaries acted as head dependent boundaries in the simulation the initial spacing between fluid particles δ x δ y was set to 0 005 m the smoothing length h was set to 1 2 δ x and the time step was 2 10 4 s the dynamic viscosity for the fresh water was set to μ f 10 3 pa s and it was assumed to be μ s 1 05 10 3 pa s for salt water isdale et al 1972 the calculated permeability was κ 1 67 10 10 m 2 using the parameters of salt water and hydraulic conductivity the lower section of the well dashed zone in fig 5 where freshwater was flowing into was treated as a high permeability section i e the drag force in eq 6 was set to zero and its length was assumed to be 0 05 m jakovovic et al 2011 the sink point location was set at the middle of the permeable zone a no slip boundary condition was imposed at the bottom solid boundary the coefficient of molecular diffusivity was set to d m 10 9 m 2 s 1 and the longitudinal and transverse dispersivity were set to d l 2 10 3 m and d t 1 10 4 m jakovovic et al 2011 the fresh water and salt water recharge were simulated using an inflow boundary condition section 2 5 3 with the rate of the inflow determined according to the boundaries time dependent head the inflow was simulated as a continuously distributed recharge rather than inflow nodes or pipes this was due to the nature of sph as a kernel close to the boundaries needs to be filled with particles to result in an accurate approximation the width of the inflow zones on the left and right boundaries were set to 0 04 m which was larger than the radius of the support of the kernel function the inflow rate for fresh water q f m s 1 and salt water q s m s 1 was calculated using the conductance initial boundary head h b and time dependent internal head at the boundaries h t as jakovovic et al 2011 15 q f m f h b h t h b 0 15 4 0 053 and 16 q s m s h b h t 0 15 0 053 where h t was assumed to be the average of the freshwater heads on the left and right boundaries to ensure a symmetrical inflow as it was observed in the experiment werner et al 2009 fig 6 shows the density distribution and transient development of the upconing below the extraction well using the method spr see section 2 3 in the early stages of the experiment werner et al 2009 a wave like interface rise was observed however this wasn t observed in our simulation this might be due to the continuously distributed inflow conditions on the sides of the tank because the wave like interface rise was due to the localised circulations induced by the node inflows in the experiment jakovovic et al 2011 the qualitative observation is in agreement with one of the simulations in jakovovic et al 2011 where a continuously distributed inflow was used the dispersion zone at the interface between fresh water and salt water especially in the later stages of the simulation was wider than the experimental dispersion zone our investigations showed that using a smaller values for longitudinal and transverse dispersivity did not considerably affect the dispersion zone width a thicker dispersion zone but with smaller extent was also observed in the simulations of jakovovic et al 2011 this thicker dispersion zone might be related to the assumption in the sph approximation of the diffusion equation see eqs 31 34 fig 7 a illustrates the upconing height as a function of time the numerical height of the upconing was determined based on the simulated 50 salinity contour jakovovic et al 2011 it was observed that the spr method led to results comparatively closer to the experimental observations fig 7b shows the error bar for the spr method the cmr method considerably overestimated the upconing heigh possibly because of the particle distribution pattern around the sink point fig 8 shows the particles around the sink point for the three sink methods the particles have an ordered distribution around the sink point in the spr while the particles are clumped for cmr method the clumping in cmr is due to the continuous reduction of mass for the sink particles until their mass drops to zero with the density of the particles around the sink point staying constant the reduction in mass causes the particles to get closer to the sink point therefore any support domain of kernel located in the vicinity of the sink area might be truncated and causes an error in the particle approximations the clumping was also observed in the method mrpr to a smaller extent especially when implementing mrpr k because particles mass were set to their initial value when a particle was removed the stability of the simulations and the qualitative and quantitative results show the capability of the sink algorithms to reproducing fresh water pumping in aquifers 4 conclusion application of sph schemes to multi fluid flows in porous media with different porosities are not very common in this paper an eisph numerical scheme was used to investigate its applicability to seawater intrusion problems the focus was on the dynamics of buoyant freshwater lenses in islands and salt water upconing caused by pumping the model was tested against published results from laboratory experimental and models in the case of the freshwater lens the transient thickness and maximum depth of the simulated lens were in reasonable agreement with experimental data the simulated maximum depth of the lens as a function of different recharge rates were in agreement with observed analytical and other numerical results the imposition of flow boundary conditions to simulate recharge still represents a challenge in sph the lens dimensions obtained with eisph depended on the thickness of the inflow zone as this controlled the value of hydrostatic pressure acting on the surface of the island this depths was thus calibrated to best reproduce experimental data the inclusion of pumping was the main challenge to model salt water upconing a new procedure for implementing a sink in sph was developed the divergence of the velocity for the particles in the vicinity of the sink point was adjusted in accordance with the pumping rate to make the particles move toward the sink the extraction of mass was handled using three different methods indicated as spr mrpr and cmr spr where the mass reduction is handled solely through removal of particles appeared to perform better when compared to experimental observations the quantitative results of the cases studied here show the effectiveness of eisph in simulating complex flow conditions and lay the foundation for the inclusion of mass sinks in sph numerical schemes applied to water pumping although applied to 2d configurations the algorithm developed is also applicable to 3d problems to preserve reasonable computational times future avenues to improve the method point toward the extension of the model to radial coordinates or perhaps the development of ad hoc changes of the values of permeability and porosity to generate 2d domains equivalent to 3d axisymmetric problems e g langevin et al 2008 declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements the authors thank v lemiale and a valizadeh for useful discussions appendix a eisph scheme this section presents a detail description of the numerical method used to solve eqs 1 3 with sph the numerical scheme selected is eisph which has been shown to be computationally efficient and have lower pressure fluctuations when compared to other sph schemes nomeritae et al 2016 parts of the method are also described in basser et al 2017 the governing equations were solved with an eisph scheme which employs two steps cummins and rudman 1999 the poisson equation is approximately solved in the first step viscous gravity and drag forces contribute to the velocity and position of particles as 17 u i u i n μ ρ 2 u i n δ t i n g μ ρ κ u i n δ t where u is intermediate velocity u n is particle velocity at time n δ t with δ t kept constant in all the simulations the approximation of the viscous term reads 18 μ ρ 2 u i n j 1 n 4 m j n μ i μ j u ij n x ij n j n ρ i n ρ j n 2 x ij n 2 η 2 i w ij n where η is a small parameter included to make sure the denominator is non zero η 0 001 h ij with h ij h i h j 2 and u ij n u i n u j n the gravitational acceleration and the drag term are explicitly calculated the intermediate particle positions x are calculated as 19 x i x i n u i n δ t where x n is particle position at time n δ t afterwards the intermediate porosity of particles are assigned using the intermediate position of particles in the second step the particle velocities are calculated at the new time step as 20 u i n 1 u i i ρ i n p i n 1 δ t where p n 1 is particle pressure at time n 1 δ t eqs 20 and 1 are combined to form the pressure poisson equation as 21 ρ n p n 1 i u γ δ t i where γ is the contribution of the sink points around particle i see section 2 3 the approximation of the divergence of the intermediate velocity reads 22 u i j 1 n m j n j ρ j n u j u i i w ij the left hand side of eq 21 is a laplacian operator and is approximated as 23 ρ n p n 1 i j 1 n m j n j ρ i n ρ j n i j x ij i w ij x ij 2 η 2 p i n 1 p

n ρ j n i j x ij i w ij x ij 2 η 2 and 27 b i u γ δ t i eq 25 is explicitly solved with an approximation that has been proven to lead to satisfactory results in flow in porous media basser et al 2017 as well as other applications nomeritae et al 2016 nomeritae et al 2018 it is assumed that the value of p j n 1 on the right hand side of eq 25 is equal to p j n this is a reasonable assumption as the time step is set to a sufficiently small value in addition the pressure field in the cases studied here does not change considerably the pressure of each particle is thus approximated explicitly as 28 p i n 1 b i j 1 n a ij p j n j 1 n a ij the pressure of free surface particles are set to zero the calculated pressure values are used to calculate the pressure gradient as 29 ρ n p n 1 i i j 1 n m j n j p i n 1 ρ i n 2 p j n 1 ρ j n 2 i w ij afterwards the velocity field at the new time step is calculated using eq 20 the new position is calculated as 30 x i n 1 x i n u i n i n u i n 1 i 2 δ t and new particle porosity n 1 is assigned the particle concentration is calculated using eq 3 as 31 c i n 1 c i n d d n 1 c i δ t where the effective dispersion matrix d d is determined as salamon et al 2006 and avesani et al 2015 32 d di n 1 d ei n 1 i d ti u i n 1 i d li d ti u i n 1 u i n 1 t u i n 1 where d l and d t are longitudinal and transversal dispersivity i is identity matrix of size 2 and d e is effective diffusivity coefficient in a saturated porous medium d e can be written as simunek and suarez 1993 33 d ei n 1 d mi i n 1 4 3 where d m is the coefficient of molecular diffusivity d d in eq 32 is a non diagonal matrix leading to complications with the sph approximation tran duc et al 2016 to simplify the approximation procedure d d is reasonably assumed to be a diagonal matrix the contribution of terms associated with non diagonal elements of the dispersion matrix in eq 32 were checked in one time step and was found to be nearly three times smaller than the contribution of the diagonal elements in the cases studied here the variation of concentration is approximated as tran duc et al 2016 34 d d n 1 c i 2 j 1 n m j n j n 1 ρ j n e ij 1 2 d d ij 11 n 1 e ij 2 2 d d ij 22 n 1 1 x ij n 1 i w ij x ij n 1 2 η 2 c i n c j n where e ij x ij x ij is the unit vector from i to j and d d ij is the average of the elements in the effective dispersion matrices of particles i and j afterwards the particles density and mass are calculated as pahar and dhar 2016 35 ρ i n 1 c i n 1 ρ s ρ f 0 5 ρ s ρ f 36 m i n 1 ρ i n 1 v pi n 1 where v p is volume of fluid a particle carries and is equal to v p m j ρ j the time step value δ t is defined to satisfy the courant stability and viscous diffusion conditions as 37 δ t min δ t cfl δ t visc with 38 δ t cfl 0 25 h u max and 39 δ t visc 0 125 h 2 ν where ν is the kinematic viscosity and u max is the maximum velocity predicted in the computations morris et al 1997
