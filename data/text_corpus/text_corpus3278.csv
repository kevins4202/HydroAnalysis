resistance and are untreatable with routine antibiotics both governments and academia are devoting their efforts to tackling these challenging issues to secure human health from the battlefield against superbugs ninety three out of 194 world health organization who members including the united states us european union eu and hong kong hk have issued action plans to incorporate joint efforts both locally and globally to contain the growing threats of antibiotic resistance eu 2017 hk 2017 us 2015 under the framework of the one health concept antibiotic resistance is not limited to nosocomial settings and environmental surveillance is also needed the frontier report of the united nations environment programme in 2017 highlighted antimicrobial resistance as one of the top emerging environmental concerns unep 2017 surveillance studies have been conducted across various environment ecotypes including soil forsberg et al 2014 river wu et al 2019 drinking water ma et al 2019 etc wwtps have been reported as the hotspots of args che et al 2019 ju et al 2019 karkman et al 2017 subirats et al 2019 in which bacteria from human intestines and the environment are mixed in a high density residual bacteria and args in discharging effluents can spread to nearby and downstream environments corno et al 2019 quintela baluja et al 2019 subirats et al 2019 mobile genetic elements mges accelerate the horizontal transfer of args across the taxonomy boundaries including the transfer from pathogenic bacteria to a broad range of taxa li et al 2020 to adequately address arg issues in wwtps efforts are needed to synchronously detect resistome and mges along the whole treatment process global monitoring of untreated wastewater has been conducted before revealing the joint effects of social economic and environmental factors shaping arg abundance hendriksen et al 2019 treated wastewater i e effluent is also essential to be globally surveyed regarding its direct influence on the downstream receiving environment and its function as an indicator of the operational performance of a wwtp previous reports showed that the removal efficiencies of args varied among different wwtps cacace et al 2019 a worldwide scale study will help obtain a broad picture of the magnitude of severity on arg issues and the diversity of the situations however there is a lack of parallel comparison among resistome in effluents on a global scale a regional study on wwtp effluents has been conducted in 10 european cities by quantifying 9 args using real time quantitative pcr cacace et al 2019 in addition 285 args in wwtp effluent from six cities located from middle to southern china were studied using high throughput quantitative pcr an et al 2018 both studies are regional with incomplete reflection on differences around the world and the methods have limitations regarding the detected genotypes due to biases in the design of primers used in pcr indeed next generation sequencing technology has been widely applied in recent years with strengths in a high throughput collection of genes and broad coverage of microbes based on high throughput sequencing metagenomic analysis is competent in characterizing the contrasting abundance and diversity of both resistome and mobilome in effluents on a broad geographical scale what should be kept in mind is that this advanced high throughput sequencing technology has its limitation in distinguishing the viable and non viable resistant bacteria culture based methods could be used for viable resistance bacteria but only workable for a limited number of bacteria thus more improvements of technologies are expected in the future moreover public platforms of arg surveillance data lack information on wwtp effluents resistancebank org van boeckel et al 2019 and resistancemap the center for disease dynamics 2021 are available platforms that share information on animal antimicrobial resistance and resistant isolates across the world respectively args osp collects the abundance and diversity profile of args in the environmental dimension but only covers a few effluent samples in china zhang et al 2020 in alignment with the growing concerns on arg management the assessment on wwtps performance in removing args reinforces the need for an easily accessible repository of resistome data for both government stewardship and academic reference in the background of an explosively increasing amount of metagenomic datasets in the present study we characterized the resistome and mobilome in three hk wwtps and other wwtps across the world for the purpose of guiding risk control we looked holistically at the abundance and diversity of resistome their spatial variance and changes along the whole process of wwtps we aimed to examine the removal efficiency of resistome across different wwtps and decipher the contributing factors moreover we applied an exposure ranking approach to explore resistome with high mobility and pathogenicity 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and sequencing influent activated sludge as and effluent samples were collected from three local municipal wwtps in hk shatin wwtp st treats 250 000 m3 of wastewater from over 600 000 citizens per day using activated sludge shek wu hui wwtp swh treats 81 000 m3 per day from adjacent districts with over 300 000 citizens using activated sludge stanley wwtp sl serves a population of over 27 000 which produces around 8800 m3 wastewater per day and adopts the moving bed biofilm treatment technology from jan 2018 to feb 2019 a monthly sampling campaign was organized to take samples from the influent activated sludge mixed liquor and effluent of the final sedimentation tank from these three wwtps samples were mixed with absolute ethanol of the same volume for dna fixation sent back to the lab immediately and treated following the same procedures 1 pretreatment 300 ml influent sample was centrifuged at 4750

activated sludge sample was centrifuged at 15 000 x g for 3 min beckman coulter microfuge 20r then the pellet was kept 5 l effluent sample was filtered using cellulose acetate membrane pore size 0 45 μm and the membrane was kept 2 extraction of dna using fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals 3 metagenomic sequencing by sending dna extract to a commercial lab novegene for sequencing by illumina x ten with pe150 2 2 collection of worldwide datasets of wwtps studies or projects with metagenomic datasets on wwtps were searched from public repositories including ncbi https www ncbi nlm nih gov mg rast https www mg rast org and ena https www ebi ac uk ena browser home only metagenomic datasets of on site samples from municipal wwtps obtained using shotgun metagenomic sequencing on the illumina platform were selected for further analysis the collected datasets were further grouped into influent activated sludge and effluents to compare arg profiles of different counterparts in the wwtps of this study for the effluent samples studied in the present study the detailed information of datasets and operational information of the wwtps was summarized in table s4 2 3 quantification of args mges and bacteria metagenomic datasets generated in this study and the downloaded datasets were firstly adapter clipped and quality trimmed using trimmomatic quality cut off 20 bolger et al 2014 next args from each metagenome were identified by aligning against a structured database sarg v2 2 and quantified into the unit of copies of args per cell using args oap v2 2 yin et al 2018 cell numbers were quantified in each dataset by mapping against the database of essential single copy marker genes for bacteria and archaea nayfach and pollard 2015 args were classified into 24 types which stands for the type of antibiotic against which the genes conferring resistance and 1204 subtypes representing the genotypes with a collection of highly similar reference variants the total number of reference gene sequences deposited in sarg v2 2 is 10 208 metagenomic datasets were also passed through mge analysis by aligning against a published mges reference database parnanen et al 2018 and quantified into the unit of copies of mges per cell using args oap v2 2 the reference database includes transposes integrases plasmid tn916 and other important mges to quantify the bacterial community in different taxonomic levels kraken2 v2 0 8 wood and salzberg 2014 was applied to classify clean reads by referring to the k mer index generated from gtdb complete genome database release 89 parks et al 2020 the classification results were summarized in relative quantification of each taxon by bracken 2 0 lu et al 2017 2 4 absolute quantification based on mass conservation to discuss arg variation in temporal scale we adopted a method inspired by jiang et al 2017 which took bacterial dna mass density distinction in different steps of wwtp systems into consideration for absolute quantification the calculation was based on the mass conservation between extracted dna and sequenced dna under the assumption that dna extraction efficiency is 100 then the following equation was adopted to quantify args and mges in influents effluents and as in the three wwtps in the unit of the copies of args per ml 1 q arg abundanc e arg n cell v 60 μ l c dna 10 9 m dna where the qarg represents the arg concentration in the unit of copies of arg per ml abundancearg represents the args quantification result of args oap in the unit of copies of arg per cell ncell represents the cell number in the

extracted dna using fastdna spin kit for soil cdna is the concentration of extracted dna ng μl the mdna stands for the equivalent weight gram as double strand dna of the sequenced reads which could be calculated using equation 2 2 m dna an x 313 2 tn x 304 2 cn x 289 2 gn x 329 2 6 02 10 23 2 where an tn cn and gn represent the count of each type of nucleotide in the whole datasets respectively the detection limit of this method could be calculated by assuming that there is only 1 recalled args like read in the metagenomic sequence dataset 2 5 measurement of antibiotics grab samples from as of three wwtps were transported to the laboratory and were immediately centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min at 4 beckman coulter avanti j 15r supernatants remained and were further filtered through a 0 2 μm cellulose nitrate membrane the filtrate went through solid phase extraction spe using oasis hlb cartridge to extract antibiotics and antibiotics were detected by acquity uplc ms ms following the reported procedure li et al 2009 2 6 source tracking and correlation analysis source tracking of args in effluents was conducted in r studio using sourcetracker under default parameter settings in which different categorical probabilities were used for calling a specific ratio of source present knights et al 2011 for each sample predicted proportions for influents and as across three runs were averaged and standard deviation sd and relative sd rsd were calculated across the predicted proportions principal coordinates analysis pcoa was conducted on all samples with arg abundance at the subtype level using bray curtis distance and r packages vegan jari oksanen et al 2019 biodiversityr kindt 2016 and plotly carson sievert et al 2019 for the structural equation model sem antibiotic concentration was an independent variable while the bacterial and mge abundances were two intermediate variables and the arg abundance was a response variable then hellinger transformation was conducted on these variables and a matrix of the pairwise correlations was generated between variables from a mantel test conducted using the vegan package jari oksanen et al 2019 sem was constructed using the package lavaan rosseel et al 2019 a maximum likelihood estimation method was used to estimate model parameters the following fit statistics examined the best fit model chi square χ2 0 05 the goodness of fit gfi 0 95 normed fit index nfi 0 95 and root mean square error of approximation rmsea 0 008 hu et al 2016 wang et al 2019 3 results 3 1 exposure ranking of global wide effluents arg and mge abundance in effluents from three hk wwtps and countries of other continents were quantified following the same analytical procedure these samples were significantly different according to the overall arg abundance and could be grouped into four ranking levels which are level 1 1 level 2 0 5 1 level 3 0 25 0 5 and level 4 0 25 in the unit of copies of args per cell indicated by mann whitney test p value 0 001 table s1 clearly the resistome in hk wwtp effluent were in level 2 or level 3 although they varied over time fig 1 d some wwtps from singapore and switzerland managed to discharge the effluents with the lowest level level 4 while some other wwtps from switzerland together with wwtps from peru had the highest arg abundance level level 1 moreover the global average abundance of args was 0 5 copy of arg per cell although datasets were derived from various studies there was no significant study effect on deciphering the arg profiles fig s1 by quantifying the total mge abundances the abundance of mobilome of effluents in hk ranged from 1 36 to 4 11 copies of mges per cell which was moderately abundant compared with counterparts in wwtps from other locations since mge themselves are not regarded as pollutants but contributors to the dissemination of args we did not conduct exposure ranking on mobilome profile nevertheless the quantification of the broad spectrum of mges covering transposases insertion elements integrons integrative and conjugative elements and plasmids helps to understand the dissemination possibility of args which is explicitly included in the list of factors possessing higher health risk of specific samples 3 2 local temporal variations in effluents influents and as in absolute quantification in hk the differences of arg and mge abundance and diversity among three wwtps were compared over 13 months an absolute quantification method in the unit of the copy of arg per ml was applied results showed that the overall concentrations of args were 9 11 4 20 105 copies ml 5 88 2 28 105 copies ml and 9 14 7 54 105 copiesml in st stl and swh effluents respectively while the mges were quantified to be 4 39 2 23 106 copies ml 2 90 0 58 106 copies ml and 4 68 3 59 106 copies ml in the corresponding wwtps fig 2 a fig s4 in st the overall concentration of args in effluents varied over time in a stochastic pattern however the quinolone resistant genes clearly emerged to be among the top abundant arg types after july 2018 maybe due to the sewage bringing the increased amount of quinolone resistant bacteria into wwtps in stl effluent the temporal variation of total arg concentration was moderate compared with others whereas the concentration of sulfonamide resistant genes occasionally increased in may july partially due to the relevant increase in stl as in swh there was a sharp increase of the overall arg concentration in december 2018 probably due to a surge of biomass in the effluent since there were merely slight changes in the proportion of arg types fig 2a and the overall abundance fig s3 additionally for st and stl the most abundant arg type shifted over sampling time from multidrug to beta lactam and sulfonamide resistance genes whereas in swh multidrug resistant genes were constantly the most abundant arg types in the 13 months there were no significant seasonal changes in the studied period among the 814 detected args reference sequence level and 248 detected mges only limited numbers of args and mges were studied in absolute quantification in previous studies summarized in fig 2b and table s2 results showed that the absolute quantification methods on metagenomics used in this study are comparable to prior studies based on qpcr methods in contrast to low throughput in previous qpcr studies a much broader spectrum of args and mobile genetic elements were detected in this study using the comprehensive databases of 1208 args genotypes and 280 mge reference genes 3 3 args were removed significantly by wwtps overall the removal efficiencies of args were 2 34 0 27 2 37 0 23 and 2 44 0 38 in the unit of log10 reduction for st stl and swh wwtps respectively however for the specific arg types the removal efficiencies were quite different fig 3 b vancomycin resistance genes were eliminated most efficiently in st wwtp and tetracycline and mls were with over 2 5 log reduction in both st and swh wwtps stl wwtp had the highest removal efficiency of polymyxin and kasugamycin resistance gene among the total 21 arg types detected in effluent samples of the three wwtps 16 were shown in fig 3 since the other 5 arg types including bleomycin carbomycin fosfomycin puromycin and tetracenomycin c were less than the average detection limits of the metagenomic approach used in the present study which were estimated to be 2 3 to 4 7 104 copies ml in the influents and 3 8 to 7 5 102 copies ml in the effluents there were shared arg subtypes among influent as and effluent fig 3a taking st wwtp as an example among the total 653 arg subtypes introduced by influent 215 were not detected anymore in all the effluent samples after treatment while 121 args were still found in all the effluent and 317 args were occasionally detected in different samples there were 24 args particularly found in effluent but not detected in the influent samples most likely because of the estimation bias due to the limited sequencing depth of these genes all these 24 args belonged to the five less abundant arg types mentioned above furthermore the core resistomes shared by the same sample type of three wwtps were shown in figure s5 3 4 arg variants with high risk in wwtp effluents hundreds of detected args in the environments were reported to pose health risks at different levels zhang et al 2021 the 8145 arg variants detected from the effluents in hk were categorized into five ranks rank i ii iii iv and unassessed according to their risk levels following the method published by zhang et al 2021 which ranks the risk of arg variants based on comprehensive data mining on anthropogenic prevalence the mobility of genes and the potential pathogenicity of the args carrying bacteria it was noteworthy that the total abundances of rank i args in st and stl were over the global average abundance fig 4 a although the total arg abundance of both st and stl were below the global average fig 1c indicting the potential higher risk of args in hk effluents as shown in fig 4b the average removal efficiency of rank i args was relatively lower than that of rank ii and rank iii in all the three wwtps in total 72 out of 122 rank i args were detected in hk effluents accounting for 3 86 2 39 1 49 0 35 and 1 01 0 28 of the total abundance in st stl and swh effluents respectively among these rank i args abe98197 a qnrs gene conferring quinolone resistance were detected in high abundance with 1 23 1 08 10 2 2 55 0 87 10 3 7 95 3 56 10 4 copy per cell in st stl and swh respectively remarkably abe98197 was among the 41 major arg variants in hk effluents 5 10 3 copy per cell in at least one out of 39 effluent samples in three wwtps figure s6 arousing the alarming concern on this gene 3 5 source tracking of effluents to manage the args in effluents a better understanding of the sources is required therefore a source tracking approach was used to decipher the relationship between influent as and effluent fig 5 a results showed the contribution ratios of as and influent were 60 x223c 80 and 20 30 of the total resistome in the effluent which delineated that as more than influents shaped arg abundance and structure in effluents this result was similar to the previous reports quintela baluja et al 2019 lee et al 2020 and indicated that the residual portion of resistome in effluents is more likely to be mediated by indigenous bacteria of as than by fecal microbial contamination in the influent 3 6 contributing factors to the resistomes of as a further analysis was conducted to decipher the direct and indirect contributing factors to the resistome of as and influent including antibiotic concentration bacterial communities and mges etc fig 5b sem analysis showed that as resistome was influenced by bacterial community and mge abundance the concentration of antibiotics was shown to be an insignificant factor shaping either arg abundances or mges abundances 4 discussion wwtps are critical points connecting urbanized citizens with the environment indeed as a component within the urban wastewater cycle wwtps are regarded as the very likely hotspot in which excreted and discarded antibiotics can induce the proliferation of args and antibiotic resistant bacteria discharged into wwtps from multiple sources influents of wwtps as the wastewater from the served community recapitulate 97 of human fecal microbial communities newton et al 2015 thus influents act as a proxy at the community level of the epidemiology of resistant pathogens within the catchment areas the microbes in as are a microbial community distinct from influents with over 700 bacteria genera in high biomass density generally 2 10 g l ju and zhang 2015 the discharged effluents shaped by both influents and as can impact the receiving environment in this study effluent resistome were comprehensively assessed from the perspective of risk evaluation a consecutive monthly sampling in 13 months was conducted in three hk wwtps providing valuable materials for exploring the dissemination and proliferation of args in the whole process of wwtps on a temporal scale the global profiles of arg abundance and diversity in the effluent of wwtps were investigated by collecting the publicly available datasets of wwtps with biological treatment in cities across north america chu et al 2018 south america pehrsson et al 2016 europe bengtsson palme et al 2016 ju et al 2019 and asia fresia et al 2019 results demonstrated significantly distinct resistome profiles in effluents across cities while slight differences among effluents in three hk wwtps the diverse abundances of args in the unit of copy per cell led to an exposure ranking scheme including level 1 2 3 and 4 for quantitative understanding of the exposure and informed management of resistome in effluents with a global baseline the different abundances of those geographically close locations indicated that climates or latitudes might not be the main shaping factors on args in effluents which was also mentioned in previous reports cacace et al 2019 zhu et al 2017 nevertheless the varied technologies applied in these wwtps table s4 and distinct characteristics of sewages in different cities may contribute to different levels of resistome in effluents for the convenience of research communication and government consultancy the exposure ranking scheme developed and the global resistome profile of wwtps analyzed in the present study were shared on a publicly available platform https smile hku hk resistancewwtps fig 6 parallel comparisons can be easily conducted to determine the exposure level of a sample or an area following the user friendly pipeline limitations are due to the restricted availability of metagenomic datasets in effluent samples inadequate sequencing depths and uneven geographical distribution of the collected data additionally the assumption of 100 dna extraction efficiency will underestimate the concentrations of args therefore it reinforces the need for the platform s development to expand the collection of representative samples across the world to further improve the exposure ranking scheme and correct dna extraction efficiency by using spiked positive controls to have a more accurate absolute quantification method the investigated hk wwtps had relatively high efficiency in eliminating args compared with the global average the raw wastewater in hk contained abundant args which was higher than the global average level fig 1b while after efficient treatment arg abundances in effluents of hk wwtps were lower than the global average fig 1c however there were still some concerns regarding resistome in the effluent of hk wwtp first the temporal variations of several important arg types including the quinolone resistance genes indicated the limited capability in dealing with the fluctuation of args in the influent second arg variants with high risk in rank i including abe98197 a qnrs gene were still highly abundant in effluents qnrs gene was associated with five nosocomial pathogens including mrsa vrefm esbl producing enterobacteriaceae carbapenem resistant enterobacteriaceae and carbapenem resistant a baumannii ho et al 2017 indeed our study based on the assembled contigs of the same samples showed 19 qnrs carrying enterobacterales genomes detected in effluents including e coli and klebsiella pneumonia these arg variants in effluent with the high mobility and the high pathogenicity potential of their hosts may cause arg dissemination in the receiving environments and the threats to the human health what needs to mention is that the detection of args by metagenomics does not mean the occurrence of viable resistant bacteria so the functional demonstrations and other traditional microbial approaches are still in their necessity to evaluate the risk of args in wwtp effluents comprehensively overall special attention is needed to advance the management strategy on these risky args and arb in the effluent 5 conclusions this study intensively sampled three wwtps in hk over 13 months and collected datasets from other cities worldwide to comprehensively assess the level of resistome in both spatial and temporal scales specifically hk effluents were ranked in level 2 and level 3 out of the ranking scheme based on the total arg abundances indicating moderate pollution of args in effluents of wwtps in hk moreover an absolute quantification approach was adopted to quantify temporal variations in the effluent resistome the disclosed distinct changes over time among different arg types indicate the requirement of a solution of real time management of wwtp systems arg variants of the highest risk rank i were present at a much higher abundance in the effluent of wwtps in hk compared with the global average level indicating the potential risk of args in hk effluent source tracking revealed that as contributed more than influent in shaping effluent resistome further sem analysis deduced that bacterial community and horizontal gene transfer activities were the primary factors that affect the as resistome while antibiotic concentrations were minor factors taken together the present study demonstrated an exposure assessment scheme regarding total arg abundance and risky arg variants in hk effluents although the wwtps functioned well in removing args with high efficiency the spatial and temporal variance still called for attention on resistome and mobilome risk

activated sludge sample was centrifuged at 15 000 x g for 3 min beckman coulter microfuge 20r then the pellet was kept 5 l effluent sample was filtered using cellulose acetate membrane pore size 0 45 μm and the membrane was kept 2 extraction of dna using fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals 3 metagenomic sequencing by sending dna extract to a commercial lab novegene for sequencing by illumina x ten with pe150 2 2 collection of worldwide datasets of wwtps studies or projects with metagenomic datasets on wwtps were searched from public repositories including ncbi https www ncbi nlm nih gov mg rast https www mg rast org and ena https www ebi ac uk ena browser home only metagenomic datasets of on site samples from municipal wwtps obtained using shotgun metagenomic sequencing on the illumina platform were selected for further analysis the collected datasets were further grouped into influent activated sludge and effluents to compare arg profiles of different counterparts in the wwtps of this study for the effluent samples studied in the present study the detailed information of datasets and operational information of the wwtps was summarized in table s4 2 3 quantification of args mges and bacteria metagenomic datasets generated in this study and the downloaded datasets were firstly adapter clipped and quality trimmed using trimmomatic quality cut off 20 bolger et al 2014 next args from each metagenome were identified by aligning against a structured database sarg v2 2 and quantified into the unit of copies of args per cell using args oap v2 2 yin et al 2018 cell numbers were quantified in each dataset by mapping against the database of essential single copy marker genes for bacteria and archaea nayfach and pollard 2015 args were classified into 24 types which stands for the type of antibiotic against which the genes conferring resistance and 1204 subtypes representing the genotypes with a collection of highly similar reference variants the total number of reference gene sequences deposited in sarg v2 2 is 10 208 metagenomic datasets were also passed through mge analysis by aligning against a published mges reference database parnanen et al 2018 and quantified into the unit of copies of mges per cell using args oap v2 2 the reference database includes transposes integrases plasmid tn916 and other important mges to quantify the bacterial community in different taxonomic levels kraken2 v2 0 8 wood and salzberg 2014 was applied to classify clean reads by referring to the k mer index generated from gtdb complete genome database release 89 parks et al 2020 the classification results were summarized in relative quantification of each taxon by bracken 2 0 lu et al 2017 2 4 absolute quantification based on mass conservation to discuss arg variation in temporal scale we adopted a method inspired by jiang et al 2017 which took bacterial dna mass density distinction in different steps of wwtp systems into consideration for absolute quantification the calculation was based on the mass conservation between extracted dna and sequenced dna under the assumption that dna extraction efficiency is 100 then the following equation was adopted to quantify args and mges in influents effluents and as in the three wwtps in the unit of the copies of args per ml 1 q arg abundanc e arg n cell v 60 μ l c dna 10 9 m dna where the qarg represents the arg concentration in the unit of copies of arg per ml abundancearg represents the args quantification result of args oap in the unit of copies of arg per cell ncell represents the cell number in the sequenced reads quantified by args oap on the alignment of essential single copy marker genes v represents the volume of sample used as input of dna extraction ml 60 μl is the elution volume of extracted dna using fastdna spin kit for soil cdna is the concentration of extracted dna ng μl the mdna stands for the equivalent weight gram as double strand dna of the sequenced reads which could be calculated using equation 2 2 m dna an x 313 2 tn x 304 2 cn x 289 2 gn x 329 2 6 02 10 23 2 where an tn cn and gn represent the count of each type of nucleotide in the whole datasets respectively the detection limit of this method could be calculated by assuming that there is only 1 recalled args like read in the metagenomic sequence dataset 2 5 measurement of antibiotics grab samples from as of three wwtps were transported to the laboratory and were immediately centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min at 4 beckman coulter avanti j 15r supernatants remained and were further filtered through a 0 2 μm cellulose nitrate membrane the filtrate went through solid phase extraction spe using oasis hlb cartridge to extract antibiotics and antibiotics were detected by acquity uplc ms ms following the reported procedure li et al 2009 2 6 source tracking and correlation analysis source tracking of args in effluents was conducted in r studio using sourcetracker under default parameter settings in which different categorical probabilities were used for calling a specific ratio of source present knights et al 2011 for each sample predicted proportions for influents and as across three runs were averaged and standard deviation sd and relative sd rsd were calculated across the predicted proportions principal coordinates analysis pcoa was conducted on all samples with arg abundance at the subtype level using bray curtis distance and r packages vegan jari oksanen et al 2019 biodiversityr kindt 2016 and plotly carson sievert et al 2019 for the structural equation model sem antibiotic concentration was an independent variable while the bacterial and mge abundances were two intermediate variables and the arg abundance was a response variable then hellinger transformation was conducted on these variables and a matrix of the pairwise correlations was generated between variables from a mantel test conducted using the vegan package jari oksanen et al 2019 sem was constructed using the package lavaan rosseel et al 2019 a maximum likelihood estimation method was used to estimate model parameters the following fit statistics examined the best fit model chi square χ2 0 05 the goodness of fit gfi 0 95 normed fit index nfi 0 95 and root mean square error of approximation rmsea 0 008 hu et al 2016 wang et al 2019 3 results 3 1 exposure ranking of global wide effluents arg and mge abundance in effluents from three hk wwtps and countries of other continents were quantified following the same analytical procedure these samples were significantly different according to the overall arg abundance and could be grouped into four ranking levels which are level 1 1 level 2 0 5 1 level 3 0 25 0 5 and level 4 0 25 in the unit of copies of args per cell indicated by mann whitney test p value 0 001 table s1 clearly the resistome in hk wwtp effluent were in level 2 or level 3 although they varied over time fig 1 d some wwtps from singapore and switzerland managed to discharge the effluents with the lowest level level 4 while some other wwtps from switzerland together with wwtps from peru had the highest arg abundance level level 1 moreover the global average abundance of args was 0 5 copy of arg per cell although datasets were derived from various studies there was no significant study effect on deciphering the arg profiles fig s1 by quantifying the total mge abundances the abundance of mobilome of effluents in hk ranged from 1 36 to 4 11 copies of mges per cell which was moderately abundant compared with counterparts in wwtps from other locations since mge themselves are not regarded as pollutants but contributors to the dissemination of args we did not conduct exposure ranking on mobilome profile nevertheless the quantification of the broad spectrum of mges covering transposases insertion elements integrons integrative and conjugative elements and plasmids helps to understand the dissemination possibility of args which is explicitly included in the list of factors possessing higher health risk of specific samples 3 2 local temporal variations in effluents influents and as in absolute quantification in hk the differences of arg and mge abundance and diversity among three wwtps were compared over 13 months an absolute quantification method in the unit of the copy of arg per ml was applied results showed that the overall concentrations of args were 9 11 4 20 105 copies ml 5 88 2 28 105 copies ml and 9 14 7 54 105 copiesml in st stl and swh effluents respectively while the mges were quantified to be 4 39 2 23 106 copies ml 2 90 0 58 106 copies ml and 4 68 3 59 106 copies ml in the corresponding wwtps fig 2 a fig s4 in st the overall concentration of args in effluents varied over time in a stochastic pattern however the quinolone resistant genes clearly emerged to be among the top abundant arg types after july 2018 maybe due to the sewage bringing the increased amount of quinolone resistant bacteria into wwtps in stl effluent the temporal variation of total arg concentration was moderate compared with others whereas the concentration of sulfonamide resistant genes occasionally increased in may july partially due to the relevant increase in stl as in swh there was a sharp increase of the overall arg concentration in december 2018 probably due to a surge of biomass in the effluent since there were merely slight changes in the proportion of arg types fig 2a and the overall abundance fig s3 additionally for st and stl the most abundant arg type shifted over sampling time from multidrug to beta lactam and sulfonamide resistance genes whereas in swh multidrug resistant genes were constantly the most abundant arg types in the 13 months there were no significant seasonal changes in the studied period among the 814 detected args reference sequence level and 248 detected mges only limited numbers of args and mges were studied in absolute quantification in previous studies summarized in fig 2b and table s2 results showed that the absolute quantification methods on metagenomics used in this study are comparable to prior studies based on qpcr methods in contrast to low throughput in previous qpcr studies a much broader spectrum of args and mobile genetic elements were detected in this study using the comprehensive databases of 1208 args genotypes and 280 mge reference genes 3 3 args were removed significantly by wwtps overall the removal efficiencies of args were 2 34 0 27 2 37 0 23 and 2 44 0 38 in the unit of log10 reduction for st stl and swh wwtps respectively however for the specific arg types the removal efficiencies were quite different fig 3 b vancomycin resistance genes were eliminated most efficiently in st wwtp and tetracycline and mls were with over 2 5 log reduction in both st and swh wwtps stl wwtp had the highest removal efficiency of polymyxin and kasugamycin resistance gene among the total 21 arg types detected in effluent samples of the three wwtps 16 were shown in fig 3 since the other 5 arg types including bleomycin carbomycin fosfomycin puromycin and tetracenomycin c were less than the average detection limits of the metagenomic approach used in the present study which were estimated to be 2 3 to 4 7 104 copies ml in the influents and 3 8 to 7 5 102 copies ml in the effluents there were shared arg subtypes among influent as and effluent fig 3a taking st wwtp as an example among the total 653 arg subtypes introduced by influent 215 were not detected anymore in all the effluent samples after treatment while 121 args were still found in all the effluent and 317 args were occasionally detected in different samples there were 24 args particularly found in effluent but not detected in the influent samples most likely because of the estimation bias due to the limited sequencing depth of these genes all these 24 args belonged to the five less abundant arg types mentioned above furthermore the core resistomes shared by the same sample type of three wwtps were shown in figure s5 3 4 arg variants with high risk in wwtp effluents hundreds of detected args in the environments were reported to pose health risks at different levels zhang et al 2021 the 8145 arg variants detected from the effluents in hk were categorized into five ranks rank i ii iii iv and unassessed according to their risk levels following the method published by zhang et al 2021 which ranks the risk of arg variants based on comprehensive data mining on anthropogenic prevalence the mobility of genes and the potential pathogenicity of the args carrying bacteria it was noteworthy that the total abundances of rank i args in st and stl were over the global average abundance fig 4 a although the total arg abundance of both st and stl were below the global average fig 1c indicting the potential higher risk of args in hk effluents as shown in fig 4b the average removal efficiency of rank i args was relatively lower than that of rank ii and rank iii in all the three wwtps in total 72 out of 122 rank i args were detected in hk effluents accounting for 3 86 2 39 1 49 0 35 and 1 01 0 28 of the total abundance in st stl and swh effluents respectively among these rank i args abe98197 a qnrs gene conferring quinolone resistance were detected in high abundance with 1 23 1 08 10 2 2 55 0 87 10 3 7 95 3 56 10 4 copy per cell in st stl and swh respectively remarkably abe98197 was among the 41 major arg variants in hk effluents 5 10 3 copy per cell in at least one out of 39 effluent samples in three wwtps figure s6 arousing the alarming concern on this gene 3 5 source tracking of effluents to manage the args in effluents a better understanding of the sources is required therefore a source tracking approach was used to decipher the relationship between influent as and effluent fig 5 a results showed the contribution ratios of as and influent were 60 x223c 80 and 20 30 of the total resistome in the effluent which delineated that as more than influents shaped arg abundance and structure in effluents this result was similar to the previous reports quintela baluja et al 2019 lee et al 2020 and indicated that the residual portion of resistome in effluents is more likely to be mediated by indigenous bacteria of as than by fecal microbial contamination in the influent 3 6 contributing factors to the resistomes of as a further analysis was conducted to decipher the direct and indirect contributing factors to the resistome of as and influent including antibiotic concentration bacterial communities and mges etc fig 5b sem analysis showed that as resistome was influenced by bacterial community and mge abundance the concentration of antibiotics was shown to be an insignificant factor shaping either arg abundances or mges abundances 4 discussion wwtps are critical points connecting urbanized citizens with the environment indeed as a component within the urban wastewater cycle wwtps are regarded as the very likely hotspot in which excreted and discarded antibiotics can induce the proliferation of args and antibiotic resistant bacteria discharged into wwtps from multiple sources influents of wwtps as the wastewater from the served community recapitulate 97 of human fecal microbial communities newton et al 2015 thus influents act as a proxy at the community level of the epidemiology of resistant pathogens within the catchment areas the microbes in as are a microbial community distinct from influents with over 700 bacteria genera in high biomass density generally 2 10 g l ju and zhang 2015 the discharged effluents shaped by both influents and as can impact the receiving environment in this study effluent resistome were comprehensively assessed from the perspective of risk evaluation a consecutive monthly sampling in 13 months was conducted in three hk wwtps providing valuable materials for exploring the dissemination and proliferation of args in the whole process of wwtps on a temporal scale the global profiles of arg abundance and diversity in the effluent of wwtps were investigated by collecting the publicly available datasets of wwtps with biological treatment in cities across north america chu et al 2018 south america pehrsson et al 2016 europe bengtsson palme et al 2016 ju et al 2019 and asia fresia et al 2019 results demonstrated significantly distinct resistome profiles in effluents across cities while slight differences among effluents in three hk wwtps the diverse abundances of args in the unit of copy per cell led to an exposure ranking scheme including level 1 2 3 and 4 for quantitative understanding of the exposure and informed management of resistome in effluents with a global baseline the different abundances of those geographically close locations indicated that climates or latitudes might not be the main shaping factors on args in effluents which was also mentioned in previous reports cacace et al 2019 zhu et al 2017 nevertheless the varied technologies applied in these wwtps table s4 and distinct characteristics of sewages in different cities may contribute to different levels of resistome in effluents for the convenience of research communication and government consultancy the exposure ranking scheme developed and the global resistome profile of wwtps analyzed in the present study were shared on a publicly available platform https smile hku hk resistancewwtps fig 6 parallel comparisons can be easily conducted to determine the exposure level of a sample or an area following the user friendly pipeline limitations are due to the restricted availability of metagenomic datasets in effluent samples inadequate sequencing depths and uneven geographical distribution of the collected data additionally the assumption of 100 dna extraction efficiency will underestimate the concentrations of args therefore it reinforces the need for the platform s development to expand the collection of representative samples across the world to further improve the exposure ranking scheme and correct dna extraction efficiency by using spiked positive controls to have a more accurate absolute quantification method the investigated hk wwtps had relatively high efficiency in eliminating args compared with the global average the raw wastewater in hk contained abundant args which was higher than the global average level fig 1b while after efficient treatment arg abundances in effluents of hk wwtps were lower than the global average fig 1c however there were still some concerns regarding resistome in the effluent of hk wwtp first the temporal variations of several important arg types including the quinolone resistance genes indicated the limited capability in dealing with the fluctuation of args in the influent second arg variants with high risk in rank i including abe98197 a qnrs gene were still highly abundant in effluents qnrs gene was associated with five nosocomial pathogens including mrsa vrefm esbl producing enterobacteriaceae carbapenem resistant enterobacteriaceae and carbapenem resistant a baumannii ho et al 2017 indeed our study based on the assembled contigs of the same samples showed 19 qnrs carrying enterobacterales genomes detected in effluents including e coli and klebsiella pneumonia these arg variants in effluent with the high mobility and the high pathogenicity potential of their hosts may cause arg dissemination in the receiving environments and the threats to the human health what needs to mention is that the detection of args by metagenomics does not mean the occurrence of viable resistant bacteria so the functional demonstrations and other traditional microbial approaches are still in their necessity to evaluate the risk of args in wwtp effluents comprehensively overall special attention is needed to advance the management strategy on these risky args and arb in the effluent 5 conclusions this study intensively sampled three wwtps in hk over 13 months and collected datasets from other cities worldwide to comprehensively assess the level of resistome in both spatial and temporal scales specifically hk effluents were ranked in level 2 and level 3 out of the ranking scheme based on the total arg abundances indicating moderate pollution of args in effluents of wwtps in hk moreover an absolute quantification approach was adopted to quantify temporal variations in the effluent resistome the disclosed distinct changes over time among different arg types indicate the requirement of a solution of real time management of wwtp systems arg variants of the highest risk rank i were present at a much higher abundance in the effluent of wwtps in hk compared with the global average level indicating the potential risk of args in hk effluent source tracking revealed that as contributed more than influent in shaping effluent resistome further sem analysis deduced that bacterial community and horizontal gene transfer activities were the primary factors that affect the as resistome while antibiotic concentrations were minor factors taken together the present study demonstrated an exposure assessment scheme regarding total arg abundance and risky arg variants in hk effluents although the wwtps functioned well in removing args with high efficiency the spatial and temporal variance still called for attention on resistome and mobilome risk

16391,widespread wastewater pollution is a major barrier to the sustainable management of freshwater and coastal marine ecosystems worldwide integrated multi disciplinary studies are necessary to improve waterway management and protect ecosystem integrity this study used the generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation glue methodology to link microbial community ecotoxicology laboratory data to a mechanistic aquatic ecosystem response model the generic model provided good predictive skill for major water quality constituents including heterotrophic bacteria dynamics r2 0 91 the model was validated against observed data across a gradient of effluent concentrations from community whole effluent toxicity wet laboratory tests glue analysis revealed that a combined likelihood measure increased confidence in the predictive capability of the model this study highlights the importance of calibrating aquatic ecosystem response models with net growth rates i e sum of the growth minus loss rate parameter terms of biological functional groups the final calibrated net growth rate value of heterotrophic bacteria determined using the glue analysis was selected to be 0 58 which was significantly greater than the average literature value of 0 15 this finding demonstrated that use of literature parameter values without a good understanding of the represented processes could create misleading outputs and result in unsatisfactory conclusions further fixed bulk mineralisation rate literature values are typically higher than realistically required in aquatic ecosystem response models this indicates that explicitly including bacterial mineralisation is crucial to represent microbial ecosystem functioning more accurately our study suggests that improved data collection and modelling efforts in real world management applications are needed to better address nutrients released into the natural environment future studies should aim to better understand the sensitivity of aquatic ecosystem response models to bacterial mineralisation rates graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction widespread wastewater pollution is one of the greatest challenges

phytoplankton mucus production adams et al 2020 anderson et al 2002 davidson et al 2014 and human health issues associated with pathogens johnson et al 2010 these pressures pose compounding wastewater

linking pressure stressor response relationships for the global issue of wastewater pollution burdon et al 2020 jeffries et al 2016 mansfeldt et al 2020 mayer pinto et al 2015 ruprecht et al 2021 significant knowledge gaps remain in our ability to model changes to wastewater discharges and management practices microbial communities exhibit significant metabolic and functional diversity thompson et al 2017 torsvik et al 2002 and are essential regulators of global biogeochemical cycles ecosystem productivity and climate change birrer et al 2019 cavicchioli et al 2019 wu et al 2019 the genetic structure and function of microbial communities are directly associated with the physical and chemical properties of the environment ruprecht et al 2021 as a result microbial communities are highly sensitive to environmental change broad scale stressors such as wastewater discharge and eutrophication can also significantly alter community evolutionary dynamics as species adapt to novel environmental conditions scheuerl et al 2020 this has potential implications for understanding growth rates associated with essential microbial processes such as bacterial mineralisation nitrification and denitrification which are responsible for the decay of organic material and the removal of excess nitrogen in waterbodies a common problem downstream of effluent outfalls santos et al 2008 further research is needed to integrate knowledge of microbial and nutrient dynamics associated with wastewater impacts to improve waterway management and protect ecosystem integrity importantly bacterial dynamics are rarely included in numerical modelling tools used for broad scale water planning and waterway management in practice nutrient enrichment in aquatic ecosystems is commonly addressed using numerical models to assess changes in water quality including different wastewater impact scenarios özkundakci et al 2011 robson 2014a coupled aquatic ecosystem response models are used to simulate hydrology hydraulics and biogeochemical processes over broad spatial and temporal scales robson 2014b salmon et al 2017 a hydrodynamics approach to managing wastewater impacts in aquatic environments is suitable in instances where there is sufficient volume and flux e g regular tidal exchange short residence times large catchment inflows etc to assimilate nutrient inputs within the system this macro management approach assumes that mixing and dilution processes provide water quality benefits to aquatic ecosystems including a reduction in algal chl a blooms e g bricker et al 2008 davidson et al 2014 while often ignoring the wastewater impacts on bacterial processes and functioning suitable linkages are required between hydrodynamics algae and bacteria in aquatic ecosystem response models to elucidate microbial community and nutrient dynamics in waterways there is increasing evidence that including bacterial dynamics in aquatic ecosystem response models leads to more realistic representation of carbon and nutrient i e n and p mineralisation processes gal et al 2009 li et al 2014a liu et al 2015 however there are relatively few examples of aquatic ecosystem response models that include a microbial loop in part because there have been few integrated studies that provide the necessary information regarding bacterial processes and hydrodynamic model calibration and validation combined field and laboratory ecotoxicology studies that assess microbial dynamics can provide opportunities to better quantify bacterial processes growth kinetics as well as community structure and functional changes in response to wastewater pollution exposure traditionally laboratory microbial ecotoxicological studies have relied on the combination of single species e g individual microalgae toxicity testing and chemical exposure surveys to ascertain the aggregate toxic effect of whole effluent wastewater discharges birrer et al 2017 in recognition of the practical limitations of single species laboratory toxicity testing brandt et al 2004 guckert 1996 ruprecht et al 2020a ruprecht et al 2020b presented a novel combination of microbial community whole effluent toxicity wet testing at a complete range of wastewater effluent concentrations and complimentary genomic tools to provide insights into key bacterial processes this included nutrient and organic matter cycling and the identification of thresholds of community and functional change importantly ruprecht et al 2020a ruprecht et al 2020b also provided high quality pilot ecotoxicological datasets that can be used to explicitly vs implicitly when mechanisms are ignored calculate bacterial dynamics and assess parameter uncertainty in mechanistic aquatic ecosystem response models to validate the inclusion of bacterial dynamics in an aquatic ecosystem response model and enhance its application it is necessary to assess and minimise potential sources of prediction uncertainty that may arise when building more complex models prediction uncertainty in numerical models can arise from three common technical challenges including model structure input data and parameterisation model structure uncertainty is associated with the selection of suitable formulations state variables or processes especially biological that adequately reproduce ecosystem dynamics hipsey et al 2020 mannina and viviani 2009 uncertainty in input data e g field monitoring experimental observations etc from real world biogeochemical processes can arise due to the natural variability in these processes measurement errors and or insufficient data to capture emergent trends parameter uncertainty is confronted during the model calibration process and is typically higher with increasing model parameters i e more complex models while less common in aquatic ecosystem response models e g mannina and viviani 2009 optimisation algorithms such as the generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation glue methodology arhonditsis et al 2008 beven and binley 1992 freer et al 1996 nott et al 2012 ruessink 2006 can account for prediction uncertainty due to parameter variability which is rarely reported simmons et al 2017 to date no other studies link microbial community data from an ecotoxicology laboratory study to improve our understanding of bacterial mineralisation processes in mechanistic aquatic ecosystem response models in this study model performance and uncertainty due to parameter space variability is assessed using the glue methodology combined with monte carlo sampling from uniform prior distributions of individual parameters we identify sensitive model parameters and derive rate values that validate the modelling framework and improve the prediction of microbial community and nutrient dynamic responses to wastewater pollution the outcomes of this study have immediate implications for water quality sampling and testing as well as for improving our understanding and management of wastewater released into the natural environment 2 methods 2 1 study site and sampling the hunter river estuary 151 8 e 32 9 s is located on the temperate southeast coastline of nsw australia the study site is typical of many regulated estuaries in developed coastal regions globally which receive high nutrient discharges from several major wastewater treatment plants wwtp the hunter river wwtp are universally representative of tertiary level wastewater treatment practices designed to remove excess nutrients of nitrogen and phosphorus asano et al 2007 whole

methods used with free and open access to the full dataset are provided elsewhere in ruprecht et al 2019 ruprecht et al 2020a and ruprecht et al 2020b in brief unfiltered sterile effluent post uv treatment was sampled from a mid estuary wwtp outfall discharging to the hunter river riverine background water was collected from the hunter river at a nominal location upstream of the major wwtp discharge points across the estuary fig 1 a wet tests were performed by mixing sterile effluent with riverine water providing an initial microbial community and treatment levels of 0 effluent 0 1

beakers were well mixed with a glass stirring rod and samples from each treatment were taken for further analysis including 1 ml of water for microbial cell counts using flow cytometry and approximately 500 ml of water for dna extraction and sequencing using standard techniques flow cytometry was used to distinguish between total bacterial and algal cell populations in the water samples a 488 nm laser was used for excitation of both syto9 stain total bacteria cells and chlorophyll a total algal cells fluorescence detection targeted bacteria and chlorophyll a using emission filters

values for freshwater and marine bacterioplankton kroer 1994 lee and fuhrman 1987 average bacterial concentrations of approximately 0 2 mg l were determined from the community wet tests algal biomass

role of bacteria in other microbial processes such as nitrification and denitrification are expressed implicitly using bulk conversion rates which are unchanged from earlier versions of rma 11 http ikingrma iinet net au heterotrophic bacteria growth and their ability to mineralise organic matter is assumed to be primarily limited by nutrients from the dissolved organic matter pool encompassing c

phytoplankton growth a summary of the equations used in the bacteria sub model of rma 11 is provided in appendix a in this study a depth averaged box model was built based on the design of the community wet tests to represent the microbial and nutrient dynamics observed during the experiment the model was configured to replicate the community wet tests by simulating a beaker as a single element having square dimensions of 0 13 m and an initial water depth of 0 12 m c initial volume of 2 l simulations were run on a timestep of 15 min for a period of 72 h after each 24 h period the water depth in the model was reduced by 0 03 m to simulate a volume loss of approximately 0 5 l due to water sampling the model simulated three separate functional groups of micro zooplankton

beaker and the focus of this study was on pelagic microbial communities further all settling terms were set to zero as the beaker was stirred after every nominal 24 h period and assumed to be well mixed which justifies using a depth average model an overview of the modelled trophic structure and associated complex series of constituent interactions is provided in fig 2 simulations were

literature values for average dry body mass robson et al 2018 a summary of the model input data derived from the high 90 effluent concentration treatment in the community wet tests are provided in supplementary table 3 2 3 model validation and assessment the glue methodology uses a likelihood measure s to assign different levels of confidence weighting to different parameter sets reflecting their ability to acceptably reproduce observations of the system dynamics in this application of the glue methodology the performance and hence likelihood measure of each individual parameter set in providing a good fit to the observations was determined using a brier skill score bss the bss is a suitable and commonly used measure of model skill within a glue analysis particularly in coastal simmons et al 2017 van rijn et al 2003 and hydrological freer et al 1996 pappenberger et al 2009 modelling applications the brier skill score is defined as 2 b s s 1 b 0 b m 2 b 0 b b 2 where b 0 is the observed mean bacteria concentration from the community wet tests at time t hrs b m is the final modelled bacteria concentration at time t h and b b is the observed bacteria concentration at time 0 h i e reference point like other likelihood measures a bss value of 1 indicates good agreement of the model predictions with the observed data while a value of 0 indicates no change from the initial condition and less than 0 represents dissimilar behaviour or poor model performance a bss threshold of 0 or greater was applied to the likelihood measure to exclude non behavioural runs from the parameter optimisation analysis this was a suitable assumption because the community wet tests were run over a short period and the addition of wastewater effluent to the beakers stimulated microbial growth from the initial condition after selection of the behavioural runs in each case likelihood values were rescaled so that the cumulative total sum to 1 the weighting assigned to individual behavioural runs were used to calculate posterior distributions of each trialled parameter evaluate the skill of each individual parameter set in reproducing the physical observations and to provide suitable estimates of individual parameter values the likelihood measure l b s s for ith model run is defined as 3 l b s s i b s s i i 1 n b s s i where n is the total number of behavioural runs i e bss 0 and the likelihood is calculated from the skill of each individual behavioural model run b s s i a single likelihood measure was calculated using observed and modelled bacterial biomass data further parameter optimisation analysis was conducted using a combined likelihood measure based on the product of individual likelihood values calculated for bacteria and algae biomasses as determined by 4 c l i 1 n l l b s s i 1 n l where each likelihood value l b s s i of the total number of likelihood measures n l were combined a maximum of 10 000 random monte carlo simulations were used for each application of the glue methodology to define the parameter space parameter values used in the model assessment are given in table 1 initial ranges of the model parameter values were sourced from relevant literature see table 1 footnotes and the recently conducted community wet tests where possible the literature information and modeller experience was used to reduce the dimensions and plausible value range of the parameter space an initial glue analysis considered 28 model parameters across a plausible range of each parameter using continuous uniform prior distributions beven and binley 1992 to maximise the number of behavioural monte carlo simulations this exploratory analysis on the initial parameter space was used to select the most sensitive model calibration parameters and adjust the value ranges for application in a more refined glue analysis a similar approach using a refined glue analysis was conducted by simmons et al 2017 and arhonditsis et al 2008 model parameters excluded from the refined glue analysis were typically taken as the average literature value following application of the glue methodology model performance of the selected calibration parameter set was assessed based on visual inspection of time series plots of simulated and observed data along with a number of quantitative measures five statistical coefficients were considered including coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe of efficiency nse percentage bias bias root mean squared error rmse and the ratio of rmse to the standard deviation rmse std the uncertainty bounds of the predicted output likelihood weighted distribution was also calculated using the 95 confidence percentiles further details on the statistical correlation values are provided in appendix b 3 results 3 1 sensitivity testing glue analysis identified sensitive model rate parameters that improved the prediction of microbial community responses to wastewater pollution revealing new insights for modelling and key drivers of heterotrophic bacterial community growth at affected sites fig 3 shows the general model sensitivity to the top five trialled parameters for the initial and refined value ranges as provided in table 1 in predicting the observed bacterial dynamics in the community wet tests i e a single measure of model performance an initial glue analysis conducted on 10 000 simulations and 28 model parameters revealed the top five most sensitive parameters this is shown by the difference between the cumulative likelihoods and uniform distributions and the kolmogorov smirnov d statistic values ranging from 0 to 1 with a d value of 1 characterising a more sensitive parameter from highest to lowest the five most sensitive parameters were hbac grw hbac hs carb hbac doc exc hbac nmort and hbac rsp all other parameters tested in the initial glue analysis were relatively insensitive to predicting bacterial dynamics in the model with calculated kolmogorov smirnov d statistic values less than 0 04 not shown in fig 3 approximately 30 of the total model runs in the initial glue analysis were determined to be behavioural i e bss 0 with the majority of the behavioural runs 95 showing strong dependence on the maximum bacterial growth rate parameter between values of 0 6 and 1 4 fig 3 after further interrogation of the initial parameter sensitivity a refined glue analysis comprised an additional 10 000 simulations and varied only the initial top five trialled parameters within reduced ranges particularly the maximum bacterial growth rate the refined glue analysis was constrained based on a prior uniform distribution of the net growth rate calculated in eq 1 of heterotrophic bacteria from approximately 0 5 to 0 9 model sensitivity to the maximum bacterial growth rate can be seen again fig 3 however the results of the refined value ranges reveal the relative insensitivity of the model to all other individual rate parameters 3 2 parameter optimisation the refined glue analysis revealed that the best results i e bins with higher likelihood weighted density for predicting bacterial dynamics are obtained when the specific rate parameters of heterotrophic bacteria are set to values that optimise the net growth rate in the model fig 4 provides the likelihood weighted posterior distributions for the net growth and specific loss rate parameters of heterotrophic bacteria based on the refined value ranges provided in table 1 the posterior distributions of the net growth and loss rate terms reveal a more detailed understanding of parameter sensitivity with greater than 90 of the total model runs deemed behavioural compared to the initial glue analysis higher likelihood values occur when the net growth rate of heterotrophic bacteria is in the range from 0 55 to 0 75 which is greater than the average literature value of 0 15 table 1 the results indicate the model is relatively insensitive to the three bacterial loss terms i e respiration excretion and mortality rate parameters in the refined value ranges with small localised peaks in the posterior distribution response surfaces so that no single global optimum parameter set could be easily identified in addition the range in the top 1 likelihood values or parameter sets blue shaded region in fig 4 encompasses the entire value ranges of the trialled individual loss terms while the top 0 1 likelihood values x symbols in fig 4 show less spread for all parameters and offer some guidance to modellers for selecting parameter values for individual loss terms the results shown in fig 4 highlight the potential limitations of using only one constituent i e bacteria biomass to assess model performance and to differentiate between the skill of all parameter sets investigated individual parameters were modestly optimised when likelihood measures were combined for both bacteria and algae to find the most generally reliable calibrated parameter sets fig 5 provides the combined likelihood weighted posterior distributions for the same parameters previously discussed as well as the calculated maximum growth and net loss rates the maximum growth rate of heterotrophic bacteria indicate a higher combined likelihood at higher values ranging from approximately 1 0 to 1 25 when compared to average literature values of approximately 1 0 the results indicate the net growth rate of heterotrophic bacteria is dominated by the maximum growth rate selected value 1 1 the selected value for specific rate parameters of heterotrophic bacteria is the highest combined likelihood value determined by the refined glue analysis 1 15 with lesser influence from the net loss rate selected value1 0 57 which is comprised of several bacterial loss terms i e respiration mortality and excretion the respiration and excretion rates show higher combined likelihood at lower values compared to average literature values of 0 23 and 0 7 respectively indicating that the model performs better for both bacteria and algae when bacterial losses are reduced the statistical findings provide greater confidence when selecting rate values for respiration selected value1 0 08 and excretion selected value1 0 19 due to the reduced ranges in the top 1 and 0 1 likelihood values fig 5 despite the model being insensitive to the natural mortality rate of heterotrophic bacteria the net loss rate can be used to calculate a mortality rate selected value1 0 30 which is higher than the average literature value for this rate parameter table 1 the combination of the selected specific rate parameters values of heterotrophic bacteria result in a net growth rate equal to 0 58 3 3 uncertainty analysis and model validation the implications of parameter induced uncertainty on model performance in predicting heterotrophic bacteria and photo autotrophic algae was examined using the top 1 of behavioural likelihood values determined by applying the glue method the results of the top 1 of behavioural likelihood values are shown in fig 6 for two calculated independent measures of model performance fig 6 reveals that the model has reasonable skill for both the single and combined likelihood measures in reproducing the observed increases in biomass of the two microbial communities fig 6 shows the top 1 of parameter sets predicted a narrower concentration range for the single likelihood measure compared to the combined likelihood measure against the mean observed bacterial concentrations in the community wet tests after 72 h however the reverse relationship is true for the mean observed algal concentrations after 72 h to provide further insight of parameter induced uncertainty on model performance the selected values for the specific rate parameters of heterotrophic bacteria are plotted against the modelled range of behavioural runs and the observed data range in fig 7 this indicates that the mean modelled concentrations were generally in close agreement with the mean observed concentrations after 48 h however the total behavioural model runs predicted a wide concentration range after 72 h with a large number of the behavioural runs predicting almost no change in the bacterial community while the parameter uncertainty bounds 95 confidence for the behavioural runs were relatively narrow there is evidence of epistemic errors i e errors related to input data and or model formulation as the uncertainty bounds do not encompass the observed average bacterial community dynamics in the community wet tests despite the presence of these errors the best modelled concentration profile provides a relatively good fit to the observed data indicating the benefit of using combined likelihood measures to identify a reliable set of individual parameter values for application in aquatic ecosystem response models to further validate the model framework and the selected values for the specific rate parameters of heterotrophic bacteria results of an extended 21 day simulation are provided in supplementary fig 1 the extended duration simulation model was configured with a static water level i e no change in volume to illustrate model stability in reaching mass equilibrium supplementary fig 1 shows heterotrophic bacteria biomass reaches a peak concentration on day 6 and stabilises after day 12 the results illustrate that a positive net growth rate of 0 58 applied in this model does not lead to unconstrained growth in heterotrophic bacteria the model results for predicting heterotrophic bacteria across the full range of effluent concentrations i e 0 to 90 in the community wet tests are provided in supplementary fig 2 the same selected parameter values derived for the 90 effluent concentration treatment were applied to all other modelled effluent concentrations in each model run initial concentrations were varied for all water quality constituents in line with observed data except for particulate organic carbon dissolved organic and inorganic carbon and micro zooplankton because there was no observed data supplementary fig 2 shows the bacteria model generally captures the growth patterns in the observed heterotrophic bacteria counts from the community wet tests while there was high variability across the full range of effluent concentrations the model performed the best r2 0 91 in the 90 effluent concentration treatment case 4 discussion integrated studies are necessary to provide the valuable information needed to improve operational management tools such as mechanistic aquatic ecosystem response models that serve to align catchment water planning and decision making with community values e g swimming fishing etc a central goal of current waterway management strategies this study used unique data derived from a recent laboratory ecotoxicology study ruprecht et al 2021 ruprecht et al 2020a ruprecht et al 2020b linking pressure stressor response relationships in riverine microbial communities to wastewater impacts to validate the inclusion of a microbial loop in a well established aquatic ecosystem response model the generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation glue methodology combined with a simple monte carlo sampling scheme was applied to a depth averaged box model to assess model performance and parameter induced uncertainty compared to the laboratory ecotoxicology data it was found that the generic model has reasonable predictive skill for heterotrophic bacteria dynamics after validating the model against observed data across the full range of effluent concentrations i e 0 0 1 1 10 50 and 90 effluents in the community wet tests this study has implications towards evidence based parameterisation of aquatic ecosystem response models robson et al 2018 and real world modelling applications around the common practice of wastewater discharge to waterways and eutrophication the major premise of the glue methodology is to find behavioural simulations derived from a large number of independent parameter sets influenced by the chosen likelihood measure used to assess model performance against the observed data ratto et al 2001 to improve the reliability of the results obtained from the glue analysis it is often advantageous for modellers to use a combined likelihood measure when compared to a single likelihood to assess model performance by pooling available data e g arhonditsis et al 2008 simmons et al 2017 in this study we demonstrated that a single likelihood measure suited heterotrophic bacteria better than algae whereas when a combined likelihood measure was used the model fit to heterotrophic bacteria was compromised and modestly improved for algae cf fig 6 while the results showed more spread in the model prediction of heterotrophic bacteria using a combined likelihood measure adding an additional constituent i e algae data improved the optimisation of individual bacterial rate parameters which were previously insensitive using a single likelihood measure a combined likelihood measure should also increase confidence in the model validation as more constituents used in the calibration process typically increases the generic predictive capability of a model hellweger 2017 robson et al 2018 our results validated the selection of individual bacterial rate parameter values within the upper and lower bounds of the top 1 of behavioural combined likelihood values which provided a reasonably good fit to the observed microbial and nutrient dynamics in the community wet tests cf supplementary fig 2 the glue analysis illustrates the difficulty in calibrating mechanistic aquatic ecosystem response models which are relatively insensitive to the individual rate parameters e g natural heterotrophic bacteria mortality however using a combined likelihood measure enables modellers to gain a better understanding of the represented processes and the sometimes difficult trade offs required to establish values for these parameters this study reveals that the differences in the time varying response of functional group s and or individual species employed in mechanistic aquatic ecosystem response models are predominantly controlled by their net growth rates providing new insights for model calibration the net growth rate is determined in every aquatic ecosystem response model by the sum of the growth minus the loss terms cf eq 1 such that a positive net growth rate would result in an increase in abundance or biomass i e growth loss whereas a negative net growth rate results in biological decay i e growth loss in rma 11 and like most operational aquatic ecosystem response models the sensitivity of the net growth rate can be adjusted by changing the nutrient limitations applied through the michaelis menten nutrient kinetics and half saturation constants traditional model calibration approaches have focused on adjusting specific rate parameters of individual functional groups within plausible value ranges typically sourced from local observations or peer reviewed literature by trial and error manual calibration hipsey et al 2020 or occasionally through optimisation algorithms such as the glue approach applied in this study robson et al 2018 in practice studies documenting model calibration of aquatic biota such as phytoplankton arhonditsis et al 2008 robson and hamilton 2004 and heterotrophic bacteria gal et al 2009 li et al 2014a liu et al 2015 have ignored any discussion regarding the net effects of combining growth and loss terms on system dynamics or in constraining parameter prior distributions the net growth rate of heterotrophic bacteria from empirical literature growth and loss rate parameter values widely ranged from 1 0 to 0 7 cf table 1 in this study the final calibrated net growth rate parameter value of heterotrophic bacteria determined using the refined glue analysis was selected to be 0 58 cf section 3 2 which is significantly greater than the average literature value of 0 15 in this study if the negative average net growth rate value from the literature was applied in the water quality model this would create misleading results and an unsatisfactory conclusion for the model calibration and validation process this finding underscores the need for caution when modellers attempt to a priori assemble a consistent set of values for individual rate parameters without a fundamental process understanding of the aquatic ecosystem response model and its formulations particularly since there are relatively few available empirical measurements in the literature relevant to some modelled biogeochemical processes e g heterotrophic bacteria loss rates in recognising that the prior distributions of the individual rate parameters are not independent of each other as often thought e g arhonditsis et al 2008 but that they are directly related through an inherent net growth rate governed by the model formulation the model validation and parameter optimisation processes were improved the novel application of community level ecotoxicology data used to validate the inclusion of bacterial mineralisation processes within an aquatic ecosystem response model framework represents a significant advancement over previous modelling studies that have investigated the role of bacterial dynamics in addressing the eutrophication problem it is widely acknowledged that every water quality model has some degree of structural error because they are usually representing aggregate processes based on a conceptual understanding of the real system hipsey et al 2020 robson et al 2018 while the beaker model is a finite system the community wet tests have relevance to real world conditions and in this application provides new insights into understanding the importance of bacterial mineralisation in the parameterisation of mechanistic aquatic ecosystem response models as previously discussed it is often difficult to find relevant parameter values in the literature and this issue is compounded by incorrectly assigning the role of bacteria in the mineralisation of dissolved organic matter dom to fixed rate parameters that may compensate for missing functionality in a general form this can be demonstrated by comparing the dom mineralisation rates of a more conventional approach fixed rate conversion with the monod formulation used in this study fig 8 where bacterial activity is a linear function of concentration a typical average value for fixed bulk mineralisation rates grouped for c n and p sourced from relevant literature is approximately 0 1 day cf table 1 for references our work suggests that typical fixed bulk mineralisation rates found in the literature are higher than realistically required for typical microbial and nutrient concentrations in high bacterial growth situations such as blooms individual mineralisation rates can vary by an order of magnitude as demonstrated from applying fig 8 to the modelling results in supplementary fig 1 while fixed mineralisation rates may produce good model predictions in some circumstances it reduces i the connection between models and the processes they represent ii the predictive capability of the model and iii the ability to anticipate circumstances in which these models may fail kruk et al 2011 ramin et al 2011 robson et al 2018 further the more we try to include a better representation of system functionality e g bacterial traits and processes the better we can expect our aquatic ecosystem response models to perform 5 conclusion integrated multi disciplinary studies that elucidate microbial and nutrient dynamics associated with gradients in environmental stressors such as widespread wastewater pollution are necessary to improve waterway management and protect ecosystem integrity this study used the generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation glue methodology to present a novel link between microbial community ecotoxicology laboratory data and a mechanistic aquatic ecosystem response model it was revealed that a better understanding of the represented processes can be developed using a combined likelihood measure that increases confidence in the predictive capability of the model this requires trade offs on individual likelihoods to establish individual rate parameter values we have shown that i net growth rates of the biological components are of key importance when calibrating aquatic ecosystem response models ii behavioural model results require rate parameter values outside the typical literature ranges reported in table 1 and iii explicitly including bacterial mineralisation in water quality models removes the need for fixed bulk rate parameter values and improves representation of microbial ecosystem functioning this study suggests that improved data collection and modelling efforts in real world management applications are needed to better address

16391,widespread wastewater pollution is a major barrier to the sustainable management of freshwater and coastal marine ecosystems worldwide integrated multi disciplinary studies are necessary to improve waterway management and protect ecosystem integrity this study used the generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation glue methodology to link microbial community ecotoxicology laboratory data to a mechanistic aquatic ecosystem response model the generic model provided good predictive skill for major water quality constituents including heterotrophic bacteria dynamics r2 0 91 the model was validated against observed data across a gradient of effluent concentrations from community whole effluent toxicity wet laboratory tests glue analysis revealed that a combined likelihood measure increased confidence in the predictive capability of the model this study highlights the importance of calibrating aquatic ecosystem response models with net growth rates i e sum of the growth minus loss rate parameter terms of biological functional groups the final calibrated net growth rate value of heterotrophic bacteria determined using the glue analysis was selected to be 0 58 which was significantly greater than the average literature value of 0 15 this finding demonstrated that use of literature parameter values without a good understanding of the represented processes could create misleading outputs and result in unsatisfactory conclusions further fixed bulk mineralisation rate literature values are typically higher than realistically required in aquatic ecosystem response models this indicates that explicitly including bacterial mineralisation is crucial to represent microbial ecosystem functioning more accurately our study suggests that improved data collection and modelling efforts in real world management applications are needed to better address nutrients released into the natural environment future studies should aim to better understand the sensitivity of aquatic ecosystem response models to bacterial mineralisation rates graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction widespread wastewater pollution is one of the greatest challenges

phytoplankton mucus production adams et al 2020 anderson et al 2002 davidson et al 2014 and human health issues associated with pathogens johnson et al 2010 these pressures pose compounding wastewater

linking pressure stressor response relationships for the global issue of wastewater pollution burdon et al 2020 jeffries et al 2016 mansfeldt et al 2020 mayer pinto et al 2015 ruprecht et al 2021 significant knowledge gaps remain in our ability to model changes to wastewater discharges and management practices microbial communities exhibit significant metabolic and functional diversity thompson et al 2017 torsvik et al 2002 and are essential regulators of global biogeochemical cycles ecosystem productivity and climate change birrer et al 2019 cavicchioli et al 2019 wu et al 2019 the genetic structure and function of microbial communities are directly associated with the physical and chemical properties of the environment ruprecht et al 2021 as a result microbial communities are highly sensitive to environmental change broad scale stressors such as wastewater discharge and eutrophication can also significantly alter community evolutionary dynamics as species adapt to novel environmental conditions scheuerl et al 2020 this has potential implications for understanding growth rates associated with essential microbial processes such as bacterial mineralisation nitrification and denitrification which are responsible for the decay of organic material and the removal of excess nitrogen in waterbodies a common problem downstream of effluent outfalls santos et al 2008 further research is needed to integrate knowledge of microbial and nutrient dynamics associated with wastewater impacts to improve waterway management and protect ecosystem integrity importantly bacterial dynamics are rarely included in numerical modelling tools used for broad scale water planning and waterway management in practice nutrient enrichment in aquatic ecosystems is commonly addressed using numerical models to assess changes in water quality including different wastewater impact scenarios özkundakci et al 2011 robson 2014a coupled aquatic ecosystem response models are used to simulate hydrology hydraulics and biogeochemical processes over broad spatial and temporal scales robson 2014b salmon et al 2017 a hydrodynamics approach to managing wastewater impacts in aquatic environments is suitable in instances where there is sufficient volume and flux e g regular tidal exchange short residence times large catchment inflows etc to assimilate nutrient inputs within the system this macro management approach assumes that mixing and dilution processes provide water quality benefits to aquatic ecosystems including a reduction in algal chl a blooms e g bricker et al 2008 davidson et al 2014 while often ignoring the wastewater impacts on bacterial processes and functioning suitable linkages are required between hydrodynamics algae and bacteria in aquatic ecosystem response models to elucidate microbial community and nutrient dynamics in waterways there is increasing evidence that including bacterial dynamics in aquatic ecosystem response models leads to more realistic representation of carbon and nutrient i e n and p mineralisation processes gal et al 2009 li et al 2014a liu et al 2015 however there are relatively few examples of aquatic ecosystem response models that include a microbial loop in part because there have been few integrated studies that provide the necessary information regarding bacterial processes and hydrodynamic model calibration and validation combined field and laboratory ecotoxicology studies that assess microbial dynamics can provide opportunities to better quantify bacterial processes growth kinetics as well as community structure and functional changes in response to wastewater pollution exposure traditionally laboratory microbial ecotoxicological studies have relied on the combination of single species e g individual microalgae toxicity testing and chemical exposure surveys to ascertain the aggregate toxic effect of whole effluent wastewater discharges birrer et al 2017 in recognition of the practical limitations of single species laboratory toxicity testing brandt et al 2004 guckert 1996 ruprecht et al 2020a ruprecht et al 2020b presented a novel combination of microbial community whole effluent toxicity wet testing at a complete range of wastewater effluent concentrations and complimentary genomic tools to provide insights into key bacterial processes this included nutrient and organic matter cycling and the identification of thresholds of community and functional change importantly ruprecht et al 2020a ruprecht et al 2020b also provided high quality pilot ecotoxicological datasets that can be used to explicitly vs implicitly when mechanisms are ignored calculate bacterial dynamics and assess parameter uncertainty in mechanistic aquatic ecosystem response models to validate the inclusion of bacterial dynamics in an aquatic ecosystem response model and enhance its application it is necessary to assess and minimise potential sources of prediction uncertainty that may arise when building more complex models prediction uncertainty in numerical models can arise from three common technical challenges including model structure input data and parameterisation model structure uncertainty is associated with the selection of suitable formulations state variables or processes especially biological that adequately reproduce ecosystem dynamics hipsey et al 2020 mannina and viviani 2009 uncertainty in input data e g field monitoring experimental observations etc from real world biogeochemical processes can arise due to the natural variability in these processes measurement errors and or insufficient data to capture emergent trends parameter uncertainty is confronted during the model calibration process and is typically higher with increasing model parameters i e more complex models while less common in aquatic ecosystem response models e g mannina and viviani 2009 optimisation algorithms such as the generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation glue methodology arhonditsis et al 2008 beven and binley 1992 freer et al 1996 nott et al 2012 ruessink 2006 can account for prediction uncertainty due to parameter variability which is rarely reported simmons et al 2017 to date no other studies link microbial community data from an ecotoxicology laboratory study to improve our understanding of bacterial mineralisation processes in mechanistic aquatic ecosystem response models in this study model performance and uncertainty due to parameter space variability is assessed using the glue methodology combined with monte carlo sampling from uniform prior distributions of individual parameters we identify sensitive model parameters and derive rate values that validate the modelling framework and improve the prediction of microbial community and nutrient dynamic responses to wastewater pollution the outcomes of this study have immediate implications for water quality sampling and testing as well as for improving our

beakers were well mixed with a glass stirring rod and samples from each treatment were taken for further analysis including 1 ml of water for microbial cell counts using flow cytometry and approximately 500 ml of water for dna extraction and sequencing using standard techniques flow cytometry was used to distinguish between total bacterial and algal cell populations in the water samples a 488 nm laser was used for excitation of both syto9 stain total bacteria cells and chlorophyll a total algal cells fluorescence detection targeted bacteria and chlorophyll a using emission filters

were conducted with the water quality model rma 11 version 94 http ikingrma iinet net au rma 11 is a well established process based biogeochemical model that has been applied previously to a range of freshwater and saline systems including lakes rivers estuaries and coastal regions in australia and internationally ezzatti et al 2011 glamore et al 2019 king 2020 primarily as a water management tool the present configuration of rma 11 however is more sophisticated than earlier studies and the water quality model has been expanded to explicitly simulate several functional groups including phytoplankton up to five algal species zooplankton macro and micro species and heterotrophic bacteria as well as carbon nitrogen phosphorus and oxygen dynamics and transport water column algae and nutrient dynamics in rma 11 are replicated in a benthic model which includes sediment water interactions associated with settling and resuspension and dissolved nutrient flux processes rma 11 uses the finite element method to numerically solve the general mass transport equation for each water quality constituent being modelled this equation includes independent effects of constituent mass changes i e growth and decay mixing and transport processes i e advection dispersion dilution and external inputs and losses rma 11 operates on the total biomass concentrations g m3 or mg l of individual water quality constituents and fixed internal redfield stoichiometry redfield et al 1963 across all biological functional groups the net growth rate rslt of each biological constituent is determined by the sum of the growth minus loss terms such that 1 r s l t i μ i ρ i q i p i s i where µi growth ρi respiration qi excretion pi mortality and si settling are the temperature adjusted specific rate

µmax at 20 c and half saturation constants for limiting nutrients e g c n and p each phytoplankton group is subject to additional limitations by light availability and salinity the temperature values computed in rma 11 are used to adjust rate coefficients of the growth and loss terms using the common streeter phelps formulation streeter and phelps 1925 monod growth or the equivalent michaelis menten nutrient kinetics and fixed stoichiometry is the most common approach for simulating resource limited growth in operational water quality models hellweger 2017 the current research version of rma 11 includes a microbial loop where heterotrophic bacteria biomass simulated in terms of carbon mg c l 1 is modelled explicitly allowing dynamic predictions of organic matter mineralisation the role of bacteria in other microbial processes such as nitrification and denitrification are expressed implicitly using bulk conversion rates which are unchanged from earlier versions of rma 11 http ikingrma iinet net au heterotrophic bacteria growth and their ability to mineralise organic matter is assumed to be primarily limited by nutrients from the dissolved organic matter pool encompassing c n and p and is dependant on the oxygen availability in the water column heterotrophic bacteria are not indicators of pathogenic conditions and are modelled separately to coliforms a default preference factor of 0 9 is used to account for heterotrophic bacteria competing with phytoplankton for inorganic nutrients heterotrophic bacteria also produce inorganic nutrients e g co2 nh3 and frp for phytoplankton growth a summary of the equations used in the bacteria sub model of rma 11 is provided in appendix a in this study a depth averaged box model was built based on the design of the community wet tests to represent the microbial and nutrient dynamics observed during the experiment the model was configured to replicate the community wet tests by simulating a beaker as a single element having square dimensions of 0 13 m and an initial water depth of 0 12 m c initial volume of 2 l simulations were run on a timestep of 15 min for a period of 72 h after each 24 h period the water depth in the model was reduced by 0 03 m to simulate a volume loss of approximately 0 5 l due to water sampling the model simulated three separate functional groups of micro zooplankton consumers phytoplankton producers and heterotrophic bacteria decomposers dissolved inorganic nutrients po4 no3 no2 nh3 dic dissolved organic matter doc don dop detrital particulate organic matter poc pon pop as well as dissolved oxygen do and temperature giving a total of 16 water column constituents the benthic model was not activated in these model tests since there were no sediments in the beaker and the focus of this study was on pelagic microbial communities further all settling terms were set to zero as the beaker was stirred after every nominal 24 h period and assumed to be well mixed which justifies using a depth average model an overview of the modelled trophic structure and associated complex series of constituent interactions is provided in fig 2 simulations were initialised using measured nutrient concentrations nh3 nox tkn tn and tp and calculated biomass algae and bacteria data derived from the community wet tests and flow cytometry analysis initial conditions were estimated for other water quality constituents including inorganic nutrients po4 dic and detritus poc pon pop based on the available measured nutrient concentrations and expert opinion micro zooplankton concentrations were estimated based on observed counts nauplii and rotifer sampled from the hunter river estuary during the same study and converted to biomass using typical literature values for average dry body mass robson et al 2018 a summary of the model input data derived from the high 90 effluent concentration treatment in the community wet tests are provided in supplementary table 3 2 3 model validation and assessment the glue methodology uses a likelihood measure s to assign different levels of confidence weighting to different parameter sets reflecting their ability to acceptably reproduce observations of the system dynamics in this application of the glue methodology the performance and hence likelihood measure of each individual parameter set in providing a good fit to the observations was determined using a brier skill score bss the bss is a suitable and commonly used measure of model skill within a glue analysis particularly in coastal simmons et al 2017 van rijn et al 2003 and hydrological freer et al 1996 pappenberger et al 2009 modelling applications the brier skill score is defined as 2 b s s 1 b 0 b m 2 b 0 b b 2 where b 0 is the observed mean bacteria concentration from the community wet tests at time t hrs b m is the final modelled bacteria concentration at time t h and b b is the observed bacteria concentration at time 0 h i e reference point like other likelihood measures a bss value of 1 indicates good agreement of the model predictions with the observed data while a value of 0 indicates no change from the initial condition and less than 0 represents dissimilar behaviour or poor model performance a bss threshold of 0 or greater was applied to the likelihood measure to exclude non behavioural runs from the parameter optimisation analysis this was a suitable assumption because the community wet tests were run over a short period and the addition of wastewater effluent to the beakers stimulated microbial growth from the initial condition after selection of the behavioural runs in each case likelihood values were rescaled so that the cumulative total sum to 1 the weighting assigned to individual behavioural runs were used to calculate posterior distributions of each trialled parameter evaluate the skill of each individual parameter set in reproducing the physical observations and to provide suitable estimates of individual parameter values the likelihood measure l b s s for ith model run is defined as 3 l b s s i b s s i i 1 n b s s i where n is the total number of behavioural runs i e bss 0 and the likelihood is calculated from the skill of each individual behavioural model run b s s i a single likelihood measure was calculated using observed and modelled bacterial biomass data further parameter optimisation analysis was conducted using a combined likelihood measure based on the product of individual likelihood values calculated for bacteria and algae biomasses as determined by 4 c l i 1 n l l b s s i 1 n l where each likelihood value l b s s i of the total number of likelihood measures n l were combined a maximum of 10 000 random monte carlo simulations were used for each application of the glue methodology to define the parameter space parameter values used in the model assessment are given in table 1 initial ranges of the model parameter values were sourced from relevant literature see table 1 footnotes and the recently conducted community wet tests where possible the literature information and modeller experience was used to reduce the dimensions and plausible value range of the parameter space an initial glue analysis considered 28 model parameters across a plausible range of each parameter using continuous uniform prior distributions beven and binley 1992 to maximise the number of behavioural monte carlo simulations this exploratory analysis on the initial parameter space was used to select the most sensitive model calibration parameters and adjust the value ranges for application in a more refined glue analysis a similar approach using a refined glue analysis was conducted by simmons et al 2017 and arhonditsis et al 2008 model parameters excluded from the refined glue analysis were typically taken as the average literature value following application of the glue methodology model performance of the selected calibration parameter set was assessed based on visual inspection of time series plots of simulated and observed data along with a number of quantitative measures five statistical coefficients were considered including coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe of efficiency nse percentage bias bias root mean squared error rmse and the ratio of rmse to the standard deviation rmse std the uncertainty bounds of the predicted output likelihood weighted distribution was also calculated using the 95 confidence percentiles further details on the statistical correlation values are provided in appendix b 3 results 3 1 sensitivity testing glue analysis identified sensitive model rate parameters that improved the prediction of microbial community responses to wastewater pollution revealing new insights for modelling and key drivers of heterotrophic bacterial community growth at affected sites fig 3 shows the general model sensitivity to the top five trialled parameters for the initial and refined value ranges as provided in table 1 in predicting the observed bacterial dynamics in the community wet tests i e a single measure of model performance an initial glue analysis conducted on 10 000 simulations and 28 model parameters revealed the top five most sensitive parameters this is shown by the difference between the cumulative likelihoods and uniform distributions and the kolmogorov smirnov d statistic values ranging from 0 to 1 with a d value of 1 characterising a more sensitive parameter from highest to lowest the five most sensitive parameters were hbac grw hbac hs carb hbac doc exc hbac nmort and hbac rsp all other parameters tested in the initial glue analysis were relatively insensitive to predicting bacterial dynamics in the model with calculated kolmogorov smirnov d statistic values less than 0 04 not shown in fig 3 approximately 30 of the total model runs in the initial glue analysis were determined to be behavioural i e bss 0 with the majority of the behavioural runs 95 showing strong dependence on the maximum bacterial growth rate parameter between values of 0 6 and 1 4 fig 3 after further interrogation of the initial parameter sensitivity a refined glue analysis comprised an additional 10 000 simulations and varied only the initial top five trialled parameters within reduced ranges particularly the maximum bacterial growth rate the refined glue analysis was constrained based on a prior uniform distribution of the net growth rate calculated in eq 1 of heterotrophic bacteria from approximately 0 5 to 0 9 model sensitivity to the maximum bacterial growth rate can be seen again fig 3 however the results of the refined value ranges reveal the relative insensitivity of the model to all other individual rate parameters 3 2 parameter optimisation the refined glue analysis revealed that the best results i e bins with higher likelihood weighted density for predicting bacterial dynamics are obtained when the specific rate parameters of heterotrophic bacteria are set to values that optimise the net growth rate in the model fig 4 provides the likelihood weighted posterior distributions for the net growth and specific loss rate parameters of heterotrophic bacteria based on the refined value ranges provided in table 1 the posterior distributions of the net growth and loss rate terms reveal a more detailed understanding of parameter sensitivity with greater than 90 of the total model runs deemed behavioural compared to the initial glue analysis higher likelihood values occur when the net growth rate of heterotrophic bacteria is in the range from 0 55 to 0 75 which is greater than the average literature value of 0 15 table 1 the results indicate the model is relatively insensitive to the three bacterial loss terms i e respiration excretion and mortality rate parameters in the refined value ranges with small localised peaks in the posterior distribution response surfaces so that no single global optimum parameter set could be easily identified in addition the range in the top 1 likelihood values or parameter sets blue shaded region in fig 4 encompasses the entire value ranges of the trialled individual loss terms while the top 0 1 likelihood values x symbols in fig 4 show less spread for all parameters and offer some guidance to modellers for selecting parameter values for individual loss terms the results shown in fig 4 highlight the potential limitations of using only one constituent i e bacteria biomass to assess model performance and to differentiate between the skill of all parameter sets investigated individual parameters were modestly optimised when likelihood measures were combined for both bacteria and algae to find the most generally reliable calibrated parameter sets fig 5 provides the combined likelihood weighted posterior distributions for the same parameters previously discussed as well as the calculated maximum growth and net loss rates the maximum growth rate of heterotrophic bacteria indicate a higher combined likelihood at higher values ranging from approximately 1 0 to 1 25 when compared to average literature values of approximately 1 0 the results indicate the net growth rate of heterotrophic bacteria is dominated by the maximum growth rate selected value 1 1 the selected value for specific rate parameters of heterotrophic bacteria is the highest combined likelihood value determined by the refined glue analysis 1 15 with lesser influence from the net loss rate selected value1 0 57 which is comprised of several bacterial loss terms i e respiration mortality and excretion the respiration and excretion rates show higher combined likelihood at lower values compared to average literature values of 0 23 and 0 7 respectively indicating that the model performs better for both bacteria and algae when bacterial losses are reduced the statistical findings provide greater confidence when selecting rate values for respiration selected value1 0 08 and excretion selected value1 0 19 due to the reduced ranges in the top 1 and 0 1 likelihood values fig 5 despite the model being insensitive to the natural mortality rate of heterotrophic bacteria the net loss rate can be used to calculate a mortality rate selected value1 0 30 which is higher than the average literature value for this rate parameter table 1 the combination of the selected specific rate parameters values of heterotrophic bacteria result in a net growth rate equal to 0 58 3 3 uncertainty analysis and model validation the implications of parameter induced uncertainty on model performance in predicting heterotrophic bacteria and photo autotrophic algae was examined using the top 1 of behavioural likelihood values determined by applying the glue method the results of the top 1 of behavioural likelihood values are shown in fig 6 for two calculated independent measures of model performance fig 6 reveals that the model has reasonable skill for both the single and combined likelihood measures in reproducing the observed increases in biomass of the two microbial communities fig 6 shows the top 1 of parameter sets predicted a narrower concentration range for the single likelihood measure compared to the combined likelihood measure against the mean observed bacterial concentrations in the community wet tests after 72 h however the reverse relationship is true for the mean observed algal concentrations after 72 h to provide further insight of parameter induced uncertainty on model performance the selected values for the specific rate parameters of heterotrophic bacteria are plotted against the modelled range of behavioural runs and the observed data range in fig 7 this indicates that the mean modelled concentrations were generally in close agreement with the mean observed concentrations after 48 h however the total behavioural model runs predicted a wide concentration range after 72 h with a large number of the behavioural runs predicting almost no change in the bacterial community while the parameter uncertainty bounds 95 confidence for the behavioural runs were relatively narrow there is evidence of epistemic errors i e errors related to input data and or model formulation as the uncertainty bounds do not encompass the observed average bacterial community dynamics in the community wet tests despite the presence of these errors the best modelled concentration profile provides a relatively good fit to the observed data indicating the benefit of using combined likelihood measures to identify a reliable set of individual parameter values for application in aquatic ecosystem response models to further validate the model framework and the selected values for the specific rate parameters of heterotrophic bacteria results of an extended 21 day simulation are provided in supplementary fig 1 the extended duration simulation model was configured with a static water level i e no change in volume to illustrate model stability in reaching mass equilibrium supplementary fig 1 shows heterotrophic bacteria biomass reaches a peak concentration on day 6 and stabilises after day 12 the results illustrate that a positive net growth rate of 0 58 applied in this model does not lead to unconstrained growth in heterotrophic bacteria the model results for predicting heterotrophic bacteria across the full range of effluent concentrations i e 0 to 90 in the community wet tests are provided in supplementary fig 2 the same selected parameter values derived for the 90 effluent concentration treatment were applied to all other modelled effluent concentrations in each model run initial concentrations were varied for all water quality constituents in line with observed data except for particulate organic carbon dissolved organic and inorganic carbon and micro zooplankton because there was no observed data supplementary fig 2 shows the bacteria model generally captures the growth patterns in the observed heterotrophic bacteria counts from the community wet tests while there was high variability across the full range of effluent concentrations the model performed the best r2 0 91 in the 90 effluent concentration treatment case 4 discussion integrated studies are necessary to provide the valuable information needed to improve operational management tools such as mechanistic aquatic ecosystem response models that serve to align catchment water planning and decision making with community values e g swimming fishing etc a central goal of current waterway management strategies this study used unique data derived from a recent laboratory ecotoxicology study ruprecht et al 2021 ruprecht et al 2020a ruprecht et al 2020b linking pressure stressor response relationships in riverine microbial communities to wastewater impacts to validate the inclusion of a microbial loop in a well established aquatic ecosystem response model the generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation glue methodology combined with a simple monte carlo sampling scheme was applied to a depth averaged box model to assess model performance and parameter induced uncertainty compared to the laboratory ecotoxicology data it was found that the generic model has reasonable predictive skill for heterotrophic bacteria dynamics after validating the model against observed data across the full range of effluent concentrations i e 0 0 1 1 10 50 and 90 effluents in the community wet tests this study has implications towards evidence based parameterisation of aquatic ecosystem response models robson et al 2018 and real world modelling applications around the common practice of wastewater discharge to waterways and eutrophication the major premise of the glue methodology is to find behavioural simulations derived from a large number of independent parameter sets influenced by the chosen likelihood measure used to assess model performance against the observed data ratto et al 2001 to improve the reliability of the results obtained from the glue analysis it is often advantageous for modellers to use a combined likelihood measure when compared to a single likelihood to assess model performance by pooling available data e g arhonditsis et al 2008 simmons et al 2017 in this study we demonstrated that a single likelihood measure suited heterotrophic bacteria better than algae whereas when a combined likelihood measure was used the model fit to heterotrophic bacteria was compromised and modestly improved for algae cf fig 6 while the results showed more spread in the model prediction of heterotrophic bacteria using a combined likelihood measure adding an additional constituent i e algae data improved the optimisation of individual bacterial rate parameters which were previously insensitive using a single likelihood measure a combined likelihood measure should also increase confidence in the model validation as more constituents used in the calibration process typically increases the generic predictive capability of a model hellweger 2017 robson et al 2018 our results validated the selection of individual bacterial rate parameter values within the upper and lower bounds of the top 1 of behavioural combined likelihood values which provided a reasonably good fit to the observed microbial and nutrient dynamics in the community wet tests cf supplementary fig 2 the glue analysis illustrates the difficulty in calibrating mechanistic aquatic ecosystem response models which are relatively insensitive to the individual rate parameters e g natural heterotrophic bacteria mortality however using a combined likelihood measure enables modellers to gain a better understanding of the represented processes and the sometimes difficult trade offs required to establish values for these parameters this study reveals that the differences in the time varying response of functional group s and or individual species employed in mechanistic aquatic ecosystem response models are predominantly controlled by their net growth rates providing new insights for model calibration the net growth rate is determined in every aquatic ecosystem response model by the sum of the growth minus the loss terms cf eq 1 such that a positive net growth rate would result in an increase in abundance or biomass i e growth loss whereas a negative net growth rate results in biological decay i e growth loss in rma 11 and like most operational aquatic ecosystem response models the sensitivity of the net growth rate can be adjusted by changing the nutrient limitations applied through the michaelis menten nutrient kinetics and half saturation constants traditional model calibration approaches have focused on adjusting specific rate parameters of individual functional groups within plausible value ranges typically sourced from local observations or peer reviewed literature by trial and error manual calibration hipsey et al 2020 or occasionally through optimisation algorithms such as the glue approach applied in this study robson et al 2018 in practice studies documenting model calibration of aquatic biota such as phytoplankton arhonditsis et al 2008 robson and hamilton 2004 and heterotrophic bacteria gal et al 2009 li et al 2014a liu et al 2015 have ignored any discussion regarding the net effects of combining growth and loss terms on system dynamics or in constraining parameter prior distributions the net growth rate of heterotrophic bacteria from empirical literature growth and loss rate parameter values widely ranged from 1 0 to 0 7 cf table 1 in this study the final calibrated net growth rate parameter value of heterotrophic bacteria determined using the refined glue analysis was selected to be 0 58 cf section 3 2 which is significantly greater than the average literature value of 0 15 in this study if the negative average net growth rate value from the literature was applied in the water quality model this would create misleading results and an unsatisfactory conclusion for the model calibration and validation process this finding underscores the need for caution when modellers attempt to a priori assemble a consistent set of values for individual rate parameters without a fundamental process understanding of the aquatic ecosystem response model and its formulations particularly since there are relatively few available empirical measurements in the literature relevant to some modelled biogeochemical processes e g heterotrophic bacteria loss rates in recognising that the prior distributions of the individual rate parameters are not independent of each other as often thought e g arhonditsis et al 2008 but that they are directly related through an inherent net growth rate governed by the model formulation the model validation and parameter optimisation processes were improved the novel application of community level ecotoxicology data used to validate the inclusion of bacterial mineralisation processes within an aquatic ecosystem response model framework represents a significant advancement over previous modelling studies that have investigated the role of bacterial dynamics in addressing the eutrophication problem it is widely acknowledged that every water quality model has some degree of structural error because they are usually representing aggregate processes based on a conceptual understanding of the real system hipsey et al 2020 robson et al 2018 while the beaker model is a finite system the community wet tests have relevance to real world conditions and in this application provides new insights into understanding the importance of bacterial mineralisation in the parameterisation of mechanistic aquatic ecosystem response models as previously discussed it is often difficult to find relevant parameter values in the literature and this issue is compounded by incorrectly assigning the role of bacteria in the mineralisation of dissolved organic matter dom to fixed rate parameters that may compensate for missing functionality in a general form this can be demonstrated by comparing the dom mineralisation rates of a more conventional approach fixed rate conversion with the monod formulation used in this study fig 8 where bacterial activity is a linear function of concentration a typical average value for fixed bulk mineralisation rates grouped for c n and p sourced from relevant literature is approximately 0 1 day cf table 1 for references our work suggests that typical fixed bulk mineralisation rates found in the literature are higher than realistically required for typical microbial and nutrient concentrations in high bacterial growth situations such as blooms individual mineralisation rates can vary by an order of magnitude as demonstrated from applying fig 8 to the modelling results in supplementary fig 1 while fixed mineralisation rates may produce good model predictions in some circumstances it reduces i the connection between models and the processes they represent ii the predictive capability of the model and iii the ability to anticipate circumstances in which these models may fail kruk et al 2011 ramin et al 2011 robson et al 2018 further the more we try to include a better representation of system functionality e g bacterial traits and processes the better we can expect our aquatic ecosystem response models to perform 5 conclusion integrated multi disciplinary studies that elucidate microbial and nutrient dynamics associated with gradients in environmental stressors such as widespread wastewater pollution are necessary to improve waterway management and protect ecosystem integrity this study used the generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation glue methodology to present a novel link between microbial community ecotoxicology laboratory data and a mechanistic aquatic ecosystem response model it was revealed that a better understanding of the represented processes can be developed using a combined likelihood measure that increases confidence in the predictive capability of the model this requires trade offs on individual likelihoods to establish individual rate parameter values we have shown that i net growth rates of the biological components are of key importance when calibrating aquatic ecosystem response models ii behavioural model results require rate parameter values outside the typical literature ranges reported in table 1 and iii explicitly including bacterial mineralisation in water quality models removes the need for fixed bulk rate parameter values and improves representation of microbial ecosystem functioning this study suggests that improved data collection and modelling efforts in real world management applications are needed to better address nutrients released into the natural environment future studies should aim to better understand the sensitivity of aquatic ecosystem response models to bacterial mineralisation rates credit authorship

16392,global production and use of plastics have resulted in the wide dissemination of micro and nano plastics mnps to the natural environment potentially acting as a vector the role of mnps on the fate and transport of environmental pollutants e g antibiotics such as chlortetracycline hydrochloride ctc has garnered global concern recently herein the cotransport of mnps and ctc in columns packed with uncoated sand or soil colloid coated sand sccs under different degrees of physicochemical heterogeneity and ionic strength was systematically explored our results show that mnps and ctc inhibit the transport of each other when they coexist the adsorption of ctc onto sand grains soil colloids and mnps as well as the aggregation of mnps in the presence of ctc could be the major contributors to the enhanced retention of ctc and mnps in sccs with different degrees of soil colloid coating the adsorption of ctc on soil colloids is critical to influence the transport of ctc and the nonlinear retention of mnps to soil colloids is mainly attributed to the alteration of collector surface roughness by soil colloids high ionic strength slightly facilitates ctc transport due to the competition for adsorption sites and the formation of ctc macromolecules but significantly inhibits mnps transport by suppressing the electrostatic double layers based on colloid stability theory consequently the cotransport of mnps and ctc is governed by the coupled interplay of collector surface roughness and chemical heterogeneity due to the soil colloid coatings and the adsorbed ctc on the surfaces associated with solution chemistries such as ionic strength increased cotransport of mnps and ctc occurred under a higher concentration of mnps due to a larger number of adsorption sites for ctc our findings advance the current understanding of the complex cotransport of mnps and antibiotics in the environment this information is valuable for understanding contaminant fate and formulating strategies for environmental remediation due to the contamination of mnps and co occurring contaminants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords micro and nano plastics chlortetracycline

they occur ubiquitously in the natural environment lebreton et al 2019 projections show that the amount of plastics in agricultural soils transferred from wastewater treatment plants with biosolids is significantly larger than the current total burden millions of tons of plastics in ocean waters nizzetto et al 2016 crossman et al 2020 the main sources of bulk plastics and microplastics entering agricultural soils include the application of plastic films land use of sludge surface runoff and sewage irrigation zhang et al 2019 it is difficult to completely remove these plastics from soils due to the gradual fragmentation of larger plastics into mnps da costa et al 2016 due to their abundance high stability and high mobility mnps may act as carriers for environmental pollutants van sebille et al 2015 zhang et al 2016a potentially promoting the dissemination of pollutants and thus enlarging contaminated regions in the environment ma et al 2016 sleight et al 2017 previous studies indicated that the presence of contaminants such as heavy metals polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon e g naphthalene and tetracycline may influence mnps transport because of competitive adsorption or charge shielding effect hu et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 yao et al 2022 meanwhile the potential cotransport of mnps with these contaminants may occur due to the effective adsorption sites of mnps for contaminants depending on mnps size mixtures ratio and other environmental factors such as solution chemistry ionic strength and ph nevertheless previous studies on the cotransport of mnps with contaminants commonly considered their transport in pure quartz sand and showed strong mobility and weak sensitivity to the environmental factors e g ionic strength chlortetracycline hydrochloride ctc is one of the tetracycline antibiotics which has been widely used in the prevention of diseases due to its broad spectrum and strong antibacterial antiprotozoal activities along with low cost garcía et al 2020 saxena et al 2021 additionally as a typical tetracycline the adverse impact of ctc is greater than oxytetracycline hcl and tetracycline hcl daghrir and drogui 2013 ctc is resistant to digestion after ingestion thus most of them are discharged into the environment in the form of active drugs with feces and urine pärnänen et al 2016 sanderson et al 2016 the overuse of ctc will

fate and potential risks to groundwater safety naturally occurring soil colloids can significantly modify the physical and chemical heterogeneities of soil grains thus highly affecting the transport of solutes and pollutants zhang et al 2012 liang et al 2021 natural soil colloids have been shown to promote inhibit or marginally affect the transport of engineered colloids because of the altered interaction energy zhang et al 2012 liang et al 2021 additionally due to the unique physicochemical properties e g large specific surface area and cation exchange capacity high surface energy and the presence of functional groups on the surface soil colloids can adsorb large amounts of organics or heavy metals on the surfaces ngueleu et al 2013 mathews 2017 consequently the presence of soil colloids will influence the transport behaviors of both mnps and the co existing contaminants therefore the role of soil colloids should not be neglected when investigating the fate of contaminants in the natural environment however to date there is no study reporting the effects of physicochemical heterogeneities from soil colloids on the cotransport of mnps or other engineered micro and nanoparticles with other contaminants herein we aim to investigate the cotransport of mnps and ctc in porous media in the presence of soil colloid coatings with different fractions to the best of our knowledge we are the first to explore the mechanisms that control the cotransport of mnps with ctc the potential adsorption cotransport behaviors and their association with soil colloids these are the key knowledge gaps controlling the fate transport and remediation of mnps and co occurring contaminants in the subsurface environment findings in this study provide valuable insights into understanding and predicting the fate and interaction of mnps and ctc in the natural environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 porous media mnps and solution chemistries quartz sand sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china was used as the model porous media trace amounts of impurities such as metal oxides on the sand surfaces were removed by purification treatments briefly the sand was firstly soaked in 65 hno3 for 24 h and then washed by water until the solution ph was above 6 subsequently the sand was soaked in 10 h2o2 for another 24 h followed by washing in water and ultrasonication for at least 2 h in a sonication bath to remove the colloidal impurities such as silica nanoparticles on the sand surface finally the sand was dried in an oven at 60 c and then sieved using mesh sizes between 350 and 600 µm for later use the quartz and soil colloid sizes were determined using a laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 3000 malvern panalytical u k their bet surface areas were determined by nitrogen adsorption on the surface area analyzer mcmurtic instruments u s to investigate the influence of the attached soil colloids on transport behaviors soil colloids were used to coat the quartz surface using the similar method reported previously scheidegger et al 1993 zhang et al 2016b the natural soil colloids were extracted from a sandy clay loam soil collected from northeastern china 46 78 n 124 67 e by sieving through a 200 mesh nylon sieve the total organic matter toc content of this soil was 2 0 g kg 1 this information has been reported in our recent study liang et al 2021 briefly a certain amount of soil colloids was added to 10 mm kno3 solution and the solution ph was adjusted to 2 5 by hno3 the soil colloid suspension was then shaken at 200 rpm min 1 for 24 h at room temperature after that purified and sieved quartz sands were added to the soil colloid suspension the solid liquid w v ratio was fixed at 1 1 for each mixture and the ratios of soil colloid sand were 0 1 1 200 1 100 1 50 and 1 10 respectively this mixture was followed by shaking in a thermostatic water bath oscillator at 200 rpm min 1 and 70 c for 24 h afterward soil colloid coated sand sccs was soaked into 100 mm kno3 solution to remove the soil colloids that were weakly adhered to the sand grains finally the coated sand was rinsed with deionized water until the supernatant of the washing solution was clear and was then dried in an oven at 50 c characterization of uncoated sand and sccs were provided in section 1 in the supporting information including surface chemical analysis the contents of al fe ca mg and mn quartz fraction and zeta potential carboxylated polystyrene microspheres with particle sizes of 2 μm and 100 nm tianjin saiqun technology co ltd china were chosen as model mnps note that 2 µm mnps were used for batch adsorption experiments release and pre equilibrium experiments to overcome the difficulty in the separation of free ctc and the mnps associated ctc whereas 100 nm mnps were used for other transport and cotransport experiments the mnps suspensions for each experiment were freshly prepared by diluting a raw concentrated suspension into a series of background electrolyte solutions containing 0 1 10 50 or 100 mm nacl to obtain the working concentrations of 5 10 20 and 50 mg l 1 respectively the prepared suspensions were ultrasonicated to prevent aggregation before use chlortetracycline hydrochloride ctc was purchased from shanghai macklin biochemical co china its chemical structure is presented in fig s1 stock ctc solution with 1 g l 1 was prepared and diluted to selected concentrations in nacl solutions for batch and column experiments the ph of the solutions was not adjusted and the values were measured at around 6 5 our preliminary tests on the absorption of ctc using a uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific tm evolution 300 u s did not fluctuate significantly within 7 days so the solution was considered stable with no significant degradation during column experiments the zeta potentials of mnps and quartz sand and the and hydrodynamic diameters d p of mnps under different experimental solution chemistries were determined using zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk scanning electron microscope sem zeiss sigma 300 germany visually characterized the interactions of mnps and the interacting sand surfaces the concentrations of mnps were detected by fluorescence spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength at 488 nm and an emission wavelength at 518 nm and the concentrations of ctc were detected using uv vis spectrophotometer with a fixed wavelength of 366 nm using calibration curves respectively 2 2 batch experiments a series of batch experiments were performed to study the adsorption of ctc on quartz sand 2 μm mnps or soil colloids to investigate the potential adsorption in batch kinetic adsorption experiments ctc solution 20 mg l 1 was mixed with quartz sand 100 g l 1 soil colloids suspension 2 g l 1 or mnps 10 mg l 1 respectively to prepare different mixtures of liquid solid the mixtures containing 1 mm nacl background electrolyte were shaken in a water bath oscillator at 180 rpm and 25 c after 0 25 0 5 1 2 6 12 and 24 h of equilibration the mixtures were centrifuged at 5000 rpm min 1 for 10 min and the ctc concentrations in the supernatants were measured by the uv vis spectrophotometer to determine the adsorption equilibrium time adsorption isotherms were performed by mixing different concentrations of ctc final concentration ranged from 2 5 to 50 mg l 1 with fixed concentrations of quartz sand 100 g l 1 soil colloid suspension 2 g l 1 or mnps 10 mg l 1 respectively for 24 h under the same conditions and methods as kinetic adsorption experiments shown above all adsorption experiments were performed in triplicate for each condition control experiments ctc only were also conducted for each set of the batch experiments 2 3 column experiments water saturated column experiments were carried out in stainless steel columns 3 cm in inner diameter 12 cm in length columns wet packed by quartz sand with without soil colloid coatings were maintained under saturated conditions and the porosity of each column was gravimetrically determined a peristaltic pump was used to introduce the background electrolyte solution tracer ctc solution or mnps suspension single system or ctc mnps mixture binary system at a constant darcy flow rate of 0 7 cm min 1 using an up flow mode the packed columns were firstly conditioned by the introduction of at least 30 pore volumes pvs of the background electrolyte solution 0 1 10 50 or 100 mm nacl at ph 6 5 during conditioning the effluent was only slightly turbid in the first pv so the loss of soil colloids was not significant the tracer experiments were carried out by pulse injection of 100 ml of nacl solution with different concentrations i e 2 5 25 100 or 150 mm the release of soil colloids was found to be negligible after pre conditioning of the column or in the tracer experiments through turbidity and uv vis absorbance measurements the quantification of tracer in the effluent was evaluated by conductivity seifert and engesgaard 2007 after tracer experiments 100 ml of ctc mnps 100 nm or their mixture under different solution chemistries was injected into the column followed by elution with several pvs of background solution the mnps suspension was constantly stirred using a magnetic stirrer during pulse injection a fraction collector was used to continuously collect the effluent samples and the concentrations of ctc and mnps were detected by uv vis spectrophotometer and fluorescence spectrophotometer respectively experimental conditions are shown in table s1 to further unravel the mechanisms of the interactions the release of the retained ctc mnps 2 μm from uncoated sand under 1 mm nacl and ph 6 5 were investigated in the reduced ionic strength phase i and increased solution ph phase ii these release phases were conducted to investigate the detachment of ctc mnps from diffusion and the reduction or elimination of the primary and secondary minima the column was rinsed with 160 ml ultrapure water under ph 6 5 in phase i and 200 ml ultra pure water under ph 10 in phase ii to investigate the potential adsorption cotransport of ctc and mnps ctc concentrations in samples collected by the fraction collector from release phases were divided into two halves and determined after different treatments e g determined without any treatment total released ctc and after centrifugation at 5000 rpm min 1 for 10 min to remove the portion of mnps attached ctc ctc concentrations obtained from these two treatments were then used to evaluate the cotransport of ctc and mnps ctc adsorbed mnps in addition ctc adsorption on mnps surfaces and mnps aggregation with time may influence the transport of mnps additional column experiments were performed after 24 h of adsorption equilibration that ensures a stable state of the ctc mnps mixture in these pre equilibrium experiments ctc and mnps were first mixed for 24 h and then injected into the columns other protocols were consistent with the experimental procedures in column studies shown above 2 4 adsorption and transport models pseudo first order ho and mckay 1998a and pseudo second order kinetic models ho and mckay 1998b were used to fit the adsorption kinetics linear model and freundlich adsorption model freundlich 1906 were employed to describe the adsorption isotherms values of the equilibrium adsorption capacity q e1 and q e2 for the adsorption of ctc by different adsorbents pseudo first order k 1 and second order kinetic rate constant k 2 freundlich constant k f the favorability degree of the adsorption process n and linear adsorption coefficients k l were calculated by fitting the results of batch adsorption experiments details on the model simulations were provided in section s2 in supporting information the transport of mnps and ctc was numerically solved by the nonlinear least squares fitting routine coded in the hydrus 1d simunek et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 liang et al 2019 the modeling approach is also described in detail in the section 2 of supporting information values of the porosity θ bulk density ρ darcy velocity q and dispersivity λ were obtained from experimental information and the fitting of tracer for mnps both the blocking and ripening phenomena were considered the retention rate coefficient k sw and the normalized maximum solid phase concentration of deposited mnps s max c o were obtained by optimization to breakthrough curves btcs of mnps for ctc the fraction of exchange sites assumed to be in equilibrium with the solution phase f the partition coefficient for linear adsorption k d and the first order rate constant ω were obtained by optimization to the btcs of ctc 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of mnps and porous media table s2 provides the hydrodynamic diameter d p of mnps 100 nm and the zeta potentials of mnps quartz sand and soil colloids under different solution chemistries at ph 6 5 the zeta potentials of mnps and quartz sand increased became less negatively charged from 49 77 0 98 to 30 28 3 47 mv and from 73 54 0 90 to 23 30 3 17 mv fig s2 respectively when solution ionic strength increased from 0 to 100 mm nacl similarly with increasing ionic strength the d p of mnps increased from 180 66 52 00 nm to 301 91 5 25 nm when the ph of deionized water was increased from 6 5 to 10 the d p and zeta potential of mnps became more negative due to the weaker charge shielding and protonation of the particle surface torkzaban and bradford 2016 in the presence of ctc the zeta potentials of mnps were much less negative under all of the selected ionic strengths and their sizes increased significantly table s2 e g from 262 25 3 63 nm without ctc to 1116 56 216 72 nm with 20 mg l 1 ctc under 10 mm and ph 6 5 this indicates a tendency of aggregation because of the weaker electrostatic repulsion between mnps sem images show the dispersed mnps figs 1 and 2 and the interactions between mnps and their retention sites in the presence absence of ctc under different experimental conditions especially sem images show that mnps are susceptible to aggregate in the presence of ctc this trend is consistent with the results measured by zetasizer table s2 fig s2 this observation further demonstrated that the existence of ctc destabilizes mnps the alteration of the surface morphology of sand surfaces in the presence of soil colloids was also demonstrated by the sem images fig 1 soil colloids loaded on a relatively smooth surface could form random protuberances leading to increased surface roughness and the produce of more potential retention sites however when a larger number of soil colloids coated the sand surface the large scale e g microscale valley areas on the sand surface become shallower and a thin layer of soil colloids was produced instead of the previous numerous rough locations that randomly loaded on the smooth area therefore the surface roughness of the grain surface would be reduced the d 10 d 50 and d 90 of the quartz sand and soil colloids were 370 500 and 698 µm and 14 51 and 93 µm respectively the bet surface areas of quartz sands betquartz sand and soil colloids betsoil colloid were 0 07 m2 g 1 and 25 45 m2 g 1 respectively table s3 summarizes the chemical analysis of the soil colloids and sccs under different modification ratios by soil colloids the amounts of elements on the surface of uncoated sand and sccs generally increased with the increasing fraction of soil colloid coatings specifically the contents of al fe and mg elements that represent the major metals of soil colloids increased when the fraction of soil colloid coating was increased from 0 1 to 1 10 it should be noted that although the mass ratios of the soil colloids used in sand modification were high only small fractions were able to be attached to the quartz surface supported by the determination of quartz content in the sccs table s3 the porosity of the packed column ranges from 0 412 to 0 441 table s1 indicating that the treatment with soil colloids has an insignificant influence on the pore volumes the tracer experiments demonstrated that the column packing was homogeneous and there was no preferential flow in the pore network fig s3 3 2 adsorption of ctc on quartz sand soil colloids and mnps adsorption kinetics of ctc fig 3 a c on quartz sand soil colloids and mnps can be well described by the pseudo second order kinetic model compared with the pseudo first order kinetic model see r 2 values in table s4 this suggests that chemical adsorption of ctc may occur on these adsorbents liang et al 2022 and the adsorption of ctc was mainly affected by the number and activity of adsorption sites on adsorbent surfaces the adsorption of ctc on mnps and soil colloids reached equilibrium at around 5 h and the equilibrium time was slightly shorter than that on the quartz sand fig 3a c nonetheless the q e value equilibrium absorption capacity of ctc onto mnps was 121 558 mg g 1 which was much larger than the soil colloids and quartz sand table s4 this indicates a greater degree of active sites on mnps for ctc adsorption the high adsorption capacity of mnps was also reported previously for naphthalene hu et al 2020 a large number of ctc molecules can adhere to the adsorbent surface and move along the radial direction due to low diffusion resistance liang et al 2022 the freundlich model r2 0 939 0 990 provided a better simulation for the experimental data than that of the linear model r2 0 708 0 972 fig 3d f and table s4 especially for the adsorption on mnps the freundlich model has also been documented to well describe the adsorption of ctc on agricultural soils conde cid et al 2020 the high r 2 values from the freundlich model imply the heterogeneous adsorption surfaces of the mnps for ctc and the importance of the chemical adsorption conde cid et al 2020 liang et al 2022 soil colloids and mnps showed more than 2 and 4 orders of magnitude higher k f values adsorption equilibrium constant than that on quartz sand table s4 this is mainly due to the larger differences in adsorption affinities and bet specific surface areas e g the betquartz sand versus betsoil colloid was 0 07 m2 g 1 versus 25 45 m2 g 1 respectively the betmnps calculated via the diameter of the mnps 2 μm was 2 86 m2 g 1 which is also higher than that for quartz sand the much larger betsoil colloid was attributed to the rough surface of the grains and the inner pores in soil grains that consist of soil colloid aggregates the intraparticle diffusion thus may play a role in the interactions of ctc with soil colloids liang et al 2022 the strong affinities of mnps for ctc adsorption can be due to the complexations and polarity interactions with carboxylic functional groups on mnps surfaces hydrogen bonding and π π interactions xu et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 the adsorption of ctc on quartz sand can be affected by the non electrostatic interaction of hydrogen bonding between the amide group of ctc and the silanol group of silica kang et al 2012 however the adsorption capacity of quartz was low due to the limited number of active sites on quartz surfaces low specific surface area these observations imply the potential of adsorption cotransport of ctc with mnps and the strong influence of soil colloids during ctc mnps transport in the subsurface environment these will be further explored below via column experiments 3 3 effect of input concentration on transport the transport behaviors of ctc and mnps with different input concentrations from 5 to 50 mg l 1 under ionic strength of 1 mm in uncoated sand columns were investigated and the btcs are presented in figs 4 and s4a the mobility of both ctc and mnps was enhanced with an increase in input concentration when the input concentrations increased from 5 10 20 to 50 mg l 1 the mass recoveries of ctc in the effluent were 57 9 67 7 76 9 and 92 6 table s1 respectively the stronger mobility of ctc at a higher input concentration was mainly attributed to less availability of adsorption sites that were occupied gradually by the injected ctc thus the adsorbed ctc in porous media resulted in the resistance of further ctc retention from the flow furthermore the steeper increasing trend of the plateau in btcs of ctc especially under a lower input concentration indicates the rapid filling of active sites during pulse application and that these sites are filled faster with a higher input concentration similarly in the case of mnps under the same experimental conditions mass recoveries in column effluent also increased from 47 3 to 96 0 with the increasing input concentrations fig 4b the increasing trend of the plateau for all mnps btcs indicates a blocking effect an increasing trend of transport with continuous input that reduces the retention due to the occupation of mnps on the retention sites and the increased repulsive force camesano and logan 1998 zhang et al 2010 which might arise from the electrostatic repulsion between mnps the btcs of mnps and ctc were well described by the numerical simulations the fitted curves were shown in fig 4 and the parameters were summarized in tables s5 and s6 values of k d decrease with increasing co input concentration suggesting the importance of the equilibrium adsorption for ctc under low co the fitted fraction of equilibrium exchange sites f was always very small indicating that the adsorption of ctc was a kinetic process the values of k sw and s max co decrease with increasing co these findings further suggest that repulsion between mobile in the flow and retained mnps enhances transport and that the s max can be filled more rapidly under a larger mass of mnps presence in the system 3 4 effect of mass fraction of soil colloids on transport 3 4 1 transport of ctc mnps in single systems as shown in figs 5 a and s4b the transport of ctc was significantly inhibited and the recoveries in the effluent were systematically reduced as the mass ratio of soil colloids increased in sccs mass recoveries of ctc in the effluent were 76 9 55 9 36 2 13 9 and 6 3 table s1 with different proportions of soil colloids m soil colloid m quartz sand 0 1 1 200 1 100 1 50 and 1 10 respectively the enhanced retention was attributed to the adsorption of ctc by soil colloids which is supported by the results of the batch adsorption experiment fig 3e the btcs also demonstrated that a very small amount of soil colloids can significantly increase the retention of ctc additionally the mobility of ctc is linearly related to the mass of soil colloids on the surfaces different from the transport of ctc the transport of mnps in sccs does not display linear relation but a nonmonotonic effect to the increase in soil colloid mass figs 5b and s4b the presence of soil colloids can change the surface roughness and chemical heterogeneity of sand surfaces zhang et al 2012 liang et al 2021 the increased surface roughness for sccs is illustrated by the sem images figs 1 and 2 the chemical analysis results of grain surfaces al fe ca mg and mn contents table s3 suggest the presence of metal oxides or hydroxides that bring positively charged sites at micro or nanoscale on the negatively charged quartz surface the charge difference and chemical heterogeneity are also supported by the zeta potential measurements e g soil colloids are much less negatively charged compared to the quartz sands table s2 generally the increase in soil colloid fraction in the porous media will increase mnps retention due to the following reasons 1 the affinity of mnps on soil colloids is higher than that on sand grains via interactions with various functional groups on the surface of soil colloids this is also supported by the larger adsorption capacity from soil colloids compared to sand table s4 thus enhanced mnps retention would be expected when more soil colloids were coated on the sand grain surface 2 the increase in charge heterogeneity of the sccs surfaces will also promote retention bradford and torkzaban 2013 bradford et al 2018 however our experimental results figs 5b and s4b contradict with these expectations e g when the mass fractions of soil colloids were 0 1 1 200 1 100 1 50 and 1 10 mass recoveries of mnps collected in the column effluent were nonmonotonically changed as 59 6 50 0 44 9 72 5 and 87 5 table s1 respectively the roughness of the collector surface has been demonstrated to dominate over the charge and hydrophobicity heterogeneity on the transport of colloids bradford et al 2017 2018 shen et al 2018 therefore the changes in physical heterogeneity that alters the interaction energy provide a plausible explanation for our experimental observations bradford and torkzaban 2013 shen et al 2018 in particular as discussed in section 3 1 the coating of soil colloids under a certain amount may create rough locations such as convex sites on a relatively smooth surface this alteration on collector surface roughness will likely reduce or eliminate the energy barrier e g on the nanoscale locations of random protuberances that are created by the attached soil colloids the repulsive energy barriers are lowered or eliminated shen et al 2011 bradford et al 2021 liang et al 2021 thus reduces the transport of mnps in contrast when sufficient colloids are attached and a thin layer is produced on a surface the grain surface roughness can be reduced because the concave areas are preferentially filled therefore the transport of mnps can be enhanced compared with uncoated sand if the larger mass fraction of soil colloids on sand grains reaches a threshold value fig s4b depending on the roughness properties of the retention sites and the relative size of the particles stoll et al 2016 torkzaban and bradford 2016 consequently the nonmonotonic retention of mnps is highly associated with the alteration of collector surface roughness that strongly influences the interaction energy suresh and walz 1996 torkzaban and bradford 2016 furthermore the diagrams fig 5b also indicate the blocking effect of the btcs for mnps and this can also be explained by the rate at which a limited number of retention sites are filled 3 4 2 cotransport of ctc with mnps in binary systems to investigate the cotransport of ctc and mnps the pulse injection was performed using a mixture of ctc and mnps under ionic strength of 1 mm in the presence of mnps the mobility of ctc is also linearly related to the mass ratio of soil colloids in sccs figs 5c and s4b but slightly decreases compared to the single systems without mnps figs 5a and s4b in uncoated sand for instance the mass recovery of ctc decreased from 76 9 to 67 9 when mnps were added the difference is mainly due to the adsorption of ctc on mnps that causes more retention discussed below in the presence of mnps both the high adsorption capacity of mnps for ctc q e table s4 in batch experiments and the greater k d table s6 indicates that mnps have a strong impact on ctc transport sccs with different proportions of soil colloids again leads to a nonlinear and nonmonotonic retention trend in the influence of mnps mobility in the presence of ctc fig s4b the nonlinear variation of the fitted k sw and s max values for mnps transport is consistent with the fact of the nonmonotonic trend of mnps mobility with increasing mass ratio of soil colloids table s5 however the mobility of mnps under different fractions of soil colloids displays different trends for example the greatest and lowest mnps retention occurred at sccs 1 10 and 1 100 fig 5b respectively in the absence of ctc in contract these occurred at sccs 1 50 and uncoated sand fig 5d respectively in the presence of ctc generally mass recovery of mnps transport without ctc 44 9 87 5 was higher than that with ctc 13 7 70 3 in a given sccs ratio pronounced ripening an increasing trend of retention with continuous mnps input for mnps occurred in sccs in the binary system the larger values of s max c o for mnps transport obtained with the presence of ctc table s5 indicate greater retention capacities for mnps this result was expected because the sand grains and mnps exhibit a weaker electrostatic repulsion in presence of ctc due to less negative surface charge zeta potentials thereby producing more deposition in addition the presence of ctc results in the aggregation of mnps table s2 fig 2 which increases the size of mnps and the potential of physical straining therefore btcs from fig 5b and d are the results due to the coupled effects arising from the enhanced surface roughness chemical heterogeneities of collector surfaces and the aggregation of mnps the greatest retention demonstrated that the agglomeration of mnps and straining were the primary causes for the retention in uncoated soil with ctc the adsorption of ctc on the surfaces of collectors and mnps increases the chemical heterogeneity of the collector surfaces thus also increase retention bradford and torkzaban 2013 the coupled influence of increased mnps size and the collector roughness condition can alter transport behavior because of the sensitivity to particle size e g larger rough locations are more favorable for the retention of larger aggregates than small concave sites stoll et al 2016 3 5 effect of ionic strength on transport the effect of ionic strength on the transport of ctc mnps was investigated in the single and binary systems using uncoated sand as porous media figs 6 and s4c in both injection systems the btcs of ctc at the range of ionic strengths from 0 to 100 mm were slightly different in the single system when the ionic strength increased from 0 to 100 mm the recoveries of ctc in the effluent increased from 76 5 to 90 7 table s1 this may be due to the competition of adsorption sites between na and ctc on the medium surface liang et al 2022 and the formation of macromolecule that results from molecular polymerization under high ionic strength turku et al 2007 the transport of ctc without the presence of mnps fig 6a was also slightly higher than that with mnps fig 6c under all the tested ionic strength due to the potential adsorption of ctc on mnps that were retained inside the column when the ionic strength increases from 0 to 100 mm the maximum c co of mnps dramatically decreases from 99 1 to 2 2 fig 6b in the absence of ctc the retention of mnps in the environment is greatly affected by the ionic strength as summarized in table s2 with the increase of solution ionic strengths the zeta potential of mnps and quartz sand become less negative this will lead to the decrease of energy barrier the increase of secondary or primary minimum and the compressed electrostatic double layer bradford et al 2002 therefore the repulsive interactions between mnps and mnps as well as between mnps and quartz sand are inhibited fig 6d shows the effect of ionic strength on the transport of mnps in the presence of ctc under the dual influence of higher ionic strength and the existence of ctc the retention of mnps in quartz sand was greatly promoted almost 0 the sharp decline of c co after it reached the maximum breakthrough indicated ripening probably due to aggregation and physical straining sem images demonstrate also the significant retention of mnps in the presence of ctc fig 2 it is worth mentioning that under the ionic strength conditions of 0 1 10 and 50 mm the mobility of mnps without ctc was significantly higher than that of transport with ctc fig 6b and d which was consistent with the results discussed previously however when the ionic strength reached 100 mm almost no breakthrough of mnps occurred in the absence of ctc fig 6b while 20 8 of mnps was recovered in the presence of ctc as discussed above a higher ionic strength leads to less adsorption of ctc in the porous media and the presence of ctc tends to enhance the retention of mnps therefore under a high ionic strength the less amount of ctc presents in the porous media produces less retention of mnps the values of k sw and s max table s5 largely reflect the influence of ionic strength the chemical heterogeneity may increase with the increase of ionic strength due to the small electrostatic influence region in the double layer compression torkzaban et al 2008 additionally the adsorption of ctc in the porous media and or mnps tends to increase the chemical heterogeneity leading to an increase in the retention of mnps 3 6 release of ctc and mnps and the potential adsorption cotransport as shown in fig 7 a the presence of 2 μm mnps with concentration increases from 0 10 to 100 mg l 1 the transport of ctc in uncoated sand is significantly inhibited slight decrease of tetracycline transport in the presence of mnps was reported in a previous study zhao et al 2020 the transport of mnps dramatically decreased in the presence of 20 mg l 1 ctc fig 7b the mass recovery of mnps co 10 mg l 1 in the column effluent decreased from 43 2 without ctc to 17 1 with ctc table s1 and the btc shape during the later phase of transport also showed a ripening effect previous studies demonstrated that the sizes of mnps were important on the sorption of contaminants li et al 2019 ma et al 2019 wang et al 2019 the adsorption capacities of different sized mnps for ctc can also be different however the trends observed from the transport of 2 μm mnps are consistent with that obtained in section 3 5 indicating that mnps with sizes of 2 μm and 100 nm show a similar effect in affecting ctc transport in addition a larger portion of 2 μm mnps was retained in the porous media compared to that of 100 nm mnps this can be due to the stronger physical straining for larger mnps aggregates to better understand the interaction mechanisms between ctc mnps and collector surface ctc mnps release experiments were carried out in phase i when the columns were rinsed by ultrapure water with the same ph value as the previous retention phase the release of ctc did not occur and only a very small amount 5 of the retained mnps was released these observations indicate that the retention adsorption of ctc is irreversible and mnps are mainly retained in primary minima and are sufficient to overcome the expansion of the electrostatic double layer under a reduced ionic strength in phase ii when the columns were rinsed with ultrapure water at ph 10 larger fractions of the retained ctc and mnps can be released from the columns the release amounts of ctc and mnps reached about 8 and 7 respectively this may result from the more negative surfaces of mnps and sand under the higher ph table s2 which increases the repulsive interaction additionally due to the influence of surface roughness the detachment barrier decreases when the ph value increases and the colloid trapped in the rough locations are prone to detach under water flow shear force and diffusion shen et al 2018 the effect of ph on ctc release resulted from the amphoteric nature of ctc molecules when the ph is higher than 7 a larger portion of ctc is negatively charged and the sand surface is also dominated by negative charge xu et al 2018 turku et al 2007 therefore the electrostatic repulsion generated weakens the adsorption capacity of quartz sand on ctc to investigate the potential adsorption cotransport of ctc and mnps btcs were obtained by distinguishing the fraction of free ctc and the adsorbed ctc on mnps after the centrifugation of collected samples at 5000 rpm min 1 for 10 min to remove mnps the associated transport of ctcs and mnps was then evaluated by the total ctcs minus the free ctcs in solution determined after centrifugation due to the weak adsorption capacity of 10 mg l 1 mnps for 20 mg l 1ctc fig 3f the adsorption cotransport behavior of ctc with mnps was not pronounced fig 8 a however nearly 10 of ctc transport was associated with mnps in the mixture of 100 mg l 1 mnps and ctc fig 8b due to the increased numbers of adsorption sites additional experiments were performed to investigate the potential influence of pre equilibrium the results fig 8c indicate that the transport of ctc is similar when the adsorption process occurred before or after pulse injection therefore the influence of the adsorption process on ctc transport was neglected 4 conclusion in this study the cotransport of mnps and ctc in water saturated porous media with without soil colloids was investigated the results show that ctc and mnps antagonistically inhibit each other s transport in porous media due to the adsorption of ctc onto mnps leading to the aggregation of mnps the strong adsorption of ctc on soil colloids increases the retention of ctc the alteration of surface roughness caused by soil colloids on mnps transport is nonlinear and non monotonic under high ionic strength the retention of ctc was reduced due to the competition of adsorption and polymerization reaction while retention of mnps was enhanced significantly because of the compression of the double electric layer as above the combination of chemical electrostatic and polarity interactions and physical factors surface roughness and size effect determines the co transport behavior of mnps and ctc our findings are useful for better understanding the interactions of antibiotics plastic particles and porous media in natural systems the observations imply that the transport of colloidal contaminants could be significantly impacted by the coexisting pollutants due to the alteration of their stability additionally our findings also underline that the physicochemical heterogeneities of the solid water interface modified by natural soil colloids and the coexistent compounds can profoundly affect the fate of contaminants in the environments the weathered mnps in the natural environment typically exhibit irregular shapes and complex surface groups therefore different sourced mnps with varying physicochemical properties their cotransport with other environmental contaminants and the coupled effects associated with the surface heterogeneities of the natural porous media are worthy of further investigations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

16392,global production and use of plastics have resulted in the wide dissemination of micro and nano plastics mnps to the natural environment potentially acting as a vector the role of mnps on the fate and transport of environmental pollutants e g antibiotics such as chlortetracycline hydrochloride ctc has garnered global concern recently herein the cotransport of mnps and ctc in columns packed with uncoated sand or soil colloid coated sand sccs under different degrees of physicochemical heterogeneity and ionic strength was systematically explored our results show that mnps and ctc inhibit the transport of each other when they coexist the adsorption of ctc onto sand grains soil colloids and mnps as well as the aggregation of mnps in the presence of ctc could be the major contributors to the enhanced retention of ctc and mnps in sccs with different degrees of soil colloid coating the adsorption of ctc on soil colloids is critical to influence the transport of ctc and the nonlinear retention of mnps to soil colloids is mainly attributed to the alteration of collector surface roughness by soil colloids high ionic strength slightly facilitates ctc transport due to the competition for adsorption sites and the formation of ctc macromolecules but significantly inhibits mnps transport by suppressing the electrostatic double layers based on colloid stability theory consequently the cotransport of mnps and ctc is governed by the coupled interplay of collector surface roughness and chemical heterogeneity due to the soil colloid coatings and the adsorbed ctc on the surfaces associated with solution chemistries such as ionic strength increased cotransport of mnps and ctc occurred under a higher concentration of mnps due to a larger number of adsorption sites for ctc our findings advance the current understanding of the complex cotransport of mnps and antibiotics in the environment this information is valuable for understanding contaminant fate and formulating strategies for environmental remediation due to the contamination of mnps and co occurring contaminants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords micro and nano plastics chlortetracycline hydrochloride natural soil colloid transport porous media 1 introduction micro and nano plastics mnps are listed as one of the new classes of emerging pollutants kutralam muniasamy et al 2021 since they occur ubiquitously in the natural environment lebreton et al 2019 projections show that the amount of plastics in agricultural soils transferred from wastewater treatment plants with biosolids is significantly larger than the current total burden millions of tons of plastics in ocean waters nizzetto et al 2016 crossman et al 2020 the main sources of bulk plastics and microplastics entering agricultural soils include the application of plastic films land use of sludge surface runoff and sewage irrigation zhang et al 2019 it is difficult to completely remove these plastics from soils due to the gradual fragmentation of larger plastics into mnps da costa et al 2016 due to their abundance high stability and high mobility mnps may act as carriers for environmental pollutants van sebille et al 2015 zhang et al 2016a potentially promoting the dissemination of pollutants and thus enlarging contaminated regions in the environment ma et al 2016 sleight et al 2017 previous studies indicated that the presence of contaminants such as heavy metals polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon e g naphthalene and tetracycline may influence mnps transport because of competitive adsorption or charge shielding effect hu et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 yao et al 2022 meanwhile the potential cotransport of mnps with these contaminants may occur due to the effective adsorption sites of mnps for contaminants depending on mnps size mixtures ratio and other environmental factors such as solution chemistry ionic strength and ph nevertheless previous studies on the cotransport of mnps with contaminants commonly considered their transport in pure quartz sand and showed strong mobility and weak sensitivity to the environmental factors e g ionic strength chlortetracycline hydrochloride ctc is one of the tetracycline antibiotics which has been widely used in the prevention of diseases due to its broad spectrum and strong antibacterial antiprotozoal activities along with low cost garcía et al 2020 saxena et al 2021 additionally as a typical tetracycline the adverse impact of ctc is greater than oxytetracycline hcl and tetracycline hcl daghrir and drogui 2013 ctc is resistant to digestion after ingestion thus most of them are discharged into the environment in the form of active drugs with feces and urine pärnänen et al 2016 sanderson et al 2016 the overuse of ctc will inevitably induce biotoxicity to microorganisms and the ecosystem potentially posing the risks of increased resistance genes for bacteria pruden et al 2006 kumar et al 2019 large amounts of antibiotics are detected in soils e g 10 967 mg kg 1 and 2 669 mg kg 1 of ctc have been identified in livestock manure and soil in fujian province and northeast china respectively huang et al 2013 hou et al 2014 nevertheless little information is available on the fate and transport of ctc in the environment understanding the retention and release of ctc is critical to evaluating its environmental fate and potential risks to groundwater safety naturally occurring soil colloids can significantly modify the physical and chemical heterogeneities of soil grains thus highly affecting the transport of solutes and pollutants zhang et al 2012 liang et al 2021 natural soil colloids have been shown to promote inhibit or marginally affect the transport of engineered colloids because of the altered interaction energy zhang et al 2012 liang et al 2021 additionally due to the unique physicochemical properties e g large specific surface area and cation exchange capacity high surface energy and the presence of functional groups on the surface soil colloids can adsorb large amounts of organics or heavy metals on the surfaces ngueleu et al 2013 mathews 2017 consequently the presence of soil colloids will influence the transport behaviors of both mnps and the co existing contaminants therefore the role of soil colloids should not be neglected when investigating the fate of contaminants in the natural environment however to date there is no study reporting the effects of physicochemical heterogeneities from soil colloids on the cotransport of mnps or other engineered micro and nanoparticles with other contaminants herein we aim to investigate the cotransport of mnps and ctc in porous media in the presence of soil colloid coatings with different fractions to the best of our knowledge we are the first to explore the mechanisms that control the cotransport of mnps with ctc the potential adsorption cotransport behaviors and their association with soil colloids these are the key knowledge gaps controlling the fate transport and remediation of mnps and co occurring contaminants in the subsurface environment findings in this study provide valuable insights into understanding and predicting the fate and interaction of mnps and ctc in the natural environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 porous media mnps and solution chemistries quartz sand sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china was used as the model porous media trace amounts of impurities such as metal oxides on the sand surfaces were removed by purification treatments briefly the sand was firstly soaked in 65 hno3 for 24 h and then washed by water until the solution ph was above 6 subsequently the sand was soaked in 10 h2o2 for another 24 h followed by washing in water and ultrasonication for at least 2 h in a sonication bath to remove the colloidal impurities such as silica nanoparticles on the sand surface finally the sand was dried in an oven at 60 c and then sieved using mesh sizes between 350 and 600 µm for later use the quartz and soil colloid sizes were determined using a laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 3000 malvern panalytical u k their bet surface areas were determined by nitrogen adsorption on the surface area analyzer mcmurtic instruments u s to investigate the influence of the attached soil colloids on transport behaviors soil colloids were used to coat the quartz surface using the similar method reported previously scheidegger et al 1993 zhang et al 2016b the natural soil colloids were extracted from a sandy clay loam soil collected from northeastern china 46 78 n 124 67 e by sieving through a 200 mesh nylon sieve the total organic matter toc content of this soil was 2 0 g kg 1 this information has been reported in our recent study liang et al 2021 briefly a certain amount of soil colloids was added to 10 mm kno3 solution and the solution ph was adjusted to 2 5 by hno3 the soil colloid suspension was then shaken at 200 rpm min 1 for 24 h at room temperature after that purified and sieved quartz sands were added to the soil colloid suspension the solid liquid w v ratio was fixed at 1 1 for each mixture and the ratios of soil colloid sand were 0 1 1 200 1 100 1 50 and 1 10 respectively this mixture was followed by shaking in a thermostatic water bath oscillator at 200 rpm min 1 and 70 c for 24 h afterward soil colloid coated sand sccs was soaked into 100 mm kno3 solution to remove the soil colloids that were weakly adhered to the sand grains finally the coated sand was rinsed with deionized water until the supernatant of the washing solution was clear and was then dried in an oven at 50 c characterization of uncoated sand and sccs were provided in section 1 in the supporting information including surface chemical analysis the contents of al fe ca mg and mn quartz fraction and zeta potential carboxylated polystyrene microspheres with particle sizes of 2 μm and 100 nm tianjin saiqun technology co ltd china were chosen as model mnps note that 2 µm mnps were used for batch adsorption experiments release and pre equilibrium experiments to overcome the difficulty in the separation of free ctc and the mnps associated ctc whereas 100 nm mnps were used for other transport and cotransport experiments the mnps suspensions for each experiment were freshly prepared by diluting a raw concentrated suspension into a series of background electrolyte solutions containing 0 1 10 50 or 100 mm nacl to obtain the working concentrations of 5 10 20 and 50 mg l 1 respectively the prepared suspensions were ultrasonicated to prevent aggregation before use chlortetracycline hydrochloride ctc was purchased from shanghai macklin biochemical co china its chemical structure is presented in fig s1 stock ctc solution with 1 g l 1 was prepared and diluted to selected concentrations in nacl solutions for batch and column experiments the ph of the solutions was not adjusted and the values were measured at around 6 5 our preliminary tests on the absorption of ctc using a uv vis spectrophotometer thermo scientific tm evolution 300 u s did not fluctuate significantly within 7 days so the solution was considered stable with no significant degradation during column experiments the zeta potentials of mnps and quartz sand and the and hydrodynamic diameters d p of mnps under different experimental solution chemistries were determined using zetasizer nano zs90 malvern instruments uk scanning electron microscope sem zeiss sigma 300 germany visually characterized the interactions of mnps and the interacting sand surfaces the concentrations of mnps were detected by fluorescence spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength at 488 nm and an emission wavelength at 518 nm and the concentrations of ctc were detected using uv vis spectrophotometer with a fixed wavelength of 366 nm using calibration curves respectively 2 2 batch experiments a series of batch experiments were performed to study the adsorption of ctc on quartz sand 2 μm mnps or soil colloids to investigate the potential adsorption in batch kinetic adsorption experiments ctc solution 20 mg l 1 was mixed with quartz sand 100 g l 1 soil colloids suspension 2 g l 1 or mnps 10 mg l 1 respectively to prepare different mixtures of liquid solid the mixtures containing 1 mm nacl background electrolyte were shaken in a water bath oscillator at 180 rpm and 25 c after 0 25 0 5 1 2 6 12 and 24 h of equilibration the mixtures were centrifuged at 5000 rpm min 1 for 10 min and the ctc concentrations in the supernatants were measured by the uv vis spectrophotometer to determine the adsorption equilibrium time adsorption isotherms were performed by mixing different concentrations of ctc final concentration ranged from 2 5 to 50 mg l 1 with fixed concentrations of quartz sand 100 g l 1 soil colloid suspension 2 g l 1 or mnps 10 mg l 1 respectively for 24 h under the same conditions and methods as kinetic adsorption experiments shown above all adsorption experiments were performed in triplicate for each condition control experiments ctc only were also conducted for each set of the batch experiments 2 3 column experiments water saturated column experiments were carried out in stainless steel columns 3 cm in inner diameter 12 cm in length columns wet packed by quartz sand with without soil colloid coatings were maintained under saturated conditions and the porosity of each column was gravimetrically determined a peristaltic pump was used to introduce the background electrolyte solution tracer ctc solution or mnps suspension single system or ctc mnps mixture binary system at a constant darcy flow rate of 0 7 cm min 1 using an up flow mode the packed columns were firstly conditioned by the introduction of at least 30 pore volumes pvs of the background electrolyte solution 0 1 10 50 or 100 mm nacl at ph 6 5 during conditioning the effluent was only slightly turbid in the first pv so the loss of soil colloids was not significant the tracer experiments were carried out by pulse injection of 100 ml of nacl solution with different concentrations i e 2 5 25 100 or 150 mm the release of soil colloids was found to be negligible after pre conditioning of the column or in the tracer experiments through turbidity and uv vis absorbance measurements the quantification of tracer in the effluent was evaluated by conductivity seifert and engesgaard 2007 after tracer experiments 100 ml of ctc mnps 100 nm or their mixture under different solution chemistries was injected into the column followed by elution with several pvs of background solution the mnps suspension was constantly stirred using a magnetic stirrer during pulse injection a fraction collector was used to continuously collect the effluent samples and the concentrations of ctc and mnps were detected by uv vis spectrophotometer and fluorescence spectrophotometer respectively experimental conditions are shown in table s1 to further unravel the mechanisms of the interactions the release of the retained ctc mnps 2 μm from uncoated sand under 1 mm nacl and ph 6 5 were investigated in the reduced ionic strength phase i and increased solution ph phase ii these release phases were conducted to investigate the detachment of ctc mnps from diffusion and the reduction or elimination of the primary and secondary minima the column was rinsed with 160 ml ultrapure water under ph 6 5 in phase i and 200 ml ultra pure water under ph 10 in phase ii to investigate the potential adsorption cotransport of ctc and mnps ctc concentrations in samples collected by the fraction collector from release phases were divided into two halves and determined after different treatments e g determined without any treatment total released ctc and after centrifugation at 5000 rpm min 1 for 10 min to remove the portion of mnps attached ctc ctc concentrations obtained from these two treatments were then used to evaluate the cotransport of ctc and mnps ctc adsorbed mnps in addition ctc adsorption on mnps surfaces and mnps aggregation with time may influence the transport of mnps additional column experiments were performed after 24 h of adsorption equilibration that ensures a stable state of the ctc mnps mixture in these pre equilibrium experiments ctc and mnps were first mixed for 24 h and then injected into the columns other protocols were consistent with the experimental procedures in column studies shown above 2 4 adsorption and transport models pseudo first order ho and mckay 1998a and pseudo second order kinetic models ho and mckay 1998b were used to fit the adsorption kinetics linear model and freundlich adsorption model freundlich 1906 were employed to describe the adsorption isotherms values of the equilibrium adsorption capacity q e1 and q e2 for the adsorption of ctc by different adsorbents pseudo first order k 1 and second order kinetic rate constant k 2 freundlich constant k f the favorability degree of the adsorption process n and linear adsorption coefficients k l were calculated by fitting the results of batch adsorption experiments details on the model simulations were provided in section s2 in supporting information the transport of mnps and ctc was numerically solved by the nonlinear least squares fitting routine coded in the hydrus 1d simunek et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 liang et al 2019 the modeling approach is also described in detail in the section 2 of supporting information values of the porosity θ bulk density ρ darcy velocity q and dispersivity λ were obtained from experimental information and the fitting of tracer for mnps both the blocking and ripening phenomena were considered the retention rate coefficient k sw and the normalized maximum solid phase concentration of deposited mnps s max c o were obtained by optimization to breakthrough curves btcs of mnps for ctc the fraction of exchange sites assumed to be in equilibrium with the solution phase f the partition coefficient for linear adsorption k d and the first order rate constant ω were obtained by optimization to the btcs of ctc 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of mnps and porous media table s2 provides the hydrodynamic diameter d p of mnps 100 nm and the zeta potentials of mnps quartz sand and soil colloids under different solution chemistries at ph 6 5 the zeta potentials of mnps and quartz sand increased became less negatively charged from 49 77 0 98 to 30 28 3 47 mv and from 73 54 0 90 to 23 30 3 17 mv fig s2 respectively when solution ionic strength increased from 0 to 100 mm nacl similarly with increasing ionic strength the d p of mnps increased from 180 66 52 00 nm to 301 91 5 25 nm when the ph of deionized water was increased from 6 5 to 10 the d p and zeta potential of mnps became more negative due to the weaker charge shielding and protonation of the particle surface torkzaban and bradford 2016 in the presence of ctc the zeta potentials of mnps were much less negative under all of the selected ionic strengths and their sizes increased significantly table s2 e g from 262 25 3 63 nm without ctc to 1116 56 216 72 nm with 20 mg l 1 ctc under 10 mm and ph 6 5 this indicates a tendency of aggregation because of the weaker electrostatic repulsion between mnps sem images show the dispersed mnps figs 1 and 2 and the interactions between mnps and their retention sites in the presence absence of ctc under different experimental conditions especially sem images show that mnps are susceptible to aggregate in the presence of ctc this trend is consistent with the results measured by zetasizer table s2 fig s2 this observation further demonstrated that the existence of ctc destabilizes mnps the alteration of the surface morphology of sand surfaces in the presence of soil colloids was also demonstrated by the sem images fig 1 soil colloids loaded on a relatively smooth surface could form random protuberances leading to increased surface roughness and the produce of more potential retention sites however when a larger number of soil colloids coated the sand surface the large scale e g microscale valley areas on the sand surface become shallower and a thin layer of soil colloids was produced instead of the previous numerous rough locations that randomly loaded on the smooth area therefore the surface roughness of the grain surface would be reduced the d 10 d 50 and d 90 of the quartz sand and soil colloids were 370 500 and 698 µm and 14 51 and 93 µm respectively the bet surface areas of quartz sands betquartz sand and soil colloids betsoil colloid were 0 07 m2 g 1 and 25 45 m2 g 1 respectively table s3 summarizes the chemical analysis of the soil colloids and sccs under different modification ratios by soil colloids the amounts of elements on the surface of uncoated sand and sccs generally increased with the increasing fraction of soil colloid coatings specifically the contents of al fe and mg elements that represent the major metals of soil colloids increased when the fraction of soil colloid coating was increased from 0 1 to 1 10 it should be noted that although the mass ratios of the soil colloids used in sand modification were high only small fractions were able to be attached to the quartz surface supported by the determination of quartz content in the sccs table s3 the porosity of the packed column ranges from 0 412 to 0 441 table s1 indicating that the treatment with soil colloids has an insignificant influence on the pore volumes the tracer experiments demonstrated that the column packing was homogeneous and there was no preferential flow in the pore network fig s3 3 2 adsorption of ctc on quartz sand soil colloids and mnps adsorption kinetics of ctc fig 3 a c on quartz sand soil colloids and mnps can be well described by the pseudo second order kinetic model compared with the pseudo first order kinetic model see r 2 values in table s4 this suggests that chemical adsorption of ctc may occur on these adsorbents liang et al 2022 and the adsorption of ctc was mainly affected by the number and activity of adsorption sites on adsorbent surfaces the adsorption of ctc on mnps and soil colloids reached equilibrium at around 5 h and the equilibrium time was slightly shorter than that on the quartz sand fig 3a c nonetheless the q e value equilibrium absorption capacity of ctc onto mnps was 121 558 mg g 1 which was much larger than the soil colloids and quartz sand table s4 this indicates a greater degree of active sites on mnps for ctc adsorption the high adsorption capacity of mnps was also reported previously for naphthalene hu et al 2020 a large number of ctc molecules can adhere to the adsorbent surface and move along the radial direction due to low diffusion resistance liang et al 2022 the freundlich model r2 0 939 0 990 provided a better simulation for the experimental data than that of the linear model r2 0 708 0 972 fig 3d f and table s4 especially for the adsorption on mnps the freundlich model has also been documented to well describe the adsorption of ctc on agricultural soils conde cid et al 2020 the high r 2 values from the freundlich model imply the heterogeneous adsorption surfaces of the mnps for ctc and the importance of the chemical adsorption conde cid et al 2020 liang et al 2022 soil colloids and mnps showed more than 2 and 4 orders of magnitude higher k f values adsorption equilibrium constant than that on quartz sand table s4 this is mainly due to the larger differences in adsorption affinities and bet specific surface areas e g the betquartz sand versus betsoil colloid was 0 07 m2 g 1 versus 25 45 m2 g 1 respectively the betmnps calculated via the diameter of the mnps 2 μm was 2 86 m2 g 1 which is also higher than that for quartz sand the much larger betsoil colloid was attributed to the rough surface of the grains and the inner pores in soil grains that consist of soil colloid aggregates the intraparticle diffusion thus may play a role in the interactions of ctc with soil colloids liang et al 2022 the strong affinities of mnps for ctc adsorption can be due to the complexations and polarity interactions with carboxylic functional groups on mnps surfaces hydrogen bonding and π π interactions xu et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 the adsorption of ctc on quartz sand can be affected by the non electrostatic interaction of hydrogen bonding between the amide group of ctc and the silanol group of silica kang et al 2012 however the adsorption capacity of quartz was low due to the limited number of active sites on quartz surfaces low specific surface area these observations imply the potential of adsorption cotransport of ctc with mnps and the strong influence of soil colloids during ctc mnps transport in the subsurface environment these will be further explored below via column experiments 3 3 effect of input concentration on transport the transport behaviors of ctc and mnps with different input concentrations from 5 to 50 mg l 1 under ionic strength of 1 mm in uncoated sand columns were investigated and the btcs are presented in figs 4 and s4a the mobility of both ctc and mnps was enhanced with an increase in input concentration when the input concentrations increased from 5 10 20 to 50 mg l 1 the mass recoveries of ctc in the effluent were 57 9 67 7 76 9 and 92 6 table s1 respectively the stronger mobility of ctc at a higher input concentration was mainly attributed to less availability of adsorption sites that were occupied gradually by the injected ctc thus the adsorbed ctc in porous media resulted in the resistance of further ctc retention from the flow furthermore the steeper increasing trend of the plateau in btcs of ctc especially under a lower input concentration indicates the rapid filling of active sites during pulse application and that these sites are filled faster with a higher input concentration similarly in the case of mnps under the same experimental conditions mass recoveries in column effluent also increased from 47 3 to 96 0 with the increasing input concentrations fig 4b the increasing trend of the plateau for all mnps btcs indicates a blocking effect an increasing trend of transport with continuous input that reduces the retention due to the occupation of mnps on the retention sites and the increased repulsive force camesano and logan 1998 zhang et al 2010 which might arise from the electrostatic repulsion between mnps the btcs of mnps and ctc were well described by the numerical simulations the fitted curves were shown in fig 4 and the parameters were summarized in tables s5 and s6 values of k d decrease with increasing co input concentration suggesting the importance of the equilibrium adsorption for ctc under low co the fitted fraction of equilibrium exchange sites f was always very small indicating that the adsorption of ctc was a kinetic process the values of k sw and s max co decrease with increasing co these findings further suggest that repulsion between mobile in the flow and retained mnps enhances transport and that the s max can be filled more rapidly under a larger mass of mnps presence in the system 3 4 effect of mass fraction of soil colloids on transport 3 4 1 transport of ctc mnps in single systems as shown in figs 5 a and s4b the transport of ctc was significantly inhibited and the recoveries in the effluent were systematically reduced as the mass ratio of soil colloids increased in sccs mass recoveries of ctc in the effluent were 76 9 55 9 36 2 13 9 and 6 3 table s1 with different proportions of soil colloids m soil colloid m quartz sand 0 1 1 200 1 100 1 50 and 1 10 respectively the enhanced retention was attributed to the adsorption of ctc by soil colloids which is supported by the results of the batch adsorption experiment fig 3e the btcs also demonstrated that a very small amount of soil colloids can significantly increase the retention of ctc additionally the mobility of ctc is linearly related to the mass of soil colloids on the surfaces different from the transport of ctc the transport of mnps in sccs does not display linear relation but a nonmonotonic effect to the increase in soil colloid mass figs 5b and s4b the presence of soil colloids can change the surface roughness and chemical heterogeneity of sand surfaces zhang et al 2012 liang et al 2021 the increased surface roughness for sccs is illustrated by the sem images figs 1 and 2 the chemical analysis results of grain surfaces al fe ca mg and mn contents table s3 suggest the presence of metal oxides or hydroxides that bring positively charged sites at micro or nanoscale on the negatively charged quartz surface the charge difference and chemical heterogeneity are also supported by the zeta potential measurements e g soil colloids are much less negatively charged compared to the quartz sands table s2 generally the increase in soil colloid fraction in the porous media will increase mnps retention due to the following reasons 1 the affinity of mnps on soil colloids is higher than that on sand grains via interactions with various functional groups on the surface of soil colloids this is also supported by the larger adsorption capacity from soil colloids compared to sand table s4 thus enhanced mnps retention would be expected when more soil colloids were coated on the sand grain surface 2 the increase in charge heterogeneity of the sccs surfaces will also promote retention bradford and torkzaban 2013 bradford et al 2018 however our experimental results figs 5b and s4b contradict with these expectations e g when the mass fractions of soil colloids were 0 1 1 200 1 100 1 50 and 1 10 mass recoveries of mnps collected in the column effluent were nonmonotonically changed as 59 6 50 0 44 9 72 5 and 87 5 table s1 respectively the roughness of the collector surface has been demonstrated to dominate over the charge and hydrophobicity heterogeneity on the transport of colloids bradford et al 2017 2018 shen et al 2018 therefore the changes in physical heterogeneity that alters the interaction energy provide a plausible explanation for our experimental observations bradford and torkzaban 2013 shen et al 2018 in particular as discussed in section 3 1 the coating of soil colloids under a certain amount may create rough locations such as convex sites on a relatively smooth surface this alteration on collector surface roughness will likely reduce or eliminate the energy barrier e g on the nanoscale locations of random protuberances that are created by the attached soil colloids the repulsive energy barriers are lowered or eliminated shen et al 2011 bradford et al 2021 liang et al 2021 thus reduces the transport of mnps in contrast when sufficient colloids are attached and a thin layer is produced on a surface the grain surface roughness can be reduced because the concave areas are preferentially filled therefore the transport of mnps can be enhanced compared with uncoated sand if the larger mass fraction of soil colloids on sand grains reaches a threshold value fig s4b depending on the roughness properties of the retention sites and the relative size of the particles stoll et al 2016 torkzaban and bradford 2016 consequently the nonmonotonic retention of mnps is highly associated with the alteration of collector surface roughness that strongly influences the interaction energy suresh and walz 1996 torkzaban and bradford 2016 furthermore the diagrams fig 5b also indicate the blocking effect of the btcs for mnps and this can also be explained by the rate at which a limited number of retention sites are filled 3 4 2 cotransport of ctc with mnps in binary systems to investigate the cotransport of ctc and mnps the pulse injection was performed using a mixture of ctc and mnps under ionic strength of 1 mm in the presence of mnps the mobility of ctc is also linearly related to the mass ratio of soil colloids in sccs figs 5c and s4b but slightly decreases compared to the single systems without mnps figs 5a and s4b in uncoated sand for instance the mass recovery of ctc decreased from 76 9 to 67 9 when mnps were added the difference is mainly due to the adsorption of ctc on mnps that causes more retention discussed below in the presence of mnps both the high adsorption capacity of mnps for ctc q e table s4 in batch experiments and the greater k d table s6 indicates that mnps have a strong impact on ctc transport sccs with different proportions of soil colloids again leads to a nonlinear and nonmonotonic retention trend in the influence of mnps mobility in the presence of ctc fig s4b the nonlinear variation of the fitted k sw and s max values for mnps transport is consistent with the fact of the nonmonotonic trend of mnps mobility with increasing mass ratio of soil colloids table s5 however the mobility of mnps under different fractions of soil colloids displays different trends for example the greatest and lowest mnps retention occurred at sccs 1 10 and 1 100 fig 5b respectively in the absence of ctc in contract these occurred at sccs 1 50 and uncoated sand fig 5d respectively in the presence of ctc generally mass recovery of mnps transport without ctc 44 9 87 5 was higher than that with ctc 13 7 70 3 in a given sccs ratio pronounced ripening an increasing trend of retention with continuous mnps input for mnps occurred in sccs in the binary system the larger values of s max c o for mnps transport obtained with the presence of ctc table s5 indicate greater retention capacities for mnps this result was expected because the sand grains and mnps exhibit a weaker electrostatic repulsion in presence of ctc due to less negative surface charge zeta potentials thereby producing more deposition in addition the presence of ctc results in the aggregation of mnps table s2 fig 2 which increases the size of mnps and the potential of physical straining therefore btcs from fig 5b and d are the results due to the coupled effects arising from the enhanced surface roughness chemical heterogeneities of collector surfaces and the aggregation of mnps the greatest retention demonstrated that the agglomeration of mnps and straining were the primary causes for the retention in uncoated soil with ctc the adsorption of ctc on the surfaces of collectors and mnps increases the chemical heterogeneity of the collector surfaces thus also increase retention bradford and torkzaban 2013 the coupled influence of increased mnps size and the collector roughness condition can alter transport behavior because of the sensitivity to particle size e g larger rough locations are more favorable for the retention of larger aggregates than small concave sites stoll et al 2016 3 5 effect of ionic strength on transport the effect of ionic strength on the transport of ctc mnps was investigated in the single and binary systems using uncoated sand as porous media figs 6 and s4c in both injection systems the btcs of ctc at the range of ionic strengths from 0 to 100 mm were slightly different in the single system when the ionic strength increased from 0 to 100 mm the recoveries of ctc in the effluent increased from 76 5 to 90 7 table s1 this may be due to the competition of adsorption sites between na and ctc on the medium surface liang et al 2022 and the formation of macromolecule that results from molecular polymerization under high ionic strength turku et al 2007 the transport of ctc without the presence of mnps fig 6a was also slightly higher than that with mnps fig 6c under all the tested ionic strength due to the potential adsorption of ctc on mnps that were retained inside the column when the ionic strength increases from 0 to 100 mm the maximum c co of mnps dramatically decreases from 99 1 to 2 2 fig 6b in the absence of ctc the retention of mnps in the environment is greatly affected by the ionic strength as summarized in table s2 with the increase of solution ionic strengths the zeta potential of mnps and quartz sand become less negative this will lead to the decrease of energy barrier the increase of secondary or primary minimum and the compressed electrostatic double layer bradford et al 2002 therefore the repulsive interactions between mnps and mnps as well as between mnps and quartz sand are inhibited fig 6d shows the effect of ionic strength on the transport of mnps in the presence of ctc under the dual influence of higher ionic strength and the existence of ctc the retention of mnps in quartz sand was greatly promoted almost 0 the sharp decline of c co after it reached the maximum breakthrough indicated ripening probably due to aggregation and physical straining sem images demonstrate also the significant retention of mnps in the presence of ctc fig 2 it is worth mentioning that under the ionic strength conditions of 0 1 10 and 50 mm the mobility of mnps without ctc was significantly higher than that of transport with ctc fig 6b and d which was consistent with the results discussed previously however when the ionic strength reached 100 mm almost no breakthrough of mnps occurred in the absence of ctc fig 6b while 20 8 of mnps was recovered in the presence of ctc as discussed above a higher ionic strength leads to less adsorption of ctc in the porous media and the presence of ctc tends to enhance the retention of mnps therefore under a high ionic strength the less amount of ctc presents in the porous media produces less retention of mnps the values of k sw and s max table s5 largely reflect the influence of ionic strength the chemical heterogeneity may increase with the increase of ionic strength due to the small electrostatic influence region in the double layer compression torkzaban et al 2008 additionally the adsorption of ctc in the porous media and or mnps tends to increase the chemical heterogeneity leading to an increase in the retention of mnps 3 6 release of ctc and mnps and the potential adsorption cotransport as shown in fig 7 a the presence of 2 μm mnps with concentration increases from 0 10 to 100 mg l 1 the transport of ctc in uncoated sand is significantly inhibited slight decrease of tetracycline transport in the presence of mnps was reported in a previous study zhao et al 2020 the transport of mnps dramatically decreased in the presence of 20 mg l 1 ctc fig 7b the mass recovery of mnps co 10 mg l 1 in the column effluent decreased from 43 2 without ctc to 17 1 with ctc table s1 and the btc shape during the later phase of transport also showed a ripening effect previous studies demonstrated that the sizes of mnps were important on the sorption of contaminants li et al 2019 ma et al 2019 wang et al 2019 the adsorption capacities of different sized mnps for ctc can also be different however the trends observed from the transport of 2 μm mnps are consistent with that obtained in section 3 5 indicating that mnps with sizes of 2 μm and 100 nm show a similar effect in affecting ctc transport in addition a larger portion of 2 μm mnps was retained in the porous media compared to that of 100 nm mnps this can be due to the stronger physical straining for larger mnps aggregates to better understand the interaction mechanisms between ctc mnps and collector surface ctc mnps release experiments were carried out in phase i when the columns were rinsed by ultrapure water with the same ph value as the previous retention phase the release of ctc did not occur and only a very small amount 5 of the retained mnps was released these observations indicate that the retention adsorption of ctc is irreversible and mnps are mainly retained in primary minima and are sufficient to overcome the expansion of the electrostatic double layer under a reduced ionic strength in phase ii when the columns were rinsed with ultrapure water at ph 10 larger fractions of the retained ctc and mnps can be released from the columns the release amounts of ctc and mnps reached about 8 and 7 respectively this may result from the more negative surfaces of mnps and sand under the higher ph table s2 which increases the repulsive interaction additionally due to the influence of surface roughness the detachment barrier decreases when the ph value increases and the colloid trapped in the rough locations are prone to detach under water flow shear force and diffusion shen et al 2018 the effect of ph on ctc release resulted from the amphoteric nature of ctc molecules when the ph is higher than 7 a larger portion of ctc is negatively charged and the sand surface is also dominated by negative charge xu et al 2018 turku et al 2007 therefore the electrostatic repulsion generated weakens the adsorption capacity of quartz sand on ctc to investigate the potential adsorption cotransport of ctc and mnps btcs were obtained by distinguishing the fraction of free ctc and the adsorbed ctc on mnps after the centrifugation of collected samples at 5000 rpm min 1 for 10 min to remove mnps the associated transport of ctcs and mnps was then evaluated by the total ctcs minus the free ctcs in solution determined after centrifugation due to the weak adsorption capacity of 10 mg l 1 mnps for 20 mg l 1ctc fig 3f the adsorption cotransport behavior of ctc with mnps was not pronounced fig 8 a however nearly 10 of ctc transport was associated with mnps in the mixture of 100 mg l 1 mnps and ctc fig 8b due to the increased numbers of adsorption sites additional experiments were performed to investigate the potential influence of pre equilibrium the results fig 8c indicate that the transport of ctc is similar when the adsorption process occurred before or after pulse injection therefore the influence of the adsorption process on ctc transport was neglected 4 conclusion in this study the cotransport of mnps and ctc in water saturated porous media with without soil colloids was investigated the results show that ctc and mnps antagonistically inhibit each other s transport in porous media due to the adsorption of ctc onto mnps leading to the aggregation of mnps the strong adsorption of ctc on soil colloids increases the retention of ctc the alteration of surface roughness caused by soil colloids on mnps transport is nonlinear and non monotonic under high ionic strength the retention of ctc was reduced due to the competition of adsorption and polymerization reaction while retention of mnps was enhanced significantly because of the compression of the double electric layer as above the combination of chemical electrostatic and polarity interactions and physical factors surface roughness and size effect determines the co transport behavior of mnps and ctc our findings are useful for better understanding the interactions of antibiotics plastic particles and porous media in natural systems the observations imply that the transport of colloidal contaminants could be significantly impacted by the coexisting pollutants due to the alteration of their stability additionally our findings also underline that the physicochemical heterogeneities of the solid water interface modified by natural soil colloids and the coexistent compounds can profoundly affect the fate of contaminants in the environments the weathered mnps in the natural environment typically exhibit irregular shapes and complex surface groups therefore different sourced mnps with varying physicochemical properties their cotransport with other environmental contaminants and the coupled effects associated with the surface heterogeneities of the natural porous media are worthy of further investigations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

primary amines with molar yields of 61 103 minor products included aldehydes carboxylic acids nitroalkanes nitrite nitrate and ammonia the buffering conditions were important compared to phosphate borate enhanced the reactivity of the amines and shifted the products from nitriles to carbonyls an evaluation of the effect potency of some cyano compounds by an in vitro bioassay for oxidative stress response and cytotoxicity suggested that non halogenated nitriles are unlikely to pose a significant threat because they were only toxic at high concentrations acted as baseline toxicants and did not cause oxidative stress unlike halonitroalkanes or halonitriles the formation of non halogenated nitriles is preferable to the formation of nitroalkanes arising from the ozonation of primary amines other than amino acid n terminals because during chlorination nitriles remain unreactive while nitroalkanes lead to potent halonitroalkanes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ferrate primary amine nitrile kinetic oxidative stress cytotoxicity 1 introduction the fate of nitrogen containing moieties during water treatment has been a research focus since they have been linked to the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps that are far more potent than regulated trihalomethanes or haloacetic acids plewa et al 2008 shah and mitch 2012 among these emerging dbps halo aldehydes and halo nitriles have been shown to be formed upon the chlorination of primary amines r nh3 r nh2 alouini and seux 1987 bond et al 2009 joo and mitch 2007 while dissolved organic nitrogen

neurath et al 1977 sacher et al 1997 but primary amines may also be contained in more complex and unidentified organic structures contaminants such as pharmaceuticals may also contain primary amines e g some β lactams oseltamivir gabapentin which are a major reactive site during oxidative treatment dodd et al 2009 karlesa et al 2014 ra et al 2020 attention must therefore be paid to amine containing moieties especially as drinking water resources are increasingly impaired by nitrogen rich inputs such as wastewater discharges agricultural runoff or algal blooms u s bureau of reclamation and sandia national laboratories 2003 chlorination can be replaced or complemented by other oxidative treatments that can mitigate the formation of regulated or emerging dbps lee et al 2007 rougé et al 2020a and enhance the degradation of micropollutants resistant to chlorine lee et al 2007 lee and von gunten 2010 rougé et al 2020a however counterproductive outcomes can be obtained when using these alternative treatments for instance while preozonation can efficiently mitigate the formation of haloacetonitriles the formation of halonitromethanes is usually enhanced de vera et al 2015 hoigné and bader 1988 rougé et al 2020b this adverse effect of pretreatment can be explained by the oxidation of primary amines to nitroalkanes during preozonation lim et al 2019 which can then be chlorinated during disinfection orvik 1980 it is therefore important to understand the interactions between primary amines and oxidants ferrate fe vi has been considered as an alternative oxidant that can lead to efficient micropollutant abatement in wastewaters lee et al 2005a 2009 as a preoxidant to mitigate dbp formation in drinking water rougé et al 2020b yang et al 2013 and or as a coagulant jiang et al 2001 in addition fe vi does not produce known harmful byproducts such as chlorinated organic compounds from chlorine use chlorite from clo2 use or any significant levels of bromate from o3 use in bromide containing waters gan et al 2019 jiang et al 2016 sedlak and von gunten 2011 however limited information is available on the reaction between fe vi and primary amines previous studies suggested the primary amine as a main or secondary reaction site for fe vi carr et al 1981 karlesa et al 2014 noorhasan et al 2010 zimmermann et al 2012 the proposed reaction pathways consistently involved c n bond breakage and the simultaneous release of ammonia or hydroxylamine however these pathways sometimes lack strong analytical evidence or are incomplete i e not all of the nitrogen is accounted for in the products oxidation of methylamine by fe vi has been shown to form cyanate carr 2008 indicating that amines can retain the c n bond products with a preserved c n bond e g amides nitriles might be formed from the fe vi oxidation of other aliphatic amines with carbon chains longer than methylamine but relevant information is currently unavailable this study aims to better understand the reaction between fe vi and aliphatic primary amines by investigating the reaction kinetics and degradation products of several amines the cytotoxicity and oxidative stress response of nitriles that are the main products were evaluated with the arec32 bioassay for a comparative hazard assessment with other dbps such as halonitroalkanes and halonitriles stalter et al 2016 2 materials

stoichiometry and kinetics stoichiometry experiments showed a fe vi amine stoichiometry of 2 5 1 for all the tested amine compounds at ph 9 4 9 8 fig 1 at fe vi 0 amine 0 ratios higher than 1 5 the stoichiometry tended to increase up to 3 1 at lower ph the fe vi amine stoichiometry could not be measured and may vary especially at ph 7 at which reaction mechanisms significantly change see sections 3 3 and 3 4 during the reaction of amines with excess fe vi good linearity was observed between amine decay and fe vi exposure r2 0 9397 0 9999 table s2 si suggesting that the reaction is first order with respect to both amine and fe vi from the slope of these linear plots the second order rate constants k app were determined for kinetics conducted in borate high valent iron intermediates i e fe v and fe iv may contribute to the amine oxidation in this case the k app therefore represents the apparent second order rate constant of the unselective amine oxidation by multiple ferrate species fe vi fe v fe iv wang et al 2021 zhu et al 2020 the k app could also be determined from the pseudo first order k against amine concentration during the reaction of fe vi with excess amine fig s5 si the obtained k app are summarized in table 1 at ph 8 the reactivity of the aliphatic primary amines in phosphate buffer showed the following order benzylamine 20 6 0 6 m 1s 1 phenethylamine 7 4 0 6 m 1s 1 phenylpropylamine 5 0 0 3 m 1s 1 propylamine methylamine 2 7 0 4 m 1s 1 increasing the ph from 8 to 9 significantly increased the reaction rate for all the amines by a factor of 1 8 2 8 while maintaining the same reactivity ranking table 1 a slight increase in the reaction rate was also observed when the ph was decreased from 8 to 7 for phenethylamine and benzylamine the k app of methylamine and propylamine were not measured at ph 7 due to the combined effect of limited analytical sensitivity and fast fe vi self decay compared to its reaction with methylamine and propylamine in excess of amine the k app were 18 4 0 6 m 1s 1 and 42 3 m 1s 1 for methylamine and phenethylamine respectively at ph 9 which is 2 4 2 6 fold higher than the k app determined in excess fe vi this ratio was consistent with the fe vi amine stoichiometry of 2 5 1 fig 1 the k app of primary amines at ph 8 are similar to those of secondary amines 6 8 m 1s 1 for dimethylamine and higher than that of tertiary amines 0 9 m 1s 1 for trimethylamine but much lower than that of aniline as an aromatic amine 720 m 1s 1 table 1 lee et al 2008 2009 notably the k app determined in excess methylamine was significantly lower than previously reported 18 4 vs 57 m 1s 1 at ph 9 table 1 carr 2008 similar discrepancies have previously been found for dimethylamine and trimethylamine table 1 carr 2008 lee et al 2008 the ph dependency of k app in the studied range is unusual compared to other organic moieties in particular secondary and tertiary amines the reactivity of which decreases with increasing ph due to the decreasing fraction of the more reactive hfeo4 lee et al 2008 species specific rate constants derived from the speciation of the reactants which have been successfully determined for the reaction of many organic compounds with fe vi lee et al 2008 2005a 2009 could not be calculated in the case of primary amines the lack of compliance of amine containing compounds to models derived from amine fe vi speciation has already been observed lee and von gunten 2009 noorhasan et al 2010 and investigations are currently underway to elucidate the case of primary amines unpublished data 3 2 impact of buffer and organic matter on primary amine oxidation kinetics phosphate is commonly used for its good buffering capacity at near neutral ph and for its complexing properties that prevent optical interferences due to fe iii precipitation when directly monitoring fe vi decay bielski 1991 however phosphate may complex high valent iron intermediates i e fe v and fe iv that otherwise could contribute to the oxidation leading to an inhibition of the fe vi oxidation efficiency huang et al 2018 2021 kinetics in excess of fe vi were also conducted in borate buffer in the absence of phosphate at ph 8 and 9 an increase in reaction rate by a factor of 1 2 1 8 was observed when using borate instead of phosphate table 1 recently experimental evidence and kinetic modeling of the reaction between fe vi and abts provided by huang et al suggested that phosphate prevented fe v from reacting leading to an oxidation capacity of fe vi approximately 1 6 1 9 times higher in borate than in phosphate at ph 7 huang et al 2018 a similar inhibitory effect of phosphate on the oxidation of primary amines with high valent iron intermediates may occur and explain the higher k app observed in borate than in phosphate the complete inhibition of fe iv and fe v action during primary amine oxidation in presence of phosphate was confirmed by the negligible impact of caffeine used to quench fe iv and fe v wang et al 2021 on benzylamine oxidation kinetic at ph 7 and 9 10 fig s6 si the k app measured in phosphate therefore represents solely the fe vi contribution while the k app in borate represents the fe iv fe v and fe vi contributions the difference between k app in phosphate and in borate can reveal the contribution of the intermediates fe iv and fe v in the oxidation of primary amines using k app provided in table 1 roughly 60 70 of the contribution was attributed to fe vi and 20 30 to fe iv and fe v with no significant impact of the side group or ph compared to the k app uncertainties see text s3 and fig s7 si the only exception was propylamine at ph 9 for which the calculated fe vi contribution was 84 13 the kinetic differences observed in borate and phosphate demonstrate that buffering conditions used for kinetic measurement must be carefully chosen when studying fe vi on one hand rate constants determined in phosphate are likely to underestimate the abatement of compounds in real waters in which iron intermediates may not be complexed as efficiently and may be produced from fe vi reduction by organic matter huang et al 2021 lee et al 2005a on the other hand rate constants determined in borate potentially overestimate the abatement of compounds in real water in which organic matter may inhibit the action of iron intermediates by reducing and or partially complexing them huang et al 2021 wang et al 2021 a lower reactivity in organic matter compared to phosphate has even been observed for anilines due to according to the authors the quenching of the aniline radicals back to the aniline by organic matter sun et al 2018 kinetic determinations of benzylamine at ph 9 and in presence of organic matter and borate revealed an inhibitory effect of umrnom comparable to that of phosphate in pure water k app 40 3 m 1s 1 fig s8 si the corresponding kinetic determinations conducted in phosphate and in presence of umrnom revealed no impact of organic matter on the reaction rate k app 38 1 m 1s 1 fig s8 si excluding an inhibitory effect of umrnom via the quenching of amine intermediates which was previously suggested for anilines sun et al 2018 in addition carbonate another buffer more relevant to real water matrices was also tested on benzylamine in pure water at ph 9 10 mm carbonate and led to a k app similar to that found in phosphate 41 1 m 1s 1 fig s8 si suggesting an inhibitory effect of carbonate on high valent iron intermediate reactivity further studies are warranted to determine the role of organic matter and other water constituents such as carbonate in the oxidation of amines in real waters 3 3 reaction products and yields the product distribution is shown in fig 2 see fig s9 for data si for benzylamine and in figs s10 s14 for phenethylamine propylamine and methylamine upon fe vi oxidation benzylamine was found to form benzonitrile as a major product in phosphate fig 2 minor products included carbonyls benzaldehyde and benzoic acid nitromethylbenzene nitrite nitrate and ammonia fig 2 the molar yield δ product δ benzylamine 100 of benzonitrile was 90 at ph 9 and decreased to 63 at ph 7 concomitantly carbonyls increased with decreasing ph from 5 at ph 9 to 24 at ph 7 and some nitromethylbenzene was also formed at ph 7 9 following the same trend as the carbonyls inorganic nitrogen yields increased with decreasing ph from 2 at ph 9 to 25 at ph 7 compared to phosphate nitrile formation greatly decreased in borate at ph 8 from 85 to 39 while the carbonyl yields increased from 14 to 41 inorganic nitrogen yields also increased to a similar extent from 16 to 43 while a significant fraction was not characterized 20 at ph 9 no significant difference was observed between phosphate and borate 89 nitrile fig 2 nitrile was also the main product for phenethylamine and propylamine table 2 figs s10 s12 si and carbonyls nitroalkane nitrite and nitrate were also formed from phenethylamine at yields consistent with those observed for benzylamine fig s10 si the oxidation of methylamine in phosphate did not lead to cyanide but to cyanate 90 yield at ph 8 and 9 fig s13a si at ph 7 although methylamine could not be accurately quantified due to interference from potassium originating from fe vi the products shifted toward nitrite and nitrate which represented 38 of the cyanate production fig s14 si formaldehyde was formed along with nitrite nitrate representing 24 of the cyanate production fig s14 si at ph 8 borate greatly decreased cyanate yields from 98 to 60 while increasing nitrite nitrate formation from 2 to 27 fig s13b si 3 4 degradation pathways and mechanisms of primary amines by fe vi based on the identified products and the stoichiometry a general reaction scheme is proposed for the reaction of primary amines with fe vi scheme 1 in the first step fe vi reacts with the primary amine to form either an imine 1 or a hydroxylamine 2 the imine can either further react with fe vi to form a nitrile 3 or be hydrolyzed to an aldehyde 4 and 5 releasing ammonia alouini and seux 1987 the aldehyde can be further oxidized to a carboxylic acid 6 k app 14 m 1s 1 for benzaldehyde at ph 8 and in phosphate see fig s15 si while the oxidation of ammonia k app 1 m 1s 1 for ph 7 in phosphate sharma et al 1998a and of nitrile k app 1 m 1s 1 at ph 8 in phosphate and borate fig s16a si are negligible for extended contact times 1 day the nitrile may self decay depending on its structure while benzonitrile remained stable for 4 days phenylacetonitrile degraded to unidentified products other than phenylacetaldehyde phenylacetic acid benzaldehyde or benzoic acid beyond 1 day fig s16b si the decay of propionitrile after 2 days has also previously been observed joo and mitch 2007 the hydroxylamine formed from the amine 2 is quickly oxidized to a nitroso 7 which can be further oxidized to a nitroalkane 8 johnson and hornstein 1996 2003 the nitroso is in equilibrium with its aldehyde oxime tautomer long et al 2001 which is readily oxidized to aldehyde 9 releasing nitrite see fig s17 si the latter can be further oxidized to nitrate 10 carr et al 2018 the nitroalkane can also be further oxidized to aldehyde 11 fig s18 si the formation of imine has previously been suggested for the oxidation of primary amines by chlorine and permanganate alouini and seux 1987 wei 1965 however for both oxidants imine is not further oxidized to nitrile but only hydrolyzed to aldehyde in the case of chlorine nitrile can be formed but it proceeds via a chlorinated imine pathway alouini and seux 1987 joo and mitch 2007 the dominance of nitrile products at ph 8 observed here suggests that the imine is very reactive toward fe vi or fe v fe iv formed from fe vi reduction although the reaction pathway is unknown the case of methylamine is probably unique among the primary amines due to the lack of substitution on the amine s α carbon carr previously suggested the formation of an imine followed by oxygen transfer to form formamide during fe vi oxidation of methylamine where formamide is further oxidized to cyanate carr 2008 however no cyanate formation was observed from the reaction of formamide 40 80 µm and fe vi 80 480 µm at ph 7 and 9 10 mm phosphate instead the formation of cyanide via pathways 1 and 3 may occur followed by further oxidation to cyanate sharma et al 1998b at ph 8 and 9 cyanide is rapidly oxidized by fe vi k app 315 605 m 1s 1 sharma et al 1998b and does not accumulate sharma et al 1998a the alternative pathway involving n hydroxylation 2 may also occur for methylamine leading to the formation of nitrite nitrate nitromethane might be formed but was not monitored and of formaldehyde at ph 7 fig s14a si n hydroxylation of methylamine has recently been suggested to be favorable based on theoretical calculations baum et al 2021 although according to our product experiments it is not the main reaction pathway cyanate may also be oxidized by fe vi to nitrite nitrate sharma et al 1998b but experiments conducted at ph 7 showed no abatement of cyanate 80 µm by fe vi 160 480 µm fig s14b si dismissing this reaction as a source of nitrite nitrate at this ph the shift in product speciation observed in phosphate with decreasing ph suggests that the oxygen transfer to the amine 2 is favored at lower ph over the imine formation 1 fig 2 and fig s10 si which may be due to the increase of hfeo4 and or protonated amine fraction in the absence of phosphate the shift in product formation observed at ph 8 figs 2 and s10 and s13 si suggests that high valent iron intermediates fe iv and or fe v influence the reaction pathways their involvement was confirmed by the effect of caffeine used as a fe iv fe v quenching agent wang et al 2021 on the product speciation at ph 8 in borate in presence of caffeine nitrile yields from benzylamine increased from 40 to 79 while inorganic nitrogen yields sum of ammonia nitrite and nitrate decreased from 59 to 21 fig s19 si based on the proposed mechanism scheme 1 high valent iron intermediates therefore favor the deamination process 4 and the oxygen transfer to the amine 2 and lead to some unidentified reactions further work is warranted to better understand the role of the speciation of amines and of high valent iron species fe iv fe v and fe vi in the oxidation mechanism of primary amines 3 5 products from amine oxidation in real water the oxidation of amines by 31 125 µm fe vi 1 7 7 mgfe l 1 was tested in a real surface water matrix its characteristics are given in text s1 si without ph adjustment a fe vi dose of 63 µm 3 5 mgfe l 1 could oxidize 35 42 and 72 of methylamine phenethylamine and benzylamine respectively fig s20a si fig 3 shows that in real water the oxidation of primary amines led mainly to nitrile or cyanate for methylamine with a molar yield of 58 at ph 8 and 80 at ph 8 5 by comparison nitrile yields at ph 8 in pure water buffered with borate were lower 39 43 table 2 the partial quenching of fe iv and or fe v by organic matter see section 3 2 and fig s8 si may explain the higher yields in real water however considering the sharp increase in nitrile yields between ph 8 and 9 the difference between real and pure water may also be due to a slightly higher ph in real water up to 8 2 upon fe vi addition fig s2b si in practice fe vi doses significantly higher than 3 5 mgfe l 1 can be used jiang et al 2006 which is expected to oxidize a significant fraction of primary amines to nitriles it is currently unknown whether the formation of non halogenated nitriles is of concern 3 6 toxicity evaluation of nitrile containing products in recent years the potency of low molecular weight halogenated dbps has been intensively studied using in vitro bioassays to better understand the risks that they may pose plewa et al 2008 richardson et al 2007 stalter et al 2016 in particular the oxidative stress response has been a commonly observed effect with 98 of 45 investigated halogenated dbps activating this defense mechanism stalter et al 2016 the potency of non halogenated byproducts such as the nitriles formed in the present work has not yet been studied using these novel bioanalytical tools the inhibitory concentrations for cytotoxicity ic10 and effective concentrations for the oxidative stress response ecir1 5 of a group of non halogenated nitriles are shown in table 3 and fig 4 because of the volatility and low medium air partition coefficients of the nitrile containing structures detected in this work escher et al 2019 only phenylacetonitrile and cyanate although not a nitrile could be included in these bioassays to which 12 other nitrile containing compounds were added table 3 ic10 could be derived for 11 of 14 compounds 3 cyanopropionic acid and 3 oxobutyronitrile precipitated before causing cytotoxicity and cyanoacetic acid did not show any cytotoxicity up to 0 12 m table 3 fig 4 shows the measured log 1 ic10 open diamonds of cyano compounds plotted against their liposome water partition coefficient logk lip w values are given in table s3 si the qsar line plain line in fig 4 represents the baseline toxicity which is the minimum toxicity that every compound is expected to elicit escher et al 2019 if the measured log 1 ic10 of the tested compounds exceeds their qsar predicted log 1 ic10 baseline by one log unit toxic ratio tr 10 they are considered specifically acting or reactive toxicants that may induce toxicity via specific pathways escher et al 2020 this threshold represented by a dotted line in fig 4 was not exceeded by any non halogenated nitrile except 1 cyanocyclohexaneacetic acid tr 21 suggesting that cytotoxicity was merely caused by baseline toxicity 50 of the tested compounds activated the oxidative stress response in the human mcf7 cell based arec32 bioassay table 3 with ecir1 5 ranging between 7 8 10 4 and 9 5 10 3 m both oxidative stress response and cytotoxicity were observed in only 4 compounds cyanate 1 cyanocyclohexaneacetic acid 2 hydroxy 2 phenyl acetonitrile and 4 hydroxybenzylcyanide table 3 oxidative stress response occurred with very low specificity srbaseline and srcytotoxicity both being 10 i e the oxidative stress response was not activated at concentrations significantly lower than the cytotoxicity table s4 si the only exceptions were 3 cyanopropionic acid and 3 oxobutyronitrile with srbaseline of 13 and 44 respectively table s4 si by comparison halomethanes excluding iodo as well as tri and dichloroacetics also exhibited low srbaseline 10 while haloacetonitriles haloacetamides excluding trichloro and dichloro haloketones and halonitromethanes led to an srbaseline of 102 104 table s5 and fig s21 si stalter et al 2016 overall these results suggest that the formation of non halogenated nitriles is unlikely to pose a significant threat because they are of low potency high ic10 and ecir1 5 values and are not specifically acting for cytotoxicity and oxidative stress response unlike many other halogenated dbps stalter et al 2016 however more toxicological studies such as genotoxicity or studies on the impact of metabolic activation are needed to further evaluate the potency of non halogenated nitriles in water 4 conclusions the oxidation of aliphatic primary amines by fe vi is slower than that of phenols or anilines but within the same order as that of olefins or secondary amines high valent iron intermediates are involved in the oxidation but phosphate nom and carbonate can inhibit their contribution to the rate constants therefore aliphatic primary amines need to be considered main or secondary reactive sites in contrast to previously proposed pathways the oxidation of primary amines by fe vi does not necessarily lead to c n breakage bonds except for the shortest amine containing structure methylamine the formation of high yields of nitrile was observed for all studied compounds although high valent iron intermediates were shown to decrease nitrile yields a complete examination of product formation from benzylamine and phenethylamine also showed that minor products included aldehydes carboxylic acids nitroalkanes ammonia and nitrite nitrate formed at increasing yields with decreasing ph to 7 cytotoxicity and oxidative stress response bioassays conducted on 14 different nitrile containing compounds suggested that the formation of non halogenated nitriles is unlikely to be a major concern furthermore during an eventual post disinfection and in absence of strong electron withdrawing side groups such as carboxylic acids nitriles would not be reactive toward chlorine or chloramine joo and mitch 2007 see fig s22 si thus fe vi preoxidation should not enhance halonitrile formation via this pathway which based on haloacetonitrile potency plewa et al 2008 stalter et al 2016 can be of concern some nitroalkanes may be produced at ph 7 but their yields 20 should be low in comparison to o3 preoxidation which is known to produce 100 nitroalkanes from primary amines lim et al 2019 mccurry et al 2016 while the potency of nitroalkanes is unknown post chlorination would lead to the formation of very potent halonitroalkanes due to the acidic nature of carbon α to the nitro group mccurry et al 2016 orvik 1980 by comparison if clo2 is used as a preoxidant primary amines should remain intact and be available to react with chlorine during disinfection forming organic chloramines these chloramines can be stable and their toxicity is currently largely unknown hoigné and bader 1994 joo and mitch 2007 primary amines are notably present in amino acid n terminals which due to the presence of a carboxylic acid group form products other than nitriles unpublished data they are also likely to be contained in complex nom structures and their occurrence is uncertain as there is no analytical method to discriminate between the different forms of organic nitrogen the contribution of primary amine other than amino acid n terminal transformation products to the potency of treated waters is therefore unclear but based on the present work fe vi may be a better option than o3 or chlorine for their oxidation declaration of competing interest the authors

appreciable reactivity toward fe vi 2 7 68 m 1s 1 at ph 7 9 ranking as follows benzylamine phenethylamine phenylpropylamine methylamine propylamine nitriles were the main oxidation products of the primary amines with molar yields of 61 103 minor products included aldehydes carboxylic acids nitroalkanes nitrite nitrate and ammonia the buffering conditions were important compared to phosphate borate enhanced the reactivity of the amines and shifted the products from nitriles to carbonyls an evaluation of the effect potency of some cyano compounds by an in vitro bioassay for oxidative stress response and cytotoxicity suggested that non halogenated nitriles are unlikely to pose a significant threat because they were only toxic at high concentrations acted as baseline toxicants and did not cause oxidative stress unlike halonitroalkanes or halonitriles the formation of non halogenated nitriles is preferable to the formation of nitroalkanes arising from the ozonation of primary amines other than amino acid n terminals because during chlorination nitriles remain unreactive while nitroalkanes lead to potent halonitroalkanes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ferrate primary amine nitrile kinetic oxidative stress cytotoxicity 1 introduction the fate of nitrogen containing moieties during water treatment has been a research focus since they have been linked to the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps that are far more potent than regulated trihalomethanes or haloacetic acids plewa et al 2008 shah and mitch 2012 among these emerging dbps halo aldehydes and halo nitriles have been shown to be formed upon the chlorination of primary amines r nh3 r nh2 alouini and seux 1987 bond et al 2009 joo and mitch 2007 while dissolved organic nitrogen can range from 0 2 to several mgn l 1 dotson and westerhoff 2009 pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2008 westerhoff and mash 2002 the fraction of primary amines is uncertain studies have reported the occurrence of amino acids and sugars chinn and barrett 2000 dotson and westerhoff 2009 or short chain aliphatic structures akyüz and ata 2006 cai et al 2003 farajzadeh and nouri 2013 fu et al 2012 neurath et al 1977 sacher et al 1997 but primary amines may also be contained in more complex and unidentified organic structures contaminants such as pharmaceuticals may also contain primary amines e g some β lactams oseltamivir gabapentin which are a major reactive site during oxidative treatment dodd et al 2009 karlesa et al 2014 ra et al 2020 attention must therefore be paid to amine containing moieties especially as drinking water resources are increasingly impaired by nitrogen rich inputs such as wastewater discharges agricultural runoff or algal blooms u s bureau of reclamation and sandia national laboratories 2003 chlorination can be replaced or complemented by other oxidative treatments that can mitigate the formation of regulated or emerging dbps lee et al 2007 rougé et al 2020a and enhance the degradation of micropollutants resistant to chlorine lee et al 2007 lee and von gunten 2010 rougé et al 2020a however counterproductive outcomes can be obtained when using these alternative treatments for instance while preozonation can efficiently mitigate the formation of haloacetonitriles the formation of halonitromethanes is usually enhanced de vera et al 2015 hoigné and bader 1988 rougé et al 2020b this adverse effect of pretreatment can be explained by the oxidation of primary amines to nitroalkanes during preozonation lim et al 2019 which can then be chlorinated during disinfection orvik 1980 it is therefore important to understand the interactions between primary amines and oxidants ferrate fe vi has been considered as an alternative oxidant that can lead to efficient micropollutant abatement in wastewaters lee et al 2005a 2009 as a preoxidant to mitigate dbp formation in drinking water rougé et al 2020b yang et al 2013 and or as a coagulant jiang et al 2001 in addition fe vi does not produce known harmful byproducts such as chlorinated organic compounds from chlorine use chlorite from clo2 use or any significant levels of bromate from o3 use in bromide containing waters gan et al 2019 jiang et al 2016 sedlak and von gunten 2011 however limited information is available on the reaction between fe vi and primary amines previous studies suggested the primary amine as a main or secondary reaction site for fe vi carr et al 1981 karlesa et al 2014 noorhasan et al 2010 zimmermann et al 2012 the proposed reaction pathways consistently involved c n bond breakage and the simultaneous release of ammonia or hydroxylamine however these pathways sometimes lack strong analytical evidence or are incomplete i e not all of the nitrogen is accounted for in the products oxidation of methylamine by fe vi has been shown to form cyanate carr 2008 indicating that amines can retain the c n bond products with a preserved c n bond e g amides nitriles might be formed from the fe vi oxidation of other aliphatic amines with carbon chains longer than methylamine but relevant information is currently unavailable this study aims to better understand the reaction between fe vi and aliphatic primary amines by investigating the reaction kinetics and degradation products of several amines the cytotoxicity and oxidative stress response of nitriles that are the main products were evaluated with the arec32 bioassay for a comparative hazard assessment with other dbps such as halonitroalkanes and halonitriles stalter et al 2016 2 materials

stoichiometry and kinetics stoichiometry experiments showed a fe vi amine stoichiometry of 2 5 1 for all the tested amine compounds at ph 9 4 9 8 fig 1 at fe vi 0 amine 0 ratios higher than 1 5 the stoichiometry tended to increase up to 3 1 at lower ph the fe vi amine stoichiometry could not be measured and may vary especially at ph 7 at which reaction mechanisms significantly change see sections 3 3 and 3 4 during the reaction of amines with excess fe vi good linearity was observed between amine decay and fe vi exposure r2 0 9397 0 9999 table s2 si suggesting that the reaction is first order with respect to both amine and fe vi from the slope of these linear plots the second order rate constants k app were determined for kinetics conducted in borate high valent iron intermediates i e fe v and fe iv may contribute to the amine oxidation in this case the k app therefore represents the apparent second order rate constant of the unselective amine oxidation by multiple ferrate species fe vi fe v fe iv wang et al 2021 zhu et al 2020 the k app could also be determined from the pseudo first order k against amine concentration during the reaction of fe vi with excess amine fig s5 si the obtained k app are summarized in table 1 at ph 8 the reactivity of the aliphatic primary amines in phosphate buffer showed the following order benzylamine 20 6 0 6 m 1s 1 phenethylamine 7 4 0 6 m 1s 1 phenylpropylamine 5 0 0 3 m 1s 1 propylamine methylamine 2 7 0 4 m 1s 1 increasing the ph from 8 to 9 significantly increased the reaction rate for all the amines by a factor of 1 8 2 8 while maintaining the same reactivity ranking table 1 a slight increase in the reaction rate was also observed when the ph was decreased from 8 to 7 for phenethylamine and benzylamine the k app of methylamine and propylamine were not measured at ph 7 due to the combined effect of limited analytical sensitivity and fast fe vi self decay compared to its reaction with methylamine and propylamine in excess of amine the k app were 18 4 0 6 m 1s 1 and 42 3 m 1s 1 for methylamine and phenethylamine respectively at ph 9 which is 2 4 2 6 fold higher than the k app determined in excess fe vi this ratio was consistent with the fe vi amine stoichiometry of 2 5 1 fig 1 the k app of primary amines at ph 8 are similar to those of secondary amines 6 8 m 1s 1 for dimethylamine and higher than that of tertiary amines 0 9 m 1s 1 for trimethylamine but much lower than that of aniline as an aromatic amine 720 m 1s 1 table 1 lee et al 2008 2009 notably the k app determined in excess methylamine was significantly lower than previously reported 18 4 vs 57 m 1s 1 at ph 9 table 1 carr 2008 similar discrepancies have previously been found for dimethylamine and trimethylamine table 1 carr 2008 lee et al 2008 the ph dependency of k app in the studied range is unusual compared to other organic moieties in particular secondary and tertiary amines the reactivity of which decreases with increasing ph due to the decreasing fraction of the more reactive hfeo4 lee et al 2008 species specific rate constants derived from the speciation of the reactants which have been successfully determined for the reaction of many organic compounds with fe vi lee et al 2008 2005a 2009 could not be calculated in the case of primary amines the lack of compliance of amine containing compounds to models derived from amine fe vi speciation has already been observed lee and von gunten 2009 noorhasan et al 2010 and investigations are currently underway to elucidate the case of primary amines unpublished data 3 2 impact of buffer and organic matter on primary amine oxidation kinetics phosphate is commonly used for its good buffering capacity at near neutral ph and for its complexing properties that prevent optical interferences due to fe iii precipitation when directly monitoring fe vi decay bielski 1991 however phosphate may complex high valent iron intermediates i e fe v and fe iv that otherwise could contribute to the oxidation leading to an inhibition of the fe vi oxidation efficiency huang et al 2018 2021 kinetics in excess of fe vi were also conducted in borate buffer in the absence of phosphate at ph 8 and 9 an increase in reaction rate by a factor of 1 2 1 8 was observed when using borate instead of phosphate table 1 recently experimental evidence and kinetic modeling of the reaction between fe vi and abts provided by huang et al suggested that phosphate prevented fe v from reacting leading to an oxidation capacity of fe vi approximately 1 6 1 9 times higher in borate than in phosphate at ph 7 huang et al 2018 a similar inhibitory effect of phosphate on the oxidation of primary amines with high valent iron intermediates may occur and explain the higher k app observed in borate than in phosphate the complete inhibition of fe iv and fe v action during primary amine oxidation in presence of phosphate was confirmed by the negligible impact of caffeine used to quench fe iv and fe v wang et al 2021 on benzylamine oxidation kinetic at ph 7 and 9 10 fig s6 si the k app measured in phosphate therefore represents solely the fe vi contribution while the k app in borate represents the fe iv fe v and fe vi contributions the difference between k app in phosphate and in borate can reveal the contribution of the intermediates fe iv and fe v in the oxidation of primary amines using k app provided in table 1 roughly 60 70 of the contribution was attributed to fe vi and 20 30 to fe iv and fe v with no significant impact of the side group or ph compared to the k app uncertainties see text s3 and fig s7 si the only exception was propylamine at ph 9 for which the calculated fe vi contribution was 84 13 the kinetic differences observed in borate and phosphate demonstrate that buffering conditions used for kinetic measurement must be carefully chosen when studying fe vi on one hand rate constants determined in phosphate are likely to underestimate the abatement of compounds in real waters in which iron intermediates may not be complexed as efficiently and may be produced from fe vi reduction by organic matter huang et al 2021 lee et al 2005a on the other hand rate constants determined in borate potentially overestimate the abatement of compounds in real water in which organic matter may inhibit the action of iron intermediates by reducing and or partially complexing them huang et al 2021 wang et al 2021 a lower reactivity in organic matter compared to phosphate has even been observed for anilines due to according to the authors the quenching of the aniline radicals back to the aniline by organic matter sun et al 2018 kinetic determinations of benzylamine at ph 9 and in presence of organic matter and borate revealed an inhibitory effect of umrnom comparable to that of phosphate in pure water k app 40 3 m 1s 1 fig s8 si the corresponding kinetic determinations conducted in phosphate and in presence of umrnom revealed no impact of organic matter on the reaction rate k app 38 1 m 1s 1 fig s8 si excluding an inhibitory effect of umrnom via the quenching of amine intermediates which was previously suggested for anilines sun et al 2018 in addition carbonate another buffer more relevant to real water matrices was also tested on benzylamine in pure water at ph 9 10 mm carbonate and led to a k app similar to that found in phosphate 41 1 m 1s 1 fig s8 si suggesting an inhibitory effect of carbonate on high valent iron intermediate reactivity further studies are warranted to determine the role of organic matter and other water constituents such as carbonate in the oxidation of amines in real waters 3 3 reaction products and yields the product distribution is shown in fig 2 see fig s9 for data si for benzylamine and in figs s10 s14 for phenethylamine propylamine and methylamine upon fe vi oxidation benzylamine was found to form benzonitrile as a major product in phosphate fig 2 minor products included carbonyls benzaldehyde and benzoic acid nitromethylbenzene nitrite nitrate and ammonia fig 2 the molar yield δ product δ benzylamine 100 of benzonitrile was 90 at ph 9 and decreased to 63 at ph 7 concomitantly carbonyls increased with decreasing ph from 5 at ph 9 to 24 at ph 7 and some nitromethylbenzene was also formed at ph 7 9 following the same trend as the carbonyls inorganic nitrogen yields increased with decreasing ph from 2 at ph 9 to 25 at ph 7 compared to phosphate nitrile formation greatly decreased in borate at ph 8 from 85 to 39 while the carbonyl yields increased from 14 to 41 inorganic nitrogen yields also increased to a similar extent from 16 to 43 while a significant fraction was not characterized 20 at ph 9 no significant difference was observed between phosphate and borate 89 nitrile fig 2 nitrile was also the main product for phenethylamine and propylamine table 2 figs s10 s12 si and carbonyls nitroalkane nitrite and nitrate were also formed from phenethylamine at yields consistent with those observed for benzylamine fig s10 si the oxidation of methylamine in phosphate did not lead to cyanide but to cyanate 90 yield at ph 8 and 9 fig s13a si at ph 7 although methylamine could not be accurately quantified due to interference from potassium originating from fe vi the products shifted toward nitrite and nitrate which represented 38 of the cyanate production fig s14 si formaldehyde was formed along with nitrite nitrate representing 24 of the cyanate production fig s14 si at ph 8 borate greatly decreased cyanate yields from 98 to 60 while increasing nitrite nitrate formation from 2 to 27 fig s13b si 3 4 degradation pathways and mechanisms of primary amines by fe vi based on the identified products and the stoichiometry a general reaction scheme is proposed for the reaction of primary amines with fe vi scheme 1 in the first step fe vi reacts with the primary amine to form either an imine 1 or a hydroxylamine 2 the imine can either further react with fe vi to form a nitrile 3 or be hydrolyzed to an aldehyde 4 and 5 releasing ammonia alouini and seux 1987 the aldehyde can be further oxidized to a carboxylic acid 6 k app 14 m 1s 1 for benzaldehyde at ph 8 and in phosphate see fig s15 si while the oxidation of ammonia k app 1 m 1s 1 for ph 7 in phosphate sharma et al 1998a and of nitrile k app 1 m 1s 1 at ph 8 in phosphate and borate fig s16a si are negligible for extended contact times 1 day the nitrile may self decay depending on its structure while benzonitrile remained stable for 4 days phenylacetonitrile degraded to unidentified products other than phenylacetaldehyde phenylacetic acid benzaldehyde or benzoic acid beyond 1 day fig s16b si the decay of propionitrile after 2 days has also previously been observed joo and mitch 2007 the hydroxylamine formed from the amine 2 is quickly oxidized to a nitroso 7 which can be further oxidized to a nitroalkane 8 johnson and hornstein 1996 2003 the nitroso is in equilibrium with its aldehyde oxime tautomer long et al 2001 which is readily oxidized to aldehyde 9 releasing nitrite see fig s17 si the latter can be further oxidized to nitrate 10 carr et al 2018 the nitroalkane can also be further oxidized to aldehyde 11 fig s18 si the formation of imine has previously been suggested for the oxidation of primary amines by chlorine and permanganate alouini and seux 1987 wei 1965 however for both oxidants imine is not further oxidized to nitrile but only hydrolyzed to aldehyde in the case of chlorine nitrile can be formed but it proceeds via a chlorinated imine pathway alouini and seux 1987 joo and mitch 2007 the dominance of nitrile products at ph 8 observed here suggests that the imine is very reactive toward fe vi or fe v fe iv formed from fe vi reduction although the reaction pathway is unknown the case of methylamine is probably unique among the primary amines due to the lack of substitution on the amine s α carbon carr previously suggested the formation of an imine followed by oxygen transfer to form formamide during fe vi oxidation of methylamine where formamide is further oxidized to cyanate carr 2008 however no cyanate formation was observed from the reaction of formamide 40 80 µm and fe vi 80 480 µm at ph 7 and 9 10 mm phosphate instead the formation of cyanide via pathways 1 and 3 may occur followed by further oxidation to cyanate sharma et al 1998b at ph 8 and 9 cyanide is rapidly oxidized by fe vi k app 315 605 m 1s 1 sharma et al 1998b and does not accumulate sharma et al 1998a the alternative pathway involving n hydroxylation 2 may also occur for methylamine leading to the formation of nitrite nitrate nitromethane might be formed but was not monitored and of formaldehyde at ph 7 fig s14a si n hydroxylation of methylamine has recently been suggested to be favorable based on theoretical calculations baum et al 2021 although according to our product experiments it is not the main reaction pathway cyanate may also be oxidized by fe vi to nitrite nitrate sharma et al 1998b but experiments conducted at ph 7 showed no abatement of cyanate 80 µm by fe vi 160 480 µm fig s14b si dismissing this reaction as a source of nitrite nitrate at this ph the shift in product speciation observed in phosphate with decreasing ph suggests that the oxygen transfer to the amine 2 is favored at lower ph over the imine formation 1 fig 2 and fig s10 si which may be due to the increase of hfeo4 and or protonated amine fraction in the absence of phosphate the shift in product formation observed at ph 8 figs 2 and s10 and s13 si suggests that high valent iron intermediates fe iv and or fe v influence the reaction pathways their involvement was confirmed by the effect of caffeine used as a fe iv fe v quenching agent wang et al 2021 on the product speciation at ph 8 in borate in presence of caffeine nitrile yields from benzylamine increased from 40 to 79 while inorganic nitrogen yields sum of ammonia nitrite and nitrate decreased from 59 to 21 fig s19 si based on the proposed mechanism scheme 1 high valent iron intermediates therefore favor the deamination process 4 and the oxygen transfer to the amine 2 and lead to some unidentified reactions further work is warranted to better understand the role of the speciation of amines and of high valent iron species fe iv fe v and fe vi in the oxidation mechanism of primary amines 3 5 products from amine oxidation in real water the oxidation of amines by 31 125 µm fe vi 1 7 7 mgfe l 1 was tested in a real surface water matrix its characteristics are given in text s1 si without ph adjustment a fe vi dose of 63 µm 3 5 mgfe l 1 could oxidize 35 42 and 72 of methylamine phenethylamine and benzylamine respectively fig s20a si fig 3 shows that in real water the oxidation of primary amines led mainly to nitrile or cyanate for methylamine with a molar yield of 58 at ph 8 and 80 at ph 8 5 by comparison nitrile yields at ph 8 in pure water buffered with borate were lower 39 43 table 2 the partial quenching of fe iv and or fe v by organic matter see section 3 2 and fig s8 si may explain the higher yields in real water however considering the sharp increase in nitrile yields between ph 8 and 9 the difference between real and pure water may also be due to a slightly higher ph in real water up to 8 2 upon fe vi addition fig s2b si in practice fe vi doses significantly higher than 3 5 mgfe l 1 can be used jiang et al 2006 which is expected to oxidize a significant fraction of primary amines to nitriles it is currently unknown whether the formation of non halogenated nitriles is of concern 3 6 toxicity evaluation of nitrile containing products in recent years the potency of low molecular weight halogenated dbps has been intensively studied using in vitro bioassays to better understand the risks that they may pose plewa et al 2008 richardson et al 2007 stalter et al 2016 in particular the oxidative stress response has been a commonly observed effect with 98 of 45 investigated halogenated dbps activating this defense mechanism stalter et al 2016 the potency of non halogenated byproducts such as the nitriles formed in the present work has not yet been studied using these novel bioanalytical tools the inhibitory concentrations for cytotoxicity ic10 and effective concentrations for the oxidative stress response ecir1 5 of a group of non halogenated nitriles are shown in table 3 and fig 4 because of the volatility and low medium air partition coefficients of the nitrile containing structures detected in this work escher et al 2019 only phenylacetonitrile and cyanate although not a nitrile could be included in these bioassays to which 12 other nitrile containing compounds were added table 3 ic10 could be derived for 11 of 14 compounds 3 cyanopropionic acid and 3 oxobutyronitrile precipitated before causing cytotoxicity and cyanoacetic acid did not show any cytotoxicity up to 0 12 m table 3 fig 4 shows the measured log 1 ic10 open diamonds of cyano compounds plotted against their liposome water partition coefficient logk lip w values are given in table s3 si the qsar line plain line in fig 4 represents the baseline toxicity which is the minimum toxicity that every compound is expected to elicit escher et al 2019 if the measured log 1 ic10 of the tested compounds exceeds their qsar predicted log 1 ic10 baseline by one log unit toxic ratio tr 10 they are considered specifically acting or reactive toxicants that may induce toxicity via specific pathways escher et al 2020 this threshold represented by a dotted line in fig 4 was not exceeded by any non halogenated nitrile except 1 cyanocyclohexaneacetic acid tr 21 suggesting that cytotoxicity was merely caused by baseline toxicity 50 of the tested compounds activated the oxidative stress response in the human mcf7 cell based arec32 bioassay table 3 with ecir1 5 ranging between 7 8 10 4 and 9 5 10 3 m both oxidative stress response and cytotoxicity were observed in only 4 compounds cyanate 1 cyanocyclohexaneacetic acid 2 hydroxy 2 phenyl acetonitrile and 4 hydroxybenzylcyanide table 3 oxidative stress response occurred with very low specificity srbaseline and srcytotoxicity both being 10 i e the oxidative stress response was not activated at concentrations significantly lower than the cytotoxicity table s4 si the only exceptions were 3 cyanopropionic acid and 3 oxobutyronitrile with srbaseline of 13 and 44 respectively table s4 si by comparison halomethanes excluding iodo as well as tri and dichloroacetics also exhibited low srbaseline 10 while haloacetonitriles haloacetamides excluding trichloro and dichloro haloketones and halonitromethanes led to an srbaseline of 102 104 table s5 and fig s21 si stalter et al 2016 overall these results suggest that the formation of non halogenated nitriles is unlikely to pose a significant threat because they are of low potency high ic10 and ecir1 5 values and are not specifically acting for cytotoxicity and oxidative stress response unlike many other halogenated dbps stalter et al 2016 however more toxicological studies such as genotoxicity or studies on the impact of metabolic activation are needed to further evaluate the potency of non halogenated nitriles in water 4 conclusions the oxidation of aliphatic primary amines by fe vi is slower than that of phenols or anilines but within the same order as that of olefins or secondary amines high valent iron intermediates are involved in the oxidation but phosphate nom and carbonate can inhibit their contribution to the rate constants therefore aliphatic primary amines need to be considered main or secondary reactive sites in contrast to previously proposed pathways the oxidation of primary amines by fe vi does not necessarily lead to c n breakage bonds except for the shortest amine containing structure methylamine the formation of high yields of nitrile was observed for all studied compounds although high valent iron intermediates were shown to decrease nitrile yields a complete examination of product formation from benzylamine and phenethylamine also showed that minor products included aldehydes carboxylic acids nitroalkanes ammonia and nitrite nitrate formed at increasing yields with decreasing ph to 7 cytotoxicity and oxidative stress response bioassays conducted on 14 different nitrile containing compounds suggested that the formation of non halogenated nitriles is unlikely to be a major concern furthermore during an eventual post disinfection and in absence of strong electron withdrawing side groups such as carboxylic acids nitriles would not be reactive toward chlorine or chloramine joo and mitch 2007 see fig s22 si thus fe vi preoxidation should not enhance halonitrile formation via this pathway which based on haloacetonitrile potency plewa et al 2008 stalter et al 2016 can be of concern some nitroalkanes may be produced at ph 7 but their yields 20 should be low in comparison to o3 preoxidation which is known to produce 100 nitroalkanes from primary amines lim et al 2019 mccurry et al 2016 while the potency of nitroalkanes is unknown post chlorination would lead to the formation of very potent halonitroalkanes due to the acidic nature of carbon α to the nitro group mccurry et al 2016 orvik 1980 by comparison if clo2 is used as a preoxidant primary amines should remain intact and be available to react with chlorine during disinfection forming organic chloramines these chloramines can be stable and their toxicity is currently largely unknown hoigné and bader 1994 joo and mitch 2007 primary amines are notably present in amino acid n terminals which due to the presence of a carboxylic acid group form products other than nitriles unpublished data they are also likely to be contained in complex nom structures and their occurrence is uncertain as there is no analytical method to discriminate between the different forms of organic nitrogen the contribution of primary amine other than amino acid n terminal transformation products to the potency of treated waters is therefore unclear but based on the present work fe vi may be a better option than o3 or chlorine for their oxidation declaration of competing interest the authors

16394,the carbonate radical co3 and the excited triplet states of chromophoric dissolved organic matter play an important role in the photodegradation of some easily oxidized pollutants in surface waters such as the aromatic amines anilines and sulfadiazine are known to undergo back reduction processes when their degradation is mediated by the excited triplet states of photosensitizers triplet sensitization back reduction which inhibits photodegradation means that phenols or the antioxidant mostly phenolic moieties occurring in the natural dissolved organic matter of surface waters reduce back to the parent compounds the radical species derived from the mono electronic oxidation of anilines and sulfadiazine here we show that a similar process takes place as well in the case of substrate oxidation by co3 the carbonate radical was here produced upon oxidation of hco3 co3 2 by either ho generated by nitrate photolysis or so4 obtained by photolysis of persulfate back reduction was observed in both cases in the presence of phenols but at different extents as far as the details of reaction kinetics are concerned and the occurrence of additional reductants might affect the efficacy by which phenols carry out the reduction process in particular when the carbonate radicals were produced by no3 photolysis in the presence of hco3 co3 2 the numerical values of phoh 1 2 the phenol concentration that halves the photodegradation rate of the substrate were 2 19 0 23 µm for aniline 1 15 0 25 µm for 3 chloroaniline 1 18 0 26 µm for 4 chloroaniline and 1 18 0 22 µm for 3 4 dichloroaniline in contrast when co3 was produced by photolysis of persulfate in the presence of hco3 co3 2 the corresponding values were 0 28 0 02 µm for aniline and 0 79 0 10 µm for sulfadiazine back reduction has the potential to significantly inhibit photodegradation by co3 and excited triplet states in natural waters and to comparatively increase the importance of ho mediated degradation that is not affected by the same phenomenon graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords back reduction aniline phenol excited triplet states photochemistry 1 introduction photochemical reactions are important processes for the degradation of organic contaminants especially biorecalcitrant compounds in sunlit surface waters photoinduced processes consist of the direct photolysis in which the contaminant absorbs sunlight and gets consequently transformed and of indirect phototransformation in the latter absorption of sunlight by photosensitizers such as the chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom nitrate and nitrite yields reactive transient species either directly or upon interaction with the water matrix e g with the inorganic carbon species hco3 and co3 2 these photochemically produced reactive intermediates ppris can react with the contaminants the main ppris are the hydroxyl radical ho the triplet states of cdom 3cdom the singlet oxygen 1o2 and the carbonate radical co3 boreen et al 2003 remucal 2014 vialaton and richard 2002 yan and song 2014 the dissolved organic matter dom and its chromophoric fraction cdom play major roles in the photochemistry of natural surface waters cdom is a direct or indirect source of all the ppris but it is also able to inhibit the direct photolysis processes by competing with the contaminants for sunlight irradiance furthermore the dom is a key scavenger of both ho and co3 vione et al 2014 yan et al 2019 therefore the natural organic matter that occurs in surface waters is able to both inhibit and enhance the phototransformation reactions in addition to ppris scavenging dom can inhibit phototransformation through its antioxidant moieties aos mostly phenolic indeed it has been shown that the reactions between 3cdom and some contaminants especially aromatic amines yield partially oxidized intermediates which can be back reduced to the parent contaminants by dom aos canonica and laubscher 2008 wenk and canonica 2012 this back reduction process does not only affect reactions induced by 3cdom but has recently been shown to occur for the reaction of the sulfate radical so4 with several anilines and sulfonamide antibiotics canonica and schönenberger 2019 as well as for the reaction of co3 with the cyanotoxin cylindrospermopsin hao et al 2020 since co3 is a typical one electron oxidant neta et al 1988 that reacts efficiently with a variety of aromatic amine compounds canonica et al 2005 huang and mabury 2000a 2000b it is expected that such compounds are on the one hand significantly oxidized by co3 in the aquatic environment and experience on the other hand back reduction by dom aos interestingly occurrence of back reduction has not been observed in the case of ho which undergoes addition to aromatic rings more easily than one electron oxidation or h atom abstraction wenk et al 2011 the present study has the goal of detecting and quantifying back reduction by two phenols used as dom aos surrogates in the reactions of co3 with several anilines and the sulfonamide antibiotic sulfadiazine the oxidation of hco3 co3 2 to co3 by strongly oxidizing radicals was carried out through two alternative methods huang and mabury 2000a neta et al 1988 the first method is the photolysis of nitrate to yield ho mack and bolton 1999 and the second is the photolysis of persulfate s2o8 2 to form so4 criquet and leitner 2009 in addition the effect of phenol on the transformation of two anilines photosensitized by a model aromatic ketone as a cdom surrogate was also assessed with the purpose of comparing the extent of back reduction among different oxidation reactions 2 materials and methods the list of used chemicals is reported in text s1 of the supplementary material hereinafter sm the main issue with the production of co3 is that this radical is generated by oxidation of hco3 co3 2 therefore the production of co3 requires a stronger oxidant than co3 itself which may however be able to compete with co3 for the degradation processes great care is thus to be taken to define the operational conditions so that the chosen oxidant species is almost exclusively involved in the oxidation of inorganic carbon while the generated co3 reacts preferentially with the target substrate s in this work two methods were used and compared for the generation of co3 i oxidation by ho produced by nitrate photolysis and ii oxidation by so4 produced by photolysis of persulfate s2o8 2 2 1 formation of the carbonate radical co3 by nitrate photolysis the co3 radicals were produced by irradiation of a mixture of nano3 nahco3 ph 8 3 containing the aniline substrate target compound tc to be degraded as well as phenol phoh in particular tc aniline ani 3 chloroaniline 3ca 4 chloroaniline 4ca and 3 4 dichloroaniline 3 4dca under uvb light nitrate photolyzes and gives ho which then oxidizes hco3 co3 2 to form co3 and h2o ho second order rate constants

photogenerated no2 might interfere by reacting with some radical intermediates but the use of h2o2 as alternative ho source was ruled out because h2o2 also reacts with ho producing the reductant o2 which in turn has high potential to interfere with back reduction processes canonica and schönenberger 2019 in the system containing nitrate and bicarbonate under irradiation both ho and co3 could potentially react with tc and phoh causing their degradation because our aim was to assess the importance of back reduction in the degradation of tc by co3 the reactions involving ho tc ho phoh and co3 phoh had to be minimized see scheme 1 to achieve the above goals photogenerated ho should be almost exclusively involved in the oxidation of hco3 co3 2 to produce co3 in other words the fraction of ho that reacts with hco3 co3 2 χ ho nahco 3 should be 95 eq 4 note that χ ho nahco 3 takes into account the ho reaction with both bicarbonate and carbonate at the same time the majority of co3 produced by ho should react with tc χ co 3 tc 95 eq 5 see also text s2 in the sm 4 χ ho nahco 3 k ho nahco 3 c nahco 3 k ho tc tc k ho phoh phoh k ho nahco 3 c nahco 3 0 95 5 χ co 3 tc k co 3 tc tc k

nahco 3 k ho hco 3 α hco 3 k ho co 3 2 α co 3 2 where α hco 3 and α co 3 2 are the molar fractions of hco3 and co3 2 at ph 8 3 computed taking into account the pka values of carbonic acid pka1 6 3 and pka2 10 3 e g millero et al 2002 finally tc phoh and c nahco 3 are the respective molar concentrations of tc fixed at 5 µm vione et al 2018 wenk and canonica 2012 phoh and nahco3 vide infra added to the solution being the values of k i j known see table s1 in the sm neta et al 1988 eqs 4 and 5 can be solved for the variables phoh and c nahco 3 as a result one gets the minimum value of c nahco 3 0 22 0 38 m depending on substrate and conditions and the maximum value of phoh 5 8 µm that should be used to allow for i the reactions of ho with hco3 co3 2 to prevail over the reactions of ho with tc and phoh and ii the reaction co3 tc to prevail over co3 phoh scheme 1 the complete chemical composition of the irradiated solutions is listed in table s1 sm to carry out the above experiments synthetic aqueous solutions 5 ml were magnetically stirred and irradiated in cylindrical pyrex glass cells under a philips narrow band tl 20 w 01 lamp the lamp mainly emits in the uvb wavelength range with emission maximum at 313 nm the spectral photon flux density p 0 λ fig s1 sm was assessed by means of chemical actinometry with 2 nitrobenzaldehyde carena et al 2019 galbavy et al 2010 willett and hites 2000 the direct photolysis can be an additional degradation pathway for tc and although this process does not affect the branching ratios of the reactions involving ho and co3 it is still an experimental bias chloro substituted anilines are known to undergo direct photolysis in the uvb range fig s2 sm carena et al 2018 to minimize their direct photolysis rate we used a higher nano3 concentration 25 mm exploiting the inner filter effect of nano3 and a lower lamp irradiance 2 9 0 3 w m 2 in contrast aniline did not show direct photolysis which allowed for the use of lower nitrate 10 mm and slightly higher lamp irradiance 4 2 0 2 w m 2 2 1 1 modeling tc degradation rate the degradation rate r tc of the organic substrate tc ani 3ca 4ca or 3 4dca upon uvb irradiation of a solution containing nano3 nahco3 tc phoh is r tc r co 3 tc r ho tc r d p where r co 3 tc r ho tc and r d p are the rates of tc degradation by co3 ho and the direct photolysis respectively based on the reactions reported in scheme 1 r co 3 tc and r ho tc can be expressed as follows 6 r co 3 tc k co 3 tc c o 3 tc k tc ao red t c phoh 7 r ho tc k ho tc h o tc under the irradiation conditions used in this work the steady state approximation can be applied to ho co3 and tc their steady state concentrations read as follows 8 h o r f ho k ho tc tc k ho phoh phoh k ho nahco 3 c nahco 3 9 c o 3 k ho nahco 3 c nahco 3 h o k co 3 tc tc k co 3 phoh phoh 10 t c k co 3 tc c o 3 tc k tc ao red phoh k tc ox by introducing these steady state concentration values in eqs 6 and 7 and by considering the definitions of χ ho nahco 3 χ co 3 tc eqs 4 and 5 and χ ho tc see text s2 sm one gets 11 r co 3 tc r f ho χ ho nahco 3 χ co 3 tc k tc ox k tc ao red phoh k tc ox 12 r ho tc r f ho χ ho tc where r f ho is the photoproduction rate of ho upon nitrate photolysis note that ho is mostly involved in the generation of co3 it is r f ho χ ho nahco 3 χ co 3 tc r co 3 tc 0 which is the value of r co 3 tc in the absence of phenol phoh 0 when phoh phoh 1 2 one has r co 3 tc 0 5 r co 3 tc 0 and k tc ox k tc ao red phoh 1 2 k tc ox 1 0 5 as a consequence it is phoh 1 2 k tc ox k tc ao red 1 and eq 11 is rearranged as follows 13 r co 3 tc r f ho χ ho nahco 3 χ co 3 tc 1 1 phoh phoh 1 2 finally by substituting eqs 12 and 13 into the expression for r tc one gets eq 14 14 r tc r f ho χ ho nahco 3 χ co 3 tc 1 1 phoh phoh 1 2 χ ho tc r d p where χ ho nahco 3 0 965 0 985 and χ ho tc 0 016 0 018 are the fractions of ho that react with respectively bicarbonate carbonate and the anilines tc under our experimental conditions c nahco 3 0 32 0 38 m ph 8 3 tc 0 5 µm while χ co 3 tc 0 97 0 99 is the fraction of co3 reacting with tc note that the formation rate of co3 is r f co 3 r f ho χ ho nahco 3 r f

persulfate photolysis the carbonate radical was also generated by photolysis of the persulfate anion in the presence of an excess of bicarbonate anion according to eqs 15 and 16 huie and clifton 1990

with so4 k so 4 co 3 2 4 1 106 m 1 s 1 padmaja et al 1993 but its contribution to co3 formation is only small i e 1 5 at ph 8 0 which was used in this study furthermore no drawback of this reaction is expected since no further reactive species than co3 are produced the reactions of so4 with organic compounds used in this study are expected to be fast second order rate constants up to 5 109 m 1 s 1 neta et al 1988 to reduce the transformation of these compounds due to direct reaction with so4 the concentrations of target compounds and the competitor were chosen to be a factor of 105 smaller compared to hco3 so4 can also react with the substrate used for its production i e s2o8 2 but this reaction channel is estimated to be 440 times smaller herrmann et al 1995 compared to co3 production owing to the low concentration of s2o8 2 1 mm possible products of this reaction are not expected to be relevant for the transformation of the used organic compounds at the experimental ph water is a further reactant to be considered for so4 and leads to the formation of hydroxyl radical ho eq 17 herrmann et al 1995 17 so 4 h 2 o so 4 2 h o h k so 4 h 2 o 1 19 10 1 m 1 s 1 the contribution of ho production from the reaction of so4 with ho at ph 8 ho 1 µm is about an order of magnitude smaller compared to water h2o 55 m canonica and schönenberger 2019 at the bicarbonate concentration used in this study 0 10 m ho formation rates are estimated to be 390 times lower compared to so4 formation rates the formed ho reacts at ph 8 with both hco3 and co3 2 leading to the formation of co3 eqs 2 and 3 the reactions of ho with the used organic compounds are expected to be fast second order rate constants up to 1 1010 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 but their importance for the transformation of these compounds is much lower compared to the aforementioned side reactions of so4 owing to the much lower formation rate of ho compared to so4 therefore the role of ho would be negligible in the frame of the used conditions 2 2 1 competition kinetics experiments aqueous solutions containing potassium persulfate 1 0 10 3 m sodium bicarbonate 1 0 10 1 m sulfuric acid 0 8 10 3 m a single target compound tc aniline or sulfadiazine 1 0 10 6 m the phenylurea metoxuron met as a competitor 1 0 10 6 m and a variable concentration of either phenol or 4 methylphenol were prepared in quartz glass tubes 18 mm external diameter 15 mm internal diameter using appropriate stock solutions of the various components with ph of 8 0 0 1 this ph was achieved by 1 5 dilution of a sodium bicarbonate stock solution 5 0 10 1 m that was supplemented with two drops of a concentrated sulfuric acid solution 4 6 m the tubes were closed with glass stoppers shaken by hand placed in a water bath and kept 15 min at a temperature of 25 0 c they were then submitted to irradiation in a temperature controlled 25 0 0 2 c dema hans mangels gmbh bornhein roisdorf germany model 125 merry go round photoreactor which was equipped with a heraeus noblelight model tq718 medium pressure mercury lamp operated at an input power of 500 w the lamp was placed in a cooling jacket consisting of a quartz glass inner wall a borosilicate glass outer wall and a uvw 55 glass filter supplied by dema in between the combination of these glasses resulted in a band pass filter for the wavelength range of 308 410 nm this setup was chosen in analogy to previous studies canonica and schönenberger 2019 to limit the direct phototransformation of the target compounds and the competitor while allowing for photolysis of persulfate mainly induced by the 313 nm emission line of the mercury lamp a more detailed description of the photoreactor and its operation is given elsewhere wegelin et al 1994 samples 400 µl were taken just before irradiation and during irradiation at regular time intervals filled into vials and immediately transferred to the refrigerated autosampler 5 0 c of the chromatographic equipment all kinetic experiments were performed at least in duplicate control irradiation experiments were performed with persulfate free solutions to check for possible interferences by direct or indirect phototransformation reactions of the target compounds and metoxuron met within the time range employed for competition kinetics experiments such transformation rates were typically two orders of magnitude lower than the rates induced by co3 in the absence of phenolic inhibitors but became more important for the higher concentrations of inhibitor these side reactions were considered when fitting the data as explained in the results and discussion section apparent second order rate constants for the reaction of co3 with a target compound tc leading to the transformation of tc k co 3 tc tr app were determined based on the following competition kinetics expression see text s3 sm for its derivation 18 ln tc 0 tc k co 3 tc tr app k co 3 met tr ln met 0 met where k co 3 met tr is the second order rate constant for the reaction of co3 with the competitor met leading to the transformation of met the term apparent app as a superscript in the rate constant was used to allow for possible side reactions in the transformation of tc from the slope α of the regression line of ln t c 0 t c vs ln m e t 0 m e t and the value of k co 3 met tr 8 1 107 m 1s 1 value determined by laser flash photolysis canonica et al 2005 the target compound rate constant was obtained as k co 3 tc tr app α k co 3 met tr in consideration of the absence of inhibitory effect due to antioxidant species during the excited triplet induced oxidation of phenylureas canonica and laubscher 2008 we made the assumption that k co 3 met tr remains unaffected by the presence of model antioxidants such as the employed phenols in the studied solutions 2 2 2 inhibitory effect of antioxidants on the second order rate constant of the carbonate radical induced oxidation of target compounds determined by competition kinetics the previously elaborated one channel model for the oxidation of tc inhibited by an antioxidant ao canonica and laubscher 2008 wenk et al 2011 is applied in this section to the derivation of the dependence of k co 3 tc tr app see text s3 sm for the definition of this second order rate constant on ao concentration ao phenol or 4 methylphenol in an analogous manner as performed in the case of the sulfate radical as an oxidant canonica and schönenberger 2019 we consider the case in which the transformation of tc is exclusively initiated by direct reaction with co3 i e side reactions of tc can be neglected the inhibitory effect of an ao on the oxidation of tc tc aniline or sulfadiazine is rationalized in terms of the following reaction equations 19 c o 3 tc co 3 2 t c k co 3 tc et 20 t c t c ox k tc ox 21 t c ao tc a o ox k tc ao red where tc is the reactive radical intermediate resulting from one electron oxidation of tc k co 3 tc et is the second order rate constant for the electron transfer et reaction between tc and co3 k tc ox is the first order rate constant for the transformation of tc to a stable oxidation product tcox and k tc ao red is the second order rate constant for reaction of tc with ao which leads to tc reduction back to tc and yields an oxidized antioxidant aoox the rate equations for tc and tc can be expressed as follows 22 d tc dt k

leads to the identity 26 k co 3 tc tr app k co 3 tc et 1 k tc ao red k tc ox ao since ao is generally also transformed during the kinetic runs k co 3 tc tr app from eq 26 is properly speaking not a kinetic constant however it can be approximated to a constant if ao does not deviate strongly from ao 0 during irradiation note that in the case of ao 0 k co 3 tc tr k co 3 tc et 2 3 back reduction processes in triplet sensitized phototransformation additional experiments were carried out to investigate back reduction by phenol phoh during the degradation of tc 3 4 dichloroaniline 3 4dca and 3 chloroaniline 3ca with excited triplet states back reduction is known to be operational in the degradation of aniline and 4 chloroaniline by 3cdom canonica and laubscher 2008 wenk and canonica 2012 the anionic form of 4 carboxybenzophenone benzophenone 4 carboxylate hereafter cbbp was here used as cdom proxy indeed cbbp has already been employed to this purpose and to determine representative second order rate constants for the reactions between organic substrates and 3cdom carena et al 2019 vione et al 2018 solutions containing cbbp were irradiated under a uva black lamp philips tl d 18 w with emission maximum at 369 nm which produced a uv irradiance of 42 6 0 7 w m 2 on top of the irradiated systems fig s1 sm a detailed description of this irradiation setup is reported in carena et al 2019 the initial concentrations of tc and cbbp were 5 and 70 µm respectively while phoh was varied between 0 and 10 µm the ph of the solutions was 7 and did not vary significantly during irradiation buffers were not used in these experiments to avoid unwanted side reactions the direct photolysis of 3 4dca and 3ca was negligible under uva irradiation during the experimental time interval 4 h irradiation 2 4 analytical methods the concentration of target compounds during kinetic runs was followed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc using an agilent 1100 system equipped with a quaternary low pressure mixing gradient pump a refrigerated autosampler a temperature controlled column compartment a diode array detector and an agilent 1200 fluorescence detector alternatively an analogous thermo fisher ultimate 3000 hplc system or a vwr hitachi lachrom elite chromatograph text s4 sm were used a detailed list of hplc analysis methods is given in table s2 sm 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of back reduction in co3 induced nitrate photolysis system and triplet sensitized transformation the degradation of anilines by co3 produced upon oxidation of hco3 co3 2 by ho generated by nitrate photolysis was inhibited when increasing the concentration of added phenol phoh fig s2 sm the experimental conditions were chosen to minimize the scavenging of either co3 or ho by phenol a process that would inhibit aniline degradation in a similar way as back reduction by excluding important scavenging of co3 ho it is possible to arguably assume that the observed inhibition by phenol was due to the reactions back reduction between phenol itself and the one electron oxidized intermediates formed upon transformation of the anilines scheme 1 assuming r tc r co 3 tc r ho tc r d p as per section 2 1 1 and taking into account the possible back reduction process r tc can be expressed as eq 14 that was written in close analogy to the kinetic equations used in previous works to describe back reduction in the triplet sensitized phototransformation of organic compounds vione et al 2018 wenk et al 2011 wenk and canonica 2012 the rate of tc direct photolysis r d p was assessed by correcting the direct photolysis rate measured in ultrapure water r d p exp see fig s2 sm for the experimental data for the inner filter effect of nitrate the direct photolysis of tc is slower in the presence of nitrate eq 27 carena et al 2018 27 r d p λ p λ ε tc λ tc ε no 3 λ n o 3 ε tc λ tc 1 10 b ε no 3 λ n o 3 ε tc λ tc d λ λ p λ 1 10 ε tc λ b tc d λ r d p exp in eq 27 p λ is the uvb lamp photon flux density incident over the solution ε λ is a molar absorption coefficient of tc or no3 and b is the solution optical path length 0 4 cm the correction factor was 0 94 r d p 0 94 r d p exp note that r d p was here considered not to vary with phoh because the direct photolysis of chloroanilines should occur via loss of chlorine atoms rather than through photoionization of the amino group carena et al 2018 consequently back reduction by phoh should not affect the direct photolysis process fig 1 shows the experimental profiles of r tc vs phoh for the studied anilines a very good fit to the experimental data was obtained with eq 14 which suggests that the kinetic model proposed for back reduction matches the experimental findings the calculated r d p values eq 27 were 0 49 0 03 nm s 1 for 3ca 3 4 0 5 nm s 1 for 4ca and 0 44 0 02 nm s 1 for 3 4dca direct photolysis was negligible in the case of ani the values of r f ho eq 14 obtained from data fit were 2 1 0 1 nm s 1 for ani 6 3 0 4 nm s 1 for 3ca 4 3 0 5 nm s 1 for 4ca and 3 9 0 3 nm s 1 for 3 4dca data fit also yielded phoh ½ 2 19 0 23 µm for ani 1 15 0 25 µm for 3ca 1 18 0 26 µm for 4ca and 1 18 0 22 µm for 3 4dca interestingly fig 2 shows that the values of phoh ½ obtained for the degradation of the anilines by co3 do not significantly differ from those observed in triplet sensitized oxidation induced by the triplet states of benzophenone 4 carboxylate 3cbbp and 2 acetonaphthone 32an this finding suggests that co3 3cbbp and 32an produce the same intermediates upon aniline oxidation which all undergo a similar back reduction process in the presence of phoh 3 2 back reduction processes upon generation of co3 by so4 as reactive intermediate initially competition kinetics experiments were performed for individual target compounds tc i e aniline and sulfadiazine in the absence of phenolic inhibitors analogous experiments were also executed for phenol and 4 methylphenol as antioxidant compounds these experiments yielded second order rate constants for the reaction of tc with co3 in the absence of additives which are termed as k co 3 tc tr and provided in table 1 the determined k co 3 tc tr values are within a factor of two compared to those known from the literature interestingly the determined co3 rate constants for phenol and 4 methylphenol are at least 11 and 3 times lower respectively compared to the rate constants for aniline and sulfadiazine this represents an obvious experimental advantage since these phenols are more resistant to direct co3 induced transformation and consequently expected to persist and exert their inhibitory effect during the whole course of tc transformation examples of kinetic runs showing the transformation of aniline as tc and metoxuron met as competitor in the presence and absence of 0 5 µm phenol as inhibitor are provided in fig 3 a which also shows the transformation kinetics of phenol all compounds exhibit zero order kinetics i e a linear decrease in their residual concentration with irradiation time for the system with aniline and metoxuron without added phenol this is an indication that aniline which reacts much faster than metoxuron is the major species responsible for the scavenging of co3 during the whole kinetic run and that no reaction products significantly reacting with co3 are formed indeed if r co 3 is the formation rate of co3 if r tc k co 3 tc tr tc co 3 and if co3 mainly reacts with tc it is co 3 r co 3 k co 3 tc tr tc 1 and r tc r co 3 which means that r tc is independent of tc zero order kinetics in the absence of phenol the depletion of both aniline and met is faster than in its presence but the reduction in depletion rate is more important for aniline fig 3b displays competition kinetics examples for the same compounds and different concentrations of added phenol the slope of the regression lines defined above as α and given numerically in the graph as a function of the concentration of added phenol decreases with increasing phenol concentration indicating a concomitantly decreasing k co 3 aniline tr app the trend in α shown in fig 3b clearly demonstrates the inhibitory effect of phenol on the transformation of aniline induced by co3 based on eq 26 we define here the inhibition factor if in analogy to previous studies as the ratio between k co 3 tc tr app and k co 3 tc tr where the latter is the second order rate constant for the transformation of tc induced by co3 determined without antioxidant addition 28 if ao k co 3 tc tr app k co 3 tc tr substituting the right hand term of eq 26 into eq 28 yields 29 if ao 1 1 k tc ao red k tc ox ao with ao 1 2 k tc ox k tc ao red eq 29 transforms to 30 i f a o 1 1 a o a o 1 2 series of competition kinetics experiments were performed for the two target compounds namely aniline and sulfadiazine using phenol and alternatively 4 methylphenol as antioxidants the results of these experiments are shown in fig 4 in terms of inhibition factor as a function of ao concentration for all four target compound antioxidant pairs a decrease in if with increasing ao is observed the four if data series were fitted to the following eq 31 which is a slightly modified form of eq 30 and is used to account for possible side reactions of the target compounds in analogy to previous studies wenk et al 2011 wenk and canonica 2012 31 i f a o f 1 a o a o 1 2 1 f here f is the fraction of tc reacting through the main pathway that is inhibited by antioxidants for aniline fits yielded identical ao 1 2 values for phenol 0 28 0 02 µm and 4 methylphenol 0 28 0 04 µm for sulfadiazine fitted ao 1 2 values were 0 79 0 10 µm for phenol and 0 67 0 06 µm for 4 methylphenol and therefore higher compared to aniline by a factor of 2 4 and 2 8 respectively obtained f values were high namely 0 78 for the pair sulfadiazine phenol and 0 92 for all other tc ao pairs indicating the minor importance of side reactions not subject to inhibition by ao in the case of aniline it is interesting to observe that the value of phoh ½ ao phenol is lower by an order of magnitude compared to the value obtained when co3 was produced by nitrate photolysis see section 3 1 it is also an order of magnitude lower compared to the values determined for triplet sensitized aniline transformation conducted using cbbp and 2 an as photosensitizers canonica and laubscher 2008 wenk and canonica 2012 all these phoh ½ values were obtained from experiments carried out at very similar ph values 8 0 8 3 therefore the slight changes in speciation of the various species involved in the back reduction process are probably not the cause of the differences in phoh ½ anilines ar nh2 undergo mono electronic oxidation by co3 elango et al 1984 huang and mabury 2000a jonsson et al 1994 liu et al 2018 wojnárovits et al 2020 and by the triplet states of 2 acetonapthone 32an and benzophenone 4 carboxylate 3cbbp canonica and laubscher 2008 vione et al 2018 wenk and canonica 2012 forming radical cations ar nh2 that easily deprotonate to produce ar nh previous works have shown that phenolic compounds including phenol phoh can act as antioxidants for the species ar nh canonica and laubscher 2008 vione et al 2018 wenk and canonica 2012 therefore the following reactions should take place in the studied systems where t represents an excited triplet state such as that of 32an 32 ar nh2 co3 ar nh2 co3 2 33 ar nh2 t ar nh2 t 34 ar nh2 ar nh h 35 ar nh oxidized products 36 ar nh phoh ar nh2 pho a possibility to account for differences in the phoh ½ values observed in different systems is to assume that antioxidant compounds are produced even in the absence of added phoh thereby providing a baseline level of back reduction canonica and schönenberger 2019 such a process would decrease the steady state ar nh with the consequence that the higher the baseline reductants the higher is the concentration of phoh quantified as phoh ½ required to obtain the same if value therefore different systems could show varying levels of baseline back reduction and provide different values of phoh ½ a potential photogenerated reductant is superoxide o2 which is for instance produced by reaction between t and dissolved oxygen canonica and schönenberger 2019 huber et al 2003 moreover the one electron oxidation of anilines is well known to produce phenolic intermediates bossmann et al 1998 that might act as baseline antioxidants as far as back reduction in sulfadiazine transformation is concerned the phoh ½ value found in this study 0 79 0 10 µm is well matched with phoh ½ 0 86 0 10 µm that was obtained for the transformation of sulfadiazine photosensitized by cbbp at ph 8 5 vione et al 2018 but four times lower than a previously determined value 3 2 0 8 µm for triplet sensitized transformation at ph 8 0 wenk and canonica 2012 therefore for sulfadiazine the presence of possible baseline antioxidants appears to play a less important role than in the case of aniline 3 3 environmental significance to assess the role of back reduction on the phototransformation of water pollutants the photochemical fate of aniline was modeled in a lake water scenario by means of the apex software fig 5 vione 2020 aniline was chosen here because two alternative values of phoh ½ were obtained in this work for this compound which could be observed under different conditions as far as transformation by co3 is concerned aniline does not undergo direct photolysis to a significant extent but it reacts with ho second order rate constant k ho ani tr 1 4

methylene blue as model photosensitizer in the case of natural waters the natural organic matter is the provider of phenolic antioxidant moieties the experimental phoh ½ values can be translated into doc½ equivalents as doc½ mgc l 1 0 4 phoh ½ µm as reported by vione et al 2018 see also leresche et al 2016 in the case of aniline ho no back reduction is expected wenk et al 2011 in the case of aniline 3cdom one has phoh ½ 2 8 µm doc½ 1 1 mgc l 1 wenk and canonica 2012 in the case of aniline co3 this work one has either phoh ½ 0 28 µm doc½ 0 11 mgc l 1 or phoh ½ 2 2 µm doc½ 0 88 mgc l 1 here three different scenarios are considered in the first scenario 1 no back reduction is supposed to be operational with either 3cdom or co3 in scenario 2 we used doc½ 1 1 mgc l 1 for the 3cdom process and doc½ 0 88 mgc l 1 for co3 moderate back reduction for co3 in scenario 3 we used again doc½ 1 1 mgc l 1 for 3cdom but doc½ 0 11 mgc l 1 for co3 strong back reduction for co3 fig 5 shows that in the absence of back reduction 5a co3 would be the main aniline photodegradation process at low doc while 3cdom would prevail at high doc indeed co3 is very efficiently scavenged by dom yan et al 2019 reaction with ho always plays a secondary role the back reduction processes increase the relative role of ho and the ho reaction becomes a very important if not the main pathway of aniline phototransformation in the most extreme back reduction scenario scenario 3 fig 5c the reaction with ho would prevail at low doc and would play a comparable role as 3cdom at high doc the back reduction processes also slow down significantly the photodegradation kinetics of aniline with an important increase in the relevant lifetimes 4 conclusion back reduction by phenolic compounds is operational in the case of the co3 mediated photodegradation of anilines and sulfadiazine the observed similarities concerning back reduction for co3 induced and triplet sensitized degradation suggest that the same reaction intermediates are involved in both cases the operational conditions by which co3 is photogenerated photolysis of nitrate or persulfate affect the experimental values of ao ½ for aniline presumably as a consequence of the different formation of additional reducing species in different systems in sunlit surface waters scenarios back reduction decreases the contributions of both co3 and 3cdom to aniline photodegradation in the absence of back reduction ho would always be a secondary process and aniline photodegradation would be dominated by co3 at low doc and by 3cdom at high doc in contrast ho and 3cdom play comparable roles at high doc with back reduction moreover in the strongest back reduction scenario for the co3 process aniline photodegradation at low doc would be dominated

16394,the carbonate radical co3 and the excited triplet states of chromophoric dissolved organic matter play an important role in the photodegradation of some easily oxidized pollutants in surface waters such as the aromatic amines anilines and sulfadiazine are known to undergo back reduction processes when their degradation is mediated by the excited triplet states of photosensitizers triplet sensitization back reduction which inhibits photodegradation means that phenols or the antioxidant mostly phenolic moieties occurring in the natural dissolved organic matter of surface waters reduce back to the parent compounds the radical species derived from the mono electronic oxidation of anilines and sulfadiazine here we show that a similar process takes place as well in the case of substrate oxidation by co3 the carbonate radical was here produced upon oxidation of hco3 co3 2 by either ho generated by nitrate photolysis or so4 obtained by photolysis of persulfate back reduction was observed in both cases in the presence of phenols but at different extents as far as the details of reaction kinetics are concerned and the occurrence of additional reductants might affect the efficacy by which phenols carry out the reduction process in particular when the carbonate radicals were produced by no3 photolysis in the presence of hco3 co3 2 the numerical values of phoh 1 2 the phenol concentration that halves the photodegradation rate of the substrate were 2 19 0 23 µm for aniline 1 15 0 25 µm for 3 chloroaniline 1 18 0 26 µm for 4 chloroaniline and 1 18 0 22 µm for 3 4 dichloroaniline in contrast when co3 was produced by photolysis of persulfate in the presence of hco3 co3 2 the corresponding values were 0 28 0 02 µm for aniline and 0 79 0 10 µm for sulfadiazine back reduction has the potential to significantly inhibit photodegradation by co3 and excited triplet states in natural waters and to comparatively increase the importance of ho mediated degradation that is not affected by the same phenomenon graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords back reduction aniline phenol excited triplet states photochemistry 1 introduction photochemical reactions are important processes for the degradation of organic contaminants especially biorecalcitrant compounds in sunlit surface waters photoinduced processes consist of the direct photolysis in which the contaminant absorbs sunlight and gets consequently transformed and of indirect phototransformation in the latter absorption of sunlight by photosensitizers such as the chromophoric dissolved organic matter cdom nitrate and nitrite yields reactive transient species either directly or upon interaction with the water matrix e g with the inorganic carbon species hco3 and co3 2 these photochemically produced reactive intermediates ppris can react with the contaminants the main ppris are the hydroxyl radical ho the triplet states of cdom 3cdom the singlet oxygen 1o2 and the carbonate radical co3 boreen et al 2003 remucal 2014 vialaton and richard 2002 yan and song 2014 the dissolved organic matter dom and its chromophoric fraction cdom play major roles in the photochemistry of natural surface waters cdom is a direct or indirect source of all the ppris but it is also able to inhibit the direct photolysis processes by competing with the contaminants for sunlight irradiance furthermore the dom is a key scavenger of both ho and co3 vione et al 2014 yan et al 2019 therefore the natural organic matter that occurs in surface waters is able to both inhibit and enhance the phototransformation reactions in addition to ppris scavenging dom can inhibit phototransformation through its antioxidant moieties aos mostly phenolic indeed it has been shown that the reactions between 3cdom and some contaminants especially aromatic amines yield partially oxidized intermediates which can be back reduced to the parent contaminants by dom aos canonica and laubscher 2008 wenk and canonica 2012 this back reduction process does not only affect reactions induced by 3cdom but has recently been shown to occur for the reaction of the sulfate radical so4 with several anilines and sulfonamide antibiotics canonica and schönenberger 2019 as well as for the reaction of co3 with the cyanotoxin cylindrospermopsin hao et al 2020 since co3 is a typical one electron oxidant neta et al 1988 that reacts efficiently with a variety of aromatic amine compounds canonica et al 2005 huang and mabury 2000a 2000b it is expected that such compounds are on the one hand significantly oxidized by co3 in the aquatic environment and experience on the other hand back reduction by dom aos interestingly occurrence of back reduction has not been observed in the case of ho which undergoes addition to aromatic rings more easily than one electron oxidation or h atom abstraction wenk et al 2011 the present study has the goal of detecting and quantifying back reduction by two phenols used as dom aos surrogates in the reactions of co3 with several anilines and the sulfonamide antibiotic sulfadiazine the oxidation of hco3 co3 2 to co3 by strongly oxidizing radicals was carried out through two alternative methods huang and mabury 2000a neta et al 1988 the first method is the photolysis of nitrate to yield ho mack and bolton 1999 and the second is the photolysis of persulfate s2o8 2 to form so4 criquet and leitner 2009 in addition the effect of phenol on the transformation of two anilines photosensitized by a model aromatic ketone as a cdom surrogate was also assessed with the purpose of comparing the extent of back reduction among different oxidation reactions 2 materials and methods the list of used chemicals is reported in text s1 of the supplementary material hereinafter sm the main issue with the production of co3 is that this radical is generated by oxidation of hco3 co3 2 therefore the production of co3 requires a stronger oxidant than co3 itself which may however be able to compete with co3 for the degradation processes great care is thus to be taken to define the operational conditions so that the chosen oxidant species is almost exclusively involved in the oxidation of inorganic carbon while the generated co3 reacts preferentially with the target substrate s in this work two methods were used and compared for the generation of co3 i oxidation by ho produced by nitrate photolysis and ii oxidation by so4 produced by photolysis of persulfate s2o8 2 2 1 formation of the carbonate radical co3 by nitrate photolysis the co3 radicals were produced by irradiation of a mixture of nano3 nahco3 ph 8 3 containing the aniline substrate target compound tc to be degraded as well as phenol phoh in particular tc aniline ani 3 chloroaniline 3ca 4 chloroaniline 4ca and 3 4 dichloroaniline 3 4dca under uvb light nitrate photolyzes and gives ho which then oxidizes hco3 co3 2 to form co3 and h2o ho second order rate constants

photogenerated no2 might interfere by reacting with some radical intermediates but the use of h2o2 as alternative ho source was ruled out because h2o2 also reacts with ho producing the reductant o2 which in turn has high potential to interfere with back reduction processes canonica and schönenberger 2019 in the system containing nitrate and bicarbonate under irradiation both ho and co3 could potentially react with tc and phoh causing their degradation because our aim was to assess the importance of back reduction in the degradation of tc by co3 the reactions involving ho tc ho phoh and co3 phoh had to be minimized see scheme 1 to achieve the above goals photogenerated ho should be almost exclusively involved in the oxidation of hco3 co3 2 to produce co3 in other words the fraction of ho that reacts with hco3 co3 2 χ ho nahco 3 should be 95 eq 4 note that χ ho nahco 3 takes into account the ho reaction with both bicarbonate and carbonate at the same time the majority of co3

the solution being the values of k i j known see table s1 in the sm neta et al 1988 eqs 4 and 5 can be solved for the variables phoh and c nahco 3 as a result one gets the minimum value of c nahco 3 0 22 0 38 m depending on substrate and conditions and the maximum value of phoh 5 8 µm that should be used to allow for i the reactions of ho with hco3 co3 2 to prevail over the reactions of ho with tc and phoh and ii the reaction co3 tc to prevail over co3 phoh scheme 1 the complete chemical composition of the irradiated solutions is listed in table s1 sm to carry out the above experiments synthetic aqueous solutions 5 ml were magnetically stirred and irradiated in cylindrical pyrex glass cells under a philips narrow band tl 20 w 01 lamp the lamp mainly emits in the uvb wavelength range with emission maximum at 313 nm the spectral photon flux density p 0 λ fig s1 sm was assessed by means of chemical actinometry with 2 nitrobenzaldehyde carena et al 2019 galbavy et al 2010 willett and hites 2000 the direct photolysis can be an additional degradation pathway for tc and although this process does not affect the branching ratios of the reactions involving ho and co3 it is still an experimental bias chloro substituted anilines are known to undergo direct photolysis in the uvb range fig s2 sm carena et al 2018 to minimize their direct photolysis rate we used a higher nano3 concentration 25 mm exploiting the inner filter effect of nano3 and a lower lamp irradiance 2 9 0 3 w m 2 in contrast aniline did not show direct photolysis which allowed for the use of lower nitrate

is the photoproduction rate of ho upon nitrate photolysis note that ho is mostly involved in the generation of co3 it is r f ho χ ho nahco 3 χ co 3 tc r co 3 tc 0 which is the value of r co 3 tc in the absence of phenol phoh 0 when phoh phoh 1 2 one has r co 3 tc 0 5 r co 3 tc 0 and k tc ox k tc ao red phoh 1 2 k tc ox 1 0 5 as a consequence it is phoh 1 2 k tc ox k tc ao red 1 and eq 11 is rearranged as follows 13 r co 3 tc r f ho χ ho nahco 3 χ co 3 tc 1 1 phoh phoh 1 2 finally by substituting eqs 12 and 13 into the expression for r tc one gets eq 14 14 r tc r f ho χ ho nahco 3 χ co 3

persulfate photolysis the carbonate radical was also generated by photolysis of the persulfate anion in the presence of an excess of bicarbonate anion according to eqs 15 and 16 huie and clifton 1990

compared to hco3 so4 can also react with the substrate used for its production i e s2o8 2 but this reaction channel is estimated to be 440 times smaller herrmann et al 1995 compared to co3 production

3 the reactions of ho with the used organic compounds are expected to be fast second order rate constants up to 1 1010 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 but their importance for the transformation of these compounds is much lower compared to the aforementioned side reactions of so4 owing to the much lower formation rate of ho compared to so4 therefore the role of ho would be negligible in the frame of the used conditions 2 2 1 competition kinetics experiments aqueous solutions containing potassium persulfate 1 0 10 3 m sodium bicarbonate 1 0 10 1 m sulfuric acid 0 8 10 3 m a single target compound tc aniline or sulfadiazine 1 0 10 6 m the phenylurea metoxuron met as a competitor 1 0 10 6 m and a variable concentration of either phenol or 4 methylphenol were prepared in quartz glass tubes 18 mm external diameter 15 mm internal diameter using appropriate stock solutions of the various components with ph of 8 0 0 1 this ph was achieved by 1 5 dilution of a sodium bicarbonate stock solution 5 0 10 1 m that was supplemented with two drops of a concentrated sulfuric acid solution 4 6 m the tubes were closed with glass stoppers shaken by hand placed in a water bath and kept 15 min at a temperature of 25 0 c they were then submitted to irradiation in a temperature controlled 25 0 0 2 c dema hans mangels gmbh bornhein roisdorf germany model 125 merry go round photoreactor which was equipped with a heraeus noblelight model tq718 medium pressure mercury lamp operated at an input power of 500 w the lamp was placed in a cooling jacket consisting of a quartz glass inner wall a borosilicate glass outer wall and a uvw 55 glass filter supplied by dema in between the combination of these glasses resulted in a band pass filter for the wavelength range of 308 410 nm this setup was chosen in analogy to previous studies canonica and schönenberger 2019 to limit the direct phototransformation of the target compounds and the competitor while allowing for photolysis of persulfate mainly induced by the 313 nm emission line of the mercury lamp a more detailed description of the photoreactor and its operation is given elsewhere wegelin et al 1994 samples 400 µl were taken just before irradiation and during irradiation at regular time intervals filled into vials and immediately transferred to the refrigerated autosampler 5 0 c of the chromatographic equipment all kinetic experiments were performed at least in duplicate control irradiation experiments were performed with persulfate free solutions to check for possible interferences by direct or indirect phototransformation reactions of the target compounds and metoxuron met within the time range employed for competition kinetics experiments such transformation rates were typically two orders of magnitude lower than the rates induced by co3 in the absence of phenolic inhibitors but became more important for the higher concentrations of inhibitor these side reactions were considered when fitting the data as explained in the results and discussion section apparent second order rate constants for the reaction of co3 with a target compound tc leading to the transformation of tc k co 3 tc tr app were determined based on the following competition kinetics expression see text s3 sm for its derivation 18 ln tc 0 tc k co 3 tc tr app k co 3 met tr ln met 0 met where k co 3 met tr is the second order rate constant for the reaction of co3 with the competitor met leading to the transformation of met the term apparent app as a superscript in the rate constant was used to allow for possible side reactions in the transformation of tc from the slope α of the regression line of ln t c 0 t c vs ln m e t 0 m e t and the value of k co 3 met tr 8 1 107 m 1s 1 value determined by laser flash photolysis canonica et al 2005 the target compound rate constant was obtained as k co 3 tc tr app α k co 3 met tr in consideration of the absence of inhibitory effect due to antioxidant species during the excited triplet induced oxidation of phenylureas canonica and laubscher 2008 we made the assumption that k co 3 met tr remains unaffected by the presence of model antioxidants such as the employed phenols in the studied solutions 2 2 2 inhibitory effect of antioxidants on the second order rate constant of the carbonate radical induced oxidation of target compounds determined by competition kinetics the previously elaborated one channel model for the oxidation of tc inhibited by an antioxidant ao canonica and laubscher 2008 wenk et al 2011 is applied in this section to the derivation of the dependence of k co 3 tc tr app see text s3 sm for the definition of this second order rate constant on ao concentration ao phenol or 4 methylphenol in an analogous manner as performed in the case of the sulfate radical as an oxidant canonica and schönenberger 2019 we consider the case in which the transformation of tc is exclusively initiated by direct reaction with co3 i e side reactions of tc can be neglected the inhibitory effect of an ao on the oxidation of tc tc aniline or sulfadiazine is rationalized in terms of the following reaction equations 19 c o 3 tc co 3 2 t c k co 3 tc et 20 t c t c ox k tc ox 21 t c ao tc a o ox k tc ao red where tc is the reactive radical intermediate resulting from one electron oxidation of tc k co 3 tc et is the second order rate constant for the electron transfer et reaction between tc and co3 k tc ox is the first order rate constant for the transformation of tc to a stable oxidation product tcox and k tc ao red is the second order rate constant for reaction of tc with ao which leads to tc reduction back to tc and yields an oxidized antioxidant aoox the rate equations for tc and tc can be expressed as follows 22 d tc dt k co 3 tc et c o 3 tc k tc ao red t c ao 23 d t c dt k co 3 tc et c o 3 tc k tc ao red t c ao k tc ox t c applying the steady state assumption for tc leads to the following equation 24 t c k co 3 tc et c o 3 tc k tc ox k tc ao red ao substituting tc from eq 24 into eq 22 and rearranging yields eq 25 25 d tc dt k co 3 tc et 1 k tc ao red k tc ox ao c o 3 tc comparing eqs s5 see text s3 sm and 25 leads to the identity 26 k co 3 tc tr app k co 3 tc et 1 k tc ao red k tc ox ao since ao is generally also transformed during the kinetic runs k co 3 tc tr app from eq 26 is properly speaking not a kinetic constant however it can be approximated to a constant if ao does not deviate strongly from ao 0 during irradiation note that in the case of ao 0 k co 3 tc tr k co 3 tc et 2 3 back reduction processes in triplet sensitized phototransformation additional experiments were carried out to investigate back reduction by phenol phoh during the degradation of tc 3 4 dichloroaniline 3 4dca and 3 chloroaniline 3ca with excited triplet states back reduction is known to be operational in the degradation of aniline and 4 chloroaniline by 3cdom canonica and laubscher 2008 wenk and canonica 2012 the anionic form of 4 carboxybenzophenone benzophenone 4 carboxylate hereafter cbbp was here used as cdom proxy indeed cbbp has already been employed to this purpose and to determine representative second order rate constants for the reactions between organic substrates and 3cdom carena et al 2019 vione et al 2018 solutions containing cbbp were irradiated under a uva black lamp philips tl d 18 w with emission maximum at 369 nm which produced a uv irradiance of 42 6 0 7 w m 2 on top of the irradiated systems fig s1 sm a detailed description of this irradiation setup is reported in carena et al 2019 the initial concentrations of tc and cbbp were 5 and 70 µm respectively while phoh was varied between 0 and 10 µm the ph of the solutions was 7 and did not vary significantly during irradiation buffers were not used in these experiments to avoid unwanted side reactions the direct photolysis of 3 4dca and 3ca was negligible under uva irradiation during the experimental time interval 4 h irradiation 2 4 analytical methods the concentration of target compounds during kinetic runs was followed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc using an agilent 1100 system equipped with a quaternary low pressure mixing gradient pump a refrigerated autosampler a temperature controlled column compartment a diode array detector and an agilent 1200 fluorescence detector alternatively an analogous thermo fisher ultimate 3000 hplc system or a vwr hitachi lachrom elite chromatograph text s4 sm were used a detailed list of hplc analysis methods is given in table s2 sm 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of back reduction in co3 induced nitrate photolysis system and triplet sensitized transformation the degradation of anilines by co3 produced upon oxidation of hco3 co3 2 by ho generated by nitrate photolysis was inhibited when increasing the concentration of added phenol phoh fig s2 sm the experimental conditions were chosen to minimize the scavenging of either co3 or ho by phenol a process that would inhibit aniline degradation in a similar way as back reduction by excluding important scavenging of co3 ho it is possible to arguably assume that the observed inhibition by phenol was due to the reactions back reduction between phenol itself and the one electron oxidized intermediates formed upon transformation of the anilines scheme 1 assuming r tc r co 3 tc r ho tc r d p as per section 2 1 1 and taking into account the possible back reduction process r tc can be expressed as eq 14 that was written in close analogy to the kinetic equations used in previous works to describe back reduction in the triplet sensitized phototransformation of organic compounds vione et al 2018 wenk et al 2011 wenk and canonica 2012 the rate of tc direct photolysis r d p was assessed by correcting the direct photolysis rate measured in ultrapure water r d p exp see fig s2 sm for the experimental data for the inner filter effect of nitrate the direct photolysis of tc is slower in the presence of nitrate eq 27 carena et al 2018 27 r d p λ p λ ε tc λ tc ε no 3 λ n o 3 ε tc λ tc 1 10 b ε no 3 λ n o 3 ε tc λ tc d λ λ p λ 1 10 ε tc λ b tc d λ r d p exp in eq 27 p λ is the uvb lamp photon flux density incident over the solution ε λ is a molar absorption coefficient of tc or no3 and b is the solution optical path length 0 4 cm the correction factor was 0 94 r d p 0 94 r d p exp note that r d p was here considered not to vary with phoh because the direct photolysis of chloroanilines should occur via loss of chlorine atoms rather than through photoionization of the amino group carena et al 2018 consequently back reduction by phoh should not affect the direct photolysis process fig 1 shows the experimental profiles of r tc vs phoh for the studied anilines a very good fit to the experimental data was obtained with eq 14 which suggests that the kinetic model proposed for back reduction matches the experimental findings the calculated r d p values eq 27 were 0 49 0 03 nm s 1 for 3ca 3 4 0 5 nm s 1 for 4ca and 0 44 0 02 nm s 1 for 3 4dca direct photolysis was negligible in the case of ani the values of r f ho eq 14 obtained from data fit were 2 1 0 1 nm s 1 for ani 6 3 0 4 nm s 1 for 3ca 4 3 0 5 nm s 1 for 4ca and 3 9 0 3 nm s 1 for 3 4dca data fit also yielded phoh ½ 2 19 0 23 µm for ani 1 15 0 25 µm for 3ca 1 18 0 26 µm for 4ca and 1 18 0 22 µm for 3 4dca interestingly fig 2 shows that the values of phoh ½ obtained for the degradation of the anilines by co3 do not significantly differ from those observed in triplet sensitized oxidation induced by the triplet states of benzophenone 4 carboxylate 3cbbp and 2 acetonaphthone 32an this finding suggests that co3 3cbbp and 32an produce the same intermediates upon aniline oxidation which all undergo a similar back reduction process in the presence of phoh 3 2 back reduction processes upon generation of co3 by so4 as reactive intermediate initially competition kinetics experiments were performed for individual target compounds tc i e aniline and sulfadiazine in the absence of phenolic inhibitors analogous experiments were also executed for phenol and 4 methylphenol as antioxidant compounds these experiments yielded second order rate constants for the reaction of tc with co3 in the absence of additives which are termed as k co 3 tc tr and provided in table 1 the determined k co 3 tc tr values are within a factor of two compared to those known from the literature interestingly the determined co3 rate constants for phenol and 4 methylphenol are at least 11 and 3 times lower respectively compared to the rate constants for aniline and sulfadiazine this represents an obvious experimental advantage since these phenols are more resistant to direct co3 induced transformation and consequently expected to persist and exert their inhibitory effect during the whole course of tc transformation examples of kinetic runs showing the transformation of aniline as tc and metoxuron met as competitor in the presence and absence of 0 5 µm phenol as inhibitor are provided in fig 3 a which also shows the transformation kinetics of phenol all compounds exhibit zero order kinetics i e a linear decrease in their residual concentration with irradiation time for the system with aniline and metoxuron without added phenol this is an indication that aniline which reacts much faster than metoxuron is the major species responsible for the scavenging of co3 during the whole kinetic run and that no reaction products significantly reacting with co3 are formed indeed if r co 3 is the formation rate of co3 if r tc k co 3 tc tr tc co 3 and if co3 mainly reacts with tc it is co 3 r co 3 k co 3 tc tr tc 1 and r tc r co 3 which means that r tc is independent of tc zero order kinetics in the absence of phenol the depletion of both aniline and met is faster than in its presence but the reduction in depletion rate is more important for aniline fig 3b displays competition kinetics examples for the same compounds and different concentrations of added phenol the slope of the regression lines defined above as α and given numerically in the graph as a function of the concentration of added phenol decreases with increasing phenol concentration indicating a concomitantly decreasing k co 3 aniline tr app the trend in α shown in fig 3b clearly demonstrates the inhibitory effect of phenol on the transformation of aniline induced by co3 based on eq 26 we define here the inhibition factor if in analogy to previous studies as the ratio between k co 3 tc tr app and k co 3 tc tr where the latter is the second order rate constant for the transformation of tc induced by co3 determined without antioxidant addition 28 if ao k co 3 tc tr app k co 3 tc tr substituting the right hand term of eq 26 into eq 28 yields 29 if ao 1 1 k tc ao red k tc ox ao with ao 1 2 k tc ox k tc ao red eq 29 transforms to 30 i f a o 1 1 a o a o 1 2 series of competition kinetics experiments were performed for the two target compounds namely aniline and sulfadiazine using phenol and alternatively 4 methylphenol as antioxidants the results of these experiments are shown in fig 4 in terms of inhibition factor as a function of ao concentration for all four target compound antioxidant pairs a decrease in if with increasing ao is observed the four if data series were fitted to the following eq 31 which is a slightly modified form of eq 30 and is used to account for possible side reactions of the target compounds in analogy to previous studies wenk et al 2011 wenk and canonica 2012 31 i f a o f 1 a o a o 1 2 1 f here f is the fraction of tc reacting through the main pathway that is inhibited by antioxidants for aniline fits yielded identical ao 1 2 values for phenol 0 28 0 02 µm and 4 methylphenol 0 28 0 04 µm for sulfadiazine fitted ao 1 2 values were 0 79 0 10 µm for phenol and 0 67 0 06 µm for 4 methylphenol and therefore higher compared to aniline by a factor of 2 4 and 2 8 respectively obtained f values were high namely 0 78 for the pair sulfadiazine phenol and 0 92 for all other tc ao pairs indicating the minor importance of side reactions not subject to inhibition by ao in the case of aniline it is interesting to observe that the value of phoh ½ ao phenol is lower by an order of magnitude compared to the value obtained when co3 was produced by nitrate photolysis see section 3 1 it is also an order of magnitude lower compared to the values determined for triplet sensitized aniline transformation conducted using cbbp and 2 an as photosensitizers canonica and laubscher 2008 wenk and canonica 2012 all these phoh ½ values were obtained from experiments carried out at very similar ph values 8 0 8 3 therefore the slight changes in speciation of the various species involved in the back reduction process are probably not the cause of the differences in phoh ½ anilines ar nh2 undergo mono electronic oxidation by co3 elango et al 1984 huang and mabury 2000a jonsson et al 1994 liu et al 2018 wojnárovits et al 2020 and by the triplet states of 2 acetonapthone 32an and benzophenone 4 carboxylate 3cbbp canonica and laubscher 2008 vione et al 2018 wenk and canonica 2012 forming radical cations ar nh2 that easily deprotonate to produce ar nh previous works have shown that phenolic compounds including phenol phoh can act as antioxidants for the species ar nh canonica and laubscher 2008 vione et al 2018 wenk and canonica 2012 therefore the following reactions should take place in the studied systems where t represents an excited triplet state such as that of 32an 32 ar nh2 co3 ar nh2 co3 2 33 ar nh2 t ar nh2 t 34 ar nh2 ar nh h 35 ar nh oxidized products 36 ar nh phoh ar nh2 pho a possibility to account for differences in the phoh ½ values observed in different systems is to assume that antioxidant compounds are produced even in the absence of added phoh thereby providing a baseline level of back reduction canonica and schönenberger 2019 such a process would decrease the steady state ar nh with the consequence that the higher the baseline reductants the higher is the concentration of phoh quantified as phoh ½ required to obtain the same if value therefore different systems could show varying levels of baseline back reduction and provide different values of phoh ½ a potential photogenerated reductant is superoxide o2 which is for instance produced by reaction between t and dissolved oxygen canonica and schönenberger 2019 huber et al 2003 moreover the one electron oxidation of anilines is well known to produce phenolic intermediates bossmann et al 1998 that might act as baseline antioxidants as far as back reduction in sulfadiazine transformation is concerned the phoh ½ value found in this study 0 79 0 10 µm is well matched with phoh ½ 0 86 0 10 µm that was obtained for the transformation of sulfadiazine photosensitized by cbbp at ph 8 5 vione et al 2018 but four times lower than a previously determined value 3 2 0 8 µm for triplet sensitized transformation at ph 8 0 wenk and canonica 2012 therefore for sulfadiazine the presence of possible baseline antioxidants appears to play a less important role than in the case of aniline 3 3 environmental significance to assess the role of back reduction on the phototransformation of water pollutants the photochemical fate of aniline was modeled in a lake water scenario by means of the apex software fig 5 vione 2020 aniline was chosen here because two alternative values of phoh ½ were obtained in this work for this compound which could be observed under different conditions as far as transformation by co3 is concerned aniline does not undergo direct photolysis to a significant extent but it reacts with ho second order rate constant k ho ani tr 1 4 1010 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 co3 k co 3 ani tr 5 108 m 1 s 1 this work and 3cdom k 3 cdom ani tr 4 109 m 1 s 1 estimated from values published by erickson et al 2015 for several anilines using methylene blue as model photosensitizer in the case of natural waters the natural organic matter is the provider of phenolic antioxidant moieties the experimental phoh ½ values can be translated into doc½ equivalents as doc½ mgc l 1 0 4 phoh ½ µm as reported by vione et al 2018 see also leresche et al 2016 in the case of aniline ho no back reduction is expected wenk et al 2011 in the case of aniline 3cdom one has phoh ½ 2 8 µm doc½ 1 1 mgc l 1 wenk and canonica 2012 in the case of aniline co3 this work one has either phoh ½ 0 28 µm doc½ 0 11 mgc l 1 or phoh ½ 2 2 µm doc½ 0 88 mgc l 1 here three different scenarios are considered in the first scenario 1 no back reduction is supposed to be operational with either 3cdom or co3 in scenario 2 we used doc½ 1 1 mgc l 1 for the 3cdom process and doc½ 0 88 mgc l 1 for co3 moderate back reduction for co3 in scenario 3 we used again doc½ 1 1 mgc l 1 for 3cdom but doc½ 0 11 mgc l 1 for co3 strong back reduction for co3 fig 5 shows that in the absence of back reduction 5a co3 would be the main aniline photodegradation process at low doc while 3cdom would prevail at high doc indeed co3 is very efficiently scavenged by dom yan et al 2019 reaction with ho always plays a secondary role the back reduction processes increase the relative role of ho and the ho reaction becomes a very important if not the main pathway of aniline phototransformation in the most extreme back reduction scenario scenario 3 fig 5c the reaction with ho would prevail at low doc and would play a comparable role as 3cdom at high doc the back reduction processes also slow down significantly the photodegradation kinetics of aniline with an important increase in the relevant lifetimes 4 conclusion back reduction by phenolic compounds is operational in the case of the co3 mediated photodegradation of anilines and sulfadiazine the observed similarities concerning back reduction for co3 induced and triplet sensitized degradation suggest that the same reaction intermediates are involved in both cases the operational conditions by which co3 is photogenerated photolysis of nitrate or persulfate affect the experimental values of ao ½ for aniline presumably as a consequence of the different formation of additional reducing species in different systems in sunlit surface waters scenarios back reduction decreases the contributions of both co3 and 3cdom to aniline photodegradation in the absence of back reduction ho would always be a secondary process and aniline photodegradation would be dominated by co3 at low doc and by 3cdom at high doc in contrast ho and 3cdom play comparable roles at high doc with back reduction moreover in the strongest back reduction scenario for the co3 process aniline photodegradation at low doc would be dominated
