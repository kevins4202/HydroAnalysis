14925,decentralization is recognized as an emerging solution for a more sustainable urban wastewater system uws for the future however the debate of centralization vs decentralization at the system s planning stage remains unresolved mainly due to the complexity of the system s spatial structure and the multiple design objectives such as water reuse and energy conservation this paper presents the sustainable urban wastewater system generator suwstor as a tool to address this issue integrating a graph representation of the system structure and the ant colony algorithm suwstor can produce pareto optimal solutions for system design under three objectives minimizing the capital cost minimizing the operational energy consumption and maximizing the water reuse capacity the model is used for system design in a 100 square km new city the xiong an new district in china compared to the solution based on human experience the model can reduce the system s capital cost by 7 and the operational energy in the pipe network by 26 while maintaining the water reuse capacity at 100 with this model the relation between the optimal system layout and the choice over different design objectives can be discussed for any given area in our case study the optimal capacity of wwtps for the lowest cost solution is 48 000 m3 per day leading to a total number of wwtps of 5 as the water reuse level increases to maximum the optimal capacity reduces to 15 000 m3 per day where the number of wwtps is 16 the model is also able to perform significantly better than the locally optimized results in which only the wwtp locations are fixed at their optimal values this demonstrates the importance of a global optimization model in designing the integrated uws graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords urban wastewater system multi objective optimization decentralization ant colony optimization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the debate on centralization versus decentralization in urban wastewater systems uws began at the end of the 20th century anderson 1996 otterpohl et al 1997 van lier and lettinga 1999 the core question of this debate is how many wastewater treatment plants wwtp should be built in a given area and relatedly what the optimal size of a wwtp is libralato et al 2012 for a long time the focus has been solely on the wwtp itself to determine the optimal size driven by economies of scale and the requirement of a more stable influent it has been common practice to build a centralized wwtp resulting in a relatively larger treatment scale recently this approach is questioned for several reasons firstly unlike the economies of scale in wastewater treatment diseconomies of scale generally exist in the construction of sewer networks and their construction costs can take up more than 80 of the system s total investment costs in some cases eggimann et al 2015 secondly along with technological advances better and more stable performance in pollutant removal is no longer the exclusive advantage of large wwtps smaller wwtps can achieve similar results rahm et al 2018 moreover when sustainability related design objectives are considered such as water recycling energy saving flexibility and or resilience the advantages of a decentralized layout are pointed out by more and more studies weber et al 2007 daigger 2009 gikas and tchobanoglous 2009 libralato et al 2012 maurer 2013 tchobanoglous and leverenz 2013 roefs et al 2017 garrido baserba et al 2018 leigh and lee 2019 gude 2021 gul et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 therefore the degree of centralization or decentralization of wastewater systems is an issue that cannot be avoided as we think about the future sustainable urban water infrastructure especially as the concept of infrastructure resilience becomes increasingly accepted discernment of this debate is necessary for developing countries with inadequate infrastructure and equally crucial for developed countries facing infrastructure renewal in the past two decades case studies and scenario analyses have been carried out to assess the pros and cons of the decentralized uws libralato et al 2012 however these studies consider only the technological aspect of decentralization and have no regard for the change in uws s spatial layout e g garrido baserba et al 2018 after all it is difficult to discuss the spatial layout of uws in a limited number of scenarios for example opher and friedler 2016 assess the life cycle environmental impacts of four uws configurations for a city in israel the results show that the decentralized configuration prevails due to the fewer materials and energy consumed in the reclaimed water supply however the hypothetical system configurations considered in this study include only the two extremes one being the whole city equipped with decentralized greywater reuse systems at the building or household scale and the other being a centralized water reuse system with one large wwtp since a hybrid centralized decentralized configuration is often subject to many uncertain factors these scenario based studies commonly fail to answer whether a hybrid configuration performs better than the centralized or decentralized extreme virtual case generators moderl et al 2009 urich et al 2010 duque et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 and spatial optimization models are viable tools to increase the number of scenarios and discuss centralization versus decentralization a large group of spatial optimization models optimize the sewer network route and sizes with only one wwtp haghighi and bakhshipour 2012 2015 moeini and afshar 2012 2019 these models are not able to address the debate on centralization or decentralization cunha et al 2009 represent one of the early models to optimize the number and locations of wwtps and their respective sewer networks the model assumes that the sewage pipes follow straight lines between the region s population centres this relatively simple generalization of the network topology enables efficient calculation so that their model can be applied to an area of more than 1000 square km eggimann et al 2015 use a greedy algorithm to iteratively decide for each wastewater discharging unit whether to connect to an existing wwtp or to construct a new one thus the model can decide the optimal degree of centralization i e the number of wwtps jung et al 2018 combine the random sampling algorithm for the locations of wwtps and the dijkstra algorithm dijkstra 1959 for the sewer network in their case the system s life cycle cost generally increases with the number of wwtps spatial optimization models are also applied to the route of the reclaimed water system including determining the size of reclaimed water treatment facilities and the route of the reclaimed water pipe network lee et al 2016 dev et al 2021 liu et al 2021 the discussion of the degree of centralization and decentralization of uwss using spatial optimization models also evolves towards multidimensional decision objectives for example the model of cunha et al 2009 is extended to include receiving water quality zeferino et al 2010 or reliability zeferino et al 2014 as the additional objective for siting and sizing of wwtps at the watershed scale kavvada et al 2016 compares the impact of centralized and decentralized uwss on wastewater reuse in terms of life cycle cost and greenhouse emission kavvada et al 2018 integrates the construction cost operational energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission of uwss into an objective function to optimize the location and size of wwtps and the route of the sewer network in an urban area dong et al 2012 developed a pareto optimization model for the spatial layout optimization of wastewater and reclaimed water systems considering life cycle cost pollution load discharged to receiving water and the proportion of wastewater reuse bakhshipour et al 2021 zahediasl et al 2021 and hesarkazzazi et al 2022 represent the latest studies on system decentralization using optimization models and multi dimensional decision making they developed graph based heuristic algorithm to generate near optimal solutions for stormwater systems and green infrastructure bakhshipour et al 2021 show that in stormwater systems when only the conventional pipe system is considered decentralization is always preferable as it benefits both system s cost and resilience whereas trade off exists between these two objectives when we consider the scale of green infrastructure we can see from these studies that the optimal degree of centralization is case specific and depends on the choice of design and evaluation criteria based on the above mentioned works we find that the established spatial optimization models are often developed only for the wastewater system or the reclaimed water system separately however there is a strong coupling between these two systems and separated optimization does not describe their interactions sustainability requires a systematic perspective to optimize the performance of urban water infrastructures and the current separated optimization practices are not consistent with it in addition a multi objective pareto optimization enables a new perspective which allows us to identify the impact of centralization and decentralization on the trade off relationship among multiple performances of the uwss such work will provide us with new knowledge for designing future uwss in the framework of sustainable development therefore to provide the tool for discussing centralization versus decentralization of the uwss we establish a global multi objective optimization model the sustainable urban wastewater system generator suwstor the model can generate the pareto optimal solutions of uwss with consideration of capital cost operational energy consumption and water reuse capacity each solution contains the number locations and capacities of the wwtps including reclaimed water treatment and the route and the hydraulic parameters of both the sewer and reclaimed water pipe network in section 2 the input output objective functions constraints and optimization algorithm of suwstor will be introduced section 3 describes the case area where the model is tested and the model s performance section 4 provides case specific results on the system s optimal degree of centralization and discusses the model s advantages and limitations finally section 5 will provide some conclusions 2 method 2 1 input of suwstor the input of the suwstor can be described as an undirected graph g along with some attributes of its nodes and edges the edges represent the potential routes for the sewer pipelines and the reclaimed water pipelines which can but does not have to be obtained from the road network in an urban area the length of the edges l i should be provided by the model user the nodes serve as potential junction nodes of the sewer network or reclaimed water network their elevation e l e v i should be provided a subset of the nodes represents system users when there is wastewater discharge or reclaimed water demand the quantity of wastewater q i w a s t e or reclaimed water q i r e u s e at these nodes should be provided another subset of the nodes represents potential locations of the wwtps the maximum area available to construct a wwtp at these nodes should be provided if there is such a restriction the required input attribute of the nodes and edges are listed in table 1 2 2 output of suwstor the output of the suwstor is a sub graph of g denoted gs along with attributes of its nodes and edges the adjacency matrix of gs is denoted by s the edges of gs represent the route of the designed sewage pipelines and the reclaimed water pipelines for simplicity the model uses the same graph gs to represent the route of both the sewage pipelines and the reclaimed water pipelines a list of output can be seen in table 2 the decision variables of the optimization model consist of i the adjacent matrix of gs s ii whether or not a node is supplied with reclaimed water r i iii whether a node is chosen as a wwtp w i any other output information table 2 can be derived from the decision variables 2 3 objective functions the suwstor considers three objectives minimizing the system s capital cost co minimizing the operational energy consumption en and maximizing the water reuse capacity re capital cost co is the sum of four components the cost of wastewater collection c o w c wastewater treatment c o w t reclaimed water treatment c o r t and reclaimed water distribution c o r d eq 1 c o w t is the sum of the capital cost of pipes and pumps the former is a function of the designed layout of the pipelines s the length diameter and cover depths of each pipe l i d i w a s t e h i 1 h i 2 the latter is the function of the capacities and the height difference of each

i 1 n r i q i r e u s e i 1 n q i r e u s e 100 n the number of nodes in graph g 2 4 constraints the constraints considered in the suwstor are see si section 1 2 for the formulae of these constraints i water quantity balance the capacity of reclaimed water treatment should not be greater than the wastewater inflow times a reduction factor of the wwtp on the same node ii area restrictions the land area required for the construction of the wwtp is not greater than the maximally available area iii topological constraints each system user node should be connected to exactly one wwtp node via a unique route essentially this requires that gs is a sub forest a set of non intersecting sub trees of g iv hydraulic constraints the sewage pipes are gravity flow pipes reclaimed water is distributed through pressure pipes their sizes and slopes must satisfy the hydraulic constraints in the national design code 2 5 the optimization algorithm the suwstor applies the ant colony optimization aco algorithm dorigo and gambardella 1997 to solve the optimization problem the aco algorithm imitates the process of path finding of an ant colony where the ants cooperate to find good solutions e g the shortest path through their communication by pheromone the ant which finds a better solution e g a shorter path leaves more pheromone on its path the pheromone in turn affects the choices of later ants i e the higher the pheromone concentration on a path the more likely an ant will choose it the aco algorithm in suwstor includes the following modules fig 1 a pheromone initialization b solution formation c calculating the objective functions and removing infeasible solutions d non dominated sorting deb et al 2002 e pheromone updating and f stopping after a given number of iterations the algorithm then repeats from module b until it finally stops the algorithm utilizes four pheromone matrices or tensors τ reuse τ n τ wwtp and τ pipe τ n affects how many wwtps are built in the solution τ wwtp affects which locations are more likely to be chosen τ reuse determines the likelihood of each user to be supplied with reclaimed water finally τ pipe affects the ants choice when they are forming the layout of the wastewater and reclaimed water pipelines the structures of the pheromone matrices or tensors are based on the pareto ant colony algorithm developed by doerner et al 2004 for multi objective optimization the rules of pheromone initialization module a and update module e are based on the max min ant system developed by stützle and hoos 2000 more details of pheromone utilization are stated in si section 2 the solution formation module b is a general process through which the ants form a feasible solution under the guidance of the pheromone the process consists of the following steps 1 determine r i i e whether each node is supplied with reclaimed water based on τ reuse 2 determine w i i e which nodes are chosen as wwtp locations first the ant chooses an integer n between 1 and nmax the total number of potential locations of wwtps based on τ n then the ant iteratively takes a location from the remaining unchosen locations based on τ wwtp until the total number of wwtps reaches n 3 determine s i e the layout of the pipelines gosavi et al 2003 developed a process for ants to form a sub tree in a graph their process is modified here to suit the constraints in designing the uws s layout firstly one ant is placed on each of the system user nodes i e nodes with either wastewater discharge or reclaimed water demand or both secondly shuffle the order in which the ants will move then each ant iteratively moves to an adjacent node which is not on its previous path the choice of their next node is affected by τ pipe and a heuristic information η pipe calculated from the slope between each pair of adjacent nodes if there are no feasible next nodes after the ant moves re placed it to a random node on its previous path which has at least one feasible next node next check if the ants meet the stopping condition when an ant reaches a node on another ant s path the ant is terminated and its path is appended to the other ant s path when an ant reaches a node chosen for wwtps it is terminated finally when all non terminated ants have moved for once the order of the ants is re shuffled and the procedure is repeated until all ants are terminated the detailed formula on how the pheromone matrices or tensors affect the ants choices in these steps are described in si section 2 and specifically an example is provided in si section 2 5 some locations of wwtps chosen in step 2 might not be reached by any ants in step 3 these locations are removed from the solution finally a forest with nwwtp nwwtp n trees is formed as s where nwwtp is the final number of wwtps 3 case study 3 1 case area description we apply our model in xiong an new district china it is located in hebei province less than 200 km south to the nation s capital beijing and is one of the nation s most ambitious urbanization projects of the new millennium fig 2 according to plan around 1 million residents are going to dwell in an area of 100 km2s management committee of xiong an new district 2020 the region is planned to be dominated by residence and commerce each occupy approximately 20 and 80 of the built up areas except for green spaces the topography of the region is almost flat with a maximum elevation difference of 4 m the graph g of the case area consists of 498 nodes and 839 edges 26 potential locations for wwtps are identified by the decision maker fig 3 wastewater discharge is estimated as 50 m3 d ha for residential users and 60 m3 d ha for commercial users resulting in a total wastewater discharge of 2 4 105 m3 day according to decision makers the reclaimed water demand only includes toilet flushing for non residential users which is 10 m3 d ha and totally 3 7 104 m3 day according to the emission standards in china the wwtps should include secondary treatment and nutrient removal advanced treatment should be applied in addition for reclaimed water the coefficients of the empirical functions to estimate the capital cost and operational energy consumption of wwtps are obtained from studies on local data based on these requirements see si section 1 1 for details based on a statistical analysis across more than 4000 wwtps in china we assume that the unit energy energy consumption per cubic meter wastewater of wastewater treatment is uncorrelated to their capacity therefore the energy for wastewater treatment e n w t of the whole region is constant regardless of c a p a w a s t e i of each wwtp and can be left out of the optimization we also assume that the unit energy of reclaimed water treatment is constant due to the lack of statistical support for otherwise in addition the service pressure of reclaimed water is assumed to be 30 m universally independent of the height of the buildings 3 2 model performance the suwstor is implemented in the c programming language we run the model three times in parallel with the control parameters listed in table s1 the optimization processes converged after 5000 generations taking approximately 17 h on a working station with intel r xeon r e3 1225 cpu compared to the initial random solutions the three test runs achieved at least 31 reduction in capital cost and 86 in operational energy while the range of water reuse capacity remained from 0 100 throughout the optimization indicating that the diversity of the solutions is maintained fig s2 comparing one of the pareto solutions i e solution iii described in section 4 1 and fig 4 to a benchmark solution determined by expert experience depicted in fig s4 while both solutions have re 100 the optimized solution is able to reduce capital cost by 56 million cny 7 of the total cost and operational energy by 1 1 gwh yr 26 of the operational energy in the pipe network 4 results and discussion 4 1 trade off between the objective functions the results of the three model runs are merged and sorted to obtain the final pareto set which contains 500 solutions that are evenly distributed in the objective function space figs 4 and s3 the sorting algorithm is the density based ranking algorithm in zitzler et al 2001 we select five typical solutions from the final pareto set for further illustration of the results which are i the cost optimized solution ii the energy optimized solution iii the cost optimized solution under maximum reuse iv the energy optimized solution under maximum reuse and v the balanced solution their positions in the pareto set are also marked in fig 4 the spatial layout of the wastewater sub system and the reclaimed water sub system of solution v is illustrated in fig 5 while the other solutions are illustrated in fig s5 more capital investment and operational energy is needed when the water reuse capacity increases if we start from the cost optimized solution i and move to the cost optimized solution with re 100 solution iii the price of increasing re from 0 to 100 is 307 million cny 4 79 gwh yr of which 2 19 gwh yr is increased due to the pipe network note that the change from solution i to iii is not achievable if solution i is already constructed because the layout of the wastewater sub system is very different between these two solutions however these differences in cost end energy do represent the lower bound of the expenses in the planning stage on the other hand if we stay on the energy optimized solution i e moving from solution ii to solution iv the price is 110 million cny 4 30 gwh yr of which 1 70 gwh yr is increased due to the pipe network the price when moving from solution ii to solution iv because the energy optimized solution solution ii has a more similar layout as the optimal solutions under re 100 solution iii or iv they both favor a more decentralized layout than the cost optimized solution as indicated by the isoreuse curves fig 4 trade off exists between co and en given the same level of re we can see that the exchange rate from co to en the cost of saving 1 kwh yr energy decreases as the level of re increases the cost of saving 1 kwh yr energy is 276 cny at re 0 by comparing the cost optimized solution i and the energy optimized solution ii at re 100 the exchange rate has decreased to 42 cny per kwh yr by comparing solutions iii and iv this means that energy saving in the system s planning phase is more cost effective at a larger level of water reuse the reason is that in our case study the increase in cost is mainly driven by wastewater treatment fig 6 in all cases while at re 100 energy saving takes place in both wastewater collection and reclaimed water distribution and at re 0 energy saving is only taking place in the wastewater sub system therefore the incentive to save energy at re 100 is much higher than at re 0 4 2 relations between system s attributes and the objective functions we select seven attributes for analysis that could relate to the system s performance these attributes include the number of wwtps nwwtp the difference between the maximal and minimal capacity of the wwtps range capawwtp the average sewage pipe diameter ave dwaste the total length of sewage pipes sum lwaste the number of sewage pumps npump the total output power of sewage pumps sum ppump and the total length of reclaimed water pipes sum lreuse for the five typical solutions these attributes are plotted together with the three objective functions co en re in fig 7 nwwtp measures the degree of centralization of the uws which is an important factor in the uws layout design according to previous studies eggimann et al 2015 we find that nwwtp indeed affects all of the three design objectives in our case the cost optimized solution i favor a more centralized layout with optimal nwwtp 5 average wwtp capacity 4 8 104 m3 day under re 100 the cost optimized solution iii has a more decentralized layout with optimal nwwtp 16 average wwtp capacity 1 5 104 m3 d this means that wastewater reuse requires the optimal wwtp capacity to decrease by at least 68 on the other hand the energy optimized solutions ii and iv both favors the most decentralized layout with optimal nwwtp 26 which is the maximum number of wwtps for the region fig 8 c shows that in our case as the level of water reuse increases the optimal nwwtp is increased if nwwtp does not reach maximum strong negative correlations are found between nwwtp and the following attributes namely range capawwtp ave dwaste sum lwaste for example the energy optimized solutions both with nwwtp 26 have very small range capawwtp ave dwaste and sum lwaste in our case as the system layout becomes decentralized the wwtps tend to have roughly equal capacities the sewage pipes tend to have smaller sizes and the sewer network tends to have shorter length the negative correlation between nwwtp and range capawwtp also indicates that when nwwtp is small the optimization model does not always favor a set of similar wwtp capacities as the law of economies of scale might suggest the capacities of the wwtps could differ greatly depending on the topological structure of the base graph g or the locations of reclaimed water users etc meantime the two attributes related to sewage pumps npump and sum ppump are not correlated with nwwtp nor with any of the objectives for example the cost optimized solutions i and iii have quite different nwwtp but their npump and sum ppump are similar npump and sum ppump are also not correlated with the total operational energy en this is because the attributes related to sewage pumps only describe the energy consumption in the wastewater sub system while the reclaimed water sub system is also an important contributor finally and not surprisingly sum lreuse is strongly correlated to water reuse capacity re 4 3 global vs local optimization to illustrate the necessity of global optimization in the uws layout design we compare the results of suwstor to local optimization results and random solutions for each solution in the final pareto set as described above a locally optimized solution and a random solution are generated both having the same water reuse capacity as the pareto solution the locally optimized solutions are designed to have the same wwtps locations as their corresponding pareto solutions representing the circumstances when only the wwtp locations are optimized all of the other configurations in the locally optimized solutions and the completely random solutions are both determined by running the solution formation module of the suwstor with the pheromone fixed at their initial values fig 9 shows the percentage change in cost and energy of each solution compared to the non optimized solutions in general the pareto solutions i e global optimization results significantly outperforms the local optimization results the latter has a decrease in total cost and transportational energy of 20 and 68 respectively while the pareto solutions achieved a 35 and 98 decrease furthermore the local optimization results only outperforms the random solutions at the lower level of water reuse capacity roughly at re 30 at higher water reuse levels the effect of local optimization fixing wwtps locations alone is negligible or even negative without optimizing the network layout correspondingly this strikes the importance of global optimization especially when the water reuse sub system is in place 4 4 limitations regarding the function of suwstor the building or household scale onsite treatment is an important form of decentralized uws but it is not explicitly included in the model as an option to date it is not easy to estimate the capital cost and energy consumption of onsite treatment because they should not only include those of the treatment facilities but also those related to transportation usually by truck e g eggimann et al 2016 regarding the results and discussion almost all conclusions on the optimal number of wwtps are case specific since both economies of scale and diseconomies of scale exist in the system the optimal degree of centralization heavily depends on the cost functions of the two sub systems presumably the optimal n wwtp will increase if the unit cost of the sewer network is increased and vice versa the same applies to the empirical functions used to calculate the design objectives therefore it is highly recommended that the coefficients in the objective functions should be carefully decided to suit the case area where the model is applied the technology of wastewater or reclaimed water treatment is also an important factor in uws s decentralization which is not considered in the case study however since the smallest wwtp capacity is larger than 5000 m3 day in our case study it is acceptable to assume that the same treatment technology is applied across the whole system if the consideration for different technologies is needed the model user can simply provide a step function to describe the cost and energy consumption of different treatment technologies under different wwtp capacities for the suwstor to consider this factor the goal of our study is to provide a tool for the discussion of the characteristics of optimal uws solutions for any given area although only the capital cost operational energy consumption and water reuse capacity are considered in this model more design objectives such as the impact on receiving waters life cycle energy consumption or greenhouse gas emission system reliability and resilience etc can be easily fit into our model as long as the model user provides the functional relation between these objectives and the model variables eggimann et al 2018 points out that population density significantly affects the optimal degree of centralization while our study only provides the optimal system configuration for a fixed population density a comparison of the characteristics of the optimal system configurations across a wide range of case areas with different population density different reclaimed water demand different technology choices and or under different design objectives would be interesting points for further studies last but not least a common short coming for all aco base algorithms is that their performance heavily depends on the hyperparameters table s1 zheng et al 2017 a better combination of these parameters might exist than that used in this study future work may focus on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm by for example applying an adaptively strategy on the hyperparameters tuning bouzbita et al 2016 5 conclusion designing an integrated urban wastewater and reuse system is a highly constrained non linear optimization problem this has resulted in some difficulties in the debate on system centralization and decentralization in this paper an integrated model for multi objective optimal design of uwss suwstor is built to tackle this problem while requiring only a limited amount of data as input this model is able to simultaneously optimize three major aspect of an integrated uws namely the locations of wwtps the layout of the pipelines and the locations of reclaimed water users compared to the result where only the locations of wwtps are optimized without a global optimization of both wwtps and sewage network our model is able to reduce the capital cost by 15 and operational energy consumption by 30 provide pareto optimal solutions under three objectives i e capital cost energy consumption and water reuse capacity in our case the pareto optimal solutions outperform the expert solution by 7 26 in terms of cost and energy while maintaining the same level of water reuse obtain satisfying result within an acceptable amount of time where for a 100 square kilometer highly populated case area the model took 17 h to complete this model provides a powerful tool to address the question on system centralization and decentralization in various scenarios we look forward that by applying this model to more and more case areas some general relations can be found on the optimal system configuration the design criteria and the geographical and demographical properties of the case area during this study we notice that the idea behind the algorithm for suwstor i e to formulate the uws design process as a multi step decision making problem so as to be fit into the aco algorithm can be extended to the design of storm sewer systems either with or without decentralized low impact development lid facilities or the design of an integrated uws with source separation and on site treatment therefore more attention should be drawn to the application of this family of algorithms in the field of urban water system planning in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

14925,decentralization is recognized as an emerging solution for a more sustainable urban wastewater system uws for the future however the debate of centralization vs decentralization at the system s planning stage remains unresolved mainly due to the complexity of the system s spatial structure and the multiple design objectives such as water reuse and energy conservation this paper presents the sustainable urban wastewater system generator suwstor as a tool to address this issue integrating a graph representation of the system structure and the ant colony algorithm suwstor can produce pareto optimal solutions for system design under three objectives minimizing the capital cost minimizing the operational energy consumption and maximizing the water reuse capacity the model is used for

discussed for any given area in our case study the optimal capacity of wwtps for the lowest cost solution is 48 000 m3 per day leading to a total number of wwtps of 5 as the water reuse level increases to maximum the optimal capacity reduces to 15 000 m3 per day where the number of wwtps is 16 the model is also able to perform significantly better than the locally optimized results in which only the wwtp locations are fixed at their optimal values this demonstrates the importance of a global optimization model in designing the integrated uws graphical abstract image graphical

centralization versus decentralization in urban wastewater systems uws began at the end of the 20th century anderson 1996 otterpohl et al 1997 van lier and lettinga 1999 the core question of this debate is how many wastewater treatment plants wwtp should be built in a given area and relatedly what the optimal size of a wwtp is libralato et al 2012 for a long time the focus has been solely on the wwtp itself to determine the optimal size driven by economies of scale and the requirement of a more stable influent it has been common practice to build a centralized wwtp resulting in a relatively larger treatment scale recently this approach is questioned for several reasons firstly unlike the economies of scale in wastewater treatment diseconomies of scale generally exist in the construction of sewer networks and their construction costs can take up more than 80 of the system s total investment costs in some cases eggimann et al 2015 secondly along with technological advances better and more stable performance in pollutant removal is no longer the exclusive advantage of large wwtps smaller wwtps can achieve similar results rahm et al 2018 moreover when sustainability related design objectives are considered such as water recycling energy saving flexibility and or resilience the advantages of a decentralized layout are pointed out by more and more studies weber et al 2007 daigger 2009 gikas and tchobanoglous 2009 libralato et al 2012 maurer 2013 tchobanoglous and leverenz 2013 roefs et al 2017 garrido baserba et al 2018 leigh and lee 2019 gude 2021 gul et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 therefore the degree of centralization or decentralization of wastewater systems is an issue that cannot be avoided as we think about the future sustainable urban water infrastructure especially as the concept of infrastructure resilience becomes increasingly accepted discernment of this debate is necessary for developing countries with inadequate infrastructure and equally crucial for developed countries facing infrastructure renewal in the past two decades case studies and scenario analyses have been carried out to assess the pros and cons of the decentralized uws libralato et al 2012 however these studies consider only the technological aspect of decentralization and have no regard for the change in uws s spatial layout e g garrido baserba et al 2018 after all it is difficult to discuss the spatial layout of uws in a limited number of scenarios for example opher and friedler 2016 assess the life cycle environmental impacts of four uws configurations for a city in israel the results show that the decentralized configuration prevails due to the fewer materials and energy consumed in the reclaimed water supply however the hypothetical system configurations considered in this study include only the two extremes one being the whole city equipped with decentralized greywater reuse systems at the building or household scale and the other being a centralized water reuse system with one large wwtp since a hybrid centralized decentralized configuration is often subject to many uncertain factors these scenario based studies commonly fail to answer whether a hybrid configuration performs better than the centralized or decentralized extreme virtual case generators moderl et al 2009 urich et al 2010 duque et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 and spatial optimization models are viable tools to increase the number of scenarios and discuss centralization versus decentralization a large group of spatial optimization models optimize the sewer network route and sizes with only one wwtp haghighi and bakhshipour 2012 2015 moeini and afshar 2012 2019 these models are not able to address the debate on centralization or decentralization cunha et al 2009 represent one of the early models to optimize the number and locations of wwtps and their respective sewer networks the model assumes that the sewage pipes follow straight lines between the region s population centres this relatively simple generalization of the network topology enables efficient calculation so that their model can be applied to an area of more than 1000 square km eggimann et al 2015 use a greedy algorithm to iteratively decide for each wastewater discharging unit whether to connect to an existing wwtp or to construct a new one thus the model can decide the optimal degree of centralization i e the number of wwtps jung et al 2018 combine the random sampling algorithm for the locations of wwtps and the dijkstra algorithm dijkstra 1959 for the sewer network in their case the system s life cycle cost generally increases with the number of wwtps spatial optimization models are also applied to the route of the reclaimed water system including determining the size of reclaimed water treatment facilities and the route of the reclaimed water pipe network lee et al 2016 dev et al 2021 liu et al 2021 the discussion of the degree of centralization and decentralization of uwss using spatial optimization models also evolves towards multidimensional decision objectives for example the model of cunha et al 2009 is extended to include receiving water quality zeferino et al 2010 or reliability zeferino et al 2014 as the additional objective for siting and sizing of wwtps at the watershed scale kavvada et al 2016 compares the impact of centralized and decentralized uwss on wastewater reuse in terms of life cycle cost and greenhouse emission kavvada et al 2018 integrates the construction cost operational energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission of uwss into an objective function to optimize the location and size of wwtps and the route of the sewer network in an urban area dong et al 2012 developed a pareto optimization model for the spatial layout optimization of wastewater and reclaimed water systems considering life cycle cost pollution load discharged to receiving water and the proportion of wastewater reuse bakhshipour et al 2021 zahediasl et al 2021 and hesarkazzazi et al 2022 represent the latest studies on system decentralization using optimization models and multi dimensional decision making they developed graph based heuristic algorithm to generate near optimal solutions for stormwater systems and green infrastructure bakhshipour et al 2021 show that in stormwater systems when only the conventional pipe system is considered decentralization is always preferable as it benefits both system s cost and resilience whereas trade off exists between these two objectives when we consider the scale of green infrastructure we can see from these studies that the optimal degree of centralization is case specific and depends on the choice of design and evaluation criteria based on the above mentioned works we find that the established spatial optimization models are often developed only for the wastewater system or the reclaimed water system separately however there is a strong coupling between these two systems and separated optimization does not describe their interactions sustainability requires a systematic perspective to optimize the performance of urban water infrastructures and the current separated optimization practices are not consistent with it in addition a multi objective pareto optimization enables a new perspective which allows us to identify the impact of centralization and decentralization on the trade off relationship among multiple performances of the uwss such work will provide us with new knowledge for designing future uwss in the framework of sustainable development therefore to provide the tool for discussing centralization versus decentralization of the uwss we establish a global multi objective optimization model the sustainable urban wastewater system generator suwstor the model can generate the pareto optimal solutions of uwss with consideration of capital cost operational energy consumption and water reuse capacity each solution contains the number locations and capacities of the wwtps including reclaimed water treatment and the route and the hydraulic parameters of both the sewer and reclaimed water pipe network in section 2 the input output objective functions constraints and optimization algorithm of suwstor will be introduced section 3 describes the case area where the model is tested and the model s performance section 4 provides case specific results on the system s optimal degree of centralization and discusses the model s advantages and limitations finally section 5 will provide some conclusions 2 method 2 1 input of suwstor the input of the suwstor can be described as an undirected graph g along with some attributes of its nodes and edges the edges represent the potential routes for the sewer pipelines and the reclaimed water pipelines which can but does not have to be obtained from the road network in an urban area the length of the edges l i should be provided by the model user the nodes serve as potential junction nodes of the sewer network or reclaimed water network their elevation e l e v i should be provided a subset of the nodes represents system users when there is wastewater discharge or reclaimed water demand the quantity of wastewater q i w a s t e or reclaimed water q i r e u s e at these nodes should be provided another subset of the nodes represents potential locations of the wwtps the maximum area available to construct a wwtp at these nodes should be provided if there is such a restriction the required input attribute of the nodes and edges are listed in table 1 2 2 output of suwstor the output of the suwstor is a sub graph of g denoted gs along with attributes of its nodes and edges the adjacency matrix of gs is denoted by s the edges of gs represent the route of the designed sewage pipelines and the reclaimed water pipelines for simplicity the model uses the same graph gs to represent the route of both the sewage pipelines and the reclaimed water pipelines a list of output can be seen in table 2 the decision variables of the optimization model consist of i the adjacent matrix of gs s ii whether or not a node is supplied with reclaimed water r i iii whether a node is chosen as a wwtp w i any other output information table 2 can be derived from the decision variables 2 3 objective functions the suwstor considers three objectives minimizing the system s capital cost co minimizing the operational energy consumption en and maximizing the water reuse capacity re capital cost co is the sum of four components the cost of wastewater collection c o w c wastewater treatment c o w t reclaimed water treatment c o r t and reclaimed water distribution c o r d eq 1 c o w t is the sum of the capital cost of pipes and pumps the former is a function of

i water quantity balance the capacity of reclaimed water treatment should not be greater than the wastewater inflow times a reduction factor of the wwtp on the same node ii area restrictions the land area required for the construction of the wwtp is not greater than the maximally available area iii topological constraints each system user node should be connected to exactly one wwtp node via a unique route essentially this requires that gs is a sub forest a set of non intersecting sub trees of g iv hydraulic constraints the sewage pipes are gravity flow pipes reclaimed water is distributed through pressure pipes their sizes and slopes must satisfy the hydraulic constraints in the national design code 2 5 the optimization algorithm the suwstor applies the ant colony optimization aco algorithm dorigo and gambardella 1997 to solve the optimization problem the aco algorithm imitates the process of path finding of an ant colony where the ants cooperate to find good solutions e g the shortest path through their communication by pheromone the ant which finds a better solution e g a shorter path leaves more pheromone on its path the pheromone in turn affects the choices of later ants i e the higher the pheromone concentration on a path the more likely an ant will choose it the aco algorithm in suwstor includes the following modules fig 1 a pheromone initialization b solution formation c calculating the objective functions and removing infeasible solutions d non dominated sorting deb et al 2002 e pheromone updating and f stopping after a given number of iterations the algorithm then repeats from module b until it finally stops the algorithm utilizes four pheromone matrices or tensors τ reuse τ n τ wwtp and τ pipe τ n affects how many wwtps are built in the solution τ wwtp affects which locations are more likely to be chosen τ reuse determines the likelihood of each user to be supplied with reclaimed water finally τ pipe affects the ants choice when they are forming the layout of the wastewater and reclaimed water pipelines the structures of the pheromone matrices or tensors are based on the pareto ant colony algorithm developed by doerner et al 2004 for multi objective optimization the rules of pheromone initialization module a and update module e are based on the max min ant system developed by stützle and hoos 2000 more details of pheromone utilization are stated in si section 2 the solution formation module b is a general process through which the ants form a feasible solution under the guidance of the pheromone the process consists of the following steps 1 determine r i i e whether each node is supplied with reclaimed water based on τ reuse 2 determine w i i e which nodes are chosen as wwtp locations first the ant chooses an integer n between 1 and nmax the total number of potential locations of wwtps based on τ n then the ant iteratively takes a location from the remaining unchosen locations based on τ wwtp until the total number of wwtps reaches n 3 determine s i e the layout of the pipelines gosavi et al 2003 developed a process for ants to form a sub tree in a graph their process is modified here to suit the constraints in designing the uws s layout firstly one ant is placed on each of the system user nodes i e nodes with either wastewater discharge or reclaimed water demand or both secondly shuffle the order in which the ants will move then each ant iteratively moves to an adjacent node which is not on its previous path the choice of their next node is affected by τ pipe and a heuristic information η pipe calculated from the slope between each pair of adjacent nodes if there are no feasible next nodes after the ant moves re placed it to a random node on its previous path which has at least one feasible next node next check if the ants meet the stopping condition when an ant reaches a node on another ant s path the ant is terminated and its path is appended to the other ant s path when an ant reaches a node chosen for wwtps it is terminated finally when all non terminated ants have moved for once the order of the ants is re shuffled and the procedure is repeated until all ants are terminated the detailed formula on how the pheromone matrices or tensors affect the ants choices in these steps are described in si section 2 and specifically an example is provided in si section 2 5 some locations of wwtps chosen in step 2 might not be reached by any ants in step 3 these locations are removed from the solution finally a forest with nwwtp nwwtp n trees is formed as s where nwwtp is the final number of wwtps 3 case study 3 1 case area description we apply our model in xiong an new district china it is located in hebei province less than 200 km south to the nation s capital beijing and is one of the nation s most ambitious urbanization projects of the new millennium fig 2 according to plan around 1 million residents are going to dwell in an area of 100 km2s management committee of xiong an new district 2020 the region is planned to be dominated by residence and commerce each occupy approximately 20 and 80 of the built up areas except for green spaces the topography of the region is almost flat with a maximum elevation difference of 4 m the graph g of the case area consists of 498 nodes and 839 edges 26 potential locations for wwtps are identified by the decision maker fig 3 wastewater discharge is estimated as 50 m3 d ha for residential users and 60 m3 d ha for commercial users resulting in a total wastewater discharge of 2 4 105 m3 day according to decision makers the reclaimed water demand only includes toilet flushing for non residential users which is 10 m3 d ha and totally 3 7 104 m3 day according to the emission standards in china the wwtps should include secondary treatment and nutrient removal advanced treatment should be applied in addition for reclaimed water the coefficients of the empirical functions to estimate the capital cost and operational energy consumption of wwtps are obtained from studies on local data based on these requirements see si section 1 1 for details based on a statistical analysis across more than 4000 wwtps in china we assume that the unit energy energy consumption per cubic meter wastewater of wastewater treatment is uncorrelated to their capacity therefore the energy for wastewater treatment e n w t of the whole region is constant regardless of c a p a w a s t e i of each wwtp and can be left out of the optimization we also assume that the unit energy of reclaimed water treatment is constant due to the lack of statistical support for otherwise in addition the service pressure of reclaimed water is assumed to be 30 m universally independent of the height of the buildings 3 2 model performance the suwstor is implemented in the c programming language we run the model three times in parallel with the control parameters listed in table s1 the optimization processes converged after 5000 generations taking approximately 17 h on a working station with intel r xeon r e3 1225 cpu compared to the initial random solutions the three test runs achieved at least 31 reduction in capital cost and 86 in operational energy while the range of water reuse capacity remained from 0 100 throughout the optimization indicating that the diversity of the solutions is maintained fig s2 comparing one of the pareto solutions i e solution iii described in section 4 1 and fig 4 to a benchmark solution determined by expert experience depicted in fig s4 while both solutions have re 100 the optimized solution is able to reduce capital cost by 56 million cny 7 of the total cost and operational energy by 1 1 gwh yr 26 of the operational energy in the pipe network 4 results and discussion 4 1 trade off between the objective functions the results of the three model runs are merged and sorted to obtain the final pareto set which contains 500 solutions that are evenly distributed in the objective function space figs 4 and s3 the sorting algorithm is the density based ranking algorithm in zitzler et al 2001 we select five typical solutions from the final pareto set for further illustration of the results which are i the cost optimized solution ii the energy optimized solution iii the cost optimized solution under maximum reuse iv the energy optimized solution under maximum reuse and v the balanced solution their positions in the pareto set are also marked in fig 4 the spatial layout of the wastewater sub system and the reclaimed water sub system of solution v is illustrated in fig 5 while the other solutions are illustrated in fig s5 more capital investment and operational energy is needed when the water reuse capacity increases if we start from the cost optimized solution i and move to the cost optimized solution with re 100 solution iii the price of increasing re from 0 to 100 is 307 million cny 4 79 gwh yr of which 2 19 gwh yr is increased due to the pipe network note that the change from solution i to iii is not achievable if solution i is already constructed because the layout of the wastewater sub system is very different between these two solutions however these differences in cost end energy do represent the lower bound of the expenses in the planning stage on the other hand if we stay on the energy optimized solution i e moving from solution ii to solution iv the price is 110 million cny 4 30 gwh yr of which 1 70 gwh yr is increased due to the pipe network the price when moving from solution ii to solution iv because the energy optimized solution solution ii has a more similar layout as the optimal solutions under re 100 solution iii or iv they both favor a more decentralized layout than the cost optimized solution as indicated by the isoreuse curves fig 4 trade off exists between co and en given the same level of re we can see that the exchange rate from co to en the cost of saving 1 kwh yr energy decreases as the level of re increases the cost of saving 1 kwh yr energy is 276 cny at re 0 by comparing the cost optimized solution i and the energy optimized solution ii at re 100 the exchange rate has decreased to 42 cny per kwh yr by comparing solutions iii and iv this means that energy saving in the system s planning phase is more cost effective at a larger level of water reuse the reason is that in our case study the increase in cost is mainly driven by wastewater treatment fig 6 in all cases while at re 100 energy saving takes place in both wastewater collection and reclaimed water distribution and at re 0 energy saving is only taking place in the wastewater sub system therefore the incentive to save energy at re 100 is much higher than at re 0 4 2 relations between system s attributes and the objective functions we select seven attributes for analysis that could relate to the system s performance these attributes include the number of wwtps nwwtp the difference between the maximal and minimal capacity of the wwtps range capawwtp the average sewage pipe diameter ave dwaste the total length of sewage pipes sum lwaste the number of sewage pumps npump the total output power of sewage pumps sum ppump and the total length of reclaimed water pipes sum lreuse for the five typical solutions these attributes are plotted together with the three objective functions co en re in fig 7 nwwtp measures the degree of centralization of the uws which is an important factor in the uws layout design according to previous studies eggimann et al 2015 we find that nwwtp indeed affects all of the three design objectives in our case the cost optimized solution i favor a more centralized layout with optimal nwwtp 5 average wwtp capacity 4 8 104 m3 day under re 100 the cost optimized solution iii has a more decentralized layout with optimal nwwtp 16 average wwtp capacity 1 5 104 m3 d this means that wastewater reuse requires the optimal wwtp capacity to decrease by at least 68 on the other hand the energy optimized solutions ii and iv both favors the most decentralized layout with optimal nwwtp 26 which is the maximum number of wwtps for the region fig 8 c shows that in our case as the level of water reuse increases the optimal nwwtp is increased if nwwtp does not reach maximum strong negative correlations are found between nwwtp and the following attributes namely range capawwtp ave dwaste sum lwaste for example the energy optimized solutions both with nwwtp 26 have very small range capawwtp ave dwaste and sum lwaste in our case as the system layout becomes decentralized the wwtps tend to have roughly equal capacities the sewage pipes tend to have smaller sizes and the sewer network tends to have shorter length the negative correlation between nwwtp and range capawwtp also indicates that when nwwtp is small the optimization model does not always favor a set of similar wwtp capacities as the law of economies of scale might suggest the capacities of the wwtps could differ greatly depending on the topological structure of the base graph g or the locations of reclaimed water users etc meantime the two attributes related to sewage pumps npump and sum ppump are not correlated with nwwtp nor with any of the objectives for example the cost optimized solutions i and iii have quite different nwwtp but their npump and sum ppump are similar npump and sum ppump are also not correlated with the total operational energy en this is because the attributes related to sewage pumps only describe the energy consumption in the wastewater sub system while the reclaimed water sub system is also an important contributor finally and not surprisingly sum lreuse is strongly correlated to water reuse capacity re 4 3 global vs local optimization to illustrate the necessity of global optimization in the uws layout design we compare the results of suwstor to local optimization results and random solutions for each solution in the final pareto set as described above a locally optimized solution and a random solution are generated both having the same water reuse capacity as the pareto solution the locally optimized solutions are designed to have the same wwtps locations as their corresponding pareto solutions representing the circumstances when only the wwtp locations are optimized all of the other configurations in the locally optimized solutions and the completely random solutions are both determined by running the solution formation module of the suwstor with the pheromone fixed at their initial values fig 9 shows the percentage change in cost and energy of each solution compared to the non optimized solutions in general the pareto solutions i e global optimization results significantly outperforms the local optimization results the latter has a decrease in total cost and transportational energy of 20 and 68 respectively while the pareto solutions achieved a 35 and 98 decrease furthermore the local optimization results only outperforms the random solutions at the lower level of water reuse capacity roughly at re 30 at higher water reuse levels the effect of local optimization fixing wwtps locations alone is negligible or even negative without optimizing the network layout correspondingly this strikes the importance of global optimization especially when the water reuse sub system is in place 4 4 limitations regarding the function of suwstor the building or household scale onsite treatment is an important form of decentralized uws but it is not explicitly included in the model as an option to date it is not easy to estimate the capital cost and energy consumption of onsite treatment because they should not only include those of the treatment facilities but also those related to transportation usually by truck e g eggimann et al 2016 regarding the results and discussion almost all conclusions on the optimal number of wwtps are case specific since both economies of scale and diseconomies of scale exist in the system the optimal degree of centralization heavily depends on the cost functions of the two sub systems presumably the optimal n wwtp will increase if the unit cost of the sewer network is increased and vice versa the same applies to the empirical functions used to calculate the design objectives therefore it is highly recommended that the coefficients in the objective functions should be carefully decided to suit the case area where the model is applied the technology of wastewater or reclaimed water treatment is also an important factor in uws s decentralization which is not considered in the case study however since the smallest wwtp capacity is larger than 5000 m3 day in our case study it is acceptable to assume that the same treatment technology is applied across the whole system if the consideration for different technologies is needed the model user can simply provide a step function to describe the cost and energy consumption of different treatment technologies under different wwtp capacities for the suwstor to consider this factor the goal of our study is to provide a tool for the discussion of the characteristics of optimal uws solutions for any given area although only the capital cost operational energy consumption and water reuse capacity are considered in this model more design objectives such as the impact on receiving waters life cycle energy consumption or greenhouse gas emission system reliability and resilience etc can be easily fit into our model as long as the model user provides the functional relation between these objectives and the model variables eggimann et al 2018 points out that population density significantly affects the optimal degree of centralization while our study only provides the optimal system configuration for a fixed population density a comparison of the characteristics of the optimal system configurations across a wide range of case areas with different population density different reclaimed water demand different technology choices and or under different design objectives would be interesting points for further studies last but not least a common short coming for all aco base algorithms is that their performance heavily depends on the hyperparameters table s1 zheng et al 2017 a better combination of these parameters might exist than that used in this study future work may focus on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm by for example applying an adaptively strategy on the hyperparameters tuning bouzbita et al 2016 5 conclusion designing an integrated urban wastewater and reuse system is a highly constrained non linear optimization problem this has resulted in some difficulties in the debate on system centralization and decentralization in this paper an integrated model for multi objective optimal design of uwss suwstor is built to tackle this problem while requiring only a limited amount of data as input this model is able to simultaneously optimize three major aspect of an integrated uws namely the locations of wwtps the layout of the pipelines and the locations of reclaimed water users compared to the result where only the locations of wwtps are optimized without a global optimization of both wwtps and sewage network our model is able to reduce the capital cost by 15 and operational energy consumption by 30 provide pareto optimal solutions under three objectives i e capital cost energy consumption and water reuse capacity in our case the pareto optimal solutions outperform the expert solution by 7 26 in terms of cost and energy while maintaining the same level of water reuse obtain satisfying result within an acceptable amount of time where for a 100 square kilometer highly populated case area the model took 17 h to complete this model provides a powerful tool to address the question on system centralization and decentralization in various scenarios we look forward that by applying this model to more and more case areas some general relations can be found on the optimal system configuration the design criteria and the geographical and demographical properties of the case area during this study we notice that the idea behind the algorithm for suwstor i e to formulate the uws design process as a multi step decision making problem so as to be fit into the aco algorithm can be extended to the design of storm sewer systems either with or without decentralized low impact development lid facilities or the design of an integrated uws with source separation and on site treatment therefore more attention should be drawn to the application of this family of algorithms in the field of urban water system planning in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

14926,biofilters inoculated with activated sludge are widely used for odor control in wwtp in this process biofilm community evolution plays an important role in the function of reactor and is closely related to reactor performance however the trade offs in biofilm community and bioreactor function during the operation are still unclear herein an artificially constructed biofilter for odorous gas treatment was operated for 105 days to study the trade offs in the biofilm community and function biofilm colonization was found to drive community evolution during the start up phase phase 1 days 0

wastewater treatment plants wwtps gabriel and deshusses 2003 tang and deshusses 2020 wang et al 2009 in biofilters odorants are converted by microorganisms into carbon and energy sources for microbial growth hu et al 2015 wang et al 2021 the biofilm community formed by microorganisms attached to the substrate surface affects the overall performance of the biofilter kong et al 2013a zhang et al 2018 therefore it could provide a better understanding of the development to function linkages in wwtp odorant biofiltration treatment processes through tracking biofilm community evolution during the entire operation period of biofilters the overall performance is affected by biofilm characteristics wang et al 2022a yang et al 2020 for example the microbial extracellular polymeric substance eps level increases with reactor operation and increased eps secretion facilitates biofilm adhesion and improves the biofilter start up performance wang et al 2009 wang et al 2022b however clogging caused by excessive eps secretion and biofilm accumulation reduces the operational stability wang et al 2009 wang et al 2022b moreover microbial community succession in biofilms leads to the formation of a heterogeneous and dynamic microscale ecosystem wang et al 2019 yuan et al 2021 the functions of different species in the community contribute to intricate interspecies interactions and closely affect the operation of biofilters deng et al 2012 he et al 2010 yuan et al 2021 at the microscale dominant species are constantly evolving and play different roles at different times because of the heterogeneity of living space and limited ecological niches brislawn et al 2019 leventhal et al 2018 morgenroth and milferstedt 2009 yuan et al 2021 reports have indicated that the functions of the biofilm community are locally dominated by a few species however the dominant species show substantial variation at the temporal scale leventhal et al 2018 schiettekatte et al 2022 zhou et al 2013 therefore it can be expected that no community can maximize all functions in biofilters and it is necessary to reveal the changing process of communities and functions in biofilters furthermore microbial communication such as interspecific cooperation and competition is also dynamically altered during the development of biofilters zhou et al 2013 however few studies have focused on the function of biofilm community interactions in gas biofilters due to its long term presence in the gas solid phase a community s composition may be affected by various factors such as adhesion between the biofilm and carrier and the impact of airflow wang et al 2009 yuan et al 2021 in addition the biofilm community might be also affected by the reduction in filter bed porosity and the living space of microorganisms during long term operation zhou et al 2013 however it is still poorly understood about the biofilm community structure and evolutionary factors at different phases in gas biofilters therefore a better understanding should be developed of the role of the microbial community in different phases and the evolution of species communication to maintain the operational stability of gas biofilters quorum sensing qs plays a role in bacteria to bacteria communication in biofilm based bioreactors whiteley et al 2017 yuan et al 2021 qs refers to the phenomenon in which bacteria self produce signal molecules and accumulate them to a level that regulates gene expression huws et al 2021 whalen et al 2019 previous studies have reported that qs drives the biofilm formation process and is closely related to bioreactor performance huang et al 2016 lee et al 2018 whalen et al 2019 it was reported that the activity of bacteria was significantly enhanced by the induction of exogenous signaling molecules tang et al 2018a sun et al 2022 quorum quenching qq a strategy to degrade signal molecules to inhibit qs behavior has also been found to be important for maintaining biofilm stability kim et al 2013 wang et al 2022a whiteley et al 2017 xu et al 2020a and it persists longer than qs activity in aerobic granules li et al 2020b whiteley et al 2017 therefore a dynamic evolution of qs and qq behavior could be expected in biofilm based biofilters however the effect of microbial communication evolution on biofilm communities and bioreactor operations is poorly understood moreover whether the performance of the bioreactor can have a reverse influence on microbial communication should be better understood specifically it poorly known that the effect of clogging caused by excessive accumulation of biofilm in gas biofilters on the balance between qs and qq activity therefore the link between microbial community communication evolution and bioreactor biofilm status cannot be ignored and deeper insights into qs and qq during start up and successive long term operation of bioreactors would be helpful for developing a qs based strategy to regulate performance in this study a laboratory scale gas biofilter was established to study the evolution of the microbial community structure during bioreactor operation to capture the changes and functions of the dominant flora at different developmental stages the biofilter was divided into three stages according to operating performance and biomass accumulation start up stable operation and clogging high throughput sequencing analysis and functional gene prediction were combined to comprehensively capture the characteristics and functions of the biofilm communities the relative abundance of qs and qq related bacteria was quantified by building a local database furthermore the association between qs and qq based bacterial communication in bioreactor pollutant removal and biomass accumulation was compared using a correlation analysis the results offer deeper insights into the trade offs in microbial community evolution and bioreactor operation revealing the critical role of the qs based bacterial communication system 2 materials and methods 2 1 biofilter operation one lab scale biofilter was established as acrylic cylinder with a total volume of 1 3 l inner diameter of 6 cm and 45 cm

used as inoculated sludge as described by wang et al wang et al 2022b the schematic diagram of biofiltration odor treatment process was shown in figure s1 nutrient solution was regularly sprayed for sufficient humidity and nutrients from the top into the biofilter its formula is shown in table s1 2 2 dna extraction and high throughput sequencing analysis biofilm samples from the substrate surface

vibration conditions using phosphate buffer solution 0 01 m ph 7 2 as the solution afterwards an e z n a stool dna kit d4015 omega inc usa was used to extract dna from the biofilm samples according to the manufacturer s instructions nuclear free water was used as a blank the v3 v4 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified using primers 341f 5 cctacgggnggcwgcag 3 and 805r 5 gactachvgggtatctaatcc 3 polymerase chain reaction pcr was conducted as previously described xu et al 2019 wang et al 2022c and the products were confirmed by 2 agarose gel electrophoresis afterwards the pcr products were purified and quantified using ampure xt beads beckman coulter genomics danvers ma usa and qubit invitrogen usa amplicons were then used for high throughput sequencing on the novaseq pe250 platform at lc bio technology co ltd hang zhou zhejiang province china operational taxonomic units otus were identified using the uparse function within usearch the raw reads obtained from the samples were deposited in the ncbi genbank accession number prjna851523 alpha diversity observed otus shannon diversity index and pielou s evenness index was calculated using qiime2 which randomly extracted the same number of sequences by reducing the number of sequences to the minimum of some samples and the relative abundance x bacteria count total count was used for the bacterial taxonomy differentially expressed genera in different samples were analyzed using the r package venndiagram version 1 6 20 the differences in microbial communities between the groups were calculated based on the bray curtis algorithm and an analysis of similarities anosim matrix was obtained function predictions were performed using bugbase while predictions of qs and qq related gene expression were performed with picrust2 the biomarkers in biofilm samples were identified through linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse analysis which was performed using a cloud platform https www omicstudio cn tool 60 the p value threshold of the wilcoxon test was set to 0 05 and the lda log score threshold was set to 4 0 2 3 establishment of a functional genera database to assess the evolution of qs and qq related genera a uniprotkb based local qs and qq database was established xu et al 2020b keywords such as quorum sensing autoinducer and accessory gene regulator were searched on uniprotkb and then the related genera were integrated to form a qs local database hong et al 2016 xu et al 2020b in addition a qq local database was formed by searching keywords such as quorum quenching acylase and lactonase on uniprotkb the community taxonomy obtained from high throughput sequencing was compared in a local database and qs and qq related genera were screened for subsequent analysis related qs function genes that have been previously reported were selected to explore the role of bacterial communication in the biofilm community tang et al 2018a specifically the relative abundance of the luxs cqsa luxi and rpff genes and luxr family genes in the microbial samples was analyzed using functional gene prediction to represent qs behavior miller and bassler 2001 tang et al 2018b waters and bassler 2005 whiteley et al 2017 moreover lactonase and acylase were selected to represent qq according to their enzymatic mechanisms dong and zhang 2005 for the degradation of the target pollutant gaseous toluene a local database of toluene degradation genera was constructed by searching the keywords monooxygenase and dioxygenase parales et al 2000 in uniprotkb qs qq and toluene degradation related genera in the database can be found in supplementary material excel s1 s3 the top 15 genera in terms of relative abundance in the different biofilm samples were considered core genera for further analysis huang et al 2021 2 4 analytical methods a gas chromatograph gc7900 tianmei china with a flame ionization detector and capillary column was used to quantify the inlet and outlet gaseous toluene concentrations the water displacement method was used to quantify the porosity ε of the filter bed han et al 2020 the biomass accumulation inside the biofilter was intermittently measured using an electronic scale kaifeng 968 kaifeng group co ltd china according to wang et al wang et al 2009 a piezometer jjg540 88 bolaite shanghai china was used to measure the pressure drop in the filter bed to evaluate the clogging status the ergun equation was used to fit the relationship between the filter bed pressure drop and flow rate parameter α was used to represent the clogging status wang et al 2022b the porosity ε and clogging status of the filter bed were used to evaluate the living space of the biofilm community the eps secreted from the microbes was analyzed using the heat extraction method the biofilm samples collected from the biofilter were washed three times using phosphate buffered saline pbs ph 7 0 and then pretreated by ultrasonication wang et al 2022a the lowry method and phenol sulfuric acid method were used to determine the proteins and polysaccharides bovine serum albumin solarbio co ltd beijing china and glucose yuanli chemical co ltd tianjin china were used as the standards each result was obtained from the average values of the three parallel samples ahl production was tested based on the chromogenic reaction between a tumefaciens a136 provided by seoul national university and ahls huang et al 2016 li et al 2020b 2 5 statistical analysis the analysis of variance anova using spss 19 0 was used for the statistic differences of eps secretion overall performance and genera relative abundance p 0 05 was considered to be significant differences the correlation fitting is done in origin 8 0 3 results 3 1 development of the gas biofilter in this study the removal efficiencies of gaseous toluene and pressure drop which were used to evaluate the overall performance during the operation were used to divide the biofilter development process table s2 during the first 25 days although the removal efficiencies climbed to 80 the pressure drop showed no obvious increasing trend meanwhile removal efficiency began to fluctuate down and pressure drop increased sharply after day 80 fig 1 therefore the biofilter development process was divided into three distinct phases start up phase 1 days 0 25 stable operation phase 2 days 26 80 and clogging phase 3 days 81 105 as shown in fig 1 the inlet concentration of gaseous toluene during the entire operation was 400 200 mg m3 whereas the outlet concentration showed differences in various phases in phase 1 the outlet concentration decreased with time and was below 50 mg m3 on day 25 in addition the removal efficiencies of gaseous toluene increased to above 80 indicating that the biofilter was successfully activated moreover the biomass accumulated from a 50 kg biomass m3 filter bed to a 110 kg biomass m3 filter bed at the end of phase 1 and the pressure drop of the filter bed was maintained below 20 pa m fig 1b these findings were consistent with that of previous studies showing that the successful start up of the bioreactor was accomplished by the accumulation of biomass and the process of microbial domestication wang et al 2009 yuan et al 2021 in phase 2 the removal efficiency remained above 80 and was stable until 80 days biomass accumulation also increased at the end of phase 2 and reached 160 kg biomass m3 filter bed meanwhile the accumulation rate decreased compared to that in phase 1 suggesting that the biofilm remained in a stable development stage after rapid accumulation in the start up stage in addition the pressure drop also showed a lower growth rate compared to that in phase 1 and increased to 58 pa m on day 80 in phase 3 days 81 105 the biomass did not show a rapid accumulation rate and the value was only 10 kg biomass m3 filter bed higher than that at the end of phase 2 fig 1b however the removal efficiency of the biofilter fluctuated and decreased to 60 on day 105 fig 1a and the pressure drop increased to 110 pa m this indicated that the continuous accumulation of biomass deteriorated the filter bed structure reduced the airflow channels and increased the pressure drop according to previous studies delhoménie et al 2003 dorado et al 2012 excessive accumulation of biomass leads to clogging of the filter bed which decreases the performance of the biofilter the eps content also showed a similar trend because both proteins and polysaccharides were significantly elevated at day 90 compared to that at days 25 and 45 p 0 05 figure s2 a dense biofilm structure forms because of excessive eps secretion which affects microbial interactions in the biofilm van loosdrecht et al 1987 xu et al 2020a the status of the filter was also confirmed by the porosity results and ergun equation as shown in figure s3a the initial porosity of the filter bed phase 1 was 0 45 and decreased to 0 34 in phase 3 suggesting that the space was occupied by the excessively accumulated biomass moreover the change in parameter α from the ergun equation from 0 29 in day 25 to 0 93 in day 90 reflects the decrease of airflow channel caused by the reduce of porosity figure s3b table s3 these results suggest that the space of the filter bed decreases with time which might lead to a change in the living environment of microorganisms because the bioreactor is also a micro ecosystem xu et al 2019 yuan et al 2021 3 2 bacterial community succession during the operation the observed otus differed throughout the operation compared to phase 1 day 25 496 otus the observed otus decreased in phase 2 day 45 401 otus figure s3 suggesting a potential selection of the biofilm community on the filter the venn diagram showed that 60 microbial genera existed independently on day 25 whereas this value decreased to 26 on day 45 indicating that a number of genera disappeared after the start up phase fig 2 b in addition the biodiversity of biofilms increased at day 45 and was accompanied by an improvement in pielou s evenness index fig 2c and e this phenomenon demonstrated the priority effect in microbiome assembly in which some pioneers enhance biofilm colonization but disappear during evolution debray et al 2022 yuan et al 2021 moreover local factors such as the continued influx of gaseous organics might drive the evolution of the community from phase 1 to phase 2 which leads to a high removal performance the evolution of the biofilm community during this phase is shown in fig 2 similar to that on day 45 27 microbial genera occurred independently on day 65 fig 2b illustrating that fewer changes in species occurred in phase 2 compared to phase 1 however both the biodiversity and pielou s evenness index of the biofilm community decreased in phase 2 fig 2c and e in this phase the operating performance of the bioreactor remained stable but the biomass increased and porosity decreased fig 1b from day 80 to day 105 phase 3 the small biomass growth indicates that the living space of the microbes in the biofilter had reached the threshold dorado et al 2012 han et al 2020 in this phase the biomass levels remained largely stable and did not grow because of the constant internal space of the biofilter which caused environmental stress living space in the biofilm community yawata et al 2014 interestingly independently occurring genera increased to 56 in phase 3 day 90 while biodiversity and pielou s evenness increased fig 2c and e these results indicating that the increased biodiversity and pielou s evenness might be helpful in response to the environmental stress in the biofilm ecosystems which was also reported in ecology yuan et al 2021 succession of the bacterial community was further observed based on an anosim analysis fig 2d the community in phase 1 had a greater matrix distance from that in phase 3 than it did from that in phase 2 moreover the distance between days 65 and 90 was lower than that between days 45 and 90 these results suggest that the succession of the microbial community was based on the previous stage and might have been affected by real time environmental factors morgenroth and milferstedt 2009 song et al 2022 tang et al 2018a differences in the relative abundance of core genera in the three phases validated the evolution of biofilm communities fig 2a genera associated with biofilm formation eps secretion and biofilm adhesion showed high relative abundance at phase 1 such as burkholderia dyella and mycobacterium figure s5 and s6 suggesting that biofilm colonization drives community construction chakraborty and kumar 2019 d angelo picard et al 2005 kong et al 2013b pallud et al 2001 however genera that present a great ability to degrade aromatic compounds dominated phase 2 such as rhodanobacter gordonia acidocella and sphingomonas bracher et al 2015 deng et al 2015 joyyi et al 2017 sowani et al 2019 interestingly the relative abundance of the genera that maintained biofilm stability and presented extremely competitive behavior increased in phase 3 for example tm7a cannot be cultured but can occur on the surface of host bacteria to obtain energy which inhibits the growth of the host bacteria bor et al 2019 he et al 2015 as a typical pathogen bacillus has a strong adhesion ability but prevents biofilm formation and adhesion of other microorganisms rönner et al 1990 zhang et al 2021 these results suggest that competition for resources might have dominated community evolution in phase 3 3 3 evolution of biomarkers in biofilm communities lefse analysis was used to identify the biomarker species of biofilm communities in different phases biomarkers between different phases during the operation were analyzed as shown in fig 3 and s7 a total of 39 bacterial clades presented statistically significant differences between phase 1 day 25 and phase 2 day 45 with an lda threshold of 4 0 whereas 26 bacterial clades were annotated at phase 2 day 45 figure s7a these findings suggest that biomarkers in the biofilm community had evolved and indicate that the degradation of pollutants and stable operation of the bioreactor were the main functions of the biofilm community in this phase interestingly numerous biomarkers were found between the biofilm community on days 45 and 65 figure s7b suggesting that the community continued to evolve despite a lack of changes in reactor performance this indicates that biomarker species might serve other potential functions in addition to maintaining reactor performance yue et al al 2019 the phylum and genus level biomarkers in the overall biofilm community were screened for a detailed analysis because of their clearer functional annotations tang et al 2018a xu et al 2019 six microbial phyla total relative abundance 95 were identified as biomarkers figure s8 during the succession of the overall biofilm community fig 3c proteobacteria the most widespread phylum in nature contains multiple functions such as pollutant degradation earth cycling and biofilm adhesion and colonization xu et al 2019 yawata et al 2014 zhang et al 2021 and was analyzed as a biomarker in phase 1 fig 3a and c however the biomarkers at the genus level burkholderia and pandoraea showed great potential for eps secretion and biofilm formation leventhal et al 2018 pallud et al 2001 and a high correlation with biomass accumulation rate and porosity fig 3e these results indicate that microbial colonization is a major function of the microbial community in phase 1 moreover the biomarkers at the genus level in phase 2 remained highly correlated with the removal efficiency fig 3c and e indicating that community construction might be dominated by pollutant degradation this finding was consistent with the degradation of aromatic compounds in these genera bracher et al 2015 deng et al 2015 joyyi et al 2017 sowani et al 2019 interestingly the biomarkers analyzed in phase 3 showed extremely low correlation with removal efficiency and biomass accumulation rate fig 3c and e but showed high relative abundance fig 3d stenotrophomonas chryseobacterium and acidisoma are highly resistant to harsh environments garcía et al 2015 khare et al 2020 in addition streptacidiphilus has shown great potential to degrade biopolymers hariharan 2018 these functions of phase 3 biomarkers might represent responses to clogging which limited the living space and forced an increase in genera associated with tolerance and ecosystem stability morgenroth and milferstedt 2009 song et al 2022 yuan et al 2021 in addition most biomarkers were related to qs and qq table s4 indicating that the role of qs based bacterial communication should not be ignored 3 4 evolution of function genera in microbial communities fig 4 shows the evolution of related functional bacterial genera in the microbial community in the biofilters including qs qq and toluene degradation related genera independently occurring qs related genera were analyzed using a venn diagram fig 4a and found to be abundant in phase 1 the high number of qs related genera in phase 1 might be helpful for biofilm colonization dong and zhang 2005 wang et al 2022b previous studies have reported that biofilm formation can be greatly promoted by administering exogenous ahls sun et al 2022 tang et al 2018a this could explain why a high level of ahls was produced in phase 1 fig 4b in phase 2 the relative abundance of toluene degradation related functional microbial genera increased from 14 phase 1 to 58 figure s9 the function of most of the genera such as rhodanobacter rhodobacter acidocella and actinobacteria were reported the function of toluene degradation potential and were core species in phase 2 these core species contributed to the efficient and stable operation of the biofilter therefore the function of the biofilm community shifted from colonization in phase 1 to degradation in phase 2 the qs related genera and qq related genera in phase 3 showed significant differences with increases in qq related genera but decreases in qs related genera fig 4c and d rhodanobacter acidocella rauoultella clostridium and novosphingobium represented typical qs genera and showed high relative abundance in phase 1 and phase 2 but decreased abundance in phase 3 fig 4e dyella gordonia alphaproteobacteria and sphingomonas all showed qq potential and had an increased relative abundance in phase 3 qq gene and protein information can be found in the supporting information fig 4f and figure s10 these results suggest that qq related genera might play a more important role after the long term operation of biofilters than qs related genera a more detailed analysis of the roles of the qq and qs related genera is presented in the next section 3 5 quorum sensing and quorum quenching as the active process in the studied biofilter to further explore the relationship between qs qq behavior and biofilter operation performance a correlation fitting is shown in fig 5 the removal efficiency was statistically analyzed according to the three phases fig 5a and then linearly fitted with the relative abundance of the genera associated with toluene degradation fig 5b a highly correlated fitting relationship r2 0 80 was observed between the two parameters this result suggests that the removal efficiency of the biofilter was highly affected by the pollutant degrading genera interestingly the relative abundance of qs genera also maintained a high correlation with reactor performance removal efficiency r2 0 58 previous studies have shown that increased qs activity in biofilms favors biomass accumulation and promotes the start up of bioreactors sun et al 2022 tang et al 2018a however the decrease in the removal efficiency of the biofilter in phase 3 was accompanied by a decrease in the relative abundance of qs genera indicating that qs might play a role in pollutant degradation afterwards the correlations between the relative abundances of qs genera and toluene degrading genera were fitted fig 5f these two parameters were also highly correlated r2 0 94 which has rarely been reported in previous studies these results suggest that the role of qs in pollutant degradation in bioreactors cannot be ignored signaling molecule synthesis and quenching genes play important roles in bacterial communication and interference which may affect biofilm formation in bioreactors wang et al 2019 xu et al 2020b fig 5e shows the relative abundance evolution of synthesis and quenching genes in biofilms details of the gene description are shown in table s5 and s6 the abundance of synthesis genes was significantly higher than that of quenching genes in phase 1 interestingly the abundance of synthesis genes decreased while the abundance of quenching genes increased with time and these two groups showed no significant differences in phase 3 fig 5e these results suggest that bacterial communication might dominate the construction of biofilm communities in phase 1 because it aids in the colonization and accumulation of biofilms however in phase 3 increased bacterial communication interference may play a major role qq is produced to aid in the competition or promote private benefits of producing cells whiteley et al 2017 therefore the enhanced qq behavior might be more favorable for competitive species survival at the clogging stage in phase 3 moreover a highly positive correlation r2 0 93 was found between the biomass accumulation rate and abundance of synthesis genes fig 5g the highest biomass accumulation rate occurred in phase 1 and decreased with time fig 5d thus confirming the synergistic effect between qs and biofilm formation additionally the biomass accumulation rate was negatively correlated r2 0 87 with the abundance of signaling molecule quenching genes fig 5h confirming the inhibiting effect of qq in biofilm accumulation 4 discussion biofilters are widely used to control odorant pollutants although numerous studies have focused on the performance of bioreactors the evolution and assembly of microbial communities are increasingly being recognized as important factors leventhal et al 2018 tang et al 2018a xu et al 2019 here the trade offs of microbial communities and function at different phases in biofilm based gas biofilters were revealed through 105 days of operation fig 6 4 1 biofilm community and function trade offs at different phase in biofilters although the operational performance in phase 1 was unsatisfactory biomass accumulation was found to be unusually active fig 1 this might be attributed to that the start up of the biofilter begins with the colonization of microorganisms the genera with functions that include eps secretion microbial adhesion and biofilm formation show a high relative abundance fig 2a compared to phase 1 the operational performance was improved in phase 2 but the species diversity declined which illustrates the widespread ecological effects in artificially constructed bioreactors that some pioneers drive colonization of microbial populations but forfeited the priority effect and disappeared during community evolution brislawn et al 2019 yuan et al 2021 in addition the functions of the dominant species have changed consistent with the operational performance the relative abundance of aromatic degrading genera improved rhodanobacter rhodobacter acidocella and actinobacteria which were reported the function of toluene degradation potential figure s9 environmental selection caused by the continuous influx of aromatic compounds gaseous toluene drives the evolution of community functions to maintain community stability and species survival huws et al 2021 leventhal et al 2018 interestingly the operational performance remained highly consistent in phase 2 although the microbial communities at 45 and 65 days still showed differences fig 2 as the biofilter acts as a small fixed ecosystem figure s11 the accumulation of high biomass leads to the degradation of the local environment such as decreased filter bed porosity and decreased airflow channels such changes will have a negative impact on the microbial community therefore the relative abundance of microbes that are resistant to harsh environments begins to increase in phase 3 the operational performance declined as the local environment deteriorated further moreover some genera such as tm7a and bacillus showed extremely competitive behavior and increased relative abundance he et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 in addition streptacidiphilus was reported to degrade biopolymers in biofilms to maintain their competitiveness hariharan 2018 and its relative abundance increased from 0 03 phase 2 to 3 17 phase 3 this finding indicates that with living space limitations pollutant removal is no longer the main function and competition for resources among species dominates the evolution of the community in phase 3 these phenomena have also been reported in membrane bioreactor mbr systems and granular sludge ecosystems tan et al 2014 moreover the clogging caused by excessive biomass accumulation is usually considered to be the main factor leading to a decrease in the performance of gas biofilters delhoménie et al 2003 han et al 2020 however the results of this study suggest that the reduced relative abundance of toluene degrading genera in biofilms might have affected the removal performance in phase 3 the effect of resource competition within the community is amplified when living space is limited debray et al 2022 whiteley et al 2017 some pathogenic bacteria showed a strong competitive potential and seized valuable ecological niches in phase 3 which might have reduced the number of degrading bacteria wang et al 2019 whalen et al 2019 4 2 role of bacteria communication quorum sensing and quorum quenching the evolution of bacteria to bacteria communication was also reflected in this study high ahl production was observed in phase 1 although it decreased with the accumulation of the biofilm qs has been reported to coordinate community assembly and enhance the biofilm formation process whiteley et al 2017 yue et al 2019 although qs related genera presented low relative abundances in phase 1 the high biomass accumulation rate high ahls production and high relative abundance of signaling molecule synthesis genes all demonstrated the important role of these genera figs 4 and 5 the addition of ahls has been reported to improve pollutant removal loading and reduce the start up cycle of anammox systems sun et al 2022 tang et al 2018a however negative effects on granule size by the ahl producing strain were observed li et al 2017 this indicates that the mechanism of action of qs in the ecosystem is not completely unified in this study the relative abundance of qs bacteria and signal molecule synthesis genes decreased whereas the relative abundance of qq bacteria and signal molecule quenching genes increased in phase 3 fig 5 studies have suggested that qq bacteria persist longer than qs bacteria in bioreactors li et al 2020b therefore these results suggest that in addition to the role of qs related genera the role of qq related genera in the evolution of biofilm communities cannot be ignored this study also found a highly positive correlation between signal molecule synthesis genes and the biomass accumulation rate and a highly negative correlation between signal molecule quenching genes and the biomass accumulation rate fig 5 these findings provide theoretical guidance for regulating biofilm formation by the addition of ahl or ahl quenchers 4 3 implications how communities coexist in microbial aggregates is a subject of ongoing research although many studies have focused on interactions between species such as cooperation competition and predation a large number of findings suggest that trade offs in species performance regarding different ecological functions is one of the most common phenomena kneitel and chase 2004 schiettekatte et al 2022 ecologists have found that coral reef fish communities exhibit trade offs in different ecological functions driven by different community structures as a result of global climate change schiettekatte et al 2022 medical scientists have found trade offs in qs between pseudomonas aeruginosa and other species that are more favorable for beneficial clinical consequences luján et al 2022 therefore because of the extensive use of biofilm based reactors for the treatment of environmental pollutants identifying the factors that affect the trade offs in biofilm communities and the associated results is worthy of further study the results of this study demonstrated that biofilm communities exhibit different functional trade offs in the three phases of biofilters because of the different performance requirements these trade offs evolved from the rapid colonization of biofilms phase 1 to the degradation of pollutants phase 2 and competition for resources phase 3 in addition the biofilm community underwent three stages of initial formation accumulation and maturation in mbr reactors which were dominated by different keystone species yuan et al 2021 coincidentally salinity adaptation particle size transition maturation and steady state periods were found during aerobic granular sludge formation because of the functional demands faced at different stages li et al 2020a these results imply the widespread existence of trade offs in different microbial communities and their functions in biofilm based bioreactors therefore this study provides a better understanding of the functional trade offs between species traits and diversity in artificially constructed bioreactor ecosystems and thus reveals new insights for the construction and stable operation of bioreactors moreover in addition to the functional trade offs based on bacteria communication the relationship between phylogenetic based microbial community assembly and function should be further considered in artificial bioreactors 5 conclusion in conclusion microbial community evolution and functional trade offs were investigated during biofilm development using an artificial gas biofilter the results showed that the biofilm community self regulated at different phases during the operation of the bioreactors based on the removal performance and biomass accumulation results the state of the biofilter experienced three phases start up stable operation and clogging the high throughput sequencing results and microbial functional analysis revealed that microbial colonization dominated the start up period and eps secretion and qs related bacteria were analyzed as biomarkers then the biofilm continued to grow and the target pollutant degrading bacteria became the dominant species to maintain the stable operation of the reactor finally excessive accumulation of biomass caused a clogging phenomenon and biofilms entered the aging stage because of limitations in living space the interspecific competition of microorganisms was amplified with species with high competitiveness occupying higher ecological niches during the clogging phase moreover bacterial communication and communication interruptions are active processes in community trade offs qs behavior promoted rapid colonization of the biofilm at start up and remained highly correlated with biofilm accumulation during the entire operation the qq behavior increased during the clogging phase and remained highly negatively correlated with the biofilm accumulation rate the results presented here provide theoretical support for the regulation of biofilms in bioreactors based on population communication interruption and reveal new insights into community evolution and

14926,biofilters inoculated with activated sludge are widely used for odor control in wwtp in this process biofilm community evolution plays an important role in the function of reactor and is closely related to reactor performance however the trade offs in biofilm community and bioreactor function during the operation are still unclear herein an artificially constructed biofilter for odorous gas treatment was operated for 105 days to study the trade offs in the biofilm community and function biofilm colonization was found to drive community evolution during the start up phase phase 1 days 0 25 although the removal efficiency of the biofilter was unsatisfactory at this phase the microbial genera related to quorum sensing and extracellular polymeric substance secretion led to the rapid accumulation of the biofilm 2 3 kg biomass m3 filter bed day during the stable operation phase phase 2 days 26 80 genera related to target pollutant degradation showed increases in relative abundance which accompanied a high removal efficiency and a stable accumulation of biofilm 1 1 kg biomass m3 filter bed day at the clogging phase phase 3 days 81 105 a sharp decline in the biofilm accumulation rate 0 5 kg biomass m3 filter bed day and fluctuating removal efficiency were observed the quorum quenching related genera and quenching genes of signal molecules increased and competition for resources among species drove the evolution of the community in this phase the results of this study highlight the trade offs in biofilm community and functions during the operation of bioreactors which could help improve bioreactor performance from a biofilm community perspective graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wwtp odors biofilter biofilm community evolution function trade offs quorum sensing data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction biofiltration is a cost effective technology that is widely used to treat gaseous odorants in wastewater treatment plants wwtps gabriel and deshusses 2003 tang and deshusses 2020 wang et al 2009 in biofilters odorants are converted by microorganisms into carbon and energy sources for microbial growth hu et al 2015 wang et al 2021 the biofilm community formed by microorganisms attached to the substrate surface affects the overall performance of the biofilter kong et al 2013a zhang et al 2018 therefore it could provide a better understanding of the development to function linkages in wwtp odorant biofiltration treatment processes through tracking biofilm community evolution during the entire operation period of biofilters the overall performance is affected by biofilm characteristics wang et al 2022a yang et al 2020 for example the microbial extracellular polymeric substance eps level increases with reactor operation and increased eps secretion facilitates biofilm adhesion and improves the biofilter start up performance wang et al 2009 wang et al 2022b however clogging caused by excessive eps secretion and biofilm accumulation reduces the operational stability wang et al 2009 wang et al 2022b moreover microbial community succession in biofilms leads to the formation of a heterogeneous and dynamic microscale ecosystem wang et al 2019 yuan et al 2021 the functions of different species in the community contribute to intricate interspecies interactions and closely affect the operation of biofilters deng et al 2012 he et al 2010 yuan et al 2021 at the microscale dominant species are constantly evolving and play different roles at different times because of the heterogeneity of living space and limited ecological niches brislawn et al 2019 leventhal et al 2018 morgenroth and milferstedt 2009 yuan et al 2021 reports have indicated that the functions of the biofilm community are locally dominated by a few species however the dominant species show substantial variation at the temporal scale leventhal et al 2018 schiettekatte et al 2022 zhou et al 2013 therefore it can be expected that no community can maximize all functions in biofilters and it is necessary to reveal the changing process of communities and functions in biofilters furthermore microbial communication such as interspecific cooperation and competition is also dynamically altered during the development of biofilters zhou et al 2013 however few studies have focused on the function of biofilm community interactions in gas biofilters due to its long term presence in the gas solid phase a community s composition may be affected by various factors such as adhesion between the biofilm and carrier and the impact of airflow wang et al 2009 yuan et al 2021 in addition the biofilm community might be also affected by the reduction in filter bed porosity and the living space of microorganisms during long term operation zhou et al 2013 however it is still poorly understood about the biofilm community structure and evolutionary factors at different phases in gas biofilters therefore a better understanding should be developed of the role of the microbial community in different phases and the evolution of species communication to maintain the operational stability of gas biofilters quorum sensing qs plays a role in bacteria to bacteria communication in biofilm based bioreactors whiteley et al 2017 yuan et al 2021 qs refers to the phenomenon in which bacteria self produce signal molecules and accumulate them to a level that regulates gene expression huws et al 2021 whalen et al 2019 previous studies have reported that qs drives the biofilm formation process and is closely related to bioreactor performance huang et al 2016 lee et al 2018 whalen et al 2019 it was reported that the activity of bacteria was significantly enhanced by the induction of exogenous signaling molecules tang et al 2018a sun et al 2022 quorum quenching qq a strategy to degrade signal molecules to inhibit qs behavior has also been found to be important for maintaining biofilm stability kim et al 2013 wang et al 2022a whiteley et al 2017 xu et al 2020a and it persists longer than qs activity in aerobic granules li et al 2020b whiteley et al 2017 therefore a dynamic evolution of qs and qq behavior could be expected in biofilm based biofilters however the effect of microbial communication evolution on biofilm communities and bioreactor operations is poorly understood moreover whether the performance of the bioreactor can have a reverse influence on microbial communication should be better understood specifically it poorly known that the effect of clogging caused by excessive accumulation of biofilm in gas biofilters on the balance between qs and qq activity therefore the link between microbial community communication evolution and bioreactor biofilm status cannot be ignored and deeper insights into qs and qq during start up and successive long term operation of bioreactors would be helpful for developing a qs based strategy to regulate performance in this study a laboratory scale gas biofilter was established to study the evolution of the microbial community structure during bioreactor operation to capture the changes and functions of the dominant flora at different developmental stages the biofilter was divided into three stages according to operating performance and biomass accumulation start up stable operation and clogging high throughput sequencing analysis and functional gene prediction were combined to comprehensively capture the characteristics and functions of the biofilm communities the relative abundance of qs and qq related bacteria was quantified by building a local database furthermore the association between qs and qq based bacterial communication in bioreactor pollutant removal and biomass accumulation was compared using a correlation analysis the results offer deeper insights into the trade offs in microbial community evolution and bioreactor operation revealing the critical role of the qs based bacterial communication system 2 materials and methods 2 1 biofilter operation one lab scale biofilter was established as acrylic cylinder with a total volume of 1 3 l inner diameter of 6 cm and 45 cm

used as inoculated sludge as described by wang et al wang et al 2022b the schematic diagram of biofiltration odor treatment process was shown in figure s1 nutrient solution was regularly sprayed for sufficient humidity and nutrients from the top into the biofilter its formula is shown in table s1 2 2 dna extraction and high throughput sequencing analysis biofilm samples from the substrate surface

vibration conditions using phosphate buffer solution 0 01 m ph 7 2 as the solution afterwards an e z n a stool dna kit d4015 omega inc usa was used to extract dna from the biofilm samples according to the manufacturer s instructions nuclear free water was used as a blank the v3 v4 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified using primers 341f 5 cctacgggnggcwgcag 3 and 805r 5 gactachvgggtatctaatcc 3 polymerase chain reaction pcr was conducted as previously described xu et al 2019 wang et al 2022c and the products were confirmed by 2 agarose gel electrophoresis afterwards the pcr products were purified and quantified using ampure xt beads beckman coulter genomics danvers ma usa and qubit invitrogen usa amplicons were then used for high throughput sequencing on the novaseq pe250 platform at lc bio technology co ltd hang zhou zhejiang province china operational taxonomic units otus were identified using the uparse function within usearch the raw reads obtained from the samples were deposited in the ncbi genbank accession number prjna851523 alpha diversity observed otus shannon diversity index and pielou s evenness index was calculated using qiime2 which randomly extracted the same number of sequences by reducing the number of sequences to the minimum of some samples and the relative abundance x bacteria count total count was used for the bacterial taxonomy differentially expressed genera in different samples were analyzed using the r package venndiagram version 1 6 20 the differences in microbial communities between the groups were calculated based on the bray curtis algorithm and an analysis of similarities anosim matrix was obtained function predictions were performed using bugbase while predictions of qs and qq related gene expression were performed with picrust2 the biomarkers in biofilm samples were identified through linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse analysis which was performed using a cloud platform https www omicstudio cn tool 60 the p value threshold of the wilcoxon test was set to 0 05 and the lda log score threshold was set to 4 0 2 3 establishment of a functional genera database to assess the evolution of qs and qq related genera a uniprotkb based local qs and qq database was established xu et al 2020b keywords such as quorum sensing autoinducer and accessory gene regulator were searched on uniprotkb and then the related genera were integrated to form a qs local database hong et al 2016 xu et al 2020b in addition a qq local database was formed by searching keywords such as quorum quenching acylase and lactonase on uniprotkb the community taxonomy obtained from high throughput sequencing was compared in a local database and qs and qq related genera were screened for subsequent analysis related qs function genes that have been previously reported were selected to explore the role of bacterial communication in the biofilm community tang et al 2018a specifically the relative abundance of the luxs cqsa luxi and rpff genes and luxr family genes in the microbial samples was analyzed using functional gene prediction to represent qs behavior miller and bassler 2001 tang et al 2018b waters and bassler 2005 whiteley et al 2017 moreover lactonase and acylase were selected to represent qq according to their enzymatic mechanisms dong and zhang 2005 for the degradation of the target pollutant gaseous toluene a local database of toluene degradation genera was constructed by searching the keywords monooxygenase and dioxygenase parales et al 2000 in uniprotkb qs qq and toluene degradation related genera in the database can be found in supplementary material excel s1 s3 the top 15 genera in terms of relative abundance in the different biofilm samples were considered core genera for further analysis huang et al 2021 2 4 analytical methods a gas chromatograph gc7900 tianmei china with a flame ionization detector and capillary column was used to quantify the inlet and outlet gaseous toluene concentrations the water displacement method was used to quantify the porosity ε of the filter bed han et al 2020 the biomass accumulation inside the biofilter was intermittently measured using an electronic scale kaifeng 968 kaifeng group co ltd china according to wang et al wang et al 2009 a piezometer jjg540 88 bolaite shanghai china was used to measure the pressure drop in the filter bed to evaluate the clogging status the ergun equation was used to fit the relationship between the filter bed pressure drop and flow rate parameter α was used to represent the clogging status wang et al 2022b the porosity ε and clogging status of the filter bed were used to evaluate the living space of the biofilm community the eps secreted from the microbes was analyzed using the heat extraction method the biofilm samples collected from the biofilter were washed three times using phosphate buffered saline pbs ph 7 0 and then pretreated by ultrasonication wang et al 2022a the lowry method and phenol sulfuric acid method were used to determine the proteins and polysaccharides bovine serum albumin solarbio co ltd beijing china and glucose yuanli chemical co ltd tianjin china were used as the standards each result was obtained from the average values of the three parallel samples ahl production was tested based on the chromogenic reaction between a tumefaciens a136 provided by seoul national university and ahls huang et al 2016 li et al 2020b 2 5 statistical analysis the analysis of variance anova using spss 19 0 was used for the statistic differences of eps secretion overall performance and genera relative abundance p 0 05 was considered to be significant differences the correlation fitting is done in origin 8 0 3 results 3 1 development of the gas biofilter in this study the removal efficiencies of gaseous toluene and pressure drop which were used to evaluate the overall performance during the operation were used to divide the biofilter development process table s2 during the first 25 days although the removal efficiencies climbed to 80 the pressure drop showed no obvious increasing trend meanwhile removal efficiency began to fluctuate down and pressure drop increased sharply after day 80 fig 1 therefore the biofilter development process was divided into three distinct phases start up phase 1 days 0 25 stable operation phase 2 days 26 80 and clogging phase 3 days 81 105 as shown in fig 1 the inlet concentration of gaseous toluene during the entire operation was 400 200 mg m3 whereas the outlet concentration showed differences in various phases in phase 1 the outlet concentration decreased with time and was below 50 mg m3 on day 25 in addition the removal efficiencies of gaseous toluene increased to above 80 indicating that the biofilter was successfully activated moreover the biomass accumulated from a 50 kg biomass m3 filter bed to a 110 kg biomass m3 filter bed at the end of phase 1 and the pressure drop of the filter bed was maintained below 20 pa m fig 1b these findings were consistent with that of previous studies showing that the successful start up of the bioreactor was accomplished by the accumulation of biomass and the process of microbial domestication wang et al 2009 yuan et al 2021 in phase 2 the removal efficiency remained above 80 and was stable until 80 days biomass accumulation also increased at the end of phase 2 and reached 160 kg biomass m3 filter bed meanwhile the accumulation rate decreased compared to that in phase 1 suggesting that the biofilm remained in a stable development stage after rapid accumulation in the start up stage in addition the pressure drop also showed a lower growth rate compared to that in phase 1 and increased to 58 pa m on day 80 in phase 3 days 81 105 the biomass did not show a rapid accumulation rate and the value was only 10 kg biomass m3 filter bed higher than that at the end of phase 2 fig 1b however the removal efficiency of the biofilter fluctuated and decreased to 60 on day 105 fig 1a and the pressure drop increased to 110 pa m this indicated that the continuous accumulation of biomass deteriorated the filter bed structure reduced the airflow channels and increased the pressure drop according to previous studies delhoménie et al 2003 dorado et al 2012 excessive accumulation of biomass leads to clogging of the filter bed which decreases the performance of the biofilter the eps content also showed a similar trend because both proteins and polysaccharides were significantly elevated at day 90 compared to that at days 25 and 45 p 0 05 figure s2 a dense biofilm structure forms because of excessive eps secretion which affects microbial interactions in the biofilm van loosdrecht et al 1987 xu et al 2020a the status of the filter was also confirmed by the porosity results and ergun equation as shown in figure s3a the initial porosity of the filter bed phase 1 was 0 45 and decreased to 0 34 in phase 3 suggesting that the space was occupied by the excessively accumulated biomass moreover the change in parameter α from the ergun equation from 0 29 in day 25 to 0 93 in day 90 reflects the decrease of airflow channel caused by the reduce of porosity figure s3b table s3 these results suggest that the space of the filter bed decreases with time which might lead to a change in the living environment of microorganisms because the bioreactor is also a micro ecosystem xu et al 2019 yuan et al 2021 3 2 bacterial community succession during the operation the observed otus differed throughout the operation compared to phase 1 day 25 496 otus the observed otus decreased in phase 2 day 45 401 otus figure s3 suggesting a potential selection of the biofilm community on the filter the venn diagram showed that 60 microbial genera existed independently on day 25 whereas this value decreased to 26 on day 45 indicating that a number of genera disappeared after the start up phase fig 2 b in addition the biodiversity of biofilms increased at day 45 and was accompanied by an improvement in pielou s evenness index fig 2c and e this phenomenon demonstrated the priority effect in microbiome assembly in which some pioneers enhance biofilm colonization but disappear during evolution debray et al 2022 yuan et al 2021 moreover local factors such as the continued influx of gaseous organics might drive the evolution of the community from phase 1 to phase 2 which leads to a high removal performance the evolution of the biofilm community during this phase is shown in fig 2 similar to that on day 45 27 microbial genera occurred independently on day 65 fig 2b illustrating that fewer changes in species occurred in phase 2 compared to phase 1 however both the biodiversity and pielou s evenness index of the biofilm community decreased in phase 2 fig 2c and e in this phase the operating performance of the bioreactor remained stable but the biomass increased and porosity decreased fig 1b from day 80 to day 105 phase 3 the small biomass growth indicates that the living space of the microbes in the biofilter had reached the threshold dorado et al 2012 han et al 2020 in this phase the biomass levels remained largely stable and did not grow because of the constant internal space of the biofilter which caused environmental stress living space in the biofilm community yawata et al 2014 interestingly independently occurring genera increased to 56 in phase 3 day 90 while biodiversity and pielou s evenness increased fig 2c and e these results indicating that the increased biodiversity and pielou s evenness might be helpful in response to the environmental stress in the biofilm ecosystems which was also reported in ecology yuan et al 2021 succession of the bacterial community was further observed based on an anosim analysis fig 2d the community in phase 1 had a greater matrix distance from that in phase 3 than it did from that in phase 2 moreover the distance between days 65 and 90 was lower than that between days 45 and 90 these results suggest that the succession of the microbial community was based on the previous stage and might have been affected by real time environmental factors morgenroth and milferstedt 2009 song et al 2022 tang et al 2018a differences in the relative abundance of core genera in the three phases validated the evolution of biofilm communities fig 2a genera associated with biofilm formation eps secretion and biofilm adhesion showed high relative abundance at phase 1 such as burkholderia dyella and mycobacterium figure s5 and s6 suggesting that biofilm colonization drives community construction chakraborty and kumar 2019 d angelo picard et al 2005 kong et al 2013b pallud et al 2001 however genera that present a great ability to degrade aromatic compounds dominated phase 2 such as rhodanobacter gordonia acidocella and sphingomonas bracher et al 2015 deng et al 2015 joyyi et al 2017 sowani et al 2019 interestingly the relative abundance of the genera that maintained biofilm stability and presented extremely competitive behavior increased in phase 3 for example tm7a cannot be cultured but can occur on the surface of host bacteria to obtain energy which inhibits the growth of the host bacteria bor et al 2019 he et al 2015 as a typical pathogen bacillus has a strong adhesion ability but prevents biofilm formation and adhesion of other microorganisms rönner et al 1990 zhang et al 2021 these results suggest that competition for resources might have dominated community evolution in phase 3 3 3 evolution of biomarkers in biofilm communities lefse analysis was used to identify the biomarker species of biofilm communities in different phases biomarkers between different phases during the operation were analyzed as shown in fig 3 and s7 a total of 39 bacterial clades presented statistically significant differences between phase 1 day 25 and phase 2 day 45 with an lda threshold of 4 0 whereas 26 bacterial clades were annotated at phase 2 day 45 figure s7a these findings suggest that biomarkers in the biofilm community had evolved and indicate that the degradation of pollutants and stable operation of the bioreactor were the main functions of the biofilm community in this phase interestingly numerous biomarkers were found between the biofilm community on days 45 and 65 figure s7b suggesting that the community continued to evolve despite a lack of changes in reactor performance this indicates that biomarker species might serve other potential functions in addition to maintaining reactor performance yue et al al 2019 the phylum and genus level biomarkers in the overall biofilm community were screened for a detailed analysis because of their clearer functional annotations tang et al 2018a xu et al 2019 six microbial phyla total relative abundance 95 were identified as biomarkers figure s8 during the succession of the overall biofilm community fig 3c proteobacteria the most widespread phylum in nature contains multiple functions such as pollutant degradation earth cycling and biofilm adhesion and colonization xu et al 2019 yawata et al 2014 zhang et al 2021 and was analyzed as a biomarker in phase 1 fig 3a and c however the biomarkers at the genus level burkholderia and pandoraea showed great potential for eps secretion and biofilm formation leventhal et al 2018 pallud et al 2001 and a high correlation with biomass accumulation rate and porosity fig 3e these results indicate that microbial colonization is a major function of the microbial community in phase 1 moreover the biomarkers at the genus level in phase 2 remained highly correlated with the removal efficiency fig 3c and e indicating that community construction might be dominated by pollutant degradation this finding was consistent with the degradation of aromatic compounds in these genera bracher et al 2015 deng et al 2015 joyyi et al 2017 sowani et al 2019 interestingly the biomarkers analyzed in phase 3 showed extremely low correlation with removal efficiency and biomass accumulation rate fig 3c and e but showed high relative abundance fig 3d stenotrophomonas chryseobacterium and acidisoma are highly resistant to harsh environments garcía et al 2015 khare et al 2020 in addition streptacidiphilus has shown great potential to degrade biopolymers hariharan 2018 these functions of phase 3 biomarkers might represent responses to clogging which limited the living space and forced an increase in genera associated with tolerance and ecosystem stability morgenroth and milferstedt 2009 song et al 2022 yuan et al 2021 in addition most biomarkers were related to qs and qq table s4 indicating that the role of qs based bacterial communication should not be ignored 3 4 evolution of function genera in microbial communities fig 4 shows the evolution of related functional bacterial genera in the microbial community in the biofilters including qs qq and toluene degradation related genera independently occurring qs related genera were analyzed using a venn diagram fig 4a and found to be abundant in phase 1 the high number of qs related genera in phase 1 might be helpful for biofilm colonization dong and zhang 2005 wang et al 2022b previous studies have reported that biofilm formation can be greatly promoted by administering exogenous ahls sun et al 2022 tang et al 2018a this could explain why a high level of ahls was produced in phase 1 fig 4b in phase 2 the relative abundance of toluene degradation related functional microbial genera increased from 14 phase 1 to 58 figure s9 the function of most of the genera such as rhodanobacter rhodobacter acidocella and actinobacteria were reported the function of toluene degradation potential and were core species in phase 2 these core species contributed to the efficient and stable operation of the biofilter therefore the function of the biofilm community shifted from colonization in phase 1 to degradation in phase 2 the qs related genera and qq related genera in phase 3 showed significant differences with increases in qq related genera but decreases in qs related genera fig 4c and d rhodanobacter acidocella rauoultella clostridium and novosphingobium represented typical qs genera and showed high relative abundance in phase 1 and phase 2 but decreased abundance in phase 3 fig 4e dyella gordonia alphaproteobacteria and sphingomonas all showed qq potential and had an increased relative abundance in phase 3 qq gene and protein information can be found in the supporting information fig 4f and figure s10 these results suggest that qq related genera might play a more important role after the long term operation of biofilters than qs related genera a more detailed analysis of the roles of the qq and qs related genera is presented in the next section 3 5 quorum sensing and quorum quenching as the active process in the studied biofilter to further explore the relationship between qs qq behavior and biofilter operation performance a correlation fitting is shown in fig 5 the removal efficiency was statistically analyzed according to the three phases fig 5a and then linearly fitted with the relative abundance of the genera associated with toluene degradation fig 5b a highly correlated fitting relationship r2 0 80 was observed between the two parameters this result suggests that the removal efficiency of the biofilter was highly affected by the pollutant degrading genera interestingly the relative abundance of qs genera also maintained a high correlation with reactor performance removal efficiency r2 0 58 previous studies have shown that increased qs activity in biofilms favors biomass accumulation and promotes the start up of bioreactors sun et al 2022 tang et al 2018a however the decrease in the removal efficiency of the biofilter in phase 3 was accompanied by a decrease in the relative abundance of qs genera indicating that qs might play a role in pollutant degradation afterwards the correlations between the relative abundances of qs genera and toluene degrading genera were fitted fig 5f these two parameters were also highly correlated r2 0 94 which has rarely been reported in previous studies these results suggest that the role of qs in pollutant degradation in bioreactors cannot be ignored signaling molecule synthesis and quenching genes play important roles in bacterial communication and interference which may affect biofilm formation in bioreactors wang et al 2019 xu et al 2020b fig 5e shows the relative abundance evolution of synthesis and quenching genes in biofilms details of the gene description are shown in table s5 and s6 the abundance of synthesis genes was significantly higher than that of quenching genes in phase 1 interestingly the abundance of synthesis genes decreased while the abundance of quenching genes increased with time and these two groups showed no significant differences in phase 3 fig 5e these results suggest that bacterial communication might dominate the construction of biofilm communities in phase 1 because it aids in the colonization and accumulation of biofilms however in phase 3 increased bacterial communication interference may play a major role qq is produced to aid in the competition or promote private benefits of producing cells whiteley et al 2017 therefore the enhanced qq behavior might be more favorable for competitive species survival at the clogging stage in phase 3 moreover a highly positive correlation r2 0 93 was found between the biomass accumulation rate and abundance of synthesis genes fig 5g the highest biomass accumulation rate occurred in phase 1 and decreased with time fig 5d thus confirming the synergistic effect between qs and biofilm formation additionally the biomass accumulation rate was negatively correlated r2 0 87 with the abundance of signaling molecule quenching genes fig 5h confirming the inhibiting effect of qq in biofilm accumulation 4 discussion biofilters are widely used to control odorant pollutants although numerous studies have focused on the performance of bioreactors the evolution and assembly of microbial communities are increasingly being recognized as important factors leventhal et al 2018 tang et al 2018a xu et al 2019 here the trade offs of microbial communities and function at different phases in biofilm based gas biofilters were revealed through 105 days of operation fig 6 4 1 biofilm community and function trade offs at different phase in biofilters although the operational performance in phase 1 was unsatisfactory biomass accumulation was found to be unusually active fig 1 this might be attributed to that the start up of the biofilter begins with the colonization of microorganisms the genera with functions that include eps secretion microbial adhesion and biofilm formation show a high relative abundance fig 2a compared to phase 1 the operational performance was improved in phase 2 but the species diversity declined which illustrates the widespread ecological effects in artificially constructed bioreactors that some pioneers drive colonization of microbial populations but forfeited the priority effect and disappeared during community evolution brislawn et al 2019 yuan et al 2021 in addition the functions of the dominant species have changed consistent with the operational performance the relative abundance of aromatic degrading genera improved rhodanobacter rhodobacter acidocella and actinobacteria which were reported the function of toluene degradation potential figure s9 environmental selection caused by the continuous influx of aromatic compounds gaseous toluene drives the evolution of community functions to maintain community stability and species survival huws et al 2021 leventhal et al 2018 interestingly the operational performance remained highly consistent in phase 2 although the microbial communities at 45 and 65 days still showed differences fig 2 as the biofilter acts as a small fixed ecosystem figure s11 the accumulation of high biomass leads to the degradation of the local environment such as decreased filter bed porosity and decreased airflow channels such changes will have a negative impact on the microbial community therefore the relative abundance of microbes that are resistant to harsh environments begins to increase in phase 3 the operational performance declined as the local environment deteriorated further moreover some genera such as tm7a and bacillus showed extremely competitive behavior and increased relative abundance he et al 2015 zhang et al 2021 in addition streptacidiphilus was reported to degrade biopolymers in biofilms to maintain their competitiveness hariharan 2018 and its relative abundance increased from 0 03 phase 2 to 3 17 phase 3 this finding indicates that with living space limitations pollutant removal is no longer the main function and competition for resources among species dominates the evolution of the community in phase 3 these phenomena have also been reported in membrane bioreactor mbr systems and granular sludge ecosystems tan et al 2014 moreover the clogging caused by excessive biomass accumulation is usually considered to be the main factor leading to a decrease in the performance of gas biofilters delhoménie et al 2003 han et al 2020 however the results of this study suggest that the reduced relative abundance of toluene degrading genera in biofilms might have affected the removal performance in phase 3 the effect of resource competition within the community is amplified when living space is limited debray et al 2022 whiteley et al 2017 some pathogenic bacteria showed a strong competitive potential and seized valuable ecological niches in phase 3 which might have reduced the number of degrading bacteria wang et al 2019 whalen et al 2019 4 2 role of bacteria communication quorum sensing and quorum quenching the evolution of bacteria to bacteria communication was also reflected in this study high ahl production was observed in phase 1 although it decreased with the accumulation of the biofilm qs has been reported to coordinate community assembly and enhance the biofilm formation process whiteley et al 2017 yue et al 2019 although qs related genera presented low relative abundances in phase 1 the high biomass accumulation rate high ahls production and high relative abundance of signaling molecule synthesis genes all demonstrated the important role of these genera figs 4 and 5 the addition of ahls has been reported to improve pollutant removal loading and reduce the start up cycle of anammox systems sun et al 2022 tang et al 2018a however negative effects on granule size by the ahl producing strain were observed li et al 2017 this indicates that the mechanism of action of qs in the ecosystem is not completely unified in this study the relative abundance of qs bacteria and signal molecule synthesis genes decreased whereas the relative abundance of qq bacteria and signal molecule quenching genes increased in phase 3 fig 5 studies have suggested that qq bacteria persist longer than qs bacteria in bioreactors li et al 2020b therefore these results suggest that in addition to the role of qs related genera the role of qq related genera in the evolution of biofilm communities cannot be ignored this study also found a highly positive correlation between signal molecule synthesis genes and the biomass accumulation rate and a highly negative correlation between signal molecule quenching genes and the biomass accumulation rate fig 5 these findings provide theoretical guidance for regulating biofilm formation by the addition of ahl or ahl quenchers 4 3 implications how communities coexist in microbial aggregates is a subject of ongoing research although many studies have focused on interactions between species such as cooperation competition and predation a large number of findings suggest that trade offs in species performance regarding different ecological functions is one of the most common phenomena kneitel and chase 2004 schiettekatte et al 2022 ecologists have found that coral reef fish communities exhibit trade offs in different ecological functions driven by different community structures as a result of global climate change schiettekatte et al 2022 medical scientists have found trade offs in qs between pseudomonas aeruginosa and other species that are more favorable for beneficial clinical consequences luján et al 2022 therefore because of the extensive use of biofilm based reactors for the treatment of environmental pollutants identifying the factors that affect the trade offs in biofilm communities and the associated results is worthy of further study the results of this study demonstrated that biofilm communities exhibit different functional trade offs in the three phases of biofilters because of the different performance requirements these trade offs evolved from the rapid colonization of biofilms phase 1 to the degradation of pollutants phase 2 and competition for resources phase 3 in addition the biofilm community underwent three stages of initial formation accumulation and maturation in mbr reactors which were dominated by different keystone species yuan et al 2021 coincidentally salinity adaptation particle size transition maturation and steady state periods were found during aerobic granular sludge formation because of the functional demands faced at different stages li et al 2020a these results imply the widespread existence of trade offs in different microbial communities and their functions in biofilm based bioreactors therefore this study provides a better understanding of the functional trade offs between species traits and diversity in artificially constructed bioreactor ecosystems and thus reveals new insights for the construction and stable operation of bioreactors moreover in addition to the functional trade offs based on bacteria communication the relationship between phylogenetic based microbial community assembly and function should be further considered in artificial bioreactors 5 conclusion in conclusion microbial community evolution and functional trade offs were investigated during biofilm development using an artificial gas biofilter the results showed that the biofilm community self regulated at different phases during the operation of the bioreactors based on the removal performance and biomass accumulation results the state of the biofilter experienced three phases start up stable operation and clogging the high throughput sequencing results and microbial functional analysis revealed that microbial colonization dominated the start up period and eps secretion and qs related bacteria were analyzed as biomarkers then the biofilm continued to grow and the target pollutant degrading bacteria became the dominant species to maintain the stable operation of the reactor finally excessive accumulation of biomass caused a clogging phenomenon and biofilms entered the aging stage because of limitations in living space the interspecific competition of microorganisms was amplified with species with high competitiveness occupying higher ecological niches during the clogging phase moreover bacterial communication and communication interruptions are active processes in community trade offs qs behavior promoted rapid colonization of the biofilm at start up and remained highly correlated with biofilm accumulation during the entire operation the qq behavior increased during the clogging phase and remained highly negatively correlated with the biofilm accumulation rate the results presented here provide theoretical support for the regulation of biofilms in bioreactors based on population communication interruption and reveal new insights into community evolution and functional trade offs in artificial bioreactors declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

14927,recycling nutrients nitrogen phosphorus and potassium from human urine can potentially offset more than 13 of global agricultural fertilizer demand biological nitrification is a promising method for converting volatile ammonia in high strength human urine into stable ammonium nitrate a typical fertilizer but it is usually terminated in the intermediate production of nitrite due to the inhibition of nitrite oxidizing bacteria by free nitrous acid fna this study aimed to develop a stable nitrification process in a unique two stage bioreactor by removing critical barriers associated with fna inhibition experimental results show that half of the ammonium in high strength urine was successfully converted into nitrate forming valuable ammonium nitrate with a nitrogen concentration greater than 1500 mg n l the ammonium nitrate solution could retain most phosphorus 75 3 and potassium 96 1 in human urine resulting in nearly full nutrient recovery once concentrated the liquid compound fertilizer of ammonium nitrate was generated based on an assessment of economic and environmental impacts at the urban scale urine diversion for nutrient recovery using a technical combination of nitrification and reverse osmosis could reduce total energy input by 43 greenhouse gas emission by 40 and cost by 33 compared to conventional wastewater management further research is needed to optimize the two stage nitrification method on a larger scale graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords urine nitrification two stage method fertilizer free nitrous acid data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction separating human urine from the rest of the wastewater at the source has considerable environmental benefits although human urine accounts for only 1 of municipal wastewater it contributes 80 90 of nitrogen and more than 50 of phosphorus and potassium mass loads wald 2022 separating human urine at the source considerably reduces the pollutant load in wastewater making it easier for the effluent of wastewater treatment plants to meet stringent standards of nitrogen and potassium aissa grouz et al 2015 shang et al 2016 notably it is estimated that recovering nutrients nitrogen phosphorus and potassium from human urine will offset more than 13 of agricultural fertilizer consumption amounting to 13 6 billion in annual savings wald 2022 however further research is needed to determine how to use urine as an agricultural fertilizer in rural areas urine is stored in vats and then quickly used on nearby farms but on an urban scale it is challenging to transport urine directly from residential buildings to distant agricultural lands udert and wächter 2012 the volatilization of ammonia the hydrolyzed product of urea in urine generates an odor nuisance the large urine volume 95 of urine is water increases transport costs wald 2022 and dissemination of antibiotics resistance genes and pathogens in urine poses a potential threat to the environment udert et al 2006 to date researchers have developed different approaches to stabilize the nitrogen component in urine to minimize nitrogen volatilization although some challenges remain chipako and randall 2020 karak and bhattacharyya 2011 maurer et al 2006 one approach is to inhibit urea hydrolysis by lowering or increasing the ph which can retain urea in a stable state the most crucial nitrogen fertilizer aguilar 2011 boncz et al 2016 randall et al 2016 however urea hydrolysis occurs too quickly in urine collection systems necessitating a strong acid or alkali in the restrooms udert et al 2003a several technologies e g ammonia stripping adsorption and ion exchange allow urea hydrolysis to proceed while stabilizing ammonia to other nitrogen components başakçilardan kabakci et al 2007 johnston and richards 2003 pradhan et al 2017 biological nitrification nh4 no2 no3 is a low cost method for converting ammonium to nitrate but it requires ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob converting nh4 to no2 and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob converting no2 to no3 while treating urine wastewater studies have shown that aob and nob respond differently to various operating factors such as dissolved oxygen do temperature ph etc li et al 2019b phanwilai et al 2020 poot et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 fna hno2 no2 h has inhibited nob significantly more than aob hu et al 2023 zheng et al 2023 for example 0 0175 mg hno2 n l could inhibit nob by 50 whereas up to 0 2 mg hno2 n l was required to inhibit aob by 50 hellinga et al 1999 vadivelu et al 2006 the insufficient alkalinity of urine wastewater allows aob to nitrify only approximately 50 of ammonium to nitrite with the ph dropping below 6 christiaens et al 2019 fumasoli et al 2015 udert and wächter 2012 this facilitates fna accumulation considerably inhibiting nob nitrification no2 no3 zheng et al 2017 zuo et al 2022 several methods have been used to prevent the accumulation of fna in urine nitrification for example maintaining ph at a neutral level by adding the base e g naoh can prevent nitrite formation by converting nearly all ammonia to nitrate but continual alkalinity input would entail high operational expenses oosterhuis and van loosdrecht 2009 de paepe et al 2021 showed that coupling a urine nitrification bioreactor with an electrochemical system can provide a convenient and innovative alternative to base addition enabling complete nitrification without using chemicals udert et al 2012 recently proposed an intermittent feeding strategy for urine instead of alkalinity addition to maintaining a restricted ph range 6 0 7 2 this approach allows for the oxidation of half of the ammonia to nitrate forming a nitrate solution nh4no3 a crucial fertilizer however strict ph control will likely destabilize the process since fna accumulates at a low ph particularly under dynamic influent conditions fumasoli et al 2016 these results indicate that maintaining nob activity compatible with aob activity in a coexisting system is a great challenge due to fna inhibition park et al 2010 this begs the question of whether ammonia and nitrite are individually oxidized in the two systems our recent study proposes generating nitrite in the first bioreactor using aob nitritation followed by chemical nitrite oxidation to nitrate in the second bioreactor zuo et al 2022 the disadvantage of this technique is the complex operation of the second chemical bioreactor which necessitates automatic control devices and pure oxygen injection these undoubtedly increase the operation difficulty and cost in this study we attempt to develop a method by substituting the chemical process in the second bioreactor with biological nitrification by nob i e to play the roles of aob and nob in two different bioreactors the inhibitory impact of nob is speculated to be lessened by lowering the nitrite feeding rate in the nob bioreactor achieving a balance between nitrite consumption in the nob bioreactor and nitrite generation in the aob bioreactor this study aimed to assess the technical feasibility of a two stage microbial process for partial nitrification of source separated urine a two stage nitrification method was established including two bioreactors fed with urine wastewater one for converting half of the ammonia to nitrite using aob and the other for converting nitrite to nitrate using nob there appears to be steady partial nitrification with the nitrogen component of the effluent as an ammonium nitrate solution following that the environmental and economic potential of the proposed method was evaluated this insight will provide a new technology alternative for recovering nutrient rich fertilizer from source separated urine 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiments on the production of ammonium nitrate from urine 2 1 1 bioreactor setup operation and monitoring the experimental laboratory system included two bioreactors the aob bioreactor and the nob bioreactor fig 1 the aob bioreactor was fed source separated urine to achieve partial nitritation i e half of the ammonium was converted to nitrite while the nob bioreactor was set to convert the generated nitrite to nitrate therefore ammonium nitrate was formed in the effluent of the nob bioreactor the detailed operating parameters of these two bioreactors are described below and summarized in table 1 the aob bioreactor was constructed with plexiglas cylinders with an adequate volume of 2 l 30 cm in height and 12 cm in inner diameter the bioreactor had a 12 h operational cycle that included feeding 0 2 h mixing and aeration 0 11 h settling 11 11 83 h or 50 min and decanting 11 83 12 h or 10 min the feed volume was 0 2 0 6 l in each operational cycle resulting in a hydraulic retention time hrt of 3 2 2 3 d the seed sludge was collected from a nitrification tank at the tsinghua water reuse plant in beijing china the source separated human urine collected from a male restroom at tsinghua university in beijing was fed into the aob bioreactor before feeding urine was stored in a container for over a week and subjected to urea hydrolysis to obtain a high concentration of ammonia ammonium 6 7 g n l with a ph of 9 3 0 1 the stored urine was then diluted with tap water in four stages to gradually increase the final ammonium concentration from 700 to 1500 mg n l 0 10 d 11 22 d 23 41 d and 42 150 d the influent ammonium loading rates in the four stages were 0 224 0 3 0 54 and 0 65 kg n m3 d respectively the operating temperature was maintained between 22 c and 25 c an air compressor hailea ac0 328 was used to aerate the aob bioreactor at a high airflow rate 2 3 l min resulting in a do concentration of about 2 mg o2 l during the aeration time the nob bioreactor had an adequate volume of 4 l and was fed with the influent at a constant flow rate of 2 5 ml min resulting in an influent volume of approximately 150 ml h the nob bioreactor discharged 150 ml of water per hour through membrane filtration preventing sludge loss within 5 min to maintain a consistent water level the hrt was approximately 1 1 d the aeration system became operational the operation was divided into four stages 0 26 d 27 39 d 40 83 d and 84 150 d to cultivate the nob the nob bioreactor was fed with synthetic water tap water containing nitrite in this experiment during phases i iii 0 83 d the initial nitrite concentration was 300 mg n l and it gradually increased during the operation resulting in an increase in the nitrite loading rate from 0 36 to 0 6 kg n m3 d at a constant flow rate of 2 5 ml min the ph of synthetic water was maintained to be 6 0 to match the ph of vitrified urine in the aob bioreactor on day 83 before feeding the aob bioreactor s vitrified urine into the nob bioreactor a preliminary test was conducted to assess the nob bioactivity at a relatively low ph close to the ph in nitrified urine of the aob bioreactor the detailed experimental procedure is provided in supplementary information si text s1 the nob bioreactor was fed with the aob bioreactor s effluent rather than synthetic water 84 150 d stage ii throughout the operation 0 150 d 5 ml effluent samples were collected 4 6 times per week from each of the two bioreactors for nitrogen component analysis including ammonium nitrite nitrate and ph except for sampling nearly no sludge was discharged during the operation which in theory produced less sludge liu et al 2022 another factor is that the urine system often functions at a low ph due to alkalinity limitations promoting in situ sludge reduction earlier research has also documented the operation of urine bioreactors without sludge output li et al 2019a zuo et al 2022 2 1 2 chemical analysis and calculation measurements of ammonium nitrite and nitrate in the water sample were performed following the standard methods ministry of environmental protection 2006 the do ph and temperature were monitored using a ph do meter wtw ph oxi340i the nitrite accumulation ratio nar in the bioreactor was calculated as follows 1 nar no 2 n no 2 n no 3 n 100 free ammonia fa and fna concentrations were calculated based on a thermodynamic model with consideration of the equilibriums of weak acid base and complex formation reactions text s2 table s1 based on the study of fumasoli et al 2016 chemical equilibria were modeled with back and forward reactions udert et al 2003b the computer model was implemented in the simulation environment aquasim 2 0 reichert 1994 2 2 environmental and economic assessment 2 2 1 scenario description implementing decentralized fertilizer recovery from human urine at the city scale still necessitates a system level evaluation to determine the practical feasibility of the proposed method for fertilizer recovery from urine and the economic and environmental impacts including greenhouse gas ghg emission and energy inputs were estimated two scenarios were designed and compared as shown in fig 2 scenario a is the baseline scenario in which the restrooms in all residence buildings are conventional and deliver mixed sewage to a centralized wastewater treatment plant wwtp the fertilizers are removed via traditional activated sludge processes in the wwtp the wwtp is assumed to collect wastewater from ten residential buildings each with a population of approximately 1000 persons assuming that each individual produces approximately 150 l of domestic wastewater per day the total influent volume loading of the wwtp is approximately 1500 m3 in scenario b the restrooms in residential buildings are urine diverting toilets which can considerably reduce the consumption of tap water used for urine flushing considering a three fold urine dilution ratio each person can contribute 4 5 l of diluted urine daily with a nitrogen concentration of approximately 2000 mg n l near the experimental influent ammonium concentration thus it is estimated that each building produces a total of 4 5 m3 of urine wastewater daily the on site urine treatment units are located in the basement of each building including a urine collection tank a bioreactor tank and a concentration tank fresh urine is hydrolyzed in the collection tank within one week and urea is rapidly converted to ammonia causing the ph to increase from approximately 6 to 9 mobley and hausinger 1989 using the two stage nitrification method established in this work ammonia in the urine was converted to ammonium nitrate in the bioreactor tank according to our experimental results the hrt in the reactor tank can be designed to convert ammonia to nitrite in an aob bioreactor 2 5 d and then further convert nitrite to nitrate in a nob bioreactor 1 5 d furthermore the ammonium nitrate solution will be concentrated in a subsequent concentration tank to remove 80 of the water using reverse osmosis technology as stated in the study of ek et al 2006 finally high concentration liquid ammonium nitrate is produced according to the design of these two scenarios the volume of the collection tank bioreactor tank and concentration tank in each building can be designed to be 32 m3 18 m3 and 10 m3 all alternatives produced an equal mass of nitrogen in the fertilizer 2 2 2 process parameters in both scenarios tap water is used for flushing urine although there is a substantial difference in flush water volume between conventional restrooms scenario a and urine diverting restrooms scenario b 0 5 l vs 6 l per flush ishii and boyer 2015 the original inputs used to generate tap water at drinking water treatment plants must be considered when groundwater is used as a water source the unit energy and ghg emissions for producing tap water are approximately 27 mj m3 and 1 628 kg co2 equiv m3 respectively stokes and horvath 2009 tap water was estimated to cost 0 9 m3 conventional and urine diverting restrooms are estimated to cost 200 and 700 respectively per toilet ishii and boyer 2015 the environmental impacts of manufacturing and installing conventional and urine diverting restrooms are considered equivalent disregarding the environmental impacts of these two types of equipment the infrastructure inputs of the urine treatment unit collection tank bioreactor tank and concentration tank included pipe steel concrete and excavation electricity was used for mixing aeration and pumping the infrastructure input data were obtained from cashman et al 2014 the energy input ghg emission and cost were calculated using data from our previous studies zheng et al 2017 and the electricity consumption data for the operation of the urine bioreactor tank and concentration tank were obtained from zheng et al 2017 and ek et al 2006 respectively under aeration conditions the conversion ratio of nitrogen of nitrous oxide to nitrogen of consumed ammonia was assumed to be 1 7 as evaluated in a full scale nitritation bioreactor kampschreur et al 2008 the capital cost of the tanks was estimated using a unit price per volume of approximately 60 m3 hao and hao 2009 life cycle inventory data for chemicals electricity and construction materials were obtained from the gabi database the price of electricity was set at 0 12 kwh from the literature law et al 2015 the gabi database was used to obtain the life cycle inventory energy and ghg emissions of ammonium nitrate the price of ammonium nitrate which contains 15 nitrogen was assumed to be 220 ton alibaba website in addition the environmental and economic benefits of urine source separation for the downstream wwtp were addressed the primary difference between scenarios a and b in the wwtp is the need for electricity for aeration pumping and mixing according to a recent report by badeti et al 2021 urine diversion can lower the overall wwtp energy consumption from approximately 0 58 to 0 45 kwh m3 total ghg emission from 1 95 to 1 4 kg co2 equiv m3 and total cost from 0 41 to 0 34 m3 3 results 3 1 production of ammonium nitrate from urine by a two stage nitrification method the feasibility of the established two stage nitrification method for producing ammonium nitrate from high strength human urine was evaluated through long term experiments in aob and nob bioreactors the following experimental results provide evidence in favor of the technical feasibility of this method 3 1 1 stable partial nitritation in an aob bioreactor as shown in fig 3 partial nitritation of the aob bioreactor tended to be stable with the nar approaching 100 as ammonium nitrogen in the aob bioreactor influent increased from 700 mg n l to 1500 mg n l within approximately 40 d during the subsequent 41 100 d the average ammonium and nitrite concentrations in the effluent stabilized at 600 70 and 515 50 mg n l respectively whereas nitrate was undetectable meanwhile the ph of the effluent gradually decreased and stabilized at 6 0 0 1 due to alkalinity consumption in the urine caused by proton production in the nitritation processes at such a low ph fna accumulated to a very high level about 1 0 mg hno2 n l and considerably inhibited nob as reported in previous literatures zheng et al 2017 zuo et al 2022 as the ammonium concentration in the influent of the aob bioreactor further increased from 1200 to 1500 mg n l on day 101 the effluent ammonium concentration gradually increased and was maintained at 800 100 mg n l during the subsequent operation 81 150 d while the nitrite concentration in the effluent almost remained unchanged 560 80 mg n l meanwhile the ph of the aob bioreactor effluent increased dramatically to 7 5 0 8 these differences indicated that aob activity was partially inhibited failing to convert half of the ammonium to nitrite and increasing ph because of the elevated ammonium concentration in the influent of the aob bioreactor the high strength fa was primarily responsible for suppressing the aob activity a similar fa inhibitory effect was observed in a previous study zuo et al 2022 if the ammonia concentration in urine increases the continuous stirred tank bioreactor cstr operation can be employed to prevent fa inhibition on aob as previously demonstrated in the literature fumasoli et al 2016 notably ammonium and nitrite concentrations decreased after day 120 without a nitrogen balance between the influent and the effluent fig s1 this could be because increasing the ph of the bioreactor produces more ammonia nitrogen which tends to volatilize under aerobic conditions additional factors must be identified in future studies 3 1 2 ammonium nitrate production in a nob bioreactor nob were cultured with synthetic water for 83 d before the vitrified urine of the aob bioreactor was fed into the nob bioreactor the initial nitrite concentration in the synthetic water was approximately 300 mg n l during the cultivation increasing to 325 mg n l on day 23 and 600 mg n l on day 45 fig 4 a the ph of the synthetic water was maintained at 6 0 to match the ph of the vitrified urine in the aob bioreactor this gradual increase in nitrogen input was expected to result in nob enrichment as shown in fig 4b the nitrate concentration in the nob bioreactor effluent began to fluctuate during day 60 and gradually stabilized at 600 mg n l after day 60 however the ph increased to approximately 9 0 a thermodynamic model with consideration of the equilibriums of weak acid base and complex formation reactions text s2 could explain that the ph increase is primarily related to the gas exchange of carbon dioxide due to bubble aeration text s3 fig s2 before connecting the aob and nob bioreactors a preliminary batch experiment was performed to test if nob remained active at a low ph a detailed experimental method is provided in text s1 when the initial nitrite concentration was approximately 5 mg n l the nob activity at ph 5 82 0 16 was close to neutral ph 7 8 indicating that nob were not inhibited at a low ph fig s3 this finding demonstrates the ability of nob to treat the aob bioreactor s low ph vitrified urine as a result on day 84 we used vitrified urine from an aob bioreactor instead of synthetic water as the influent of the nob bioreactor the water quality of aob vitrified urine is described above in section 3 1 1 fig 4b shows that using vitrified urine as the influent resulted in a quick increase in ammonium of the nob bioreactor effluent which remained at 776 140 mg n l after 90 d at an average nitrate output of 643 123 mg n l the nitrite was still entirely converted to nitrate nar 0 as a result the ammonium to nitrate ratio in the effluent nitrogen component is almost 1 1 notably after injecting vitrified urine of aob on day 84 the ph in the effluent began to fall and remained stable at 6 0 for 100 150 d the leading cause of the ph drop is that the aeration process does not influence the equilibrium of ionic distribution due to the very low alkalinity in the influent consumed in the aob bioreactor a high strength ammonium nitrate solution was generated via the proposed two stage nitrification method providing the necessary prerequisites for subsequent concentrations using established technology 3 1 3 recovery of additional nutrient components from urine in addition to nitrogen phosphorus and potassium are important nutrient components in fertilizers but their sources are unsustainable due to fossil energy or extraction from limited ore reserves larsen et al 2013 because urine includes half of the phosphorus and potassium in domestic wastewater recovering them from human urine is a possible alternative previous techniques have primarily focused on the recovery of different nutrients separately e g one well established method of recovering phosphorus from urine is to combine it with magnesium to form struvite fertilizer etter et al 2011 liu et al 2013 tilley et al 2008 we demonstrated that the developed two stage nitrification method could recover nitrogen phosphorus and potassium from urine many times in addition to nitrogen chemical analysis revealed that most phosphorus 75 3 and potassium 96 1 in urine were retained in the ammonium nitrate solution the phosphorus was not completely recovered probably due to the possibility of precipitation 3 2 energy input ghg emission and cost estimation the experimental results above demonstrated the technical feasibility of the developed two stage microbial nitrification method for producing fertilizer from urine two scenarios were examined to further evaluate the practical feasibility of the developed two stage nitrification method at a large urban scale scenario a was a conventional wastewater treatment method and agricultural synthetic fertilizer was used in scenario b a urine diverting restroom was used and the separated urine was treated to produce ammonium nitrate the annual ammonium nitrate production was estimated to be 24 6 tons n equivalent to 468 6 tons of ammonium nitrate n content is approximately 15 the energy inputs ghg emission and expenses of these two scenarios are compared in supplementary information table s1 the results are summarized in fig 5 urine diversion for fertilizer production using the developed two stage nitrification method i e scenario b effectively reduced the total energy input by 43 ghg emission by 40 and cost by 33 compared to the conventional system scenario a these were comparable to the overall performance e g 26 41 energy input reduction 29 47 ghg emission reduction of other urine treatment technologies such as urine concentration alternative or struvite precipitation hilton et al 2021 the energy input in scenario a was primarily provided by three components urine flush water wwtp operation and synthetic fertilizer with urine flush water accounting for half of the overall energy input for flushing urine 13 1 m3 of freshwater water was required per person per year and freshwater production was considered an important source of energy input synthetic fertilizer had the next largest impact on the energy input in scenario b the urine diverting restroom greatly reduced flushing water use 1 1 m3 per person per year resulting in an energy input reduction of 300 mj per person per year the proposed two stage nitrification method only increased energy input by a small amount 100 mj per person per year however the subsequent ammonium nitrate concentration process needed more energy 200 mj per person per year to remove 80 of the water from ammonium nitrate solution in this technique reverse osmosis was designed as a urine concentration process since it was proved to completely recover nitrogen from acidified urine e g at ph 6 0 with a low energy input 30 w h l 1 regarding ghg emissions the operation of wwtps was responsible for the largest impacts in both scenarios according to badeti et al 2021 direct emissions from nitrification denitrification and oxidation processes to remove chemical oxygen demand were reduced but indirect emissions from energy consumption were only slightly reduced in scenario a synthetic fertilizer production would generate 20 5 kg co2e per person per year in scenario b the expenses of constructing a urine diverting restroom and three tanks and their operation were estimated to increase by 12 6 per person per year yet saving flush water in urine diverting restrooms reduced freshwater production costs by 16 3 per person per year urine diversion reduced the influent nutrient load lowering the wwtp s operating costs by 3 3 per person per year notably the production of ammonium nitrate fertilizer from urine could offset synthetic fertilizer production worth 10 3 per person each year the developed two stage nitrification method like previous urine treatment methods has the potential to reduce most environmental impacts e g energy usage and ghg emission while also lowering per capita costs our analysis did not consider other positive impacts resulting from the simultaneous recovery of phosphorus and potassium in the ammonium nitrate solution therefore the expected environmental and economic benefits may be significant 4 discussion 4 1 technical advantages of the two stage nitrification method this study accomplished stable urine nitrification using a novel two stage nitrification method in which half of the ammonium was converted to nitrite by aob in the first bioreactor and then to nitrate by nob in the second bioreactor figs 3 and 4 several studies have demonstrated that fna inactivates nob more effectively than aob and relatively high concentrations of fna completely inhibit aob activity several efforts have been undertaken to prevent fna inhibition on nob in a coexisting system duan et al 2020 jiang et al 2018 wang et al 2014 intermittent urine feeding to keep the ph value within a restricted range 6 0 7 2 is one solution but the process destabilization remains the current challenge this challenge was addressed in this study by a new alternative in which aob and nob exist in two independent systems so that their activities do not interfere another advantage of this two stage nitrification method is that high level fna accumulation in the aob bioreactor may help simultaneously eliminate antibiotics antibiotic resistance genes and pathogens from urine this is due to fna induced cell lysis and the breakdown of macromolecular substances liu et al 2022 for example sulfamethoxazole could be effectively eliminated by 95 5 with the accumulation of fna during urine nitritation cheng et al 2021 some researchers found that fna pretreatment of activated sludge improved pathogen reduction by 2 1 0 2 logs in anaerobic digestion indicating that fna positively impacted pathogen removal wei et al 2018 however more research into the urine system is required these impacts could expand the advantages of the proposed method for recycling urine as a cleaner agricultural fertilizer 4 2 challenges and further research although long term experimental results demonstrated that aob and nob activities could play typical roles in respective bioreactors process instability must still be addressed the key problem affecting the aob bioreactor s process stability is the inhibition of aob by fa when the feed conditions e g urine dilution ratio are dynamic and difficult to control as shown in the data after day 81 in fig 3b this can be rectified by switching the bioreactor s operational mode to cstr the factor impacting process stability in the nob bioreactor running continuously at ph 6 0 is nob inhibition by fna when the feeding i e aob bioreactor effluent containing high strength nitrite is fast another potential issue is the growth of acid tolerant aob fumasoli et al 2016 certain acid tolerant strains e g nitrosococcus have been observed to reduce ph to as low as 2 2 fumasoli et al 2017 such extremely low ph levels could jeopardize process stability while releasing large volumes of harmful gasses such as nitric oxide nitrogen dioxide and nitrous oxide udert et al 2005 fumasoli et al 2017 zuo et al 2022 although our experiment did not have an extremely low ph further studies are required previously considerable work has been done to improve process stability through process control such as a combination of cascade and feed forward constrained control jamilis et al 2020 electrochemical nitrite sensing control thürlimann et al 2019 britschgi et al 2020 or mathematical model control volcke et al 2007 these control methods should make the nob bioreactor more stable controlling biomass retention time is another consideration in this study biomass was nearly never released which helps to reduce sludge treatment however this mode is unusual in practice many studies have shown that biomass retention time is a crucial factor affecting process stability and selecting an appropriate biomass retention time facilitates eliminating microorganisms that adversely affect the stable functioning of bioreactors dang et al 2022 lin et al 2023 nguyen et al 2021 this deserves further investigation in the proposed systems future studies should concentrate on higher tan strength and dynamic feeding conditions the tan concentration of urine in our experiment was less than 1500 mg n l which is still lower than certain separated urine concentrations furthermore practical urine feeding typically fluctuates dynamically which severely impacts the stability of the nitrification process 5 conclusions in summary based on experimental environmental and economic impact assessments this study proposed and examined a two stage nitrification method using aob and nob in two independent bioreactors the key findings are as follows 1 this two stage nitrification method could consistently convert half of the ammonium in high strength urine into nitrate resulting in a standard ammonium nitrate solution 2 urine diversion for liquid fertilizer production using a two stage nitrification method with ro dewatering might reduce total energy input by 43 ghg emission by 40 and cost by 33 compared to conventional wastewater treatment without urine diversion 3 in future investigations the operating conditions of the proposed two stage nitrification method can be further adjusted to improve process stability declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

14927,recycling nutrients nitrogen phosphorus and potassium from human urine can potentially offset more than 13 of global agricultural fertilizer demand biological nitrification is a promising method for converting volatile ammonia in high strength human urine into stable ammonium nitrate a typical fertilizer but it is usually terminated in the intermediate production of nitrite due to the inhibition of nitrite oxidizing bacteria by free nitrous acid fna this study aimed to develop a stable nitrification process in a unique two stage bioreactor by removing critical barriers associated with fna inhibition experimental results show that half of the ammonium in high strength urine was successfully converted into nitrate forming valuable ammonium nitrate with a nitrogen concentration greater than 1500 mg n l the ammonium nitrate solution could retain most phosphorus 75 3 and potassium 96 1 in human urine resulting in nearly full nutrient recovery once concentrated the liquid compound fertilizer of ammonium nitrate was generated based on an assessment of economic and environmental impacts at the urban scale urine diversion for nutrient recovery using a technical combination of nitrification and reverse osmosis could reduce total energy input by 43 greenhouse gas emission by 40 and cost by 33 compared to conventional wastewater management further research is needed to optimize the two stage nitrification method on a larger scale graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords urine nitrification two stage method fertilizer free nitrous acid data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction separating human urine from the rest of the wastewater at the source has considerable environmental benefits although human urine accounts for only 1 of municipal wastewater it contributes 80 90 of nitrogen and more than 50 of phosphorus and potassium mass loads wald 2022 separating human urine at the source considerably reduces the pollutant load in wastewater making it easier for the effluent of wastewater treatment plants to meet stringent standards of nitrogen and potassium aissa grouz et al 2015 shang et al 2016 notably it is estimated that recovering nutrients nitrogen phosphorus and potassium from human urine will offset more than 13 of agricultural fertilizer consumption amounting to 13 6 billion in annual savings wald 2022 however further research is needed to determine how to use urine as an agricultural fertilizer in rural areas urine is stored in vats and then quickly used on nearby farms but on an urban scale it is challenging to transport urine directly from residential buildings to distant agricultural lands udert and wächter 2012 the volatilization of ammonia the hydrolyzed product of urea in urine generates an odor nuisance the large urine volume 95 of urine is water increases transport costs wald 2022 and dissemination of antibiotics resistance genes and pathogens in urine poses a potential threat to the environment udert et al 2006 to date researchers have developed different approaches to stabilize the nitrogen component in urine to minimize nitrogen volatilization although some challenges remain chipako and randall 2020 karak and bhattacharyya 2011 maurer et al 2006 one approach is to inhibit urea hydrolysis by lowering or increasing the ph which can retain urea in a stable state the most crucial nitrogen fertilizer aguilar 2011 boncz et al 2016 randall et al 2016 however urea hydrolysis occurs too quickly in urine collection systems necessitating a strong acid or alkali in the restrooms udert et al 2003a several technologies e g ammonia stripping adsorption and ion exchange allow urea hydrolysis to proceed while stabilizing ammonia to other nitrogen components başakçilardan kabakci et al 2007 johnston and richards 2003 pradhan et al 2017 biological nitrification nh4 no2 no3 is a low cost method for converting ammonium to nitrate but it requires ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob converting nh4 to no2 and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob converting no2 to no3 while treating urine wastewater studies have shown that aob and nob respond differently to various operating factors such as dissolved oxygen do temperature ph etc li et al 2019b phanwilai et al 2020 poot et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 fna hno2 no2 h has inhibited nob significantly more than aob hu et al 2023 zheng et al 2023 for example 0 0175 mg hno2 n l could inhibit nob by 50 whereas up to 0 2 mg hno2 n l was required to inhibit aob by 50 hellinga et al 1999 vadivelu et al 2006 the insufficient alkalinity of urine wastewater allows aob to nitrify only approximately 50 of ammonium to nitrite with the ph dropping below 6 christiaens et al 2019 fumasoli et al 2015 udert and wächter 2012 this facilitates fna accumulation considerably inhibiting nob nitrification no2 no3 zheng et al 2017 zuo et al 2022 several methods have been used to prevent the accumulation of fna in urine nitrification for example maintaining ph at a neutral level by adding the base e g naoh can prevent nitrite formation by converting nearly all ammonia to nitrate but continual alkalinity input would entail high operational expenses oosterhuis and van loosdrecht 2009 de paepe et al 2021 showed that coupling a urine nitrification bioreactor with an electrochemical system can provide a convenient and innovative alternative to base addition enabling complete nitrification without using chemicals udert et al 2012 recently proposed an intermittent feeding strategy for urine instead of alkalinity addition to maintaining a restricted ph range 6 0 7 2 this approach allows for the oxidation of half of the ammonia to nitrate forming a nitrate solution nh4no3 a crucial fertilizer however strict ph control will likely destabilize the process since fna accumulates at a low ph particularly under dynamic influent conditions fumasoli et al 2016 these results indicate that maintaining nob activity compatible with aob activity in a coexisting system is a great challenge due to fna inhibition park et al 2010 this begs the question of whether ammonia and nitrite are individually oxidized in the two systems our recent study proposes generating nitrite in the first bioreactor using aob nitritation followed by chemical nitrite oxidation to nitrate in the second bioreactor zuo et al 2022 the disadvantage of this technique is the complex operation of the second chemical bioreactor which necessitates automatic control devices and pure oxygen injection these undoubtedly increase the operation difficulty and cost in this study we attempt to develop a method by substituting the chemical process in the second bioreactor with biological nitrification by nob i e to play the roles of aob and nob in two different bioreactors the inhibitory impact of nob is speculated to be lessened by lowering the nitrite feeding rate in the nob bioreactor achieving a balance between nitrite consumption in the nob bioreactor and nitrite generation in the aob bioreactor this study aimed to assess the technical feasibility of a two stage microbial process for partial nitrification of source separated urine a two stage nitrification method was established including two bioreactors fed with urine wastewater one for converting half of the ammonia to nitrite using aob and the other for converting nitrite to nitrate using nob there appears to be steady partial nitrification with the nitrogen component of the effluent as an ammonium nitrate solution following that the environmental and economic potential of the proposed method was evaluated this insight will provide a new technology alternative for recovering nutrient rich fertilizer from source separated urine 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiments on the production of ammonium nitrate from urine 2 1 1 bioreactor setup operation and monitoring the experimental laboratory system included two bioreactors the aob bioreactor and the nob bioreactor fig 1 the aob bioreactor was fed source separated urine to achieve partial nitritation i e half of the ammonium was converted to nitrite while the nob bioreactor was set to convert the generated nitrite to nitrate therefore ammonium nitrate was formed in the effluent of the nob bioreactor the detailed operating parameters of these two bioreactors are described below and summarized in table 1 the aob bioreactor was constructed with plexiglas cylinders with an adequate volume of 2 l 30 cm in height and 12 cm in inner diameter the bioreactor had a 12 h operational cycle that included feeding 0 2 h mixing and aeration 0 11 h settling 11 11 83 h or 50 min and decanting 11 83 12 h or 10 min the feed volume was 0 2 0 6 l in each operational cycle resulting in a hydraulic retention time hrt of 3 2 2 3 d the seed sludge was collected from a nitrification tank at the tsinghua water reuse plant in beijing china the source separated human urine collected from a male restroom at tsinghua university in beijing was fed into the aob bioreactor before feeding urine was stored in a container for over a week and subjected to urea hydrolysis to obtain a high concentration of ammonia ammonium 6 7 g n l with a ph of 9 3 0 1 the stored urine was then diluted with tap water in four stages to gradually increase the final ammonium concentration from 700 to 1500 mg n l 0 10 d 11 22 d 23 41 d and 42 150 d the influent ammonium loading rates in the four stages were 0 224 0 3 0 54 and 0 65 kg n m3 d respectively the operating temperature was maintained between 22 c and 25 c an air compressor hailea ac0 328 was used to aerate the aob bioreactor at a high airflow rate 2 3 l min resulting in a do concentration of about 2 mg o2 l during the aeration time the nob bioreactor had an adequate volume of 4 l and was fed with the influent at a constant flow rate of 2 5 ml min resulting in an influent volume of approximately 150 ml h the nob bioreactor discharged 150 ml of water per hour through membrane filtration preventing sludge loss within 5 min to maintain a consistent water level the hrt was approximately 1 1 d the aeration system became operational the operation was divided into four stages 0 26 d 27 39 d 40 83 d and 84 150 d to cultivate the nob the nob bioreactor was fed with synthetic water tap water containing nitrite in this experiment during phases i iii 0 83 d the initial nitrite concentration was 300 mg n l and it gradually increased during the operation resulting in an increase in the nitrite loading rate from 0 36 to 0 6 kg n m3 d at a constant flow rate of 2 5 ml min the ph of synthetic water was maintained to be 6 0 to match the ph of vitrified urine in the aob bioreactor on day 83 before feeding the aob bioreactor s vitrified urine into the nob bioreactor a preliminary test was conducted to assess the nob bioactivity at a relatively low ph close to the ph in nitrified urine of the aob bioreactor the detailed experimental procedure is provided in supplementary information si text s1 the nob bioreactor was fed with the aob bioreactor s effluent rather than synthetic water 84 150 d stage ii throughout the operation 0 150 d 5 ml effluent samples were collected 4 6 times per week from each of the two bioreactors for nitrogen component analysis including ammonium nitrite nitrate and ph except for sampling nearly no sludge was discharged during the operation which in theory produced less sludge liu et al 2022 another factor is that the urine system often functions at a low ph due to alkalinity limitations promoting in situ sludge reduction earlier research has also documented the operation of urine bioreactors without sludge output li et al 2019a zuo et al 2022 2 1 2 chemical analysis and calculation measurements of ammonium nitrite and nitrate in the water sample were performed following the standard methods ministry of environmental protection 2006 the do ph and temperature were monitored using a ph do meter wtw ph oxi340i the nitrite accumulation ratio nar in the bioreactor was calculated as follows 1 nar no 2 n no 2 n no 3 n 100 free ammonia fa and fna concentrations were calculated based on a thermodynamic model with consideration of the equilibriums of weak acid base and complex formation reactions text s2 table s1 based on the study of fumasoli et al 2016 chemical equilibria were modeled with back and forward reactions udert et al 2003b the computer model was implemented in the simulation environment aquasim 2 0 reichert 1994 2 2 environmental and economic assessment 2 2 1 scenario description implementing decentralized fertilizer recovery from human urine at the city scale still necessitates a system level evaluation to determine the practical feasibility of the proposed method for fertilizer recovery from urine and the economic and environmental impacts including greenhouse gas ghg emission and energy inputs were estimated two scenarios were designed and compared as shown in fig 2 scenario a is the baseline scenario in which the restrooms in all residence buildings are conventional and deliver mixed sewage to a centralized wastewater treatment plant wwtp the fertilizers are removed via traditional activated sludge processes in the wwtp the wwtp is assumed to collect wastewater from ten residential buildings each with a population of approximately 1000 persons assuming that each individual produces approximately 150 l of domestic wastewater per day the total influent volume loading of the wwtp is approximately 1500 m3 in scenario b the restrooms in residential buildings are urine diverting toilets which can considerably reduce the consumption of tap water used for urine flushing considering a three fold urine dilution ratio each person can contribute 4 5 l of diluted urine daily with a nitrogen concentration of approximately 2000 mg n l near the experimental influent ammonium concentration thus it is estimated that each building produces a total of 4 5 m3 of urine wastewater daily the on site urine treatment units are located in the basement of each building including a urine collection tank a bioreactor tank and a concentration tank fresh urine is hydrolyzed in the collection tank within one week and urea is rapidly converted to ammonia causing the ph to increase from approximately 6 to 9 mobley and hausinger 1989 using the two stage nitrification method established in this work ammonia in the urine was converted to ammonium nitrate in the bioreactor tank according to our experimental results the hrt in the reactor tank can be designed to convert ammonia to nitrite in an aob bioreactor 2 5 d and then further convert nitrite to nitrate in a nob bioreactor 1 5 d furthermore the ammonium nitrate solution will be concentrated in a subsequent concentration tank to remove 80 of the water using reverse osmosis technology as stated in the study of ek et al 2006 finally high concentration liquid ammonium nitrate is produced according to the design of these two scenarios the volume of the collection tank bioreactor tank and concentration tank in each building can be designed to be 32 m3 18 m3 and 10 m3 all alternatives produced an equal mass of nitrogen in the fertilizer 2 2 2 process parameters in both scenarios tap water is used for flushing urine although there is a substantial difference in flush water volume between conventional restrooms scenario a and urine diverting restrooms scenario b 0 5 l vs 6 l per flush ishii and boyer 2015 the original inputs used to generate tap water at drinking water treatment plants must be considered when groundwater is used as a water source the unit energy and ghg emissions for producing tap water are approximately 27 mj m3 and 1 628 kg co2 equiv m3 respectively stokes and horvath 2009 tap water was estimated to cost 0 9 m3 conventional and urine diverting restrooms are estimated to cost 200 and 700 respectively per toilet ishii and boyer 2015 the environmental impacts of manufacturing and installing conventional and urine diverting restrooms are considered equivalent disregarding the environmental impacts of these two types of equipment the infrastructure inputs of the urine treatment unit collection tank bioreactor tank and concentration tank included pipe steel concrete and excavation electricity was used for mixing aeration and pumping the infrastructure input data were obtained from cashman et al 2014 the energy input ghg emission and cost were calculated using data from our previous studies zheng et al 2017 and the electricity consumption data for the operation of the urine bioreactor tank and concentration tank were obtained from zheng et al 2017 and ek et al 2006 respectively under aeration conditions the conversion ratio of nitrogen of nitrous oxide to nitrogen of consumed ammonia was assumed to be 1 7 as evaluated in a full scale nitritation bioreactor kampschreur et al 2008 the capital cost of the tanks was estimated using a unit price per volume of approximately 60 m3 hao and hao 2009 life cycle inventory data for chemicals electricity and construction materials were obtained from the gabi database the price of electricity was set at 0 12 kwh from the literature law et al 2015 the gabi database was used to obtain the life cycle inventory energy and ghg emissions of ammonium nitrate the price of ammonium nitrate which contains 15 nitrogen was assumed to be 220 ton alibaba website in addition the environmental and economic benefits of urine source separation for the downstream wwtp were addressed the primary difference between scenarios a and b in the wwtp is the need for electricity for aeration pumping and mixing according to a recent report by badeti et al 2021 urine diversion can lower the overall wwtp energy consumption from approximately 0 58 to 0 45 kwh m3 total ghg emission from 1 95 to 1 4 kg co2 equiv m3 and total cost from 0 41 to 0 34 m3 3 results 3 1 production of ammonium nitrate from urine by a two stage nitrification method the feasibility of the established two stage nitrification method for producing ammonium nitrate from high strength human urine was evaluated through long term experiments in aob and nob bioreactors the following experimental results provide evidence in favor of the technical feasibility of this method 3 1 1 stable partial nitritation in an aob bioreactor as shown in fig 3 partial nitritation of the aob bioreactor tended to be stable with the nar approaching 100 as ammonium nitrogen in the aob bioreactor influent increased from 700 mg n l to 1500 mg n l within approximately 40 d during the subsequent 41 100 d the average ammonium and nitrite concentrations in the effluent stabilized at 600 70 and 515 50 mg n l respectively whereas nitrate was undetectable meanwhile the ph of the effluent gradually decreased and stabilized at 6 0 0 1 due to alkalinity consumption in the urine caused by proton production in the nitritation processes at such a low ph fna accumulated to a very high level about 1 0 mg hno2 n l and considerably inhibited nob as reported in previous literatures zheng et al 2017 zuo et al 2022 as the ammonium concentration in the influent of the aob bioreactor further increased from 1200 to 1500 mg n l on day 101 the effluent ammonium concentration gradually increased and was maintained at 800 100 mg n l during the subsequent operation 81 150 d while the nitrite concentration in the effluent almost remained unchanged 560 80 mg n l meanwhile the ph of the aob bioreactor effluent increased dramatically to 7 5 0 8 these differences indicated that aob activity was partially inhibited failing to convert half of the ammonium to nitrite and increasing ph because of the elevated ammonium concentration in the influent of the aob bioreactor the high strength fa was primarily responsible for suppressing the aob activity a similar fa inhibitory effect was observed in a previous study zuo et al 2022 if the ammonia concentration in urine increases the continuous stirred tank bioreactor cstr operation can be employed to prevent fa inhibition on aob as previously demonstrated in the literature fumasoli et al 2016 notably ammonium and nitrite concentrations decreased after day 120 without a nitrogen balance between the influent and the effluent fig s1 this could be because increasing the ph of the bioreactor produces more ammonia nitrogen which tends to volatilize under aerobic conditions additional factors must be identified in future studies 3 1 2 ammonium nitrate production in a nob bioreactor nob were cultured with synthetic water for 83 d before the vitrified urine of the aob bioreactor was fed into the nob bioreactor the initial nitrite concentration in the synthetic water was approximately 300 mg n l during the cultivation increasing to 325 mg n l on day 23 and 600 mg n l on day 45 fig 4 a the ph of the synthetic water was maintained at 6 0 to match the ph of the vitrified urine in the aob bioreactor this gradual increase in nitrogen input was expected to result in nob enrichment as shown in fig 4b the nitrate concentration in the nob bioreactor effluent began to fluctuate during day 60 and gradually stabilized at 600 mg n l after day 60 however the ph increased to approximately 9 0 a thermodynamic model with consideration of the equilibriums of weak acid base and complex formation reactions text s2 could explain that the ph increase is primarily related to the gas exchange of carbon dioxide due to bubble aeration text s3 fig s2 before connecting the aob and nob bioreactors a preliminary batch experiment was performed to test if nob remained active at a low ph a detailed experimental method is provided in text s1 when the initial nitrite concentration was approximately 5 mg n l the nob activity at ph 5 82 0 16 was close to neutral ph 7 8 indicating that nob were not inhibited at a low ph fig s3 this finding demonstrates the ability of nob to treat the aob bioreactor s low ph vitrified urine as a result on day 84 we used vitrified urine from an aob bioreactor instead of synthetic water as the influent of the nob bioreactor the water quality of aob vitrified urine is described above in section 3 1 1 fig 4b shows that using vitrified urine as the influent resulted in a quick increase in ammonium of the nob bioreactor effluent which remained at 776 140 mg n l after 90 d at an average nitrate output of 643 123 mg n l the nitrite was still entirely converted to nitrate nar 0 as a result the ammonium to nitrate ratio in the effluent nitrogen component is almost 1 1 notably after injecting vitrified urine of aob on day 84 the ph in the effluent began to fall and remained stable at 6 0 for 100 150 d the leading cause of the ph drop is that the aeration process does not influence the equilibrium of ionic distribution due to the very low alkalinity in the influent consumed in the aob bioreactor a high strength ammonium nitrate solution was generated via the proposed two stage nitrification method providing the necessary prerequisites for subsequent concentrations using established technology 3 1 3 recovery of additional nutrient components from urine in addition to nitrogen phosphorus and potassium are important nutrient components in fertilizers but their sources are unsustainable due to fossil energy or extraction from limited ore reserves larsen et al 2013 because urine includes half of the phosphorus and potassium in domestic wastewater recovering them from human urine is a possible alternative previous techniques have primarily focused on the recovery of different nutrients separately e g one well established method of recovering phosphorus from urine is to combine it with magnesium to form struvite fertilizer etter et al 2011 liu et al 2013 tilley et al 2008 we demonstrated that the developed two stage nitrification method could recover nitrogen phosphorus and potassium from urine many times in addition to nitrogen chemical analysis revealed that most phosphorus 75 3 and potassium 96 1 in urine were retained in the ammonium nitrate solution the phosphorus was not completely recovered probably due to the possibility of precipitation 3 2 energy input ghg emission and cost estimation the experimental results above demonstrated the technical feasibility of the developed two stage microbial nitrification method for producing fertilizer from urine two scenarios were examined to further evaluate the practical feasibility of the developed two stage nitrification method at a large urban scale scenario a was a conventional wastewater treatment method and agricultural synthetic fertilizer was used in scenario b a urine diverting restroom was used and the separated urine was treated to produce ammonium nitrate the annual ammonium nitrate production was estimated to be 24 6 tons n equivalent to 468 6 tons of ammonium nitrate n content is approximately 15 the energy inputs ghg emission and expenses of these two scenarios are compared in supplementary information table s1 the results are summarized in fig 5 urine diversion for fertilizer production using the developed two stage nitrification method i e scenario b effectively reduced the total energy input by 43 ghg emission by 40 and cost by 33 compared to the conventional system scenario a these were comparable to the overall performance e g 26 41 energy input reduction 29 47 ghg emission reduction of other urine treatment technologies such as urine concentration alternative or struvite precipitation hilton et al 2021 the energy input in scenario a was primarily provided by three components urine flush water wwtp operation and synthetic fertilizer with urine flush water accounting for half of the overall energy input for flushing urine 13 1 m3 of freshwater water was required per person per year and freshwater production was considered an important source of energy input synthetic fertilizer had the next largest impact on the energy input in scenario b the urine diverting restroom greatly reduced flushing water use 1 1 m3 per person per year resulting in an energy input reduction of 300 mj per person per year the proposed two stage nitrification method only increased energy input by a small amount 100 mj per person per year however the subsequent ammonium nitrate concentration process needed more energy 200 mj per person per year to remove 80 of the water from ammonium nitrate solution in this technique reverse osmosis was designed as a urine concentration process since it was proved to completely recover nitrogen from acidified urine e g at ph 6 0 with a low energy input 30 w h l 1 regarding ghg emissions the operation of wwtps was responsible for the largest impacts in both scenarios according to badeti et al 2021 direct emissions from nitrification denitrification and oxidation processes to remove chemical oxygen demand were reduced but indirect emissions from energy consumption were only slightly reduced in scenario a synthetic fertilizer production would generate 20 5 kg co2e per person per year in scenario b the expenses of constructing a urine diverting restroom and three tanks and their operation were estimated to increase by 12 6 per person per year yet saving flush water in urine diverting restrooms reduced freshwater production costs by 16 3 per person per year urine diversion reduced the influent nutrient load lowering the wwtp s operating costs by 3 3 per person per year notably the production of ammonium nitrate fertilizer from urine could offset synthetic fertilizer production worth 10 3 per person each year the developed two stage nitrification method like previous urine treatment methods has the potential to reduce most environmental impacts e g energy usage and ghg emission while also lowering per capita costs our analysis did not consider other positive impacts resulting from the simultaneous recovery of phosphorus and potassium in the ammonium nitrate solution therefore the expected environmental and economic benefits may be significant 4 discussion 4 1 technical advantages of the two stage nitrification method this study accomplished stable urine nitrification using a novel two stage nitrification method in which half of the ammonium was converted to nitrite by aob in the first bioreactor and then to nitrate by nob in the second bioreactor figs 3 and 4 several studies have demonstrated that fna inactivates nob more effectively than aob and relatively high concentrations of fna completely inhibit aob activity several efforts have been undertaken to prevent fna inhibition on nob in a coexisting system duan et al 2020 jiang et al 2018 wang et al 2014 intermittent urine feeding to keep the ph value within a restricted range 6 0 7 2 is one solution but the process destabilization remains the current challenge this challenge was addressed in this study by a new alternative in which aob and nob exist in two independent systems so that their activities do not interfere another advantage of this two stage nitrification method is that high level fna accumulation in the aob bioreactor may help simultaneously eliminate antibiotics antibiotic resistance genes and pathogens from urine this is due to fna induced cell lysis and the breakdown of macromolecular substances liu et al 2022 for example sulfamethoxazole could be effectively eliminated by 95 5 with the accumulation of fna during urine nitritation cheng et al 2021 some researchers found that fna pretreatment of activated sludge improved pathogen reduction by 2 1 0 2 logs in anaerobic digestion indicating that fna positively impacted pathogen removal wei et al 2018 however more research into the urine system is required these impacts could expand the advantages of the proposed method for recycling urine as a cleaner agricultural fertilizer 4 2 challenges and further research although long term experimental results demonstrated that aob and nob activities could play typical roles in respective bioreactors process instability must still be addressed the key problem affecting the aob bioreactor s process stability is the inhibition of aob by fa when the feed conditions e g urine dilution ratio are dynamic and difficult to control as shown in the data after day 81 in fig 3b this can be rectified by switching the bioreactor s operational mode to cstr the factor impacting process stability in the nob bioreactor running continuously at ph 6 0 is nob inhibition by fna when the feeding i e aob bioreactor effluent containing high strength nitrite is fast another potential issue is the growth of acid tolerant aob fumasoli et al 2016 certain acid tolerant strains e g nitrosococcus have been observed to reduce ph to as low as 2 2 fumasoli et al 2017 such extremely low ph levels could jeopardize process stability while releasing large volumes of harmful gasses such as nitric oxide nitrogen dioxide and nitrous oxide udert et al 2005 fumasoli et al 2017 zuo et al 2022 although our experiment did not have an extremely low ph further studies are required previously considerable work has been done to improve process stability through process control such as a combination of cascade and feed forward constrained control jamilis et al 2020 electrochemical nitrite sensing control thürlimann et al 2019 britschgi et al 2020 or mathematical model control volcke et al 2007 these control methods should make the nob bioreactor more stable controlling biomass retention time is another consideration in this study biomass was nearly never released which helps to reduce sludge treatment however this mode is unusual in practice many studies have shown that biomass retention time is a crucial factor affecting process stability and selecting an appropriate biomass retention time facilitates eliminating microorganisms that adversely affect the stable functioning of bioreactors dang et al 2022 lin et al 2023 nguyen et al 2021 this deserves further investigation in the proposed systems future studies should concentrate on higher tan strength and dynamic feeding conditions the tan concentration of urine in our experiment was less than 1500 mg n l which is still lower than certain separated urine concentrations furthermore practical urine feeding typically fluctuates dynamically which severely impacts the stability of the nitrification process 5 conclusions in summary based on experimental environmental and economic impact assessments this study proposed and examined a two stage nitrification method using aob and nob in two independent bioreactors the key findings are as follows 1 this two stage nitrification method could consistently convert half of the ammonium in high strength urine into nitrate resulting in a standard ammonium nitrate solution 2 urine diversion for liquid fertilizer production using a two stage nitrification method with ro dewatering might reduce total energy input by 43 ghg emission by 40 and cost by 33 compared to conventional wastewater treatment without urine diversion 3 in future investigations the operating conditions of the proposed two stage nitrification method can be further adjusted to improve process stability declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

14928,fiber the most prevalent plastic type can be weathered and eroded easily in the natural environment although a variety of techniques have been applied to characterize the aging characteristics of plastics a comprehensive understanding was critically essential to correlate the multi dimensional assessment of the weathering process of microfibers and their environmental behavior therefore in this study microfibers were prepared from the face masks and pb2 was selected as a typical metal pollutant the weathering process was simulated by xenon aging and chemical aging and then subjected to pb2 adsorption to examine the effect of weathering processes the changes in fiber property and structure were detected by using various characterization techniques with the development of several aging indices to quantify the changes the two dimensional fourier transform infrared correlation spectroscopy analysis 2d ftir cos and raman mapping were also performed to understand the order of changes in the surface functional groups of the fiber the results showed that both aging processes altered the surface morphology physicochemical properties and polypropylene chain conformations of the microfibers with stronger effect after chemical aging the aging process also enhanced the affinity of microfiber to pb2 moreover the changes and correlation of the aging indices were analyzed showing that the maximum adsorption capacity qmax was positively related to carbonyl index ci oxygen to carbon atom o c ratio and intensity ratio of the raman peaks i841 808 but negatively related to contact angle and the temperature at the maximum weight loss rate tm the o c ratio was more suitable to quantify the surface changes with lower aging degree while the ci value explained the chemical aging process better overall this study discussed the weathering processes of microfibers based on a multi dimensional investigation and attempted to correlate the aging characteristics of the microfibers and their environmental behavior graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microfibers aging face masks adsorption correlation quantitative data availability data will be made

abundant shape of the microplastics the aging processes of the microfibers were rarely studied the already published studies related to microfibers mainly reported the existence of microfibers as the dominant microplastics in the environment and organisms ashjar et al 2023 yang et al 2021 yu et al 2023b only several studies analyzed the characteristics of the aged microfibers ropes and polylactic acid masks and their adsorption capacity to the other pollutants without the dynamic changes of microfibers in aging processes bhagwat et al 2021 tang et al 2020 yu et al 2023a moreover in view of the increasingly severe microfiber pollution exacerbated by the covid 19 it is very necessary to evaluate the changes and environmental impact of microfibers during weathering processes the aging characteristics of microplastics were examined through the application of many techniques bai et al 2022 bhagat et al 2022 chen et al 2021b such as fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps raman spectroscopy thermogravimetric analyzer tga etc these methods can analyze the changes in physical and chemical properties of the microplastics after weathering for example ftir and xps were selected to investigate the aging behaviors of polystyrene microplastics after fenton aging lang et al 2020 liu et al 2020 tga was used to analyze the thermal decomposition characteristics of polyethylene microplastics after xenon aging luo et al 2020 however even using these techniques many studies failed to combine the results to comprehensively discuss the relationship of data from different methods it was still a question that whether the techniques above were enough or closely related to give a full picture of the weathering processes some others quantified the aging characteristics by using some indices such as carbonyl index ci oxygen to carbon atom o c ratio contact angle etc chen et al 2021b liu et al 2019 however are these quantification indices correlated with each other and do they reflect the differences of various aging methods furthermore some studies investigated the effect of weathering on the interactions of microplastics with other pollutants by conducting adsorption desorption experiments bhagwat et al 2021 tang et al 2020 and found that weathering affected the adsorption desorption behavior of microplastics however is it possible to link the environmental behavior and the property variations in a quantitative way what s more until now most of the studies focused on the weathering of microplastics in shapes of granule or plate chen et al 2021b lang et al 2020 liu et al 2020 what differences can be expected on fiber shape microplastics to answer the questions above the disposable masks were selected representatively in this study disposable masks have become important sources of microfibers in the environment during the pandemic of the new coronavirus covid 19 mghili et al 2022 a hong kong based marine conservation organization reported that 1 56 billion masks were flowed into the ocean in 2020 oceansasia 2020 our recent study estimated that around 104 microfibers could be released from one disposable facemask into the environment under mechanical abrasion wu et al 2022 it was also found that microfibers were released from the masks into urban rivers together with the attachment of other environmental pollutants wang et al 2022 but there were still limited studies on face masks especially their aging behavior in this way taking the microfibers from face masks would be helpful to assess the fate of the fiber plastics in the environment therefore in this work microfibers were prepared from the face masks and pb2 was selected as a typical metal pollutant the weathering process was simulated by xenon aging and chemical aging and then subjected to pb2 adsorption to examine the effect of weathering processes the changes in fiber property and structure were detected in multiple dimensions by using a variety of characterization techniques the changes of aging indices such as contact angle carbonyl index o c ratio tm etc were analyzed and the ftir spectra were further evaluated by the two dimensional correlation analysis 2d cos the correlation analysis was performed to reveal the link between the aging indices and the environmental effects of microfibers principal component analysis pca was further conducted to disclose the different mechanisms of the two aging processes this study intended to give a full picture of the weathering processes of microfibers via multi dimensional investigation and to disclose the potential relationship between the aging characteristics and the environmental behavior of the microfibers 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample preparation and weathering a commercial surgical mask was purchased from the chinese domestic market and the outer layer of the mask was selected for this study the type of the outer layer was identified as polypropylene pp by attenuated total reflectance micro fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr μftir and then cut into small disks with a diameter of 5 mm potassium persulfate k2s2o8 and lead nitrate pb no3 2 were purchased from shanghai aladdin biochemical technology co ltd a xenon aging test chamber zhoxd 80p sailham equipment co ltd china was used to simulate the aging in full sunlight spectrum the kinetic aging experiment was performed separately and individually for different time intervals 2 4 6 and 20 days for each experiment 1 0 g of microfibers and 250 ml of milli q water were added to a glass petri dish and stirred well by a glass rod then the dish was placed in the aging chamber at 60 c under humidity of 80 and light irradiance of 1000 w m2 during weathering the samples were stirred regularly twice a day with a glass rod and the aged microfibers were obtained from every individual experiment after being washed and dried the pp microfibers were preserved and denoted as xen 2 4 6 20day for the following experiments meanwhile the chemical aging of thermal activated k2s2o8 was used to simulate the accelerated aging process the chemical aging treatment was performed similar to the xenon aging but with different time intervals 1 2 4 and 6 days in each treatment group 1 0 g of microfiber sample and 250 ml of k2s2o8 ph 7 0 0 1 mol l were mixed in a 500 ml glass conical flask and was then placed in a constant temperature oscillator for aging at 60 c with a speed of 180 rpm to ensure the persistence of the oxidant the aging solution was replaced by 250 ml of fresh k2s2o8 solution every 48 h each experiment group was conducted in duplicates the microfibers were aged following the above procedures and samples were recovered accordingly the collected microfibers were washed dried stored and denoted as oxi 1 2 4 6 day for the subsequent experiments 2 2 batch adsorption experiments 0 6 g of the aged microfibers were added into a 500 ml conical flask with 300 ml of pb2 solution ph 5 0 10 mg l and then the flask was shaken at 180 rpm and 25 c in a constant temperature oscillator for adsorption kinetics 2 ml of solution samples were taken at preset time intervals 5 min 10 min 20 min 30 min 1 h 2 h 4 h 8 h 13 h 24 h 36 h 48 h 60 h and was then filtered through a 0 45 μm glass fiber filter the experiments for adsorption isotherms were carried out following the same conditions as mentioned above but with pb2 concentrations of 5 10 15 20 and 25 mg l the outer layer of the original mask without weathering was used as a blank control group each experiment was repeated in duplicates the pseudo first order model and pseudo second order model were used to describe the adsorption kinetics while langmuir and freundlich isotherm equations were used for adsorption isotherms details in section 1 of the supporting information si 2 3 characterization and data analysis morphology of the microfibers was observed by scanning electron microscope sem merlin zeiss germany surface properties and molecular structure of the microfibers were examined by attenuated total reflectance micro fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr μftir nicolet in10 mx thermo fisher scientific usa x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps phi 5000 versaprobe ⅲ ulvac phi japan and confocal raman microscopy labram hr evolution horiba france furthermore the thermodynamic properties of the microfibers were detected using thermogravimetric analyzer tga setsys evo easy 1750 setaram france while the contact angles of the microfibers were measured using a drop shape analyzer dsa25b krüss germany at room temperature moreover the 2d cos analysis was conducted based on one dimensional ftir spectral data to explore the change order of the functional group of microfibers during weathering the area scan mode 8 μm 8 μm of confocal raman microscopy was used to record the intensity ratio of peaks at 841 and 808 cm 1 of the microfiber to detect the changes in the crystallization degree the correlation analysis and pca were also performed to further understand the aging mechanisms of microfibers all statistical analyses were performed using origin 2021 or spss 22 0 software an effect with p 0 05 was considered significant the details for the above characterizations were provided in section i of the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 observable changes in morphology and properties 3 1 1 morphology evolution as demonstrated in fig 1 a the surface of the pristine pp microfiber surface was relatively smooth with a diameter of about 20 μm after chemical aging for 1 day the holes appeared on the fiber surface fig 1 b while cracking was observed after 2 days fig 1 c with nanoplastics generated and adhered on the fiber surface fig s1 a of si with prolonged aging time the cracks of the microfibers became much denser deeper and wider fig 1 b e and finally the microfibers were completely fractured into granular form after 7 days fig s1 b of si therefore further experiments on the chemically aged microfibers were conducted based on the aging processes within 6 days meanwhile in the xenon aging process fig 1 f i rough surface was observed for the aged pp microfibers with the formation of bumps and some specific textures were observed after aging for 20 days but without cracks overall the changes in microfiber morphology were different when subjected to different aging processes xenon or chemical aging the morphology changes were more observable for the chemically aged pp microfibers than those after xenon aging indicating much more serious impact caused by chemical aging processes the cracked and wrinkled surface of the pp microfibers was similar to the phenomenon observed for the aged textiles schellenberger et al 2022 3 1 2 functional group evolution fig 1 j collated the ftir spectra of microfibers before and after aging and table s1 summarized the spectral assignments of the ftir bands the absorption peaks of 2700 3000 cm 1 were mainly attributed to the stretching vibration of c h in ch3 and ch2 while the bending vibrations of c h mainly affected the absorption peaks at 1300 1475 1166 972 and 997 cm 1 furthermore after aging new carbonyl peaks from 1660 to 1800 cm 1 were detected which belonged to the stretching vibration of carbonyl c o lactone ester ketone carboxylic acid etc the maximum absorbance peak of the carbonyl was observed at 1708 cm 1 and 1726 cm 1 for samples after chemical and xenon aging respectively and the intensity was increased gradually with prolonged aging time fig s2 of si this phenomenon indicates that chemical changes occurred during weathering resulting in the breaking of the c c bonds and the formation of c o functional groups chen et al 2021b resmeriță et al 2018 the intensity of the carbonyl peak of the microfibers after chemical aging was much higher than that after xenon aging suggesting faster and stronger damage under chemical aging raman spectroscopy was sensitive to the changes in the chain conformation of polymer and it was usually used to study the regularity and local structure of polymers shrestha et al 2018 therefore in this study the changes in the chemical structure of microfibers were probed using a confocal raman microscopy with spectra demonstrated in fig 1 k and vibrational assignment summarized in table s1 of si the peak at 973 cm 1 was mainly associated with asymmetrical stretching of the axial c c bond and that at 998 cm 1 was related to the rocking of the methyl ch3 lateral group with aging processes proceeding the intensity of the peak at 973 cm 1 was decreased gradually while that at 998 cm 1 was increased slowly the results indicated that the asymmetric stretching vibration of the c c bond of the fiber was weakened during weathering but the lateral ch3 rocking was enhanced furthermore the peak at 1168 cm 1 was originated from the tensile and swing vibration of c c and its intensity was decreased gradually and showed a blue shifting showing the weakening of the tensile and oscillatory vibrations of c c with aging processes based on the peak changes above it can be inferred that the c c bond was broken to form ch3 which further indicated the damage of long pp chain caused by aging in addition the peak at 1530 cm 1 was due to the vibration of the c n c bridge bonds of the phthalocyanine macrocycle a structure belonging to copper phthalocyanine shaibat et al 2010 tackley et al 2001 usually used as an organic pigment the peak was declined significantly for chemical aging samples attributed to the worse color fading of this aging method fig s1 b of si 3 2 deeper analysis in structural changes by raman mapping and 2d ftir cos 3 2 1 structural changes by raman mapping pp is a semi crystalline polymer the results of one dimensional raman spectroscopy fig 1 k showed that the raman peaks at 808 and 841 cm 1 were correlated to the helical chain of the crystal region and the short helical segment with isomeric defects respectively the intensity ratio of the two peaks i841 808 was used to assess the changes in the crystallinity and conformation of pp microfibers after aging nielsen et al 2002 yan et al 2021 therefore the two dimensional raman spectroscopy raman mapping test was further performed an area 8 μm 8 μm of microfiber was arbitrarily selected and then the intensity ratio of the peaks at 841 and 808 cm 1 i841 808 in this area was detected by the area scan mode of confocal raman microscopy the mapping results in fig 2 a illustrated that the i841 808 value was increased gradually as aging progressed in aging processes the isomeric defects were introduced into the trans gauche conformation and the c c coupling was partially lost as a result nielsen et al 2002 the side group mode of ch2 rocking became the main contributor to the potential energy distribution for 841 cm 1 band causing a shift of raman band from 808 to 841 cm 1 moreover the introduction of isomeric defects reduced the crystallinity of the microfibers therefore the i841 808 value of fibers was increased with prolonged aging time as demonstrated in fig 2 a furthermore a greater increase in i841 808 value was observed for fibers after chemical aging from 0 399 0 0104 to 1 124 0 0191 compared to xenon aging from 0 399 0 0104 to 0 905 0 0193 indicating the stronger effect of the chemical aging in addition the i841 808 value after 4 days of chemical aging was comparable to the value after 20 days of xenon aging showing a faster aging process by chemical oxidation 3 2 2 potential sequence of changes in functional groups by 2d ftir cos the 2d cos analysis was carried out based on one dimensional ftir spectral data within the range of 900 1900 cm 1 the synchronous maps in fig 2 b c demonstrated very different peak distribution between the two aging conditions in xenon aging fig 2 b three peaks at 972 cm 1 ch 1376 cm 1 ch3 and 1726 cm 1 c o on the diagonal line were auto peaks but the synchronous correlation intensity was low suggesting that these bands were slightly sensitive to the disturbances caused by aging moreover the cross peaks in the synchronization diagram were positive implying the same direction of the changes in peak intensity in chemical aging fig 2 c an auto peak was observed at 1708 cm 1 c o along the diagonal line with significantly higher intensity than those of the xenon aging showing that the microfibers were more sensitive to chemical oxidization moreover a negative cross peak at φ 972 1708 indicated the opposite direction of the two bands at 972 and 1708 cm 1 asynchronous mapping fig 2 b c is about diagonal antisymmetric with no auto peaks but only cross peaks at off diagonal positions ding et al 2020 different asynchronous maps were observed when the 2d cos maps were compared between the two aging processes fig 2 b c the map of xenon aging samples was found with negative cross peaks of ψ 972 997 1166 1708 ψ 997 1708 ψ 1166 1708 and positive cross peaks ψ 997 1166 meanwhile the map of chemical aging presented six positive cross peaks at ψ 972 1376 1455 1726 ψ 1376 1455 1726 and ψ 1455 1726 based on noda s rules noda 1993 combining synchronous and asynchronous correlation spectroscopy can reveal the change order of specific chemical bonds during aging therefore the subsequent results were summarized in table s2 and s3 of si showing the assignment and sign of each cross peak in the synchronous and asynchronous maps of microfibers after aging the aging sequence of the microfibers in xenon aging was as follows 972 cm 1 ch symmetric bending 1708 cm 1 c o vibration 997 cm 1 ch asymmetric bending 1166 cm 1 ch3 bending while in chemical aging processes the order of functional groups involved was 972 cm 1 ch symmetric bending 1376 cm 1 ch3 bending 1726 cm 1 c o vibration to summarize the functional group of ch symmetric bending changed at first and was followed by the c o vibration the sequence indicated that the ch groups on the carbon chain were more likely to be oxidized to c o groups in the aging process and more carbonyl groups were produced in chemical aging processes due to bond scission by sufficient so4 radicals in addition there were c o peaks rather than c c peaks observed in both raman and ftir spectra showing that the c o groups were preferentially formed when the c c bond of pp was broken combining the results of 2d ftir cos and raman spectroscopy and other studies about the main routes and oxidation products of pp degradation kirkbride and norrish 1931 rajakumar et al 2009 the aging mechanisms for the formation of carbonyl c o in pp microfibers can be illustrated by the reaction pathways in fig 2 d when pp microfibers were weathered under photo oxidation or advanced oxidation the c h bonds preferably tertiary hydrogen in the polymer backbone were susceptible to be attacked by the reactive oxygen radicals this reaction led to the breaking of the c h bond triggering a free radical chain reaction in the polymer and further generating alkyl radicals the alkyl radicals combined with oxygen to form the alkoxy radicals which subsequently reacted with polymer backbone to form the carbonyl groups c o based on previous reports stark and matuana 2004 the c o generated may continue to degrade via the norrish reaction if the c o was degraded according to the norrish i reaction the resulting free radicals can attack the pp material which may cause termination through cross linking or chain scission if the degradation was followed by the norrish ii reaction carbonyl groups and terminal vinyl groups were formed and the chain scission occurred specially although c o were produced ultimately by pp microfibers under both xenon aging and chemical aging the reaction processes under the two aging methods were inconsistent xenon aging belongs to photodegradation triggered by simulated natural light while chemical aging is oxidative degradation triggered by so4 generated by thermally activated k2s2o8 johnson et al 2008 ftir results also confirmed the inconsistent reaction process fig 1 j the maximum absorption peaks of the generated c o usually composed of aldehydes ketones etc were observed at 1726 cm 1 and 1708 cm 1 for samples after xenon and chemical aging respectively the different position of peaks indicated the different components of c o and the unlike reaction processes under the two aging methods 3 3 changes in adsorption behavior of microfibers elucidated by pb2 pb2 was selected representatively to evaluate the interference of aging process on the interactions of pp microfibers and other pollutant in the environment fig 3 illustrated the fitting results of pb2 adsorption on the raw and aged microfibers and the parameters of the adsorption kinetics models were listed in table s4 of si in fig 3 a c pb2 was adsorbed rapidly onto the microfibers at the first 1 h and then slowed down with prolonged time until reaching equilibrium at about 8 h when comparing the adsorption kinetics of microfibers aged at different time it can be found that the pb2 adsorption can be well fitted by both pseudo first order fig 3 a c and pseudo second order models fig s5 a c of si at the initial stage of aging both chemical aging and xenon aging however with the aging time extending the adsorption process was fitted much better by the pseudo second order model the phenomenon indicated that the pb2 adsorption on the pristine microfibers may be physisorption but chemical interaction gradually dominated as aging progressed overall the adsorption kinetics were fitted better to the pseudo second order model for the aged fibers suggesting that the chemical adsorption became the rate limiting step of pb2 adsorption with continuous aging processes furthermore the fitting results of adsorption isotherms were shown in fig 3 b d with parameters given in table s5 of si the nonlinear adsorption of pb2 was observed over the entire concentration range indicating the heterogeneity of adsorption sites on the microfiber surface shen et al 2021 tang et al 2020 however the correlation coefficient values obtained from the langmuir model were better than that of the freundlich model fig s5 b d of si implying that the adsorption of pb2 on microfibers may be monolayer adsorption moreover the maximum adsorption capacity qmax of pb2 was increased with the enhanced aging effect fig 3 with the value from 0 342 mg g of the original fiber to 1 335 mg g and 0 792 mg g respectively after chemical 6 days and xenon aging 20 days for the original pp microfibers their surface charge was negative at ph 5 0 and thus electrostatic interaction was the major mechanism for attachment of the positively charged pb2 meanwhile the aging process changed the physicochemical properties of the microfibers as indicated by the changes of ci values and o c ratio fig 4 then the oxygen containing functional groups were involved in complexation or chelation with the pb2 rather than physisorption lesmana et al 2009 tang et al 2020 which enhanced the affinity of microfibers to pb2 therefore both adsorption kinetics and isotherms indicated that the aging process enhanced the binding capacity of pb2 to microfibers a stronger effect was observed by chemical aging compared to xenon aging which was due to greater variation in surface oxygen containing functional groups contact angle and the conformation of polypropylene helical chains etc to further clarify the adsorption process of pb2 on pp microfibers the weber morris model was used to fit the kinetic process fig 3 e with parameters summarized in table s6 of si the adsorption process of pb2 on the pristine fiber can be divided into two stages the intercept of the fitting line for the first stage was close to the origin indicating that the rate of the adsorption was mainly limited by the intraparticle diffusion however the adsorption process of the aged fiber can be divided into three stages rapid adsorption stage transition stage and quasi equilibrium stage the fitting lines of the aged fibers did not cross the origin meaning that the rate controlling step was not intraparticle diffusion alone moreover the intercept values of the aged fiber in the three adsorption stages were larger than those of the pristine pp microfibers table s6 of si which was mainly attributed to the increase in adsorption sites on the surface of the aged fiber resulting in enhanced mass transfer driving force for pb2 diffusion inside the pp microfibers 3 4 correlation between critical aging indices and environmental behaviors 3 4 1 quantitative indices hydrophilicity related contact angle was highly affected by surface functional groups of the polymers chen et al 2021b which can be used to evaluate the changes of fiber surface during aging quantitatively the microfiber prepared from the outer layer of the surgical masks was extremely hydrophobic with contact angle of 133 3 0 69 and the contact angle was decreased to 126 8 2 80 and 124 0 0 98 after xenon and chemical aging respectively fig 4 a e the slight decrease in the contact angle indicated that the hydrophobicity of microfibers was decreased during weathering which was due to the formation of oxygen containing functional groups on fiber surface resmeriță et al 2018 however even after aging processes the fiber surface was still highly hydrophobic furthermore the ci value is always regarded as an important indicator to quantify the aging degree of the plastics liu et al 2019 it refers to the relative abundance of the carbonyl groups and is calculated as the ratio of the maximum intensity of the carbonyl peak 1660 1800 cm 1 to that of the reference peak of the ftir spectra wu et al 2021 the peak at 2917 cm 1 is stable and characteristic for the pp polymer brandon et al 2016 and thus it was chosen as the reference peak after calculation the ci value was illustrated in fig 4 b f showing that the ci of the fiber was increased from the original value 0 020 0 0014 to 0 063 0 0060 and 0 263 0 0050 after xenon and chemical aging respectively a higher ci value after chemical aging further indicated a stronger weathering effect in chemical aging than xenon aging moreover the o c ratio was calculated based on the area proportion of o 1 s and c 1 s peaks of the xps spectra fig s3 of si and the results were summarized in fig 4 c g generally speaking the o c ratio was amplified with the aging processes going on in xenon aging the ratio was increased gradually from 0 037 0 0057 to 0 103 0 0021 on the 20th day suggesting the continuous formation of some oxygen containing groups meanwhile in chemical aging the ratio grew significantly to 0 133 0 0028 even after aging for 2 days and then kept relatively stable at 0 133 0 142 at the beginning of the chemical aging the surface of the microfiber was oxidized quickly and strongly resulting in a dramatic increase in the o c ratio however as the aging proceeded the available sites for oxidation reactions were limited without obvious amplification in the o c ratio in addition the changes in temperatures for thermal decomposition of the microfibers can be another quantitative evaluation on aging characteristics fig 4 d h showed the thermogravimetric curve of the microfibers before and after different aging processes after xenon aging the microfibers were decomposed at 390 495 c fig 4 d while the temperature at the maximum weight loss rate tm remained constantly at 465 469 c fig s4 a of si however the microfibers after chemical aging was mainly decomposed at 362 492 c together with a slight decomposition at 160 330 c fig 5 h and the tm was decreased to 452 6 c after aging 6 days fig s4 b of si the mass loss rate of microfibers was ranging from 4 to 6 when the chemical aging time was from 2 to 6 days compared with the original fiber and the fiber after xenon aging the obvious changes in thermal behavior after chemical aging were attributed to the decomposition of short chain molecules generated due to chemical oxidation 3 4 2 correlation analysis fig 5 a summarized the correlation of ci value with prolonged aging time showing a linear correlation for both chemical r2 0 980 and xenon r2 0 768 aging however the o c ratio versus aging time fig 5 b illustrated a significant correlation well described by exponential equations r2 0 999 and 0 967 for chemical and xenon aging respectively with different alteration rates observed throughout the entire processes as aging progressed the trend of ci value was different from that of o c ratio which might be due to the different penetration depths of the atr μftir and xps technique bhagat et al 2022 atr μftir allows for a micrometer thick surface analysis while xps probes the nanometer depth the aging of pp microfibers was started from the surface and a longer time was usually needed for the interior oxidation of the polymer in the early aging stage the gradual increase of oxygen containing functional groups on the fiber surface led to a linear relationship between o c ratio and ci value with the aging time with increase in the aging degree the structural change of the microfibers would be transferred from the surface to the interior however as a non contact spectral analysis technology xps is only suitable for surface analysis at nanometer depth and not conducive to reflect the changes below the nanometer surface layer causing a plateauing of the o c ratio in the later aging stages in contrast atr μftir is a contact type measurement method suitable for detecting surface changes at micrometer thickness which can reflect the changes below the nanoscale surface layer of the microfibers as a result the ci value from the atr μftir was still increasing with the enhanced aging degree overall in processes with slight aging effect like xenon aging in this study which simulated the natural aging condition the o c ratio was better to reflect the changes in surface properties of the microfibers meanwhile for the artificial accelerated aging like the chemical aging in this study atr μftir measurement ci value was more suitable for probing samples with more severe weathering phenomena furthermore to evaluate the relationship between the aging characteristics and the environmental behavior of microfibers a correlation analysis was conducted between the maximum pb2 adsorption capacity qmax and the quantitative indices contact angle ci o c i841 808 and tm the results in fig 5 c showed that the contact angle ci o c and i841 808 were significantly correlated with each other indicating that the changes of oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of pp microfibers during aging were significantly correlated with the changes of crystallization degree and conformation this is mainly attributed to the destruction of the chemical structure of the microfibers by aging when cross compared qmax was positively related to ci o c and i841 808 but negatively related to the contact angle and tm this showed that the increase of oxygen containing functional groups and the decrease of crystallization degree of pp microfibers during aging would lead to the increase of pb2 adsorption capacity and the decrease of hydrophobicity and maximum weight loss rate temperature tm would also enhance the pb2 adsorption capacity of pp microfibers ding et al ding et al 2020 also found that the decrease of hydrophobicity and the increase of oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of ps microplastics after aging were the main factors leading to the increase of their adsorption capacity for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs overall the correlation results certified that when microfibers are subjected to photodegradation and oxidative degradation during aging their physicochemical properties oxygen containing functional groups hydrophobicity degree of crystallinity etc will be changed and these changes can have a significant impact on the ability of microfibers to adsorb contaminants in addition this means that in future studies researchers may be able to predict the environmental behavior of microplastics by monitoring changes in their aging indices in addition the pca results fig 5 d also pointed out that the characteristics of microfibers were completely separated under both aging processes indicating the significant differences in the aging behavior of microfibers 3 5 environmental implications many evidences demonstrated unequivocally that microfibers were accumulated widespread in aquatic environments browne et al 2011 taylor et al 2016 woodall et al 2014 face masks were reported as an emerging source of microfibers in the era of the covid 19 wang et al 2022 wu et al 2022 together with other common sources such as fabric geotextiles fishing nets etc after releasing into the environment the microfibers will undergo weathering processes afterwards resulting in alterations in their properties and environmental effects for the first time this study combined multi dimensional assessment methods to deeply understand the aging processes of the microfibers from the face masks also correlated the aging characteristics and environmental behavior of microfibers through a variety of newly developed quantitative indices it implied that the subsequent environmental behavior of the aged microfibers may be predicted based on the characteristic indices of the aging processes which would be an interesting point for researchers to assess the environmental risks of the microplastics during weathering processes in natural environment moreover the findings of the suitability of quantitative indices for different aging processes would also shed new sights on future studies about the aging evaluation of the microplastics in addition the results of the microfibers from face masks could help policymakers formulate regulations on the management and disposal of disposable masks especially in the epidemic era 4 conclusion this study combined multi dimensional assessment methods to deeply understand the weathering process of the microfibers from the face masks through simulated xenon and chemical aging besides observable changes in morphologies via techniques such as sem atr μftir and confocal raman microscopy we further explored structure evolutions by adopting raman mapping and 2d ftir cos furthermore the changes in the adsorption capacity of microfibers to pb2 during weathering was investigated the results showed that microfibers could serve as an effective carrier for pb2 transport in aquatic environment and the binding capacity of pb2 to microfibers was enhanced gradually during weathering compared with xenon aging chemical aging had a greater effect on this binding capacity in addition we quantified the aging characteristics and environmental behavior by a variety of indices contact angle ci o c i841 808 tm and qmax and discussed their correlation with each other the correlation analysis showed that the affinity of the microfibers to pb2 qmax was positively related to ci o c and i841 808 but negatively correlated to contact angle and tm pca results pointed out significantly different aging behavior of the microfibers under chemical and xenon aging conditions the o c ratio was more suitable to quantify the surface changes with lower aging degree while the ci value explained the chemical aging process better overall this study provided a comprehensive understanding on the weathering process of microfibers via multi dimensional investigation and disclosed the potential relationship between the aging characteristics and the environmental behavior which favored to assess the environmental behaviors and risks of microfibers in natural and complicated conditions author information jiangpeng li conducted the entire

14928,fiber the most prevalent plastic type can be weathered and eroded easily in the natural environment although a variety of techniques have been applied to characterize the aging characteristics of plastics a comprehensive understanding was critically essential to correlate the multi dimensional assessment of the weathering process of microfibers and their environmental behavior therefore in this study microfibers were prepared from the face masks and pb2 was selected as a typical metal pollutant the weathering process was simulated by xenon aging and chemical aging and then subjected to pb2 adsorption to examine the effect of weathering processes the changes in fiber property and structure were detected by using various characterization techniques with the development of several aging indices to quantify the changes the two dimensional fourier transform infrared correlation spectroscopy analysis 2d ftir cos and raman mapping were also performed to understand the order of changes in the surface functional groups of the fiber the results showed that both aging processes altered the surface morphology physicochemical properties and polypropylene chain conformations of the microfibers with stronger effect after chemical aging the aging process also enhanced the affinity of microfiber to pb2 moreover the changes and correlation of the aging indices were analyzed showing that the maximum adsorption capacity qmax was positively related to carbonyl index ci oxygen to carbon atom o c ratio and intensity ratio of the raman peaks i841 808 but negatively related to contact angle and the temperature at the maximum weight loss rate tm the o c ratio was more suitable to quantify the surface changes with lower aging degree while the ci value explained the chemical aging process better overall this study discussed the weathering processes of microfibers based on a multi dimensional investigation and attempted to correlate the aging characteristics of the microfibers and their environmental behavior graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microfibers aging face masks adsorption correlation quantitative data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microplastics a diverse set of contaminants rather than a single entity are usually classified into different shapes such as fragments fibers films and particles chen et al 2021a rillig 2012 microfiber fibers 5 mm in length is one of the most prevalent types of microplastics detected in the natural environment browne et al 2011 mizraji et al 2017 ryan et al 2020 the main sources of microfibers include textile and tire industries domestic laundering clothing curtains carpets etc ropes and nets arias et al 2022 carr 2017 hartline et al 2016 mason et al 2016 many studies have reported the predominance of microfibers in waters soils sediments and sludges di mauro et al 2022 gago et al 2018 ross et al 2021 wang et al 2017 for example microfibers accounted for more than 88 of the total collected microplastics in beach sediment along the belgian coast claessens et al 2011 and took up 95 of the microplastics in the arctic waters south and southwest of svalbard norway lusher et al 2015 moreover microfibers even occupied the vast majority of microplastics in americans daily food cox et al 2019 causing potential health effects through inhalation or ingestion vethaak and legler 2021 fiber plastics such as apparel textiles masks and geotextiles are easily weathered and eroded in the natural environment bai et al 2022 chen et al 2021a schellenberger et al 2022 tang et al 2020 wu et al 2022 increasing numbers of research have reported that the weathering led to alterations in the properties i e roughness hydrophobicity crystallinity etc and environmental effects of the microplastics liu et al 2019 su et al 2022 sun et al 2020 wu et al 2021 after natural aging the surface properties of the microfibers prepared from nylon ropes were changed tang et al 2020 moreover the adsorption capacity of microfibers to pb2 and perfluorooctane sulfonate was found to be enhanced after microbial aging bhagwat et al 2021 however as the most abundant shape of the microplastics the aging processes of the microfibers were rarely studied the already published studies related to microfibers mainly reported the existence of microfibers as the dominant microplastics in the environment and organisms ashjar et al 2023 yang et al 2021 yu et al 2023b only several studies analyzed the characteristics of the aged microfibers ropes and polylactic acid masks and their adsorption capacity to the other pollutants without the dynamic changes of microfibers in aging processes bhagwat et al 2021 tang et al 2020 yu et al 2023a moreover in view of the increasingly severe microfiber pollution exacerbated by the covid 19 it is very necessary to evaluate the changes and environmental impact of microfibers during weathering processes the aging characteristics of microplastics were examined through the application of many techniques bai et al 2022 bhagat et al 2022 chen et al 2021b such as fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps raman spectroscopy thermogravimetric analyzer tga etc these methods can analyze the changes in physical and chemical properties of the microplastics after weathering for example ftir and xps were selected to investigate the aging behaviors of polystyrene microplastics after fenton aging lang et al 2020 liu et al 2020 tga was used to analyze the thermal decomposition characteristics of polyethylene microplastics after xenon aging luo et al 2020 however even using these techniques many studies failed to combine the results to comprehensively discuss the relationship of data from different methods it was still a question that whether the techniques above were enough or closely related to give a full picture of the weathering processes some others quantified the aging characteristics by using some indices such as carbonyl index ci oxygen to carbon atom o c ratio contact angle etc chen et al 2021b liu et al 2019 however are these quantification indices correlated with each other and do they reflect the differences of various aging methods furthermore some studies investigated the effect of weathering on the interactions of microplastics with other pollutants by conducting adsorption desorption experiments bhagwat et al 2021 tang et al 2020 and found that weathering affected the adsorption desorption behavior of microplastics however is it possible to link the environmental behavior and the property variations in a quantitative way what s more until now most of the studies focused on the weathering of microplastics in shapes of granule or plate chen et al 2021b lang et al 2020 liu et al 2020 what differences can be expected on fiber shape microplastics to answer the questions above the disposable masks were selected representatively in this study disposable masks have become important sources of microfibers in the environment during the pandemic of the new coronavirus covid 19 mghili et al 2022 a hong kong based marine conservation organization reported that 1 56 billion masks were flowed into the ocean in 2020 oceansasia 2020 our recent study estimated that around 104 microfibers could be released from one disposable facemask into the environment under mechanical abrasion wu et al 2022 it was also found that microfibers were released from the masks into urban rivers together with the attachment of other environmental pollutants wang et al 2022 but there were still limited studies on face masks especially their aging behavior in this way taking the microfibers from face masks would be helpful to assess the fate of the fiber plastics in the environment therefore in this work microfibers were prepared from the face masks and pb2 was selected as a typical metal pollutant the weathering process was simulated by xenon aging and chemical aging and then subjected to pb2 adsorption to examine the effect of weathering processes the changes in fiber property and structure were detected in multiple dimensions by using a variety of characterization techniques the changes of aging indices such as contact angle carbonyl index o c ratio tm etc were analyzed and the ftir spectra were further evaluated by the two dimensional correlation analysis 2d cos the correlation analysis was performed to reveal the link between the aging indices and the environmental effects of microfibers principal component analysis pca was further conducted to disclose the different mechanisms of the two aging processes this study intended to give a full picture of the weathering processes of microfibers via multi dimensional investigation and to disclose the potential relationship between the aging characteristics and the environmental behavior of the microfibers 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample preparation and weathering a commercial surgical mask was purchased from the chinese domestic market and the outer layer of the mask was selected for this study the type of the outer layer was identified as polypropylene pp by attenuated total reflectance micro fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr μftir and then cut into small disks with a diameter of 5 mm potassium persulfate k2s2o8 and lead nitrate pb no3 2 were purchased from shanghai aladdin biochemical technology co ltd a xenon aging test chamber zhoxd 80p sailham equipment co ltd china was used to simulate the aging in full sunlight spectrum the kinetic aging experiment was performed separately and individually for different time intervals 2 4 6 and 20 days for each experiment 1 0 g of microfibers and 250 ml of milli q water were added to a glass petri dish and stirred well by a glass rod then the dish was placed in the aging chamber at 60 c under humidity of 80 and light irradiance of 1000 w m2 during weathering the samples were stirred regularly twice a day with a glass rod and the aged microfibers were obtained from every individual experiment after being washed and dried the pp microfibers were preserved and denoted as xen 2 4 6 20day for the following experiments meanwhile the chemical aging of thermal activated k2s2o8 was used to simulate the accelerated aging process the chemical aging treatment was performed similar to the xenon aging but with different time intervals 1 2 4 and 6 days in each treatment group 1 0 g of microfiber sample and 250 ml of k2s2o8 ph 7 0 0 1 mol l were mixed in a 500 ml glass conical flask and was then placed in a constant temperature oscillator for aging at 60 c with a speed of 180 rpm to ensure the persistence of the oxidant the aging solution was replaced by 250 ml of fresh k2s2o8 solution every 48 h each experiment group was conducted in duplicates the microfibers were aged following the above procedures and samples were recovered accordingly the collected microfibers were washed dried stored and denoted as oxi 1 2 4 6 day for the subsequent experiments 2 2 batch adsorption experiments 0 6 g of the aged microfibers were added into a 500 ml conical flask with 300 ml of pb2 solution ph 5 0 10 mg l and then the flask was shaken at 180 rpm and 25 c in a constant temperature oscillator for adsorption kinetics 2 ml of solution samples were taken at preset time intervals 5 min 10 min 20 min 30 min 1 h 2 h 4 h 8 h 13 h 24 h 36 h 48 h 60 h and was then filtered through a 0 45 μm glass fiber filter the experiments for adsorption isotherms were carried out following the same conditions as mentioned above but with pb2 concentrations of 5 10 15 20 and 25 mg l the outer layer of the original mask without weathering was used as a blank control group each experiment was repeated in duplicates the pseudo first order model and pseudo second order model were used to describe the adsorption kinetics while langmuir and freundlich isotherm equations were used for adsorption isotherms details in section 1 of the supporting information si 2 3 characterization and data analysis morphology of the microfibers was observed by scanning electron microscope sem merlin zeiss germany surface properties and molecular structure of the microfibers were examined by attenuated total reflectance micro fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr μftir nicolet in10 mx thermo fisher scientific usa x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps phi 5000 versaprobe ⅲ ulvac phi japan and confocal raman microscopy labram hr evolution horiba france furthermore the thermodynamic properties of the microfibers were detected using thermogravimetric analyzer tga setsys evo easy 1750 setaram france while the contact angles of the microfibers were measured using a drop shape analyzer dsa25b krüss germany at room temperature moreover the 2d cos analysis was conducted based on one dimensional ftir spectral data to explore the change order of the functional group of microfibers during weathering the area scan mode 8 μm 8 μm of confocal raman microscopy was used to record the intensity ratio of peaks at 841 and 808 cm 1 of the microfiber to detect the changes in the crystallization degree the correlation analysis and pca were also performed to further understand the aging mechanisms of microfibers all statistical analyses were performed using origin 2021 or spss 22 0 software an effect with p 0 05 was considered significant the details for the above characterizations were provided in section i of the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 observable changes in morphology and properties 3 1 1 morphology evolution as demonstrated in fig 1 a the surface of the pristine pp microfiber surface was relatively smooth with a diameter of about 20 μm after chemical aging for 1 day the holes appeared on the fiber surface fig 1 b while cracking was observed after 2 days fig 1 c with nanoplastics generated and adhered on the fiber surface fig s1 a of si with prolonged aging time the cracks of the microfibers became much denser deeper and wider fig 1 b e and finally the microfibers were completely fractured into granular form after 7 days fig s1 b of si therefore further experiments on the chemically aged microfibers were conducted based on the aging processes within 6 days meanwhile in the xenon aging process fig 1 f i rough surface was observed for the aged pp microfibers with the formation of bumps and some specific textures were observed after aging for 20 days but without cracks overall the changes in microfiber morphology were different when subjected to different aging processes xenon or chemical aging the morphology changes were more observable for the chemically aged pp microfibers than those after xenon aging indicating much more serious impact caused by chemical aging processes the cracked and wrinkled surface of the pp microfibers was similar to the phenomenon observed for the aged textiles schellenberger et al 2022 3 1 2 functional group evolution fig 1 j collated the ftir spectra of microfibers before and after aging and table s1 summarized the spectral assignments of the ftir bands the absorption peaks of 2700 3000 cm 1 were mainly attributed to the stretching vibration of c h in ch3 and ch2 while the bending vibrations of c h mainly affected the absorption peaks at 1300 1475 1166 972 and 997 cm 1 furthermore after aging new carbonyl peaks from 1660 to 1800 cm 1 were detected which belonged to the stretching vibration of carbonyl c o lactone ester ketone carboxylic acid etc the maximum absorbance peak of the carbonyl was observed at 1708 cm 1 and 1726 cm 1 for samples after chemical and xenon aging respectively and the intensity was increased gradually with prolonged aging time fig s2 of si this phenomenon indicates that chemical changes occurred during weathering resulting in the breaking of the c c bonds and the formation of c o functional groups chen et al 2021b resmeriță et al 2018 the intensity of the carbonyl peak of the microfibers after chemical aging was much higher than that after xenon aging suggesting faster and stronger damage under chemical aging raman spectroscopy was sensitive to the changes in the chain conformation of polymer and it was usually used to study the regularity and local structure of polymers shrestha et al 2018 therefore in this study the changes in the chemical structure of microfibers were probed using a confocal raman microscopy with spectra demonstrated in fig 1 k and vibrational assignment summarized in table s1 of si the peak at 973 cm 1 was mainly associated with asymmetrical stretching of the axial c c bond and that at 998 cm 1 was related to the rocking of the methyl ch3 lateral group with aging processes proceeding the intensity of the peak at 973 cm 1 was decreased gradually while that at 998 cm 1 was increased slowly the results indicated that the asymmetric stretching vibration of the c c bond of the fiber was weakened during weathering but the lateral ch3 rocking was enhanced furthermore the peak at 1168 cm 1 was originated from the tensile and swing vibration of c c and its intensity was decreased gradually and showed a blue shifting showing the weakening of the tensile and oscillatory vibrations of c c with aging processes based on the peak changes above it can be inferred that the c c bond was broken to form ch3 which further indicated the damage of long pp chain caused by aging in addition the peak at 1530 cm 1 was due to the vibration of the c n c bridge bonds of the phthalocyanine macrocycle a structure belonging to copper phthalocyanine shaibat et al 2010 tackley et al 2001 usually used as an organic pigment the peak was declined significantly for chemical aging samples attributed to the worse color fading of this aging method fig s1 b of si 3 2 deeper analysis in structural changes by raman mapping and 2d ftir cos 3 2 1 structural changes by raman mapping pp is a semi crystalline polymer the results of one dimensional raman spectroscopy fig 1 k showed that the raman peaks at 808 and 841 cm 1 were correlated to the helical chain of the crystal region and the short helical segment with isomeric defects respectively the intensity ratio of the two peaks i841 808 was used to assess the changes in the crystallinity and conformation of pp microfibers after aging nielsen et al 2002 yan et al 2021 therefore the two dimensional raman spectroscopy raman mapping test was further performed an area 8 μm 8 μm of microfiber was arbitrarily selected and then the intensity ratio of the peaks at 841 and 808 cm 1 i841 808 in this area was detected by the area scan mode of confocal raman microscopy the mapping results in fig 2 a illustrated that the i841 808 value was increased gradually as aging progressed in aging processes the isomeric defects were introduced into the trans gauche conformation and the c c coupling was partially lost as a result nielsen et al 2002 the side group mode of ch2 rocking became the main contributor to the potential energy distribution for 841 cm 1 band causing a shift of raman band from 808 to 841 cm 1 moreover the introduction of isomeric defects reduced the crystallinity of the microfibers therefore the i841 808 value of fibers was increased with prolonged aging time as demonstrated in fig 2 a furthermore a greater increase in i841 808 value was observed for fibers after chemical aging from 0 399 0 0104 to 1 124 0 0191 compared to xenon aging from 0 399 0 0104 to 0 905 0 0193 indicating the stronger effect of the chemical aging in addition the i841 808 value after 4 days of chemical aging was comparable to the value after 20 days of xenon aging showing a faster aging process by chemical oxidation 3 2 2 potential sequence of changes in functional groups by 2d ftir cos the 2d cos analysis was carried out based on one dimensional ftir spectral data within the range of 900 1900 cm 1 the synchronous maps in fig 2 b c demonstrated very different peak distribution between the two aging conditions in xenon aging fig 2 b three peaks at 972 cm 1 ch 1376 cm 1 ch3 and 1726 cm 1 c o on the diagonal line were auto peaks but the synchronous correlation intensity was low suggesting that these bands were slightly sensitive to the disturbances caused by aging moreover the cross peaks in the synchronization diagram were positive implying the same direction of the changes in peak intensity in chemical aging fig 2 c an auto peak was observed at 1708 cm 1 c o along the diagonal line with significantly higher intensity than those of the xenon aging showing that the microfibers were more sensitive to chemical oxidization moreover a negative cross peak at φ 972 1708 indicated the opposite direction of the two bands at 972 and 1708 cm 1 asynchronous mapping fig 2 b c is about diagonal antisymmetric with no auto peaks but only cross peaks at off diagonal positions ding et al 2020 different asynchronous maps were observed when the 2d cos maps were compared between the two aging processes fig 2 b c the map of xenon aging samples was found with negative cross peaks of ψ 972 997 1166 1708 ψ 997 1708 ψ 1166 1708 and positive cross peaks ψ 997 1166 meanwhile the map of chemical aging presented six positive cross peaks at ψ 972 1376 1455 1726 ψ 1376 1455 1726 and ψ 1455 1726 based on noda s rules noda 1993 combining synchronous and asynchronous correlation spectroscopy can reveal the change order of specific chemical bonds during aging therefore the subsequent results were summarized in table s2 and s3 of si showing the assignment and sign of each cross peak in the synchronous and asynchronous maps of microfibers after aging the aging sequence of the microfibers in xenon aging was as follows 972 cm 1 ch symmetric bending 1708 cm 1 c o vibration 997 cm 1 ch asymmetric bending 1166 cm 1 ch3 bending while in chemical aging processes the order of functional groups involved was 972 cm 1 ch symmetric bending 1376 cm 1 ch3 bending 1726 cm 1 c o vibration to summarize the functional group of ch symmetric bending changed at first and was followed by the c o vibration the sequence indicated that the ch groups on the carbon chain were more likely to be oxidized to c o groups in the aging process and more carbonyl groups were produced in chemical aging processes due to bond scission by sufficient so4 radicals in addition there were c o peaks rather than c c peaks observed in both raman and ftir spectra showing that the c o groups were preferentially formed when the c c bond of pp was broken combining the results of 2d ftir cos and raman spectroscopy and other studies about the main routes and oxidation products of pp degradation kirkbride and norrish 1931 rajakumar et al 2009 the aging mechanisms for the formation of carbonyl c o in pp microfibers can be illustrated by the reaction pathways in fig 2 d when pp microfibers were weathered under photo oxidation or advanced oxidation the c h bonds preferably tertiary hydrogen in the polymer backbone were susceptible to be attacked by the reactive oxygen radicals this reaction led to the breaking of the c h bond triggering a free radical chain reaction in the polymer and further generating alkyl radicals the alkyl radicals combined with oxygen to form the alkoxy radicals which subsequently reacted with polymer backbone to form the carbonyl groups c o based on previous reports stark and matuana 2004 the c o generated may continue to degrade via the norrish reaction if the c o was degraded according to the norrish i reaction the resulting free radicals can attack the pp material which may cause termination through cross linking or chain scission if the degradation was followed by the norrish ii reaction carbonyl groups and terminal vinyl groups were formed and the chain scission occurred specially although c o were produced ultimately by pp microfibers under both xenon aging and chemical aging the reaction processes under the two aging methods were inconsistent xenon aging belongs to photodegradation triggered by simulated natural light while chemical aging is oxidative degradation triggered by so4 generated by thermally activated k2s2o8 johnson et al 2008 ftir results also confirmed the inconsistent reaction process fig 1 j the maximum absorption peaks of the generated c o usually composed of aldehydes ketones etc were observed at 1726 cm 1 and 1708 cm 1 for samples after xenon and chemical aging respectively the different position of peaks indicated the different components of c o and the unlike reaction processes under the two aging methods 3 3 changes in adsorption behavior of microfibers elucidated by pb2 pb2 was selected representatively to evaluate the interference of aging process on the interactions of pp microfibers and other pollutant in the environment fig 3 illustrated the fitting results of pb2 adsorption on the raw and aged microfibers and the parameters of the adsorption kinetics models were listed in table s4 of si in fig 3 a c pb2 was adsorbed rapidly onto the microfibers at the first 1 h and then slowed down with prolonged time until reaching equilibrium at about 8 h when comparing the adsorption kinetics of microfibers aged at different time it can be found that the pb2 adsorption can be well fitted by both pseudo first order fig 3 a c and pseudo second order models fig s5 a c of si at the initial stage of aging both chemical aging and xenon aging however with the aging time extending the adsorption process was fitted much better by the pseudo second order model the phenomenon indicated that the pb2 adsorption on the pristine microfibers may be physisorption but chemical interaction gradually dominated as aging progressed overall the adsorption kinetics were fitted better to the pseudo second order model for the aged fibers suggesting that the chemical adsorption became the rate limiting step of pb2 adsorption with continuous aging processes furthermore the fitting results of adsorption isotherms were shown in fig 3 b d with parameters given in table s5 of si the nonlinear adsorption of pb2 was observed over the entire concentration range indicating the heterogeneity of adsorption sites on the microfiber surface shen et al 2021 tang et al 2020 however the correlation coefficient values obtained from the langmuir model were better than that of the freundlich model fig s5 b d of si implying that the adsorption of pb2 on microfibers may be monolayer adsorption moreover the maximum adsorption capacity qmax of pb2 was increased with the enhanced aging effect fig 3 with the value from 0 342 mg g of the original fiber to 1 335 mg g and 0 792 mg g respectively after chemical 6 days and xenon aging 20 days for the original pp microfibers their surface charge was negative at ph 5 0 and thus electrostatic interaction was the major mechanism for attachment of the positively charged pb2 meanwhile the aging process changed the physicochemical properties of the microfibers as indicated by the changes of ci values and o c ratio fig 4 then the oxygen containing functional groups were involved in complexation or chelation with the pb2 rather than physisorption lesmana et al 2009 tang et al 2020 which enhanced the affinity of microfibers to pb2 therefore both adsorption kinetics and isotherms indicated that the aging process enhanced the binding capacity of pb2 to microfibers a stronger effect was observed by chemical aging compared to xenon aging which was due to greater variation in surface oxygen containing functional groups contact angle and the conformation of polypropylene helical chains etc to further clarify the adsorption process of pb2 on pp microfibers the weber morris model was used to fit the kinetic process fig 3 e with parameters summarized in table s6 of si the adsorption process of pb2 on the pristine fiber can be divided into two stages the intercept of the fitting line for the first stage was close to the origin indicating that the rate of the adsorption was mainly limited by the intraparticle diffusion however the adsorption process of the aged fiber can be divided into three stages rapid adsorption stage transition stage and quasi equilibrium stage the fitting lines of the aged fibers did not cross the origin meaning that the rate controlling step was not intraparticle diffusion alone moreover the intercept values of the aged fiber in the three adsorption stages were larger than those of the pristine pp microfibers table s6 of si which was mainly attributed to the increase in adsorption sites on the surface of the aged fiber resulting in enhanced mass transfer driving force for pb2 diffusion inside the pp microfibers 3 4 correlation between critical aging indices and environmental behaviors 3 4 1 quantitative indices hydrophilicity related contact angle was highly affected by surface functional groups of the polymers chen et al 2021b which can be used to evaluate the changes of fiber surface during aging quantitatively the microfiber prepared from the outer layer of the surgical masks was extremely hydrophobic with contact angle of 133 3 0 69 and the contact angle was decreased to 126 8 2 80 and 124 0 0 98 after xenon and chemical aging respectively fig 4 a e the slight decrease in the contact angle indicated that the hydrophobicity of microfibers was decreased during weathering which was due to the formation of oxygen containing functional groups on fiber surface resmeriță et al 2018 however even after aging processes the fiber surface was still highly hydrophobic furthermore the ci value is always regarded as an important indicator to quantify the aging degree of the plastics liu et al 2019 it refers to the relative abundance of the carbonyl groups and is calculated as the ratio of the maximum intensity of the carbonyl peak 1660 1800 cm 1 to that of the reference peak of the ftir spectra wu et al 2021 the peak at 2917 cm 1 is stable and characteristic for the pp polymer brandon et al 2016 and thus it was chosen as the reference peak after calculation the ci value was illustrated in fig 4 b f showing that the ci of the fiber was increased from the original value 0 020 0 0014 to 0 063 0 0060 and 0 263 0 0050 after xenon and chemical aging respectively a higher ci value after chemical aging further indicated a stronger weathering effect in chemical aging than xenon aging moreover the o c ratio was calculated based on the area proportion of o 1 s and c 1 s peaks of the xps spectra fig s3 of si and the results were summarized in fig 4 c g generally speaking the o c ratio was amplified with the aging processes going on in xenon aging the ratio was increased gradually from 0 037 0 0057 to 0 103 0 0021 on the 20th day suggesting the continuous formation of some oxygen containing groups meanwhile in chemical aging the ratio grew significantly to 0 133 0 0028 even after aging for 2 days and then kept relatively stable at 0 133 0 142 at the beginning of the chemical aging the surface of the microfiber was oxidized quickly and strongly resulting in a dramatic increase in the o c ratio however as the aging proceeded the available sites for oxidation reactions were limited without obvious amplification in the o c ratio in addition the changes in temperatures for thermal decomposition of the microfibers can be another quantitative evaluation on aging characteristics fig 4 d h showed the thermogravimetric curve of the microfibers before and after different aging processes after xenon aging the microfibers were decomposed at 390 495 c fig 4 d while the temperature at the maximum weight loss rate tm remained constantly at 465 469 c fig s4 a of si however the microfibers after chemical aging was mainly decomposed at 362 492 c together with a slight decomposition at 160 330 c fig 5 h and the tm was decreased to 452 6 c after aging 6 days fig s4 b of si the mass loss rate of microfibers was ranging from 4 to 6 when the chemical aging time was from 2 to 6 days compared with the original fiber and the fiber after xenon aging the obvious changes in thermal behavior after chemical aging were attributed to the decomposition of short chain molecules generated due to chemical oxidation 3 4 2 correlation analysis fig 5 a summarized the correlation of ci value with prolonged aging time showing a linear correlation for both chemical r2 0 980 and xenon r2 0 768 aging however the o c ratio versus aging time fig 5 b illustrated a significant correlation well described by exponential equations r2 0 999 and 0 967 for chemical and xenon aging respectively with different alteration rates observed throughout the entire processes as aging progressed the trend of ci value was different from that of o c ratio which might be due to the different penetration depths of the atr μftir and xps technique bhagat et al 2022 atr μftir allows for a micrometer thick surface analysis while xps probes the nanometer depth the aging of pp microfibers was started from the surface and a longer time was usually needed for the interior oxidation of the polymer in the early aging stage the gradual increase of oxygen containing functional groups on the fiber surface led to a linear relationship between o c ratio and ci value with the aging time with increase in the aging degree the structural change of the microfibers would be transferred from the surface to the interior however as a non contact spectral analysis technology xps is only suitable for surface analysis at nanometer depth and not conducive to reflect the changes below the nanometer surface layer causing a plateauing of the o c ratio in the later aging stages in contrast atr μftir is a contact type measurement method suitable for detecting surface changes at micrometer thickness which can reflect the changes below the nanoscale surface layer of the microfibers as a result the ci value from the atr μftir was still increasing with the enhanced aging degree overall in processes with slight aging effect like xenon aging in this study which simulated the natural aging condition the o c ratio was better to reflect the changes in surface properties of the microfibers meanwhile for the artificial accelerated aging like the chemical aging in this study atr μftir measurement ci value was more suitable for probing samples with more severe weathering phenomena furthermore to evaluate the relationship between the aging characteristics and the environmental behavior of microfibers a correlation analysis was conducted between the maximum pb2 adsorption capacity qmax and the quantitative indices contact angle ci o c i841 808 and tm the results in fig 5 c showed that the contact angle ci o c and i841 808 were significantly correlated with each other indicating that the changes of oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of pp microfibers during aging were significantly correlated with the changes of crystallization degree and conformation this is mainly attributed to the destruction of the chemical structure of the microfibers by aging when cross compared qmax was positively related to ci o c and i841 808 but negatively related to the contact angle and tm this showed that the increase of oxygen containing functional groups and the decrease of crystallization degree of pp microfibers during aging would lead to the increase of pb2 adsorption capacity and the decrease of hydrophobicity and maximum weight loss rate temperature tm would also enhance the pb2 adsorption capacity of pp microfibers ding et al ding et al 2020 also found that the decrease of hydrophobicity and the increase of oxygen containing functional groups on the surface of ps microplastics after aging were the main factors leading to the increase of their adsorption capacity for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs overall the correlation results certified that when microfibers are subjected to photodegradation and oxidative degradation during aging their physicochemical properties oxygen containing functional groups hydrophobicity degree of crystallinity etc will be changed and these changes can have a significant impact on the ability of microfibers to adsorb contaminants in addition this means that in future studies researchers may be able to predict the environmental behavior of microplastics by monitoring changes in their aging indices in addition the pca results fig 5 d also pointed out that the characteristics of microfibers were completely separated under both aging processes indicating the significant differences in the aging behavior of microfibers 3 5 environmental implications many evidences demonstrated unequivocally that microfibers were accumulated widespread in aquatic environments browne et al 2011 taylor et al 2016 woodall et al 2014 face masks were reported as an emerging source of microfibers in the era of the covid 19 wang et al 2022 wu et al 2022 together with other common sources such as fabric geotextiles fishing nets etc after releasing into the environment the microfibers will undergo weathering processes afterwards resulting in alterations in their properties and environmental effects for the first time this study combined multi dimensional assessment methods to deeply understand the aging processes of the microfibers from the face masks also correlated the aging characteristics and environmental behavior of microfibers through a variety of newly developed quantitative indices it implied that the subsequent environmental behavior of the aged microfibers may be predicted based on the characteristic indices of the aging processes which would be an interesting point for researchers to assess the environmental risks of the microplastics during weathering processes in natural environment moreover the findings of the suitability of quantitative indices for different aging processes would also shed new sights on future studies about the aging evaluation of the microplastics in addition the results of the microfibers from face masks could help policymakers formulate regulations on the management and disposal of disposable masks especially in the epidemic era 4 conclusion this study combined multi dimensional assessment methods to deeply understand the weathering process of the microfibers from the face masks through simulated xenon and chemical aging besides observable changes in morphologies via techniques such as sem atr μftir and confocal raman microscopy we further explored structure evolutions by adopting raman mapping and 2d ftir cos furthermore the changes in the adsorption capacity of microfibers to pb2 during weathering was investigated the results showed that microfibers could serve as an effective carrier for pb2 transport in aquatic environment and the binding capacity of pb2 to microfibers was enhanced gradually during weathering compared with xenon aging chemical aging had a greater effect on this binding capacity in addition we quantified the aging characteristics and environmental behavior by a variety of indices contact angle ci o c i841 808 tm and qmax and discussed their correlation with each other the correlation analysis showed that the affinity of the microfibers to pb2 qmax was positively related to ci o c and i841 808 but negatively correlated to contact angle and tm pca results pointed out significantly different aging behavior of the microfibers under chemical and xenon aging conditions the o c ratio was more suitable to quantify the surface changes with lower aging degree while the ci value explained the chemical aging process better overall this study provided a comprehensive understanding on the weathering process of microfibers via multi dimensional investigation and disclosed the potential relationship between the aging characteristics and the environmental behavior which favored to assess the environmental behaviors and risks of microfibers in natural and complicated conditions author information jiangpeng li conducted the entire

establishment and changes in microplastic associated biofilm and amr during a conventional full scale 2100 population equivalent wastewater treatment process combined with a free water surface polishing constructed wetland sequential microplastic colonization experiments were conducted at different stages of the wastewater treatment process including in raw sewage treated effluent and the constructed wetland two scenarios were tested in which the constructed wetland served as either i a polishing step or ii as primary recipient of sewage inoculated microplastics bacterial 16s rrna gene sequencing was carried out for qualitative bacterial community analysis qpcr was applied for quantitative analysis of amr genes sul1 ermb tetw intii1 bacterial biomass 16s rrna and a human fecal

constructed wetland pathogen and amr load decreased by up to two orders of magnitude after coupled conventional and constructed wetland treatment while less impact was observed when sewage inoculated microplastic material was directly transferred into the constructed wetland aeromonas klebsiella and streptococcus were key pathogenic genera correlated with amr in microplastic associated biofilms despite decreasing trends on human pathogens and amr load along the treatment process microplastic associated biofilms were a considerable potential hotspot for amr inti1 gene and accommodated

to human health revel et al 2018 amr is among the top ten global public health problems there are more fatalities caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria than by hiv or malaria murray et al 2022 despite different origins and characteristics mp pollution and amr spread share similar environmental dispersion routes both mps and amr bacteria occur simultaneously in wastewater while wastewater treatment plants wwtps are hubs for both contaminants pazda et al 2019 ziajahromi et al 2017 along sewage and wastewater treatment mps are colonized by microbial biofilms mccormick et al 2014 including bacteria populations with high relative amr gene abundance lai et al 2022 especially in antibiotic rich wastewater berglund 2015 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are not specifically designed for complete mps or amr removal attenuation of mps by wwtps depends on treatment stage and technology ranging from 50 for basic secondary treatment towards 99 for advanced tertiary treatment blair et al 2019 raju et al 2020 talvitie et al 2017 despite high mps removal 95 achieved in large municipal wwtps conley et al 2019 kim et al 2022 the estimated release of mp via wwtps for example in

as ozonation or membrane filtration may lead to 4 log 99 99 removal hiller et al 2019 wang and chen 2020 however wwtp effluent can still reach 104 amr gene copies gc ml 1 for the most prevalent amr

parde et al 2021 mps removal in cw from wastewater streams varies widely between 20 and 95 wang et al 2020 wei et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 amr removal in cws is comparable to conventional wwtps ma et al 2022 few studies have investigated biofilm growth on mps and related pathogen and amr spread in sewage and wwtps mps collected from wwtp effluent have a distinctively different bacterial community

spread of pathogens oberbeckmann et al 2018 proia et al 2016 moreover disinfection had little effect on microplastic associated biofilm composition and their ability to accommodate intact amr galafassi et al 2021 shen et al 2021 yang et al 2022 in summary there is strong evidence on the possible risk of increased amr spread through mps released by wwtps studies investigating mps biofilm

al 2022 martínez campos et al 2021 yang et al 2022 or laboratory studies eckert et al 2018 wang et al 2021 wu et al 2019 few field studies were carried out and none investigated time dependent colonization dynamics galafassi et al 2021 kelly et al 2021 or the role of cw systems in mitigating mp associated pathogen and amr hazard the aim of this study was to address this knowledge gap by looking at the combined effect of colonization time and treatment step dependent dynamics of mps associated amr and pathogens in wastewater colonization and amr evolution patterns on sterile mps were studied including how these patterns change along different stages of a conventional wastewater treatment process combined with a polishing cw downstream treatment of wastewater effluent via a polishing cw may alter mps biofilm composition and amr levels and minimize the synergy of mps pollution and amr spread beyond simple physical mps retention to test this hypothesis batches of sterile microplastics were successively incubated and transferred between different stages of a full scale treatment process equipped with a cw at varying incubation times and genetically analyzed this is the first mps sequential colonization experiment that provides both temporal and spatial analysis of mp biofilm alteration during a full scale wastewater treatment process additionally incorporating a cw

combined sewerage from a rural catchment with a pollution load of 2100 population equivalent pe cromhall wrc consists of sewage treatment works stw providing secondary treatment oxidation ditch and surface flow constructed wetlands acting as a polishing step fig 1 a the stw has operated since 1980s the cw operation was added in 2020 for enhanced phosphorus removal stw effluent and cw water quality data are available in supplementary data table 1s due to covid pandemic related restrictions in 2021 water quality monitoring of stw inflow raw wastewater was not possible cromhall cw has a surface of 0 8 ha and consists of 12 treatment cells of variable size depth and vegetation cover table s2 plant composition is dominated by the emergent macrophytes schoenoplectus lacustris and typha angustifolia open water zones are covered primarily with duck weed and low growing apium nodiflorum 2 2 experimental design the colonization experiment used four types of plastics including high density polyethylene hdpe polyvinyl chloride pvc polyethylene terephthalate pet and polystyrene ps fig s1a which represent major polymer types present in municipal wastewater including diversity of plastics physicochemical properties affecting biofilm formation azizi et al 2022 xu et al 2021 microplastics were produced via freeze grinding of commercial plasticware made from the selected polymers as indicated by the composition label produced microplastics were sieved to obtain a uniform specimen range of 0 50 0 75 mm approximately 400 mg of each polymer type was prepared in triplicates and each mp type loaded into separate stainless steel mesh tea infusers fig s1b and sterilized in an autoclave loaded infusers were attached to a steel chain and additionally wrapped into a coarse mesh bag to prevent accidental loss of samples infusers containing mps were transferred alongside the wastewater treatment process at three locations fig 1a to simulate successive transport and sequential colonization of mps through the wastewater treatment system fig s2 a d throughout the manuscript sampling locations are denoted as follows wwtp inflow point containing raw sewage rww effluent from secondary clarifier comprising of a final effluent from the wwtp sce treatment cell 6 at the cw cw three separate colonization experiments indicated with indexes 1 2 and 3 respectively were carried out simulating different travel routes of mps fig 1b colonization experiment 1 was based on successive transition of mps from sewage rww mps incubation point through the conventional wastewater treatment process sce followed by the polishing cw experiment 2 simulated a case when cw acts as primary recipient of wastewater by transferring mps directly from raw sewage rww into the cw while bypassing the secondary treatment step in experiment 3 sterile mps were deployed into cw as a quasi control to assess independently the effect of cw microbial community on mps colonization without sewage pre inoculation the study was carried out in a period of stable summer weather conditions july september 2021 without prolonged dry periods or heavy rain events reflected by water flow readings fig s3 each experiment was carried out at two colonization incubation times of 4 days and 20 days the selected incubation times were chosen to simulate short 4d and long 20d retention times applicable to mps in both conventional wwtp and cws while providing enough time span to ensure visible temporal shift in colonization patterns in conventional wwtps mps retention often correlates with suspended frehland et al 2020 solids retention time srt which varies between few days up 20 d and beyond depending on the treatment process vieno and sillanpää 2014 for cws use of hrt instead of srt to determine mps retention might be more adequate bydalek at al 2023 for the cw system studied here hrt ranges between 2d and 15d depending on the weather conditions and was typically 5 10 days during the study period the experimental timeline is shown in fig 1b the applied timeline synchronized mps deployment in the cw rather than in sewage rww to accommodate for more pronounced temperature fluctuation in the cw while also considering the relatively stable composition of municipal wastewater mps were first deployed into raw wastewater at the inflow of the wwtp rww following selected incubation times at each location mps were removed from infusers and washed with sterilized deionized water subsequently 100 mg mps from each infuser were transferred into separate 2 ml sterile centrifuge tubes and stored at 20 c until the further processing the remaining mps were transferred into new sterile infusers and then deployed into the next location mps of the four polymer types were incubated in separate infusers during the in situ colonization phases but were pooled together for the dna extraction to create an equal weight composite sample consisting of all 4 polymer types note that polymer type may affect colonization patterns on mps ramsperger et al 2020 tu et al 2021 we decided on pooled analysis of a representative plastics mixture in wwtps due to analytical cost considerations safety regulations did not allow deployment of infusers into the oxidation ditch and secondary clarifier instead infusers were placed in the wwtp final effluent chamber receiving wastewater from secondary clarifier sce cw treatment cell 6 served as a deployment site for mps due to its well established vegetation cover and position in the middle of the cw in the cw infusers were attached to a foam floater and submerged approximately 5 10 cm below water surface fig s2 d direct dispersion of mps onto the water surface was also considered but turned out unfeasible due a large wildfowl population dwelling in the cw over the study period additional water samples were collected to provide information on planktonic fraction of the microbial community background each sampling site was subsampled 3 times a day at 1000 ml sample size subsamples were later combined into a quasi daily composite sample a total of 3 quasi daily composites were collected for the sce secondary clarifier effluent and cw treatment cell tc6 each while the raw sewage rww was collected only once due to sampling restriction imposed by the covid pandemic water samples were immediately

per sample to normalize all samples to a same sequencing depth the applied rarefaction depth led to exclude one sample due to low number of reads 10000 post processing taxonomic coverage reached a minimum of 0 9893 of original taxonomic coverage thus data pre processing led to a loss of a maximum ca 1 of taxonomic information to assess pathogen dynamics taxonomic composition was screened for presence of pathogenic genera and species representing priority pathogens established by the who asokan et al 2019 2 4 2 statistical analysis microbial diversity indices including chao1 richness and shannon and simpson community diversity were calculated using phyloseq package v 1 38 0 in r software v 4 1 3 and q2 diversity plugin in qiime2 pipeline chao1 index quantifies total number of species

extracted from a total of 34 mp samples and seven quasi daily composite water samples collected at three different steps for the wastewater treatment process and at two different incubation times mps only sequencing revealed the presence of a total of 4690 taxa across all samples showing spatial and temporal gradients of taxonomic diversity after successive inoculation at different wastewater treatment stages table s4 in experiments 1 and 2 mps inoculated in sewage developed the least diverse microbial communities shannon chao1 indicating biofilm maturation with increasing diversity at longer incubation time the highest community diversity was observed for mps inoculated for 20 days in secondary clarifier effluent sce and the cw respectively which carried over already established biofilms from previous treatment stages cw water samples showed a much lower diversity shannon 3 35 than the biofilm developed on mps in the cw shannon 4 44 5 78 during experiment 3 table s4 possibly due to the low suspended solids concentration and turbidity in the water column table s1 in the same environment the free floating bacterial community is typically less diverse than particle associated assemblages forming the biofilm liu et al 2019 savio et al 2015 biofilm communities on mps in experiments 1 and 2 formed distinctive groups reflecting spatial and temporal diversity as visualized by an unweighted unifrac pcoa plot fig 2 in experiment 1 fig 2a the 20 day grown biofilm showed close similarities with planktonic communities present at rww and sce while cw mps showed closer similarities to sce biofilm than cw planktonic composition for 4 d incubation qualitative similarities between raw sewage sce and cw were apparent after a combined retention of 8 d in sce and cw mps carried raw wastewater derived microbial community with little alteration caused by the respective treatment process in experiment 2 fig 2b biofilm composition comprised 2 groups separating cw and rww results the overall distribution of data points on the pcoa plot may indicate biofilm evolution in the sce forced aeration in wastewater treatment provides different aerobic anaerobic metabolic niches in a high nutrient environment supporting diverse consortia development cao et al 2017 de kreuk et al 2005 wilén and balmér 1999 our data show that some of the original sewage microbial community is preserved on the 4 day incubated mps however biofilm communities that developed initially on mps immersed in sewage are less adaptable when transferred directly into the cw as indicated by the dissimilarities shown on the pcoa plain fig 2b this is probably due to fast transition from a nutrient rich low oxygen environment rww into an environment with higher oxygen concentrations and fewer readily available nutrients cw ghattas et al 2017 santos soares et al 2022 despite indications of potential biofilm preservation each treatment step left a unique footprint on a microbial community on the mps as shown by constrained analysis of principal component cap text s2 2 which was used to assess the impact of experimental design variables on the microbial community composition cap showed the combined effect of incubation time and location treatment step which explained 83 5 and 79 8 of community composition variability for experiment 1 and experiment 2 respectively 3 2 microplastic associated biofilm community composition proteobacteria emerged as primary colonizers of mps making up ca 90 of the biofilm community composition after 4 d contact time with raw sewage rww fig 3 with increasing incubation time 20 d relative abundance of protobacteria decreased to 60 with distinct changes in major proteobacterial families moraxellaceae and campylobacteraceae were dominant 65 after 4 d incubation while 20 d incubation shifted proteobacterial representation towards comamonadaceae and rhodocyclaceae 60 figs s4 and 5 proteobacteria represent a wide range of different types of metabolism and have been observed as key biofilm forming microbial taxa on mps in various environments guo et al 2022 lee et al 2008 miao et al 2019 that includes also known plastic degrading species as discussed in more detail in supplementary material text s1 fig s8 the raw wastewater inoculated biofilm showed a significant increase in gram positive bacteria after 20 d representing firmicutes 16 7 and actinobacteria 2 3 subsequent incubation of mps at sce for 4 d did not affect the phylum level diversity but showed a significant decrease of campylobacteraceae 5 and emergence of pseudomonadaceae 15 8 the taxonomic shift observed after 20 d in sce was more pronounced and resulted in acquisition of planctomycetes 22 7 chloroflexi 9 0 and acidobacteria 6 9 planctomycetes chloroflexi and acidobacteria are key phyla in biological wastewater treatment including within oxidation ditches as studied here zhang et al 2019 planctomycetes comprised mainly of pirellulaceae 37 and planctomycetaceae 36 which include known ammonia oxidizers critical also in the annamox process dos santos et al 2021 filamentous chloroflexi were represented by the a4b family 36 chloroflexi form and stabilize microbial flocks in activated sludge while acidobacteria species largely contribute to phosphorus and nitrogen removal processes kristensen et al 2021 nierychlo et al 2019 mps transferred from wwtp into the cw experiment 1 showed minor community shifts with acquisition of verrucomicrobiaceae and photoautotrophic rhodobacteraceae both families are widely found in sediments of wetland ecosystems ansola et al 2014 indicating population exchange and migration between wetland sediment and planktonic communities direct transfer of mps from rww into the cw experiment 2 manifested in shifts in the anaerobic population this included obligate anaerobic firmicutes veillonellaceae fusibacter anaerovorax trichococus replaced by planctomycetes and bacteroidetes fig 3 proteobacteria 75 90 of population were maintained irrespective of the incubation time and unlike to experiment 1 where the proteobacteria decreased sharply 85 to 34 family comamonadaceae showed to be most adapted to cw environment almost doubling its relative abundance ca 30 irrespective the incubation time at direct deployment of mps into the cw experiment 3 biofilms after 4 d were initially dominated by proteobacteria and bacteroidetes 92 2 total after 20 d the community also comprised of planctomycetes 13 7 verrucomicrobia 10 1 chloroflexi 1 8 and acidobacteria 2 1 mps also carried cyanobacteria 1 8 2 1 presumably due to algal blooms observed in the cw fig s7 algal blooms are a common operational problem of cws often indicating hydraulic mismanagement i e stagnant water zones or lack of adequate plant shading healy and cawley 2002 mps harboring cyanobacteria may facilitate spread of undesired algal blooms in downstream freshwater ecosystems curren and leong 2020 the planktonic community was dominated by bacteroidetes with significantly p 0 05 lower abundance of proteobacteria fig 3 the raw wastewater planktonic community was dominated by four bacterial families lachnospiraceae 23 8 ruminococcaceae 13 9 comamonadaceae 13 7 and prevotellaceae 11 9 fig s6 water samples collected from wwtp effluent were diverse with appreciable population of comamonadaceae 7 8 flavobacteriaceae 4 8 procabacteriaceae 4 8 pirellulaceae 4 and moraxellaceae 3 4 and 40 different families contributing 1 2 to community composition the diversity of clarifier effluent sce was in sharp contrast to the cw community composition where flavobacteriaceae and comamonadaceae comprised 75 of community composition and ten bacterial families 1 relative abundance fig s6 3 3 fate of pathogens in microplastic associated biofilms mps in raw sewage were colonized by up to 25 in relative abundance by genera comprising antimicrobial resistant eskape pathogens enterococcus faecium staphylococcus aureus klebsiella pneumoniae acinetobacter baumannii pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter species de oliveira et al 2020 lai et al 2022 some who list priority pathogens neisseria campylobacter and aeromonas were also found fig 4 the overall relative abundance of pathogenic genera was highest for mps incubated in raw wastewater transition of mps through wastewater treatment stages led to a steady decrease of this potentially pathogenic population at 20 d incubation relative abundance of acinetobacter species decreased over 2 orders of magnitude at sce and cw passage fig 4 and a 5 10 fold decrease of relative abundance of klebsiella species the observed loss of klebsiella contrasts a study reporting high survival on mps in wwtps kelly et al 2021 compared to planktonic bacterial communities mps biofilm had a 1 2 orders of magnitude higher relative abundance of pathogens fig 4 supporting observations that mps may aid the survival of pathogens shen et al 2021 nevertheless the studied wwtp cw system lowers pathogen export via mps this observation in line with typical trends for microbial pathogens reduction of conventional wastewater treatment processes and in constructed wetlands alexander et al 2015 wu et al 2016 predatory activity might also play role in shaping pathogenic population on mps biofilms mps biofilms at sce and cw showed high populations of bdellovibrionaceae this family contains several predatory parasitic genera such as vampirococcus or bdellovibrio guerrero et al 1986 which pray on gram negative bacterial hosts including human pathogens such as e coli salmonella legionella and pseudomonas species sockett and lambert 2004 mps incubated in treated wastewater at sce and cw sampling points had an observable relative abundance 0 1 0 6 of bdellovibrionaceae dominated by aerobic genus of bdellovibrio with b bacteriovorus species the relative abundance of bdellovibrionaceae increased with incubation time experiment 1 and 2 and along treatments stages experiment 1 bdellovibrionacea were also observed in the planktonic community of sce and cw 0 14 and 0 02 respectively and control mps 0

disease in infected fish viršek et al 2017 aeromonas species were present after 4 d incubation at wwtp sce and cw but were not observed after 20 d of incubation sequencing data also revealed presence of stenotrophomonas and lactococus genera that include known fish pathogens pȩkala safińska 2018 latter were found in very small numbers 0 01 previous studies found fish pathogens i e aeromonas salmonicida on mps incubated in raw municipal wastewater lai et al 2022 these findings confirm that mps carrying pathogens are not only posing threat for human health but also for other aquatic organisms li et al 2022 3 4 amr dynamics in microplastic associated biofilms 3 4 1 fate of amr on mps associated biofilm mps transferred through all three stages of wastewater treatment developed a stable biofilm biomass ranging between 107 and 109 16s rrna gene copies gc 1g mp table s5 at equal incubation time the number of 16s rrna gene copies was almost 2 orders of magnitude higher on mps inoculated in raw sewage compared to mps incubated in the cw only experiment 3 fig 5 shows the relative amr gene abundance of each investigated amr gene in relation to the respective 16s rrna gene copies throughout the treatment process experiment 1 and 2 inti1 relative abundance varied by the factor of 4 ranging between 6 68 10 2 and 2 55 10 1 similar dynamics were observed for the sul1 gene in which sul1 gene levels remained within the range of 1 09 10 3 to 4 58 10 3 and relative abundance never exceeded a factor of three between treatment steps neither inti1 nor sul1 showed a stable decrease of relative abundance following treatment processes indicating lack of treatment step specific selective pressure between treatment steps ermb and tetw dynamics exhibited more than one order of magnitude variability the loss of ermb and tetw genes was most pronounced between rww and scw in both experiment 1 and 2 in experiment 1 sce showed a relative abundance of tetw and ermb in downstream cw without significant changes p 0 05 between treatment steps in experiment 3 mps incubated in the cw had negligible presence of ermb and tetw relative abundance 10 6 arg gc 16s rrna gene 2 orders lower than respective cw samples experiment 1 and 2 the sul1 gene relative abundance was similar across all three experiments amr gene dynamics of the planktonic community were dominated by the wwtp which enriched the final effluent amr sce however the cw planktonic community exhibited a 1 3 orders lower relative abundance of amr genes than the sce changes in relative amr abundance may serve as indicator for mps biofilm resistome alteration during treatment to assess the role of mps as a transport route for amr bacteria the ratio of amr relative abundance in biofilms and the respective planktonic community was calculated fig 6 the calculated ratio indicates whether there is a selective growth and enrichment of amr bacteria on either mps or in the planktonic community data show no clear enrichment pattern across all investigated amr genes but rather gene specific behavior depending on treatment stage and incubation time ermb and intii1 genes were between 2 and 100 times 2 log ratio enriched on mps while tetw relative abundance was always lower on mps 2 50 fold lower compared to the planktonic community no clear pattern was found for sul1 ambiguous fate of amr on mps was reported in disinfected wastewater effluent with higher abundance of qnrs and ermb genes in the planktonic community compared to the mps biofilm while sul2 showed the opposite trend galafassi et al 2021 similarly martínez campos et al 2021 found that depending on polymer type and applied treatment process presence of sul1 and tetm amr genes varies between mps biofilm and planktonic community without clear pattern the dynamics of amr acquisition by biofilm can be determined by mps sorption of antibiotics or slow release toxic additives and intermediates with often antimicrobial properties thus creating a selective growth environment promoting specific amr bacteria and triggering different resistance mechanisms atugoda et al 2021 syranidou and kalogerakis 2022 su et al 2021 based on findings of this study it cannot be excluded that mps biofilm may exert a positive effect on amr spread at gen level considering that the observed relative abundance of inti1 was consistently higher 2 100 fold difference fig 6 table s8 on mps future studies should incorporate high throughput sequencing to obtain full insight into a biofilm resistome responses to the temporal and treatment specific variability in wastewater treatment process 3 4 2 amr removal and community composition correlation regression random forest analysis shows amr gene specific dynamics table s6 changes of the microbial community during the treatment process explained almost 80 79 55 of tetw observed variability compared to 54 of sul1 gene dynamics ermb and inti1 dynamics were both equally affected 69 70 by differences in community composition between treatment stages only six unique genera were strongly correlated r 70 p 0 05 with sul1 none of them shared correlation with other amr genes fig 7 sul1 was the least affected by the shifting environmental conditions between treatment steps with the absolute abundance never decreasing more than 1 log unit 90 table 1 the observed relative persistence of sul1 can be attributed to persistence of sulfonamides resistance determinants which are poorly removed in wwtps thus triggering and maintaining selective pressure on the microbial community throughout the treatment process zhou et al 2022 sulfonamides were present in the studied system unpublished data additionally sul1 has high dissemination potential due to its mobility associated with broad range of plasmid types and relatively low metabolic burden for the host ensures preservation even in the absence of sulfonamides jiang et al 2019 wu et al 2010 tetw and ermb strongly correlated r 70 p 0 05 with 47 genera while sharing 23 genera including bacteriodes faecalibacterium or lactococus both tetw and ermb exhibited similar dynamics decreasing by 1 2 log units 90 99 along treatment stages and with incubation time higher tetw and ermb decrease might be due to the physicochemical properties of tetracycline and erythromycin respectively which are typically effectively immobilized in wwtps due to its high adsorption affinity and biodegradation potential liu et al 2019 shao and wu 2020 the fact that ermb and tetw dynamics were explained in high degree by the community composition shifts indicates on host specific relationships these are determined by environmental treatment conditions that also affects concentrations of antibiotics oberoi et al 2019 inti1 had a total of 28 correlated genera primarily anaerobic species belonging to fusibacter desulfobacter or anaerovorax dissemination of inti1 was limited 1 log reduction by the wwtp environment but only at prolonged incubation 20 d otherwise the inti1 gene abundance was relatively unaffected 0 5 log decrease or occasionally increasing table 1 amr genes were also correlated with pathogenic bacteria table s7 tetw and ermb correlated with aeromonas klebsiella and streptococcus r 50 p 0 05 ermb correlated with acinetobacter r 74 p 0 05 inti1 correlated only with pseudomonas r 46 p 0 05 sul1 did not show significant correlation with any investigated pathogenic genera table s7 except negative correlation with acinetobacter r 51 p 0 05 human fecal marker hf183 correlated with tetw but not with ermb in our study presence of pathogenic genera did not provide clear predictive measure for presence of amr increased sequencing depth could potentially uncover more detailed dynamics in future studies nevertheless the observed level of correlation emphasizes the extend of amr acquisition and transfer beyond the obvious pathogenic hosts dionisio et al 2023 that coincides with several reports showing complexity of amr surveillance programs which need to consider new dissemination factors for predictive analysis and control measures oniciuc et al 2018 pehrsson et al 2016 this is particularly important since amr host identification may play a critical role helping to target key amr reservoirs via pathogen specific phage therapy or engineered lysins rice et al 2020 3 5 the effect of cw on mitigation of microplastic associated pathogen and amr spread unlike some modern conventional wwtps cws are not equipped with dedicated disinfection steps to control pathogen and amr export nevertheless there are several processes that can effectively limit survivability and dissemination of pathogens and amr in cws including photoinactivation sedimentation and predation wenk et al 2019 wu et al 2016 in this study the role of cw as a primary recipient of sewage contaminated mps was simulated in experiment 2 the results show that observed decreases of mp associated amr in cw were less affected by the incubation time 4 d vs 20 d compared to the wwtp sce samples in experiment 1 the average difference between 20 d and 4 d in the cw was 0 1 log decrease in comparison to 0 91 log decrease observed at wwtp in experiment 1 table 1 although the cw exhibited a higher decrease in mp associated amr in the first 4 d of contact time the wwtp outperformed the cw when mps were incubated for a longer period the wwtp exerted increasing pressure on the mp associated amr community with increasing incubation time while the cw showed gene and time dependent variability the best performance was achieved when combining the wwtp with the cw polishing treatment that led to over 99 decrease of amr carried by mps experiment 1 this strengthens the case for using cws as polishing units coupled with conventional wwtps liu et al 2015 complete retention of mps in cws is not feasible due to the design limitations of the system bydalek et al 2023 however the observed pathogen and amr neutralizing capacity on mp biofilms during cw passage may reduce the immediate microbiological threats on receiving water bodies ecosystems the observed effectiveness of cw could be compromised by less favorable weather conditions in the wintertime due to lower temperatures limited solar irradiation and possible hydraulic overload due to rain events which would lower retention time therefore future studies should address seasonal variability of the fate of mp associated biofilm in wastewater treatment systems including specifically cws which are known to show seasonal performance variability myszograj et al 2018 varma et al 2021 4 conclusions the position of cw as a polishing step was beneficial to further neutralize the mp associated amr load exported from the wwtp increased mp incubation time within the wwtp and cw help eliminate both amr contamination and potentially pathogenic bacteria belonging to the genera pseudomonas arcobacter acinetobacter and streptococcus and klebsiella mps associated with amr showed gene specific dynamics aeromonas klebsiella and streptococcus were key pathogenic genera correlated with presence of amr in mp biofilms despite observed reduction in pathogens and amr load mps exported from wwtps and cws can be a source of fish pathogens aeromonas stenotrophomonas and lactococus and cyanobacteria potentially affecting downstream ecosystems as a primary treatment unit the cw delivered a consistent amr decrease independent from mps retention time 4 d or 20 d however the cw showed a variable effect on removal of pathogenic genera as a primary treatment step the cw was less efficient in neutralizing amr and pathogens on mps than the wwtp equipped with an oxidation ditch in combination the wwtp and the cw can provide over 99 decrease of amr and pathogenic load

polishing constructed wetland sequential microplastic colonization experiments were conducted at different stages of the wastewater treatment process including in raw sewage treated effluent and the constructed wetland two scenarios were tested in which the constructed wetland served as either i a polishing step or ii as primary recipient of sewage inoculated microplastics bacterial 16s rrna gene

constructed wetland pathogen and amr load decreased by up to two orders of magnitude after coupled conventional and constructed wetland treatment while less impact was observed when sewage inoculated microplastic material was directly transferred into the constructed wetland aeromonas klebsiella and streptococcus were key pathogenic genera correlated with amr in microplastic associated biofilms

oberbeckmann et al 2018 as a subcategory of plastic pollution microplastics mps plastic particles in the micrometer to lower millimeter size range frias and nash 2019 negatively affect aquatic and terrestrial wildlife due to disrupting animal digestive and immune systems and reproductive success li et al 2018 sharifinia et al 2020 mps and smaller sized nanoplastics also pose potential hazards to human health revel et al 2018 amr is among the top ten global public health problems there are more fatalities caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria than by hiv or malaria murray et al 2022 despite different origins and characteristics mp pollution and amr spread share similar environmental dispersion routes both mps and amr bacteria occur simultaneously in wastewater while wastewater treatment plants wwtps are hubs for both contaminants pazda et al 2019 ziajahromi et al 2017 along sewage and wastewater treatment mps are colonized by microbial biofilms mccormick et al 2014 including bacteria populations with high relative amr gene abundance lai et al 2022 especially in antibiotic rich wastewater berglund 2015 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are not specifically designed for complete mps or amr removal attenuation of mps by wwtps depends on treatment stage and technology ranging from 50 for basic secondary treatment towards 99 for advanced tertiary treatment blair et al 2019 raju et al 2020 talvitie et al 2017 despite high mps removal 95 achieved in large municipal wwtps conley et al 2019 kim et al 2022 the estimated release of mp via wwtps for example in germany is 0 6 106 to 1 2 106 mp particles per person annually schmidt et al 2020 a typical conventional wwtp would be expected to deliver 1 3 log 90 99 9 removal of amr genes advanced treatment such

and amr risks need to be also addressed in non conventional treatment such as constructed wetlands cws cws are a nature based low energy water treatment technology that mimic the purification processes of natural wetlands despite apparent limitations due to the low tech design and operation cws can treat various types of industrial agricultural and municipal wastewater chowdhury et al 2022 parde et al 2021 mps removal in cw from wastewater streams varies widely between 20 and 95 wang et al 2020 wei et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 amr removal in cws is comparable to conventional wwtps ma et al 2022 few studies have investigated biofilm growth on mps and related pathogen and amr spread in sewage and wwtps mps collected from wwtp effluent have a distinctively different bacterial community

spread of pathogens oberbeckmann et al 2018 proia et al 2016 moreover disinfection had little effect on microplastic associated biofilm composition and their ability to accommodate intact amr galafassi et al 2021 shen et al 2021 yang et al 2022 in summary there is strong evidence on the possible risk of increased amr spread through mps released by wwtps studies investigating mps biofilm

al 2022 martínez campos et al 2021 yang et al 2022 or laboratory studies eckert et al 2018 wang et al 2021 wu et al 2019 few field studies were carried out and none investigated time dependent colonization dynamics galafassi et al 2021 kelly et al 2021 or the role of cw systems in mitigating mp associated pathogen and amr hazard the aim of this study was to address this knowledge gap by looking at the combined effect of colonization time and treatment step dependent dynamics of mps associated amr and pathogens in wastewater colonization and amr evolution patterns on sterile mps were studied including how these patterns change along different stages of a conventional wastewater treatment process combined with a polishing cw downstream treatment of wastewater effluent via a polishing cw may alter mps biofilm composition and amr levels and minimize the synergy of mps pollution and amr spread beyond simple physical mps retention to test this hypothesis batches of sterile microplastics were successively incubated and transferred between different stages of a full scale treatment process equipped with a cw at varying incubation times and genetically analyzed this is the first mps sequential colonization experiment that provides both temporal and spatial analysis of mp biofilm alteration during a full scale wastewater treatment process additionally incorporating a cw

surface flow constructed wetlands acting as a polishing step fig 1 a the stw has operated since 1980s the cw operation was added in 2020 for enhanced phosphorus removal stw effluent and cw water quality data are available in supplementary data table 1s due to covid pandemic related restrictions in 2021 water quality monitoring of stw inflow raw wastewater was not possible cromhall cw has a surface of 0 8 ha and consists of 12 treatment cells of variable size depth and vegetation cover table s2 plant composition is dominated by the emergent macrophytes schoenoplectus lacustris and typha angustifolia open water zones are covered primarily with duck weed and low growing apium nodiflorum 2 2 experimental design the colonization experiment used four types of plastics including high density polyethylene hdpe polyvinyl chloride pvc polyethylene terephthalate pet and polystyrene ps fig s1a which represent major polymer types present in municipal wastewater including diversity of plastics physicochemical properties affecting biofilm formation azizi et al 2022 xu et al 2021 microplastics were produced via freeze grinding of commercial plasticware made from the selected polymers as indicated by the composition label produced microplastics were sieved to obtain a uniform specimen range of 0 50 0 75 mm approximately 400 mg of each polymer type was prepared in triplicates and each mp type loaded into separate stainless steel mesh tea infusers fig s1b and sterilized in an autoclave loaded infusers were attached to a steel chain and additionally wrapped into a coarse mesh bag to prevent accidental loss of samples infusers containing mps were transferred alongside the wastewater treatment process at three locations fig 1a to simulate successive transport and sequential colonization of mps through the wastewater treatment system fig s2 a d throughout the manuscript sampling locations are denoted as follows wwtp inflow point containing raw sewage rww effluent from secondary clarifier comprising of a final effluent from the wwtp sce treatment cell 6 at the cw cw three separate colonization experiments indicated with indexes 1 2 and 3 respectively were carried out simulating different travel routes of mps fig 1b colonization experiment 1 was based on successive transition of mps from sewage rww mps incubation point through the conventional wastewater treatment process sce followed by the polishing cw experiment 2 simulated a case when cw acts as primary recipient of wastewater by transferring mps directly from raw sewage rww into the cw while bypassing the secondary treatment step in experiment 3 sterile mps were deployed into cw as a quasi control to assess independently the effect of cw microbial community on mps colonization without sewage pre inoculation the study was carried out in a period of stable summer weather conditions july september 2021 without prolonged dry periods or heavy rain events reflected by water flow readings fig s3 each experiment was carried out at two colonization incubation times of 4 days and 20 days the selected incubation times were chosen to simulate short 4d and long 20d retention times applicable to mps in both conventional wwtp and cws while providing enough time span to ensure visible temporal shift in colonization patterns in conventional wwtps mps retention often correlates with suspended frehland et al 2020 solids retention time srt which varies between few days up 20 d and beyond depending on the treatment process vieno and sillanpää 2014 for cws use of hrt instead of srt to determine mps retention might be more adequate bydalek at al 2023 for the cw system studied here hrt ranges between 2d and 15d depending on the weather conditions and was typically 5 10 days during the study period the experimental timeline is shown in fig 1b the applied timeline synchronized mps deployment in the cw rather than in sewage rww to accommodate for more pronounced temperature fluctuation in the cw while also considering the relatively stable composition of municipal wastewater mps were first deployed into raw wastewater at the inflow of the wwtp rww following selected incubation times at each location mps were removed from infusers and washed with sterilized deionized water subsequently 100 mg mps from each infuser were transferred into separate 2 ml sterile centrifuge tubes and stored at 20 c until the further processing the remaining mps were transferred into new sterile infusers and then deployed into the next location mps of the four polymer types were incubated in separate infusers during the in situ colonization phases but were pooled together for the dna extraction to create an equal weight composite sample consisting of all 4 polymer types note that polymer type may affect colonization patterns on mps ramsperger et al 2020 tu et al 2021 we decided on pooled analysis of a representative plastics mixture in wwtps due to analytical cost considerations safety regulations did not allow deployment of infusers into the oxidation ditch and secondary clarifier instead infusers were placed in the wwtp final effluent chamber receiving wastewater from secondary clarifier sce cw treatment cell 6 served as a deployment site for mps due to its well established vegetation cover and position in the middle of the cw in the cw infusers were attached to a foam floater and submerged approximately 5 10 cm below water surface fig s2 d direct dispersion of mps onto the water surface was also considered but turned out unfeasible due a large wildfowl population dwelling in the cw over the study period additional water samples were collected to provide information on planktonic fraction of the microbial community background each sampling site was subsampled 3 times a day at 1000 ml sample size subsamples were later combined into a quasi daily composite sample a total of 3 quasi daily composites were collected for the sce secondary clarifier effluent and cw treatment cell tc6 each while the raw sewage rww was collected only once due to sampling restriction imposed by the covid pandemic water samples were immediately

metabolic niches in a high nutrient environment supporting diverse consortia development cao et al 2017 de kreuk et al 2005 wilén and balmér 1999 our data show that some of the original sewage microbial community is preserved on the 4 day incubated mps however biofilm communities that developed initially on mps immersed in sewage are less adaptable when transferred directly into the cw as indicated by the dissimilarities shown on the pcoa plain fig 2b this is probably due to fast transition from a nutrient rich low oxygen environment rww into an environment with higher oxygen concentrations and fewer readily available nutrients cw ghattas et al 2017 santos soares et al 2022 despite indications of potential biofilm preservation each treatment step left a unique footprint on a microbial community on the mps as shown by constrained analysis of principal component cap text s2 2 which was used to assess the impact of experimental design variables on the microbial community composition cap showed the combined effect of incubation time and location treatment step which explained 83 5 and 79 8 of community composition variability for experiment 1 and experiment 2 respectively 3 2 microplastic associated biofilm community composition proteobacteria emerged as primary colonizers of mps making up ca 90 of the biofilm community composition after 4 d contact time with raw sewage rww fig 3 with increasing incubation time 20 d relative abundance of protobacteria decreased to 60 with distinct changes in major proteobacterial families moraxellaceae and campylobacteraceae were dominant 65 after 4 d incubation while 20 d incubation shifted proteobacterial representation towards comamonadaceae and rhodocyclaceae 60 figs s4 and 5 proteobacteria represent a wide range of different types of metabolism and have been observed as key biofilm forming microbial taxa on mps in various environments guo et al 2022 lee et al 2008 miao et al 2019 that includes also known plastic degrading species as discussed in more detail in supplementary material text s1 fig s8 the raw wastewater inoculated biofilm showed a significant increase in gram positive bacteria after 20 d representing firmicutes 16 7 and actinobacteria 2 3 subsequent incubation of mps at sce for 4 d did not affect the phylum level diversity but showed a significant decrease of campylobacteraceae 5 and emergence of pseudomonadaceae 15 8 the taxonomic shift observed after 20 d in sce was more pronounced and resulted in acquisition of planctomycetes 22 7 chloroflexi 9 0 and acidobacteria 6 9 planctomycetes chloroflexi and acidobacteria are key phyla in biological wastewater treatment including within oxidation ditches as studied here zhang et al 2019 planctomycetes comprised mainly of pirellulaceae 37 and planctomycetaceae 36 which include known ammonia oxidizers critical also in the annamox process dos santos et al 2021 filamentous chloroflexi were represented by the a4b family 36 chloroflexi form and stabilize microbial flocks in activated sludge while acidobacteria species largely contribute to phosphorus and nitrogen removal processes kristensen et al 2021 nierychlo et al 2019 mps transferred from wwtp into the cw experiment 1 showed minor community shifts with acquisition of verrucomicrobiaceae and photoautotrophic rhodobacteraceae both families are widely found in sediments of wetland ecosystems ansola et al 2014 indicating population exchange and migration between wetland sediment and planktonic communities direct transfer of mps from rww into the cw experiment 2 manifested in shifts in the anaerobic population this included obligate anaerobic firmicutes veillonellaceae fusibacter anaerovorax trichococus replaced by planctomycetes and bacteroidetes fig 3 proteobacteria 75 90 of population were maintained irrespective of the incubation time and unlike to experiment 1 where the proteobacteria decreased sharply 85 to 34 family comamonadaceae showed to be most adapted to cw environment almost doubling its relative abundance ca 30 irrespective the incubation time at direct deployment of mps into the cw experiment 3 biofilms after 4 d were initially dominated by proteobacteria and bacteroidetes 92 2 total after 20 d the community also comprised of planctomycetes 13 7 verrucomicrobia 10 1 chloroflexi 1 8 and acidobacteria 2 1 mps also carried cyanobacteria 1 8 2 1 presumably due to algal blooms observed in the cw fig s7 algal blooms are a common operational problem of cws often indicating hydraulic mismanagement i e stagnant water zones or lack of adequate plant shading healy and cawley 2002 mps harboring cyanobacteria may facilitate spread of undesired algal blooms in downstream freshwater ecosystems curren and leong 2020 the planktonic community was dominated by bacteroidetes with significantly p 0 05 lower abundance of proteobacteria fig 3 the raw wastewater planktonic community was dominated by four bacterial families lachnospiraceae 23 8 ruminococcaceae 13 9 comamonadaceae 13 7 and prevotellaceae 11 9 fig s6 water samples collected from wwtp effluent were diverse with appreciable population of comamonadaceae 7 8 flavobacteriaceae 4 8 procabacteriaceae 4 8 pirellulaceae 4 and moraxellaceae 3 4 and 40 different families contributing 1 2 to community composition the diversity of clarifier effluent sce was in sharp contrast to the cw community composition where flavobacteriaceae and comamonadaceae comprised 75 of community composition and ten bacterial families 1 relative abundance fig s6 3 3 fate of pathogens in microplastic associated biofilms mps in raw sewage were colonized by up to 25 in relative abundance by genera comprising antimicrobial resistant eskape pathogens enterococcus faecium staphylococcus aureus klebsiella pneumoniae acinetobacter baumannii pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter species de oliveira et al 2020 lai et al 2022 some who list priority pathogens neisseria campylobacter and aeromonas were also found fig 4 the overall relative abundance of pathogenic genera was highest for mps incubated in raw wastewater transition of mps through wastewater treatment stages led to a steady decrease of this potentially pathogenic population at 20 d incubation relative abundance of acinetobacter species decreased over 2 orders of magnitude at sce and cw passage fig 4 and a 5 10 fold decrease of relative abundance of klebsiella species the observed loss of klebsiella contrasts a study reporting high survival on mps in wwtps kelly et al 2021 compared to planktonic bacterial communities mps biofilm had a 1 2 orders of magnitude higher relative abundance of pathogens fig 4 supporting observations that mps may aid the survival of pathogens shen et al 2021 nevertheless the studied wwtp cw system lowers pathogen export via mps this observation in line with typical trends for microbial pathogens reduction of conventional wastewater treatment processes and in constructed wetlands alexander et al 2015 wu et al 2016 predatory activity might also play role in shaping pathogenic population on mps biofilms mps biofilms at sce and cw showed high populations of bdellovibrionaceae this family contains several predatory parasitic genera such as vampirococcus or bdellovibrio guerrero et al 1986 which pray on gram negative bacterial hosts including human pathogens such as e coli salmonella legionella and pseudomonas species sockett and lambert 2004 mps incubated in treated wastewater at sce and cw sampling points had an observable relative abundance 0 1 0 6 of bdellovibrionaceae dominated by aerobic genus of bdellovibrio with b bacteriovorus species the relative abundance of bdellovibrionaceae increased with incubation time experiment 1 and 2 and along treatments stages experiment 1 bdellovibrionacea were also observed in the planktonic community of sce and cw 0 14 and 0 02 respectively and control mps 0 08 0 21 in experiment 3 a screening for known fish pathogens found a minor population 0 1 1 of aeromonas species identified as aeromonas hydrophilia or aeromonas salamonicida both known to cause ulcer disease in infected fish viršek et al 2017 aeromonas species were present after 4 d incubation at wwtp sce and cw but were not observed after 20 d of incubation sequencing data also revealed presence of stenotrophomonas and lactococus genera that include known fish pathogens pȩkala safińska 2018 latter were found in very small numbers 0 01 previous studies found fish pathogens i e aeromonas salmonicida on mps incubated in raw municipal wastewater lai et al 2022 these findings confirm that mps carrying pathogens are not only posing threat for human health but also for other aquatic organisms li et al 2022 3 4 amr dynamics in microplastic associated biofilms 3 4 1 fate of amr on mps associated biofilm mps transferred through all three stages of wastewater treatment developed a stable biofilm biomass ranging between 107 and 109 16s rrna gene copies gc 1g mp table s5 at equal incubation time the number of 16s rrna gene copies was almost 2 orders of magnitude higher on mps inoculated in raw sewage compared to mps incubated in the cw only experiment 3 fig 5 shows the relative amr gene abundance of each investigated amr gene in relation to the respective 16s rrna gene copies throughout the treatment process experiment 1 and 2 inti1 relative abundance varied by the factor of 4 ranging between 6 68 10 2 and 2 55 10 1 similar dynamics were observed for the sul1 gene in which sul1 gene levels remained within the range of 1 09 10 3 to 4 58 10 3 and relative abundance never exceeded a factor of three between treatment steps neither inti1 nor sul1 showed a stable decrease of relative abundance following treatment processes indicating lack of treatment step specific selective pressure between treatment steps ermb and tetw dynamics exhibited more than one order of magnitude variability the loss of ermb and tetw genes was most pronounced between rww and scw in both experiment 1 and 2 in experiment 1 sce showed a relative abundance of tetw and ermb in downstream cw without significant changes p 0 05 between treatment steps in experiment 3 mps incubated in the cw had negligible presence of ermb and tetw relative abundance 10 6 arg gc 16s rrna gene 2 orders lower than respective cw samples experiment 1 and 2 the sul1 gene relative abundance was similar across all three experiments amr gene dynamics of the planktonic community were dominated by the wwtp which enriched the final effluent amr sce however the cw planktonic community exhibited a 1 3 orders lower relative abundance of amr genes than the sce changes in relative amr abundance may serve as indicator for mps biofilm resistome alteration during treatment to assess the role of mps as a transport route for amr bacteria the ratio of amr relative abundance in biofilms and the respective planktonic community was calculated fig 6 the calculated ratio indicates whether there is a selective growth and enrichment of amr bacteria on either mps or in the planktonic community data show no clear enrichment pattern across all investigated amr genes but rather gene specific behavior depending on treatment stage and incubation time ermb and intii1 genes were between 2 and 100 times 2 log ratio enriched on mps while tetw relative abundance was always lower on mps 2 50 fold lower compared to the planktonic community no clear pattern was found for sul1 ambiguous fate of amr on mps was reported in disinfected wastewater effluent with higher abundance of qnrs and ermb genes in the planktonic community compared to the mps biofilm while sul2 showed the opposite trend galafassi et al 2021 similarly martínez campos et al 2021 found that depending on polymer type and applied treatment process presence of sul1 and tetm amr genes varies between mps biofilm and planktonic community without clear pattern the dynamics of amr acquisition by biofilm can be determined by mps sorption of antibiotics or slow release toxic additives and intermediates with often antimicrobial properties thus creating a selective growth environment promoting specific amr bacteria and triggering different resistance mechanisms atugoda et al 2021 syranidou and kalogerakis 2022 su et al 2021 based on findings of this study it cannot be excluded that mps biofilm may exert a positive effect on amr spread at gen level considering that the observed relative abundance of inti1 was consistently higher 2 100 fold difference fig 6 table s8 on mps future studies should incorporate high throughput sequencing to obtain full insight into a biofilm resistome responses to the temporal and treatment specific variability in wastewater treatment process 3 4 2 amr removal and community composition correlation regression random forest analysis shows amr gene specific dynamics table s6 changes of the microbial community during the treatment process explained almost 80 79 55 of tetw observed variability compared to 54 of sul1 gene dynamics ermb and inti1 dynamics were both equally affected 69 70 by differences in community composition between treatment stages only six unique genera were strongly correlated r 70 p 0 05 with sul1 none of them shared correlation with other amr genes fig 7 sul1 was the least affected by the shifting environmental conditions between treatment steps with the absolute abundance never decreasing more than 1 log unit 90 table 1 the observed relative persistence of sul1 can be attributed to persistence of sulfonamides resistance determinants which are poorly removed in wwtps thus triggering and maintaining selective pressure on the microbial community throughout the treatment process zhou et al 2022 sulfonamides were present in the studied system unpublished data additionally sul1 has high dissemination potential due to its mobility associated with broad range of plasmid types and relatively low metabolic burden for the host ensures preservation even in the absence of sulfonamides jiang et al 2019 wu et al 2010 tetw and ermb strongly correlated r 70 p 0 05 with 47 genera while sharing 23 genera including bacteriodes faecalibacterium or lactococus both tetw and ermb exhibited similar dynamics decreasing by 1 2 log units 90 99 along treatment stages and with incubation time higher tetw and ermb decrease might be due to the physicochemical properties of tetracycline and erythromycin respectively which are typically effectively immobilized in wwtps due to its high adsorption affinity and biodegradation potential liu et al 2019 shao and wu 2020 the fact that ermb and tetw dynamics were explained in high degree by the community composition shifts indicates on host specific relationships these are determined by environmental treatment conditions that also affects concentrations of antibiotics oberoi et al 2019 inti1 had a total of 28 correlated genera primarily anaerobic species belonging to fusibacter desulfobacter or anaerovorax dissemination of inti1 was limited 1 log reduction by the wwtp environment but only at prolonged incubation 20 d otherwise the inti1 gene abundance was relatively unaffected 0 5 log decrease or occasionally increasing table 1 amr genes were also correlated with pathogenic bacteria table s7 tetw and ermb correlated with aeromonas klebsiella and streptococcus r 50 p 0 05 ermb correlated with acinetobacter r 74 p 0 05 inti1 correlated only with pseudomonas r 46 p 0 05 sul1 did not show significant correlation with any investigated pathogenic genera table s7 except negative correlation with acinetobacter r 51 p 0 05 human fecal marker hf183 correlated with tetw but not with ermb in our study presence of pathogenic genera did not provide clear predictive measure for presence of amr increased sequencing depth could potentially uncover more detailed dynamics in future studies nevertheless the observed level of correlation emphasizes the extend of amr acquisition and transfer beyond the obvious pathogenic hosts dionisio et al 2023 that coincides with several reports showing complexity of amr surveillance programs which need to consider new dissemination factors for predictive analysis and control measures oniciuc et al 2018 pehrsson et al 2016 this is particularly important since amr host identification may play a critical role helping to target key amr reservoirs via pathogen specific phage therapy or engineered lysins rice et al 2020 3 5 the effect of cw on mitigation of microplastic associated pathogen and amr spread unlike some modern conventional wwtps cws are not equipped with dedicated disinfection steps to control pathogen and amr export nevertheless there are several processes that can effectively limit survivability and dissemination of pathogens and amr in cws including photoinactivation sedimentation and predation wenk et al 2019 wu et al 2016 in this study the role of cw as a primary recipient of sewage contaminated mps was simulated in experiment 2 the results show that observed decreases of mp associated amr in cw were less affected by the incubation time 4 d vs 20 d compared to the wwtp sce samples in experiment 1 the average difference between 20 d and 4 d in the cw was 0 1 log decrease in comparison to 0 91 log decrease observed at wwtp in experiment 1 table 1 although the cw exhibited a higher decrease in mp associated amr in the first 4 d of contact time the wwtp outperformed the cw when mps were incubated for a longer period the wwtp exerted increasing pressure on the mp associated amr community with increasing incubation time while the cw showed gene and time dependent variability the best performance was achieved when combining the wwtp with the cw polishing treatment that led to over 99 decrease of amr carried by mps experiment 1 this strengthens the case for using cws as polishing units coupled with conventional wwtps liu et al 2015 complete retention of mps in cws is not feasible due to the design limitations of the system bydalek et al 2023 however the observed pathogen and amr neutralizing capacity on mp biofilms during cw passage may reduce the immediate microbiological threats on receiving water bodies ecosystems the observed effectiveness of cw could be compromised by less favorable weather conditions in the wintertime due to lower temperatures limited solar irradiation and possible hydraulic overload due to rain events which would lower retention time therefore future studies should address seasonal variability of the fate of mp associated biofilm in wastewater treatment systems including specifically cws which are known to show seasonal performance variability myszograj et al 2018 varma et al 2021 4 conclusions the position of cw as a polishing step was beneficial to further neutralize the mp associated amr load exported from the wwtp increased mp incubation time within the wwtp and cw help eliminate both amr contamination and potentially pathogenic bacteria belonging to the genera pseudomonas arcobacter acinetobacter and streptococcus and klebsiella mps associated with amr showed gene specific dynamics aeromonas klebsiella and streptococcus were key pathogenic genera correlated with presence of amr in mp biofilms despite observed reduction in pathogens and amr load mps exported from wwtps and cws can be a source of fish pathogens aeromonas stenotrophomonas and lactococus and cyanobacteria potentially affecting downstream ecosystems as a primary treatment unit the cw delivered a consistent amr decrease independent from mps retention time 4 d or 20 d however the cw showed a variable effect on removal of pathogenic genera as a primary treatment step the cw was less efficient in neutralizing amr and pathogens on mps than the wwtp equipped with an oxidation ditch in combination the wwtp and the cw can provide over 99 decrease of amr and pathogenic load
