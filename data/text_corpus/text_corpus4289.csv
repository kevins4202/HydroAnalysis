21445,the unsteady planing motion in waves is a complicated problem that can lead to uncomfortable riding situation and structural damages due to large wave induced dynamic responses and vertical accelerations in the current research this problem is investigated using different approaches including towing tank tests computational fluid dynamics cfd and the 2d t model results obtained from all three approaches are compared against each other in details the spectral analysis shows that all motions can be nonlinear but cfd and 2d t model may predict weaker nonlinear behaviour at higher speed especially for the case of vertical accelerations corresponding to longer waves interestingly the vertical acceleration found by 2d t model is seen to be under predicted at moderate and long wavelengths and to be over predicted at short waves the values of sectional forces found by 2d t model were compared against cfd results showing that while the 2d t model computes smaller sectional forces it can also compute negative sectional forces near the bow of the vessel at short waves when the boat exits the water the emergence of negative sectional forces is likely to be the reason why

speed marine vehicles that are known as good performers in calm water conditions and owing to their prismatic hullform deep v bottom they can be widely constructed and used in coastal seas savitsky 1985 whereas these fast vessels are very popular there are some concerns about their performance in rough water conditions blount and codega 1992 codega and lewis 1987 large motions may occur when a planing vessel operates in waves even when waves are gently sloped rosen et al 2017 it is crucial to study the dynamic of these hulls in waves to evaluate whether a special design is a good performer in waves or not lueders 1959 marshall 2002 ghadimi et al 2019a but the unsteady planing problem has a very complicated hydrodynamic nature which makes the understanding of the problem very hard compared to displacement hulls simulation of the dynamic of a planing surface is more challenging meyers et al 1981 tavakoli et al 2017 dynamic of planing hulls in waves fig 1 refers to unsteady motions of a vessel operating in planing mode ulstein and faltinsen 1996 waves induce motions to the vessel and vertical acceleration at the bow of the vessel is expected to be very high katayama et al 2000 riley et al 2012 since hydrodynamic pressure is the dominant contributor supporting the weight of the vessel ghadimi et al 2015 2019b hydrodynamic of a planing vessel highly differs from that of non planing vessels i e displacement hulls heave and pitch motions are expected to be strongly coupled ghadimi et al 2016a and the hydrodynamic coefficients of the vessel are reported to vary over the time since the pressure pattern is changed remarkably during a single cycle tavakoli et al 2018a judge 2014 from an early planing speed to a super planing speed the resonances of heave and pitch motions can be highly increased fridsma 1969 savitsky 1985 motions of planing hulls are observed to be nonlinear and second as well as third harmonics are expected to partially involve fridsma 1969 savitsky 1968 begovic et al 2014 increase in the wave steepness is seen to have a nonlinear relationship with the dynamic response which becomes more significant by the increase in speed experimental measurements have shown that the nonlinearities in heave and pitch responses can become very strong in randomized waves since a wider range of frequencies contributes begovic et al 2016 nonlinearities are found to be more noticeable in the vertical acceleration of the vessel in many cases the acceleration is seen to go beyond 2g hou et al 2019 vanderwerken and judge 2017 razola et al 2016 causing an uncomfortable riding situation such a large acceleration not only causes mental problems for the crews lo martire et al 2017 but also it can cause structural damages for the boat once it slams the water neuberg and drimer 2017 drimer et al 2017 some planing hulls may show unstable behaviour in waves since the exciting wave loads can lead to an increase of trim angle the mean value of pitch which in turn results in the high shift of the centre of pressure during each cycle sun and faltinsen 2011a such an unsteady change in the centre of pressure eventually leads to an unstable motion and the rider slows down the vessel the added resistance of a planing vessel is expected to be highly larger than the added resistance of displacement hulls fridsma 1971 induced drag which is caused by hydrodynamic pressure highly depends on the speed and trim angle of the vessel the latter which is expected be increased in waves model tests are known as the first but the most reliable method that can be used to explore the dynamic response of a planing hull in waves wilson et al 1981 dynamic response of the vessel is recorded and the added resistance can be measured the vessel is towed in a wave basin while waves are mechanically generated the tests may be very expensive since a model is needed to be constructed and different equipment is required for measurement of motion or generation of waves some early experiments can be found in the work of lueders 1959 which was performed in the late 1950s fridsma 1969 performed a systematic study on wave induced motions of prismatic planing hulls in regular waves his research formed the early knowledge about unsteady planing motion which showed that a second resonance can emerge in the pitch response of the vessel at high planing speeds his experiments were used for empirical prediction the added resistance and vertical acceleration later empirically based methods which take the advantage of the experimental data have been used for modelling of the performance of planing hulls in calm water savitsky 1964 morabito 2014 the main challenge in empirical modeling is to find the hydrodynamic force acting on the boat and the centre of the forces pennino et al 2018a while empirical models can provide the forces and moments the results are not reliable when the planing vessel has unsteady motions in an unsteady motion as mentioned earlier the heave and pitch responses of the vessel in resonance zone are severe and besides the mean pitch and heave are different from the dynamic trim angle and cg rise up of the vessel running attitudes of the calm water owing to nonlinear nature of the problem thus the results of empirical equations that provide us with hydrodynamic coefficients only provide frequency domain simulations since they are developed for a perfect linear condition e g in faltinsen 2005 the equations governing on the fluid field around a planing hull can be solved using ideal flow or viscous flow assumptions matveev 2018 when the fluid is assumed to be incompressible and viscosity is assumed to be nil fluid is supposed to have a single phase nature and it obeys the laplace equations newman 1977 the radiation and diffraction problems that provide the hydrodynamic fluid forces moments acting on the structure are needed to be solved greco et al 2004 while such an assumption is reliable for the case of ships it can be less accurate for the case of a planing hull especially at high froude numbers the unsteady planing problem is nonlinear boundary conditions can be nonlinear and the motions are remarkable garme and rosen 2003 also flow separation from the chine and transom of the vessel occurs necessitating the consideration of the kutta condition mccauley 2018 doctors 1985 therefore the unsteady planing problem is far from being linear and the equations are needed to be solved in the time domain sun and faltinsen 2011b some researchers have recently attempted to solve the unsteady planing problem in the frequency domain using green integrations lin and lin 2019 de jong 2011 but their simulations are limited to low froude numbers early pre planing mode to overcome the limitations associated with the idea flow assumption the 2d t method is used as known this method provides an opportunity for simplifying the three dimensional problem by reducing it to a 2d problem troesch 1992 the 2d problem provides the flow field around 2d v shaped bodies whcih are similar to the section of a deep v boat akers 1999 martin 1976 niazmand bilandi et al 2018a but the 3d problem should be solved in the time domain i e a water entry problem is solved tavakoli et al 2018b a wide range of solutions ranging from linear ones to nonlinear ones for the 2d wedge sections have been offered by different researchers readers interested in water entry are invited to see details of the water entry and different solutions in the paper published by tassin et al 2014 a mathematical model for prediction of the motions of planing hulls in monochromatic waves was developed by zarnick using the 2d t method and the classic solution of water entry of 2d wedge sections zarnick 1978 this research is known as the milestone of the unsteady planing simulation by many experts as it opened a wider option for the next generation of researchers many researchers took the opportunity to use zarnick s method to increase the accuracy of the motion predictions for planing hulls some authors on the other hand suggested to use more complicated solutions of water entry using boundary element method for simulation of the 2d problem in the time domain vorus 1996 haase 2015 but the classic solution which is based on the momentum variation is still more popular since it is very fast and as reliable as the other 2d solutions when they are used for dynamic motion simulation hicks 1995 the method has been recently used for modelling of roll motion ghadimi et al 2016b tavakoli et al 2015 asymmetric planing ghadimi et al 2017a xu et al 1999 vertical motion pennino et al 2018 and even manoeuvring of planing hulls dashtimanesh et al 2019 tavakoli and dashtimanesh 2017b 2019 one of the reasons that makes the method very popular is that it can be easily extended to other designs of planing vessels like the stepped boats niazmand bilandi et al 2018b 2019 di caterino et al 2018 while the method has been used for a long time but the level of the accuracy of the 2d t method has not been studied for example the values of added resistance of the vessel and the vertical accelerations obtained through 2d t method has been rarely compared against experimental data moreover the nonlinear behaviour of the model still is needed to be studied to show how the method works in modelling of the nonlinearities of the vessel in waves such studies indeed provide a meaningfull understanding of the model performance that can be used for improving its accuracy in the case the fluid is assumed to be viscous the shear stresses in addition to the pressure are supposed to contribute in generation of forces tezdogan et al 2015 they can have higher contribution at higher speeds since the fluid becomes more turbulent esfandiari et al 2019 simulation of the problem can only be performed using the viscous flow assumptions larsson et al 2013 computational fluid dynamics cfd allows us to discretize the governing equation on the fluid flow and solve them in the time domain stern et al 2015 the cfd codes are found to be reliable tools for modelling of the planing problems either steady or unsteady ones dashtimanesh et al 2018 de luca et al 2014 2016 mancini et al 2017 de marco et al 2017 but they can be time consuming since the fluid is needed to be turbulent and motions involve a longer time is needed for simulation of the problem a new generation of the research has been sparked up in the recent years mousaviraad et al 2015 niazmand bilandi et al 2020 dashtimanesh et al 2020 roshan et al 2020 jiang et al 2017 yang et al 2019 many researchers have used different turbulent models dynamic modules to simulate hydrodynamic of planing hulls most of the researches have shown that the overset technique and urans unsteady reynolds averaged naiver stokes are more accurate while these researches have increased the body of the knowledge in the modelling of the planing problem they have mostly focused on calm water performance i e cfd simulations are performed up to the time heave and pitch of a planing hull converge pennino et al 2016 the research centring on the dynamic motion simulations are scant most of the available published data are general for example they have presented heave and pitch raos response amplitude operators even without comparing the results with experimental data due to the lack of experimental data but they have not focused on the vertical acceleration time history of the motions and other nonlinear aspects of the planing problem simply stated the knowledge about the ability of cfd codes in the modelling of unsteady planing problem is still immature furthermore recently a new research field is started based on the idea that the high fidelity calculation for ship performance resistance self propulsion seakeeping and manoeuvring attitude with cfd codes is likely to be much more difficult to achieve especially due to the high computational effort required one way of alleviating these burdens is by constructing approximation models known as metamodels or surrogate models which are used to replace the specific simulation based a variety of metamodeling techniques have been successively developed e g artificial neural network response surface method and kriging method all of these approximated models after a validation stage are used to carry out a large amount of the tests and only a few points generally the critical ones are investigated by cfd simulations or experimental tests see for instance serani et al 2019 and diez et al 2019 in the current research different methods are used to model dynamic of a planing hull it is aimed to understand the differences between the results of experimental cfd and mathematical models which shows the quality of different simulations in various contexts of unsteady planing new experiments are performed in towing tank of the university of naples federico ii a cfd model is used to simulate the dynamic response of the vessel in vertical directions the 2d t method is used to provide time domain simulation for the dynamic of the vessel also it is aimed to take the advantageous of cfd simulations to explore the hydrodynamic pressure acting on the vessel by sampling the data the rest of the current paper is outlined as follows section 2 presents the details of the experimental model and the test plans the formulation for the 2d t method is reported in section 3 the set up for the cfd model and governing equations on the fluid problem are presented in section 4 the main results of the current paper are reported and discussed in section 5 quantitative comparison between the results of all models are performed and it is shown how accurate the cfd model and 2d t method can be conclusion remarks are described in section 6 a detailed overview of the 2d t is shown in appendix a a mesh study for the cfd model is performed which is presented in the appendix b formulation for computation of the resistance of the vessel are described in appendix c calm water performance of the vessel is also studied using all three models and the corresponding data are presented in appendix d 2 towing tank tests 2 1 the basin and the planing model experimental tests are performed in the towing tank of the university of naples federico ii table 1 this tank can be used for both calm water and seakeeping tests and is equipped with a wavemaker the tank is 137 m long and 9 m wide it is filled with fresh water with a depth of 4 25 m a view of the tank is shown in fig 2 a carriage with a maximum speed of 10 m s is used to tow the vessel the vessel is towed forward by forces applied at the centre of gravity and midship the hull motions heave and pitch motions have been acquired by qualisys motion system which is composed of three infrared cameras that sight spherical markers as shown in fig 3 two triaxial accelerometers are also positioned to have a direct measure of the vertical accelerations the first is placed at the center of gravity the second one at 0 5 l forward to the center of gravity the wave height is measured with two different methods the first is a static measurement based on the capacitive sensors placed at 71 86 m in the middle of the tank the second one is an onboard system composed of three ultrasonic probes the first and second one located in front of the model transversely at b 3 and b 3 the third one is positioned on the side of the model in the x coordinate of the centre of mass far from the model to overcome the influence of the wave generated by the hull the two different methods are used because of an accurate measurement of steep waves throughout capacitive probes which however can only be used on the poolside the usonic system can easily follow the model to measure directly the encountered wave the side usonic probe allows also to evaluate the wave phase the resistance of the vessel in waves is measured using a load cell located at the end of the controlled shaft more details about experimental settings and the towing tank can be found in bove et al 2019 a planing model made up of wood is constructed and tested in the towing tank the vessel is the c2s hull model of the warped hull naples systematic series de luca and pensa 2017 details of this planing hull are reported in table 2 the body lines of the model and a photo of the vessel resting in the calm water are shown in fig 3 calm water tests of this vessel have been recently carried out by de luca and pensa 2017 irregular wave tests on series have been carried out in de luca and pensa 2019 2 2 tests plans one dimensional unidirectional monochromatic regular waves are mechanically generated at one end of the basin as 1 η i n a i n sin ω i n t ε i n where ω i n refers to the frequency of the generated wave and a i n denotes the amplitude of the wave ε i n is the phase shift of the wave this wave is identified as the incoming i n wave gentle waves are generated to satisfy linear wave theory and to avoid wave breaking banner et al 2000 non breaking turbulence babanin 2006 and modulation instabilities galchenko et al 2010 thus the water surface elevation at any point with a longitudinal distance of x from the wave generator can be found using 2 η i n x t a i n cos k i n x ω i n t ε i n where k i n is the wave number and related to the wave frequency under the deep water dispersion equation as 3 ω i n 2 g k i n wave number and wave frequency are computed by 4 ω i n 2 π t i n and k i n 2 π λ i n where t i n and λ i n respectively refer to the wave period and wavelength the vessel is towed with the speed of u from the other end of the basin to physically simulate a head sea condition i e encounter angle of π the speed of the vessel is categorized in planing regime the beam froude number of the vessel is given by 5 f r b u g b 0 5 the encounter frequency the frequency of the excitation can be computed as 6 ω e ω i n k i n u cos χ where χ is the encounter angle χ π for the current research the plan for tests is shown in fig 4 the vessel is set to be free in heave and pitch directions but it is restrained in roll sway and yaw directions different waves are generated as shown in table 3 to induce vertical motions to the vessel note that the quality of the wave maker in the generation of the desired waves is evaluated and the water surface elevations at different points of the tank are measured using wave gauges and compared against airy theory the vessel is tested in the all conditions shown in table 3 at two different speeds of 3 5 m s corresponding to beam froude number of 1 78 and 4 5 m s corresponding to beam froude number of 2 25 a picture of the planing model towed in waves is shown in fig 5 3 mathematical model 3 1 governing equations the 2d t method is used to mathematically simulate the dynamic motion of the planing vessel in waves this model is formulated by assuming two coordinate systems each of which advances with the vessel speed u the body frame denoted with g x b y b z b lies on the cg of the vessel the hydrodynamic frame however settles on the calm water line the body frame can have vertical motions both linear and angular but the hydrodynamic frame can never have any oscillation in the vertical plane the governing equation on the vessel thus can be formulated as 7 m z f z w and i θ f θ where f z and f θ are respectively fluid force in heave direction and moment pitch direction the force and moment both contain all different mechanism including restoring damping added mass nonlinear and wave exciting contributors it is important to note that thrust force contribution is neglected in the current research to mathematically reproduce the experiments please note that in our experiments no thrust force acts on the vessel furthermore the effects of thrust force on heave and pitch motions of the vessel in waves are scant therefore we have not considered the effects of thrust force on motions 3 2 2d t method the 2d t method is developed by using a simple assumption that reduces the three dimensional unsteady planing problem to an unsophisticated 2d problem if it is assumed that the vessel passes through a transverse plane while it is oscillating in the vertical plane the unsteady planing is turned into a water entry problem more details about this method are exposed in appendix a 3 3 mathematical set up using the 2d t method explained briefly in appendix a the final motion equations of the vessel are formulated as 8 m m z z z m z θ θ f z m θ z z i m θ θ θ f θ where m i j is the added mass inertia of the vessel in the direction of i generated by the acceleration in the direction of j these added mass coefficients strongly depend on the wetted surface pattern of the vessel and differ over time and are computed by 9 m z z l r x b m d x b cos 2 θ 10 m z θ l r x b m x b d x b cos θ 11 m θ z l r x b m x b d x b cos θ 12 m θ θ l r x b m x b 2 d x b also the forces with a superscript refer to the fluid force excluding the added mass contribution given by 13 f z f z m z z z m z θ θ f θ f θ m θ z z m θ θ θ to solve the problem in the time domain an unknown vector is defined as 14 q z θ z θ the governing equations on the dynamic of the rigid body are then solved in the time domain using a runge kutta merson method the vessel is divided into a finite number of sections and added mass values their time derivative and the sectional forces are computed using the wetted surface pattern note that the resistance of the vessel is also computed details about the method for computing the resistance can be found in appendix b 4 cfd model 4 1 fluid flow the fluid flow is assumed to be viscous and two phase containing air and water to provide simulations with consideration of flow separation and shear stresses the air water flow is assumed to be incompressible in the whole domain the flow is turbulent and velocity and stresses are related by newtonian fluid law the fluid field is governed by incompressible navier stokes ns equations 15 v 0 t ρ m v ρ m vv μ m μ t v v t f b 0 where v v x x t v y x t v z x t is the velocity vector and p x t is the fluid pressure ρ m x t and μ m x t respectively show the density and viscosity of the mixture of water and air at any point in the domain μ t is the turbulent viscosity of the flow depending on the turbulence model f b is the body force generated by gravity the water air flow is simulated by applying the volume of fraction vof scheme shown by t which vary between 0 air and 1 water using t the effective value of any physical properties of the mixture of water and air is calculated as 16 φ m φ w t φ a 1 t to link t to the fluid equations a conservation equation is used 17 t t t v v r 1 t 0 where v r refers to the compression velocity of the interface between water and air the force f f x f y f z and moment m f φ f θ f ψ vectors are calculated by using the pressure and stresses τ 18 f s τ p i n d s 19 m s r r g τ p i n d s then the governing equations on the dynamic of the vessel equation 7 are solved by setting the vessel to be free in heave and pitch directions 4 2 numerical set up a sketch of the numerical domain is shown in fig 6 where dimensions and the boundaries are displayed the vessel initially has a velocity of u 0 a numerical wave generator is activated at the right end of the numerical domain monochromatic waves are generated at this boundary as 20 η i n a i n sin ω i n t ε i n which matches with the method used in the towing tank tests for the wave generation the wave then travels toward the vessel inducing vertical motions the accuracy of the numerically generated waves is evaluated by comparing the numerical data against the airy theory a numerical probe is lactated at a distance of 0 7l pp from the inlet and the water surface elevation is recorded as shown in the upper panel of fig 7 a sample of the time history of the numerically generated wave dashed green is displayed in the lower panel of fig 7 the results corresponding to the wave forcing of case 5 table 3 are compared against airy theory solid red as seen the numerical data and theoretical data fit showing that the cfd model has reliable accuracy in simulation of water waves please note that details about the numerical set up boundary conditions and mesh generation are explained later side surfaces of the domain are forced to behave as an inlet velocity having the speed of u which is set to be equal to the velocity of the vessel this boundary condition provides an open sea simulation but wave damping absorption is activated on the sides and on the outlet of the domain to avoid any wave reflection the side surfaces are set to be 2 5l pp far from the vessel the other end of the domain is prescribed to satisfy the neuman bc for all terms which provides a pressure outlet surface again waves are set to be absorbed in this boundary water is set to flow in the domain from the inlet surface with the velocity u an overset region is generated in the domain the body of the planing hull is attached to this region the overset region moves with the body in each time step the overset region is set to have a cubic shape with dimensions of 1 2 l 0 5 l 0 5 l note that the water depth is set to be height enough to satisfy the deep water condition all the domain dimensions are in line with all the best practices available ittc 2011 and the relevant papers in this field tezdogan et al 2015 de luca et al 2016 summary of bcs is reported in table 4 two grids are generated to model the dynamic motion of the vessel a background grid and an overset grid fig 8 the first represents the numerical domain and the second one contains the vessel and the region around it the coupling between the overset and background region is obtained by an interpolation scheme which is based on the distance weighted note that this method is known as the most robust scheme when large relative motions occur siemens plm software 2019 the cells near the water surface are set to be finer compared with the rest of the domain and are generated using trimmer anisotropic see details in siemens plm software 2019 four different grids table 5 are generated using a refinement ratio of 2 ittc 2011 to find the proper mesh that can be used for simulation of the problem a mesh independence study is carried out dynamic response of the vessel induced by regular wave is numerically simulated using each of these grids the results suggest that the fine grid g3 is the best option for the discretization of the domain to make the paper easier to follow the mesh study results are presented in appendix b 4 3 numerical approach the problem is numerically solved using a cfd code star ccm by plm siemens this cfd code discretizes the mass and momentum conservation equations using the finite volume method fvm the ns equations as well as the conservation of t are solved by using the simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations approach details of this approach can be found in most of cfd references siemens plm software 2019 andersson et al 2011 kajishima and taira 2017 the convection terms as well as the diffusion terms are turned into algebraic parameters using second order upwind and second order centred methods respectively the unsteady terms are discretized in the time domain by applying a second order backwards euler technique the μ t is found by implementing the k ε model details of which can be found in wilcox 1998 and siemens plm software 2019 the velocity field near the wall of the vessel is numerically modelled by the all wall y scheme so the y is set to be y 120 fig 9 according to the best practices suggested in ittc 2011 tezdogan et al 2015 and siemens plm software 2019 the dynamic equations are solved using a dynamic solver module known as pseudo compressibility approach tu et al 2018 siemens plm software 2019 the differential equations of the motion are discretized in the time domain and the acceleration speeds and displacements of the next time step are found the courant number cfl is set to be smaller than 0 5 during the simulations the selected time step satisfies the recommendations of the ittc 2011 i e one encounter period is solved during 100 time steps or more the second order temporal scheme is used to discretize the unsteady terms of the ns equations the initial pitch angle is set to be equal to the dynamic trim angle of the vessel similarly initial heave is set to be equal to the cg rise up of the vessel numerical simulations are performed in the time domain the early period of simulations in which the mean pitch and heave of the vessel significantly vary are ignored 5 results and discussion 5 1 heave and pitch motions samples of time histories of wave induced heave and pitch motions of the planing hull at two different wavelengths of 2 2l and 4 34l are respectively shown in fig 10 and fig 11 in all cases both motions are seen to be harmonic as expected the vessel experiences a greater number of cycles during each period t i n which agrees with theory the encounter angle is π head sea condition and thus the encounter frequency is larger than the frequency of the incoming wave the mean value of heave of the vessel is seen to be larger at the froude number of 2 28 which fits with the physics of problem i e cg rise up increases by the increase in speed at both wavelengths upper row of figs 10 and 11 the mean value of the pitch of the vessel is also seen to grow by the increase in speed as well the 2d t method does not properly follow the experimental data at the wavelength of 2 2l and beam froude number of 1 78 for example at the smaller speed 2d t computes a smaller amplitude for both heave and pitch motions at the higher speed the amplitude of heave and pitch motions computed by the 2d t method are comparable with experimental data but the mean heave and pitch found through 2d t simulations are larger than experiments the cfd data on the other hand shows more reliable behaviour that is cfd results agree with experimental data in most of the cases the only notable difference can be seen in the pitch response of the vessel at a higher speed compared to waves with λ i n 2 2 l 2d t method is observed to provide more accurate data for the case of incoming waves with λ i n 4 34 l especially at smaller speeds results are shown in fig 11 supports this fact the cfd model is still showing reliable behaviour for heave motion at λ i n 4 34 l but the pitch motion is seen to be computed with less accuracy at the higher beam froude number it is interesting to note that the value of mean heave and mean pitch at longer waves calculated using the 2d t method are more accurate compared to the shorter waves heave and pitch responses of the vessel are computed at all forcing conditions the responses are computed using a zero crossing method the difference between crest and trough of each cycle was found and then was divided over 2 the mean value of all cycles was then computed fig 12 displays the values of heave and pitch response of the vessel at two different beams froude numbers the results of all three models are presented in this figure to provide an understanding of their behaviours the data is also presented in table 6 heave response and table 7 pitch response the data measured in the towing tank tests show that heave and pitch motions of the vessel both show an over damping behaviour at both modelled speeds heave response is close to zero at very short waves and then converges to 1 0 at very long waves as expected i e at long waves the boat follows the motion of waves for the case of pitch response similar behaviour is observed the pitch response is very close to zero at the shortest wave and finally approaches the wave slope at the longest waves moreover heave and pitch responses increase by the increase in speed which agrees with the previous laboratory measurements of different researchers 2d t model provides similar behaviour results obtained by this model follows the experimental data but the accuracy of this model is not acceptable at wavelength varying between 2l to 3l the 2d t method is seen to under predict the results at this range of wavelengths compared with the 2d t method the cfd model is observed to provide more accurate data especially at the higher beam froude number at the smaller beam froude number the cfd model computes a very weak resonance for both heave and pitch motions at the wavelength of 2 2l a spectra analysis is carried out to evaluate the differences between models in more details fast fourier transform module of the matlab is used and the energy spectra of the time histories of different data are computed fig 13 shows the energy spectrum of heave and pitch motions of the vessel at the wavelength of 4 34l as seen the energy spectrum of the heave and pitch motions are nonlinear at smaller speeds left panels the energy is seen to emerge at both smaller and larger frequencies at this speed by the increase in speed the energy spectrum of both heave and pitch motions becomes linear and energy is focused at ω ω e 1 note that all three models result in similar behaviour at both speeds the energy spectrum of the heave and pitch motions at a wavelength of 2 2l is displayed in fig 14 as apparent the energy spectrums of both motions are linear at the smaller speeds which is in contrast with the results corresponding to the wavelength of 2 2l fig 13 the energy spectrum of the measured heave motion experimental model is seen to be linear at larger beam froude number but the energy spectrums resulted from the cfd and 2d t models are seen to be nonlinear for this speed the energy spectrum of the pitch motion of the vessel is seen to be strongly nonlinear at larger speed a large amount of energy has been seen to be shifted toward smaller frequency both simulations of the 2d t and cfd models predict such a nonlinear behaviour for pitch motion at this speed overall the results presented in figs 13 and 14 show that by the increase of beam froude number nonlinear motions occur at the smaller wavelength and the pitch motion of the vessel becomes more nonlinear compared to heave motion also cfd and 2d t models are seen to have reliable predictions at most of the cases they only failed to predict accurate energy spectrum for heave motion of the vessel at λ 2 2 l at higher beam froude number 5 2 vertical acceleration the vertical acceleration of the vessel at cg is computed using all three models samples of time histories of the vertical acceleration the vessel at cg are plotted in fig 15 and fig 16 the results presented in these two figures respectively correspond to the wavelengths of 2 2l and 4 34l as apparent in these figures vertical acceleration of the vessel is non linear i e each cycle is seen to be skewed toward the next cycle asymmetric shape and the trough of the cycle is sharp by the increase in speed nonlinearities increase that is trough becomes sharper and each cycle becomes more asymmetric for the case of a longer wave acceleration is seen to be smaller larger speed also is seen to result in larger acceleration note that the values of crest and trough of the vertical acceleration are not the same for instance the vessel is exposed to vertical accelerations of 0 42g and 0 48g at each cycle when it is operating at froude number of 2 28 and waves with λ i n 2 2 l long cfd data is seen to follow the experimental data in most of the cases the data computed using cfd fairly matches with experiments at the higher speed however cfd data is less nonlinear for example at froude number of 2 28 and wavelength of 2 2l the trough of the cfd is less skewed toward the next cycle the results computed through the 2d t simulations are seen to follow the data but they are less accurate compared to the cfd the crest is seen to be predicted with better accuracy but the errors in the prediction of the trough are more significant this shows that while 2d t computes smaller force when the vessel impacts the water interestingly this fact is consistent with what has been observed previously 2d t was seen to under predict the heave response which can be caused by a smaller force spectrums of the vertical acceleration at cg are computed using fft which can show nonlinear the acceleration is the experimental results presented in fig 17 and fig 18 reveal that vertical acceleration is strongly nonlinear at all speeds energy is distributed between two or more harmonics at higher beam froude number the value corresponding to two dominant harmonics are very close and small proportions of energy emerge at higher and smaller frequencies spectrums corresponding to 2d t and cfd results vertical acceleration at cg also show nonlinearities but they do not match with experimental results in all conditions when the vessel advances at smaller beam froude number both cfd and 2d t model predict the harmonics with more reliable accuracy at the higher speed the accuracy of both cfd and 2d t models in prediction of harmonics decrease vertical accelerations at cg computed by cfd and 2d t models are observed to be narrower compared to the experimental data more amount of energy is focused at the dominant frequency for the case of cfd and 2d t models at higher beam froude numbers for the case of long waves the accuracy of cfd is more reliable overall the presented spectrum results show that while the vertical acceleration of a planing hull is strongly nonlinear which becomes more significant by the increase in speed cfd and 2d t models cannot accurately compute nonlinearities at higher speeds the computed values for the vertical acceleration at cg are computed using a zero crossing method the difference between crest and trough is found and then divided by 2 fig 19 displays the values of vertical acceleration at cg obtained using three different models the values of vertical acceleration at cg are also presented in table 8 at the smaller speed as apparent two peaks one at 2 57l and one at 3 58l emerge at the higher speed again two peaks can be observed but the smaller peaks occur at a shorter wavelength compared to the smaller beam froude number the emergence of two peaks z c g g vs λ i n l plots confirms the nonlinearity of the motion the peak value corresponding to the longer wave λ i n 3 58 l obtained through experimental tests is seen to increase up to 0 15g by the increase in speed moreover experimentally measured vertical accelerations occurring around the peak value for example at 3 01l and 3 58l increase up to 0 3 0 4g by the increasing speed this fact shows that hydrodynamic pressure acting on the bottom of the vessel strongly affect the forces acting on the boat that is as the speed increases hydrodynamic pressure becomes more dominant leading to larger force and vertical acceleration the results of the cfd model are seen to follow experimental data at a smaller speed also cfd data fairly with experimental data at a smaller speed at the higher speed the cfd model has reliable accuracy at shorter waves but its accuracy decreases by the increase in wavelength the 2d t model is seen to follow the experimental data at both speeds but it highly under predicts the value of vertical acceleration at all cases except very small waves results of the 2d t model show that while the cfd model can provide nonlinear results it under predicts the vertical forces acting on the vessel such an under prediction agrees with the results presented in fig 12 the maximum value of the vertical acceleration occurs at the trough as was observed in figs 15 and 16 its value shown by z m a x is found for all forcing conditions and presented in fig 20 the results presented in this fig show that the behaviour of z m a x vs λ i n l is similar to that of z c g vs λ i n l in all cases peaks occur at similar wavelengths but the value of z m a x is partially larger compared to z c g at all cases such a difference is in consistence with what was observed in the presented time histories for z c g some researchers have previously discussed the poor accuracy of the 2d t model in prediction of the vertical acceleration according to what was observed here it can be suggested that an accurate water exit model is required to be used for computation of the forces acting on a planing vessel to predict the acceleration of the vessel with better accuracy 5 3 resistance in waves the resistance of the vessel in waves is also computed using both cfd and 2d t models the value of resistance is also measured during the experiments using a cell load located at the forward end of the controlled shaft see de luca and pensa 2019 the resistance of the vessel as expected has shown harmonic behaviour a sample of the time history of the resistance in waves is shown in fig 21 where cfd and 2d t results are following the experimental data mean values of all data fairly agree experimental data however reach the larger crest and the smallest trough in each cycle there might be different reasons for such behaviour one of the main reasons is the method used for measuring resistance the vessel is oscillating in vertical directions with larger vertical acceleration that can cause differences when resistance reaches its highest and smallest values the fluctuations emerged in the resistance plot also confirm this point but the mean values agree as mentioned earlier the mean value of the resistance of the vessel in waves is computed for all cases and then scattered in fig 22 the results presented in this figure show that the mean resistance of the vessel in waves differs from one wavelength to another which agrees with the physics of ship behaviour in rough waves a peak value occurs at the wavelength of 1 34l resistance in waves converges to zero when waves get longer at both speeds this behaviour for resistance in essence is in agreement with the physics of wave structure interaction theoretically the drift force the wave induced force which contributes to resistance of the vessel operating in waves caused in wave direction is nil when waves are long aranha 1994 increase in the speed of the vessel leads in the increment of the resistance in waves at all forcing conditions which is in consistence with reality that is the resistance of the vessel is expected to increase by the increase in speed the reported data for calm water performance of the vessel shows this fact appendix d the peak of resistance which emerges at the wavelength of 1 34l is increased up to 17 3 by the increase in speed the cfd and 2d t results agree are in fair agreement with experimental data which proves that both models are reliable enough to be used for computation of the resistance of the vessel in waves please note that the data corresponding to the resistance of the vessel is also reported in table 9 5 4 hydrodynamic pressure hydrodynamic pressure acting on the bottom of the vessel is sampled in numerical simulations the results corresponding to the wavelengths of 2 2l and 4 34l are reported in this section these results can help us to understand the physics of an unsteady planing motion in more details note that the hydrodynamic pressure is sampled at four different instants covering a half cycle during which vessel moves upward from its mean heave to maximum and then it moves downward again results corresponding to the beam froude numbers of 1 78 and 2 28 are presented in fig 23 and fig 24 respectively a longitudinal snapshot is also shown in which the boat position and water surface around the vessel can be seen as seen a transom suction occurs behind the stern of the vessel showing that when a vessel moves at planing range in rough waves transom waves occur like steady motion the pressure is seen to be zero at the transom and chines of the vessel which agrees with physics of planing in steady condition also such conditions are in agreement with 2d t assumptions where zero pressure is set on chines and transom of the vessel when the vessel moves upward pushed up by waves high pressure appears at the intersection of the water with the keel this pressure is larger when waves are 2 2l long as the vessel reaches a higher vertical position peak pressure increases and also pressure at stagnation line increases note that at this stage of the motion instant pitch of the vessel is higher compared to the previous stage at the next stages vessel locates at higher heave and pitch the distribution of pressure on the maximum pressure line also known as stagnation line demonstrates that the pressure near chine becomes larger for the waves with the longer length the pressure is seen to be larger at this stage at the final stage the vessel reaches its maximum heave and then tends to move downward interestingly larger pressure occurs near the transom at the stagnation line which is significant for the case of long waves such behaviour for hydrodynamic pressure is observed for both speeds but at a higher speed the pressure is larger as expected it is very important to note that during this half cycle the wetted surface of the vessel decreases and becomes thinner overall as a planing hull operates in a head sea maximum pressure appears at the intersection of the keel with water when the vessel locates at its mean pitch maximum pressure which occurs at stagnation line moves towards chine as the vessel moves upward if waves are longer maximum pressure will be smaller when the vessel is located at the mean heave but as the vessel moves upward the maximum pressure corresponding to longer waves becomes higher 5 5 sectional forces comparison between cfd and 2d t results as it was seen the results found through cfd simulation and the current 2d t method do not agree in all forcing conditions especially for the case of vertical acceleration to understand the reason for the differences sectional forces found by both models are compared against each other the results are displayed in fig 25 through 28 in each figure four panels are illustrated each of which corresponds to an instant the upper panels refer to the time steps during which the vessel is moving downward heave speed is negative identified by and the lower ones refer to the times vessel is moving upward as seen in all figures when the vessel moves downward upper panels the sectional force increases by the increase in distance from the bow and reaches a peak value then it decreases and reaches a second peak finally it vanishes at the transom which meets the real physics kutta condition cfd results black solid and the data found by the current 2d t method red dashed provide the evidences for this fact at the next stage as the vessel moves upward lower panels the sectional force is seen to have one peak in most of the cases in this condition fig 25 λ i n 2 2 l and 26 λ i n 1 1 l show the data corresponding to the froude number of 1 78 as apparat when the vessel advances in waves with a length of λ i n 2 2 l the sectional forces computed by the current 2d t method are smaller compared to the values given by cfd at most of the sections the peak values of the force computed by the current 2d t model however are found to be slightly larger compared to the cfd data in most of the cases in the forcing condition of λ i n 1 1 l the 2d t method has seen to compute negative sectional force in the vicinity of the bow of the vessel when it is moving upward during the phases the vessel is moving downward the negative force computed by 2d t method is seen to disappear upper row of fig 26 but compared to the data computed by the cfd model the method has seen to give smaller sectional forces when its moving downward upper panels the high change from negative sectional force to positive sectional forces computed by the current 2d t model can lead to the high difference between crest and trough of vertical force acting on the vessel in a cycle therefore the current 2d t method computes a larger vertical acceleration at short waves as it was observed and discussed earlier see fig 19 the data corresponding to the froude number of 2 28 is shown in figs 27 λ i n 2 2 l and 28 λ i n 1 1 l again compared to the results found by cfd simulations the 2d t method is seen to compute smaller sectional forces at most of the sections of the vessel when waves are 2 2 l long no negative sectional force is given by the 2d t method at the phases vessel is exiting the water but for the cases of the shorter waves λ i n 1 1 l negative sectional forces are found to emerge near the bow of the vessel as it exits the water this shows that like the lower speed corresponding to the beam froude number of 1 78 negative sectional forces appear when the vessel moves upward in short waves this fact shows that the main reason that manages the current 2d t method to over predict the short wave induced vertical acceleration is the negative sectional forces computed on the other hand under the action of longer waves like λ i n 2 2 l sectional force is found to be smaller than the values computed by cfd which is seen to lead to under prediction of the vertical acceleration overall while the current 2d t model which is based on the momentum variation can provide reliable data for heave and pitch motions there are still doubts about its ability in computing the sectional forces in short waves therefore other methods like vorus 1996 can be used for computation of sectional forces in near future proving us with a better understanding of the force distribution on a planing hull advancing in waves especially short waves 6 conclusion dynamic of a hard chine planing hull was studied using three different models it was aimed to explore the differences between the results of each of these models and to improve understanding of unsteady planing motion the vessel was firstly modelled in towing tank and its motions as well as resistance were measured in head sea condition then mathematical simulations using the 2d t model were performed and heave and pitch responses as well as resistance were found at the final stage a cfd model was utilized to reproduce the experiments in a numerical wave tank heave and pitch of the vessel were observed to be nonlinear in some cases pitch of the vessel was seen to be strongly nonlinear at the wavelength of 2l and higher beam froude number at longer waves λ i n 4 l heave and pitch motions were found to show a weak nonlinear behaviour both cfd and 2d t method provided reliable data for nonlinearity except for the pitch motion at high speed the amplitudes of heave and pitch motions of the studied planing hull were observed to be over damped at both considered speeds it was seen that the cfd data heave and pitch responses and the results obtained from the 2d t simulations follow the experimental results but it was demonstrated that the 2d t method under predicts the heave and pitch response this under prediction was demonstrated to be significant at 2 l λ i n 4 l the heave and pitch responsesfound by cfd model were observed to be smaller than the experimentally measured data at long waves the increase in the speed was seen to result in larger heave and pitch responses as expected the vertical acceleration of the vessel at cg was found to be nonlinear which becomes stronger by the increase in speed the spectrum of the vertical acceleration was seen to emerge at a greater number of harmonics at longer waves it was demonstrated that while cfd and 2d t methods can provide nonlinear behaviour for vertical acceleration they cannot follow the experimental data both cfd and 2d t models provided larger energy for ω ω e and smaller energy for ω ω e overall cfd and 2d t methods provide a weaker nonlinear response for the vertical acceleration at cg the amplitude of vertical acceleration at different forcing condition was investigated it was shown that two peaks occur in the z c g vs λ i n l plots the peak corresponding to the longer wave was found to increase by the increase in speed while the other one was seen to be decreased also the peak of z c g corresponding to shorter waves was seen to emerge at waves with smaller λ i n by the increase in speed 2d t method was seen to under predict the amplitude of vertical acceleration at waves with moderate and long waves but over predict vertical acceleration at short waves cfd data provided reliable simulations at smaller speed but at the higher speed the cfd data were seen to converge from the experimental data at long waves which can be attributed to the weaker nonlinear response computed by the model the resistance of the vessel in the wave was seen to reach a peak at λ i n 1 34 l and increases by the increase in speed the results obtained using the 2d t method and cfd model were shown to be in fair agreement with experimental data hydrodynamic pressure computed using the cfd model was sampled for different forcing conditions it was seen that when the vessel comes out of the water the pressure acting on the stagnation line starts to become larger near chine it was demonstrated that when waves are longer maximum pressure is larger which emerges near chines on the stagnation line at the phase the vessel reaches its highest vertical position but when the vessel locates at its mean heave the maximum pressure which appears on the intersection of the water and keel corresponding to the waves with moderate lengths λ i n 2 2 l is higher also the pressure area of the vessel was seen to be smaller at λ i n 2 2 l compared to the longer waves λ i n 4 34 l sectional forces computed by 2d t and cfd models were sampled it was shown that when waves are short e g λ i n 1 1 l negative sectional forces might be computed by 2d t method especially when the vessel is exiting the water which can be one of the main reason that the 2d t model over predicts the vertical acceleration at short waves at moderate waves e g λ i n 2 2 l however current 2d t model was seen to compute smaller sectional forces compared to cfd model which is in consistence with computed values of vertical acceleration at that range of wavelengths i e compared to cfd the current 2d t model computes smaller vertical acceleration at long waves to sum the dynamic motion of a planing hull is strongly nonlinear which becomes stronger by the increase in the speed nonlinearities corresponding to the vertical acceleration are significant the cfd and 2d t method can compute nonlinear behaviour at the early planing speed but by the increase in speed their results become less reliable they can still provide acceptable accuracy for the heave and pitch responses at different wavelengths 2d t method however can have larger errors at wavelengths of 2l 3l these errors are linked to the errors occurring in the computation of the forces acting on the vessel the 2d t method can under predict the vertical force acting on the boat in waves especially when the vessel is exiting the water and waves are short more accurate solution of the water entry and water exit problems are required to be implemented in the model to improve its quality it is important to note that a 2d t method is a reliable tool that can be used in the simulation of the dynamic motion of boats and modifying its accuracy can be very helpful in the early stage design of planing hulls cfd model is shown to be a reliable hydrodynamic tool in the simulation of the motion but there might be some errors in the prediction of the acceleration at long waves since it cannot simulate the real physics strong nonlinear behaviour of the vertical acceleration of the motion in the future deeper studies are required to be carried out to increase the accuracy of the cfd model in the prediction of the vertical acceleration for instance the recent application of the adaptive mesh refinement technique could be a promising way to enhance the accuracy of the cfd especially in the mesh discretization in particular for the strong non linear cases finally the 2d t method could be used to develop metamodels or surrogated models combined with a few numbers of check points performed with high fidelity cfd simulations to obtain a fast or eventually real time method for early stage analysis or fast craft behaviour simulation credit authorship contribution statement sasan tavakoli conceptualization

mesh that can be used for numerical experiments cfd modelling the dynamic response of the vessel induced by a wave with λ i n 3 58 l is simulated for the considered planing hull at beam froude number of 2 28 simulations are run for all four generated grids the results obtained through numerical simulations suggest that the fine grid which contains 1 384 million of cells is the best option that can be used for simulations results are shown in fig 30 confirms that the results heave response converge for this grid note that all the cfd data shown in section 5 of the paper are computed using grid 3

details about the measurements of running attitudes dynamic trim angle and cg rise up and the resistance can be found in de luca and pensa 2017 both the cfd model and 2d t methods are also used to compute the performance of the vessel in calm water condition the wave amplitude is set to be zero and then the simulations have been carried out up to the time heave and pitch converge to constant values these constant values of heave and pitch are respectively set to be cg rise up and dynamic trim angle of the vessel fig 31 shows samples of the convergence of data for both cfd blue dashed plot

21445,the unsteady planing motion in waves is a complicated problem that can lead to uncomfortable riding situation and structural damages due to large wave induced dynamic responses and vertical accelerations in the current research this problem is investigated using different approaches including towing tank tests computational fluid dynamics cfd and the 2d t model results obtained from all three approaches are compared against each other in details the spectral analysis shows that all motions can be nonlinear but cfd and 2d t model may predict weaker nonlinear behaviour at higher speed especially for the case of vertical accelerations corresponding to longer waves interestingly the vertical acceleration found by 2d t model is seen to be under predicted at moderate and long wavelengths and to be over predicted at short waves the values of sectional forces found by 2d t model were compared against cfd results showing that while the 2d t model computes smaller sectional forces it can also compute negative sectional forces near the bow of the vessel at short waves when the boat exits the water the emergence of negative sectional forces is likely to be the reason why

speed marine vehicles that are known as good performers in calm water conditions and owing to their prismatic hullform deep v bottom they can be widely constructed and used in coastal seas savitsky 1985 whereas these fast vessels are very popular there are some concerns about their performance in rough water conditions blount and codega 1992 codega and lewis 1987 large motions may occur when a planing vessel operates in waves even when waves are gently sloped rosen et al 2017 it is crucial to study the dynamic of these hulls in waves to evaluate whether a special design is a good performer in waves or not lueders 1959 marshall 2002 ghadimi et al 2019a but the unsteady planing problem has a very complicated hydrodynamic nature which makes the understanding of the problem very hard compared to displacement hulls simulation of the dynamic of a planing surface is more challenging meyers et al 1981 tavakoli et al 2017 dynamic of planing hulls in waves fig 1 refers to unsteady motions of a vessel operating in planing mode ulstein and faltinsen 1996 waves induce motions to the vessel and vertical acceleration at the bow of the vessel is expected to be very high katayama et al 2000 riley et al 2012 since hydrodynamic pressure is the dominant contributor supporting the weight of the vessel ghadimi et al 2015 2019b hydrodynamic of a planing vessel highly differs from that of non planing vessels i e displacement hulls heave and pitch motions are expected to be strongly coupled ghadimi et al 2016a and the hydrodynamic coefficients of the vessel are reported to vary over the time since the pressure pattern is changed remarkably during a single cycle tavakoli et al 2018a judge 2014 from an early planing speed to a super planing speed the resonances of heave and pitch motions can be highly increased fridsma 1969 savitsky 1985 motions of planing hulls are observed to be nonlinear and second as well as third harmonics are expected to partially involve fridsma 1969 savitsky 1968 begovic et al 2014 increase in the wave steepness is seen to have a nonlinear relationship with the dynamic response which becomes more significant by the increase in speed experimental measurements have shown that the nonlinearities in heave and pitch responses can become very strong in randomized waves since a wider range of frequencies contributes begovic et al 2016 nonlinearities are found to be more noticeable in the vertical acceleration of the vessel in many cases the acceleration is seen to go beyond 2g hou et al 2019 vanderwerken and judge 2017 razola et al 2016 causing an uncomfortable riding situation such a large acceleration not only causes mental problems for the crews lo martire et al 2017 but also it can cause structural damages for the boat once it slams the water neuberg and drimer 2017 drimer et al 2017 some planing hulls may show unstable behaviour in waves since the exciting wave loads can lead to an increase of trim angle the mean value of pitch which in turn results in the high shift of the centre of pressure during each cycle sun and faltinsen 2011a such an unsteady change in the centre of pressure eventually leads to an unstable motion and the rider slows down the vessel the added resistance of a planing vessel is expected to be highly larger than the added resistance of displacement hulls fridsma 1971 induced drag which is caused by hydrodynamic pressure highly depends on the speed and trim angle of the vessel the latter which is expected be increased in waves model tests are known as the first but the most reliable method that can be used to explore the dynamic response of a planing hull in waves wilson et al 1981 dynamic response of the vessel is recorded and the added resistance can be measured the vessel is towed in a wave basin while waves are mechanically generated the tests may be very expensive since a model is needed to be constructed and different equipment is required for measurement of motion or generation of waves some early experiments can be found in the work of lueders 1959 which was performed in the late 1950s fridsma 1969 performed a systematic study on wave induced motions of prismatic planing hulls in regular waves his research formed the early knowledge about unsteady planing motion which showed that a second resonance can emerge in the pitch response of the vessel at high planing speeds his experiments were used for empirical prediction the added resistance and vertical acceleration later empirically based methods which take the advantage of the experimental data have been used for modelling of the performance of planing hulls in calm water savitsky 1964 morabito 2014 the main challenge in empirical modeling is to find the hydrodynamic force acting on the boat and the centre of the forces pennino et al 2018a while empirical models can provide the forces and moments the results are not reliable when the planing vessel has unsteady motions in an unsteady motion as mentioned earlier the heave and pitch responses of the vessel in resonance zone are severe and besides the mean pitch and heave are different from the dynamic trim angle and cg rise up of the vessel running attitudes of the calm water owing to nonlinear nature of the problem thus the results of empirical equations that provide us with hydrodynamic coefficients only provide frequency domain simulations since they are developed for a perfect linear condition e g in faltinsen 2005 the equations governing on the fluid field around a planing hull can be solved using ideal flow or viscous flow assumptions matveev 2018 when the fluid is assumed to be incompressible and viscosity is assumed to be nil fluid is supposed to have a single phase nature and it obeys the laplace equations newman 1977 the radiation and diffraction problems that provide the hydrodynamic fluid forces moments acting on the structure are needed to be solved greco et al 2004 while such an assumption is reliable for the case of ships it can be less accurate for the case of a planing hull especially at high froude numbers the unsteady planing problem is nonlinear boundary conditions can be nonlinear and the motions are remarkable garme and rosen 2003 also flow separation from the chine and transom of the vessel occurs necessitating the consideration of the kutta condition mccauley 2018 doctors 1985 therefore the unsteady planing problem is far from being linear and the equations are needed to be solved in the time domain sun and faltinsen 2011b some researchers have recently attempted to solve the unsteady planing problem in the frequency domain using green integrations lin and lin 2019 de jong 2011 but their simulations are limited to low froude numbers early pre planing mode to overcome the limitations associated with the idea flow assumption the 2d t method is used as known this method provides an opportunity for simplifying the three dimensional problem by reducing it to a 2d problem troesch 1992 the 2d problem provides the flow field around 2d v shaped bodies whcih are similar to the section of a deep v boat akers 1999 martin 1976 niazmand bilandi et al 2018a but the 3d problem should be solved in the time domain i e a water entry problem is solved tavakoli et al 2018b a wide range of solutions ranging from linear ones to nonlinear ones for the 2d wedge sections have been offered by different researchers readers interested in water entry are invited to see details of the water entry and different solutions in the paper published by tassin et al 2014 a mathematical model for prediction of the motions of planing hulls in monochromatic waves was developed by zarnick using the 2d t method and the classic solution of water entry of 2d wedge sections zarnick 1978 this research is known as the milestone of the unsteady planing simulation by many experts as it opened a wider option for the next generation of researchers many researchers took the opportunity to use zarnick s method to increase the accuracy of the motion predictions for planing hulls some authors on the other hand suggested to use more complicated solutions of water entry using boundary element method for simulation of the 2d problem in the time domain vorus 1996 haase 2015 but the classic solution which is based on the momentum variation is still more popular since it is very fast and as reliable as the other 2d solutions when they are used for dynamic motion simulation hicks 1995 the method has been recently used for modelling of roll motion ghadimi et al 2016b tavakoli et al 2015 asymmetric planing ghadimi et al 2017a xu et al 1999 vertical motion pennino et al 2018 and even manoeuvring of planing hulls dashtimanesh et al 2019 tavakoli and dashtimanesh 2017b 2019 one of the reasons that makes the method very popular is that it can be easily extended to other designs of planing vessels like the stepped boats niazmand bilandi et al 2018b 2019 di caterino et al 2018 while the method has been used for a long time but the level of the accuracy of the 2d t method has not been studied for example the values of added resistance of the vessel and the vertical accelerations obtained through 2d t method has been rarely compared against experimental data moreover the nonlinear behaviour of the model still is needed to be studied to show how the method works in modelling of the nonlinearities of the vessel in waves such studies indeed provide a meaningfull understanding of the model performance that can be used for improving its accuracy in the case the fluid is assumed to be viscous the shear stresses in addition to the pressure are supposed to contribute in generation of forces tezdogan et al 2015 they can have higher contribution at higher speeds since the fluid becomes more turbulent esfandiari et al 2019 simulation of the problem can only be performed using the viscous flow assumptions larsson et al 2013 computational fluid dynamics cfd allows us to discretize the governing equation on the fluid flow and solve them in the time domain stern et al 2015 the cfd codes are found to be reliable tools for modelling of the planing problems either steady or unsteady ones dashtimanesh et al 2018 de luca et al 2014 2016 mancini et al 2017 de marco et al 2017 but they can be time consuming since the fluid is needed to be turbulent and motions involve a longer time is needed for simulation of the problem a new generation of the research has been sparked up in the recent years mousaviraad et al 2015 niazmand bilandi et al 2020 dashtimanesh et al 2020 roshan et al 2020 jiang et al 2017 yang et al 2019 many researchers have used different turbulent models dynamic modules to simulate hydrodynamic of planing hulls most of the researches have shown that the overset technique and urans unsteady reynolds averaged naiver stokes are more accurate while these researches have increased the body of the knowledge in the modelling of the planing problem they have mostly focused on calm water performance i e cfd simulations are performed up to the time heave and pitch of a planing hull converge pennino et al 2016 the research centring on the dynamic motion simulations are scant most of the available published data are general for example they have presented heave and pitch raos response amplitude operators even without comparing the results with experimental data due to the lack of experimental data but they have not focused on the vertical acceleration time history of the motions and other nonlinear aspects of the planing problem simply stated the knowledge about the ability of cfd codes in the modelling of unsteady planing problem is still immature furthermore recently a new research field is started based on the idea that the high fidelity calculation for ship performance resistance self propulsion seakeeping and manoeuvring attitude with cfd codes is likely to be much more difficult to achieve especially due to the high computational effort required one way of alleviating these burdens is by constructing approximation models known as metamodels or surrogate models which are used to replace the specific simulation based a variety of metamodeling techniques have been successively developed e g artificial neural network response surface method and kriging method all of these approximated models after a validation stage are used to carry out a large amount of the tests and only a few points generally the critical ones are investigated by cfd simulations or experimental tests see for instance serani et al 2019 and diez et al 2019 in the current research different methods are used to model dynamic of a planing hull it is aimed to understand the differences between the results of experimental cfd and mathematical models which shows the quality of different simulations in various contexts of unsteady planing new experiments are performed in towing tank of the university of naples federico ii a cfd model is used to simulate the dynamic response of the vessel in vertical directions the 2d t method is used to provide time domain simulation for the dynamic of the vessel also it is aimed to take the advantageous of cfd simulations to explore the hydrodynamic pressure acting on the vessel by sampling the data the rest of the current paper is outlined as follows section 2 presents the details of the experimental model and the test plans the formulation for the 2d t method is reported in section 3 the set up for the cfd model and governing equations on the fluid problem are presented in section 4 the main results of the current paper are reported and discussed in section 5 quantitative comparison between the results of all models are performed and it is shown how accurate the cfd model and 2d t method can be conclusion remarks are described in section 6 a detailed overview of the 2d t is shown in appendix a a mesh study for the cfd model is performed which is presented in the appendix b formulation for computation of the resistance of the vessel are described in appendix c calm water performance of the vessel is also studied using all three models and the corresponding data are presented in appendix d 2 towing tank tests 2 1 the basin and the planing model experimental tests are performed in the towing tank of the university of naples federico ii table 1 this tank can be used for both calm water and seakeeping tests and is equipped with a wavemaker the tank is 137 m long and 9 m wide it is filled with fresh water with a depth of 4 25 m a view of the tank is shown in fig 2 a carriage with a maximum speed of 10 m s is used to tow the vessel the vessel is towed forward by forces applied at the centre of gravity and midship the hull motions heave and pitch motions have been acquired by qualisys motion system which is composed of three infrared cameras that sight spherical markers as shown in fig 3 two triaxial accelerometers are also positioned to have a direct measure of the vertical accelerations the first is placed at the center of gravity the second one at 0 5 l forward to the center of gravity the wave height is measured with two different methods the first is a static measurement based on the capacitive sensors placed at 71 86 m in the middle of the tank the second one is an onboard system composed of three ultrasonic probes the first and second one located in front of the model transversely at b 3 and b 3 the third one is positioned on the side of the model in the x coordinate of the centre of mass far from the model to overcome the influence of the wave generated by the hull the two different methods are used because of an accurate measurement of steep waves throughout capacitive probes which however can only be used on the poolside the usonic system can easily follow the model to measure directly the encountered wave the side usonic probe allows also to evaluate the wave phase the resistance of the vessel in waves is measured using a load cell located at the end of the controlled shaft more details about experimental settings and the towing tank can be found in bove et al 2019 a planing model made up of wood is constructed and tested in the towing tank the vessel is the c2s hull model of the warped hull naples systematic series de luca and pensa 2017 details of this planing hull are reported in table 2 the body lines of the model and a photo of the vessel resting in the calm water are shown in fig 3 calm water tests of this vessel have been recently carried out by de luca and pensa 2017 irregular wave tests on series have been carried out in de luca and pensa 2019 2 2 tests plans one dimensional unidirectional monochromatic regular waves are mechanically generated at one end of the basin as 1 η i n a i n sin ω i n t ε i n where ω i n refers to the frequency of the generated wave and a i n denotes the amplitude of the wave ε i n is the phase shift of the wave this wave is identified as the incoming i n wave gentle waves are generated to satisfy linear wave theory and to avoid wave breaking banner et al 2000 non breaking turbulence babanin 2006 and modulation instabilities galchenko et al 2010 thus the water surface elevation at any point with a longitudinal distance of x from the wave generator can be found using 2 η i n x t a i n cos k i n x ω i n t ε i n where k i n is the wave number and related to the wave frequency under the deep water dispersion equation as 3 ω i n 2 g k i n wave number and wave frequency are computed by 4 ω i n 2 π t i n and k i n 2 π λ i n where t i n and λ i n respectively refer to the wave period and wavelength the vessel is towed with the speed of u from the other end of the basin to physically simulate a head sea condition i e encounter angle of π the speed of the vessel is categorized in planing regime the beam froude number of the vessel is given by 5 f r b u g b 0 5 the encounter frequency the frequency of the excitation can be computed as 6 ω e ω i n k i n u cos χ where χ is the encounter angle χ π for the current research the plan for tests is shown in fig 4 the vessel is set to be free in heave and pitch directions but it is restrained in roll sway and yaw directions different waves are generated as shown in table 3 to induce vertical motions to the vessel note that the quality of the wave maker in the generation of the desired waves is evaluated and the water surface elevations at different points of the tank are measured using wave gauges and compared against airy theory the vessel is tested in the all conditions shown in table 3 at two different speeds of 3 5 m s corresponding to beam froude number of 1 78 and 4 5 m s corresponding to beam froude number of 2 25 a picture of the planing model towed in waves is shown in fig 5 3 mathematical model 3 1 governing equations the 2d t method is used to mathematically simulate the dynamic motion of the planing vessel in waves this model is formulated by assuming two coordinate systems each of which advances with the vessel speed u the body frame denoted with g x b y b z b lies on the cg of the vessel the hydrodynamic frame however settles on the calm water line the body frame can have vertical motions both linear and angular but the hydrodynamic frame can never have any oscillation in the vertical plane the governing equation on the vessel thus can be formulated as 7 m z f z w and i θ f θ where f z and f θ are respectively fluid force in heave direction and moment pitch direction the force and moment both contain all different mechanism including restoring damping added mass nonlinear and wave exciting contributors it is important to note that thrust force contribution is neglected in the current research to mathematically reproduce the experiments please note that in our experiments no thrust force acts on the vessel furthermore the effects of thrust force on heave and pitch motions of the vessel in waves are scant therefore we have not considered the effects of thrust force on motions 3 2 2d t method the 2d t method is developed by using a simple assumption that reduces the three dimensional unsteady planing problem to an unsophisticated 2d problem if it is assumed that the vessel passes through a transverse plane while it is oscillating in the vertical plane the unsteady planing is turned into a water entry problem more details about this method are exposed in appendix a 3 3 mathematical set up using the 2d t method explained briefly in appendix a the final motion equations of the vessel are formulated as 8 m m z z z m z θ θ f z m θ z z i m θ θ θ f θ where m i j is the added mass inertia of the vessel in the direction of i generated by the acceleration in the direction of j these added mass coefficients strongly depend on the wetted surface pattern of the vessel and differ over time and are computed by 9 m z z l r x b m d x b cos 2 θ 10 m z θ l r x b m x b d x b cos θ 11 m θ z l r x b m x b d x b cos θ 12 m θ θ l r x b m x b 2 d x b also the forces with a superscript refer to the fluid force excluding the added mass contribution given by 13 f z f z m z z z m z θ θ f θ f θ m θ z z m θ θ θ to solve the problem in the time domain an unknown vector is defined as 14 q z θ z θ the governing equations on the dynamic of the rigid body are then solved in the time domain using a runge kutta merson method the vessel is divided into a finite number of sections and added mass values their time derivative and the sectional forces are computed using the wetted surface pattern note that the resistance of the vessel is also computed details about the method for computing the resistance can be found in appendix b 4 cfd model 4 1 fluid flow the fluid flow is assumed to be viscous and two phase containing air and water to provide simulations with consideration of flow separation and shear stresses the air water flow is assumed to be incompressible in the whole domain the flow is turbulent and velocity and stresses are related by newtonian fluid law the fluid field is governed by incompressible navier stokes ns equations 15 v 0 t ρ m v ρ m vv μ m μ t v v t f b 0 where v v x x t v y x t v z x t is the velocity vector and p x t is the fluid pressure ρ m x t and μ m x t respectively show the density and viscosity of the mixture of water and air at any point in the domain μ t is the turbulent viscosity of the flow depending on the turbulence model f b is the body force generated by gravity the water air flow is simulated by applying the volume of fraction vof scheme shown by t which vary between 0 air and 1 water using t the effective value of any physical properties of the mixture of water and air is calculated as 16 φ m φ w t φ a 1 t to link t to the fluid equations a conservation equation is used 17 t t t v v r 1 t 0 where v r refers to the compression velocity of the interface between water and air the force f f x f y f z and moment m f φ f θ f ψ vectors are calculated by using the pressure and stresses τ 18 f s τ p i n d s 19 m s r r g τ p i n d s then the governing equations on the dynamic of the vessel equation 7 are solved by setting the vessel to be free in heave and pitch directions 4 2 numerical set up a sketch of the numerical domain is shown in fig 6 where dimensions and the boundaries are displayed the vessel initially has a velocity of u 0 a numerical wave generator is activated at the right end of the numerical domain monochromatic waves are generated at this boundary as 20 η i n a i n sin ω i n t ε i n which matches with the method used in the towing tank tests for the wave generation the wave then travels toward the vessel inducing vertical motions the accuracy of the numerically generated waves is evaluated by comparing the numerical data against the airy theory a numerical probe is lactated at a distance of 0 7l pp from the inlet and the water surface elevation is recorded as shown in the upper panel of fig 7 a sample of the time history of the numerically generated wave dashed green is displayed in the lower panel of fig 7 the results corresponding to the wave forcing of case 5 table 3 are compared against airy theory solid red as seen the numerical data and theoretical data fit showing that the cfd model has reliable accuracy in simulation of water waves please note that details about the numerical set up boundary conditions and mesh generation are explained later side surfaces of the domain are forced to behave as an inlet velocity having the speed of u which is set to be equal to the velocity of the vessel this boundary condition provides an open sea simulation but wave damping absorption is activated on the sides and on the outlet of the domain to avoid any wave reflection the side surfaces are set to be 2 5l pp far from the vessel the other end of the domain is prescribed to satisfy the neuman bc for all terms which provides a pressure outlet surface again waves are set to be absorbed in this boundary water is set to flow in the domain from the inlet surface with the velocity u an overset region is generated in the domain the body of the planing hull is attached to this region the overset region moves with the body in each time step the overset region is set to have a cubic shape with dimensions of 1 2 l 0 5 l 0 5 l note that the water depth is set to be height enough to satisfy the deep water condition all the domain dimensions are in line with all the best practices available ittc 2011 and the relevant papers in this field tezdogan et al 2015 de luca et al 2016 summary of bcs is reported in table 4 two grids are generated to model the dynamic motion of the vessel a background grid and an overset grid fig 8 the first represents the numerical domain and the second one contains the vessel and the region around it the coupling between the overset and background region is obtained by an interpolation scheme which is based on the distance weighted note that this method is known as the most robust scheme when large relative motions occur siemens plm software 2019 the cells near the water surface are set to be finer compared with the rest of the domain and are generated using trimmer anisotropic see details in siemens plm software 2019 four different grids table 5 are generated using a refinement ratio of 2 ittc 2011 to find the proper mesh that can be used for simulation of the problem a mesh independence study is carried out dynamic response of the vessel induced by regular wave is numerically simulated using each of these grids the results suggest that the fine grid g3 is the best option for the discretization of the domain to make the paper easier to follow the mesh study results are presented in appendix b 4 3 numerical approach the problem is numerically solved using a cfd code star ccm by plm siemens this cfd code discretizes the mass and momentum conservation equations using the finite volume method fvm the ns equations as well as the conservation of t are solved by using the simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations approach details of this approach can be found in most of cfd references siemens plm software 2019 andersson et al 2011 kajishima and taira 2017 the convection terms as well as the diffusion terms are turned into algebraic parameters using second order upwind and second order centred methods respectively the unsteady terms are discretized in the time domain by applying a second order backwards euler technique the μ t is found by implementing the k ε model details of which can be found in wilcox 1998 and siemens plm software 2019 the velocity field near the wall of the vessel is numerically modelled by the all wall y scheme so the y is set to be y 120 fig 9 according to the best practices suggested in ittc 2011 tezdogan et al 2015 and siemens plm software 2019 the dynamic equations are solved using a dynamic solver module known as pseudo compressibility approach tu et al 2018 siemens plm software 2019 the differential equations of the motion are discretized in the time domain and the acceleration speeds and displacements of the next time step are found the courant number cfl is set to be smaller than 0 5 during the simulations the selected time step satisfies the recommendations of the ittc 2011 i e one encounter period is solved during 100 time steps or more the second order temporal scheme is used to discretize the unsteady terms of the ns equations the initial pitch angle is set to be equal to the dynamic trim angle of the vessel similarly initial heave is set to be equal to the cg rise up of the vessel numerical simulations are performed in the time domain the early period of simulations in which the mean pitch and heave of the vessel significantly vary are ignored 5 results and discussion 5 1 heave and pitch motions samples of time histories of wave induced heave and pitch motions of the planing hull at two different wavelengths of 2 2l and 4 34l are respectively shown in fig 10 and fig 11 in all cases both motions are seen to be harmonic as expected the vessel experiences a greater number of cycles during each period t i n which agrees with theory the encounter angle is π head sea condition and thus the encounter frequency is larger than the frequency of the incoming wave the mean value of heave of the vessel is seen to be larger at the froude number of 2 28 which fits with the physics of problem i e cg rise up increases by the increase in speed at both wavelengths upper row of figs 10 and 11 the mean value of the pitch of the vessel is also seen to grow by the increase in speed as well the 2d t method does not properly follow the experimental data at the wavelength of 2 2l and beam froude number of 1 78 for example at the smaller speed 2d t computes a smaller amplitude for both heave and pitch motions at the higher speed the amplitude of heave and pitch motions computed by the 2d t method are comparable with experimental data but the mean heave and pitch found through 2d t simulations are larger than experiments the cfd data on the other hand shows more reliable behaviour that is cfd results agree with experimental data in most of the cases the only notable difference can be seen in the pitch response of the vessel at a higher speed compared to waves with λ i n 2 2 l 2d t method is observed to provide more accurate data for the case of incoming waves with λ i n 4 34 l especially at smaller speeds results are shown in fig 11 supports this fact the cfd model is still showing reliable behaviour for heave motion at λ i n 4 34 l but the pitch motion is seen to be computed with less accuracy at the higher beam froude number it is interesting to note that the value of mean heave and mean pitch at longer waves calculated using the 2d t method are more accurate compared to the shorter waves heave and pitch responses of the vessel are computed at all forcing conditions the responses are computed using a zero crossing method the difference between crest and trough of each cycle was found and then was divided over 2 the mean value of all cycles was then computed fig 12 displays the values of heave and pitch response of the vessel at two different beams froude numbers the results of all three models are presented in this figure to provide an understanding of their behaviours the data is also presented in table 6 heave response and table 7 pitch response the data measured in the towing tank tests show that heave and pitch motions of the vessel both show an over damping behaviour at both modelled speeds heave response is close to zero at very short waves and then converges to 1 0 at very long waves as expected i e at long waves the boat follows the motion of waves for the case of pitch response similar behaviour is observed the pitch response is very close to zero at the shortest wave and finally approaches the wave slope at the longest waves moreover heave and pitch responses increase by the increase in speed which agrees with the previous laboratory measurements of different researchers 2d t model provides similar behaviour results obtained by this model follows the experimental data but the accuracy of this model is not acceptable at wavelength varying between 2l to 3l the 2d t method is seen to under predict the results at this range of wavelengths compared with the 2d t method the cfd model is observed to provide more accurate data especially at the higher beam froude number at the smaller beam froude number the cfd model computes a very weak resonance for both heave and pitch motions at the wavelength of 2 2l a spectra analysis is carried out to evaluate the differences between models in more details fast fourier transform module of the matlab is used and the energy spectra of the time histories of different data are computed fig 13 shows the energy spectrum of heave and pitch motions of the vessel at the wavelength of 4 34l as seen the energy spectrum of the heave and pitch motions are nonlinear at smaller speeds left panels the energy is seen to emerge at both smaller and larger frequencies at this speed by the increase in speed the energy spectrum of both heave and pitch motions becomes linear and energy is focused at ω ω e 1 note that all three models result in similar behaviour at both speeds the energy spectrum of the heave and pitch motions at a wavelength of 2 2l is displayed in fig 14 as apparent the energy spectrums of both motions are linear at the smaller speeds which is in contrast with the results corresponding to the wavelength of 2 2l fig 13 the energy spectrum of the measured heave motion experimental model is seen to be linear at larger beam froude number but the energy spectrums resulted from the cfd and 2d t models are seen to be nonlinear for this speed the energy spectrum of the pitch motion of the vessel is seen to be strongly nonlinear at larger speed a large amount of energy has been seen to be shifted toward smaller frequency both simulations of the 2d t and cfd models predict such a nonlinear behaviour for pitch motion at this speed overall the results presented in figs 13 and 14 show that by the increase of beam froude number nonlinear motions occur at the smaller wavelength and the pitch motion of the vessel becomes more nonlinear compared to heave motion also cfd and 2d t models are seen to have reliable predictions at most of the cases they only failed to predict accurate energy spectrum for heave motion of the vessel at λ 2 2 l at higher beam froude number 5 2 vertical acceleration the vertical acceleration of the vessel at cg is computed using all three models samples of time histories of the vertical acceleration the vessel at cg are plotted in fig 15 and fig 16 the results presented in these two figures respectively correspond to the wavelengths of 2 2l and 4 34l as apparent in these figures vertical acceleration of the vessel is non linear i e each cycle is seen to be skewed toward the next cycle asymmetric shape and the trough of the cycle is sharp by the increase in speed nonlinearities increase that is trough becomes sharper and each cycle becomes more asymmetric for the case of a longer wave acceleration is seen to be smaller larger speed also is seen to result in larger acceleration note that the values of crest and trough of the vertical acceleration are not the same for instance the vessel is exposed to vertical accelerations of 0 42g and 0 48g at each cycle when it is operating at froude number of 2 28 and waves with λ i n 2 2 l long cfd data is seen to follow the experimental data in most of the cases the data computed using cfd fairly matches with experiments at the higher speed however cfd data is less nonlinear for example at froude number of 2 28 and wavelength of 2 2l the trough of the cfd is less skewed toward the next cycle the results computed through the 2d t simulations are seen to follow the data but they are less accurate compared to the cfd the crest is seen to be predicted with better accuracy but the errors in the prediction of the trough are more significant this shows that while 2d t computes smaller force when the vessel impacts the water interestingly this fact is consistent with what has been observed previously 2d t was seen to under predict the heave response which can be caused by a smaller force spectrums of the vertical acceleration at cg are computed using fft which can show nonlinear the acceleration is the experimental results presented in fig 17 and fig 18 reveal that vertical acceleration is strongly nonlinear at all speeds energy is distributed between two or more harmonics at higher beam froude number the value corresponding to two dominant harmonics are very close and small proportions of energy emerge at higher and smaller frequencies spectrums corresponding to 2d t and cfd results vertical acceleration at cg also show nonlinearities but they do not match with experimental results in all conditions when the vessel advances at smaller beam froude number both cfd and 2d t model predict the harmonics with more reliable accuracy at the higher speed the accuracy of both cfd and 2d t models in prediction of harmonics decrease vertical accelerations at cg computed by cfd and 2d t models are observed to be narrower compared to the experimental data more amount of energy is focused at the dominant frequency for the case of cfd and 2d t models at higher beam froude numbers for the case of long waves the accuracy of cfd is more reliable overall the presented spectrum results show that while the vertical acceleration of a planing hull is strongly nonlinear which becomes more significant by the increase in speed cfd and 2d t models cannot accurately compute nonlinearities at higher speeds the computed values for the vertical acceleration at cg are computed using a zero crossing method the difference between crest and trough is found and then divided by 2 fig 19 displays the values of vertical acceleration at cg obtained using three different models the values of vertical acceleration at cg are also presented in table 8 at the smaller speed as apparent two peaks one at 2 57l and one at 3 58l emerge at the higher speed again two peaks can be observed but the smaller peaks occur at a shorter wavelength compared to the smaller beam froude number the emergence of two peaks z c g g vs λ i n l plots confirms the nonlinearity of the motion the peak value corresponding to the longer wave λ i n 3 58 l obtained through experimental tests is seen to increase up to 0 15g by the increase in speed moreover experimentally measured vertical accelerations occurring around the peak value for example at 3 01l and 3 58l increase up to 0 3 0 4g by the increasing speed this fact shows that hydrodynamic pressure acting on the bottom of the vessel strongly affect the forces acting on the boat that is as the speed increases hydrodynamic pressure becomes more dominant leading to larger force and vertical acceleration the results of the cfd model are seen to follow experimental data at a smaller speed also cfd data fairly with experimental data at a smaller speed at the higher speed the cfd model has reliable accuracy at shorter waves but its accuracy decreases by the increase in wavelength the 2d t model is seen to follow the experimental data at both speeds but it highly under predicts the value of vertical acceleration at all cases except very small waves results of the 2d t model show that while the cfd model can provide nonlinear results it under predicts the vertical forces acting on the vessel such an under prediction agrees with the results presented in fig 12 the maximum value of the vertical acceleration occurs at the trough as was observed in figs 15 and 16 its value shown by z m a x is found for all forcing conditions and presented in fig 20 the results presented in this fig show that the behaviour of z m a x vs λ i n l is similar to that of z c g vs λ i n l in all cases peaks occur at similar wavelengths but the value of z m a x is partially larger compared to z c g at all cases such a difference is in consistence with what was observed in the presented time histories for z c g some researchers have previously discussed the poor accuracy of the 2d t model in prediction of the vertical acceleration according to what was observed here it can be suggested that an accurate water exit model is required to be used for computation of the forces acting on a planing vessel to predict the acceleration of the vessel with better accuracy 5 3 resistance in waves the resistance of the vessel in waves is also computed using both cfd and 2d t models the value of resistance is also measured during the experiments using a cell load located at the forward end of the controlled shaft see de luca and pensa 2019 the resistance of the vessel as expected has shown harmonic behaviour a sample of the time history of the resistance in waves is shown in fig 21 where cfd and 2d t results are following the experimental data mean values of all data fairly agree experimental data however reach the larger crest and the smallest trough in each cycle there might be different reasons for such behaviour one of the main reasons is the method used for measuring resistance the vessel is oscillating in vertical directions with larger vertical acceleration that can cause differences when resistance reaches its highest and smallest values the fluctuations emerged in the resistance plot also confirm this point but the mean values agree as mentioned earlier the mean value of the resistance of the vessel in waves is computed for all cases and then scattered in fig 22 the results presented in this figure show that the mean resistance of the vessel in waves differs from one wavelength to another which agrees with the physics of ship behaviour in rough waves a peak value occurs at the wavelength of 1 34l resistance in waves converges to zero when waves get longer at both speeds this behaviour for resistance in essence is in agreement with the physics of wave structure interaction theoretically the drift force the wave induced force which contributes to resistance of the vessel operating in waves caused in wave direction is nil when waves are long aranha 1994 increase in the speed of the vessel leads in the increment of the resistance in waves at all forcing conditions which is in consistence with reality that is the resistance of the vessel is expected to increase by the increase in speed the reported data for calm water performance of the vessel shows this fact appendix d the peak of resistance which emerges at the wavelength of 1 34l is increased up to 17 3 by the increase in speed the cfd and 2d t results agree are in fair agreement with experimental data which proves that both models are reliable enough to be used for computation of the resistance of the vessel in waves please note that the data corresponding to the resistance of the vessel is also reported in table 9 5 4 hydrodynamic pressure hydrodynamic pressure acting on the bottom of the vessel is sampled in numerical simulations the results corresponding to the wavelengths of 2 2l and 4 34l are reported in this section these results can help us to understand the physics of an unsteady planing motion in more details note that the hydrodynamic pressure is sampled at four different instants covering a half cycle during which vessel moves upward from its mean heave to maximum and then it moves downward again results corresponding to the beam froude numbers of 1 78 and 2 28 are presented in fig 23 and fig 24 respectively a longitudinal snapshot is also shown in which the boat position and water surface around the vessel can be seen as seen a transom suction occurs behind the stern of the vessel showing that when a vessel moves at planing range in rough waves transom waves occur like steady motion the pressure is seen to be zero at the transom and chines of the vessel which agrees with physics of planing in steady condition also such conditions are in agreement with 2d t assumptions where zero pressure is set on chines and transom of the vessel when the vessel moves upward pushed up by waves high pressure appears at the intersection of the water with the keel this pressure is larger when waves are 2 2l long as the vessel reaches a higher vertical position peak pressure increases and also pressure at stagnation line increases note that at this stage of the motion instant pitch of the vessel is higher compared to the previous stage at the next stages vessel locates at higher heave and pitch the distribution of pressure on the maximum pressure line also known as stagnation line demonstrates that the pressure near chine becomes larger for the waves with the longer length the pressure is seen to be larger at this stage at the final stage the vessel reaches its maximum heave and then tends to move downward interestingly larger pressure occurs near the transom at the stagnation line which is significant for the case of long waves such behaviour for hydrodynamic pressure is observed for both speeds but at a higher speed the pressure is larger as expected it is very important to note that during this half cycle the wetted surface of the vessel decreases and becomes thinner overall as a planing hull operates in a head sea maximum pressure appears at the intersection of the keel with water when the vessel locates at its mean pitch maximum pressure which occurs at stagnation line moves towards chine as the vessel moves upward if waves are longer maximum pressure will be smaller when the vessel is located at the mean heave but as the vessel moves upward the maximum pressure corresponding to longer waves becomes higher 5 5 sectional forces comparison between cfd and 2d t results as it was seen the results found through cfd simulation and the current 2d t method do not agree in all forcing conditions especially for the case of vertical acceleration to understand the reason for the differences sectional forces found by both models are compared against each other the results are displayed in fig 25 through 28 in each figure four panels are illustrated each of which corresponds to an instant the upper panels refer to the time steps during which the vessel is moving downward heave speed is negative identified by and the lower ones refer to the times vessel is moving upward as seen in all figures when the vessel moves downward upper panels the sectional force increases by the increase in distance from the bow and reaches a peak value then it decreases and reaches a second peak finally it vanishes at the transom which meets the real physics kutta condition cfd results black solid and the data found by the current 2d t method red dashed provide the evidences for this fact at the next stage as the vessel moves upward lower panels the sectional force is seen to have one peak in most of the cases in this condition fig 25 λ i n 2 2 l and 26 λ i n 1 1 l show the data corresponding to the froude number of 1 78 as apparat when the vessel advances in waves with a length of λ i n 2 2 l the sectional forces computed by the current 2d t method are smaller compared to the values given by cfd at most of the sections the peak values of the force computed by the current 2d t model however are found to be slightly larger compared to the cfd data in most of the cases in the forcing condition of λ i n 1 1 l the 2d t method has seen to compute negative sectional force in the vicinity of the bow of the vessel when it is moving upward during the phases the vessel is moving downward the negative force computed by 2d t method is seen to disappear upper row of fig 26 but compared to the data computed by the cfd model the method has seen to give smaller sectional forces when its moving downward upper panels the high change from negative sectional force to positive sectional forces computed by the current 2d t model can lead to the high difference between crest and trough of vertical force acting on the vessel in a cycle therefore the current 2d t method computes a larger vertical acceleration at short waves as it was observed and discussed earlier see fig 19 the data corresponding to the froude number of 2 28 is shown in figs 27 λ i n 2 2 l and 28 λ i n 1 1 l again compared to the results found by cfd simulations the 2d t method is seen to compute smaller sectional forces at most of the sections of the vessel when waves are 2 2 l long no negative sectional force is given by the 2d t method at the phases vessel is exiting the water but for the cases of the shorter waves λ i n 1 1 l negative sectional forces are found to emerge near the bow of the vessel as it exits the water this shows that like the lower speed corresponding to the beam froude number of 1 78 negative sectional forces appear when the vessel moves upward in short waves this fact shows that the main reason that manages the current 2d t method to over predict the short wave induced vertical acceleration is the negative sectional forces computed on the other hand under the action of longer waves like λ i n 2 2 l sectional force is found to be smaller than the values computed by cfd which is seen to lead to under prediction of the vertical acceleration overall while the current 2d t model which is based on the momentum variation can provide reliable data for heave and pitch motions there are still doubts about its ability in computing the sectional forces in short waves therefore other methods like vorus 1996 can be used for computation of sectional forces in near future proving us with a better understanding of the force distribution on a planing hull advancing in waves especially short waves 6 conclusion dynamic of a hard chine planing hull was studied using three different models it was aimed to explore the differences between the results of each of these models and to improve understanding of unsteady planing motion the vessel was firstly modelled in towing tank and its motions as well as resistance were measured in head sea condition then mathematical simulations using the 2d t model were performed and heave and pitch responses as well as resistance were found at the final stage a cfd model was utilized to reproduce the experiments in a numerical wave tank heave and pitch of the vessel were observed to be nonlinear in some cases pitch of the vessel was seen to be strongly nonlinear at the wavelength of 2l and higher beam froude number at longer waves λ i n 4 l heave and pitch motions were found to show a weak nonlinear behaviour both cfd and 2d t method provided reliable data for nonlinearity except for the pitch motion at high speed the amplitudes of heave and pitch motions of the studied planing hull were observed to be over damped at both considered speeds it was seen that the cfd data heave and pitch responses and the results obtained from the 2d t simulations follow the experimental results but it was demonstrated that the 2d t method under predicts the heave and pitch response this under prediction was demonstrated to be significant at 2 l λ i n 4 l the heave and pitch responsesfound by cfd model were observed to be smaller than the experimentally measured data at long waves the increase in the speed was seen to result in larger heave and pitch responses as expected the vertical acceleration of the vessel at cg was found to be nonlinear which becomes stronger by the increase in speed the spectrum of the vertical acceleration was seen to emerge at a greater number of harmonics at longer waves it was demonstrated that while cfd and 2d t methods can provide nonlinear behaviour for vertical acceleration they cannot follow the experimental data both cfd and 2d t models provided larger energy for ω ω e and smaller energy for ω ω e overall cfd and 2d t methods provide a weaker nonlinear response for the vertical acceleration at cg the amplitude of vertical acceleration at different forcing condition was investigated it was shown that two peaks occur in the z c g vs λ i n l plots the peak corresponding to the longer wave was found to increase by the increase in speed while the other one was seen to be decreased also the peak of z c g corresponding to shorter waves was seen to emerge at waves with smaller λ i n by the increase in speed 2d t method was seen to under predict the amplitude of vertical acceleration at waves with moderate and long waves but over predict vertical acceleration at short waves cfd data provided reliable simulations at smaller speed but at the higher speed the cfd data were seen to converge from the experimental data at long waves which can be attributed to the weaker nonlinear response computed by the model the resistance of the vessel in the wave was seen to reach a peak at λ i n 1 34 l and increases by the increase in speed the results obtained using the 2d t method and cfd model were shown to be in fair agreement with experimental data hydrodynamic pressure computed using the cfd model was sampled for different forcing conditions it was seen that when the vessel comes out of the water the pressure acting on the stagnation line starts to become larger near chine it was demonstrated that when waves are longer maximum pressure is larger which emerges near chines on the stagnation line at the phase the vessel reaches its highest vertical position but when the vessel locates at its mean heave the maximum pressure which appears on the intersection of the water and keel corresponding to the waves with moderate lengths λ i n 2 2 l is higher also the pressure area of the vessel was seen to be smaller at λ i n 2 2 l compared to the longer waves λ i n 4 34 l sectional forces computed by 2d t and cfd models were sampled it was shown that when waves are short e g λ i n 1 1 l negative sectional forces might be computed by 2d t method especially when the vessel is exiting the water which can be one of the main reason that the 2d t model over predicts the vertical acceleration at short waves at moderate waves e g λ i n 2 2 l however current 2d t model was seen to compute smaller sectional forces compared to cfd model which is in consistence with computed values of vertical acceleration at that range of wavelengths i e compared to cfd the current 2d t model computes smaller vertical acceleration at long waves to sum the dynamic motion of a planing hull is strongly nonlinear which becomes stronger by the increase in the speed nonlinearities corresponding to the vertical acceleration are significant the cfd and 2d t method can compute nonlinear behaviour at the early planing speed but by the increase in speed their results become less reliable they can still provide acceptable accuracy for the heave and pitch responses at different wavelengths 2d t method however can have larger errors at wavelengths of 2l 3l these errors are linked to the errors occurring in the computation of the forces acting on the vessel the 2d t method can under predict the vertical force acting on the boat in waves especially when the vessel is exiting the water and waves are short more accurate solution of the water entry and water exit problems are required to be implemented in the model to improve its quality it is important to note that a 2d t method is a reliable tool that can be used in the simulation of the dynamic motion of boats and modifying its accuracy can be very helpful in the early stage design of planing hulls cfd model is shown to be a reliable hydrodynamic tool in the simulation of the motion but there might be some errors in the prediction of the acceleration at long waves since it cannot simulate the real physics strong nonlinear behaviour of the vertical acceleration of the motion in the future deeper studies are required to be carried out to increase the accuracy of the cfd model in the prediction of the vertical acceleration for instance the recent application of the adaptive mesh refinement technique could be a promising way to enhance the accuracy of the cfd especially in the mesh discretization in particular for the strong non linear cases finally the 2d t method could be used to develop metamodels or surrogated models combined with a few numbers of check points performed with high fidelity cfd simulations to obtain a fast or eventually real time method for early stage analysis or fast craft behaviour simulation credit authorship contribution statement sasan tavakoli conceptualization

the development of the model are not presented here to make the paper easier to follow see fig 29 appendix b grid study for the cfd model a grid study is carried out to select the most appropriate mesh that can be used for numerical experiments cfd modelling the dynamic response of the vessel induced by a wave with λ i n 3 58 l is simulated for the considered planing hull at beam froude number of 2 28 simulations are run for all four generated grids the results obtained through numerical simulations suggest that the fine grid which contains 1 384 million of cells is the best option that can be used for simulations results are shown in fig 30 confirms that the results heave response converge for this grid note that all the cfd data shown in section 5 of the paper are computed using grid 3

details about the measurements of running attitudes dynamic trim angle and cg rise up and the resistance can be found in de luca and pensa 2017 both the cfd model and 2d t methods are also used to compute the performance of the vessel in calm water condition the wave amplitude is set to be zero and then the simulations have been carried out up to the time heave and pitch converge to constant values these constant values of heave and pitch are respectively set to be cg rise up and dynamic trim angle of the vessel fig 31 shows samples of the convergence of data for both cfd blue dashed plot

21446,the ultimate strength of six stiffened columns under axial compressive loading are studied by experimental and numerical methods the web local buckling mode observed in specimens is analyzed based on the measured strain and displacement during the test the effects of measured stress strain curve and elastic perfectly plastic curve of material to the ultimate strength of specimens are investigated by numerical calculations the simply supported boundaries at the loaded edges and free boundaries at unloaded edges were produced based on the horizontal test fixture the initial geometrical imperfections were measured and tensile tests with different thicknesses were conducted to get the true stress strain curve the strain gauges and displacement meters were installed to analyze the failure modes and it indicated that the local web buckling occurred first and dominated the collapse the ultimate strength calculated by numerical analysis reaches a good agreement with experimental results the ultimate strength calculated with the elastic perfectly plastic curve is approximately 10 larger than that with the true stress strain curve it indicates that the elastic perfectly plastic material constitutive model will not always overestimate the ultimate strength as the non linear property between the proportional limit stress and 0 2 proof stress of material would reduce the ultimate strength keywords stiffened column compressive test ultimate strength material constitutive model local web buckling 1 introduction the stiffened columns are the fundamental components of ships and offshore structures and several continuous stiffened columns come together to be the stiffened panels which are the significant structures in hull girders the ultimate limit state design is adopted to assess the safety margin of ships widely the vertical ultimate bending strength of the hull girder is one of the most important strength design criteria and it is studied by numerical calculations and ultimate bending strength tests wang et al 2019 xu et al 2019 fully the in plane compressive loading especially in deck and bottom could be caused by vertical bending moment as a result the ultimate strength of the stiffened column subjected to axial in plane compression plays an important part in ship structural design and several researchers have studied it in the past non linear finite element method fem was widely used to evaluate the ultimate strength of structures tanaka et al 2014 paik et al 2008 and the influence factors such as boundary conditions xu et al 2013 collapse modes initial imperfections khedmati et al 2014 were taken into account zhang and khan 2009 proposed a semi analytical formula to evaluate the ultimate strength of stiffened panels and the results were verified with several stiffened panels calculated by abaqus non linear fe software based on a large number of numerical simulations kim et al 2017 and xu et al 2018 proposed the empirical formulations for simplified calculation of ultimate strength respectively however due to the complexity of variables in real stiffened columns the modeling parameters used in numerical analysis and theoretical calculations are usually simplified for example the initial geometrical deformation was reduced to defined shapes and amplitudes without randomness kim et al 2018 the true stress strain curves of the material were almost simplified to elastic perfectly plastic model tanaka et al 2014 or bi linear elastic plastic model ghavami and khedmati 2006 which only contains three parameters young s modulus yield stress and strain hardening rate as a result although the experimental method is more expensive and exhausting it is a good way to study the ultimate strength of stiffened columns and get useful conclusions several uniaxial compressive tests have been done on stiffened panels in the past sheikh et al 2003 carried out compression and bending tests on stiffened steel plates with t shape stiffeners and the test results have shown that a sharp drop of load carrying capacity took place after ultimate strength in stiffener tripping failure and a slow decline occurred in plate buckling collapse ten stiffened panels which have three flat bar stiffeners with the extent of three longitudinal span and one transverse bay were tested by tanaka and endo 1988 under compressive loading and brackets were used on side span to guarantee the collapse location at middle span ghavami 1994 tested 17 stiffened panels with one or two stiffeners and three types of longitudinal stiffeners including flat bar angel bar and tee bar one two and three spans in the longitudinal extent of specimens were considered and four simply supported boundaries were produced ghavami and khedmati 2006 took initial geometrical imperfections and bi linear behavior for the material with the strain hardening rate of e 65 into account and considered that the fe numerical calculations could get a good result with the test results three bay stiffened panels under axial compression until collapse were tested and some of them collapsed at the side bay gordo and soares 2011 xu and guedes soares 2013a tested five narrow stiffened panels which has two flat bar stiffeners and the longitudinal extent of 1 2 1 1 2 span was adopted to avoid side span collapse five wide stiffened panels with four stiffeners under uniaxial compression were also tested and the collapse took place in the middle bay for all specimens xu and guedes soares 2013b ten stiffened plates with flat bar or t bar stiffener were tested to verify the minimum stiffness requirements and one longitudinal span was adopted with simply supported boundary conditions at loaded edges choi et al 2009 typical stiffened plates with openings were tested and both the ultimate strength and collapse modes in the test were similar to the results from the numerical calculation by fe analysis cui and wang 2020 the buckling collapse modes of specimens in the previous tests mainly focused on the beam column collapse or tripping of stiffener the web buckling of stiffened columns was observed obviously as the primary and dominant buckling mode in this test besides the true stress strain curves of high tensile steel for making specimens showed the non linear property between the proportional limit stress and 0 2 proof stress the effects of the non linear part to the ultimate strength of specimens could be studied in this test as the proportional limit stress was often close to the yield stress in the stress strain curves of steel in the previous tests in this paper six stiffened columns were tested under axial compression to study the ultimate strength and buckling collapse modes the simply supported boundaries at the loaded edges and free boundaries at unloaded edges were produced based on the horizontal test fixture the initial geometrical imperfections on flange web and attached plating were measured and tensile tests of high tensile steel used in the specimens with different thicknesses were conducted to get the true stress strain curve the strain gauges and displacement meters were installed to study the failure modes the ultimate strength calculated by fe analysis with taking the true stress strain curves average measured thickness and measured initial geometrical deformations into account is compared with the results in the test both the true stress strain curve and elastic perfectly plastic curve are used in finite element analysis to study the influence of the material constitutive model as the elastic perfectly plastic curve is widely used in numerical calculations 2 experimental setup in this test the simply supported boundary conditions were adopted at loaded edges and free boundaries were used along the long edges of the attached plating the boundary conditions were always difficult to designed and simulated as same as the real ones of continuous stiffened panels in ship structures the conditions at frames for continuous stiffened panels were between simply supports and clamped supports and the symmetric or anti symmetric conditions were employed along the centerline of the local attached plating choi et al 2009 although the boundary conditions of specimens were different from that in the continuous stiffened panel and the simply supports at loaded edges and the free supports at unloaded edges would give a lower result than true the boundary conditions of specimens used in fe analysis were the same with that in test and could reflect the real ultimate strength of the specimen in addition both the effects of the material constitutive models and the web local buckling collapse modes were shown in the test with current conditions 2 1 horizontal test setup the uniaxial compressive tests for stiffened columns were performed with a 200 ton hydraulic press and a horizontal testing fixture was designed and manufactured as shown in fig 1 the test fixture consists of an outer frame a steel plate with equally distributed screw hole two supporting piers with steel cover plate a load transfer beam two axes of rotation with steel plate four point contact supports and two lengthened cushion block for different length of specimens the steel plates with a thickness of 30 mm were widely used in the structures of fixtures to guarantee that the fixture has sufficient rigidity and the smallest deformation during the test process the top and side views of the schematic illustration of the whole test fixture are shown in fig 2 the loading center was set in the neutral axis of the cross section of the specimen to avoid additional bending moment and unintended transverse forces as shown in fig 2 b the steel plate on the axis of rotation and endplate of specimens was tied by four bolts to keep contact fully the diameter of through holes on the aforementioned structures was 20 mm and m16 bolts were used to make sure that the assembly could be done successfully the height of specimens was adjusted carefully to fit the designed loading center during the installation as the gaps existed between eight pairs of bolts and corresponding through holes would result in additional bending moment and reduce the ultimate compressive strength of specimens by doing this the negative effects of gaps were minimized in the test the axis of rotation with steel plates and the point contact supports are given in fig 3 the steel circular shafts with a diameter of 30 mm were separately welded on the two aforementioned structures as a result the point contact was produced by two crossed steel circular shafts to reduce frictional force applied by the horizontal loading the load control was used on the hydraulic press and the loading speed with 25 kn per min was adopted to keep that the loading procedure was a quasi static process the data of load and displacement were recorded in the whole loading and unloading process and the sampling frequency of 10 hz was adequate as the loading sampling interval was 0 042 kn 2 2 specimens of stiffened column the specimens of stiffened columns which are the basic unit of stiffened plates is combined by a tee bar stiffener and its attached plating based on stiffened columns the effects of different material constitutive models could be studied while relative conclusions would be promoted to the calculations of stiffened plates besides the buckling modes in the basic unit of stiffened plates which is web buckling in this test would be analyzed as the fundamental study about the buckling β b t p σ y e modes the height and thickness of the web were 200 mm and 3 mm and expressed with hw and tw respectively the breadth and thickness of flange were 80 mm and 5 mm and expressed with bf and tf respectively two important parameters namely plate slenderness ratio β and stiffener slenderness ratio λ include not only the geometrical sizes of stiffened panels but also material properties and the close relationship between the two parameters and ultimate strength have been proved in many previous studies zhang 2016 xu et al 2018 the two parameters are defined as follows 1 plate slenderness ratio β b t p σ e 2 stiffener slenderness ratio λ a r σ y e 3 radius of gyration r i a where i and a are moment of inertia and area of the stiffener cross section with attached plating based on the structures at the mid ship region of 12 double hull oil tankers and 10 bulk carriers zhang 2016 concluded that β was between 1 0 and 2 5 and λ was between 0 25 and 0 95 according to the existing british warships smith 1975 summarized that β was between 1 0 and 4 5 and λ was between 0 15 and 0 90 besides the number of stiffeners had small effects on the ultimate strength of stiffened plates on the condition that λ was less than or equal to 0 6 ozdemir et al 2018 in this study the plate slenderness ratio of specimens was designed with 1 9 and 2 8 and the stiffener slenderness ratio was from 0 19 to 0 29 both of plate slenderness ratio and stiffener slenderness ratio were in the aforementioned ranges two end attached plating with the thickness of 10 mm were welded to the loading edges of specimens respectively and were used to tie to the steel plate on the axis of rotation for carrying out the free rotation of simply supports boundary conditions it could also keep the loading edges as a plane to reduce the asymmetric loading as the gap between the stiffener and supported steel block would unexpected lower ultimate strength xu and guedes soares 2013a six specimens in this experiment were named by a combination of numbers and letters to distinguish from each other t1b2l1 the name of specimens is shown as an example to explain the meanings of numbers and letters t and subsequent 1 mean one t bar two kinds of breadth of the attached plating were adopted as 200 mm and 300 mm and the notation b2 and b3 were used respectively three longitudinal length of specimens without the thickness of end attached plating were designed as 1000 mm 1200 mm and 1500 mm and the abbreviations l1 l12 and l15 were employed the cross section of specimens is shown in fig 4 and typical specimens t1b3l15 is given in fig 5 the geometrical sizes of specimens and their code name are illustrated in table 1 the notation a bp and tp are the longitudinal length of specimens without the thickness of the end attached plating breadth and thickness of the attached plating respectively 2 3 strain gauges and displacement meters twenty four strain gauges were used in a specimen six of them were set on the upper surface of the flange nine and three of them were installed on the upper and lower surfaces of the attached plating respectively the other six strain gauges were used on the symmetric locations on both the two side surfaces of the web in the longitudinal direction three sections in a quarter a half and three quarters of the length were selected to install strain gauges and they were represented with the notation l1 4 l1 2 and l3 4 respectively and the section l1 4 was closed to the hydraulic press the distribution of gauges is illustrated in fig 6 and the marked circle is used to represent the strain gauge the notation s plus number and ul are used to represent the measured location of strain and out of plane displacement respectively 3 material tensile test and measurement of initial geometrical imperfection 3 1 material tensile test the attached plating and flange in the stiffened column were made of the nominal 5 mm thick high tensile steel plate t5 and the web was made of nominal 3 mm thick high tensile steel plate t3 the measured average thickness of t3 and t5 were 3 0 mm and 5 3 mm and that were used in numerical calculations in fe analysis the material used for tensile specimens and corresponding components in the stiffened column were in the same plate to get the accurate material stress strain curve the tensile specimens were designed according to gb t 228 1 2010 the tensile test with a steady loading velocity is 3 mm per min was carried out to get the mechanical properties of the material the material tensile testing machine with extensometer and specimens at fracture are shown in fig 7 the engineering stress strain curves of t3 and t5 high tensile steel are shown in fig 8 the true stress strain curves of material which were used in non linear fe analysis were obtain based on eq 4 and given in fig 8 4 ε t r u e ln 1 ε e n g σ t r u e σ e n g 1 ε e n g the young s modulus e and poisson s ratio are equal to 200 gpa and 0 3 respectively the proportional limit stress σ p 0 2 proof stress σ p 0 2 and the ultimate tensile stress σ m of t3 and t5 are illustrated in table 2 3 2 measurement of initial geometrical imperfection initial imperfections produced in the process of fabrications and manufactures such as initial deflections are unavoidable as the initial geometrical deflections would decrease the compressive rigidity and ultimate strength of the stiffened columns the measurements were carried out carefully after the pre loading which was used to release the residual stress based on the latest dynamic gauge points tracking image technology the initial geometrical deflections in the attached plating web and flange were measured by hand held laser scanning system as shown in fig 9 several anchor points were fixed on the objective plates and then the coordinates of the surface of the plate can be obtained by the hand held laser scanning system with a scanning density of 10 mm 10 mm the measured initial deflections of specimen t1b2l12 and t1b3l12 are illustrated as examples in fig 10 moreover the measured initial imperfections are the actual deflections including local and global parts take the flange of t1b2l12 as an example there are both local deflections and global single half wave deflection along the longitudinal direction which is shown obviously in the intersecting line of flange and web in fig 10 c 4 experimental results 4 1 ultimate strength six specimens were tested under axial compression by a 200 ton hydraulic press and a horizontal test fixture the loading speed with 25 kn per min was adopted and the data of loading and displacement was recorded in the loading process pre loading was carried out to reduce the gaps in the whole test fixture the amplitude of pre loading was 100 kn and the maximum stress in specimens was about 50 mpa to guarantee that the material was still in elastic stage in this pre loading cycle the force and strain were recorded during loading after that formal loading was started until the ultimate strength of specimens was reached then the forced end shortening continued to be applied by the hydraulic press until the reaction force reducing to approximately 80 of ultimate strength finally the displacement was reduced and permanent deformations after the collapse were produced on specimens the load displacement curves of specimens are shown in fig 11 and the ultimate strength is given in table 3 in the initial loading stage namely end shortening increasing from zero to approximately 2 mm the amount of increase in applied force was small the reason was that some gaps existed between specimens and each part in the horizontal test setup and the hydraulic press when contacts were fully made with the increasing of force the load displacement relationship of specimens reached into the linear growth process this phenomenon has also been seen in other experiments xu and guedes soares 2013a the rigidity and ultimate strength of t1b3l12 were lower than that of the others as shown in fig 11 the probable cause was that the height of the loading center was not in the neutral axis of the cross section of the specimen as the initial geometrical deformations of t1b3l12 were large and the effects of 4 mm gap between m16 bolts and 20 mm diameter of through holes couldn t be minimum in the assembling process 4 2 buckling collapse modes the twenty four strain gauges and three displacement meters as shown in fig 6 were installed in specimens to analyze the buckling collapse modes the measured point s1 s2 s3 s1 s2 and s3 were on the attached plating and s1 and s1 were on the upper and lower surfaces of the same location the point s4 and s5 were on the left and right surfaces of the web in the same location to study the local buckling the s6 and s7 were on the upper surface of the flange and close to the two free boundaries respectively in addition the measured strain data conversed with corresponding stress based on the engineering stress strain curves of high tensile steel in fig 8 the changing of stress and out of plane displacement were analyzed to study the buckling sequence of local structures and buckling collapse modes 4 2 1 t1b2l1 the ultimate strength of specimen t1b2l1 was 598 5 kn and then unload to 400 kn the measured data is shown in fig 12 and fig 13 the relationship between the compressive stress and load was almost linear in the initial phase moreover the compressive stresses in a symmetrical position such as s6 and s7 in section l1 4 were not same but linear to the applied load the reason was that the symmetry of specimens was not very good as the machining precision and initial imperfections could not be controlled precisely with the applied load increasing to about 200 kn the phenomena that one of the measured stress s4 or s5 was unloading and the other one entered into accelerated growth stage were illustrated in the three sections of the specimen at the same time no unloading took place on the attached plating and flange from this we can see that local web buckling occurred first and it developed fast with the increasing of applied load with the applied load increasing to about 400 kn the stress of s6 and s7 in flange started to make a difference it indicated that the out of plane deformation of flange occurred the buckling in flange was mainly affected by the adjacent deformation on the web due to the high local buckling strength of flange moreover the unloading of stress in attached plating occur first in position s3 of section l1 4 it implied that the location of collapse might be near this section as the load increased to 500 kn the difference between s4 and s5 in web reached a high level essentially in section l1 4 the out of plane displacements on the center of the web of in this section increased rapidly as given in fig 13 b moreover the stress in attached plating came into an accelerated growth stage when the specimen achieved maximum loading capacity namely 598 5 kn the largest bifurcation took place in web and the obvious web buckling collapse resulted in the loss of structural loading capacity the stress of most parts in attached plating exceeded 0 2 proof stress of material and the structures collapsed with yielding it indicated that both buckling and yield leaded to the collapse of specimen moreover there was no unloading in point s2 and s2 of three sections which was in the junction line of web and attached plating it implied that no global flexible deformation took place the permanent deformation produced after unloading is illustrated in fig 14 it was obvious that the maximum out of plane deformation occurred on the web between the loading edge and section l1 4 and there was a small deformation on the adjacent flange and attached plating the collapse location was consistent with the analysis of aforementioned the changing law of stresses and displacement in web 4 2 2 t1b2l12 the measured stress and out of plane displacement on the web were shown in fig 15 and fig 16 and the ultimate strength of the specimen was 619 4 kn the length of specimen t1b2l12 was 20 larger than t1b2l1 and the transverse sections of two specimens were same the local web buckling still occurred first based on that the bifurcation of stresses on the web of three sections came into being first as the applied load was about 200 kn the bifurcation of two measured stresses in the flange of section l1 4 namely s6 and s7 took place as the applied load was equal to about 500 kn however this phenomenon was not shown in the two other sections it implied that the out of plane deformation of flange only took place in section l1 4 as the applied load exceeding 500 kn the growth of compressive stresses in attached plating accelerated and the structures entered into the plastic stage in the ultimate limit state at the same time the obvious increasing of out of plane displacements on the web is shown in fig 16 b in addition the measured displacement especially in l3 4 became very large during unloading it was due to that the longitudinal end shortening of specimen increased and the longitudinal location of displacement meters remained the same as given in fig 17 the measured point would change a little bit and the slippage might occur on the measuring head the permanent deformation produced after the collapse is shown in fig 17 the maximum deformation was produced between section l1 4 and section l1 2 due to the aforementioned analysis of stress the local web buckling took place first and there was no unloading on the attached plating before ultimate limit state as a result the out of plane deformation on the web induced the adjacent plate to deform rotating the intersecting line of the stiffener and plate during the unloading process 4 2 3 t1b2l15 the measured stress and out of plane displacement on the web are shown in fig 18 and fig 19 the ultimate strength of the specimen was 607 9 kn the length of specimen t1b2l15 was 50 larger than t1b2l1 and the transverse sections of two specimens were same it was shown that some strain gauges such as s1 in the plate of section l1 4 and s1 and s3 in the plate of section l1 2 maintained in a low level which was less than 100 mpa and no obvious changes were shown in the loading process it might be due to that there were some local dent in the measured area or the strain gauges were not pasted to the surface of plate closely in addition the measured results in those locations could not reflect the actual strain changes as a result the data was not analyzed and the similar data in the other specimens was ignored the local web buckling still took place first with s4 unloading in section l1 2 as the applied load increased to about 200 kn as the bifurcation between s4 and s5 which was on right and left surfaces of the web respectively reached maximum amplitude such as in section l1 2 the measured point s6 in adjacent flange started unloading moreover the specimen achieved the maximum load carrying capacity within about 8 kn load increment it indicated that the buckling in flange was induced by the out of plane deformation of the web in addition the attached plating was mainly collapsed due to yielding the permanent deformation after the collapse is illustrated in fig 20 a the maximum deformation was produced between section l1 4 and the loaded edge near the hydraulic press as shown in fig 20 b 4 2 4 t1b3l1 the breadth of attached plating of specimen t1b3l1 was 50 larger than that of the three aforementioned specimens and the transverse sectional size of t bar was same the ultimate load carrying capacity of the specimen was 725 9 kn which was 21 3 larger than that of specimen t1b2l1 however the average ultimate stress namely 287 2 mpa was 3 3 less than that of specimen t1b2l1 as shown in table 3 it was due to that the increase of the breadth of attached plating would reduce the critical buckling stress or average ultimate compressive stress the measured stress and out of plane displacement on the web are shown in fig 21 and fig 22 a similar phenomenon that the local web buckling took place first was found in three sections with the increasing of applied load and the further development of web buckling the unloading in flange occurred and a rapid change was shown as the applied load reached to 700 kn which was closed to the ultimate strength with 725 9 kn at the same time the occurrence of unloading in partial structures of attached plating such as s3 in section l1 4 and l3 4 and the remained structures were failure due to yielding it was different with the aforementioned specimens t1b2 which collapsed mainly due to yielding the reason was that the critical buckling stress of plating would decrease with the increasing of the breadth of plating in general the specimen was still collapsed due to the local web buckling in addition the specimen reached ultimate limit state soon after the buckling in attached plating took place the permanent deformation after the collapse is illustrated in fig 23 it was shown that the maximum collapse deformation occurred between section l1 4 and the loaded edge 4 2 5 t1b3l12 the measured stress and out of plane displacement on the web are shown in fig 24 and fig 25 the ultimate load carrying capacity of the specimen was 694 0 kn however not only the rigidity but also the ultimate strength of t1b3l12 was lower than t1b3l1 and t1b3l15 as shown in fig 11 in the measured three sections the bifurcation between s4 and s5 appeared from loading especially in section l1 2 the phenomenon that the local web buckling took place earlier would significantly reduce the compressive rigidity of specimen moreover the out of plane deformation consequently on the web would result in the further deformation on the adjacent flange and plate as the applied load increased to 550 kn the local deformation of the flange in section l1 4 occurred due to the occurrence of the unloading in s6 as the load increased to 650 kn which was close to the ultimate strength 655 9 kn the unloading took place in partial attached plating and the others entered into the plastic state in three sections the permanent deformation after the collapse is illustrated in fig 26 in the left view the location of the maximum out of plane deformation in the plate was between section l1 4 and the loaded edge in the right view the maximum one was in section l1 4 moreover both two out of plane deformation in left and right were on the hog it was different from other specimens in which the local half wave in the left and right attached plating would rotate in reverse about the intersecting line of the stiffener and plate as the adjacent web was in large out of plane deformation one of the probable causes was that there were multi half waves on the web and not only the amplitudes but also the distributions were irregular as shown in fig 10 it would result in the local distortion deformation on the web the other cause might be that the additional bending moment was produced due to that the height of loading center was not in the neutral axis of the cross section of the specimen as the effects of 4 mm gap between m16 bolts and 20 mm diameter of through holes couldn t be minimum in the assembling process due to the large initial geometrical deformations especially under the extreme condition that the height of the loading center in two loaded edge was not the same the local stepwise deformation would be induced as the local out of plane deformation was large in the adjacent web 4 2 6 t1b3l15 the measured stress and out of plane displacement on the web are shown in fig 27 and fig 28 the ultimate load carrying capacity of the specimen was 694 0 kn in section l1 4 and l3 4 the bifurcation between s4 and s5 almost from loading it implied that local buckling on the web took place first as the applied load reached to 650 kn which was closed to the ultimate strength 694 0 kn the s6 or s7 on one side of the flange started to unload in addition the compressive stress on most parts of attached plating continued growth until entering into the plastic stage and the others such as s1 in in section l1 2 unloaded rapidly at the same time the out of plane displacement in section l1 4 and l1 2 increased quickly with a small load increment of 44 0 kn the specimen achieved the maximum load carrying capacity the permanent deformation after the collapse is shown in fig 29 the location of local collapse was between l1 4 and l1 2 with significantly out of plane deformation on the web and adjacent plate 4 3 discussion of results based on the aforementioned analysis on the change of stress and out of plane displacement the buckling modes of specimens could be summarized as follows above all the local web buckling took place first and the increasing out of plane deflection on the web would cause further deforming on adjacent flange and plate with the increasing of applied load the local buckling on the web with multi half waves would not result in that the specimens enter into ultimate limit state quickly as the flange and attached plating were stronger for the present specimens secondly the attached plating collapsed due to yield failure for specimens t1b2 with the breadth of attached plating increasing by 50 for specimens t1b3 buckling of plate was observed first as the load carrying capacity was close to the maximum in addition most of structures in attached plating still collapse due to yield failure although the wider plate would result in lower critical buckling strength moreover the maximum load carrying capacity of specimen t1b2 was lower than that of the corresponding specimen t1b3 with the same length however the maximum compressive stress was decreasing with the increasing of breadth of attached plating it meant that the load carrying capacity of per unit area of specimen t1b3 was lower than t1b2 the results was corresponding with the phenomenon that the attached plating of specimens t1b2 collapsed due to yield failure and plates of specimens t1b3 were failure due to both yield and buckling thirdly the increasing of length of specimens with same transverse sections would not result in obvious decrease of ultimate strength it was different with other the previous researches xu and guedes soares 2013b gordo and soares 2014 the probable reason was that the specimens were failure due to local buckling of plates and the aspect ratio of plates which would influence the critical buckling strength was large even for the specimen t1b2l1 in addition no global buckling or deflection took place due to the fact that no unloading was observed in the measured points s2 or s2 which was near the intersecting line of web and attached plating finally the permanent deformation or collapse location was not always in the middle of the longitudinal length the reason was that the specimen collapsed due to local web buckling and multi half wave deflections with different amplitudes on the web were shown in the measured initial geometrical deformation the location of maximum local web buckling and the collapse produced consequently might not be in the middle of the length and the specimen was failure due to local large deformation it was different from the beam column collapse or the tripping of stiffener which mostly occurred in the middle of the length which was shown in the previous researches xu and guedes soares 2013b choi et al 2009 the web local buckling mode is also one of the collapse modes of stiffened panels paik and thayamballi 2003 2007 it is complicated that two or more buckling modes might take place on stiffened panels such as the coupling of web local buckling and overall buckling besides the local buckling might occur on the attached plating first as the stiffeners are strong in this study the web local buckling mode on stiffened columns is one of the probable web buckling modes on stiffened panels the web local buckling takes place first then the attached plating and flange are designed strongly to avoid the local buckling on them taking place earlier it indicated that no obvious coupling of local buckling on plates namely attached plating web and flange takes place moreover the increasing out of plane deflection on the web after the occurrence of web buckling would result in the further deforming on adjacent flange and plate with the increasing of applied load in general the feature of web local buckling observed in the present study may occur on the stiffened panels as the buckling strength of the web is designed weaker than that of the flange and attached plating for stiffened panels 5 ultimate strength comparison between numerical calculation and test results non linear fe analysis with abaqus software is used to calculate the ultimate strength of specimens the true stress strain of material and average measured thickness of t3 and t5 as shown in fig 8 and table 2 are adopted in numerical analysis the s4r shell element with four nodes and six degrees of freedom per node are applied in specimens the measured initial geometrical deformations are used in the fe analysis and the process is illustrated as follows a deformed surface of the plate is obtained by measuring initial geometrical deflections then the surface with initial deflections is imported into fe software and the mesh is generated on the deformed surface to create shell elements through this process the measured initial geometrical deformations are employed in the fe analysis the coordinate system is given in fig 30 and ux uy and uz are the displacements along the x axis y axis and z axis directions respectively rx ry and rz are the angles rotating about x axis y axis and z axis respectively the nodes on two loading edges are respectively tied to two corresponding reference points which are at the center of the cross section of the stiffened column the uz of reference point 1 is equal to zero and the reference point 2 locates at another loading edge namely uz equaling to the length of specimens the boundary conditions are illustrated in table 4 the ultimate strength of specimens calculated by numerical analysis is shown in table 5 the results calculated by fe analysis with true stress strain curves the average measured thickness and measured initial geometrical deformation could reach a good agreement with experimental results the errors for specimens except t1b3l12 are between 2 1 and 3 9 for t1b3l12 the ultimate strength is 7 6 percent less than that in fe analysis the error is larger than others are the reason is as previously stated the effects of the 4 mm gap were not minimum and the height of the loading center was moved from the neutral axis of the cross section of specimen the welding induced stresses are not taken into account in the fe analysis in this test the specimens were manufactured and welded precisely moreover aging treatment and pre loading before tests were carried out to reduce the residual stress shen et al 2019 tested stiffened columns with web opening under compressive bending loadings and numerical analysis was conducted to study the effects of welding induced stresses the conclusion is that the residual stress with the average level smith et al 1992 would reduce the ultimate strength by no more than 2 it indicates that the welding induced stresses have a minor impact on the load carrying capacity therefore the welding induced stresses are not considered in the fe analysis although residual stresses might not be released fully as the load shortening curves of the pre loadings were not saved in this test the ultimate strength of specimens would be reduced due to eccentricity which is produced by the global initial imperfection in general the typical global initial imperfection paik et al 2008 is expressed as follows 5 w o c c 0 sin π x b sin π z a where b is the width of attached plating and c 0 is equal to 0 001a the measured initial imperfection of the specimen is decomposed into local deflection and global deflection the shape of global initial imperfection in eq 2 is used while the measured maximum amplitude of global initial deflection c 0 is 1 7 mm for specimen t1b2l12 which is taken as an example to analyze the effects of global initial imperfection to ultimate strength two and three times of measured c 0 namely 3 4 mm and 5 1 mm are also used to analyze the effects of different levels of global initial imperfection moreover 1 2 mm for specimen t1b2l12 is also taken into account as the maximum amplitude of global initial imperfection it is calculated by 0 001a paik et al 2008 which is widely used in the numerical calculations of ultimate strength the ultimate strength of specimen t1b2l12 with different levels of global initial imperfection is calculated and the results are shown in table 6 it indicates that the global initial imperfection has little effects on the ultimate strength of specimen even if the maximum amplitude of global initial deflection is taken as 5 1 mm which is three times of the measured result the reason is that the specimens in this study collapse with local web buckling mode and no global buckling takes place as a result although the global initial imperfection would result in eccentricity during the load exposure and reduce the ultimate strength there are little effects to the ultimate strength of specimens in this study 6 effects of different material constitutive model tensile tests of high tensile steel used in the specimens with different thickness were conducted to get the true stress strain curve both the true stress strain curve and elastic perfectly plastic curve are used in fe analysis to study the effects of different material constitutive models as the elastic perfectly plastic curve is widely used in numerical calculations two kinds of material constitutive model are shown in fig 31 the ultimate strength of specimens is calculated with true and elastic perfectly plastic stress strain curve respectively and the notation ft and fe perf p are used to represent the results as shown in table 7 fe perf p is approximately 10 percent higher than fture for six specimens it means that numerical calculation with the elastic perfectly plastic stress strain curve would overestimate the ultimate strength of specimens the reason is that the proportional limit stress is significantly lower than 0 2 proof stress of the high tensile steel used in specimens and the non linear property between proportional limit stress and 0 2 proof stress would reduce the ultimate strength of specimen obviously in addition the strain hardening used in the calculation of fe perf p doesn t result in a higher ultimate strength and it may play a role at the post ultimate limit state a special material constitutive model with two parts is studied to testify the aforementioned explanation and exclude the effects of strain hardening the first part is that the true stress strain curve is used from zero to 0 2 proof stress the second part is that the strain hardening rate is equal to zero from 0 2 proof stress to tensile stress the special stress strain curve is shown in fig 32 and the ultimate strength calculated with this special curve is represented by fte perf p it is illustrated that fte perf p is approximately 1 lower than fture in table 7 what this means that the strain hardening hardly contribute to the ultimate strength of specimens but it would affect the collapse behavior at post ultimate limit state the specimen t1b3l15 with the maximum breadth of attached plating and length is adopted as an example to study the distribution of stress when the specimen stays in the ultimate limit state as the proportional limit stress and 0 2 proof stress of web are 375 mpa and 538 mpa and that of the attached plating and flange are 275 mpa and 493 mpa von mises stress nephogram at ultimate limit state are shown respectively in fig 33 the elements with gray color which have a higher stress than 0 2 proof stress take no proportion in the flange a small proportion in attached plating and about 40 proportion on the web only in this part the strain hardening would take effects the elements with black color have a lower stress than proportional limit stress for these elements the material properties have no difference between elastic perfectly plastic curve and true material curve however the elements with full color which stay between proportional limit stress and 0 2 proof stress account for a large percentage of structure as a result the non linear property of material between proportional limit stress and 0 2 proof stress would affect the ultimate strength significantly and fe perf p is 9 8 percent higher than fture for t1b3l15 the elastic perfectly plastic material constitutive model will not always overestimate the ultimate strength for some steel structures the elastic perfectly plastic curve will underestimate the ultimate strength and get a conservative result when the material proportional limit stress is close to 0 2 proof stress or yield stress and the strain hardening take effects before structure reaching into the ultimate limit state the strain hardening will play an important role as the occurrence of buckling is later and a large part of the structure stays at the plastic stage before collapse the specimen t1b3l15 with various thickness is used to study the law of change for the difference between the elastic perfectly plastic curve and the true curve the true stress strain curve of t5 which has a significant non linear property between proportional limit stress and 0 2 proof stress than that of t3 is used in the structure and the thickness of the whole three plates is the same the ultimate strength of structures with different thicknesses and two kinds of material constitutive models are shown in table 8 with the increase of thickness the occurrence of buckling is pushed backward and the effects of strain hardening of the true curve will enhance the ultimate strength of structure with respect to the elastic perfectly plastic curve it is illustrated in table 8 that the elastic perfectly plastic constitutive model is applicable when the thickness is higher than 30 mm and it would get a safe result in numerical calculation of ultimate strength 7 conclusions in this paper the ultimate strength and web local buckling collapse of stiffened columns have been studied with experiments and numerical calculations the results calculated by fe analysis with true stress strain curves the average measured thickness and measured initial geometrical deformation could reach a good agreement with experimental results the analysis of web local buckling and the effects of material constitutive models are concluded as follows 1 the local web buckling took place first and the increasing out of plane deflection on the web caused further deforming on adjacent flange and plate with the increasing of applied load it indicates that not only the web local buckling itself will decrease the ultimate strength but also the enlarged deflections of structures produced by adjacent web local buckling will accelerate the reduction of the ultimate strength of specimens 2 the failure location of specimens under web local buckling collapse is not always in the middle of the longitudinal length due to the irregular multi half wave initial geometrical deflections with varying amplitudes in the web this phenomenon is different from the beam column collapse or the tripping of stiffener 3 the elastic perfectly plastic material constitutive model will not always overestimate the ultimate strength as non linear property between proportional limit stress and 0 2 proof stress of material would reduce the ultimate strength of the specimen it implied that the application of steel with varying tangential modulus and high 0 2 proof stress should be paid more

21446,the ultimate strength of six stiffened columns under axial compressive loading are studied by experimental and numerical methods the web local buckling mode observed in specimens is analyzed based on the measured strain and displacement during the test the effects of measured stress strain curve and elastic perfectly plastic curve of material to the ultimate strength of specimens are investigated by numerical calculations the simply supported boundaries at the loaded edges and free boundaries at unloaded edges were produced based on the horizontal test fixture the initial geometrical imperfections were measured and tensile tests with different thicknesses were conducted to get the true stress strain curve the strain gauges and displacement meters were installed to analyze the failure modes and it indicated that the local web buckling occurred first and dominated the collapse the ultimate strength calculated by numerical analysis reaches a good agreement with experimental results the ultimate strength calculated with the elastic perfectly plastic curve is approximately 10 larger than that with the true stress strain curve it indicates that the elastic perfectly plastic material constitutive model will not always overestimate the ultimate strength as the non linear property between the proportional limit stress and 0 2 proof stress of material would reduce the ultimate strength keywords stiffened column compressive test ultimate strength material constitutive model local web buckling 1 introduction the stiffened columns are the fundamental components of ships and offshore structures and several continuous stiffened columns come together to be the stiffened panels which are the significant structures in hull girders the ultimate limit state design is adopted to assess the safety margin of ships widely the vertical ultimate bending strength of the hull girder is one of the most important strength design criteria and it is studied by numerical calculations and ultimate bending strength tests wang et al 2019 xu et al 2019 fully the in plane compressive loading especially in deck and bottom could be caused by vertical bending moment as a result the ultimate strength of the stiffened column subjected to axial in plane compression plays an important part in ship structural design and several researchers have studied it in the past non linear finite element method fem was widely used to evaluate the ultimate strength of structures tanaka et al 2014 paik et al 2008 and the influence factors such as boundary conditions xu et al 2013 collapse modes initial imperfections khedmati et al 2014 were taken into account zhang and khan 2009 proposed a semi analytical formula to evaluate the ultimate strength of stiffened panels and the results were verified with several stiffened panels calculated by abaqus non linear fe software based on a large number of numerical simulations kim et al 2017 and xu et al 2018 proposed the empirical formulations for simplified calculation of ultimate strength respectively however due to the complexity of variables in real stiffened columns the modeling parameters used in numerical analysis and theoretical calculations are usually simplified for example the initial geometrical deformation was reduced to defined shapes and amplitudes without randomness kim et al 2018 the true stress strain curves of the material were almost simplified to elastic perfectly plastic model tanaka et al 2014 or bi linear elastic plastic model ghavami and khedmati 2006 which only contains three parameters young s modulus yield stress and strain hardening rate as a result although the experimental method is more expensive and exhausting it is a good way to study the ultimate strength of stiffened columns and get useful conclusions several uniaxial compressive tests have been done on stiffened panels in the past sheikh et al 2003 carried out compression and bending tests on stiffened steel plates with t shape stiffeners and the test results have shown that a sharp drop of load carrying capacity took place after ultimate strength in stiffener tripping failure and a slow decline occurred in plate buckling collapse ten stiffened panels which have three flat bar stiffeners with the extent of three longitudinal span and one transverse bay were tested by tanaka and endo 1988 under compressive loading and brackets were used on side span to guarantee the collapse location at middle span ghavami 1994 tested 17 stiffened panels with one or two stiffeners and three types of longitudinal stiffeners including flat bar angel bar and tee bar one two and three spans in the longitudinal extent of specimens were considered and four simply supported boundaries were produced ghavami and khedmati 2006 took initial geometrical imperfections and bi linear behavior for the material with the strain hardening rate of e 65 into account and considered that the fe numerical calculations could get a good result with the test results three bay stiffened panels under axial compression until collapse were tested and some of them collapsed at the side bay gordo and soares 2011 xu and guedes soares 2013a tested five narrow stiffened panels which has two flat bar stiffeners and the longitudinal extent of 1 2 1 1 2 span was adopted to avoid side span collapse five wide stiffened panels with four stiffeners under uniaxial compression were also tested and the collapse took place in the middle bay for all specimens xu and guedes soares 2013b ten stiffened plates with flat bar or t bar stiffener were tested to verify the minimum stiffness requirements and one longitudinal span was adopted with simply supported boundary conditions at loaded edges choi et al 2009 typical stiffened plates with openings were tested and both the ultimate strength and collapse modes in the test were similar to the results from the numerical calculation by fe analysis cui and wang 2020 the buckling collapse modes of specimens in the previous tests mainly focused on the beam column collapse or tripping of stiffener the web buckling of stiffened columns was observed obviously as the primary and dominant buckling mode in this test besides the true stress strain curves of high tensile steel for making specimens showed the non linear property between the proportional limit stress and 0 2 proof stress the effects of the non linear part to the ultimate strength of specimens could be studied in this test as the proportional limit stress was often close to the yield stress in the stress strain curves of steel in the previous tests in this paper six stiffened columns were tested under axial compression to study the ultimate strength and buckling collapse modes the simply supported boundaries at the loaded edges and free boundaries at unloaded edges were produced based on the horizontal test fixture the initial geometrical imperfections on flange web and attached plating were measured and tensile tests of high tensile steel used in the specimens with different thicknesses were conducted to get the true stress strain curve the strain gauges and displacement meters were installed to study the failure modes the ultimate strength calculated by fe analysis with taking the true stress strain curves average measured thickness and measured initial geometrical deformations into account is compared with the results in the test both the true stress strain curve and elastic perfectly plastic curve are used in finite element analysis to study the influence of the material constitutive model as the elastic perfectly plastic curve is widely used in numerical calculations 2 experimental setup in this test the simply supported boundary conditions were adopted at loaded edges and free boundaries were used along the long edges of the attached plating the boundary conditions were always difficult to designed and simulated as same as the real ones of continuous stiffened panels in ship structures the conditions at frames for continuous stiffened panels were between simply supports and clamped supports and the symmetric or anti symmetric conditions were employed along the centerline of the local attached plating choi et al 2009 although the boundary conditions of specimens were different from that in the continuous stiffened panel and the simply supports at loaded edges and the free supports at unloaded edges would give a lower result than true the boundary conditions of specimens used in fe analysis were the same with that in test and could reflect the real ultimate strength of the specimen in addition both the effects of the material constitutive models and the web local buckling collapse modes were shown in the test with current conditions 2 1 horizontal test setup the uniaxial compressive tests for stiffened columns were performed with a 200 ton hydraulic press and a horizontal testing fixture was designed and manufactured as shown in fig 1 the test fixture consists of an outer frame a steel plate with equally distributed screw hole two supporting piers with steel cover plate a load transfer beam two axes of rotation with steel plate four point contact supports and two lengthened cushion block for different length of specimens the steel plates with a thickness of 30 mm were widely used in the structures of fixtures to guarantee that the fixture has sufficient rigidity and the smallest deformation during the test process the top and side views of the schematic illustration of the whole test fixture are shown in fig 2 the loading center was set in the neutral axis of the cross section of the specimen to avoid additional bending moment and unintended transverse forces as shown in fig 2 b the steel plate on the axis of rotation and endplate of specimens was tied by four bolts to keep contact fully the diameter of through holes on the aforementioned structures was 20 mm and m16 bolts were used to make sure that the assembly could be done successfully the height of specimens was adjusted carefully to fit the designed loading center during the installation as the gaps existed between eight pairs of bolts and corresponding through holes would result in additional bending moment and reduce the ultimate compressive strength of specimens by doing this the negative effects of gaps were minimized in the test the axis of rotation with steel plates and the point contact supports are given in fig 3 the steel circular shafts with a diameter of 30 mm were separately welded on the two aforementioned structures as a result the point contact was produced by two crossed steel circular shafts to reduce frictional force applied by the horizontal loading the load control was used on the hydraulic press and the loading speed with 25 kn per min was adopted to keep that the loading procedure was a quasi static process the data of load and displacement were recorded in the whole loading and unloading process and the sampling frequency of 10 hz was adequate as the loading sampling interval was 0 042 kn 2 2 specimens of stiffened column the specimens of stiffened columns which are the basic unit of stiffened plates is combined by a tee bar stiffener and its attached plating based on stiffened columns the effects of different material constitutive models could be studied while relative conclusions would be promoted to the calculations of stiffened plates besides the buckling modes in the basic unit of stiffened plates which is web buckling in this test would be analyzed as the fundamental study about the buckling β b t p σ y e modes the height and thickness of the web were 200 mm and 3 mm and expressed with hw and tw respectively the breadth and thickness of flange were 80 mm and 5 mm and expressed with bf and tf respectively two important parameters namely plate slenderness ratio β and stiffener slenderness ratio λ include not only the geometrical sizes of stiffened panels but also material properties and the close relationship between the two parameters and ultimate strength have been proved in many previous studies zhang 2016 xu et al 2018 the two parameters are defined as follows 1 plate slenderness ratio β b t p σ e 2 stiffener slenderness ratio λ a r σ y e 3 radius of gyration r i a where i and a are moment of inertia and area of the stiffener cross section with attached plating based on the structures at the mid ship region of 12 double hull oil tankers and 10 bulk carriers zhang 2016 concluded that β was between 1 0 and 2 5 and λ was between 0 25 and 0 95 according to the existing british warships smith 1975 summarized that β was between 1 0 and 4 5 and λ was between 0 15 and 0 90 besides the number of stiffeners had small effects on the ultimate strength of stiffened plates on the condition that λ was less than or equal to 0 6 ozdemir et al 2018 in this study the plate slenderness ratio of specimens was designed with 1 9 and 2 8 and the stiffener slenderness ratio was from 0 19 to 0 29 both of plate slenderness ratio and stiffener slenderness ratio were in the aforementioned ranges two end attached plating with the thickness of 10 mm were welded to the loading edges of specimens respectively and were used to tie to the steel plate on the axis of rotation for carrying out the free rotation of simply supports boundary conditions it could also keep the loading edges as a plane to reduce the asymmetric loading as the gap between the stiffener and supported steel block would unexpected lower ultimate strength xu and guedes soares 2013a six specimens in this experiment were named by a combination of numbers and letters to distinguish from each other t1b2l1 the name of specimens is shown as an example to explain the meanings of numbers and letters t and subsequent 1 mean one t bar two kinds of breadth of the attached plating were adopted as 200 mm and 300 mm and the notation b2 and b3 were used respectively three longitudinal length of specimens without the thickness of end attached plating were designed as 1000 mm 1200 mm and 1500 mm and the abbreviations l1 l12 and l15 were employed the cross section of specimens is shown in fig 4 and typical specimens t1b3l15 is given in fig 5 the geometrical sizes of specimens and their code name are illustrated in table 1 the notation a bp and tp are the longitudinal length of specimens without the thickness of the end attached plating breadth and thickness of the attached plating respectively 2 3 strain gauges and displacement meters twenty four strain gauges were used in a specimen six of them were set on the upper surface of the flange nine and three of them were installed on the upper and lower surfaces of the attached plating respectively the other six strain gauges were used on the symmetric locations on both the two side surfaces of the web in the longitudinal direction three sections in a quarter a half and three quarters of the length were selected to install strain gauges and they were represented with the notation l1 4 l1 2 and l3 4 respectively and the section l1 4 was closed to the hydraulic press the distribution of gauges is illustrated in fig 6 and the marked circle is used to represent the strain gauge the notation s plus number and ul are used to represent the measured location of strain and out of plane displacement respectively 3 material tensile test and measurement of initial geometrical imperfection 3 1 material tensile test the attached plating and flange in the stiffened column were made of the nominal 5 mm thick high tensile steel plate t5 and the web was made of nominal 3 mm thick high tensile steel plate t3 the measured average thickness of t3 and t5 were 3 0 mm and 5 3 mm and that were used in numerical calculations in fe analysis the material used for tensile specimens and corresponding components in the stiffened column were in the same plate to get the accurate material stress strain curve the tensile specimens were designed according to gb t 228 1 2010 the tensile test with a steady loading velocity is 3 mm per min was carried out to get the mechanical properties of the material the material tensile testing machine with extensometer and specimens at fracture are shown in fig 7 the engineering stress strain curves of t3 and t5 high tensile steel are shown in fig 8 the true stress strain curves of material which were used in non linear fe analysis were obtain based on eq 4 and given in fig 8 4 ε t r u e ln 1 ε e n g σ t r u e σ e n g 1 ε e n g the young s modulus e and poisson s ratio are equal to 200 gpa and 0 3 respectively the proportional limit stress σ p 0 2 proof stress σ p 0 2 and the ultimate tensile stress σ m of t3 and t5 are illustrated in table 2 3 2 measurement of initial geometrical imperfection initial imperfections produced in the process of fabrications and manufactures such as initial deflections are unavoidable as the initial geometrical deflections would decrease the compressive rigidity and ultimate strength of the stiffened columns the measurements were carried out carefully after the pre loading which was used to release the residual stress based on the latest dynamic gauge points tracking image technology the initial geometrical deflections in the attached plating web and flange were measured by hand held laser scanning system as shown in fig 9 several anchor points were fixed on the objective plates and then the coordinates of the surface of the plate can be obtained by the hand held laser scanning system with a scanning density of 10 mm 10 mm the measured initial deflections of specimen t1b2l12 and t1b3l12 are illustrated as examples in fig 10 moreover the measured initial imperfections are the actual deflections including local and global parts take the flange of t1b2l12 as an example there are both local deflections and global single half wave deflection along the longitudinal direction which is shown obviously in the intersecting line of flange and web in fig 10 c 4 experimental results 4 1 ultimate strength six specimens were tested under axial compression by a 200 ton hydraulic press and a horizontal test fixture the loading speed with 25 kn per min was adopted and the data of loading and displacement was recorded in the loading process pre loading was carried out to reduce the gaps in the whole test fixture the amplitude of pre loading was 100 kn and the maximum stress in specimens was about 50 mpa to guarantee that the material was still in elastic stage in this pre loading cycle the force and strain were recorded during loading after that formal loading was started until the ultimate strength of specimens was reached then the forced end shortening continued to be applied by the hydraulic press until the reaction force reducing to approximately 80 of ultimate strength finally the displacement was reduced and permanent deformations after the collapse were produced on specimens the load displacement curves of specimens are shown in fig 11 and the ultimate strength is given in table 3 in the initial loading stage namely end shortening increasing from zero to approximately 2 mm the amount of increase in applied force was small the reason was that some gaps existed between specimens and each part in the horizontal test setup and the hydraulic press when contacts were fully made with the increasing of force the load displacement relationship of specimens reached into the linear growth process this phenomenon has also been seen in other experiments xu and guedes soares 2013a the rigidity and ultimate strength of t1b3l12 were lower than that of the others as shown in fig 11 the probable cause was that the height of the loading center was not in the neutral axis of the cross section of the specimen as the initial geometrical deformations of t1b3l12 were large and the effects of 4 mm gap between m16 bolts and 20 mm diameter of through holes couldn t be minimum in the assembling process 4 2 buckling collapse modes the twenty four strain gauges and three displacement meters as shown in fig 6 were installed in specimens to analyze the buckling collapse modes the measured point s1 s2 s3 s1 s2 and s3 were on the attached plating and s1 and s1 were on the upper and lower surfaces of the same location the point s4 and s5 were on the left and right surfaces of the web in the same location to study the local buckling the s6 and s7 were on the upper surface of the flange and close to the two free boundaries respectively in addition the measured strain data conversed with corresponding stress based on the engineering stress strain curves of high tensile steel in fig 8 the changing of stress and out of plane displacement were analyzed to study the buckling sequence of local structures and buckling collapse modes 4 2 1 t1b2l1 the ultimate strength of specimen t1b2l1 was 598 5 kn and then unload to 400 kn the measured data is shown in fig 12 and fig 13 the relationship between the compressive stress and load was almost linear in the initial phase moreover the compressive stresses in a symmetrical position such as s6 and s7 in section l1 4 were not same but linear to the applied load the reason was that the symmetry of specimens was not very good as the machining precision and initial imperfections could not be controlled precisely with the applied load increasing to about 200 kn the phenomena that one of the measured stress s4 or s5 was unloading and the other one entered into accelerated growth stage were illustrated in the three sections of the specimen at the same time no unloading took place on the attached plating and flange from this we can see that local web buckling occurred first and it developed fast with the increasing of applied load with the applied load increasing to about 400 kn the stress of s6 and s7 in flange started to make a difference it indicated that the out of plane deformation of flange occurred the buckling in flange was mainly affected by the adjacent deformation on the web due to the high local buckling strength of flange moreover the unloading of stress in attached plating occur first in position s3 of section l1 4 it implied that the location of collapse might be near this section as the load increased to 500 kn the difference between s4 and s5 in web reached a high level essentially in section l1 4 the out of plane displacements on the center of the web of in this section increased rapidly as given in fig 13 b moreover the stress in attached plating came into an accelerated growth stage when the specimen achieved maximum loading capacity namely 598 5 kn the largest bifurcation took place in web and the obvious web buckling collapse resulted in the loss of structural loading capacity the stress of most parts in attached plating exceeded 0 2 proof stress of material and the structures collapsed with yielding it indicated that both buckling and yield leaded to the collapse of specimen moreover there was no unloading in point s2 and s2 of three sections which was in the junction line of web and attached plating it implied that no global flexible deformation took place the permanent deformation produced after unloading is illustrated in fig 14 it was obvious that the maximum out of plane deformation occurred on the web between the loading edge and section l1 4 and there was a small deformation on the adjacent flange and attached plating the collapse location was consistent with the analysis of aforementioned the changing law of stresses and displacement in web 4 2 2 t1b2l12 the measured stress and out of plane displacement on the web were shown in fig 15 and fig 16 and the ultimate strength of the specimen was 619 4 kn the length of specimen t1b2l12 was 20 larger than t1b2l1 and the transverse sections of two specimens were same the local web buckling still occurred first based on that the bifurcation of stresses on the web of three sections came into being first as the applied load was about 200 kn the bifurcation of two measured stresses in the flange of section l1 4 namely s6 and s7 took place as the applied load was equal to about 500 kn however this phenomenon was not shown in the two other sections it implied that the out of plane deformation of flange only took place in section l1 4 as the applied load exceeding 500 kn the growth of compressive stresses in attached plating accelerated and the structures entered into the plastic stage in the ultimate limit state at the same time the obvious increasing of out of plane displacements on the web is shown in fig 16 b in addition the measured displacement especially in l3 4 became very large during unloading it was due to that the longitudinal end shortening of specimen increased and the longitudinal location of displacement meters remained the same as given in fig 17 the measured point would change a little bit and the slippage might occur on the measuring head the permanent deformation produced after the collapse is shown in fig 17 the maximum deformation was produced between section l1 4 and section l1 2 due to the aforementioned analysis of stress the local web buckling took place first and there was no unloading on the attached plating before ultimate limit state as a result the out of plane deformation on the web induced the adjacent plate to deform rotating the intersecting line of the stiffener and plate during the unloading process 4 2 3 t1b2l15 the measured stress and out of plane displacement on the web are shown in fig 18 and fig 19 the ultimate strength of the specimen was 607 9 kn the length of specimen t1b2l15 was 50 larger than t1b2l1 and the transverse sections of two specimens were same it was shown that some strain gauges such as s1 in the plate of section l1 4 and s1 and s3 in the plate of section l1 2 maintained in a low level which was less than 100 mpa and no obvious changes were shown in the loading process it might be due to that there were some local dent in the measured area or the strain gauges were not pasted to the surface of plate closely in addition the measured results in those locations could not reflect the actual strain changes as a result the data was not analyzed and the similar data in the other specimens was ignored the local web buckling still took place first with s4 unloading in section l1 2 as the applied load increased to about 200 kn as the bifurcation between s4 and s5 which was on right and left surfaces of the web respectively reached maximum amplitude such as in section l1 2 the measured point s6 in adjacent flange started unloading moreover the specimen achieved the maximum load carrying capacity within about 8 kn load increment it indicated that the buckling in flange was induced by the out of plane deformation of the web in addition the attached plating was mainly collapsed due to yielding the permanent deformation after the collapse is illustrated in fig 20 a the maximum deformation was produced between section l1 4 and the loaded edge near the hydraulic press as shown in fig 20 b 4 2 4 t1b3l1 the breadth of attached plating of specimen t1b3l1 was 50 larger than that of the three aforementioned specimens and the transverse sectional size of t bar was same the ultimate load carrying capacity of the specimen was 725 9 kn which was 21 3 larger than that of specimen t1b2l1 however the average ultimate stress namely 287 2 mpa was 3 3 less than that of specimen t1b2l1 as shown in table 3 it was due to that the increase of the breadth of attached plating would reduce the critical buckling stress or average ultimate compressive stress the measured stress and out of plane displacement on the web are shown in fig 21 and fig 22 a similar phenomenon that the local web buckling took place first was found in three sections with the increasing of applied load and the further development of web buckling the unloading in flange occurred and a rapid change was shown as the applied load reached to 700 kn which was closed to the ultimate strength with 725 9 kn at the same time the occurrence of unloading in partial structures of attached plating such as s3 in section l1 4 and l3 4 and the remained structures were failure due to yielding it was different with the aforementioned specimens t1b2 which collapsed mainly due to yielding the reason was that the critical buckling stress of plating would decrease with the increasing of the breadth of plating in general the specimen was still collapsed due to the local web buckling in addition the specimen reached ultimate limit state soon after the buckling in attached plating took place the permanent deformation after the collapse is illustrated in fig 23 it was shown that the maximum collapse deformation occurred between section l1 4 and the loaded edge 4 2 5 t1b3l12 the measured stress and out of plane displacement on the web are shown in fig 24 and fig 25 the ultimate load carrying capacity of the specimen was 694 0 kn however not only the rigidity but also the ultimate strength of t1b3l12 was lower than t1b3l1 and t1b3l15 as shown in fig 11 in the measured three sections the bifurcation between s4 and s5 appeared from loading especially in section l1 2 the phenomenon that the local web buckling took place earlier would significantly reduce the compressive rigidity of specimen moreover the out of plane deformation consequently on the web would result in the further deformation on the adjacent flange and plate as the applied load increased to 550 kn the local deformation of the flange in section l1 4 occurred due to the occurrence of the unloading in s6 as the load increased to 650 kn which was close to the ultimate strength 655 9 kn the unloading took place in partial attached plating and the others entered into the plastic state in three sections the permanent deformation after the collapse is illustrated in fig 26 in the left view the location of the maximum out of plane deformation in the plate was between section l1 4 and the loaded edge in the right view the maximum one was in section l1 4 moreover both two out of plane deformation in left and right were on the hog it was different from other specimens in which the local half wave in the left and right attached plating would rotate in reverse about the intersecting line of the stiffener and plate as the adjacent web was in large out of plane deformation one of the probable causes was that there were multi half waves on the web and not only the amplitudes but also the distributions were irregular as shown in fig 10 it would result in the local distortion deformation on the web the other cause might be that the additional bending moment was produced due to that the height of loading center was not in the neutral axis of the cross section of the specimen as the effects of 4 mm gap between m16 bolts and 20 mm diameter of through holes couldn t be minimum in the assembling process due to the large initial geometrical deformations especially under the extreme condition that the height of the loading center in two loaded edge was not the same the local stepwise deformation would be induced as the local out of plane deformation was large in the adjacent web 4 2 6 t1b3l15 the measured stress and out of plane displacement on the web are shown in fig 27 and fig 28 the ultimate load carrying capacity of the specimen was 694 0 kn in section l1 4 and l3 4 the bifurcation between s4 and s5 almost from loading it implied that local buckling on the web took place first as the applied load reached to 650 kn which was closed to the ultimate strength 694 0 kn the s6 or s7 on one side of the flange started to unload in addition the compressive stress on most parts of attached plating continued growth until entering into the plastic stage and the others such as s1 in in section l1 2 unloaded rapidly at the same time the out of plane displacement in section l1 4 and l1 2 increased quickly with a small load increment of 44 0 kn the specimen achieved the maximum load carrying capacity the permanent deformation after the collapse is shown in fig 29 the location of local collapse was between l1 4 and l1 2 with significantly out of plane deformation on the web and adjacent plate 4 3 discussion of results based on the aforementioned analysis on the change of stress and out of plane displacement the buckling modes of specimens could be summarized as follows above all the local web buckling took place first and the increasing out of plane deflection on the web would cause further deforming on adjacent flange and plate with the increasing of applied load the local buckling on the web with multi half waves would not result in that the specimens enter into ultimate limit state quickly as the flange and attached plating were stronger for the present specimens secondly the attached plating collapsed due to yield failure for specimens t1b2 with the breadth of attached plating increasing by 50 for specimens t1b3 buckling of plate was observed first as the load carrying capacity was close to the maximum in addition most of structures in attached plating still collapse due to yield failure although the wider plate would result in lower critical buckling strength moreover the maximum load carrying capacity of specimen t1b2 was lower than that of the corresponding specimen t1b3 with the same length however the maximum compressive stress was decreasing with the increasing of breadth of attached plating it meant that the load carrying capacity of per unit area of specimen t1b3 was lower than t1b2 the results was corresponding with the phenomenon that the attached plating of specimens t1b2 collapsed due to yield failure and plates of specimens t1b3 were failure due to both yield and buckling thirdly the increasing of length of specimens with same transverse sections would not result in obvious decrease of ultimate strength it was different with other the previous researches xu and guedes soares 2013b gordo and soares 2014 the probable reason was that the specimens were failure due to local buckling of plates and the aspect ratio of plates which would influence the critical buckling strength was large even for the specimen t1b2l1 in addition no global buckling or deflection took place due to the fact that no unloading was observed in the measured points s2 or s2 which was near the intersecting line of web and attached plating finally the permanent deformation or collapse location was not always in the middle of the longitudinal length the reason was that the specimen collapsed due to local web buckling and multi half wave deflections with different amplitudes on the web were shown in the measured initial geometrical deformation the location of maximum local web buckling and the collapse produced consequently might not be in the middle of the length and the specimen was failure due to local large deformation it was different from the beam column collapse or the tripping of stiffener which mostly occurred in the middle of the length which was shown in the previous researches xu and guedes soares 2013b choi et al 2009 the web local buckling mode is also one of the collapse modes of stiffened panels paik and thayamballi 2003 2007 it is complicated that two or more buckling modes might take place on stiffened panels such as the coupling of web local buckling and overall buckling besides the local buckling might occur on the attached plating first as the stiffeners are strong in this study the web local buckling mode on stiffened columns is one of the probable web buckling modes on stiffened panels the web local buckling takes place first then the attached plating and flange are designed strongly to avoid the local buckling on them taking place earlier it indicated that no obvious coupling of local buckling on plates namely attached plating web and flange takes place moreover the increasing out of plane deflection on the web after the occurrence of web buckling would result in the further deforming on adjacent flange and plate with the increasing of applied load in general the feature of web local buckling observed in the present study may occur on the stiffened panels as the buckling strength of the web is designed weaker than that of the flange and attached plating for stiffened panels 5 ultimate strength comparison between numerical calculation and test results non linear fe analysis with abaqus software is used to calculate the ultimate strength of specimens the true stress strain of material and average measured thickness of t3 and t5 as shown in fig 8 and table 2 are adopted in numerical analysis the s4r shell element with four nodes and six degrees of freedom per node are applied in specimens the measured initial geometrical deformations are used in the fe analysis and the process is illustrated as follows a deformed surface of the plate is obtained by measuring initial geometrical deflections then the surface with initial deflections is imported into fe software and the mesh is generated on the deformed surface to create shell elements through this process the measured initial geometrical deformations are employed in the fe analysis the coordinate system is given in fig 30 and ux uy and uz are the displacements along the x axis y axis and z axis directions respectively rx ry and rz are the angles rotating about x axis y axis and z axis respectively the nodes on two loading edges are respectively tied to two corresponding reference points which are at the center of the cross section of the stiffened column the uz of reference point 1 is equal to zero and the reference point 2 locates at another loading edge namely uz equaling to the length of specimens the boundary conditions are illustrated in table 4 the ultimate strength of specimens calculated by numerical analysis is shown in table 5 the results calculated by fe analysis with true stress strain curves the average measured thickness and measured initial geometrical deformation could reach a good agreement with experimental results the errors for specimens except t1b3l12 are between 2 1 and 3 9 for t1b3l12 the ultimate strength is 7 6 percent less than that in fe analysis the error is larger than others are the reason is as previously stated the effects of the 4 mm gap were not minimum and the height of the loading center was moved from the neutral axis of the cross section of specimen the welding induced stresses are not taken into account in the fe analysis in this test the specimens were manufactured and welded precisely moreover aging treatment and pre loading before tests were carried out to reduce the residual stress shen et al 2019 tested stiffened columns with web opening under compressive bending loadings and numerical analysis was conducted to study the effects of welding induced stresses the conclusion is that the residual stress with the average level smith et al 1992 would reduce the ultimate strength by no more than 2 it indicates that the welding induced stresses have a minor impact on the load carrying capacity therefore the welding induced stresses are not considered in the fe analysis although residual stresses might not be released fully as the load shortening curves of the pre loadings were not saved in this test the ultimate strength of specimens would be reduced due to eccentricity which is produced by the global initial imperfection in general the typical global initial imperfection paik et al 2008 is expressed as follows 5 w o c c 0 sin π x b sin π z a where b is the width of attached plating and c 0 is equal to 0 001a the measured initial imperfection of the specimen is decomposed into local deflection and global deflection the shape of global initial imperfection in eq 2 is used while the measured maximum amplitude of global initial deflection c 0 is 1 7 mm for specimen t1b2l12 which is taken as an example to analyze the effects of global initial imperfection to ultimate strength two and three times of measured c 0 namely 3 4 mm and 5 1 mm are also used to analyze the effects of different levels of global initial imperfection moreover 1 2 mm for specimen t1b2l12 is also taken into account as the maximum amplitude of global initial imperfection it is calculated by 0 001a paik et al 2008 which is widely used in the numerical calculations of ultimate strength the ultimate strength of specimen t1b2l12 with different levels of global initial imperfection is calculated and the results are shown in table 6 it indicates that the global initial imperfection has little effects on the ultimate strength of specimen even if the maximum amplitude of global initial deflection is taken as 5 1 mm which is three times of the measured result the reason is that the specimens in this study collapse with local web buckling mode and no global buckling takes place as a result although the global initial imperfection would result in eccentricity during the load exposure and reduce the ultimate strength there are little effects to the ultimate strength of specimens in this study 6 effects of different material constitutive model tensile tests of high tensile steel used in the specimens with different thickness were conducted to get the true stress strain curve both the true stress strain curve and elastic perfectly plastic curve are used in fe analysis to study the effects of different material constitutive models as the elastic perfectly plastic curve is widely used in numerical calculations two kinds of material constitutive model are shown in fig 31 the ultimate strength of specimens is calculated with true and elastic perfectly plastic stress strain curve respectively and the notation ft and fe perf p are used to represent the results as shown in table 7 fe perf p is approximately 10 percent higher than fture for six specimens it means that numerical calculation with the elastic perfectly plastic stress strain curve would overestimate the ultimate strength of specimens the reason is that the proportional limit stress is significantly lower than 0 2 proof stress of the high tensile steel used in specimens and the non linear property between proportional limit stress and 0 2 proof stress would reduce the ultimate strength of specimen obviously in addition the strain hardening used in the calculation of fe perf p doesn t result in a higher ultimate strength and it may play a role at the post ultimate limit state a special material constitutive model with two parts is studied to testify the aforementioned explanation and exclude the effects of strain hardening the first part is that the true stress strain curve is used from zero to 0 2 proof stress the second part is that the strain hardening rate is equal to zero from 0 2 proof stress to tensile stress the special stress strain curve is shown in fig 32 and the ultimate strength calculated with this special curve is represented by fte perf p it is illustrated that fte perf p is approximately 1 lower than fture in table 7 what this means that the strain hardening hardly contribute to the ultimate strength of specimens but it would affect the collapse behavior at post ultimate limit state the specimen t1b3l15 with the maximum breadth of attached plating and length is adopted as an example to study the distribution of stress when the specimen stays in the ultimate limit state as the proportional limit stress and 0 2 proof stress of web are 375 mpa and 538 mpa and that of the attached plating and flange are 275 mpa and 493 mpa von mises stress nephogram at ultimate limit state are shown respectively in fig 33 the elements with gray color which have a higher stress than 0 2 proof stress take no proportion in the flange a small proportion in attached plating and about 40 proportion on the web only in this part the strain hardening would take effects the elements with black color have a lower stress than proportional limit stress for these elements the material properties have no difference between elastic perfectly plastic curve and true material curve however the elements with full color which stay between proportional limit stress and 0 2 proof stress account for a large percentage of structure as a result the non linear property of material between proportional limit stress and 0 2 proof stress would affect the ultimate strength significantly and fe perf p is 9 8 percent higher than fture for t1b3l15 the elastic perfectly plastic material constitutive model will not always overestimate the ultimate strength for some steel structures the elastic perfectly plastic curve will underestimate the ultimate strength and get a conservative result when the material proportional limit stress is close to 0 2 proof stress or yield stress and the strain hardening take effects before structure reaching into the ultimate limit state the strain hardening will play an important role as the occurrence of buckling is later and a large part of the structure stays at the plastic stage before collapse the specimen t1b3l15 with various thickness is used to study the law of change for the difference between the elastic perfectly plastic curve and the true curve the true stress strain curve of t5 which has a significant non linear property between proportional limit stress and 0 2 proof stress than that of t3 is used in the structure and the thickness of the whole three plates is the same the ultimate strength of structures with different thicknesses and two kinds of material constitutive models are shown in table 8 with the increase of thickness the occurrence of buckling is pushed backward and the effects of strain hardening of the true curve will enhance the ultimate strength of structure with respect to the elastic perfectly plastic curve it is illustrated in table 8 that the elastic perfectly plastic constitutive model is applicable when the thickness is higher than 30 mm and it would get a safe result in numerical calculation of ultimate strength 7 conclusions in this paper the ultimate strength and web local buckling collapse of stiffened columns have been studied with experiments and numerical calculations the results calculated by fe analysis with true stress strain curves the average measured thickness and measured initial geometrical deformation could reach a good agreement with experimental results the analysis of web local buckling and the effects of material constitutive models are concluded as follows 1 the local web buckling took place first and the increasing out of plane deflection on the web caused further deforming on adjacent flange and plate with the increasing of applied load it indicates that not only the web local buckling itself will decrease the ultimate strength but also the enlarged deflections of structures produced by adjacent web local buckling will accelerate the reduction of the ultimate strength of specimens 2 the failure location of specimens under web local buckling collapse is not always in the middle of the longitudinal length due to the irregular multi half wave initial geometrical deflections with varying amplitudes in the web this phenomenon is different from the beam column collapse or the tripping of stiffener 3 the elastic perfectly plastic material constitutive model will not always overestimate the ultimate strength as non linear property between proportional limit stress and 0 2 proof stress of material would reduce the ultimate strength of the specimen it implied that the application of steel with varying tangential modulus and high 0 2 proof stress should be paid more attention and the true constitutive model can not be replaced with elastic perfectly plastic models in the calculations of ultimate strength credit authorship contribution statement hongyuan mei

21447,the effect of regular waves on the flow structure of tandem multiple jets is investigated experimentally in this study the tandem multiple jets are discharged vertically into the wave flow the particle image velocimetry piv technique is employed to measure the flow field of tandem multiple jets the movement of tandem multiple jets in regular waves is defined starting from the orifices as the separated region the mixing region and the mixed region these three regions are distinguished by the mixing point and the mixed point respectively the results show that the wave to jet velocity ratio r wj is the most important parameter to characterize the effect of regular waves on multiple jets affecting the mixing point location the vertical velocity decay and the cross sectional distribution of vertical velocity using curve fitting the formulas estimating the effects of wave to jet velocity ratio r wj on the mixing point location and the vertical velocity decay are derived this study reveals that the regular wave has a positive effect on the mixing and dilution of tandem multiple jets keywords flow structure mixing point vertical velocity decay initial dilution multiple jets regular wave 1 introduction the phenomenon of multiple jets is a kind of complex turbulent flow with various engineering applications many of such applications can be found in the field of ocean or coastal engineering these include sewage discharge via outfalls brine discharge from desalination plants thermal discharge from power plants and dredge material disposal etc all these flows are subjected more or less by the wave which is a prevailing dynamic condition in the marine environment therefore it is of great importance to investigate the behaviours of multiple jets under the effect of waves for guiding the management of these discharges to our knowledge the first attempt describing the wave jet interaction is the simplified experimental description conducted by shuto and ti 1974 they considered a single buoyant plume discharged into a standing wave the dilution rate of the buoyant plume discharge was computed from an empirical formula since then the wave jet system started to be focused on by many researchers from different points of view seeing from the jet it can be vertical horizontal or oblique and it can also be a non buoyant jet a positively buoyant jet or a negatively buoyant jet the vertical jet experiences an increasing upward discharge or decreasing downward discharge in wave momentum when moving forward on the other hand the horizontal jet experiences a relatively stationary wave momentum considering a regular wave condition although the jet may be influenced to varying degrees by buoyancy effects they nevertheless exhibit many features in common with the jets of neutral buoyancy when encountering waves for example the wave drives the jet to oscillate around its centreline and enhances the jet lateral spread chen and hsiao 2018 seeing from the wave the above conclusion can be drawn despite a slight difference in the time averaged velocity distribution between two different conditions whether of regular or random wave xu et al 2014 the entrainment rate of jets in a wave environment is significantly increased by the wave oscillatory motion this results in the jets having faster decay of centreline velocity wider spreading width larger dilution rate and stronger turbulence than those in stagnant water chyan and hwung 1993 koole and swan 1994 mossa 2004 yuan 2007 chen and hsiao 2018 with regard to the jet flow patterns mori and chang 2003 classified the wave induced oscillation into three categories based on the variation of wave to jet momentum ratio r m they are symmetric oscillation with a continuous jet centerline asymmetric oscillation with a continuous jet centerline and asymmetric oscillation with a discontinuous jet centerline regarding the time averaged velocity distribution koole and swan 1994 and xu et al 2014 found that lateral profiles of jet velocity exhibit the sequence of distribution changes i e gaussian flat topped bi peaked with the increase of r m regarding the turbulent properties mossa 2004 2018 and hsiao et al 2011 identified that the turbulence production advection and dissipation terms of jet all increase with the increasing of the wave effect regarding the jet trajectory and dilution chin 1987 1988 tam and li 2008 and sharp et al 2014 used empirical formula or integral model predicting the jet movement and spreading it can be seen that the knowledge on the jet under the effect of waves has been supplied plentifully in the past decades however those understanding is limited to a single jet and the studies on multiple jets in a wave environment are quite lacking the studies on multiple jets in crossflow are referable different arrangement patterns of multiple jets exist in the literature such as tandem jets along the crossflow moawad and rajaratnam 1998 tandem jets normal to the crossflow yu et al 2006 zhang and zhu 2011 and a rosette jet group lai et al 2011 characteristics of the tandem jets along the crossflow are discussed the penetration of the front jet is comparable to that of the single jet in the near field gutmark et al 2011 the front jet has a sheltering effect on the downstream jets leading to a smaller bending degree and a deeper penetration for downstream jets yu et al 2006 li et al 2012 the shielding effect of the front jet will decline with the increasing of adjacent jet spacing li et al 2012 the spread at the leeward side is higher than that at the windward side which is similar to the single jet however the spreads at both sides of rear downstream jets are decreased by the presence of the front jet yu et al 2006 gutmark et al 2011 in the unidirectional crossflow the front jet has a kind of protection effect on the rear jets and decreases the mixing between the upstream crossflow and rear jets it might be different for the multiple jets in the wave environment because the wave dynamic is reciprocating and bidirectional the objective of this research is to present a detailed description of characteristic behaviours of tandem multiple jets under the effect of regular waves via using two dimensional particle image velocimetry piv measurements this manuscript is organised as follows the dimensional analysis and the experimental description are outlined in section 2 section 3 shows the results and discussion on characteristic behaviours of multiple jets in a wave environment summary conclusions are provided in section 4 2 methodology 2 1 dimensional analysis in this study we consider non buoyant multiple jets discharged vertically into a regular wave environment via round orifices the parameters of multiple jets include the initial velocity w 0 inner diameter of the round orifice d and spacing between adjacent jets s 0 the parameters related to regular waves are wave height h wave period t and static water depth h 0 for a single jet in wave environment several non dimensional parameters were used in previous studies mori and chang 2003 ryu et al 2005 chang et al 2009 xu et al 2014 to primarily character the interaction between jet and wave they are listed as follows 1 r m1 ga 2 2dw 0 2 where a is the wave amplitude and g is the acceleration due to gravity 2 r m2 gka 2 2w 0 2 where k is the wave number 3 r wj u w w 0 where u w is the characteristic velocity of wave defined by the maximum horizontal particle velocity at the jet orifice position induced by the wave the first two parameters r m1 and r m2 are momentum ratio between the wave and the jet while the last one r wj is the velocity ratio between the wave and the jet similar with that of a jet in crossflow if the location of the orifice is fixed and the static water depth is unchanged the three ratios are indeed the same except with a different coefficient here we use the wave to jet velocity ratio r wj to describe the interaction between multiple jets and regular waves for the multiple jets another non dimensional parameter might also be considered namely 4 n s0 d the jet diameter d and the spacing s 0 are constant in this study 2 2 experimental setup and experimental cases the experiments were conducted at the college of harbor coastal and offshore engineering hohai university a wave flume that is 46 0 m long 0 5 m wide and 1 0 m deep was used the water depth in the wave flume was set to 0 5 m in the experiments the regular waves were generated by the movement of a computer controlled piston type paddle and were dissipated by an absorber located at the end of the flume the reflection coefficients in this study were tested and less than 5 a wave gauge located at the middle of the second jet and the third jet was used to record the variations of water level after the calibration the target wave height and the target wave period were determined four round pipes made of acrylic material were placed at the centreline of the flume the inner diameter of the pipes was 1 0 cm the jet water was supplied from a constant head tank 4 0 m above the wave flume a flow controlling valve and a flow meter were connected between the constant head tank and the vertical jets to adjust and measure the jet flow rate similar design could be found in the study of tam and li 2008 the multiple jets were discharged vertically via four pipes and the jet orifices are 10 0 cm above the flume bottom the spacing s 0 between the orifices was 5 0 cm namely 5d the sketch of experimental setup is illustrated in fig 1 in this study the three dimensional cartesian coordinate system x y z is defined such that x is the horizontal coordinate that follows the wave direction y is the transverse coordinate and z is the vertical coordinate the origin of the coordinate system is located at the centre of the first jet orifice the four jets in one experimental case are named as jet1 jet2 jet3 and jet4 respectively in total 18 experimental cases were conducted in this study the details of the experimental parameters are shown in table 1 three initial velocities of multiple jets were performed in this study namely 0 265 m s 0 531 m s and 0 643 m s respectively the initial velocity shown here is the mean value of initial velocities of four jets and it will be discussed further in section 3 1 the wave periods were 1 0 s and 1 4 s and the wave heights were 3 0 cm and 6 0 cm 2 3 piv measurements and image processing the two dimensional velocities of the jet on the symmetrical plane y d 0 were measured by using the particle image velocimetry piv technique the piv system used in this study was supplied by the tsi corporation consisting of a nd yag laser and a 14 bit ccd camera with a 2048 2048 pixel resolution the maximum repetition rate of the laser is 15 hz and the maximum energy output is 380mj pulse it was used as the laser light sheet optics illumination source and the light was introduced into the test channel vertically downward through a transparent lid the thickness of the light sheet was 1 mm in the experiment the lid thickness was 1 cm and hence its effect on the flow field was neglected the water was seeded with hollow glass spheres of 10 μm diameter and 1 02 g cm3 density the sampling frequency was set to 14 5 hz and the sampling time was more than 20 times of the wave periods the piv measurements were taken in two fields of view fov the smaller fov focused on the initial region of the jet the size of the smaller fov was 0 12 m 0 12 m and that of the larger one was 0 36 m 0 36 m the maximum time interval δt between the image pair of piv measurement was determined as 6 ms by following the suggestion of keane and adrian 1990 hence there were few tracking particles that could escape laterally from the area illuminated by the light sheet the insight 4g software supported by tsi corporation was used to conduct the image processing the gaussian filter method was adopted to enhance image quality the size of interrogation windows was set to 32 32 pixels with a 50 overlap among adjacent interrogation windows the fast fourier transform fft method and the gaussian peak finding algorithm were chosen in the image processing a zero padded fast fourier transform fft cross correlation and three point gaussian peak finding a local median filter was employed to remove the spurious vectors and the removed vectors were replaced by using the method of interpolation a similar image processing method could be found in hsiao et al 2011 error in piv measurement can arise due to the total number of flow fields used to compute the time average in this study the mean values of velocities were calculated by using the data in 20 wave cycles and those in 30 wave cycles it is found that the difference between the two sets is less than 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 multiple jets in stagnant water the initial velocity of each jet in case mjs1 mjs3 is listed in table 2 it is found that the initial velocities of the front two jets jet1 and jet2 are slightly larger than those of the other two jets jet3 and jet4 which might be related to the energy loss in the pipe the differences between four initial velocities are not larger than 4 for convenience the mean value of four initial velocities is used in the following analysis the time averaged vertical velocity decay along each jet centreline in case sjs1 and mjs2 is illustrated in fig 2 the decay rate of a single jet case sjs1 is consistent well with the empirical formula which is expressed in eq 5 albertson et al 1948 especially when z d is larger than 10 5 w m w 0 6 2 z d 1 where w m is the time averaged vertical velocity on the jet centreline namely the maximum value of vertical velocity on each cross section the agreement between experimental data and empirical formula confirms the reliability of the piv measurement techniques the two jets jet1 and jet2 in case mjs2 have the same distribution of vertical velocity with the single jet in case sjs1 at the region where z d is smaller than 20 it is due to that in this region each jet in case mjs2 is separated from adjacent ones above the level z d 20 the jets in case mjs2 have mixed with each other and as a result the time averaged vertical velocity at each jet centreline is slightly larger than that of a single jet it is noted that the inner jet jet2 has a slower centreline velocity decay than the outer jet jet1 it is due to sheltering effect of the outer jet on the inner jet and hence the inner jet gets less entrainment with surrounding water similar results were obtained by krothapalli et al 1980 when focusing on multiple rectangular jets and by raghunathan and reid 1981 when focusing on multiple circular jets fig 3 shows the time averaged flow field at different levels z d 5 10 15 20 25 30 at the levels close to the jet orifice i e z d 5 10 the vertical velocity profiles of each jet follow the gaussian distribution quite well and the multiple jets are separated from each other which is consistent with the findings in fig 2 at the level z d 15 the jet starts coming in encountering with each other although the encountering still do not affect the vertical velocity on the jet centreline at the levels close to the water surface i e z d 20 25 30 there has a strong interaction among adjacent jets finally no freshwater exists among adjacent jets and they become one jet 3 2 multiple jets in one wave cycle fig 4 shows the phase averaged flow field of multiple jets under the effect of regular wave in case mjw1 c at four typical wave phases namely up zero crossing wave crest down zero crossing and wave trough the phase averaged flow field has subtracted the wave field and hence the velocity distribution of each jet can be seen clearly in fig 4 in one wave cycle each jet sways along with the wave motion at the up zero crossing phase the horizontal velocity of pure wave particle is zero and the vertical velocity of pure wave particle gets the maximum value as shown in fig 4a the jets discharged at this wave phase go upwards vertically while the jet body above the orifices stays on the left side due to the effect of the former wave trough at the wave crest the horizontal velocity of pure wave particle gets the maximum value and each jet gets the largest deflection on the right side fig 4b from the wave crest to the down zero crossing phase the deflection of each jet gets smaller fig 4b to c the jets discharged at the down zero crossing phase go upwards vertically again but the jet body above the orifices stays on the right side due to the effect of the former wave crest at the wave trough each jet gets the largest deflection on the left side fig 4d under the successive effect of the wave each jet presents an s shape the velocity distribution on a typical level z d 5 is chosen to describe the interaction of multiple jets in the wave environment further as shown in fig 4a the jets on z d 5 have just suffered the deflection caused by the wave induced current opposite the wave direction the maximum velocity of individual jet decreases along the wave direction on the contrary the jets on z d 5 in fig 4c have just suffered the deflection caused by the wave induced current in the wave direction the maximum velocity of individual jet increases along the wave direction it implies a shielding effect of windward jet on the leeward jets which is similar to multiple jets in crossflow due to the oscillating of wave induced flow the maximum velocity of jet1 decreases from a large value while the maximum velocity of jet4 increases from a small value as a result the time averaged maximum velocity of jet1 and jet4 is quite close to each other as shown in fig 10d the windward spreading of an individual jet is smaller than its leeward spread on z d 5 the asymmetry in the spreading is due to jet fluid that is stripped away from the windward side by the wave flow and deposited again to the leeward side the jet spreading width b is defined as the distance between the two points at which the velocity ratio w w c w c is the centreline velocity equals to 1 e the jet spreading width on z d 5 in case mjw1 a mjw1 b and mjw1 c at up zero crossing phase is calculated and illustrated in fig 5 it is found that the jet spreading at the windward side is larger than that at the leeward side in all the three cases this is consistent with results obtained by gutmark et al 2011 for twin circular jets in crossflow moreover the jet spreading increases when the wave to jet velocity ratio gets larger this indicates that the wave effect enhances the mixing of jets with the surrounding water 3 3 effect of wave intensity on multiple jets fig 6 shows the phase averaged flow field of multiple jets in case mjw1 a mjw1 b and mjw2 c at the up zero crossing phase by comparing these with that in case mjw1 c the effects of wave to jet velocity ratio r wj are investigated the multiple jets in each case sway back and forth under the effect of waves and the jet body has the left part and the right part in view of the jet centreline the left part is deflected at the wave trough phase and the right part is deflected at the wave crest phase the swaying amplitude of these two parts has a direct relationship with the wave to jet velocity ratio r wj the swaying amplitude in case mjw1 a mjw1 b mjw1 c and mjw2 a mjw2 b mjw2 d is illustrated in fig 7 it is found that the swaying amplitude increases as the wave to jet velocity ratio r wj increases fig 8 shows the swaying amplitude of each individual jet in case mjw1 a mjw1 b and mjw1 c at up zero crossing phase the results show that the swaying amplitudes of four jet have some differences due to the shielding effect of windward jet on the leeward jets the swaying amplitudes of windward jets are always larger than those of leeward jets in case mjw1 a the difference of swaying amplitudes among the four jets is insignificant and the difference becomes larger with the increasing of the wave to jet velocity ratio such as those in case mjw1 b it indicates that the wave effects enhance the interaction between adjacent jets with a positive effect on the mixing of multiple jets four peaks are common for the vertical velocity distribution for present four jets in a regular wave environment however five peaks could also be observed on certain levels of some cases i e case mjw1 b and mjw1 c it is related to the asymmetric and discontinuous pattern of jet oscillating in wave environment especially in cases with larger wave to jet velocity ratio seen in case mjw1 c the wave trough phase the asymmetric and discontinuous patterns of single jet in wave environment were also found by mori and chang 2003 and xu et al 2014 the jet flow patterns in waves were classified into three types symmetric oscillation with a continuous jet centreline type i asymmetric oscillation with a continuous centreline type ii and asymmetric oscillation with a discontinuous centreline type iii mori and chang 2003 with the increase of the wave to jet velocity ratio the jet motion will gradually transform from type i to type ii and then to type iii mori and chang 2003 xu et al 2014 in xu et al 2014 a case of a single jet in regular waves r wj 0 173 type iii was performed using the large eddy simulation method the wave to jet velocity ratio is quite close to that of case mjw1 c in the present study we assume that the phased averaged vertical velocity of multiple jets is the linear superposition of four single jets the lateral profile of the phased averaged vertical velocity of multiple jets is shown in fig 9 considering the effect of different jet spacing it indicates that there are two factors affecting peak numbers namely the wave to jet velocity ratio and the jet spacing the peak numbers might increase with a larger wave to jet velocity ratio and a larger jet spacing as for the five peaks one precondition is that the wave to jet velocity ratio is large enough and the jet flow pattern is an asymmetric oscillation with a discontinuous centreline type iii in the type iii cases more than five peaks will occur if the jet spacing is large enough say s 0 d 12 5 the jet oscillating induced by different wave intensities will further affect the time averaged vertical velocity distribution of multiple jets fig 10 shows the time averaged flow field at different levels z d 5 10 15 20 25 30 in case mjw1 a mjw1 c and mjw2 a mjw2 c at the vertical level z d 5 the swaying amplitude of multiple jets in each case is quite small as shown in fig 7 and hence each vertical velocity distribution has four peaks with the jets moving upward the swaying amplitude gets larger and then the vertical velocity distribution exists three peaks four peaks or five peaks depending on levels and or cases at a certain wave phase i e wave trough the vertical velocity distribution has four or five peaks the time averaging of the vertical velocity at different wave phases will present three peaks four peaks or five peaks at the level of z d 25 and 30 the velocity value between two peaks has little difference with the peak value and it will become one peak after the time averaging calculation 3 4 three regions of multiple jets the movement of tandem multiple jets can be defined starting from the orifices as the separated region the mixing region and the mixed region as shown in fig 11 for the multiple jets in a wave environment each jet gets deflected like a cross jet in the separated region entraining the freshwater at both sides the bounds among adjacent jets are quite clear and each jet moves upwards separately in the mixing region the jets discharged from different orifices begin to overlap and mix with each other and the freshwater among four jets becomes part of multiple jets gradually in the mixed region the four peaks disappear gradually and finally the four jets bleed into one then oscillate along the wave flow field the three regions are distinguished with the mixing point and the mixed location the mixing point is the location where the adjacent jets start to overlap while the mixed location is the position where the four velocity peaks disappear it is quite difficult to determine the exact location of mixed location and only the mixing point is discussed further in this study lee and chu 2003 recommended that the jet visual boundary should be defined by the concentration contour of c 0 25c m where c m is the cross sectional maximum scalar concentration however the concentration field was not measured in this study by comparing the vertical velocity contour and jet visual boundary we found that the vertical velocity contour of w 0 25w m where w m is the maximum vertical velocity on the cross section is quite close to the jet visual boundary taking the wave crest phase in case mjw1 c as an example both the mixing point has a distance around 6 8 cm with the jet orifice shown in fig 11 and table 3 hence the vertical velocity contour of w 0 25w m is considered as the jet visual boundary in this study and the mixing point is defined as the location where the vertical velocity contour of w 0 25w m of two adjacent jets coincide with each other the mixing points of multiple jets in regular waves are shown in table 3 it can be seen that the location of the mixing point at the up zero crossing phase is close to that at the down zero crossing phase and the location of the mixing point at the wave crest phase is close to that at the wave trough phase further the location of the mixing point at the wave crest or wave trough phase is lower than that at the up zero crossing or down crossing phase it results from that the wave has a stronger cross flow effect on the multiple jets at the wave crest or wave trough phase and the interaction between adjacent jets are enhanced nevertheless the mean value of the mixing point location at four wave phases is calculated and listed in table 3 it can be seen that the location of the mixing point gets higher with the decreasing of wave to jet velocity ratio and that the adjacent jets start to interact with each other at a lower location if the wave effects get larger it indicates that the wave has a positive effect on the mixing of adjacent jets the relationship between the mixing point location and the wave to jet velocity ratio are established using the formula 6 z m p d 3 20 r j w 0 46 0 04 r j w 0 34 and it is displayed in fig 12 3 5 vertical velocity decay of multiple jets in regular waves after discharged from the jet orifice the jet body entrains the surrounding water and mixes with this freshwater as a result the vertical velocity decreases when the jet moves upwards due to the interaction among the multiple jets the vertical velocity decay of multiple jets will have much difference with that of a single jet traditionally the vertical velocity decay on the jet centreline could be investigated as a characteristic behaviour however as shown in fig 10 the vertical velocity on each jet centreline might be a peak or not hence it is not suitable to represent the vertical velocity decay and instead the maximum value of vertical velocity on each cross section is chosen in this study the maximum vertical velocity decay of multiple jets in regular wave environment case mjw2 a and mjw2 c and that of a single jet in regular waves case sjw1 and sjw2 are illustrated in fig 13 despite the shielding effect of windward jets on the leeward jets a slight difference could be found between the single jet and the multiple jets at the region quite close to the jet orifice z d 5 and above the vertical level z d 5 the maximum vertical velocity of multiple jets is larger than that of a single jet it shows that the single jet has a faster vertical velocity decay compared with the multiple jets which indicates that each jet in the multiple jets could entrain less water into the jet body than the single jet does then the effect of wave to jet velocity ratio on the vertical velocity decay is investigated and the results of vertical velocity decay in case mjw1 a mjw1 d and mjw2 a mjw2 d are illustrated in fig 14 it shows that the vertical velocity decays faster with the increasing of wave to jet velocity ratio indicating that the wave has a positive effect on the mixing of multiple jets then the normalized vertical velocity is divided by the dimensionless parameter r jw 0 5 it yields fig 15 in which the coordinate system is changed to the logarithmic form it is found that the wave to jet velocity ratio can accurately represent the

21447,the effect of regular waves on the flow structure of tandem multiple jets is investigated experimentally in this study the tandem multiple jets are discharged vertically into the wave flow the particle image velocimetry piv technique is employed to measure the flow field of tandem multiple jets the movement of tandem multiple jets in regular waves is defined starting from the orifices as the separated region the mixing region and the mixed region these three regions are distinguished by the mixing point and the mixed point respectively the results show that the wave to jet velocity ratio r wj is the most important parameter to characterize the effect of regular waves on multiple jets affecting the mixing point location the vertical velocity decay and the cross sectional distribution of vertical velocity using curve fitting the formulas estimating the effects of wave to jet velocity ratio r wj on the mixing point location and the vertical velocity decay are derived this study reveals that the regular wave has a positive effect on the mixing and dilution of tandem multiple jets keywords flow structure mixing point vertical velocity decay initial dilution multiple jets regular wave 1 introduction the phenomenon of multiple jets is a kind of complex turbulent flow with various engineering applications many of such applications can be found in the field of ocean or coastal engineering these include sewage discharge via outfalls brine discharge from desalination plants thermal discharge from power plants and dredge material disposal etc all these flows are subjected more or less by the wave which is a prevailing dynamic condition in the marine environment therefore it is of great importance to investigate the behaviours of multiple jets under the effect of waves for guiding the management of these discharges to our knowledge the first attempt describing the wave jet interaction is the simplified experimental description conducted by shuto and ti 1974 they considered a single buoyant plume discharged into a standing wave the dilution rate of the buoyant plume discharge was computed from an empirical formula since then the wave jet system started to be focused on by many researchers from different points of view seeing from the jet it can be vertical horizontal or oblique and it can also be a non buoyant jet a positively buoyant jet or a negatively buoyant jet the vertical jet experiences an increasing upward discharge or decreasing downward discharge in wave momentum when moving forward on the other hand the horizontal jet experiences a relatively stationary wave momentum considering a regular wave condition although the jet may be influenced to varying degrees by buoyancy effects they nevertheless exhibit many features in common with the jets of neutral buoyancy when encountering waves for example the wave drives the jet to oscillate around its centreline and enhances the jet lateral spread chen and hsiao 2018 seeing from the wave the above conclusion can be drawn despite a slight difference in the time averaged velocity distribution between two different conditions whether of regular or random wave xu et al 2014 the entrainment rate of jets in a wave environment is significantly increased by the wave oscillatory motion this results in the jets having faster decay of centreline velocity wider spreading width larger dilution rate and stronger turbulence than those in stagnant water chyan and hwung 1993 koole and swan 1994 mossa 2004 yuan 2007 chen and hsiao 2018 with regard to the jet flow patterns mori and chang 2003 classified the wave induced oscillation into three categories based on the variation of wave to jet momentum ratio r m they are symmetric oscillation with a continuous jet centerline asymmetric oscillation with a continuous jet centerline and asymmetric oscillation with a discontinuous jet centerline regarding the time averaged velocity distribution koole and swan 1994 and xu et al 2014 found that lateral profiles of jet velocity exhibit the sequence of distribution changes i e gaussian flat topped bi peaked with the increase of r m regarding the turbulent properties mossa 2004 2018 and hsiao et al 2011 identified that the turbulence production advection and dissipation terms of jet all increase with the increasing of the wave effect regarding the jet trajectory and dilution chin 1987 1988 tam and li 2008 and sharp et al 2014 used empirical formula or integral model predicting the jet movement and spreading it can be seen that the knowledge on the jet under the effect of waves has been supplied plentifully in the past decades however those understanding is limited to a single jet and the studies on multiple jets in a wave environment are quite lacking the studies on multiple jets in crossflow are referable different arrangement patterns of multiple jets exist in the literature such as tandem jets along the crossflow moawad and rajaratnam 1998 tandem jets normal to the crossflow yu et al 2006 zhang and zhu 2011 and a rosette jet group lai et al 2011 characteristics of the tandem jets along the crossflow are discussed the penetration of the front jet is comparable to that of the single jet in the near field gutmark et al 2011 the front jet has a sheltering effect on the downstream jets leading to a smaller bending degree and a deeper penetration for downstream jets yu et al 2006 li et al 2012 the shielding effect of the front jet will decline with the increasing of adjacent jet spacing li et al 2012 the spread at the leeward side is higher than that at the windward side which is similar to the single jet however the spreads at both sides of rear downstream jets are decreased by the presence of the front jet yu et al 2006 gutmark et al 2011 in the unidirectional crossflow the front jet has a kind of protection effect on the rear jets and decreases the mixing between the upstream crossflow and rear jets it might be different for the multiple jets in the wave environment because the wave dynamic is reciprocating and bidirectional the objective of this research is to present a detailed description of characteristic behaviours of tandem multiple jets under the effect of regular waves via using two dimensional particle image velocimetry piv measurements this manuscript is organised as follows the dimensional analysis and the experimental description are outlined in section 2 section 3 shows the results and discussion on characteristic behaviours of multiple jets in a wave environment summary conclusions are provided in section 4 2 methodology 2 1 dimensional analysis in this study we consider non buoyant multiple jets discharged vertically into a regular wave environment via round orifices the parameters of multiple jets include the initial velocity w 0 inner diameter of the round orifice d and spacing between adjacent jets s 0 the parameters related to regular waves are wave height h wave period t and static water depth h 0 for a single jet in wave environment several non dimensional parameters were used in previous studies mori and chang 2003 ryu et al 2005 chang et al 2009 xu et al 2014 to primarily character the interaction between jet and wave they are listed as follows 1 r m1 ga 2 2dw 0 2 where a is the wave amplitude and g is the acceleration due to gravity 2 r m2 gka 2 2w 0 2 where k is the wave number 3 r wj u w w 0 where u w is the characteristic velocity of wave defined by the maximum horizontal particle velocity at the jet orifice position induced by the wave the first two parameters r m1 and r m2 are momentum ratio between the wave and the jet while the last one r wj is the velocity ratio between the wave and the jet similar with that of a jet in crossflow if the location of the orifice is fixed and the static water depth is unchanged the three ratios are indeed the same except with a different coefficient here we use the wave to jet velocity ratio r wj to describe the interaction between multiple jets and regular waves for the multiple jets another non dimensional parameter might also be considered namely 4 n s0 d the jet diameter d and the spacing s 0 are constant in this study 2 2 experimental setup and experimental cases the experiments were conducted at the college of harbor coastal and offshore engineering hohai university a wave flume that is 46 0 m long 0 5 m wide and 1 0 m deep was used the water depth in the wave flume was set to 0 5 m in the experiments the regular waves were generated by the movement of a computer controlled piston type paddle and were dissipated by an absorber located at the end of the flume the reflection coefficients in this study were tested and less than 5 a wave gauge located at the middle of the second jet and the third jet was used to record the variations of water level after the calibration the target wave height and the target wave period were determined four round pipes made of acrylic material were placed at the centreline of the flume the inner diameter of the pipes was 1 0 cm the jet water was supplied from a constant head tank 4 0 m above the wave flume a flow controlling valve and a flow meter were connected between the constant head tank and the vertical jets to adjust and measure the jet flow rate similar design could be found in the study of tam and li 2008 the multiple jets were discharged vertically via four pipes and the jet orifices are 10 0 cm above the flume bottom the spacing s 0 between the orifices was 5 0 cm namely 5d the sketch of experimental setup is illustrated in fig 1 in this study the three dimensional cartesian coordinate system x y z is defined such that x is the horizontal coordinate that follows the wave direction y is the transverse coordinate and z is the vertical coordinate the origin of the coordinate system is located at the centre of the first jet orifice the four jets in one experimental case are named as jet1 jet2 jet3 and jet4 respectively in total 18 experimental cases were conducted in this study the details of the experimental parameters are shown in table 1 three initial velocities of multiple jets were performed in this study namely 0 265 m s 0 531 m s and 0 643 m s respectively the initial velocity shown here is the mean value of initial velocities of four jets and it will be discussed further in section 3 1 the wave periods were 1 0 s and 1 4 s and the wave heights were 3 0 cm and 6 0 cm 2 3 piv measurements and image processing the two dimensional velocities of the jet on the symmetrical plane y d 0 were measured by using the particle image velocimetry piv technique the piv system used in this study was supplied by the tsi corporation consisting of a nd yag laser and a 14 bit ccd camera with a 2048 2048 pixel resolution the maximum repetition rate of the laser is 15 hz and the maximum energy output is 380mj pulse it was used as the laser light sheet optics illumination source and the light was introduced into the test channel vertically downward through a transparent lid the thickness of the light sheet was 1 mm in the experiment the lid thickness was 1 cm and hence its effect on the flow field was neglected the water was seeded with hollow glass spheres of 10 μm diameter and 1 02 g cm3 density the sampling frequency was set to 14 5 hz and the sampling time was more than 20 times of the wave periods the piv measurements were taken in two fields of view fov the smaller fov focused on the initial region of the jet the size of the smaller fov was 0 12 m 0 12 m and that of the larger one was 0 36 m 0 36 m the maximum time interval δt between the image pair of piv measurement was determined as 6 ms by following the suggestion of keane and adrian 1990 hence there were few tracking particles that could escape laterally from the area illuminated by the light sheet the insight 4g software supported by tsi corporation was used to conduct the image processing the gaussian filter method was adopted to enhance image quality the size of interrogation windows was set to 32 32 pixels with a 50 overlap among adjacent interrogation windows the fast fourier transform fft method and the gaussian peak finding algorithm were chosen in the image processing a zero padded fast fourier transform fft cross correlation and three point gaussian peak finding a local median filter was employed to remove the spurious vectors and the removed vectors were replaced by using the method of interpolation a similar image processing method could be found in hsiao et al 2011 error in piv measurement can arise due to the total number of flow fields used to compute the time average in this study the mean values of velocities were calculated by using the data in 20 wave cycles and those in 30 wave cycles it is found that the difference between the two sets is less than 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 multiple jets in stagnant water the initial velocity of each jet in case mjs1 mjs3 is listed in table 2 it is found that the initial velocities of the front two jets jet1 and jet2 are slightly larger than those of the other two jets jet3 and jet4 which might be related to the energy loss in the pipe the differences between four initial velocities are not larger than 4 for convenience the mean value of four initial velocities is used in the following analysis the time averaged vertical velocity decay along each jet centreline in case sjs1 and mjs2 is illustrated in fig 2 the decay rate of a single jet case sjs1 is consistent well with the empirical formula which is expressed in eq 5 albertson et al 1948 especially when z d is larger than 10 5 w m w 0 6 2 z d 1 where w m is the time averaged vertical velocity on the jet centreline namely the maximum value of vertical velocity on each cross section the agreement between experimental data and empirical formula confirms the reliability of the piv measurement techniques the two jets jet1 and jet2 in case mjs2 have the same distribution of vertical velocity with the single jet in case sjs1 at the region where z d is smaller than 20 it is due to that in this region each jet in case mjs2 is separated from adjacent ones above the level z d 20 the jets in case mjs2 have mixed with each other and as a result the time averaged vertical velocity at each jet centreline is slightly larger than that of a single jet it is noted that the inner jet jet2 has a slower centreline velocity decay than the outer jet jet1 it is due to sheltering effect of the outer jet on the inner jet and hence the inner jet gets less entrainment with surrounding water similar results were obtained by krothapalli et al 1980 when focusing on multiple rectangular jets and by raghunathan and reid 1981 when focusing on multiple circular jets fig 3 shows the time averaged flow field at different levels z d 5 10 15 20 25 30 at the levels close to the jet orifice i e z d 5 10 the vertical velocity profiles of each jet follow the gaussian distribution quite well and the multiple jets are separated from each other which is consistent with the findings in fig 2 at the level z d 15 the jet starts coming in encountering with each other although the encountering still do not affect the vertical velocity on the jet centreline at the levels close to the water surface i e z d 20 25 30 there has a strong interaction among adjacent jets finally no freshwater exists among adjacent jets and they become one jet 3 2 multiple jets in one wave cycle fig 4 shows the phase averaged flow field of multiple jets under the effect of regular wave in case mjw1 c at four typical wave phases namely up zero crossing wave crest down zero crossing and wave trough the phase averaged flow field has subtracted the wave field and hence the velocity distribution of each jet can be seen clearly in fig 4 in one wave cycle each jet sways along with the wave motion at the up zero crossing phase the horizontal velocity of pure wave particle is zero and the vertical velocity of pure wave particle gets the maximum value as shown in fig 4a the jets discharged at this wave phase go upwards vertically while the jet body above the orifices stays on the left side due to the effect of the former wave trough at the wave crest the horizontal velocity of pure wave particle gets the maximum value and each jet gets the largest deflection on the right side fig 4b from the wave crest to the down zero crossing phase the deflection of each jet gets smaller fig 4b to c the jets discharged at the down zero crossing phase go upwards vertically again but the jet body above the orifices stays on the right side due to the effect of the former wave crest at the wave trough each jet gets the largest deflection on the left side fig 4d under the successive effect of the wave each jet presents an s shape the velocity distribution on a typical level z d 5 is chosen to describe the interaction of multiple jets in the wave environment further as shown in fig 4a the jets on z d 5 have just suffered the deflection caused by the wave induced current opposite the wave direction the maximum velocity of individual jet decreases along the wave direction on the contrary the jets on z d 5 in fig 4c have just suffered the deflection caused by the wave induced current in the wave direction the maximum velocity of individual jet increases along the wave direction it implies a shielding effect of windward jet on the leeward jets which is similar to multiple jets in crossflow due to the oscillating of wave induced flow the maximum velocity of jet1 decreases from a large value while the maximum velocity of jet4 increases from a small value as a result the time averaged maximum velocity of jet1 and jet4 is quite close to each other as shown in fig 10d the windward spreading of an individual jet is smaller than its leeward spread on z d 5 the asymmetry in the spreading is due to jet fluid that is stripped away from the windward side by the wave flow and deposited again to the leeward side the jet spreading width b is defined as the distance between the two points at which the velocity ratio w w c w c is the centreline velocity equals to 1 e the jet spreading width on z d 5 in case mjw1 a mjw1 b and mjw1 c at up zero crossing phase is calculated and illustrated in fig 5 it is found that the jet spreading at the windward side is larger than that at the leeward side in all the three cases this is consistent with results obtained by gutmark et al 2011 for twin circular jets in crossflow moreover the jet spreading increases when the wave to jet velocity ratio gets larger this indicates that the wave effect enhances the mixing of jets with the surrounding water 3 3 effect of wave intensity on multiple jets fig 6 shows the phase averaged flow field of multiple jets in case mjw1 a mjw1 b and mjw2 c at the up zero crossing phase by comparing these with that in case mjw1 c the effects of wave to jet velocity ratio r wj are investigated the multiple jets in each case sway back and forth under the effect of waves and the jet body has the left part and the right part in view of the jet centreline the left part is deflected at the wave trough phase and the right part is deflected at the wave crest phase the swaying amplitude of these two parts has a direct relationship with the wave to jet velocity ratio r wj the swaying amplitude in case mjw1 a mjw1 b mjw1 c and mjw2 a mjw2 b mjw2 d is illustrated in fig 7 it is found that the swaying amplitude increases as the wave to jet velocity ratio r wj increases fig 8 shows the swaying amplitude of each individual jet in case mjw1 a mjw1 b and mjw1 c at up zero crossing phase the results show that the swaying amplitudes of four jet have some differences due to the shielding effect of windward jet on the leeward jets the swaying amplitudes of windward jets are always larger than those of leeward jets in case mjw1 a the difference of swaying amplitudes among the four jets is insignificant and the difference becomes larger with the increasing of the wave to jet velocity ratio such as those in case mjw1 b it indicates that the wave effects enhance the interaction between adjacent jets with a positive effect on the mixing of multiple jets four peaks are common for the vertical velocity distribution for present four jets in a regular wave environment however five peaks could also be observed on certain levels of some cases i e case mjw1 b and mjw1 c it is related to the asymmetric and discontinuous pattern of jet oscillating in wave environment especially in cases with larger wave to jet velocity ratio seen in case mjw1 c the wave trough phase the asymmetric and discontinuous patterns of single jet in wave environment were also found by mori and chang 2003 and xu et al 2014 the jet flow patterns in waves were classified into three types symmetric oscillation with a continuous jet centreline type i asymmetric oscillation with a continuous centreline type ii and asymmetric oscillation with a discontinuous centreline type iii mori and chang 2003 with the increase of the wave to jet velocity ratio the jet motion will gradually transform from type i to type ii and then to type iii mori and chang 2003 xu et al 2014 in xu et al 2014 a case of a single jet in regular waves r wj 0 173 type iii was performed using the large eddy simulation method the wave to jet velocity ratio is quite close to that of case mjw1 c in the present study we assume that the phased averaged vertical velocity of multiple jets is the linear superposition of four single jets the lateral profile of the phased averaged vertical velocity of multiple jets is shown in fig 9 considering the effect of different jet spacing it indicates that there are two factors affecting peak numbers namely the wave to jet velocity ratio and the jet spacing the peak numbers might increase with a larger wave to jet velocity ratio and a larger jet spacing as for the five peaks one precondition is that the wave to jet velocity ratio is large enough and the jet flow pattern is an asymmetric oscillation with a discontinuous centreline type iii in the type iii cases more than five peaks will occur if the jet spacing is large enough say s 0 d 12 5 the jet oscillating induced by different wave intensities will further affect the time averaged vertical velocity distribution of multiple jets fig 10 shows the time averaged flow field at different levels z d 5 10 15 20 25 30 in case mjw1 a mjw1 c and mjw2 a mjw2 c at the vertical level z d 5 the swaying amplitude of multiple jets in each case is quite small as shown in fig 7 and hence each vertical velocity distribution has four peaks with the jets moving upward the swaying amplitude gets larger and then the vertical velocity distribution exists three peaks four peaks or five peaks depending on levels and or cases at a certain wave phase i e wave trough the vertical velocity distribution has four or five peaks the time averaging of the vertical velocity at different wave phases will present three peaks four peaks or five peaks at the level of z d 25 and 30 the velocity value between two peaks has little difference with the peak value and it will become one peak after the time averaging calculation 3 4 three regions of multiple jets the movement of tandem multiple jets can be defined starting from the orifices as the separated region the mixing region and the mixed region as shown in fig 11 for the multiple jets in a wave environment each jet gets deflected like a cross jet in the separated region entraining the freshwater at both sides the bounds among adjacent jets are quite clear and each jet moves upwards separately in the mixing region the jets discharged from different orifices begin to overlap and mix with each other and the freshwater among four jets becomes part of multiple jets gradually in the mixed region the four peaks disappear gradually and finally the four jets bleed into one then oscillate along the wave flow field the three regions are distinguished with the mixing point and the mixed location the mixing point is the location where the adjacent jets start to overlap while the mixed location is the position where the four velocity peaks disappear it is quite difficult to determine the exact location of mixed location and only the mixing point is discussed further in this study lee and chu 2003 recommended that the jet visual boundary should be defined by the concentration contour of c 0 25c m where c m is the cross sectional maximum scalar concentration however the concentration field was not measured in this study by comparing the vertical velocity contour and jet visual boundary we found that the vertical velocity contour of w 0 25w m where w m is the maximum vertical velocity on the cross section is quite close to the jet visual boundary taking the wave crest phase in case mjw1 c as an example both the mixing point has a distance around 6 8 cm with the jet orifice shown in fig 11 and table 3 hence the vertical velocity contour of w 0 25w m is considered as the jet visual boundary in this study and the mixing point is defined as the location where the vertical velocity contour of w 0 25w m of two adjacent jets coincide with each other the mixing points of multiple jets in regular waves are shown in table 3 it can be seen that the location of the mixing point at the up zero crossing phase is close to that at the down zero crossing phase and the location of the mixing point at the wave crest phase is close to that at the wave trough phase further the location of the mixing point at the wave crest or wave trough phase is lower than that at the up zero crossing or down crossing phase it results from that the wave has a stronger cross flow effect on the multiple jets at the wave crest or wave trough phase and the interaction between adjacent jets are enhanced nevertheless the mean value of the mixing point location at four wave phases is calculated and listed in table 3 it can be seen that the location of the mixing point gets higher with the decreasing of wave to jet velocity ratio and that the adjacent jets start to interact with each other at a lower location if the wave effects get larger it indicates that the wave has a positive effect on the mixing of adjacent jets the relationship between the mixing point location and the wave to jet velocity ratio are established using the formula 6 z m p d 3 20 r j w 0 46 0 04 r j w 0 34 and it is displayed in fig 12 3 5 vertical velocity decay of multiple jets in regular waves after discharged from the jet orifice the jet body entrains the surrounding water and mixes with this freshwater as a result the vertical velocity decreases when the jet moves upwards due to the interaction among the multiple jets the vertical velocity decay of multiple jets will have much difference with that of a single jet traditionally the vertical velocity decay on the jet centreline could be investigated as a characteristic behaviour however as shown in fig 10 the vertical velocity on each jet centreline might be a peak or not hence it is not suitable to represent the vertical velocity decay and instead the maximum value of vertical velocity on each cross section is chosen in this study the maximum vertical velocity decay of multiple jets in regular wave environment case mjw2 a and mjw2 c and that of a single jet in regular waves case sjw1 and sjw2 are illustrated in fig 13 despite the shielding effect of windward jets on the leeward jets a slight difference could be found between the single jet and the multiple jets at the region quite close to the jet orifice z d 5 and above the vertical level z d 5 the maximum vertical velocity of multiple jets is larger than that of a single jet it shows that the single jet has a faster vertical velocity decay compared with the multiple jets which indicates that each jet in the multiple jets could entrain less water into the jet body than the single jet does then the effect of wave to jet velocity ratio on the vertical velocity decay is investigated and the results of vertical velocity decay in case mjw1 a mjw1 d and mjw2 a mjw2 d are illustrated in fig 14 it shows that the vertical velocity decays faster with the increasing of wave to jet velocity ratio indicating that the wave has a positive effect on the mixing of multiple jets then the normalized vertical velocity is divided by the dimensionless parameter r jw 0 5 it yields fig 15 in which the coordinate system is changed to the logarithmic form it is found that the wave to jet velocity ratio can accurately represent the influence of regular waves on the vertical velocity decay of multiple jets using the least square fitting method the formula for the vertical velocity decay of multiple jets in regular wave environment is expressed by 7 w m w 0 r j w 0 5 0 149 z d 0 65 0 04 r j w 0 34 and it is also shown in fig 15 the 95 confidence bounds of free coefficients are 0 146 0 152 and 0 67 0 63 respectively in this study the spacing of multiple jets is fixed as 5 times the jet diameter the spacing will also have a significant influence on the characteristic behaviours of multiple jets in regular waves further studies should be conducted in future works 4 conclusion in this study a detailed description of characteristic behaviours of tandem multiple jets under the effect of regular waves is presented via using two dimensional particle image velocimetry piv measurements the main conclusion is summarized as follows 1 the multiple jets sway back and forth under the effect of regular waves the swaying amplitude of multiple jets gets larger with the increasing of wave to jet velocity ratio under the successive effect of the wave each jet presents an s shape when facing the wave induced flow the windward jet has a shielding effect on the leeward jets the wave has a positive effect on the mixing of adjacent jets 2 five peaks could be observed on the cross sectional profiles of phase averaged vertical velocity in the cases with a large wave to jet velocity ratio which is related to the asymmetric and or discontinuous pattern of jet oscillating in a wave environment the time

separated region the mixing region and the mixed region each jet gets deflected like a cross jet in the separated region the jets discharged from different orifices begin to overlap and mixing with each other in the mixing region and the four jets bleed into one and oscillate along with the wave in the mixed region the mixing point location defined as the bound between the separated region and the mixing region has a clear relationship with the wave to jet velocity ratio z m p d 3 20 r j w 0 46 0 04 r j w 0 34 4 the vertical velocity of multiple jets in regular waves decays faster than that of a single jet in regular waves the vertical velocity decays faster with the increasing of wave to jet velocity ratio the wave to jet velocity ratio can accurately represent the influence of regular

should be mentioned that the jet orifice spacing also has a significant effect on the movement and mixing of multiple jets in regular waves further study is recommended for such cases credit

energy has some obvious advantages such as high energy density predictable stable rich reserves and wide distribution fraenkel 2002 so the marine current energy can also be used for generating electricity based on the principles similar to those used in wind power generation almost any wind power generation device can be transformed into current energy generation device similar to the wind turbine the main marine current energy generation devices can be classified into horizontal axis tidal turbine hatt and vertical axis tidal turbine vatt compared with hatt research and development of vatt lags behind because of the complex flow structure and periodic unsteady separation flow occurs around the blades but for the advantage in multi direction feasibility easy installation and low maintenance cost vatt is attracting more attention by researchers yang and lawn 2011 wang et al 2016 lundin et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 the lanchester betz joukowsky limit okulov and van kuik 2012 is the energy utilization limit recognized by the turbine designers the betz limit indicates that only 16 27 of the inflow kinetic energy can be transferred into the available shaft power of the turbine the betz limit has also become a target for the design and optimization of high performance and high efficiency turbine the power coefficient for the current horizontal axis turbine is around 40 45 and 40 for the current vertical axis turbine around its optimal tip speed ratio tsr so it can be known from the betz limit the power coefficient of turbines has a gap to improve for the periodic and unsteady large separation flow occurs on the blade for vawt which limits the improvement of the power coefficient efficient control methods to suppress and delay flow separation on blade have been studied by many scholars zhu et al 2018 ma et al 2018 ostos et al 2019 wang and zhuang 2017 li et al 2018 jiang et al 2015 has derived the differential equations of power torque lift and thrust of blade element using the blade element theory it is found that the power and torque of the ideal wind turbine are functions of the tip speed ratio and the lift drag ratio when the lift drag ratio and the tip speed ratio approach to infinity power coefficient of the ideal wind turbine can be reached to the betz limit as the tip speed ratio cannot be infinity for the limit of the structure and operating environment therefore it is an effective solution to enhance the power coefficient by reducing the drag on the airfoil and increase the lift drag ratio to improve the power coefficient inspired from nature super hydrophobic surface shs has been proved to reduce the drag on solid walls in water by numerical and experimental studies martell et al 2010 truesdell et al 2006 lee et al 2016 this kind of bionic material can be made by many different chemical or mechanical techniques the slip effect on the micro scale of shs is the main factor for the drag reduction many studies have been reported the significant drag reduction by shs in both laminar and turbulent channel flows davis and lauga 2010 jung and bhushan 2009 jeffs et al 2010 saadat bakhsh saadat bakhsh et al 2017 conducted numerical study in a fully developed turbulent channel flow with a streamwise super hydrophobic grooves the drag reduction by the super hydrophobic surface was nearly 26 for shear free surface w to the non slip d wall w d 3 you et al you and moin 2007 studied the hydrophobic surfaces on the effect of the drag and lift on a circular cylinder at re 300 and re 3900 it is found that at low reynolds numbers hydrophobic surfaces are not effective in altering the separation angle and base pressure in the shear layer transition regime of re 3900 hydrophobic surfaces drastically delay the separation point further downstream and significantly reduce the drag and rms lift ren et al 2018 conducted a two dimensional 2d numerical simulation of a rotating circular cylinder with shs shs could increase vortex shedding frequency reduce the maximum lift acting on the cylinder and suppress the fluctuation of both drag and lift force in vortex shedding regimes however shs could reduce the drag of the cylinder in the vortex shedding regimes while enhancing it in the steady state for the intermediate rotation rates lee et al 2018 investigated the effects of super hydrophobic surface on the flow around an naca0012 hydrofoil by experiment study at re 0 2 1 0 104 it is found that the superhydrophobic surface imposes a little influence on the wake behind the hydrofoil when the angle of attack is ver low attached flow or high fully separated flow but for the intermedia angles of attack the flow over superhydrophobic surface has a stronger turbulence and can reduce the vortex formation length vajdi hokmabad et al vajdi hokmabad and ghaemi 2016 conducted piv measurement on the superhydrophobic surface with and without gas film between the solid wall and liquid flow under the artificially excited turbulence condition the results showed that the slip effect can only be occurred when a stable gas film exists on the superhydrophobic surface however the gas film on the superhydrophobic micro structure surface is fragile and not mechanically stable over time under flow condition truesdell et al 2006 measured the shear flow near a cylinder rotor with rectangular micro structure hydrophobic surface it is found that the gas film can be disappeared when the surface tension is not enough to prevent the liquid from wetting the hydrophobic micro groove therefore many researchers have focus on the investigation on the formation and maintenance of the gas film on the hydrophobic surface to enhance the slip effect boreyko and chen 2009 barthlott et al 2016 jagdish et al 2014 have found the relatively stable gas film can be deposited on the plate with a 40 μm width hydrophobic micro structure which indicates that the stability of the gas film can be enhanced by reasonably designing the micro structure of the hydrophobic surface kwon et al 2014 have found that the isolated and discontinuous bubbles on the hydrophobic wall can also significantly affect the velocity distribution and the drag reduction can reach to about 10 can be seen that even the discontinuous bubble gas film can obtain considerable drag reduction at present researches and applications of super hydrophobic surface are mostly focus on the internal flows the effects on the external flow are not studied detailed and systematically based on the drag reduction caused by the slip effect on the super hydrophobic surface the numerical simulation of vatt with super hydrophobic surface is carried out in this paper as the main purpose of this paper is conducting theoretical numerical investigation to evaluate the slip effect of the super hydrophobic surface on the vatt aerodynamic performance instead of the detailed flow condition in the actual super hydrophobic micro structure so the gas film and slip effect formed by the super hydrophobic surface are assumed to be stable the influence of inflow velocity number of blades and solidity on vatt with shs is studied which can provide certain guidance and reference for the design and research of super hydrophobic hydraulic machines 2 methodology and model validation 2 1 aerodynamic parameters of vat and super hydrophobic surface tip speed ratio tsr is the ratio of the tangential speed of the blade to the actual velocity of the free stream it is one of the most important parameters for the vertical axis turbine tsr can be represented as λ 1 λ v t v where v is the free stream velocity v t is the tangential speed of the blade 2 v t ω r 2 π n 60 r where r is rotating radius of the turbine ω is the angular velocity of the rotating blades n is the rotating speed the solidity of vertical axis turbine can be expressed as σ nc r where n is blade number of the turbine c is the chord length of the airfoils the power coefficient which can be used to evaluate the wind turbine efficiency is defined as 3 c p t b l a d e ω 1 2 m v 2 where t b l a d e is the torque generated by the resultant force of the differential pressure and viscous force for the super hydrophobic surface investigated in this paper only the water flow is considered the characteristic of the super hydrophobic surface is realized by the boundary condition of the solid surface in microcosmic way the gas liquid surface can be simplified as the shear stress free boundary and the solid liquid surface is still treated as the non slip wall therefore the super hydrophobic surface can be simplified as the alternate with shear free surface and the non slip wall as shown in fig 1 a the shear free surface for the gas liquid interface is defined as a zero shear stress boundary gas fraction which can be a characteristic parameter to describe the super hydrophobic surface is defined as 4 gf p w p where p is the pitch length w is the width of the micro grate the effective slip length can be a useful parameter to reflect and measure the effect of the super hydrophobic surface on the drag and flow on around the airfoil the slip boundary can be defined as 5 u s δ u y 2 2 model validation 2d simulation of a vertical axis wind turbine vawt with three naca0021 airfoils was chosen for validation of the simulation methods applied in this paper the main geometrical parameters for the vawt model are listed in table 1 the referred experiment data is taken from the 3d measurement conducted by castelli castelli et al 2011 the simulation domain and flow boundary condition is shown in fig 2 velocity inlet is set at 40 times of the rotor diameter and the pressure outlet is set at 60d to ignore the influence of the boundary conditions the entire flow domain is filled with unstructured mesh and structured o type mesh is generated and refined around airfoils to meet the requirement of the turbulence model and y on the endwall the mesh for the rotating domain and around airfoils are illustrated in fig 3 the same geometry is adopted for the vertical axis tidal turbine vatt with the variation of the inflow velocities mesh independency study and influence of nodes number on the airfoil is considered as shown in table 2 three cases with 201 341 and 501 nodes on airfoils are discussed fig 4 shows the comparison of torque coefficient during one rotor revolution with three blades by different mesh nodes on airfoil at tsr 2 64 as can be seen the torque coefficient is underestimated by the coarse mesh as the grid nodes is further refined the computed power coefficient and the torque coefficient curves remain almost the same for the medium mesh with the fine mesh the total grid number with 204 378 and 341 nodes on the airfoil is chosen for the conventional vatt in this paper turbulence models with three k ω models and three k ε models are studied and compared with the experiment which can be seen in fig 5 transition sst standard k ε and rng k ε model fail to capture the optimal tsr of the vawt the overestimation of the 2d simulation results obtained by sst k ω model with the experiment is mainly due to the limits of a 2d model which ignores the 3d effects such as tip vortex and pressure distribution along the 3d blade and it is reasonable that the values of power coefficient cp obtained with the 2d computer simulation are higher than the values measured in the experiment so the cp curve obtained by standard k ε model at high tsrs is even lower than the 3d experiment data which is unreasonable for the 2d simulation considering sst k w model is formed by combining k ω and k ε models which allows the sst k w model shows very good capability for simulating flow with great adverse pressure gradients and separating flow menter et al 2003 and the overall trend of tsr curve and the value of optimal tsr of vawt captured are consistent with the experimental results the two equation sst k ω model is chosen as the turbulence model for the simulation 2 3 verification of the super hydrophobic surface model as the super hydrophobic surface is given as the alternate surface with non slip wall and shear free surface verification of the super hydrophobic surface model on naca0021 airfoil at re c 300 000 with p c 0 02 at angle of attack α 0 is conducted with the literature data obtained in laminar and turbulent channel flows maynes et al 2007 park et al 2013 as can be seen from fig 6 a similar functional relationship can be found for the super hydrophobic surface on naca0021 airfoil and the channel flows the drag reduction normalized to the drag on the conventional airfoil surface and the effective slip length all increase with the gf value the magnitude difference from the literature is mainly due to the reynolds number and the flow condition such as in the internal flow and in the external flow so the alternate surface with non slip wall and shear free surface can be an effective way to define the super hydrophobic surface once the gf value is given different combinations of p and w as well as the number of the pitches can be existed for the super hydrophobic surface in order to determine and consider the influence of the pitch value p p c 0 01 0 02 0 04 and 0 2 are studied on vatt with gf 0 5 fig 7 a shows the computing average power coefficient of vatt with different super hydrophobic surface pitch value on airfoils with p c decreases the power coefficient at all tsrs converges the difference of the power coefficient between p c 0 02 and p c 0 01 is less than 0 5 therefore p c 0 02 is chosen in this paper with the consideration of the accuracy and reliability for the numerical simulation it should be noted that for the present fabrication level the grooves for the practical shs are on the order of micrometers the effect of the surface tension is too weak to stabilize the gas liquid interface as the length of shear free surface increases but considering the computational cost and the vatt performance converges at p c 0 02 in addition the drag reduction and the effective slip length to gf meet the statistical law as shown in fig 6 the actual length of the shs groove is on the order of millimeter in the simulation from fig 6a it can be seen that drag on the airfoil can be decreased with the increase of the gf value the influence of gf on vatt is also studied fig 7b shows the variation of gf values on the power coefficient of vatt as the drag on airfoil can be decreased by the super hydrophobic surface the power coefficient of vatt can be gradually increased with the increase of the gf value gf 0 75 is used for the super hydrophobic surface in the following investigations in this paper and compared with the conventional vatt 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of incoming velocity on vatt with shs with different incoming velocities u fig 8 shows the variation of power coefficient with the tsrs for the conventional and shs vatts it can be seen that the energy efficiency for the conventional vatt and shs vatt all increase with the increase of the inflow velocity the increase of the energy efficiency decreases gradually when the inflow velocity is greater than 1 5 m s the optimal tsr is not affected by the inflow velocity and the application of the shs on the airfoil the optimal tsr for vatts investigated in fig 8 are obtained at 2 64 in order to understand the improvement of the power coefficient acquired by the shs average power coefficient benefit is defined and expressed as 6 δ c p c p s h s c p c o n v e n t i o n the positive value indicates an improvement of the energy efficiency but the negative one means a decrease in the vatt performance it can be seen from fig 8c that the performance has been basically improved under all the inflow velocities and tsrs except that at very low inflow velocity u 0 5 m s and low tsrs the performance improvement under low tsrs is larger than that under high tsrs for the inflow velocity greater than 1 5 m s the maximum improvement of energy coefficient is obtained at u 3 m s and tsr 1 68 which is found to 16 5 it is interesting that the improvement of the power coefficient by shs at high tsrs is almost independence to the inflow velocities fig 9 shows the distribution of the instantaneous power coefficient as a function of azimuthal positions for different inflow velocities at tsr 1 68 for the inflow velocity u 0 5 m s power coefficient can be improved a bit by the shs in the upwind region but decreased in the downwind region with the inflow velocity increases the energy efficiency increment in the upwind region increases gradually and the efficiency curves in the downwind region can also be increased to a certain extent when the incoming velocity u 2 m s 3 2 influence of blade number on vatt with shs blade number can be an important factor which influences the solidity and the power coefficient with the tsrs investigations howell et al 2010 castelli et al 2012 li et al 2015 have been conducted on two three four and five bladed vawt with different airfoil shapes and large effects can be found for the number of blades on the performance of a turbine different blade numbers the same solidity on vatt with the super hydrophobic surface are studied in this section compared with the conventional cases fig 10 shows the aerodynamic performance for vatt with different blade numbers at incoming velocity u 1 m s the overall trend for the power coefficient at every blade number for the conventional and shs vatt is almost the same the variation of the vatt performance with the tsrs and the optimal tsr is little affected by the super hydrophobic surface but the entirety performance of the vatt has been improved to some extent fig 10c shows the power coefficient increment by the super hydrophobic surface at different blade numbers the power coefficient decreases under small tsrs when the blade number is larger than 3 and the relative performance improvement is almost not affected by the blade number under large tsrs when n 3 the improvement of the power coefficient for two bladed vatt is larger than 7 for all tsrs investigated due to the relative low power obtained at large tsrs for the conventional cases the maximum improvement of cp at tsr 3 3 can be reached to 22 5 therefore from the overall performance and the performance improvement obtained by the shs on vatt two bladed and three bladed vatt are still the main consideration for the super hydrophobic vatts fig 11 and fig 12 shows the distribution of the instantaneous power coefficient as a function of azimuthal positions for different blade numbers at tsr 1 68 and 3 09 at tsr 1 68 power coefficient can be improved by the shs on the airfoil in the upwind region but the coefficient is decreased at the downwind region with the increase of blade number the energy absorption improvement by shs decreases gradually and the average power coefficient for the whole vatt is determined by the sum of energy improvement in the upwind region and the decrease in the downwind region so the average power coefficient of shs vatt for n 4 and 5 at tsr 1 68 is a bit lower than the conventional ones at tsr 3 09 the power coefficient can be improved during the whole operating cycle for the blade with the increase of blade number the increasing value for the power coefficient gradually decreases 3 3 influence of solidity on vatt with shs solidity is one of the main parameters which indicate the rotating velocity for the turbine when it reaches the maximum power coefficient despite of the blade number solidity can be also affected by the blade chord and the rotor diameter based on the analysis of blade number on shs vatt three bladed vatt is chosen by varying the chord of airfoils to study the influence of solidity on vatt with shs fig 13 shows the aerodynamic performance for vatt with different solidity at incoming velocity u 1 m s for a given solidity the power coefficients of the vatt with shs are evidently higher than those of the conventional turbine for all tsrs at σ 0 2 the improvement of power coefficient increases with the increase of the tsr as the optimal tsr decreases with the increase of the solidity the maximum improvement of power coefficient by shs is also decreased with the increase of the solidity and with the relative large coefficient at its corresponding optimal tsr the improvement of power coefficient by shs at σ 0 4 0 8 first increases then decreases and then increases with the tsrs the maximum improvement of power coefficient by shs can be reached to 14 2 for the solidity of 0 4 at tsr 2 04 considering the overall performance σ 0 5 and σ 0 6 are recommended for the solidity of the shs vatts fig 14 and fig 15 shows the distribution of the instantaneous power coefficient as a function of azimuthal positions for different solidities at tsr 1 68 and 3 09 at tsr 1 68 for the small solidity σ 0 2 vatt the power coefficient for one blade is relatively smaller than larger solidity for the smaller chord length the absolute length of the shs is also smaller so the improvement of vatt performance is smaller than that at σ 0 5 and 0 8 at the same tsr with the increase of the tsr the relative inflow velocity on blades increase and the effect of the shs on vatt performance increases at σ 0 2 for σ 0 8 as the large absolute length of the shs the power coefficient can be improved during the whole operating cycle for the blade at both tsr 1 68 and tsr 3 09 in order to know the effect of shs on the flow filed of the vatt fig 16 and fig 17 show the vortex structure around the airfoils at 0 and 90 azimuthal positions for u 1 m s n 3 and σ 0 5 vatt although the shs cannot completely eliminate the large separation vortex on airfoils the size of the separated vortex on blade 2 and the trailing vortex in fig 16 has been restrained the strength of the leading edge vortex is increased to a certain extent the trailing vortex and the size of the leading edge separation vortex on blade 3 have also been restrained when blade 1 spins to position of 90 the size of the vortex around the inner side of blade 1 decreases but the flow on blade 2 hardly varies and the size of vortex on blade 3 increases which leads to the decrease of the power coefficient referred to fig 14b 4 conclusion a vertical axis tidal turbine with shs on the airfoils is proposed and investigated by numerical simulation in this paper the influence of inflow velocity number of blades and solidity on vatt with shs was studied shs on the blade can increase the power coefficient of vatt effectively and improve the flow field around the turbine airfoils following concludes can be drawn according to the analysis 1 at low tip speed ratio the energy efficiency increases with the increase of the inflow velocity for the vatt with shs on the airfoil while at high tip speed ratio the power increment is almost independent to the inflow velocity the maximum power coefficient improvement can reach to 16 5 when the inflow velocity is 3 m s at tsr 1 68 2 keep the solidity as a constant the shs on the airfoil can improve the energy efficiency for the two bladed vatt in the tsr range from 1 44 to 3 3 and the power coefficient increment is more than 7 the energy efficiency improvement decreases gradually with the increase of blade number for vatt with shs in the case of small tsrs and the power increment is also almost independent to the blades number at high tsrs 3 the increment of the energy efficiency increases with the tsrs at σ 0 2 for σ 0 4 0 8 the improvement of the power efficiency first increases then decreases and then increases generally the smallest increment of the power efficiency occurs at the optimal tsr 4 the vortex structure around the airfoil can also be affected by the shs on the airfoil the size of the separated vortex and trailing vortex can be restrained in the upwind region but the vortex is enlarged at the azimuthal positions from 270 to 360 corresponding to the lower power coefficient the present study focused on the validation of performance improvement by the shs and slip effect on the tidal turbine and only 2d simulation is conducted considering the practical size for the micro scale of the super hydrophobic surface is on the order of micrometer it is difficult to obtain for the rans simulation on the external flow so tidal turbine model experiment with super hydrophobic surface in the water tunnel will be conducted in the future work to verify the actual effect of the

suitable bionic super hydrophobic surface shs has high drag reduction effect because of the slip effect on the solid surface this paper conducted numerical simulation to study the aerodynamic performance improvement of vertical axis tidal turbine vatt with shs on the airfoils the influence of different inflow velocities blade number and solidities of vatt with shs are studied the results show that the maximum energy efficiency can be increased by 16 5 at the inflow velocity u 3 m s the improvement of power coefficient is found greatly influenced by the inflow velocity blade number and solidity at small tip speed ratios while the increment of the energy efficiency is almost independent to these aerodynamic parameters at high tip speed ratios keywords vertical axis tidal turbine

transition sst standard k ε and rng k ε model fail to capture the optimal tsr of the vawt the overestimation of the 2d simulation results obtained by sst k ω model with the experiment is mainly due to the limits of a 2d model which ignores the 3d effects such as tip vortex and pressure distribution along the 3d blade and it is reasonable that the values of power coefficient cp obtained with the 2d computer simulation are higher than the values measured in the experiment so the cp curve obtained by standard k ε model at high tsrs is even lower than the 3d experiment data which is unreasonable for the 2d simulation considering sst k w model is formed by combining k ω and k ε models which allows the sst k w model shows very good capability for simulating flow with great adverse pressure gradients and separating flow menter et al 2003 and the overall trend of tsr curve and the value of optimal tsr of vawt captured are consistent with the experimental results the two equation sst k ω model is chosen as the turbulence model for the simulation 2 3 verification of the super hydrophobic surface model as the super hydrophobic surface is given as the alternate surface with non slip wall and shear free surface verification of the super hydrophobic surface model on naca0021 airfoil at re c 300 000 with p c 0 02 at angle of attack α 0 is conducted with the literature data obtained in laminar and turbulent channel flows maynes et al 2007 park et al 2013 as can be seen from fig 6 a similar functional relationship can be found for the super hydrophobic surface on naca0021 airfoil and the channel flows the drag reduction normalized to the drag on the conventional airfoil surface and the effective slip length all increase with the gf value the magnitude difference from the literature is mainly due to the reynolds number and the flow condition such as in the internal flow and in the external flow so the alternate surface with non slip wall and shear free surface can be an effective way to define the super hydrophobic surface once the gf value is given different combinations of p and w as well as the number of the pitches can be existed for the super hydrophobic surface in order to determine and consider the influence of the pitch value p p c 0 01 0 02 0 04 and 0 2 are studied on vatt with gf 0 5 fig 7 a shows the computing average power coefficient of vatt with different super hydrophobic surface pitch value on airfoils with p c decreases the power coefficient at all tsrs converges the difference of the power coefficient between p c 0 02 and p c 0 01 is less than 0 5 therefore p c 0 02 is chosen in this paper with the consideration of the accuracy and reliability for the numerical simulation it should be noted that for the present fabrication level the grooves for the practical shs are on the order of micrometers the effect of the surface tension is too weak to stabilize the gas liquid interface as the length of shear free surface increases but considering the computational cost and the vatt performance converges at p c 0 02 in addition the drag reduction and the effective slip length to gf meet the statistical law as shown in fig 6 the actual length of the shs groove is on the order of millimeter in the simulation from fig 6a it can be seen that drag on the airfoil can be decreased with the increase of the gf value the influence of gf on vatt is also studied fig 7b shows the variation of gf values on the power coefficient of vatt as the drag on airfoil can be decreased by the super hydrophobic surface the power coefficient of vatt can be gradually increased with the increase of the gf value gf 0 75 is used for the super hydrophobic surface in the following investigations in this paper and compared with the conventional vatt 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of incoming velocity on vatt with shs with different incoming velocities u fig 8 shows the variation of power coefficient with the tsrs for the conventional and shs vatts it can be seen that the energy efficiency for the conventional vatt and shs vatt all increase with the increase of the inflow velocity the increase of the energy efficiency decreases gradually when the inflow velocity is greater than 1 5 m s the optimal tsr is not affected by the inflow velocity and the application of the shs on the airfoil the optimal tsr for vatts investigated in fig 8 are obtained at 2 64 in order to understand the improvement of the power coefficient acquired by the shs average power coefficient benefit is defined and expressed as 6 δ c p c p s h s c p c o n v e n t i o n the positive value indicates an improvement of the energy efficiency but the negative one means a decrease in the vatt performance it can be seen from fig 8c that the performance has been basically improved under all the inflow velocities and tsrs except that at very low inflow velocity u 0 5 m s and low tsrs the performance improvement under low tsrs is larger than that under high tsrs for the inflow velocity greater than 1 5 m s the maximum improvement of energy coefficient is obtained at u 3 m s and tsr 1 68 which is found to 16 5 it is interesting that the improvement of the power coefficient by shs at high tsrs is almost independence to the inflow velocities fig 9 shows the distribution of the instantaneous power coefficient as a function of azimuthal positions for different inflow velocities at tsr 1 68 for the inflow velocity u 0 5 m s power coefficient can be improved a bit by the shs in the upwind region but decreased in the downwind region with the inflow velocity increases the energy efficiency increment in the upwind region increases gradually and the efficiency curves in the downwind region can also be increased to a certain extent when the incoming velocity u 2 m s 3 2 influence of blade number on vatt with shs blade number can be an important factor which influences the solidity and the power coefficient with the tsrs investigations howell et al 2010 castelli et al 2012 li et al 2015 have been conducted on two three four and five bladed vawt with different airfoil shapes and large effects can be found for the number of blades on the performance of a turbine different blade numbers the same solidity on vatt with the super hydrophobic surface are studied in this section compared with the conventional cases fig 10 shows the aerodynamic performance for vatt with different blade numbers at incoming velocity u 1 m s the overall trend for the power coefficient at every blade number for the conventional and shs vatt is almost the same the variation of the vatt performance with the tsrs and the optimal tsr is little affected by the super hydrophobic surface but the entirety performance of the vatt has been improved to some extent fig 10c shows the power coefficient increment by the super hydrophobic surface at different blade numbers the power coefficient decreases under small tsrs when the blade number is larger than 3 and the relative performance improvement is almost not affected by the blade number under large tsrs when n 3 the improvement of the power coefficient for two bladed vatt is larger than 7 for all tsrs investigated due to the relative low power obtained at large tsrs for the conventional cases the maximum improvement of cp at tsr 3 3 can be reached to 22 5 therefore from the overall performance and the performance improvement obtained by the shs on vatt two bladed and three bladed vatt are still the main consideration for the super hydrophobic vatts fig 11 and fig 12 shows the distribution of the instantaneous power coefficient as a function of azimuthal positions for different blade numbers at tsr 1 68 and 3 09 at tsr 1 68 power coefficient can be improved by the shs on the airfoil in the upwind region but the coefficient is decreased at the downwind region with the increase of blade number the energy absorption improvement by shs decreases gradually and the average power coefficient for the whole vatt is determined by the sum of energy improvement in the upwind region and the decrease in the downwind region so the average power coefficient of shs vatt for n 4 and 5 at tsr 1 68 is a bit lower than the conventional ones at tsr 3 09 the power coefficient can be improved during the whole operating cycle for the blade with the increase of blade number the increasing value for the power coefficient gradually decreases 3 3 influence of solidity on vatt with shs solidity is one of the main parameters which indicate the rotating velocity for the turbine when it reaches the maximum power coefficient despite of the blade number solidity can be also affected by the blade chord and the rotor diameter based on the analysis of blade number on shs vatt three bladed vatt is chosen by varying the chord of airfoils to study the influence of solidity on vatt with shs fig 13 shows the aerodynamic performance for vatt with different solidity at incoming velocity u 1 m s for a given solidity the power coefficients of the vatt with shs are evidently higher than those of the conventional turbine for all tsrs at σ 0 2 the improvement of power coefficient increases with the increase of the tsr as the optimal tsr decreases with the increase of the solidity the maximum improvement of power coefficient by shs is also decreased with the increase of the solidity and with the relative large coefficient at its corresponding optimal tsr the improvement of power coefficient by shs at σ 0 4 0 8 first increases then decreases and then increases with the tsrs the maximum improvement of power coefficient by shs can be reached to 14 2 for the solidity of 0 4 at tsr 2 04 considering the overall performance σ 0 5 and σ 0 6 are recommended for the solidity of the shs vatts fig 14 and fig 15 shows the distribution of the instantaneous power coefficient as a function of azimuthal positions for different solidities at tsr 1 68 and 3 09 at tsr 1 68 for the small solidity σ 0 2 vatt the power coefficient for one blade is relatively smaller than larger solidity for the smaller chord length the absolute length of the shs is also smaller so the improvement of vatt performance is smaller than that at σ 0 5 and 0 8 at the same tsr with the increase of the tsr the relative inflow velocity on blades increase and the effect of the shs on vatt performance increases at σ 0 2 for σ 0 8 as the large absolute length of the shs the power coefficient can be improved during the whole operating cycle for the blade at both tsr 1 68 and tsr 3 09 in order to know the effect of shs on the flow filed of the vatt fig 16 and fig 17 show the vortex structure around the airfoils at 0 and 90 azimuthal positions for u 1 m s n 3 and σ 0 5 vatt although the shs cannot completely eliminate the large separation vortex on airfoils the size of the separated vortex on blade 2 and the trailing vortex in fig 16 has been restrained the strength of the leading edge vortex is increased to a certain extent the trailing vortex and the size of the leading edge separation vortex on blade 3 have also been restrained when blade 1 spins to position of 90 the size of the vortex around the inner side of blade 1 decreases but the flow on blade 2 hardly varies and the size of vortex on blade 3 increases which leads to the decrease of the power coefficient referred to fig 14b 4 conclusion a vertical axis tidal turbine with shs on the airfoils is proposed and investigated by numerical simulation in this paper the influence of inflow velocity number of blades and solidity on vatt with shs was studied shs on the blade can increase the power coefficient of vatt effectively and improve the flow field around the turbine airfoils following concludes can be drawn according to the analysis 1 at low tip speed ratio the energy efficiency increases with the increase of the inflow velocity for the vatt with shs on the airfoil while at high tip speed ratio the power increment is almost independent to the inflow velocity the maximum power coefficient improvement can reach to 16 5 when the inflow velocity is 3 m s at tsr 1 68 2 keep the solidity as a constant the shs on the airfoil can improve the energy efficiency for the two bladed vatt in the tsr range from 1 44 to 3 3 and the power coefficient increment is more than 7 the energy efficiency improvement decreases gradually with the increase of blade number for vatt with shs in the case of small tsrs and the power increment is also almost independent to the blades number at high tsrs 3 the increment of the energy efficiency increases with the tsrs at σ 0 2 for σ 0 4 0 8 the improvement of the power efficiency first increases then decreases and then increases generally the smallest increment of the power efficiency occurs at the optimal tsr 4 the vortex structure around the airfoil can also be affected by the shs on the airfoil the size of the separated vortex and trailing vortex can be restrained in the upwind region but the vortex is enlarged at the azimuthal positions from 270 to 360 corresponding to the lower power coefficient the present study focused on the validation of performance improvement by the shs and slip effect on the tidal turbine and only 2d simulation is conducted considering the practical size for the micro scale of the super hydrophobic surface is on the order of micrometer it is difficult to obtain for the rans simulation on the external flow so tidal turbine model experiment with super hydrophobic surface in the water tunnel will be conducted in the future work to verify the actual effect of the shs on the power absorption improvement for vatt credit authorship contribution statement jinjing sun conceptualization validation formal analysis investigation data curation writing original draft

fluid compressibility and three dimensionality on the acceleration velocity vertical motion and pressures on the entry body are studied the peak values of pressures on the bottom and top surfaces of the wedge during slamming and air cavity closure stage are analyzed together with the occurrence time of them keywords openfoam 3d water impact slamming pressure compressibility air cavity 1 introduction the research of water entry problems has many applications in various topics such as the slamming of high speed ships the landing of the space vehicle on the sea surface and the design of military projectiles entering water at high speed research work on this subject has been mainly focused on the assessment of impact loads on the body at the initial stage of water entry prediction of the water entry trajectory and understanding of the evolution of the air cavity behind the falling body after the initial impact as an important application in naval architecture the study of large hydrodynamic loads on surface ships and offshore structures subjected to water entry because of the large amplitude relative motions has been extensively performed the important pioneering study on this subject can be attributed to von kármàn 1929 and wagner 1932 who developed the theoretical models on the idealized problem of a two dimensional wedge impacting onto a calm water surface wagner s asymptotic solution has been applied and further developed by some researchers such as dobrovol skaya 1969 logvinovich 1973 howison et al 1991 and zhao et al 1996 recently the numerical tools have been widely used in slamming problems water entry of 2d wedge sections were simulated in maki et al 2011 wang and guedes soares 2013 southall et al 2014 ma et al 2016 and monroy et al 2016 while the ship section cases were investigated by ghadimi et al 2013 and wang and guedes soares 2014a a comparative study of a water entry problem was conducted in hong et al 2017 who compared the numerical results from different solutions e g openfoam star ccm sph cip and in house code with model test data these studies have been focused on the analysis of two dimensional structures since slamming on ships has been a major concern and the 2d strip theory has been widely used for predicting the relative motions of ships relative to waves such as the study of hermundstad and moan 2005 for bow flare slamming on a ro ro vessel and wang and guedes soares 2016a 2016b for the bow and stern slamming problems of a chemical tanker nevertheless the use of a strip theory assumes the ship hull to be slender which is not always true donguy et al 2001 mentioned that some problems arose when the strip theory was applied to study the local hydro elastic effects associated with several slamming events which exist significant three dimensional effects unlike the two dimensional problems fewer analytical solutions scolan and korobkin 2001 korobkin and scolan 2006 have been developed for the study on slamming of three dimensional bodies which mostly relies on experimental tests i e de backer et al 2009 mutsudab et al 2018 wang et al 2020 and numerical methods i e wang and guedes soares 2014b camilleri et al 2015 maruzewski et al 2010 facci et al 2016 xiang et al 2020 for example the experimental study on the water impact of 3d buoys in de backer et al 2009 was used in wang and guedes soares 2014b for validating the numerical ale results and in nguyen et al 2016 for evaluating the results from a navier stokes ns method with moving chimera grid two software packages openfoam and star ccm were utilized to predict the slamming loads on 2d ship sections and a 3d scaled model of a container ship advancing in incident waves by shen et al 2016 using the overset grid technique it was shown that both software over predicted the slamming loads on 2d cases and underestimate the green water impact force on 3d scaled ship model though their predictions of bow and bottom slamming forces agreed well with experiments water entry of ship models were investigated experimentally by some researchers such as mutsudab et al 2018 for a 3d stern model and wang et al 2020 for a 3d bow model for identifying the characteristics of the key parameters of bow and stern slamming pressures both the numerical work of camilleri et al 2015 and wang et al 2019a revealed that three dimensional effects had a significant influence on the pressure peaks particularly during the early stages of water entry most of the theoretical and numerical work on the slamming problems assumed an incompressible fluid flow because for ship slamming problems the entry velocity is rather small compared to the speed of sound in water and compressibility can generally be neglected wang and guedes soares 2017 however in cases where the deadrise angle is nearly zero the spray root and jet move at a speed much higher than the entry velocity and compressibility effects can be significant korobkin 1992 carcaterra and ciappi 2000 2004 honghui and takami 2001 the study of kleefsman et al 2005 and yang and qiu 2012 demonstrated the importance of including the air phase in the numerical simulation for the water entry problems the importance of the compressibility of the air has been studied e g yang and qiu 2012 southall et al 2014 elhimer et al 2017 indicating that the introduction of air compressibility seems to cause a slightly larger peak pressure with lagging of the instant when the peak pressure occurred bihnam et al 2017 concluded that the free surface profiles during the water impact were significantly influenced by the compressibility of the fluids as mentioned before the trajectory of the body and the air cavity formation in the later stage also interest the researchers who are working with the water entry problems for example vincent et al 2018 investigate the motion impact force splash and cavity evolution of a rigid wedge entering water as a function of the wedge opening angle showing that while the entry velocity does not have any noticeable effect on the shape of the cavity as noted previously in duclaux et al 2007 it does have a significant effect on the splash shape the air cavity effects on the water impact problems have been discussed for example in lee et al 1997 chu et al 2004 holland et al 2004 yan et al 2009 song b 2015 wang et al 2015a 2015b iranmanesh and passandideh fard 2017 and shi et al 2019 it has been confirmed that the formation of air cavity significantly influences the dynamics and trajectory of low speed projectiles e g chu et al 2004 holland et al 2004 water entry of a horizontal circular cylinder with low froude numbers was investigated numerically by iranmanesh and passandideh fard 2017 using the volume of fluid technique the results were validated against the experiments available in the literature and the formation of cavity was discussed considering the water entry of a projectile the results in chen et al 2019 showed that the compressibility effects play a significant role in the development of cavitation and the pressure inside the cavity wang et al 2015a developed theoretical models to analyze the loads motions and cavity dynamics for freefall wedges with different deadrise angles vertically entering the water surface showing that for froude number larger than the critical froude number the entry velocity decreases after the slamming stage as noticed in the experimental study of wang et al 2015b which showed also that the air compressibility matter the results in the stage of the closure of the cavity wang et al 2019a numerically investigate the water entry of the 2d and 3d wedge indicating that the 3d effects affect the slamming force peaks it was also observed that the hydrodynamic force profile in the post closure from the incompressible solver was different from the one obtained in the experiments of wang et al 2015b the vof based multiple phase solver adopting the deformation mesh method available in the openfoam is applied in this study for assessing the effects of the fluid compressibility on the vertical motion velocity hydrodynamic force and pressures on a rigid wedge entering into water by considering two initial entry velocities the formation of the air cavity on the top of the body and its effects on the body are discussed both 2d and 3d models are simulated using the incompressible and compressible fluid solvers by comparing the results from these models the effects of the fluid compressibility are analyzed together with the effects of the three dimensionality 2 numerical method the openfoam open source field operation and manipulation version applied in this study is 2 4 0 which is maintained by the openfoam foundation the navier stokes equations for a compressible flow of a newtonian fluid in vector form are 1 ρ u t ρ u u p 2 3 μ u μ u u μ ρ g σ κ α 1 α 1 where ρ is the density of the fluid u is the fluid velocity p is the pressure g is the acceleration of gravity μ is the dynamic viscosity σ is the surface tension coefficient к is curvature of the free surface α 1 is phase fraction of phase 1 and t represents the time the continuity equation is 2 ρ t ρ u 0 here the curvature of the free surface is calculated from the phase fraction as follows 3 κ α 1 α 1 the equation of state in the compressible vof method is given as 4 ρ i ρ 0 i ψ i p where ψ i is the compressibility factor ψ i 1 c i 2 and c i is the speed of sound and i means the phase for the compressible gas phase the nominal density ρ 0 is defined as zero which leads to an ideal gas equation for an isothermal fluid where ψ 1 r t with the gas constant r and the temperature t for the low compressibility water phase ρ 0 is equal to the nominal density of the liquid under normal conditions in general the density of water can be considered as constant unless the mach number is higher than 0 3 the volume of fluid vof method is used to track the free surface elevation this method determines the fraction of the fluid that exists in each cell the equation for the volume fraction is 5 α i t α i u i 1 α i α i u r 0 where α i is the volume fraction of phase in the cell and varies from 0 to 1 and 1 α i α i u r is an anti diffusion term utilized to sharpen the interface in vof method both fluids are treated as a single fluid mixture whose properties change in space based on the volume fraction of each phase 6 ρ α 1 ρ 1 α 2 ρ 2 7 μ α 1 μ 1 α 2 μ 2 8 α 1 α 2 1 the segregated solution algorithm used in the case of a compressible solver is the pimple scheme the continuity equation 2 and the equation of state 4 are rearranged to obtain an equation for pressure p the momentum conservation equation 1 is selected to solve for velocity filed u for mesh generation blockmesh and snappyhexmesh tools are applied to resolve the motion of the mesh mesh morphing around the geometry openfoam s dynamicmotionsolverfvmesh solver is utilized the sixdofrigidbodymotion function is used to capture the free movement of the wedges to capture the moving interface boundaries as well as model mesh motions and topology changes the interdymfoam and compressibleinterdymfoam solvers are applied for solving navier stokes equations respectively for incompressible and compressible fluid cases 3 computational model the tested wedge model in wang et al 2015b is utilized in the present study to investigate the evolution of slamming pressure the hydrodynamic loads wedge motions and evolution of the air cavity during the free falling process fig 1 shows the wedge cylinder arrangement and the locations of the pressure sensors in the test where the sensors p4 p5 are located on the bottom and p1 p3 are mounted on the top of the body the total mass of the wedge cylinder is 32 3 kg m and the initial entry speed is v0 0 92 m s and 2 50 m s the maximum froude number f n v 0 g c 0 with v0the initial entry speed g the acceleration of gravity and c0 the half width of the wedge is 1 02 and 2 77 respectively for the two cases both the 2d and 3d computations are performed fig 2 presents the numerical setup of the free falling water impact problems of 3d bodies the chosen cartesian coordinates are x direction is parallel to l1 y direction parallel to l2 and z direction parallel to the flume width l3 the x origin is located in the symmetric line of the body and y origin is located in the initial free surface elevation to build up the computational mesh the fluid domain is firstly created by using blockmesh with the dimension l1 l2 l3 the stl file describing the geometry of the rigid body is integrated into the flow domain by using snappyhexmesh and is defined as a moving wall for a freely falling body the sixdofrigidbodymotion scheme is applied to describe the motion of the body in deformation mesh method there is a limit for the motion of the body because large motion would induce distortion on the cells to eliminate the instabilities of the large motion the rigid body is located just above the water surface and released with an initial entry velocity the left right front and back boundaries of the computational domain are defined as walls together with the bottom side in the 2d numerical modelling the cell number in z direction is set to 1 and front and back patches are defined as empty in the experiments of wang et al 2015 the depth of the water is between 1 m and 1 2 m and the width of the tank is 0 4 m to enable the simulations with a higher movement on the dynamic mesh domain the dimensions of the fluid domain in openfoam is 2 4 m 0 8 air 1 2water 2 m parametric study of mesh size and the maximum courant number for openfoam simulations of water entry problems have been performed for 2d bodies in wang et al 2019b and for 3d bodies in wang et al 2019a which include the wedge cylinder here a computational model that enables the simulations with a relatively large motion and also provide satisfactory results is chosen because the same mesh resolutions and maximum courant number are utilized in all the simulations it is considered that numerical uncertainties would have little influence on the analysis of compressibility and three dimensionality the mesh resolutions are shown in fig 3 where the uniform cells are utilized in the middle and expanding ones are applied in other domains the maximum courant number is defined as 0 25 in the mesh generation the wedge body is created by cutting the meshes in the computational domain with a stl file containing the body geometry it contributes to the discrepancies of the model with the actual geometry on the edges shown in fig 3 b since the mesh size is very small relative to the dimensions of the body the effects of the uneven edges are neglected the total number of the cells is 47772 for 2d models and 7192932 for 3d models the simulation duration is 0 4 s and 0 5 s for the two cases respectively all the 3d simulations are performed on a regular desktop equipped with an intel core i7 4570 3 2 ghz 12 with 64 gb of ram memory 4 results and discussions the water entry process of the free falling wedge was divided into four stages slamming transition collapse and post closure stages by wang et al 2015b these four stages in water entry process of the wedge cylinder are simulated using openfoam considering fluid compressibility and 3d effects for the case with an initial velocity of 0 92 m s the numerical results of acceleration velocity motion and hydrodynamic pressures are compared with the experimental data from wang et al 2015b while the results from different models are compared for the case with v0 2 5 m s 4 1 comparisons of the motions fig 4 presents the numerical results of the vertical acceleration on the wedge during the water entry process during the slamming stage the acceleration increases gradually after the body touches the water surface due to the high change rate of the added mass and drops greatly when the flow separates from the body for the case with v0 0 92 m s it is clearly seen that the compressibility causes a slightly higher amplitude and a time lag on the peak values of the acceleration while the three dimensionality of the model leads to about 24 decrease on the peak values compared with the experimental peak value 1 58 m s2 the prediction of 3d compressible model is 1 85 m s2 which is about 17 higher while the value from 3d incompressible model is 19 lower for the case with v0 2 5 m s the similar three dimensional effect is found but the fluid compressibility does not matter the peak value much on the 3d cases after the flow separates from the fully submerged body the change rate of the added mass reduces greatly thus the acceleration drops comparing the results shown in fig 4 a with those in fig 4 b it is found that the acceleration increases gradually for the case with v0 0 92 m s while it does not change much during a long period of time for the case with v0 2 5 m s for the former case a low entry velocity leads to lower vertical acceleration resulting in smaller hydrodynamic force where the gravity of the body matters for the latter although the acceleration drops greatly the hydrodynamic force still dominates in the total force the numerical result from the 3d model with the compressible fluid agree better with the experimental data at this initial stage compared to the measured peak value the 3d compressible model provides a 17 higher result and 3d incompressible model has a 20 lower prediction the occurrence time of the peak value from experiments are very close to the ones in 3d simulations indicating that the water jet below the bottom of the body separates from the surface at almost the same time at the late stage of the process an air cavity is formed on the top of the wedge as the penetration depth of the body into water increases the gap above the air cavity becomes smaller resulting in the increase of the pressure in the cavity near the pinch off closure of the air cavity the gap becomes very narrow and the air flows out of the cavity with a very high velocity as seen in fig 4 a significant value of acceleration occurs downwards due to the high pressure in the air cavity near the pinch off after these peaks oscillations are observed in the 2d compressible computations this is consistent with the results observed in wang et al 2015b who mentioned that after the closure of the cavity the air compressibility matters inducing an oscillation of the cavity pressure and of the wedge acceleration however similar oscillations are not found in the 3d compressible computations in 3d simulations an air leakage could be formed during the oscillation of the cavity which causes a significant decay of the cavity pressure and leads to air flow in the longitudinal direction abrahamsen and faltinsen 2011 have mentioned that the damping due to heat transfer plays an important role on the decay of the oscillations and the entrapment of air pockets on walls by breaking waves would be one of the reasons as mentioned before the width of the tank in experiments is 0 4 m but the numerical tank is defined as 2 4 m in width to enable the large vertical motion of the body due to the differences the air leakage heat transfer and air flow in longitudinal direction in 3d simulations might be different from the experiments and 2d models in addition the longitudinal dimension of the numerical tank is only 2 m the damping due to the entrapment of air pockets on walls in longitudinal direction is likely one reason as well for both the two cases the occurrence of the increment on acceleration is the earliest in the 3d incompressible model the second in the 3d compressible model third in the 2d incompressible model and the last in the 2d compressible model this might be related with the pinch off time of the air cavity which will be discussed later with the plots of the evolution of the air cavity and the quantitative comparisons of the peak values and their occurrence time fig 5 and fig 6 compare the numerical results of the vertical motion and velocity of the wedge respectively considering that the slamming stage starts when the body touches the water surface and stops when the acceleration reaches a peak value it can be concluded that the fluid compressibility and three dimensionality do not affect the vertical motion of the body in the slamming stage in the later stage the three dimensional effects of the model cause some differences on the motion while the effects of fluid compressibility are little as to the vertical velocity of the wedge during the water entry process it is found that the evolution is completely different regarding the two cases for the case with v0 0 92 m s the entry velocity increases at the slamming stage decreases a little at the transition stage and it changes a lot during the formation of the air cavity for the case with v0 2 5 m s it increases a little bit when the body touches the water surface then decreases gradually until the closure of the air cavity which causes slight increase of the velocity similar to the motion of the body the effects of fluid compressibility and three dimensionality are negligible at the slamming stage however the three dimensionality do matter the results in the later stage and the influence of fluid compressibility is more apparent for the case with lower initial entry speed 4 2 comparisons of the hydrodynamic pressures fig 7 shows the numerical results of the pressure values p1 p6 from different models of the wedge with v0 0 92 m s together with the experimental measures from wang et al 2015b as shown in fig 1 the pressure sensors of p1 p3 are located near the edge of the 3d wedge in the longitudinal direction in the present 2d simulations all the probes are mounted in the middle of the elements for the 3d simulations the probes are located in the same points as shown in fig 1 a in addition to the probes p1 p6 the 3d simulations include six extra probes where pm means the sensors p1 p3 in the middle of the wedge in z axis and pil i 4 5 6 denote the sensors p4 p5 located in the same z coordinates of p1 p3 the comparisons of the pressures in the middle section with the ones near the edge enable the investigation of the three dimensional effects in the longitudinal direction as shown in fig 7 the initial peaks in p1 p3 occur when the acceleration drops greatly and the results from different models are consistent with the predicted accelerations for the pressures on the bottom of the wedge the initial pressure peaks occur at the slamming stage and they are lower compared to the peak values which happen during the closure of the air cavity at the slamming stage the pressure peaks from all the models occur almost at the same time moment however due to the effects of fluid compressibility and three dimensionality the peaks in the later stage occur at different moments at the slamming stage the pressure evolutions predicted from all the models are in good agreement with the experimental measurement except that the initial impulses are observed in the experiments at the later stage the amplitude of the pressure peaks from the 3d compressible models agrees better with the measurements regardless of the oscillations while only the compressible 2d model captures the oscillations of the pressure considering the first peak in the pressure at the later stage the values predicted from 2d model are higher than the 3d computations whilst the results from the compressible models are lower compared to the ones obtained from the incompressible solver which is contrary to the comparison of the slamming pressure peaks at the initial stage it can be seen also that when the 3d computation is performed the effects of the fluid compressibility are negligible comparing the pressures in the middle with the ones near the edge on the top of the 3d wedge i e pm with p1 p2 p3 it is seen that the first peaks from the former are slightly higher and the second peaks of the pressure occur in the middle on the top surface the second peaks predicted from the 3d compressible models have a time lag with the ones from the incompressible models these second peaks of the pressure could be explained by the water drops onto the top surface of the wedge after the closure of the air cavity the pressure peaks on the middle of the bottom are slightly higher than the ones near the edge both at the slamming and at the post closure stage fig 8 shows the numerical results of the pressure values p1 p6 from different models of the wedge with v0 2 5 m s for the pressures on the bottom of the wedge the peak values at the slamming stage are bigger than the ones predicted at the late stage the compressible models capture the oscillations in the pressure curves however the effects of the fluid compressibility on the peaks are negligible for the 2d models considering the first peaks in the late stage it is found that the results from the 2d models are higher than the ones from 3d models while the 3d compressible models provide lower results compared with the 3d incompressible solver the same results can be found for the pressures on the top surface of the wedge as seen in fig 7 initial impulses occur in the experiments for p4 and p5 but they are not captured in the simulations with v0 0 92 m s fig 8 shows better agreement on the initial peaks for the case with v0 2 5 m s it has been proposed by guedes soares 1989 that the slamming force is given by the sum of two components the first one is an impact component related to the impact of bottom on the water surface and characterized by a large peak with small duration the second one is given by the rate of change of the hydrodynamic momentum as the hull enters the water the theorem of impulse assumes that the maximum impact pressure is proportional to the quadratic impact velocity as 0 5ρkv t 2 where ρ is density of water k is a coefficient depending on the sectional geometry and v t is the simultaneous entry velocity for the case with v0 0 92 m s the initial impulse and the momentum components are both observed in the measured pressure curves while for the case with v0 2 5 m s it seems that the initial component dominates the pressures due to the high initial velocity in the author s previous numerical study on assessment of slamming pressures it was found difficult to capture the initial impulses for the case with a low entry velocity unless the simulation has very fine meshes and a very small time step which results in extremely high cpu there are also large numerical uncertainties on the predictions of the impulses in addition it has been justified that the initial impulses have little effect on the total slamming force motions and responses on a different context the occurrence of slamming on the bow flare of an fpso was studied in a detailed experimental study of the impact of waves in a plate at various inclination angles guedes soares et al 2007 it was observed that for the same conditions of passing waves the slamming identified as a large initial peak would only occur for certain values of the local wave steepness which explains why in some conditions the peak impulse can be detected and not in others 4 3 comparisons of the free surface elevation fig 9 compares the free surface elevation profiles predicted from the 2d simulations of the case with v0 0 92 m s as the air compressibility has limited effects on the slamming stage for the low froude cases the profiles after this stage are presented here at t 0 09s the water jet has separates from the body as seen for the 2d incompressible mode the water splash out like a continuous water jet when it comes to the 2d compressible model a lot of water droplets appear in the spray at t 0 18s the air cavity is larger due to the increased penetration of the body into the water in this collapse stage the acceleration increases gradually at t 0 32s the air cavity is closed for the incompressible model while a small gap still exists in the compressible case comparing with the time history of the pressures it can be concluded that the first peak values occur when the cavity is closed at t 0 44s a few water particles drop on the top of the wedge the shape of the cavity and free surface are almost the same for the two models fig 10 presents the evolutions of the free surface elevation for the 3d models with v0 0 92 m s including the profiles in x y and y z planes the selected time moments are as same as the ones in the 2d cases for the first two time moments the free surface elevations are similar to the ones in 2d cases and the air compressibility does not affect the results a lot at t 0 32s it is seen that the air cavity is closed and some water droplets are falling onto the top of the object in the x y plane while in y z plane the elevated water touches with the top of the edges of the wedge it can be found that the closure of the air cavity occurs earlier in the incompressible models comparisons between the 3d plots and the 2d ones show that the closure of the air cavity occurs earlier in 3d models fig 11 and fig 12 compare the free surface elevation profiles predicted from the numerical simulations of the case with v0 2 5 m s respectively for 2d and 3d models the differences of the generated wave elevation profiles from the incompressible and compressible models are observed on the water jet considering the profiles in x y plane or the ones from 2d models at t 0 197s it is found that the shape of the water jet from the compressible models are quite different observing the profiles in t 0 297s it is found that cavity closure occurs the earliest in the 3d incompressible model and it happens the latest in the 2d compressible model it is consistent with the comparisons of the occurrence time of the significant increment of acceleration and pressures in the late stage 4 4 non dimensional coefficients the time history of the motions velocity acceleration and pressures are presented above for the two cases combing with evolutions of the free surface elevation it is concluded that the slamming pressure peaks occur at the early stage and the second peak happens when the air cavity is closed for the two cases the time moments of the occurrence of these peaks are different in order to understand the water entry process in non dimensional time moments the non dimensional results will be presented here fig 13 compares the non dimensional acceleration for the two cases where the non dimensional time are given as dp h where dp is the penetration depth of the object into water and h is the vertical dimension of the object and the non dimensional acceleration is calculated using acc g where acc means the computed acceleration and g is the gravitational acceleration it seems that the peak values occur at the similar non dimensional time for each case in order to understand the differences between the peak values and the occurrence time from different models the results are listed in table 1 where a1 means the values of the maximum acceleration during the slamming stage a2 means the ones for the minimum values during the closure of the cavity and τ1 τ2 represent the time when a1 and a2 occur at the slamming stage the 3d effects are significant on the peak values for the two cases the compressibility causes 22 49 and 32 67 higher peaks value in the case with v0 0 92 m s for 2d and 3d models respectively in the case with v0 2 5 m s the effects are limited it is found that the occurrence time of the peaks at slamming stage is almost the same for the same model with two different entry velocities it can be concluded that the maximum slamming force occurs around dp h 0 67 after the body touches the water surface for the incompressible simulations while it occurs around dp h 0 74 for the compressible ones when it comes to the late stage the effects of the compressibility are significant the fluid compressibility delays the closure of the air cavity and affects the amplitude of the peak values for the 3d cases the absolute values of a2 from the 3d compressible models are 63 24 and 73 26 lower than the ones from the 3d incompressible simulations for the two cases when the 2d cases are considered it is found that the fluid compressibility has less effects on the values of a2 fig 14 and fig 15 compare the non dimensional pressure coefficients on p1 and p5 which is defined as cp p 0 5ρv2 where p is the computed pressures ρ is the density of water and v is the entry velocity shown in fig 7 the pressure sensor p1 is located on the top of the wedge and it is seen that the first peak values occur at the same time as the a2 happens comparing the slamming peak value with the first peak in the late stage for pressure p5 it is found that the non dimensional pressure occurs in the cavity post closure stage is much higher for both the two cases for the case with v0 2 5 m s fig 8 shows that the slamming pressure peaks are higher compared to the values in the late stage however due to the decreased entry velocity the comparison between the non dimensional values is different table 2 lists the non dimensional peak values for the pressures on the bottom at the slamming stage the effects of fluid compressibility are below 10 for p5 and p6 in the two cases with different entry velocities comparing the two cases the values of cpmax1 are slightly lower when the initial entry speed is 2 5 m s however this slamming coefficient is around 5 in all the results at the late stage the values of cpmax2 from the case with v0 2 5 m s are much higher than the results in the other case in particular to the 2d models in the case with v0 0 92 m s the effect of fluid compressibility is around 14 5 in 2d model and 18 5 in 3d model when v0 2 5 m s the effects are very limited on 2d models but are around 32 on 3d models concerning the occurrence time of the peak pressures p4 p6 the slamming peak pressures occur when the penetration is 0 39 relative to vertical dimension of the body for 2d models as listed in table 3 for the compressible models the slamming peak happens earlier in 3d model and later in 2d model the occurrence time of cpmax2 is around 7 5 7 8 in v0 0 92 m s and around 10 2 10 4 for v0 2 5 m s table 4 compared the non dimensional peak values and occurrence time for the pressures on the top of the wedge cylinder the fluid compressibility has very limited effects on the occurrence time of the peak values while its effects on peak values are up to 50 for the case with v0 2 5 m s 5 conclusions the water entry of a wedge is simulated using the reynolds average navier stokes rans equations and volume of fluid vof method which are implemented in the open source library openfoam to investigate the effects of fluid compressibility and three dimensionality on the motions and hydrodynamic forces of the falling object both the interdymfoam and compressibleinterdymfoam solvers are applied in the study considering multi phase fluid and structure interaction problems the initial slamming transition collapse and post closure stages during the water entry of the wedge with are predicted considering two froude numbers the results of the numerical calculations are summarized as compared with the experimental data of the acceleration the numerical prediction from the 3d models agree better at the slamming stage while the 2d compressible model shows high oscillations at the later stage which are observed in the experiments as well considering the vertical motion and the entry velocity the fluid compressibility and three dimensionality have negligible effects at the slamming stage the three dimensional effects increase as the penetration depth increases while the effects of the fluid compressibility are much less in the whole process at the slamming stage the pressure evolutions predicted from all the models are in good agreement with the experimental measurements except that the initial impulses are observed in the experiments at the later stage the amplitude of the pressure peaks from the 3d compressible models agrees better with the measurements regardless of the oscillations while only the compressible 2d model captures the oscillations of the pressure from the predicted free surface evolutions and the time series results it is concluded that very high hydrodynamic force would occur when the air cavity closure happens and the fluid compressibility delays its closure considering the first peak in the pressure at the later stage the values predicted from 2d model are higher than the 3d computations whilst the results from the compressible models are lower compared to the ones obtained from the incompressible solver which is contrary to the comparison of the slamming pressure peaks at the initial stage it is found that the occurrence time of the peaks at slamming stage is almost the same for the same model with two different entry velocities it can be concluded that the maximum slamming force occurs around dp h 0 67 after the body touches the water surface for incompressible simulations while it occurs around dp h 0 74 for the compressible models based on these results the fluid compressibility can be neglected when the interest is focused on the slamming stage in particular for the case with a high froude number for a slamming problem the assumption of the 2d problem over predict the hydrodynamic force however a 2d simulation with a 3d correction factor may simplify the problem and decrease the computation efforts the hydrodynamic pressure that occurs during the closure of the air cavity could be higher than the slamming pressure in particular for the case with a low froude number it is necessary to take the fluid compressibility and three dimensionality into account when the air cavity dynamics are of interest credit authorship contribution statement shan wang methodology formal analysis visualization

the wedge during slamming and air cavity closure stage are analyzed together with the occurrence time of them keywords openfoam 3d water impact slamming pressure compressibility air cavity 1 introduction the research of water entry problems has many applications in various topics such as the slamming of high speed ships the landing of the space vehicle on the sea surface and the design of military projectiles entering water at high speed research work on this subject has been mainly focused on the assessment of impact loads on the body at the initial stage of water entry prediction of the water entry trajectory and understanding of the evolution of the air cavity behind the falling body after the initial impact as an important application in naval architecture the study of large hydrodynamic loads on surface ships and offshore structures subjected to water entry because of the large amplitude relative motions has been extensively performed the important pioneering study on this subject can be attributed to von kármàn 1929 and wagner 1932 who developed the theoretical models on the idealized problem of a two dimensional wedge impacting onto a calm water surface wagner s asymptotic solution has been applied and further developed by some researchers such as dobrovol skaya 1969 logvinovich 1973 howison et al 1991 and zhao et al 1996 recently the numerical tools have been widely used in slamming problems water entry of 2d wedge sections were simulated in maki et al 2011 wang and guedes soares 2013 southall et al 2014 ma et al 2016 and monroy et al 2016 while the ship section cases were investigated by ghadimi et al 2013 and wang and guedes soares 2014a a comparative study of a water entry problem was conducted in hong et al 2017 who compared the numerical results from different solutions e g openfoam star ccm sph cip and in house code with model test data these studies have been focused on the analysis of two dimensional structures since slamming on ships has been a major concern and the 2d strip theory has been widely used for predicting the relative motions of ships relative to waves such as the study of hermundstad and moan 2005 for bow flare slamming on a ro ro vessel and wang and guedes soares 2016a 2016b for the bow and stern slamming problems of a chemical tanker nevertheless the use of a strip theory assumes the ship hull to be slender which is not always true donguy et al 2001 mentioned that some problems arose when the strip theory was applied to study the local hydro elastic effects associated with several slamming events which exist significant three dimensional effects unlike the two dimensional problems fewer analytical solutions scolan and korobkin 2001 korobkin and scolan 2006 have been developed for the study on slamming of three dimensional bodies which mostly relies on experimental tests i e de backer et al 2009 mutsudab et al 2018 wang et al 2020 and numerical methods i e wang and guedes soares 2014b camilleri et al 2015 maruzewski et al 2010 facci et al 2016 xiang et al 2020 for example the experimental study on the water impact of 3d buoys in de backer et al 2009 was used in wang and guedes soares 2014b for validating the numerical ale results and in nguyen et al 2016 for evaluating the results from a navier stokes ns method with moving chimera grid two software packages openfoam and star ccm were utilized to predict the slamming loads on 2d ship sections and a 3d scaled model of a container ship advancing in incident waves by shen et al 2016 using the overset grid technique it was shown that both software over predicted the slamming loads on 2d cases and underestimate the green water impact force on 3d scaled ship model though their predictions of bow and bottom slamming forces agreed well with experiments water entry of ship models were investigated experimentally by some researchers such as mutsudab et al 2018 for a 3d stern model and wang et al 2020 for a 3d bow model for identifying the characteristics of the key parameters of bow and stern slamming pressures both the numerical work of camilleri et al 2015 and wang et al 2019a revealed that three dimensional effects had a significant influence on the pressure peaks particularly during the early stages of water entry most of the theoretical and numerical work on the slamming problems assumed an incompressible fluid flow because for ship slamming problems the entry velocity is rather small compared to the speed of sound in water and compressibility can generally be neglected wang and guedes soares 2017 however in cases where the deadrise angle is nearly zero the spray root and jet move at a speed much higher than the entry velocity and compressibility effects can be significant korobkin 1992 carcaterra and ciappi 2000 2004 honghui and takami 2001 the study of kleefsman et al 2005 and yang and qiu 2012 demonstrated the importance of including the air phase in the numerical simulation for the water entry problems the importance of the compressibility of the air has been studied e g yang and qiu 2012 southall et al 2014 elhimer et al 2017 indicating that the introduction of air compressibility seems to cause a slightly larger peak pressure with lagging of the instant when the peak pressure occurred bihnam et al 2017 concluded that the free surface profiles during the water impact were significantly influenced by the compressibility of the fluids as mentioned before the trajectory of the body and the air cavity formation in the later stage also interest the researchers who are working with the water entry problems for example vincent et al 2018 investigate the motion impact force splash and cavity evolution of a rigid wedge entering water as a function of the wedge opening angle showing that while the entry velocity does not have any noticeable effect on the shape of the cavity as noted previously in duclaux et al 2007 it does have a significant effect on the splash shape the air cavity effects on the water impact problems have been discussed for example in lee et al 1997 chu et al 2004 holland et al 2004 yan et al 2009 song b 2015 wang et al 2015a 2015b iranmanesh and passandideh fard 2017 and shi et al 2019 it has been confirmed that the formation of air cavity significantly influences the dynamics and trajectory of low speed projectiles e g chu et al 2004 holland et al 2004 water entry of a horizontal circular cylinder with low froude numbers was investigated numerically by iranmanesh and passandideh fard 2017 using the volume of fluid technique the results were validated against the experiments available in the literature and the formation of cavity was discussed considering the water entry of a projectile the results in chen et al 2019 showed that the compressibility effects play a significant role in the development of cavitation and the pressure inside the cavity wang et al 2015a developed theoretical models to analyze the loads motions and cavity dynamics for freefall wedges with different deadrise angles vertically entering the water surface showing that for froude number larger than the critical froude number the entry velocity decreases after the slamming stage as noticed in the experimental study of wang et al 2015b which showed also that the air compressibility matter the results in the stage of the closure of the cavity wang et al 2019a numerically investigate the water entry of the 2d and 3d wedge indicating that the 3d effects affect the slamming force peaks it was also observed that the hydrodynamic force profile in the post closure from the incompressible solver was different from the one obtained in the experiments of wang et al 2015b the vof based multiple phase solver adopting the deformation mesh method available in the openfoam is applied in this study for assessing the effects of the fluid compressibility on the vertical motion velocity hydrodynamic force and pressures on a rigid wedge entering into water by considering two initial entry velocities the formation of the air cavity on the top of the body and its effects on the body are discussed both 2d and 3d models are simulated using the incompressible and compressible fluid solvers by comparing the results from these models the effects of the fluid compressibility are analyzed together with the effects of the three dimensionality 2 numerical method the openfoam open source field operation and manipulation version applied in this study is 2 4 0 which is maintained by the openfoam foundation the navier stokes equations for a compressible flow of a newtonian fluid in vector form are 1 ρ u t ρ u u p 2 3 μ u μ u u μ ρ g σ κ α 1 α 1 where ρ is the density of the fluid u is the fluid velocity p is the pressure g is the acceleration of gravity μ is the dynamic viscosity σ is the surface tension coefficient к is curvature of the free surface α 1 is phase fraction of phase 1 and t represents the time the continuity equation is 2 ρ t ρ u 0 here the curvature of the free surface is calculated from the phase fraction as follows 3 κ α 1 α 1 the equation of state in the compressible vof method is given as 4 ρ i ρ 0 i ψ i p where ψ i is the compressibility factor ψ i 1 c i 2 and c i is the speed of sound and i means the phase for the compressible gas phase the nominal density ρ 0 is defined as zero which leads to an ideal gas equation for an isothermal fluid where ψ 1 r t with the gas constant r and the temperature t for the low compressibility water phase ρ 0 is equal to the nominal density of the liquid under normal conditions in general the density of water can be considered as constant unless the mach number is higher than 0 3 the volume of fluid vof method is used to track the free surface elevation this method determines the fraction of the fluid that exists in each cell the equation for the volume fraction is 5 α i t α i u i 1 α i α i u r 0 where α i is the volume fraction of phase in the cell and varies from 0 to 1 and 1 α i α i u r is an anti diffusion term utilized to sharpen the interface in vof method both fluids are treated as a single fluid mixture whose properties change in space based on the volume fraction of each phase 6 ρ α 1 ρ 1 α 2 ρ 2 7 μ α 1 μ 1 α 2 μ 2 8 α 1 α 2 1 the segregated solution algorithm used in the case of a compressible solver is the pimple

generation blockmesh and snappyhexmesh tools are applied to resolve the motion of the mesh mesh morphing around the geometry openfoam s dynamicmotionsolverfvmesh solver is utilized the sixdofrigidbodymotion function is used to capture the free movement of the wedges to capture the moving interface boundaries as well as model mesh motions and topology changes the interdymfoam and compressibleinterdymfoam solvers are applied for solving navier stokes equations respectively for incompressible and compressible fluid cases 3 computational model the tested wedge model in wang et al 2015b is utilized in the present study to investigate the evolution of slamming pressure the hydrodynamic loads wedge motions and evolution of the air cavity during the free falling process fig 1 shows the wedge cylinder arrangement and the locations of the pressure sensors in the test where the sensors p4 p5 are located on the bottom and p1 p3 are mounted on the top of the body the total mass of the wedge cylinder is 32 3 kg m and the initial entry speed is v0 0 92 m s and 2 50 m s the maximum froude number f n v 0 g c 0 with v0the initial entry speed g the acceleration of gravity and c0 the half width of the wedge is 1 02 and 2 77 respectively for the two cases both the 2d and 3d computations are performed fig 2 presents the numerical setup of the free falling water impact problems of 3d bodies the chosen cartesian coordinates are x direction is parallel to l1 y direction parallel to l2 and z direction parallel to the flume width l3 the x origin is located in the symmetric line of the body and y origin is located in the initial free surface elevation to build up the computational mesh the fluid domain is firstly created by using blockmesh with the dimension l1 l2 l3 the stl file describing the geometry of the rigid body is integrated into the flow domain by using snappyhexmesh and is defined as a moving wall for a freely falling body the sixdofrigidbodymotion scheme is applied to describe the motion of the body in deformation mesh method there is a limit for the motion of the body because large motion would induce distortion on the cells to eliminate the instabilities of the large motion the rigid body is located just above the water surface and released with an initial entry velocity the left right front and back boundaries of the computational domain are defined as walls together with the bottom side in the 2d numerical modelling the cell number in z direction is set to 1 and front and back patches are defined as empty in the experiments of wang et al 2015 the depth of the water is between 1 m and 1 2 m and the width of the tank is 0 4 m to enable the simulations with a higher movement on the dynamic mesh domain the dimensions of the fluid domain in openfoam is 2 4 m 0 8 air 1 2water 2 m parametric study of mesh size and the maximum courant number for openfoam simulations of water entry problems have been performed for 2d bodies in wang et al 2019b and for 3d bodies in wang et al 2019a which include the wedge cylinder here a computational model that enables the simulations with a relatively large motion and also provide satisfactory results is chosen because the same mesh resolutions and maximum courant number are utilized in all the simulations it is considered that numerical uncertainties would have little influence on the analysis of compressibility and three dimensionality the mesh resolutions are shown in fig 3 where the uniform cells are utilized in the middle and expanding ones are applied in other domains the maximum courant number is defined as 0 25 in the mesh generation the wedge body is created by cutting the meshes in the computational domain with a stl file containing the body geometry it contributes to the discrepancies of the model with the actual geometry on the edges shown in fig 3 b since the mesh size is very small relative to the dimensions of the body the effects of the uneven edges are neglected the total number of the cells is 47772 for 2d models and 7192932 for 3d models the simulation duration is 0 4 s and 0 5 s for the two cases respectively all the 3d simulations are performed on a regular desktop equipped with an intel core i7 4570 3 2 ghz 12 with 64 gb of ram memory 4 results and discussions the water entry process of the free falling wedge was divided into four stages slamming transition collapse and post closure stages by wang et al 2015b these four stages in water entry process of the wedge cylinder are simulated using openfoam considering fluid compressibility and 3d effects for the case with an initial velocity of 0 92 m s the numerical results of acceleration velocity motion and hydrodynamic pressures are compared with the experimental data from wang et al 2015b while the results from different models are compared for the case with v0 2 5 m s 4 1 comparisons of the motions fig 4 presents the numerical results of the vertical acceleration on the wedge during the water entry process during the slamming stage the acceleration increases gradually after the body touches the water surface due to the high change rate of the added mass and drops greatly when the flow separates from the body for the case with v0 0 92 m s it is clearly seen that the compressibility causes a slightly higher amplitude and a time lag on the peak values of the acceleration while the three dimensionality of the model leads to about 24 decrease on the peak values compared with the experimental peak value 1 58 m s2 the prediction of 3d compressible model is 1 85 m s2 which is about 17 higher while the value from 3d incompressible model is 19 lower for the case with v0 2 5 m s the similar three dimensional effect is found but the fluid compressibility does not matter the peak value much on the 3d cases after the flow separates from the fully submerged body the change rate of the added mass reduces greatly thus the acceleration drops comparing the results shown in fig 4 a with those in fig 4 b it is found that the acceleration increases gradually for the case with v0 0 92 m s while it does not change much during a long period of time for the case with v0 2 5 m s for the former case a low entry velocity leads to lower vertical acceleration resulting in smaller hydrodynamic force where the gravity of the body matters for the latter although the acceleration drops greatly the hydrodynamic force still dominates in the total force the numerical result from the 3d model with the compressible fluid agree better with the experimental data at this initial stage compared to the measured peak value the 3d compressible model provides a 17 higher result and 3d incompressible model has a 20 lower prediction the occurrence time of the peak value from experiments are very close to the ones in 3d simulations indicating that the water jet below the bottom of the body separates from the surface at almost the same time at the late stage of the process an air cavity is formed on the top of the wedge as the penetration depth of the body into water increases the gap above the air cavity becomes smaller resulting in the increase of the pressure in the cavity near the pinch off closure of the air cavity the gap becomes very narrow and the air flows out of the cavity with a very high velocity as seen in fig 4 a significant value of acceleration occurs downwards due to the high pressure in the air cavity near the pinch off after these peaks oscillations are observed in the 2d compressible computations this is consistent with the results observed in wang et al 2015b who mentioned that after the closure of the cavity the air compressibility matters inducing an oscillation of the cavity pressure and of the wedge acceleration however similar oscillations are not found in the 3d compressible computations in 3d simulations an air leakage could be formed during the oscillation of the cavity which causes a significant decay of the cavity pressure and leads to air flow in the longitudinal direction abrahamsen and faltinsen 2011 have mentioned that the damping due to heat transfer plays an important role on the decay of the oscillations and the entrapment of air pockets on walls by breaking waves would be one of the reasons as mentioned before the width of the tank in experiments is 0 4 m but the numerical tank is defined as 2 4 m in width to enable the large vertical motion of the body due to the differences the air leakage heat transfer and air flow in longitudinal direction in 3d simulations might be different from the experiments and 2d models in addition the longitudinal dimension of the numerical tank is only 2 m the damping due to the entrapment of air pockets on walls in longitudinal direction is likely one reason as well for both the two cases the occurrence of the increment on acceleration is the earliest in the 3d incompressible model the second in the 3d compressible model third in the 2d incompressible model and the last in the 2d compressible model this might be related with the pinch off time of the air cavity which will be discussed later with the plots of the evolution of the air cavity and the quantitative comparisons of the peak values and their occurrence time fig 5 and fig 6 compare the numerical results of the vertical motion and velocity of the wedge respectively considering that the slamming stage starts when the body touches the water surface and stops when the acceleration reaches a peak value it can be concluded that the fluid compressibility and three dimensionality do not affect the vertical motion of the body in the slamming stage in the later stage the three dimensional effects of the model cause some differences on the motion while the effects of fluid compressibility are little as to the vertical velocity of the wedge during the water entry process it is found that the evolution is completely different regarding the two cases for the case with v0 0 92 m s the entry velocity increases at the slamming stage decreases a little at the transition stage and it changes a lot during the formation of the air cavity for the case with v0 2 5 m s it increases a little bit when the body touches the water surface then decreases gradually until the closure of the air cavity which causes slight increase of the velocity similar to the motion of the body the effects of fluid compressibility and three dimensionality are negligible at the slamming stage however the three dimensionality do matter the results in the later stage and the influence of fluid compressibility is more apparent for the case with lower initial entry speed 4 2 comparisons of the hydrodynamic pressures fig 7 shows the numerical results of the pressure values p1 p6 from different models of the wedge with v0 0 92 m s together with the experimental measures from wang et al 2015b as shown in fig 1 the pressure sensors of p1 p3 are located near the edge of the 3d wedge in the longitudinal direction in the present 2d simulations all the probes are mounted in the middle of the elements for the 3d simulations the probes are located in the same points as shown in fig 1 a in addition to the probes p1 p6 the 3d simulations include six extra probes where pm means the sensors p1 p3 in the middle of the wedge in z axis and pil i 4 5 6 denote the sensors p4 p5 located in the same z coordinates of p1 p3 the comparisons of the pressures in the middle section with the ones near the edge enable the investigation of the three dimensional effects in the longitudinal direction as shown in fig 7 the initial peaks in p1 p3 occur when the acceleration drops greatly and the results from different models are consistent with the predicted accelerations for the pressures on the bottom of the wedge the initial pressure peaks occur at the slamming stage and they are lower compared to the peak values which happen during the closure of the air cavity at the slamming stage the pressure peaks from all the models occur almost at the same time moment however due to the effects of fluid compressibility and three dimensionality the peaks in the later stage occur at different moments at the slamming stage the pressure evolutions predicted from all the models are in good agreement with the experimental measurement except that the initial impulses are observed in the experiments at the later stage the amplitude of the pressure peaks from the 3d compressible models agrees better with the measurements regardless of the oscillations while only the compressible 2d model captures the oscillations of the pressure considering the first peak in the pressure at the later stage the values predicted from 2d model are higher than the 3d computations whilst the results from the compressible models are lower compared to the ones obtained from the incompressible solver which is contrary to the comparison of the slamming pressure peaks at the initial stage it can be seen also that when the 3d computation is performed the effects of the fluid compressibility are negligible comparing the pressures in the middle with the ones near the edge on the top of the 3d wedge i e pm with p1 p2 p3 it is seen that the first peaks from the former are slightly higher and the second peaks of the pressure occur in the middle on the top surface the second peaks predicted from the 3d compressible models have a time lag with the ones from the incompressible models these second peaks of the pressure could be explained by the water drops onto the top surface of the wedge after the closure of the air cavity the pressure peaks on the middle of the bottom are slightly higher than the ones near the edge both at the slamming and at the post closure stage fig 8 shows the numerical results of the pressure values p1 p6 from different models of the wedge with v0 2 5 m s for the pressures on the bottom of the wedge the peak values at the slamming stage are bigger than the ones predicted at the late stage the compressible models capture the oscillations in the pressure curves however the effects of the fluid compressibility on the peaks are negligible for the 2d models considering the first peaks in the late stage it is found that the results from the 2d models are higher than the ones from 3d models while the 3d compressible models provide lower results compared with the 3d incompressible solver the same results can be found for the pressures on the top surface of the wedge as seen in fig 7 initial impulses occur in the experiments for p4 and p5 but they are not captured in the simulations with v0 0 92 m s fig 8 shows better agreement on the initial peaks for the case with v0 2 5 m s it has been proposed by guedes soares 1989 that the slamming force is given by the sum of two components the first one is an impact component related to the impact of bottom on the water surface and characterized by a large peak with small duration the second one is given by the rate of change of the hydrodynamic momentum as the hull enters the water the theorem of impulse assumes that the maximum impact pressure is proportional to the quadratic impact velocity as 0 5ρkv t 2 where ρ is density of water k is a coefficient depending on the sectional geometry and v t is the simultaneous entry velocity for the case with v0 0 92 m s the initial impulse and the momentum components are both observed in the measured pressure curves while for the case with v0 2 5 m s it seems that the initial component dominates the pressures due to the high initial velocity in the author s previous numerical study on assessment of slamming pressures it was found difficult to capture the initial impulses for the case with a low entry velocity unless the simulation has very fine meshes and a very small time step which results in extremely high cpu there are also large numerical uncertainties on the predictions of the impulses in addition it has been justified that the initial impulses have little effect on the total slamming force motions and responses on a different context the occurrence of slamming on the bow flare of an fpso was studied in a detailed experimental study of the impact of waves in a plate at various inclination angles guedes soares et al 2007 it was observed that for the same conditions of passing waves the slamming identified as a large initial peak would only occur for certain values of the local wave steepness which explains why in some conditions the peak impulse can be detected and not in others 4 3 comparisons of the free surface elevation fig 9 compares the free surface elevation profiles predicted from the 2d simulations of the case with v0 0 92 m s as the air compressibility has limited effects on the slamming stage for the low froude cases the profiles after this stage are presented here at t 0 09s the water jet has separates from the body as seen for the 2d incompressible mode the water splash out like a continuous water jet when it comes to the 2d compressible model a lot of water droplets appear in the spray at t 0 18s the air cavity is larger due to the increased penetration of the body into the water in this collapse stage the acceleration increases gradually at t 0 32s the air cavity is closed for the incompressible model while a small gap still exists in the compressible case comparing with the time history of the pressures it can be concluded that the first peak values occur when the cavity is closed at t 0 44s a few water particles drop on the top of the wedge the shape of the cavity and free surface are almost the same for the two models fig 10 presents the evolutions of the free surface elevation for the 3d models with v0 0 92 m s including the profiles in x y and y z planes the selected time moments are as same as the ones in the 2d cases for the first two time moments the free surface elevations are similar to the ones in 2d cases and the air compressibility does not affect the results a lot at t 0 32s it is seen that the air cavity is closed and some water droplets are falling onto the top of the object in the x y plane while in y z plane the elevated water touches with the top of the edges of the wedge it can be found that the closure of the air cavity occurs earlier in the incompressible models comparisons between the 3d plots and the 2d ones show that the closure of the air cavity occurs earlier in 3d models fig 11 and fig 12 compare the free surface elevation profiles predicted from the numerical simulations of the case with v0 2 5 m s respectively for 2d and 3d models the differences of the generated wave elevation profiles from the incompressible and compressible models are observed on the water jet considering the profiles in x y plane or the ones from 2d models at t 0 197s it is found that the shape of the water jet from the compressible models are quite different observing the profiles in t 0 297s it is found that cavity closure occurs the earliest in the 3d incompressible model and it happens the latest in the 2d compressible model it is consistent with the comparisons of the occurrence time of the significant increment of acceleration and pressures in the late stage 4 4 non dimensional coefficients the time history of the motions velocity acceleration and pressures are presented above for the two cases combing with evolutions of the free surface elevation it is concluded that the slamming pressure peaks occur at the early stage and the second peak happens when the air cavity is closed for the two cases the time moments of the occurrence of these peaks are different in order to understand the water entry process in non dimensional time moments the non dimensional results will be presented here fig 13 compares the non dimensional acceleration for the two cases where the non dimensional time are given as dp h where dp is the penetration depth of the object into water and h is the vertical dimension of the object and the non dimensional acceleration is calculated using acc g where acc means the computed acceleration and g is the gravitational acceleration it seems that the peak values occur at the similar non dimensional time for each case in order to understand the differences between the peak values and the occurrence time from different models the results are listed in table 1 where a1 means the values of the maximum acceleration during the slamming stage a2 means the ones for the minimum values during the closure of the cavity and τ1 τ2 represent the time when a1 and a2 occur at the slamming stage the 3d effects are significant on the peak values for the two cases the compressibility causes 22 49 and 32 67 higher peaks value in the case with v0 0 92 m s for 2d and 3d models respectively in the case with v0 2 5 m s the effects are limited it is found that the occurrence time of the peaks at slamming stage is almost the same for the same model with two different entry velocities it can be concluded that the maximum slamming force occurs around dp h 0 67 after the body touches the water surface for the incompressible simulations while it occurs around dp h 0 74 for the compressible ones when it comes to the late stage the effects of the compressibility are significant the fluid compressibility delays the closure of the air cavity and affects the amplitude of the peak values for the 3d cases the absolute values of a2 from the 3d compressible models are 63 24 and 73 26 lower than the ones from the 3d incompressible simulations for the two cases when the 2d cases are considered it is found that the fluid compressibility has less effects on the values of a2 fig 14 and fig 15 compare the non dimensional pressure coefficients on p1 and p5 which is defined as cp p 0 5ρv2 where p is the computed pressures ρ is the density of water and v is the entry velocity shown in fig 7 the pressure sensor p1 is located on the top of the wedge and it is seen that the first peak values occur at the same time as the a2 happens comparing the slamming peak value with the first peak in the late stage for pressure p5 it is found that the non dimensional pressure occurs in the cavity post closure stage is much higher for both the two cases for the case with v0 2 5 m s fig 8 shows that the slamming pressure peaks are higher compared to the values in the late stage however due to the decreased entry velocity the comparison between the non dimensional values is different table 2 lists the non dimensional peak values for the pressures on the bottom at the slamming stage the effects of fluid compressibility are below 10 for p5 and p6 in the two cases with different entry velocities comparing the two cases the values of cpmax1 are slightly lower when the initial entry speed is 2 5 m s however this slamming coefficient is around 5 in all the results at the late stage the values of cpmax2 from the case with v0 2 5 m s are much higher than the results in the other case in particular to the 2d models in the case with v0 0 92 m s the effect of fluid compressibility is around 14 5 in 2d model and 18 5 in 3d model when v0 2 5 m s the effects are very limited on 2d models but are around 32 on 3d models concerning the occurrence time of the peak pressures p4 p6 the slamming peak pressures occur when the penetration is 0 39 relative to vertical dimension of the body for 2d models as listed in table 3 for the compressible models the slamming peak happens earlier in 3d model and later in 2d model the occurrence time of cpmax2 is around 7 5 7 8 in v0 0 92 m s and around 10 2 10 4 for v0 2 5 m s table 4 compared the non dimensional peak values and occurrence time for the pressures on the top of the wedge cylinder the fluid compressibility has very limited effects on the occurrence time of the peak values while its effects on peak values are up to 50 for the case with v0 2 5 m s 5 conclusions the water entry of a wedge is simulated using the reynolds average navier stokes rans equations and volume of fluid vof method which are implemented in the open source library openfoam to investigate the effects of fluid compressibility and three dimensionality on the motions and hydrodynamic forces of the falling object both the interdymfoam and compressibleinterdymfoam solvers are applied in the study considering multi phase fluid and structure interaction problems the initial slamming transition collapse and post closure stages during the water entry of the wedge with are predicted considering two froude numbers the results of the numerical calculations are summarized as compared with the experimental data of the acceleration the numerical prediction from the 3d models agree better at the slamming stage while the 2d compressible model shows high oscillations at the later stage which are observed in the experiments as well considering the vertical motion and the entry velocity the fluid compressibility and three dimensionality have negligible effects at the slamming stage the three dimensional effects increase as the penetration depth increases while the effects of the fluid compressibility are much less in the whole process at the slamming stage the pressure evolutions predicted from all the models are in good agreement with the experimental measurements except that the initial impulses are observed in the experiments at the later stage the amplitude of the pressure peaks from the 3d compressible models agrees better with the measurements regardless of the oscillations while only the compressible 2d model captures the oscillations of the pressure from the predicted free surface evolutions and the time series results it is concluded that very high hydrodynamic force would occur when the air cavity closure happens and the fluid compressibility delays its closure considering the first peak in the pressure at the later stage the values predicted from 2d model are higher than the 3d computations whilst the results from the compressible models are lower compared to the ones obtained from the incompressible solver which is contrary to the comparison of the slamming pressure peaks at the initial stage it is found that the occurrence time of the peaks at slamming stage is almost the same for the same model with two different entry velocities it can be concluded that the maximum slamming force occurs around dp h 0 67 after the body touches the water surface for incompressible simulations while it occurs around dp h 0 74 for the compressible models based on these results the fluid compressibility can be neglected when the interest is focused on the slamming stage in particular for the case with a high froude number for a slamming problem the assumption of the 2d problem over predict the hydrodynamic force however a 2d simulation with a 3d correction factor may simplify the problem and decrease the computation efforts the hydrodynamic pressure that occurs during the closure of the air cavity could be higher than the slamming pressure in particular for the case with a low froude number it is necessary to take the fluid compressibility and three dimensionality into account when the air cavity dynamics are of interest credit authorship contribution statement shan wang methodology formal analysis visualization
