4280,bangladesh a tropical low lying region is stranded between the bay of bengal in the south and the himalayas in the north the unique characteristics allow receiving huge rainfall in particular in the monsoon season the physical phenomena such as the bay of bengal the himalayas and the monsoon season dominate the extreme rainfall pattern in bangladesh however how to include that information to good effect in the estimation of extreme rainfall at ungauged locations is yet to be investigated the objective of this work is to examine the information that needs to be included in the estimation of extreme rainfall in such regions the approach that permits parameters of an extreme value distribution to vary spatially is used to determine the probability model the methodology subsequently authorizes the frequency analysis to be performed at ungauged conditions the geostatistical technique in the form of kriging with external drift ked which has the ability to take secondary information is used to produce spatial maps of the parameters this study primarily assessed ked interpolation scheme and its ability to accurately predict the model parameters the scheme was compared against the more widely used ordinary kriging ok model the cross validation was used to find the robust scheme for each parameter annual maximum daily rainfall data from 34 measuring stations were used for the assessment the ked with the covariate annual mean monsoon rainfall ammr appears to be the best model for location parameter however for the scale and shape parameter the ked models were unable to score past the ok model the availability of parameter maps allows the estimation of extreme rainfall at locations where rainfall records were absent and offers a much better elucidation than the traditional at site quantile based interpolation overall the inclusion of monsoon rainfall and spatial information are deemed necessary for the estimation of extreme rainfall at ungauged locations in a low lying monsoon region keywords extreme rainfall analysis spatial modelling spatial interpolation extreme value analysis monsoon climate 1 introduction extreme rainfall event is considered to be a major natural hazard because of the threat in the form of severe flooding and landslide risk it can pose to the lives and property in order to assess and manage those risks the estimation of extreme rainfall is a necessary step in hydrological studies rainfall peak data e g annual maximum data series of a certain duration are generally used in estimating extreme rainfall using the so called frequency analysis bonnin et al 2006 cunnane 1989 institute of hydrology 1999 koutsoyiannis 2004 svensson and jones 2010 a moderate to long data series at a site helps estimating the extreme rainfall at a return period standard in practice with satisfactory results hosking and wallis 1997 however lack of data especially the ungauged situation complicates the estimation scenario there are several approaches available to tackle the ungauged estimation with reasonable effect spatial interpolation in other words mapping the hazard is one of them beguería and vicente serrano 2006 carreau et al 2013 das 2018 szolgay et al 2009 yin et al 2018 the approach not only allows the estimation of hazard at locations where no hydro meteorological data exists but also permits the spatial distribution of the phenomena to be apprised which in turn can be useful in decision making process in the area of water resources engineering and management the methodology is involved in translating the point value estimated at different meteorological stations to the un sampled locations as a spatially continuous variable the method is advocated by beguería and vicente serrano 2006 when they produce probability maps of extreme rainfall in a spanish region the method in particular has also shown advantageous results against the popular regional method in a low lying region das 2018 a number of interpolation approaches particularly the superior geo statistical approaches can be applied in connection with the ungauged estimation carreau et al 2013 das 2018 szolgay et al 2009 but the techniques that use external information e g kriging with external drift are reported promising results das et al 2020b faulkner and prudhomme 1998 panthou et al 2012 thus the selection of covariates appropriate for kriging approaches is an important course of action in this methodology in this study the same kind of question is asked in the context of a low lying monsoon climate region like bangladesh bangladesh is a low lying country stranded between the bay of bengal in the south and the himalayas in the north the climate especially the extremes are greatly influenced by this unique phenomenon in particular by the summer monsoon system rahman and islam 2019 very often a high intensity of rainfall occurs in monsoon season which translates a flooding event that causes huge damage to the people and property the estimation of extreme rainfall quantile is thus a necessary component in flood risk assessment and management studies however it should be borne in mind that the spatial resolution of rainfall measuring stations is limited in comparison to developed countries estimation of extreme rainfall at ungauged locations is often sought by the practitioners hence a reliable ungauged estimation method is a necessary a previous study das 2018 conducted in this region showed that the kriging is a promising tool in estimating or mapping extreme rainfall when it is compared with a popular regional method however identifying suitable covariates that influence rainfall patterns and intensity unique to the study area for example information derived based on mountainous regions coastal areas and the monsoon season were not given the priority it is also appraised that the rainfall intensity and magnitude vary considerably in the tropics malhi and wright 2004 and the interpolation of extreme rainfall is deemed challenging in this condition it is expected that incorporating governing characteristics unique to this region can greatly improve the estimation so there is a scope to include those unique characteristics to the spatial model and assess the performance also in technical terms quantile based resulting from the application of extreme value theory interpolation was carried out in the earlier study a superior approach in the form of model parameter interpolation was not addressed it was identified that the approach based on model parameter interpolation performed better and it is regarded as a sound and theoretically correct approach beguería and vicente serrano 2006 das et al 2020b panthou et al 2012 therefore this is an opportunity to conduct a study on spatial distribution structure of model parameters of an extreme value distribution in the study area context the objectives of the study are as follows the first objective is to identify covariates that are unique to the study area and have the spatial coverage required for the study the second also the main objective is to determine the most robust spatial interpolation method for model parameters so that a methodology for estimating seamless spatial coverage of extreme rainfall can be achieved 2 methodology 2 1 extreme value modeling the common way to deal extreme value estimation in hydrology is the frequency analysis the use of annual maximum am data in extreme value estimation is a standard approach hence called annual maximum frequency model in hydrological frequency analysis cunnane 1989 das 2016 hosking and wallis 1997 the identification of a suitable probability distribution and the associated parameter estimation are the main challenges in a frequency analysis cunnane 1989 the generalized extreme value gev has emerged as a reliable distribution for frequency analysis worldwide bonnin et al 2006 das et al 2020a gaál et al 2008 papalexiou et al 2013 svensson and jones 2010 the distribution also possesses a theoretical basis to perform extreme value analysis coles 2001 gumbel 1941 the past studies also identify gev as the superior distribution for rainfall studies in bangladesh das 2017 thus the present study employs gev as the probability distribution for conducting frequency analysis there are several methods available to estimate parameters but the method of l moments has turned out to be the method of choice since its inception by hosking 1990 in the late 80s it has been shown that the method performed better than the traditional method of moments sankarasubramanian and srinivasan 1999 and equally good in comparison with the method of maximum likelihood hosking and wallis 1997 this study uses the gev that is parameterized by hosking and wallis 1997 it has three parameters location ξ scale α and shape κ 1 f x e e y y k 1 l o g 1 k x ξ α k 0 x ξ α k 0 the shape parameter κ determines the tail behaviour of the distribution for κ 0 the distribution reduces to gumbel distribution ev1 for κ 0 the distribution is lower bounded ev2 whereas for κ 0 the distribution is upper bounded ev3 the quantiles extremes in terms of return periods are estimated as follows 2 p t ξ α 1 l o g 1 1 t k k k 0 ξ α l o g l o g 1 1 t k 0 the parameters estimated by l moments are as follows 3 k 7 8590 c 2 9554 c 2 c 2 3 τ 3 l o g 2 l o g 3 4 α λ 2 k 1 2 k γ 1 k 5 ξ λ 1 α 1 γ 1 k k where λ 1 in eq 5 λ 2 in eq 4 and τ 3 in eq 3 are the l moment statistics respectively the 1st l moment 2nd l moment and the l skewness γ is the complete gamma function 2 2 ungauged estimation with the interpolation technique two approaches are generally taken into account when an ungauged estimation of extremes is carried out they are quantile das 2018 szolgay et al 2009 weisse and bois 2002 and the model parameter ceresetti et al 2012 das et al 2020b panthou et al 2012 yin et al 2018 based method the method based on model parameter is theoretically sound and offers a superior estimation over the quantile based interpolation the development of a spatially continuous probability model with this approach involves enabling the parameters of the generalized extreme value distribution to vary spatially the parameters are estimated at each gauging location using the same at site method afterwards they are spatially distributed based on the selected interpolation schemes each parameter has its own interpolation model thus finding an appropriate interpolation model for each parameter is a major task in this methodology the reason behind to have separate model for each parameter is explained among others by beguería and vicente serrano 2006 panthou et al 2012 and demonstrated by das et al 2020b the fact is that the effect of each gev parameter becomes different as the quantile corresponding to the return period gets higher this can be well understood by reviewing eq 2 the effect of the location parameter goes higher as the return level becomes lower conversely the effect of the shape parameter goes bigger as the return period becomes higher the influence of the scale parameter is detected persistently over a range of return periods upon successful formation of spatial interpolation models for the parameters of a frequency model one can produce different maps of quantiles according to the requirements without enterprising new spatial interpolations 2 3 spatial interpolation model a wide range of interpolation techniques namely deterministic and geostatistical methods chappell et al 2013 haberlandt 2007 hengl 2007 tabios and salas 1985 verworn and haberlandt 2011 webster and oliver 2007 have been used to construct the spatial continuity of rainfall fields using the gauged data however the geostatistical method in particular the use of multivariate geostatistical methods in combination with suitable covariates has generally given a superior performance in the estimation of extreme rainfall das et al 2020b faulkner and prudhomme 1998 panthou et al 2012 the kriging with external drift ked and its variants allow the inclusion of covariates in an appropriate way bostan et al 2012 goovaerts 2000 wagner et al 2012 the ked method is primarily used in this study in order to make a comparison with this approach a standard kriging approach namely the ordinary kriging ok is applied in this study a detail about kriging procedure can be obtained from webster and oliver 2007 here a brief description is presented in an interpolation method a variable in question is generally estimated at unknown locations p u 0 by taking into account the known values p u i from neighbors as follows 6 p u 0 i 1 n w i u 0 p u i where w i is the weight contributing to the interpolation the system of linear equations below is solved to obtain the weights for the ordinary kriging 7 i 1 n w i u 0 γ u i u j μ γ u j u 0 f o r a l l j i 1 n w i u 0 1 where γ u i u j is the semi variance between the sampled points u i and u j γ u j u 0 is the same for the gauged and ungauged points u j and u 0 and μ is the lagrange parameter with the ked the mean of the target variable depends on the external information in order to be efficient with the ked method the external information has to be available at all grids within the region and should be correlated with the interpolation variable the covariate in this technique is used to obtain the local mean of the variable the kriging procedure is then performed based on the residuals resulting from the mean the system of linear equations below is solved to obtain the weights for ked 8 i 1 n w i u 0 γ u i u j μ 0 k 1 k μ k y k u j γ u 0 u j f o r a l l j i 1 n w i u 0 1 i 1 n w i u 0 y k u i y k u 0 f o r k 1 2 k where γ u i u j are the residual semi variances between the sampled points u i and u j γ u 0 u j are the semi variances between the ungauged location and the gauged locations μ k f o r k 0 1 k are the lagrange multipliers and y k f o r k 1 2 k are the covariates the semi variance γ h which plays a pivotal role in kriging methods is estimated empirically from the datasets as follows 9 γ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h z u i z u i h 2 where h is the separation distance between two locations n h is the number of data pairs and z u i z u i h is the difference of values between locations u i and u i h in order to model the observed semi variance a theoretical semi variogram model is fitted to the empirically estimated semi variance in this work the widely used spherical model see isaaks and srivastava 1989 for details is employed for the semi variogram analysis 2 4 means of assessment the cross validation technique is used to assess the performance of maps of gev parameters produced by different interpolation methods the jackknife also known as leave one out cross validation is a widely used form of this technique daly 2006 with this method a particular station is removed at a time and the value of the concerned variable is estimated with the remaining stations the estimated value is then reserved for the removed station the estimated value was later compared with the observed value the procedure is repeated for all the stations the error statistics described in eq 10 13 were then used to compare results the standard cross validation procedure can be expanded to other forms in terms of leave out of multiple observed stations instead of one maintaining the same methodology one more case is considered in this direction to assess how data availability can affect the overall performance of the model the k fold in this study 5 fold cross validation pebesma and graeler 2019 is considered where the whole datasets is divided into 5 groups randomly and then a group is regarded as the validation set and the approach is fitted on the remaining 4 groups such conditions are deemed vital to reveal a different sensitivity of the trying technique to the lack of data a pragmatic situation for regions with data scarcity the widely used root mean square error rmse and the mean absolute error mae frazier et al 2016 lloyd 2005 ly et al 2011 and its percentage form rmse and mae are used to assess the overall performance between techniques they are defined below 10 rmse i 1 n x obs i x mod i 2 n 11 r m s e rmse 100 n i 1 n x obs i 12 mae i 1 n x obs i x mod i n 13 m a e mae 100 n i 1 n x obs i 3 study area and datasets 3 1 study area and rainfall data bangladesh is a low lying deltaic country the location of the country is shown in fig 1 where the land mass is covered by the bay of bengal in the south and the himalayan region in the north the country is quite flat with the three prominent rivers ganges brahmaputra and meghna formed deltaic basin occupies about 80 of the total area 147 600 km2 of the country the hilly regions can be found in the north east and south east part of the country which belongs to the greater himalayan hindu kush region the climate is tropical and it is characterized by the unique position of the country bay of bengal in the south and the himalayas in the north which influences monsoon and the variations in the rainfall krishnamurthy and shukla 2000 shahid 2010 bangladesh receives significant rainfall particularly during the monsoon season the monsoon typically last from june to september which covers 70 of the total annual rainfall 2400 mm in a year daily rainfall measurements mm from a network of 34 monitoring stations see fig 1 were collected from the bangladesh meteorological department which controls the quality of the data the south east part along the coast generally receives the highest amount of rainfall as it can be apprehended by the observed annual mean rainfall amr shown in fig 1 the relatively higher amr amounts in the north and the north east part can be credited to the effects of topography daily rainfall data from 1948 to 2012 were used for the analysis the annual maximum of daily rainfall series were extracted from the datasets not all the sites have the full series of annual maximum data the record length of selected stations varies from station to station 22 to 65 with the average value of 48 years of record 3 2 potential covariates selection of covariates requires several considerations primarily the covariates should be available at ungauged locations and be significantly correlated with the interpolation variable they should also be easy to access and be physically meaningful in the study area context over the years researchers were aiming to identify meaningful covariates which are significantly correlated with the variable in question the elevation is identified as an automatic choice since it is fairly related to rainfall field goovaerts 2000 lloyd 2005 geographical coordinates are recognized as useful covariates das 2018 they are widely used in kriging analysis with the advent of space technology remotely sensed data are relatively easy to obtain to take the advantage many recent studies used satellite rainfall as the suitable covariate verworn and haberlandt 2011 wagner et al 2012 in this study besides elevation and coordinates four other independent variables were considered as potential covariates the spatial distribution of these candidates is shown in fig 2 remotely sensed annual mean rainfall amr and annual mean monsoon rainfall ammr distance to himalayan regions dhr and distance to bay of bengal dbb are introduced to encapsulate the physical characteristics that influence the extreme behaviour of rainfall in the study area context the climate of bangladesh is primarily governed by the bay of bengal in the south and the himalayan region in the north the monsoon from the bay of bengal which brings huge amount of rainfall to bangladesh during the monsoon time june september determines the extent and extreme behaviour of rainfall the hilly regions in the northeast and southeast play a substantial role by inducing uplifting effects to the incoming monsoon results a considerable amount of rainfall in the vicinity of the area thus covariates derived from these phenomena could be meaningful candidates in the estimation of extreme rainfall the datasets of the considered candidates were obtained from the following sources the elevation data was extracted from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm accessed through http srtm csi cgiar org srtmdata the srtm dataset are available in the form of finished grade 3 arc second released by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and distributed by the usgs remotely sensed rainfall estimates amr and ammr were obtained from the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm a collaborative mission between the nasa and the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa designed to monitor and study tropical rainfall the rainfall estimates such as amr based on trmm has shown a good correlation with the observed amr in different regions of the world including bangladesh islam and uyeda 2007 thus the remotely sensed amr and ammr could be potential covariates for rainfall interpolation the trmm based amr compiled by bookhagen 2013 based on trmm 2b31 product is used in this study the ammr which is based on rainfall accumulated during the monsoon season june to september is extracted from amr the descriptor distance matrix from nearest coast to ungauged locations in this case distance from bay of bengal is measured based on the dataset of boundaries of coastal regions obtained from https www naturalearthdata com the descriptor distance matrix from himalayan regions to ungauged locations dhr on the other hand is measured based on the dataset of outline boundary of hindu kush himalayan hkh region obtained from https rds icimod org home datadetail metadataid 3924 4 analysis and result 4 1 at site estimation of model parameters and quantiles the gev model is applied to each annual maximum series to derive at site statistics the results of the at site estimation in the form of box plots are shown in fig 3 the plots for the gev parameter location ξ scale α and shape κ are shown respectively in fig 3a c the variation of the values results from the use of local estimates the parametrization of gev reveals that the value of shape parameter is most notable because it governs the upper tail of the distribution which is the main concern in extreme value analysis the positive and negative value of κ define respectively the bounded and unbounded condition the upper bounded condition should be used cautiously the situation is not suggested in engineering practice as it yields an insignificant difference in estimates between large return periods the at site estimate of κ varies from 0 31 to 0 18 mean value 0 093 with 8 positive values in the observed datasets the estimation of three parameters at a site allows a direct measurement of rainfall return period values four representative quantile values of different levels low p 10 medium p 50 high p 100 and very high p 1000 are plotted respectively in fig 3d g as expected the value becomes larger as the return period increases the same statistics are also plotted in map format to show their spatial distribution fig 4 a c show respectively the spatial plots of location ξ scale α and shape κ parameter in case of ξ higher estimates are observed in the south east along the bay of bengal north east along the mountainous region and northern area near the himalayan region lower estimates are located in the west and middle region this is reasonably similar to what have been noticed for observed annual mean rainfall see fig 1 the pattern holds true to some extent for α contrary the values of k are distributed in erratic manners this is rather logical as the shape parameter is appraised to be the most sensitive to the sampling hosking and wallis 1997 the inconvenient positive k values are designated by a specific yellowish see fig 4c colour this identifies areas with upper bounded situations which in turn generate a concern when a spatial map needs to be constructed the spatial plots for the considered quantile p 10 p 50 p 100 and p 1000 are displayed in fig 4d g the spatial pattern of p 10 and to some extent p 50 follow the similar pattern of ξ this is quite natural as the location parameter dominates in the estimation of low to medium return period values however at a high return period where k poses a greater dominance the quantile e g p 1000 gives an irregular pattern on display the scenario is well explained for a station named khepupara lat 21 98 lon 90 23 see figs 1 4 the at site estimates of parameters and quantiles read as follows ξ 156 9 α 63 3 κ 0 19 p 10 273 p 50 332 p 100 351 and p 1000 401 the value of ξ and p 10 are in similar zone see fig 4a d justifying its influence ξ on lower return period values however at a high return period the quantile suddenly falls in the lower range the corresponding κ is a positive value upper bounded condition signifying its substantial control over the quantile at a high return period see fig 4c g 4 2 covariate selection this section selects suitable covariates by carrying out regressions between gev parameters and potential covariates the aim is to find significant covariates which can be used in the ked system each parameter was regressed against the chosen covariates remotely sensed annual mean rainfall amr and annual mean monsoon rainfall ammr elevation elv distance from bay of bengal dbb distance from the himalayan regions dhr and geographical coordinates lat and lon table 1 shows the regression results for the gev parameters only the significant covariates are reported the significance level for this study is chosen to 5 ammr and dhr are identified as the significant covariates for ξ in case with α and κ elevation is the only significant covariate the r2 value 63 obtained for the location parameter can be considered reasonably good a lower value 11 is obtained for the scale parameter the regression of the shape parameter attained the lowest r2 9 which is expected from the higher uncertainty involved in its estimation the other candidates amr dbb lat and lon did not reveal any significant association with any gev parameters thus they are not taken into account further for ked analysis 4 3 semivariogram analysis variogram plays a pivotal role in presenting spatial variation of an interpolation variable a widely used variogram model namely the spherical model is used to fit the estimated empirical variogram in this study the analysis of variogram and subsequent kriging assessment were performed in r r core team 2017 the variograms including ok and ked cases are displayed in fig 5 for location parameter ξ the empirical and the corresponding fitted spherical semi variograms are shown in fig 5a d the same diagrams are displayed for α and κ respectively in fig 5e f and g h with regard to ok the spherical model is fitted to the empirical one quite well for the location and scale parameter the location parameter shows a linear trend suggesting its association with external variables which is proved in ked case regarding shape parameter a lack of spatial dependence is shown a high nugget effect suggests that the value fluctuates abruptly over short distances the variograms for ked schemes are also on display see fig 5b d f h variables that found significant were used in ked schemes the variograms are based on residuals originating from regression with the covariates this is appraised as the variation persisting after the local drift has been taken out sills of those variograms are expected to be smaller than those constructed for ok this aspect is quite obvious for location parameter as it can be seen from fig 5b d and table 2 the variograms for ked schemes ked ammr ked ammr dhr and ked dhr are able to reduce some sills considering that the covariates ammr and dhr are significantly correlated with the location parameter in contrast sills are barely reduced for scale and shape parameter see fig 5e g indicating they are not strongly correlated with the elevation see table 1 assessing the above variograms especially for the shape parameter the pure nugget could be a model option in which the sample mean is taken as the model value this consideration is quite common in spatial estimation das et al 2020b and in regional analysis das 2017 jin and stedinger 1989 this takes κ value to have 0 093 at ungauged locations in bangladesh which is unbounded and in principle appropriate for engineering applications based on the covariate and semi variogram analysis the spatial models compared for each parameter are listed in table 3 4 4 selection of best interpolation model this section presents the analysis to produce maps displaying the spatial distribution of parameters of the extreme value distribution the objective has been to construct spatial models for each gev parameter which in turn provides a spatial probability model when applied in composite manner the superior interpolation models are identified to produce spatial maps for each parameter fig 6 a d display maps for the location parameter generated by the ok ked ammr ked ammr dhr and ked dhr respectively fig 6e f display maps for the scale parameter produced by the ok and ked elv respectively while fig 6g h display the same for the shape parameter point estimates are used in the construction of maps thus interpolation techniques are responsible for varying nature of maps in an individual case the maps produced for location parameter show that the value is in general larger in the north and north east region and in the south along the coast and south east region near to the mountainous region lower values are especially recognized in the west and middle region which is quite distinct the spatial pattern of ξ mimics aptly the general pattern of the rainfall in the area a gradual trend from the west to the east see fig 1 maps generated by all the methods are quite smooth and the spatial distributions are fairly similar the maps by ked ammr and ked ammr dhr are rather complex showing the shape of ammr the maps produced for α to some degree give similar spatial patterns but the distinction in the middle areas is not that strong the ked elv model in addition induced a distinct area in the south east mountainous region due to its correlation with the elevation in contrast the distribution of κ is slightly different as shown in fig 6g h the ok model is quite uniform and the value is below zero in most of the cases presenting its non bounded form however with the ked elv model the influence of elevation is found in some areas of the south east mountainous region taking κ to positive values bounded condition in order to identify an appropriate model examining the spatial pattern is not enough a more objective namely the cross validation is required for the evaluation purpose two cases of cross validation were appraised which have been explained in sec 2 4 a summary of cross validation assessment based on 34 stations is given in table 4 the leave one out form of cross validation selects the ked with ammr as the best scheme for ξ with an rmse of 14 69 mm 10 93 and mae of 10 9 mm 8 11 with regard to α the ked scheme with elv was unable to score past the ok method the ok model is found superior with an rmse of 6 65 15 65 and mae of 4 97 11 71 the same ked scheme in shape parameter context was also compared against the ok and the constant mean cm model the cm model attained the highest error the other two give quite the same results in terms of rmse 0 12 and the difference is quite insignificant to be able to select the right one however with the ked scheme positive values were identified in some areas of the south east mountainous region which in turn give bounded conditions in extreme value estimates the situation is generally not recommended in practice thus the ok model is preferred a similar result was obtained when a data shortage case 5 fold cross validation is considered data scarcity does not affect the model selection hence the models identified are considered to be robust to some degree in the study area context 4 5 assessment of predicted quantile the availability of parameter maps allows the estimation of extreme rainfall at locations where rainfall records were absent fig 7 displays the spatial distribution of selected magnitude of 10 50 100 1000 year return period rainfall in general the greatest hazard or heaviest magnitude is expected along the coast in particular near the chittagong and in the north and north east area adjacent to the himalayan hindu kush region this can be explained by the influence of monsoon that generates from the south the lowest amount is expected in the western part and to some extent in the central areas these parts are isolated from the air masses originated from the bay of bengal they are also quite far from the mountainous region in the north the findings are supported by shahid and behrawan 2008 where they found that the level of aridity is quite high in this area a comparison is presented against the quantile value calculated using the observed at site data the selected spatial models are applied to predict parameters at gauging stations with the help of leave one out cross validation technique the parameters obtained are used to predict quantiles at the same gauged stations the residual errors are calculated by subtracting the predicted quantile value from the observed quantile estimated based on observed data a positive error is appraised under prediction the errors are used to construct bubble plots displaying the performance across the region the plots are produced for four cases 10 50 100 and 1000 year quantile they are shown in fig 8 in general errors increased as the return period increases overestimation is prominent in lower quantile case but as the return period increases the underestimation has more cases the reason is the shape parameter which influences the higher return period values there are several cases where high negative 0 2 values unbounded condition are noticed in observed data see 4c however in the model prediction the values in those cases are around 0 05 see fig 6g as a result the observed estimated values are greater than the model values higher errors in general are detected along the south east coast where highest rainfall occur the most other areas particularly the middle west mostly experience low to medium errors the quantile map produced by the parameter model is compared to the map produced based on quantile interpolation the quantile interpolation map is constructed using the at site estimate of quantile and the value is translated to the un sampled locations using the ok model see fig 9 the maps are quite comparable in low return period events see figs 9a and 7 the situation where the location parameter dominates however as the return period increases so as the dominance of shape parameter the map based on quantile interpolation falters and the distinction between the low and high value diminishes to null see fig 9d thus the spatial map based on quantile value should be avoided in practice 5 discussion the results clearly show that the information about monsoon rainfall and spatial data play a key role in the modeling of extreme rainfall which complement the previous studies das 2018 2017 on the behaviour of region s extreme rainfall the information about monsoon rainfall plays a critical role when the region of influence roi approach of regional analysis is used to delineate homogeneous groups in the estimation of extreme rainfall das 2017 spatial information is found significant when the growth factor of regional estimate is compared against the spatial interpolation das 2018 this study includes both the information diligently which is an improvement in the technical aspect in the form of model parameter interpolation as well the amalgamation of different information the study recognized that a strongly correlated variate such as ammr performed well in the ked analysis however a loosely correlated but significant covariate elevation did not perform significantly well in this regard a strongly correlated covariate hence has a greater chance to succeed with the ked method which in turn provides an efficient estimate therefore the search for effective covariates in scale and shape parameter context should be encouraged another crucial point of discussion is the modelling of shape parameter which is uncertain by nature the spatial modelling of shape parameter using the ok method sees an enhancement over considering a regional mean value the application of regional mean is quite common whether it is used in spatial estimation das et al 2020b or regional frequency analysis das 2017 jin and stedinger 1989 the shape parameter influences the most in high return level estimates e g p 100 which are often required in hydraulic designs the unbounded condition is not only desirable at present conditions but also in the backdrop of climate change as it permits the growth of magnitudes between high return periods bangladesh is listed as one of the highly vulnerable country to the impacts of climate change the occurrence of more intense and heavy extreme rainfall is expected under climate change shahid et al 2016 thus the modelling of shape parameter which gives the unbounded condition covers the climate change impact in the appropriate manner 6 conclusion this study deals with the issue of mapping the extreme rainfall by combining the extreme value modelling with the interpolation method the approach that permits parameters of an extreme value distribution to vary spatially is used to determine the probability model the methodology subsequently authorizes the frequency analysis to be performed at ungauged conditions the primary objective has been to determine robust spatial models for the parameters of an extreme value distribution which is suitable in bangladesh context attempts have been carried out to find suitable covariates that can be incorporated appropriately in the kriging system the covariates were chosen diligently to encapsulate physical characteristics that influence the extreme behaviour of rainfall in the study area this study primarily assessed ked interpolation technique which has the ability to include covariates the ok model was included to compare against the ked models the cross validation was implemented to find the pertinent scheme for each parameter annual maximum daily rainfall data from 34 measuring stations were used for the assessment the following conclusions are obtained from the study covariates that deemed suitable remotely sensed annual mean rainfall and annual mean monsoon rainfall ammr and others such as distance from the bay of bengal distance from the himalayan regions dhr and elevation were identified and their spatial coverage were derived for the study area the ammr and dhr are significantly correlated with the location parameter the elevation is found correlated with the other gev parameters scale and shape the ked appears to be the best model for location parameter the association of ammr with the model gives the best result the ok is identified as the superior model for scale parameter the model attained a lower error in comparison with the ked model the same model is also found suitable for the shape parameter which is regarded as an enhancement over considering a regional mean value the availability of parameter maps allows the estimation of extreme rainfall at locations where rainfall records were absent the greatest hazard or heaviest rainfall is expected along the coast and in the north and north east area adjacent to the himalayan hindu kush region the lowest amount is expected in the western part and to some extent in the central areas of bangladesh the residual error increases with the increase of return period overestimation is prominent in lower quantiles however in higher quantiles underestimations are noticed due to the effect of shape parameter the composite parameter based probability model offers an improved estimation when it compared with the traditional at site quantile based interpolation annual maximum series of 1 day rainfall is considered in this study other durations of rainfall extremes should be appraised in the future to see their performance in this condition overall the outcome is expected to help research communities to advance the related research and identify the corresponding covariates in different geographical and climatic conditions which will ultimately give an overall consensus about the extreme rainfall estimation at ungauged locations worldwide credit authorship contribution statement samiran das conceptualization data curation

4280,bangladesh a tropical low lying region is stranded between the bay of bengal in the south and the himalayas in the north the unique characteristics allow receiving huge rainfall in particular in the monsoon season the physical phenomena such as the bay of bengal the himalayas and the monsoon season dominate the extreme rainfall pattern in bangladesh however how to include that information to good effect in the estimation of extreme rainfall at ungauged locations is yet to be investigated the objective of this work is to examine the information that needs to be included in the estimation of extreme rainfall in such regions the approach that permits parameters of an extreme value distribution to vary spatially is used to determine the probability model the methodology subsequently authorizes the frequency analysis to be performed at ungauged conditions the geostatistical technique in the form of kriging with external drift ked which has the ability to take secondary information is used to produce spatial maps of the parameters this study primarily assessed ked interpolation scheme and its ability to accurately predict the model parameters the scheme was compared against the more widely used ordinary kriging ok model the cross validation was used to find the robust scheme for each parameter annual maximum daily rainfall data from 34 measuring stations were used for the assessment the ked with the covariate annual mean monsoon rainfall ammr appears to be the best model for location parameter however for the scale and shape parameter the ked models were unable to score past the ok model the availability of parameter maps allows the estimation of extreme rainfall at locations where rainfall records were absent and offers a much better elucidation than the traditional at site quantile based interpolation overall the inclusion of monsoon rainfall and spatial information are deemed necessary for the estimation of extreme rainfall at ungauged locations in a low lying monsoon region keywords extreme rainfall analysis spatial modelling spatial interpolation extreme value analysis monsoon climate 1 introduction extreme rainfall event is considered to be a major natural hazard because of the threat in the form of severe flooding and landslide risk it can pose to the lives and property in order to assess and manage those risks the estimation of extreme rainfall is a necessary step in hydrological studies rainfall peak data e g annual maximum data series of a certain duration are generally used in estimating extreme rainfall using the so called frequency analysis bonnin et al 2006 cunnane 1989 institute of hydrology 1999 koutsoyiannis 2004 svensson and jones 2010 a moderate to long data series at a site helps estimating the extreme rainfall at a return period standard in practice with satisfactory results hosking and wallis 1997 however lack of data especially the ungauged situation complicates the estimation scenario there are several approaches available to tackle the ungauged estimation with reasonable effect spatial interpolation in other words mapping the hazard is one of them beguería and vicente serrano 2006 carreau et al 2013 das 2018 szolgay et al 2009 yin et al 2018 the approach not only allows the estimation of hazard at locations where no hydro meteorological data exists but also permits the spatial distribution of the phenomena to be apprised which in turn can be useful in decision making process in the area of water resources engineering and management the methodology is involved in translating the point value estimated at different meteorological stations to the un sampled locations as a spatially continuous variable the method is advocated by beguería and vicente serrano 2006 when they produce probability maps of extreme rainfall in a spanish region the method in particular has also shown advantageous results against the popular regional method in a low lying region das 2018 a number of interpolation approaches particularly the superior geo statistical approaches can be applied in connection with the ungauged estimation carreau et al 2013 das 2018 szolgay et al 2009 but the techniques that use external information e g kriging with external drift are reported promising results das et al 2020b faulkner and prudhomme 1998 panthou et al 2012 thus the selection of covariates appropriate for kriging approaches is an important course of action in this methodology in this study the same kind of question is asked in the context of a low lying monsoon climate region like bangladesh bangladesh is a low lying country stranded between the bay of bengal in the south and the himalayas in the north the climate especially the extremes are greatly influenced by this unique phenomenon in particular by the summer monsoon system rahman and islam 2019 very often a high intensity of rainfall occurs in monsoon season which translates a flooding event that causes huge damage to the people and property the estimation of extreme rainfall quantile is thus a necessary component in flood risk assessment and management studies however it should be borne in mind that the spatial resolution of rainfall measuring stations is limited in comparison to developed countries estimation of extreme rainfall at ungauged locations is often sought by the practitioners hence a reliable ungauged estimation method is a necessary a previous study das 2018 conducted in this region showed that the kriging is a promising tool in estimating or mapping extreme rainfall when it is compared with a popular regional method however identifying suitable covariates that influence rainfall patterns and intensity unique to the study area for example information derived based on mountainous regions coastal areas and the monsoon season were not given the priority it is also appraised that the rainfall intensity and magnitude vary considerably in the tropics malhi and wright 2004 and the interpolation of extreme rainfall is deemed challenging in this condition it is expected that incorporating governing characteristics unique to this region can greatly improve the estimation so there is a scope to include those unique characteristics to the spatial model and assess the performance also in technical terms quantile based resulting from the application of extreme value theory interpolation was carried out in the earlier study a superior approach in the form of model parameter interpolation was not addressed it was identified that the approach based on model parameter interpolation performed better and it is regarded as a sound and theoretically correct approach beguería and vicente serrano 2006 das et al 2020b panthou et al 2012 therefore this is an opportunity to conduct a study on spatial distribution structure of model parameters of an extreme value distribution in the study area context the objectives of the study are as follows the first objective is to identify covariates that are unique to the study area and have the spatial coverage required for the study the second also the main objective is to determine the most robust spatial interpolation method for model parameters so that a methodology for estimating seamless spatial coverage of extreme rainfall can be achieved 2 methodology 2 1 extreme value modeling the common way to deal extreme value estimation in hydrology is the frequency analysis the use of annual maximum am data in extreme value estimation is a standard approach hence called annual maximum frequency model in hydrological frequency analysis cunnane 1989 das 2016 hosking and wallis 1997 the identification of a suitable probability distribution and the associated parameter estimation are the main challenges in a frequency analysis cunnane 1989 the generalized extreme value gev has emerged as a reliable distribution for frequency analysis worldwide bonnin et al 2006 das et al 2020a gaál et al 2008 papalexiou et al 2013 svensson and jones 2010 the distribution also possesses a theoretical basis to perform extreme value analysis coles 2001 gumbel 1941 the past studies also identify gev as the superior distribution for rainfall studies in bangladesh das 2017 thus the present study employs gev as the probability distribution for conducting frequency analysis there are several methods available to estimate parameters but the method of l moments has turned out to be the method of choice since its inception by hosking 1990 in the late 80s it has been shown that the method performed better than the traditional method of moments sankarasubramanian and srinivasan 1999 and equally good in comparison with the method of maximum likelihood hosking and wallis 1997 this study uses the gev that is parameterized by hosking and wallis 1997 it has three parameters location ξ scale α and shape κ 1 f x e e y y k 1 l o g 1 k x ξ α k 0 x ξ α k 0 the shape parameter κ determines the tail behaviour of the distribution for κ 0 the distribution reduces to gumbel distribution ev1 for κ 0 the distribution is lower bounded ev2 whereas for κ 0 the distribution is upper bounded ev3 the quantiles extremes in terms of return periods are estimated as follows 2 p t ξ α 1 l o g 1 1 t k k k 0 ξ α l o g l o g 1 1 t k 0 the parameters estimated by l moments are as follows 3 k 7 8590 c 2 9554 c 2 c 2 3 τ 3 l o g 2 l o g 3 4 α λ 2 k 1 2 k γ 1 k 5 ξ λ 1 α 1 γ 1 k k where λ 1 in eq 5 λ 2 in eq 4 and τ 3 in eq 3 are the l moment statistics respectively the 1st l moment 2nd l moment and the l skewness γ is the complete gamma function 2 2 ungauged estimation with the interpolation technique two approaches are generally taken into account when an ungauged estimation of extremes is carried out they are quantile das 2018 szolgay et al 2009 weisse and bois 2002 and the model parameter ceresetti et al 2012 das et al 2020b panthou et al 2012 yin et al 2018 based method the method based on model parameter is theoretically sound and offers a superior estimation over the quantile based interpolation the development of a spatially continuous probability model with this approach involves enabling the parameters of the generalized extreme value distribution to vary spatially the parameters are estimated at each gauging location using the same at site method afterwards they are spatially distributed based on the selected interpolation schemes each parameter has its own interpolation model thus finding an appropriate interpolation model for each parameter is a major task in this methodology the reason behind to have separate model for each parameter is explained among others by beguería and vicente serrano 2006 panthou et al 2012 and demonstrated by das et al 2020b the fact is that the effect of each gev parameter becomes different as the quantile corresponding to the return period gets higher this can be well understood by reviewing eq 2 the effect of the location parameter goes higher as the return level becomes lower conversely the effect of the shape parameter goes bigger as the return period becomes higher the influence of the scale parameter is detected persistently over a range of return periods upon successful formation of spatial interpolation models for the parameters of a frequency model one can produce different maps of quantiles according to the requirements without enterprising new spatial interpolations 2 3 spatial interpolation model a wide range of interpolation techniques namely deterministic and geostatistical methods chappell et al 2013 haberlandt 2007 hengl 2007 tabios and salas 1985 verworn and haberlandt 2011 webster and oliver 2007 have been used to construct the spatial continuity of rainfall fields using the gauged data however the geostatistical method in particular the use of multivariate geostatistical methods in combination with suitable covariates has generally given a superior performance in the estimation of extreme rainfall das et al 2020b faulkner and prudhomme 1998 panthou et al 2012 the kriging with external drift ked and its variants allow the inclusion of covariates in an appropriate way bostan et al 2012 goovaerts 2000 wagner et al 2012 the ked method is primarily used in this study in order to make a comparison with this approach a standard kriging approach namely the ordinary kriging ok is applied in this study a detail about kriging procedure can be obtained from webster and oliver 2007 here a brief description is presented in an interpolation method a variable in question is generally estimated at unknown locations p u 0 by taking into account the known values p u i from neighbors as follows 6 p u 0 i 1 n w i u 0 p u i where w i is the weight contributing to the interpolation the system of linear equations below is solved to obtain the weights for the ordinary kriging 7 i 1 n w i u 0 γ u i u j μ γ u j u 0 f o r a l l j i 1 n w i u 0 1 where γ u i u j is the semi variance between the sampled points u i and u j γ u j u 0 is the same for the gauged and ungauged points u j and u 0 and μ is the lagrange parameter with the ked the mean of the target variable depends on the external information in order to be efficient with the ked method the external information has to be available at all grids within the region and should be correlated with the interpolation variable the covariate in this technique is used to obtain the local mean of the variable the kriging procedure is then performed based on the residuals resulting from the mean the system of linear equations below is solved to obtain the weights for ked 8 i 1 n w i u 0 γ u i u j μ 0 k 1 k μ k y k u j γ u 0 u j f o r a l l j i 1 n w i u 0 1 i 1 n w i u 0 y k u i y k u 0 f o r k 1 2 k where γ u i u j are the residual semi variances between the sampled points u i and u j γ u 0 u j are the semi variances between the ungauged location and the gauged locations μ k f o r k 0 1 k are the lagrange multipliers and y k f o r k 1 2 k are the covariates the semi variance γ h which plays a pivotal role in kriging methods is estimated empirically from the datasets as follows 9 γ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h z u i z u i h 2 where h is the separation distance between two locations n h is the number of data pairs and z u i z u i h is the difference of values between locations u i and u i h in order to model the observed semi variance a theoretical semi variogram model is fitted to the empirically estimated semi variance in this work the widely used spherical model see isaaks and srivastava 1989 for details is employed for the semi variogram analysis 2 4 means of assessment the cross validation technique is used to assess the performance of maps of gev parameters produced by different interpolation methods the jackknife also known as leave one out cross validation is a widely used form of this technique daly 2006 with this method a particular station is removed at a time and the value of the concerned variable is estimated with the remaining stations the estimated value is then reserved for the removed station the estimated value was later compared with the observed value the procedure is repeated for all the stations the error statistics described in eq 10 13 were then used to compare results the standard cross validation procedure can be expanded to other forms in terms of leave out of multiple observed stations instead of one maintaining the same methodology one more case is considered in this direction to assess how data availability can affect the overall performance of the model the k fold in this study 5 fold cross validation pebesma and graeler 2019 is considered where the whole datasets is divided into 5 groups randomly and then a group is regarded as the validation set and the approach is fitted on the remaining 4 groups such conditions are deemed vital to reveal a different sensitivity of the trying technique to the lack of data a pragmatic situation for regions with data scarcity the widely used root mean square error rmse and the mean absolute error mae frazier et al 2016 lloyd 2005 ly et al 2011 and its percentage form rmse and mae are used to assess the overall performance between techniques they are defined below 10 rmse i 1 n x obs i x mod i 2 n 11 r m s e rmse 100 n i 1 n x obs i 12 mae i 1 n x obs i x mod i n 13 m a e mae 100 n i 1 n x

bengal in the south and the himalayan region in the north the country is quite flat with the three prominent rivers ganges brahmaputra and meghna formed deltaic basin occupies about 80 of the total area 147 600 km2 of the country the hilly regions can be found in the north east and south east part of the country which belongs to the greater himalayan hindu kush region the climate is tropical and it is characterized by the unique position of the country bay of bengal in the south and the himalayas in the north which influences monsoon and the variations in the rainfall krishnamurthy and shukla 2000 shahid 2010 bangladesh receives significant rainfall particularly during the monsoon season the monsoon typically last from june to september which covers 70 of the total annual rainfall 2400 mm in a year daily rainfall measurements mm from a network of 34 monitoring stations see fig 1 were collected from the bangladesh meteorological department which controls the quality of the data the south east part along the coast generally receives the highest amount of rainfall as it can be apprehended by the observed annual mean rainfall amr shown in fig 1 the relatively higher amr amounts in the north and the north east part can be credited to the effects of topography daily rainfall data from 1948 to 2012 were used for the analysis the annual maximum of daily rainfall series were extracted from the datasets not all the sites have the full series of annual maximum data the record length of selected stations varies from station to station 22 to 65 with the average value of 48 years of record 3 2 potential covariates selection of covariates requires several considerations primarily the covariates should be available at ungauged locations and be significantly correlated with the interpolation variable they should also be easy to access and be physically meaningful in the study area context over the years researchers were aiming to identify meaningful covariates which are significantly correlated with the variable in question the elevation is identified as an automatic choice since it is fairly related to rainfall field goovaerts 2000 lloyd 2005 geographical coordinates are recognized as useful covariates das 2018 they are widely used in kriging analysis with the advent of space technology remotely sensed data are relatively easy to obtain to take the advantage many recent studies used satellite rainfall as the suitable covariate verworn and haberlandt 2011 wagner et al 2012 in this study besides elevation and coordinates four other independent variables were considered as potential covariates the spatial distribution of these candidates is shown in fig 2 remotely sensed annual mean rainfall amr and annual mean monsoon rainfall ammr distance to himalayan regions dhr and distance to bay of bengal dbb are introduced to encapsulate the physical characteristics that influence the extreme behaviour of rainfall in the study area context the climate of bangladesh is primarily governed by the bay of bengal in the south and the himalayan region in the north the monsoon from the bay of bengal which brings huge amount of rainfall to bangladesh during the monsoon time june september determines the extent and extreme behaviour of rainfall the hilly regions in the northeast and southeast play a substantial role by inducing uplifting effects to the incoming monsoon results a considerable amount of rainfall in the vicinity of the area thus covariates derived from these phenomena could be meaningful candidates in the estimation of extreme rainfall the datasets of the considered candidates were obtained from the following sources the elevation data was extracted from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm accessed through http srtm csi cgiar org srtmdata the srtm dataset are available in the form of finished grade 3 arc second released by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and distributed by the usgs remotely sensed rainfall estimates amr and ammr were obtained from the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm a collaborative mission between the nasa and the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa designed to monitor and study tropical rainfall the rainfall estimates such as amr based on trmm has shown a good correlation with the observed amr in different regions of the world including bangladesh islam and uyeda 2007 thus the remotely sensed amr and ammr could be potential covariates for rainfall interpolation the trmm based amr compiled by bookhagen 2013 based on trmm 2b31 product is used in this study the ammr which is based on rainfall accumulated during the monsoon season june to september is extracted from amr the descriptor distance matrix from nearest coast to ungauged locations in this case distance from bay of bengal is measured based on the dataset of boundaries of coastal regions obtained from https www naturalearthdata com the descriptor distance matrix from himalayan regions to ungauged locations dhr on the other hand is measured based on the dataset of outline boundary of hindu kush himalayan hkh region obtained from https rds icimod org home datadetail metadataid 3924 4 analysis and result 4 1 at site estimation of model parameters and quantiles the gev model is applied to each annual maximum series to derive at site statistics the results of the at site estimation in the form of box plots are shown in fig 3 the plots for the gev parameter location ξ scale α and shape κ are shown respectively in fig 3a c the variation of the values results from the use of local estimates the parametrization of gev reveals that the value of shape parameter is most notable because it governs the upper tail of the distribution which is the main concern in extreme value analysis the positive and negative value of κ define respectively the bounded and unbounded condition the upper bounded condition should be used cautiously the situation is not suggested in engineering practice as it yields an insignificant difference in estimates between large return periods the at site estimate of κ varies from 0 31 to 0 18 mean value 0 093 with 8 positive values in the observed datasets the estimation of three parameters at a site allows a direct measurement of rainfall return period values four representative quantile values of different levels low p 10 medium p 50 high p 100 and very high p 1000 are plotted respectively in fig 3d g as expected the value becomes larger as the return period increases the same statistics are also plotted in map format to show their spatial distribution fig 4 a c show respectively the spatial plots of location ξ scale α and shape κ parameter in case of ξ higher estimates are observed in the south east along the bay of bengal north east along the mountainous region and northern area near the himalayan region lower estimates are located in the west and middle region this is reasonably similar to what have been noticed for observed annual mean rainfall see fig 1 the pattern holds true to some extent for α contrary the values of k are distributed in erratic manners this is rather logical as the shape parameter is appraised to be the most sensitive to the sampling hosking and wallis 1997 the inconvenient positive k values are designated by a specific yellowish see fig 4c colour this identifies areas with upper bounded situations which in turn generate a concern when a spatial map needs to be constructed the spatial plots for the considered quantile p 10 p 50 p 100 and p 1000 are displayed in fig 4d g the spatial pattern of p 10 and to some extent p 50 follow the similar pattern of ξ this is quite natural as the location parameter dominates in the estimation of low to medium return period values however at a high return period where k poses a greater dominance the quantile e g p 1000 gives an irregular pattern on display the scenario is well explained for a station named khepupara lat 21 98 lon 90 23 see figs 1 4 the at site estimates of parameters and quantiles read as follows ξ 156 9 α 63 3 κ 0 19 p 10 273 p 50 332 p 100 351 and p 1000 401 the value of ξ and p 10 are in similar zone see fig 4a d justifying its influence ξ on lower return period values however at a high return period the quantile suddenly falls in the lower range the corresponding κ is a positive value upper bounded condition signifying its substantial control over the quantile at a high return period see fig 4c g 4 2 covariate selection this section selects suitable covariates by carrying out regressions between gev parameters and potential covariates the aim is to find significant covariates which can be used in the ked system each parameter was regressed against the chosen covariates remotely sensed annual mean rainfall amr and annual mean monsoon rainfall ammr elevation elv distance from bay of bengal dbb distance from the himalayan regions dhr and geographical coordinates lat and lon table 1 shows the regression results for the gev parameters only the significant covariates are reported the significance level for this study is chosen to 5 ammr and dhr are identified as the significant covariates for ξ in case with α and κ elevation is the only significant covariate the r2 value 63 obtained for the location parameter can be considered reasonably good a lower value 11 is obtained for the scale parameter the regression of the shape parameter attained the lowest r2 9 which is expected from the higher uncertainty involved in its estimation the other candidates amr dbb lat and lon did not reveal any significant association with any gev parameters thus they are not taken into account further for ked analysis 4 3 semivariogram analysis variogram plays a pivotal role in presenting spatial variation of an interpolation variable a widely used variogram model namely the spherical model is used to fit the estimated empirical variogram in this study the analysis of variogram and subsequent kriging assessment were performed in r r core team 2017 the variograms including ok and ked cases are displayed in fig 5 for location parameter ξ the empirical and the corresponding fitted spherical semi variograms are shown in fig 5a d the same diagrams are displayed for α and κ respectively in fig 5e f and g h with regard to ok the spherical model is fitted to the empirical one quite well for the location and scale parameter the location parameter shows a linear trend suggesting its association with external variables which is proved in ked case regarding shape parameter a lack of spatial dependence is shown a high nugget effect suggests that the value fluctuates abruptly over short distances the variograms for ked schemes are also on display see fig 5b d f h variables that found significant were used in ked schemes the variograms are based on residuals originating from regression with the covariates this is appraised as the variation persisting after the local drift has been taken out sills of those variograms are expected to be smaller than those constructed for ok this aspect is quite obvious for location parameter as it can be seen from fig 5b d and table 2 the variograms for ked schemes ked ammr ked ammr dhr and ked dhr are able to reduce some sills considering that the covariates ammr and dhr are significantly correlated with the location parameter in contrast sills are barely reduced for scale and shape parameter see fig 5e g indicating they are not strongly correlated with the elevation see table 1 assessing the above variograms especially for the shape parameter the pure nugget could be a model option in which the sample mean is taken as the model value this consideration is quite common in spatial estimation das et al 2020b and in regional analysis das 2017 jin and stedinger 1989 this takes κ value to have 0 093 at ungauged locations in bangladesh which is unbounded and in principle appropriate for engineering applications based on the covariate and semi variogram analysis the spatial models compared for each parameter are listed in table 3 4 4 selection of best interpolation model this section presents the analysis to produce maps displaying the spatial distribution of parameters of the extreme value distribution the objective has been to construct spatial models for each gev parameter which in turn provides a spatial probability model when applied in composite manner the superior interpolation models are identified to produce spatial maps for each parameter fig 6 a d display maps for the location parameter generated by the ok ked ammr ked ammr dhr and ked dhr respectively fig 6e f display maps for the scale parameter produced by the ok and ked elv respectively while fig 6g h display the same for the shape parameter point estimates are used in the construction of maps thus interpolation techniques are responsible for varying nature of maps in an individual case the maps produced for location parameter show that the value is in general larger in the north and north east region and in the south along the coast and south east region near to the mountainous region lower values are especially recognized in the west and middle region which is quite distinct the spatial pattern of ξ mimics aptly the general pattern of the rainfall in the area a gradual trend from the west to the east see fig 1 maps generated by all the methods are quite smooth and the spatial distributions are fairly similar the maps by ked ammr and ked ammr dhr are rather complex showing the shape of ammr the maps produced for α to some degree give similar spatial patterns but the distinction in the middle areas is not that strong the ked elv model in addition induced a distinct area in the south east mountainous region due to its correlation with the elevation in contrast the distribution of κ is slightly different as shown in fig 6g h the ok model is quite uniform and the value is below zero in most of the cases presenting its non bounded form however with the ked elv model the influence of elevation is found in some areas of the south east mountainous region taking κ to positive values bounded condition in order to identify an appropriate model examining the spatial pattern is not enough a more objective namely the cross validation is required for the evaluation purpose two cases of cross validation were appraised which have been explained in sec 2 4 a summary of cross validation assessment based on 34 stations is given in table 4 the leave one out form of cross validation selects the ked with ammr as the best scheme for ξ with an rmse of 14 69 mm 10 93 and mae of 10 9 mm 8 11 with regard to α the ked scheme with elv was unable to score past the ok method the ok model is found superior with an rmse of 6 65 15 65 and mae of 4 97 11 71 the same ked scheme in shape parameter context was also compared against the ok and the constant mean cm model the cm model attained the highest error the other two give quite the same results in terms of rmse 0 12 and the difference is quite insignificant to be able to select the right one however with the ked scheme positive values were identified in some areas of the south east mountainous region which in turn give bounded conditions in extreme value estimates the situation is generally not recommended in practice thus the ok model is preferred a similar result was obtained when a data shortage case 5 fold cross validation is considered data scarcity does not affect the model selection hence the models identified are considered to be robust to some degree in the study area context 4 5 assessment of predicted quantile the availability of parameter maps allows the estimation of extreme rainfall at locations where rainfall records were absent fig 7 displays the spatial distribution of selected magnitude of 10 50 100 1000 year return period rainfall in general the greatest hazard or heaviest magnitude is expected along the coast in particular near the chittagong and in the north and north east area adjacent to the himalayan hindu kush region this can be explained by the influence of monsoon that generates from the south the lowest amount is expected in the western part and to some extent in the central areas these parts are isolated from the air masses originated from the bay of bengal they are also quite far from the mountainous region in the north the findings are supported by shahid and behrawan 2008 where they found that the level of aridity is quite high in this area a comparison is presented against the quantile value calculated using the observed at site data the selected spatial models are applied to predict parameters at gauging stations with the help of leave one out cross validation technique the parameters obtained are used to predict quantiles at the same gauged stations the residual errors are calculated by subtracting the predicted quantile value from the observed quantile estimated based on observed data a positive error is appraised under prediction the errors are used to construct bubble plots displaying the performance across the region the plots are produced for four cases 10 50 100 and 1000 year quantile they are shown in fig 8 in general errors increased as the return period increases overestimation is prominent in lower quantile case but as the return period increases the underestimation has more cases the reason is the shape parameter which influences the higher return period values there are several cases where high negative 0 2 values unbounded condition are noticed in observed data see 4c however in the model prediction the values in those cases are around 0 05 see fig 6g as a result the observed estimated values are greater than the model values higher errors in general are detected along the south east coast where highest rainfall occur the most other areas particularly the middle west mostly experience low to medium errors the quantile map produced by the parameter model is compared to the map produced based on quantile interpolation the quantile interpolation map is constructed using the at site estimate of quantile and the value is translated to the un sampled locations using the ok model see fig 9 the maps are quite comparable in low return period events see figs 9a and 7 the situation where the location parameter dominates however as the return period increases so as the dominance of shape parameter the map based on quantile interpolation falters and the distinction between the low and high value diminishes to null see fig 9d thus the spatial map based on quantile value should be avoided in practice 5 discussion the results clearly show that the information about monsoon rainfall and spatial data play a key role in the modeling of extreme rainfall which complement the previous studies das 2018 2017 on the behaviour of region s extreme rainfall the information about monsoon rainfall plays a critical role when the region of influence roi approach of regional analysis is used to delineate homogeneous groups in the estimation of extreme rainfall das 2017 spatial information is found significant when the growth factor of regional estimate is compared against the spatial interpolation das 2018 this study includes both the information diligently which is an improvement in the technical aspect in the form of model parameter interpolation as well the amalgamation of different information the study recognized that a strongly correlated variate such as ammr performed well in the ked analysis however a loosely correlated but significant covariate elevation did not perform significantly well in this regard a strongly correlated covariate hence has a greater chance to succeed with the ked method which in turn provides an efficient estimate therefore the search for effective covariates in scale and shape parameter context should be encouraged another crucial point of discussion is the modelling of shape parameter which is uncertain by nature the spatial modelling of shape parameter using the ok method sees an enhancement over considering a regional mean value the application of regional mean is quite common whether it is used in spatial estimation das et al 2020b or regional frequency analysis das 2017 jin and stedinger 1989 the shape parameter influences the most in high return level estimates e g p 100 which are often required in hydraulic designs the unbounded condition is not only desirable at present conditions but also in the backdrop of climate change as it permits the growth of magnitudes between high return periods bangladesh is listed as one of the highly vulnerable country to the impacts of climate change the occurrence of more intense and heavy extreme rainfall is expected under climate change shahid et al 2016 thus the modelling of shape parameter which gives the unbounded condition covers the climate change impact in the appropriate manner 6 conclusion this study deals with the issue of mapping the extreme rainfall by combining the extreme value modelling with the interpolation method the approach that permits parameters of an extreme value distribution to vary spatially is used to determine the probability model the methodology subsequently authorizes the frequency analysis to be performed at ungauged conditions the primary objective has been to determine robust spatial models for the parameters of an extreme value distribution which is suitable in bangladesh context attempts have been carried out to find suitable covariates that can be incorporated appropriately in the kriging system the covariates were chosen diligently to encapsulate physical characteristics that influence the extreme behaviour of rainfall in the study area this study primarily assessed ked interpolation technique which has the ability to include covariates the ok model was included to compare against the ked models the cross validation was implemented to find the pertinent scheme for each parameter annual maximum daily rainfall data from 34 measuring stations were used for the assessment the following conclusions are obtained from the study covariates that deemed suitable remotely sensed annual mean rainfall and annual mean monsoon rainfall ammr and others such as distance from the bay of bengal distance from the himalayan regions dhr and elevation were identified and their spatial coverage were derived for the study area the ammr and dhr are significantly correlated with the location parameter the elevation is found correlated with the other gev parameters scale and shape the ked appears to be the best model for location parameter the association of ammr with the model gives the best result the ok is identified as the superior model for scale parameter the model attained a lower error in comparison with the ked model the same model is also found suitable for the shape parameter which is regarded as an enhancement over considering a regional mean value the availability of parameter maps allows the estimation of extreme rainfall at locations where rainfall records were absent the greatest hazard or heaviest rainfall is expected along the coast and in the north and north east area adjacent to the himalayan hindu kush region the lowest amount is expected in the western part and to some extent in the central areas of bangladesh the residual error increases with the increase of return period overestimation is prominent in lower quantiles however in higher quantiles underestimations are noticed due to the effect of shape parameter the composite parameter based probability model offers an improved estimation when it compared with the traditional at site quantile based interpolation annual maximum series of 1 day rainfall is considered in this study other durations of rainfall extremes should be appraised in the future to see their performance in this condition overall the outcome is expected to help research communities to advance the related research and identify the corresponding covariates in different geographical and climatic conditions which will ultimately give an overall consensus about the extreme rainfall estimation at ungauged locations worldwide credit authorship contribution statement samiran das conceptualization data curation

4281,river flows are greatly influenced by floodplain vegetation with implications on hydrological and hydraulic conditions from cross sectional to river reach scales flow models need to reliably reflect changes in the riverine environment such as vegetation growth associated with altered flow regimes increased sediment loads and eutrophication leaf area index lai based approaches are increasingly used as tools to predict the flow resistance caused by natural vegetation however current lai based modelling involves uncertainty at low and high vegetation densities and flow velocities

pressure sensors to measure flow resistance and force sensors to measure plant drag forces flow resistance decreased by 35 90 when the submergence h h v increased from 1 to 2 which is a highly relevant range for floodplain flows the results provided new evidence that lai based modelling of vegetative friction factors can be reliably extended from low to high lai values for non submerged vegetation however adjustments to existing lai based approaches are required for water stages higher than the vegetation height furthermore the friction by the understory grasses cannot be neglected

roughness coefficients are varied according to water depth to dynamically take into account the changes in vegetative resistance caused by plant flexibility or changing flow stage or e g kiczko et al 2020 perret et al 2021 secondly it remains difficult to predict the vegetative flow resistance of natural floodplains typically growing a combination of diverse vegetation types such as shorter grasses and taller flexible bushes shrubs and trees antonarakis et al 2010 naiman and and décamps 1997 richardson et al 2007 this creates large variability in the vegetated characteristics to be addressed in modelling applications and produces uncertainty to models relying on the commonly adopted simplification of vegetation to rigid cylindrical elements baptist et al 2007 caroppi et al 2019

including flow resistance formulas of järvelä 2004 and västilä and järvelä 2014 various definitions of lai have been introduced for different purposes it is important that lai is precisely defined to

various destructive and non destructive methods such as ripping and measuring foliage area jalonen et al 2013 or remote sensing methods such as terrestrial and airborne laser scanning and image analysis e g antonarakis et al 2010 jalonen et al 2015 thus also allowing for a flow depth related definition of lai conventionally the drag force fd is defined as f d 0 5 ρ a c c d u m 2 where cd is the drag coefficient ρ the fluid density ac is the characteristic reference area and um the mean flow velocity to account for the non quadratic relationship with the velocity as a result of plant streamlining and reconfiguration e g de langre 2008 vogel 1994 the drag force equation can be modified to f tot 0 5 ρ a c c d χ u m 2 χ where cdχ is a species specific drag coefficient and χ the reconfiguration parameter jalonen et al 2013 järvelä 2004 vogel 1994 ftot scales with the velocity as u m 2 χ with the reconfiguration parameter χ describing the relationship between the drag force

2019 most of these models are not yet readily available for end users and lai based models of vegetative flow resistance have been developed and validated only under a limited range of conditions to address these shortcomings research is needed on the flow resistance of floodplain vegetation under a wide range of mean flow velocities densities and relative submergences of the vegetation h hv where h is the water depth and hv the undeflected height of the vegetation most research is focussed on the intermediate vegetation densities and velocity ranges huai et al 2014 järvelä 2004 wang and zhang 2019 for instance parameterizations developed for woody vegetation have been validated only at a limited range of vegetation densities and at emergent and just submerged conditions västilä and

floodplains such as the full range of to low and high plant densities and flow velocities 1 3 objectives the aim of this study was to improve understanding of vegetative flow resistance induced by a mixture of flexible terrestrial or riparian floodplain vegetation the specific objectives were to i determine the effect of lai on vegetated flow resistance for a mixture of grassy understory and flexible woody vegetation from low to high vegetation densities lai 1 5 experiments were designed to cover a wide range of mean flow velocities um 0 05 1 2 m s typical for wetland and river flows but the outer ranges area rarely translated to flume experiments ii investigate the need and possibilities for decomposing the total vegetative flow resistance into resistance by woody plants and understory grasses the analyses are based on individual drag force measurement and bulk flow resistance measurements iii explore the suitability of lai based flow resistance formulas for mixed floodplain vegetation at low relative submergence of h hv 1 2 with a view on practicability in hydrological and hydraulic modelling applications 2 methods section 2 1 introduces the experimental runs to investigate the relationships between the vegetative resistance flow velocity density and relative submergence section 2 2 describes the different types of vegetation used sections 2 3 and 2 4 cover the water level and force measurements that allowed for determining the drag and reconfiguration parameters and friction factors section 2 5 describes the three lai based resistance approaches tested 2 1 experimental runs and hydraulic conditions in total 80 experimental runs in the aalto environmental hydraulics flow channel were conducted to determine the vegetative resistance of a mixture of grasses and flexible woody foliated vegetation table 1 experiments a c and grasses d the lai range of the present study was considered representative of low to high vegetation densities in lowland rivers in continental and boreal climates fig 1 in the nature a wide range of vegetation densities are found from almost none existent up to lai values as high as 18 asner et al 2003 an lai of 1 5 as investigated in this study is common for vegetated floodplains but often not adequately reflected in modelling studies the glassed walled working section of the tilting flume was 16 m long 0 6 m wide and 0 8 m deep the downstream weir was used to control the water depth and all experimental runs were conducted with a horizontal bed slope for gradually varied flow two recirculation modes allowed for discharges up 300 l s the discharge was measured by electromagnetic flowmeters 0 5 accuracy ten pressure sensors tapped at the centreline of the bed were used to measure the water depths and surface slope all data were recorded with a 20 hz frequency by two national instruments data acquisition systems integrated and processed into an in house developed labview program 2 2 vegetation properties a 5 5 m long reach of vegetation with 3 cm tall grasses and 20 cm tall flexible woody plants was installed in the flow channel the woody plants were placed in a staggered pattern of equal longitudinal sx 12 5 cm and lateral spacing sy 12 5 fig 2 the spacing was selected based on similar experiments with natural like vegetation and natural floodplain conditions caroppi et al 2019 jalonen et al 2013 järvelä 2004 2002 västilä et al 2013 the relatively dense plant spacing limited the formation of preferential flow paths and addresses the concerns raised in the literature järvelä 2002 the artificial plants were selected based on their biomechanical properties such as the flexibility and roughness and showed similar reconfiguration behaviour as natural floodplain plants caroppi et al 2019 the plants were on average 20 cm tall and had a stem diameter of 4 mm corresponding to a projected stem area as of 7 3 cm2 the number of stems and leaves were adapted for each density condition see table 1 resulting in plants with a one sided leaf area al of 150 450 and 700 cm2 for the lai 1 4 3 8 and 5 2 setups respectively the stems were bundled together using a 3d printed connection piece this method was chosen to simulate natural like thickets of bushy plants rather than producing a uniform distribution at a smaller spacing as commonly done in other studies e g västilä et al 2013 the leaf to stem area ratio al as ranged between 21 and 31 in all setups the stem area was low compared to the leaf area 3 5 the total one sided leaf areas per unit volume al 6 5 to 24 8 m 1 table 1 were relatively large compared to the use of rigid cylinder as vegetation surrogates a 0 24 4 m 1 huai et al 2014 rahimi et al 2020 the vertical density distribution was modified to reproduce vertical velocity profiles typical of natural floodplain conditions and the attained velocity profiles were similar to the reported profiles in the literature e g rahimi et al 2020 tang 2019 the understory grasses were glued on the bed of the flume and had a density of approximately 4000 stems per m2 and a one sided area per unit volume ag of 56 m 1 2 3 mean flow resistance measurements a novel setup of ten pressure sensors were used to measure the water levels along the streamwise direction of the vegetated reach fig 3 which allowed to compute the friction losses by the vegetation all runs were conducted under gradually varied flow conditions the water level differences between upstream and downstream cross sections were measured by a differential pressure sensor 0 1 accuracy and two absolute pressure sensors 0 1 accuracy fs eight additional pressure sensors 1 accuracy fs were used to monitor the water surface slope after steady conditions were reached water level measurements of a two minute period were taken the time averaged values were used in further computations and analyses the friction losses hf were computed following the bernoulli s equation h f z up h up α u m 2 up 2 g z down h down α u m 2 down 2 g hup and hdown are the water depths and zup and zup are the flume bed elevation for the upstream and downstream location respectively α is the velocity distribution coefficient α 1 herein and g is the gravitational acceleration the bulk vegetative friction factors f of the mixture of vegetation were calculated as f 8gh um 2 hf dx järvelä 2002 where dx is the length between the upstream and downstream measured cross sections the friction of the understory grasses f were estimated from a separate set of experiments with the grasses only d runs table 1 the measured friction factors of the bed with the understory grasses f are converted to manning s n n f 8 g h 1 3 and chézy coefficient cb c b 8 g f to ease comparisons with literature limitations in the pressure sensor accuracy caused minor uncertainties in the estimates of f especially at low mean flow velocities and large water depths a maximum cb value of 50 m1 2 s was used in the comparisons as higher values were considered unrealistic separate measurements of the flow resistance by the foliated woody vegetation and understory grasses allowed for determining the friction by the understory grasses f and foliated plants f the friction factors of the foliated woody plants f were computed by subtracting f from the bulk friction f f f f assuming linear superposition principle västilä and järvelä 2014 yen 2002 data from experimental runs with very low friction losses hf 1 mm was excluded from the analyses as these measurements were prone to large uncertainties resulting from limitations in the measurement accuracy the uncertainty of measured hf was largest for combinations of low um um 0 2 m s low lai and relatively high water depths 2 4 drag force measurements drag forces ftot n were measured by a 3 n force sensor 0 025 accuracy fs for single plants of different thicket structure fig 2b placed on the centreline of the flume in the absence of other plants the force measurements were conducted under just submerged conditions over a wide range of mean flow velocities um 0 1 0 8 m s this allowed for determining the parameters drag and reconfiguration coefficients of the tested lai based approaches see section 2 5 the voltage v output of the force sensor was scaled following a linear relationship obtained from a calibration curve specifically prepared for this case with very high linearity r2 0 99 the signal was integrated and processed in the labview program 2 5 lai based vegetative flow resistance formulae for the present study three resistance formulae utilizing the leaf area index lai as a key input parameter were selected for detailed investigations the approach by järvelä 2004 referred to as jar the approach by västilä and järvelä västilä and järvelä 2014 referred to as vas and the approach by baptist et al 2007 that was modified by dalledonne et al 2019 referred to as bap modlai the methods were tested for accuracy and limitations under a setting of mixed vegetation at low relative submergences the three lai based formulae were assessed by comparing the model results with the independent data of experimental runs a c table 1 the jar approach by järvelä 2004 was developed for just submerged woody foliated vegetation with the darcy weisbach friction factor f jar defined as 1 f jar 4 c d χ l a i u m u χ χ where uχ is the reference velocity for dimensional homogeneity defined as the lowest flow velocity used in determining χ herein uχ 0 2 m s lai is defined herein as the total one sided leaf area al of the plants per bed area ab lai al ab the vas approach by västilä and järvelä 2014 was developed to take into account the seasonal changes in foliage and the differences in the flexibility between the woody plant parts and leaves the approach is applicable for emergent and just submerged woody vegetation the total vegetative friction f vas by the woody vegetation is expressed as a sum of the friction due to the foliage and stem as f f f f s 2 f vas 4 a b a l c d χ f u m u χ f χ f a s c d χ s u m u χ s χ s where al is the one sided leaf area and as the total projected stem area cdχ f is the foliage drag coefficient corresponding to the characteristic reference velocity uχ f and χf is the foliage reconfiguration parameter cdχ s is the stem drag coefficient corresponding to the characteristic reference velocity uχ s and χs is the stem reconfiguration parameter the stem and foliage drag coefficients and reconfiguration parameters needed in applying eqs 3 and 4 were derived from the drag force data of the single plants see section 2 4 as in västilä and järvelä 2014 västilä and järvelä 2018 by converting eqs 3 and 4 into drag force i e f tot 0 5 ρ c d χ f u m u χ f χ f a l c d χ s u m u χ s χ s a s u m 2 and using the least square error method the stem parameters cdχ s and χs were fitted from the drag force data of leafless plants subsequently the cdχ f and χf values foliage only were fitted from the data of foliated plants stems leaves and using cdχ s and χs derived with the leafless plants the reference velocity of 0 2 m s uχ in jar and uχ s and uχ f in vas was used in the computations when applying the jar and vas approaches to predict f we used the parameter values obtained as average over the three plants of different density with cdχ 0 4 and χ 0 9 for jar and cdχ s 1 4 and cdχ f 0 4 along with χs 0 25 and χf 1 2 for vas the approach by baptist et al 2007 was developed for submerged vegetation with the vegetative term accounting for the friction by the mixture of the vegetation and the logarithmic term accounting for the effect of relative submergence assuming a logarithmic velocity profile above the vegetation the approach assumed that vegetation acts like an array of rigid cylinders with uniform properties the vegetative drag term md h v in the baptist et al 2007 model was substituted with ½ l a i and the total chézy friction factor cmodlai was computed analogously to folke et al 2019a 2019b 3 c m o d l a i 1 1 c b 2 1 2 l a i c d 2 g g κ l n h h v where cb the chézy coefficient of the bottom cd the drag coefficient κ is the von karman constant hv the undeflected height of the vegetation and h the water depth as in baptist et al 2007 we assumed cd 1 eq 3 is based on the relationship between the vegetation density diameter and spacing and lai as d δ 2 1 2 l a i h v raupach et al 1991 shields et al 2017 where δ is the unit bed area for a plant with longitudinal and lateral distances of sx and sy respectively this relationship assumes that leaves and stems are isotropically oriented and can be described with the same drag coefficient herein we acknowledge that the relationship between d δ 2 and lai is likely more complex because of reconfiguration as shown by independent experimental data in västilä et al 2013 to be directly comparable to the vas and jar approaches eq 3 was converted to the total darcy weisbach friction using the standard definition of f 8 g c 2 4 f m o d l a i 8 g 1 c b 2 1 2 l a i c d 2 g 0 5 g κ l n h h v 2 we used cb c b 8 g f derived from the experimental runs d with the bottom grasses only table 1 separately for each case of relative submergence and mean flow velocity the friction by the understory grasses f was measured directly from the water surface slope and computed as f 8 g h u m 2 h f d x where hf are the friction losses and dx the longitudinal distance f modlai was obtained by subtracting f from f we compared the friction factors generated by the foliated vegetation f modelled by the jar vas and bap modlai approaches against the experimentally derived values see section 2 3 of the runs a c the measured f was obtained from the total resistance f after subtracting the resistance by the bottom grasses f for each combination of mean flow velocity density and relative submergence section 2 3 3 results section 3 1 addresses objective 1 section 3 2 objective 2 and sections 3 3 and 3 4 objective 3 3 1 mean flow resistance of the mixture of vegetation the darcy weisbach friction factors scaled with the lai of the mixtures of vegetation are shown as a function of um in fig 5 a the vegetative friction decreased non linearly with increasing um for all tested conditions the decrease of f with um collapses together reasonably well for each examined relative submergence when normalized with lai the spread in f lai between the different vegetation densities within each investigated relative submergence is largest at the low flow velocities um 0 05 0 1 m s the observed patterns correspond well to observations made in the literature for just submerged flexible vegetation jalonen and järvelä 2014 järvelä 2004 2002 in cases of the vegetation mixtures with submergence of h hv 2 the decrease of f with um is flattened and does not show a typical exponential decrease but a closer to linear dependency the f lai relationship is shown in fig 5b c for four mean flow velocities um 0 1 0 3 0 6 and 0 8 m s as expected f scales about linearly with lai over the full range of vegetation densities and mean flow velocities a given increase in lai increases f notably more at low um with leaves and plants reconfiguring only slightly by contrast the reconfiguration decreases the influence of lai increase on f more strongly at higher mean flow velocities the ratio of the friction factors between h hv 2 and h hv 1 is shown in fig 6 for identical mean flow velocities between the two submergences for um ranging between 0 05 and 0 6 m s depending on mean flow velocity an increase in h hv from 1 to 2 resulted in a 30 to 92 decrease in friction factor the f ratio increased linearly for low to high bulk flow velocities changes in lai did not notably affect the f ratios as indicated by the minor spread between the different vegetation densities these results indicate that the relative submergence affects f independent of lai however in case of lai 1 4 the f ratio deviates slightly from the linear f ratio um relationship at low um um 0 2 m s this deviation was likely caused by a decreased reduction of the vegetative drag for lower density vegetation as result of high flow penetration into the vegetated part 3 2 decomposing total resistance into resistance by woody vegetation and understory grasses the friction by the understory grasses was determined from separate friction tests set d table 1 to provide insight into the resistance by the woody vegetation f and by the bottom grasses f the friction by the understory grasses f is shown in fig 7 for increasing um at the two relative submergences of the grasses h hg 6 and 12 where hg is the height of the grasses the friction factor by the grasses ranged between 0 15 and 0 38 n 0 032 0 057 for the investigated combinations of mean flow velocity and relative submergence the friction by the understory grasses f increased with um for both relative submergences while the increase was larger for lower h hg doubling the water depth reduced the friction by the understory grasses to 38 55 depending on mean flow velocity the reduction in f by doubling the water depth was larger for higher mean flow velocity see fig 7 for example f was 1 5 times larger for um of 0 6 m s compared to an um of 0 2 m s the ratio of the friction by the understory grasses to the total friction of the vegetation mixture f f is shown in fig 8 f f ranged between 2 and 28 and increased for increasing mean flow velocity for all conditions while the relative submergence primarily affected the observed relationships for just submerged conditions at low um the reconfiguration of the plants was practically negligible with low f f indication higher shares of the resistance generated by the foliated plants in comparison at higher um the woody plants showed significant reconfiguration with a larger share of the friction generated by the understory grasses at submerged conditions h hv 1 the effect of the reconfiguration was less pronounced as f f was smaller 3 3 plant drag force and species averaged drag and reconfiguration parameters for vas and jar models the total measured drag forces ftot on the single plants of increasing density or thicket appearance corresponding to the lai 1 4 3 8 and 5 2 setups are shown in fig 9 b for a wide range of mean flow velocities um 0 1 0 85 m s in the case of the leafless plants fs increased exponentially with increasing mean flow velocity at low um and linearly at intermediate to high um fig 9a the increase in fs with um follows the quadratic drag force equation fd um 2 reasonably well r2 0 93 0 99 for most conditions for the foliated plants the increase of ftot with um showed a linear pattern at the low mean flow velocities fig 9b this can be explained by the reconfiguration of the leaves also at low um the contribution of the drag by the leaves to the total drag ffol ftot decreased with increasing flow velocity due to the reconfiguration of the foliage ffol ftot ranged between 97 and 63 considering the velocity range of um 0 1 to 0 85 m s the relatively large contribution of the friction by the leaves to the total plant drag originates from the relatively large leaf to stem area ratios used in this study al as ranged between 21 and 31 the contribution of the drag by leaves to the total drag ffol ftot depends strongly on um which agrees with the literature aberle and järvelä 2013 västilä and järvelä 2014 generally a plant with lower leaf area is more effective in terms of resistance compared to a plant with high leaf area vogel 1994 however sheltering effect of other leaves is more pronounced for plants of larger one sided leaf areas and may compensate for some of the increased leaf area the species averaged drag coefficient cdχ and reconfiguration parameter χ eq 1 were on average cdχ 0 4 and χ 0 9 respectively minor differences were observed in cdχ and χ between the plants cdχ ranged between 0 38 and 0 51 for the single stem plants and plants with three stems this can be explained by the increase of the effective stem diameter that includes the stem and space between the individual stems which caused resulted in larger cdχ for plants with multiple stems the plants consisting of a single stem and low one sided leaf area al 150 cm2 had a significantly lower reconfiguration parameter χ χ 0 7 compared to the plants with multiple stems and higher al χ 0 9 to 1 2 the variation in cdχ and χ is larger for plants with low leaf to stem area ratios al as 30 because cdχ and χ are strongly depended on the leaf to stem area ratios västilä and järvelä 2014 the averaged drag and reconfiguration coefficients of the stems and foliage eq 2 were cdχ s 1 5 cdχ f 0 4 and χs 0 25 and χf 1 2 respectively cdχ s and cdχ f ranged at 1 2 1 8 and 0 38 0 5 respectively between the plants containing a single stem and multiple stems the stem and foliation reconfiguration parameter χs ranged at 0 2 0 25 and χf at 1 1 1 2 the variation in χs and χf was minimal for the different plants overall the values correspond well to values derived for natural species västilä and järvelä 2018 2014 with exception of cdχ f which was twice as high compared to the natural average the relatively high cdχ and cdχ f of the plants used is likely the result of the less streamlined shape of the leaves more rigid leaves and petiole in comparison to their natural counterparts 3 4 lai based modelling of the bulk vegetative resistance the flow resistance of the woody vegetation f modelled by jar eq 1 järvelä 2004 vas eq 2 västilä and järvelä 2018 and bap modlai eq 4 baptist et al 2007 folke et al 2019a 2019b approaches are plotted against the measured f values in fig 10 a for just submerged vegetation h hv 1 this allows for exploring the suitability of the selected lai based approaches to predict f for over a wide range of lai and um under just submerged conditions the vas and jar models predicted f reasonably well while the bap modlai had a notably weaker performance fig 10a b the root mean square errors rmse were 5 3 3 2 and 2 0 and the and nash sutcliffe efficiencies nse were 0 31 0 74 and 0 90 for the bap modlai jar and vas models respectively for vas and jar models the relative differences between measured and modelled f were reasonably low for most datapoints and ranged from 45 to 14 for bap modlai the differences between measured and modelled f ranged between 75 to 78 the underprediction by vas and jar models at high resistances i e at low velocities fig 10b were likely caused by the higher drag or less efficient reconfiguration of the plant stands compared to the single plants used for deriving the parameter values the bap modlai approach overpredicted the resistance at f 7 while at higher resistances f was underpredicted fig 10c and 10d show the bap modlai modelling results for submerged conditions h hv 2 the jar and vas models were not applied to submerged conditions as they were developed for just submerged or emergent conditions the rmse and nse were 1 1 and 1 1 respectively while the relative differences ranged from 2 to 70 with larger errors obtained with increasing f this non linear deviation indicated that bap modlai approach was unsuitable to predict f for a mixture of flexible foliated vegetation at submerged conditions this can be explained by the fact that the logarithmic term in eq 4 does not account for the vegetative reconfiguration with increasing mean flow velocity at low relative submergences 4 discussion the increasing interest in river and water management towards nature based solutions incorporating vegetation e g rowiński et al 2018 necessitates an improved understanding of flow processes on vegetated floodplains and wetlands vegetated flows are characterised by a wide range of velocities e g 0 02 0 4 m s in wetlands stern et al 2001 and with reported velocities up to 2 m s for river floodplains folke et al 2019b the results of this study are useful for the understanding of flows on such vegetated floodplains and wetlands the surrounding land use often limits the maximum allowable water levels so that vegetation needs to be maintained to control the vegetative flow resistance removal of vegetation is often restricted to minimize risk damaging the ecosystem to maintain the stability of the floodplain and other regulations natural growth of the vegetation in combination with maintenance typically lead to flow modelling scenarios with low to high densities and low relative submergences as investigated in this study fig 1 4 1 dependency of the bulk vegetative flow resistance on flow velocity lai and relative submergence adding up to the existing literature the new results in this study indicate that also under low relative submergence the vegetative resistance is strongly influenced by the mean flow velocity and vegetation density aberle and järvelä 2013 freeman et al 2000 järvelä 2004 2002 schoneboom et al 2010 västilä and järvelä 2014 the present study focused on the less researched range of just submerged to low submerged vegetation whereas many others focus on emergent or just submerged vegetation västilä and järvelä 2018 2014 however floodplain flow conditions with low relative submergence of the riparian zone are common for moderate to large flood events therefore new insights on the vegetative resistance of flexible floodplain vegetation at submerged conditions are considered valuable for increased understanding at the investigated range the results indicated that relative submergence was a key factor in the prediction of the resistance for example neglecting the effects of increasing relative submergence at the investigated range h hv 1 2 will result in overestimation of the vegetative resistance up to 65 depending on mean flow velocity and vegetation density see fig 6 in this study the vegetative resistance decreased more rapidly at low mean flow velocity compared to high flow velocity see fig 5 as a result of the reconfiguration of the vegetation the effect of the relative submergence on the f um and f lai relationships results from the fact that part of the flow is conveyed above vegetation and thus not subjected to vegetative flow resistance which decreases the total flow resistance according to the momentum balance e g luhar and nepf 2013 the observed f lai h hv dependencies see fig 5 can be extended to other scenarios of comparable foliated woody vegetation this may be useful e g in the design and management of vegetated channels in the case when lai can be estimated but available resources restrain a more detailed analysis or if only a rough approximation of the flow resistance is required from the practical viewpoint the influence of vegetation density and flow velocity on f are substantially lower at h hv 2 compared to just submerged conditions fig 4 therefore if lai is unknown but falls within the presently examined range of lai 1 5 the presented f h hv relationships fig 5c can be useful for flow resistance estimates in practical cases with h hv 2 at h hv 2 the effect of lai and um on the f h hv relationship is expected to be less significant due to the diminished contribution of the vegetative flow area to the total flow area as more of the flow is conveyed above the vegetation these results suggest that for combining the environmental and technical viewpoints it is preferable to maintain the vegetation so that the relative submergence would be around h hv 2 at flood conditions this would lead to a notable decrease in water levels and improvement in flow conveyance compared to emergent or just submerged vegetation while preventing the need for ecologically harmful full cut e g bączyk et al 2018 the obtained f lai h hv relationships may slightly overestimate the flow resistance for natural vegetation which has more flexible leaves and petioles than the present artificial plants see section 3 3 further uncertainty is introduced by the fact that the vegetation type structure leaf to stem area ratio vertical drag density distribution and turbulence are expected to influence the f h hv relationships okamoto et al 2016 siniscalchi and nikora 2013 västilä and järvelä 2014 4 2 need for decomposing the total friction into resistance by woody vegetation and understory grasses the results on the measured f and f are used to discuss the need for decomposing the resistance f into f and f the friction by the grasses increased for increasing flow velocity and decreased for increasing relative submergence this can be explained by that the understory grasses acted as a permeable wall where the momentum penetration within the bed increases with increasing velocity which is equivalent to an increase in the effective bottom roughness as previously observed manes et al 2012 the ratio of the friction by the understory grasses to the total friction ranged between 2 and 28 which is in line with values reported in the literature of experiments with flexible vegetation e g 5 25 in schoneboom et al 2010 the relative submergence strongly affected this ratio and is an important factor to be considered in estimates of the flow resistance by the understory grasses this is especially true in the case of field studies where the friction by the understory contributes a relatively large share of the total friction berends et al 2020 schoneboom et al 2010 in the case of high plant densities the friction by the understory grasses can be neglected whereas in other cases e g berends et al 2020 huthoff et al 2007 including this study the friction by the understory grasses should be included in the total resistance for example berends et al 2020 found that the roughness was 38 higher in the case with understory vegetation in comparison to without understory in practise the understory grasses can be included in the estimate of bulk resistance as an additional resistance term or be incorporated by adjusting the lai estimate in field observations with remote sensing methods the lai of the understory is commonly part of the total lai i e as bulk lai e g jalonen et al 2013 in the present study the bulk lai was 3 1 5 5 and 7 corresponding to the lai 1 4 3 8 and 5 2 condition respectively including the lai of the understory into the bulk lai would result in an increase of 25 to 54 compared to lai of the woody plants incorporating the understory grasses as an explicit roughness term such as f or cb into existing resistance equations requires further experimentation focusing on the validity of the linear superposition assumption between the two vegetative terms i e f and f 4 3 modelling of the bulk vegetative resistance by lai based approaches model predictions on river flows in both hydrologic and hydraulic contexts need to reflect reliably changes in the environment e g vegetation growth due to altered flow regimes changes in climatic conditions and increased sediment and nutrient loads as a part of the solution improved tools and parameterizations are necessary to incorporate the effect of natural floodplain vegetation in investigating river and floodplain flows herein leaf area index lai is a promising measure widely used in a broad range of models in earth sciences though not yet fully exploited in fluvial hydrologic and hydraulic analyses therefore three lai based models jar vas and bap modlai were tested with the data obtained in this study to validate their use under a wide range of lai and mean flow velocities the use of lai in modelling vegetative friction proved to be advantageous compared to the use of conventional parameters i e stem density porosity used in other studies particularly when considering large scale estimates of the vegetative resistance and in absence of field data wang zhang 2019 noted that if field data on vegetation are not available the method of järvelä 2004 that uses the lai data from remote sensing is a feasible option to compute dynamic resistance factors the separate consideration of foliage and stem as in vas approach is useful when the stem notably contributes to the resistance or when al as changes through foliation and leaf shedding or through aging of the plants see discussion in västilä and järvelä 2014 the same equations and parameter values are applicable in different foliation conditions and can be used for modelling flow depth dependent resistance below and above a canopy layer politti 2017 despite having more parameters process based methods are superior to non dynamical resistance factors when applied to vegetative conditions they were developed for kiczko et al 2020 an alternative approach is to treat vegetation characteristics such as lai i e al ab and as ab as parameters that can be identified through the inverse problem if a few data points of the stage discharge relationship are available for a specific river section or floodplain kiczko et al 2020 for example kiczko et al kiczko et al 2020 successfully predicted the flow resistance of a vegetated compound channel at high floodplain water levels using the vas model västilä and järvelä 2018 2014 with the parameter values derived for low floodplain flows in cases of non submerged vegetation overall good similarity between modelled and measured f values were obtained with the vas eq 2 västilä and järvelä 2018 and jar eq 1 järvelä 2004 models whereas the bap modlai eq 4 baptist et al 2007 folke et al 2019a 2019b provided notably weaker predictions the jar and vas approaches resulted in reliable estimates of the vegetative drag from low to high lai 1 5 and al 6 5 24 8 particularly at medium to high flow velocities provided that the drag and reconfiguration parameters are available their applicability to lower submergences of h hv 0 3 1 0 has been demonstrated by västilä et al 2013 the parameter values are available for several typical riparian species and genera while the species averaged parameter values are recommended for a mixture of species västilä and järvelä 2018 these vegetative drag parameterizations are physically solid and easy to implement in numerical models in terms of fd f n cda or cdah as necessary for different use cases based on the equation presented by västilä and järvelä 2018 our results suggest that it is possible to apply parameters derived with single plants to reach scale with plant stand of varying density we acknowledge that mutual interactions between the plants are dependent on plant spacing and density tanino and nepf 2008 but based on our results fig 5 the influence of mutual interaction was small and did not hinder the application of the lai based models the less reliable performance of the bap modlai model is mainly explained by the fact that it does not account for reconfiguration which substantially influences the flow resistance reconfiguration of the plants and leaves result in changes in the vegetation height and large changes in the drag density parameter cda at submerged conditions of h hv 2 the bap modlai approach was found unsuitable to predict f reliably for flexible vegetation despite the logarithmic term included in eq 4 to account for the relative submergence of the vegetation to arrive at a generally applicable approach for woody vegetation from emergent to high relative submergence the vas and jar models should be developed to include the f h hv dependency a straightforward alternative is to replace the c d m d h v or ½ l a i c d term of the bap modlai approach by the parameterization of cdah derived from eq 2 västilä and järvelä 2018 that accounts for reconfiguration induced changes in drag a further benefit of this modification is that it eliminates the need for the assumption of roughness density or frontal area index equalling half the lai in eq 4 according to raupach et al 1991 and folke et al 2019a folke et al 2019b 5 conclusions improved modelling tools are necessary to describe the flow resistance effect of complex natural floodplain vegetation mixtures on river flows in the present study the new experimental setup with a mixture of flexible vegetation types and a set of high accuracy pressure and force sensors proved to be suitable for determining the darcy weisbach friction factors f for low and high vegetation densities over a wide range of mean flow velocities at low relative submergences h hv 1 2 the results provided new evidence that leaf area index lai based resistance modelling is reliable for non submerged vegetation with a low to high lai so far there has been uncertainty in cases with lai outside the medium range the relative submergence strongly affected f which showed a decrease of 35 90 when the submergence h hv increased from 1 to 2 which is a highly relevant range for riverbank and floodplain flows the effect of the relative submergence on the flow resistance was strongly dependent on the mean flow velocity with the largest decrease in f for the lowest mean flow velocity in contrast to practises reported in the literature the flow resistance f by the understory grasses up to 28 of the total resistance in this study should be included explicitly to avoid significant errors in the total f estimates out of the three lai based models tested for non submerged conditions the jar järvelä 2004 and vas västilä and järvelä 2014 models performed notably better than the bap modlai modified from baptist et al 2007 by folke et al 2019a the vas and jar models performed favourably particularly at medium to high velocities typical for flood flows where the influence of plant reconfiguration led to decreasing f with increasing velocity the vas model resulted in the highest similarity between measured and modelled f and was considered well suited to predict f for seasonally varying mixtures of floodplain vegetation for conditions with submerged vegetation the models require adjustments before they can be used reliably this calls for further detailed investigations and model developments on flow resistance of natural

4281,river flows are greatly influenced by floodplain vegetation with implications on hydrological and hydraulic conditions from cross sectional to river reach scales flow models need to reliably reflect changes in the riverine environment such as vegetation growth associated with altered flow regimes increased sediment loads and eutrophication leaf area index lai based approaches are increasingly used as tools to predict the flow resistance caused by natural vegetation however current lai based modelling involves uncertainty at low and high vegetation densities and flow velocities

understory grasses of low to high densities lai 1 5 over a wide range of mean flow velocities 0 05 1 2 m s at low relative submergences of 1 2 a novel flume setup was designed by using high accuracy pressure sensors to measure flow resistance and force sensors to measure plant drag forces flow resistance decreased by 35 90 when the submergence h h v increased from 1 to 2 which is a highly relevant range for floodplain flows the results provided new evidence that lai based modelling of vegetative friction factors can be reliably extended from low to high lai values for non submerged vegetation however adjustments to existing lai based approaches are required for water stages higher than the vegetation height furthermore the friction by the understory grasses cannot be neglected

grasses and taller flexible bushes shrubs and trees antonarakis et al 2010 naiman and and décamps 1997 richardson et al 2007 this creates large variability in the vegetated characteristics to be addressed in modelling applications and produces uncertainty to models relying on the commonly adopted simplification of vegetation to rigid cylindrical elements baptist et al 2007 caroppi et al 2019

including flow resistance formulas of järvelä 2004 and västilä and järvelä 2014 various definitions of lai have been introduced for different purposes it is important that lai is precisely defined to

various destructive and non destructive methods such as ripping and measuring foliage area jalonen et al 2013 or remote sensing methods such as terrestrial and airborne laser scanning and image

2019 most of these models are not yet readily available for end users and lai based models of vegetative flow resistance have been developed and validated only under a limited range of conditions to address these shortcomings research is needed on the flow resistance of floodplain vegetation under a wide range of mean flow velocities densities and relative submergences of the vegetation h hv where h is the water depth and hv the undeflected height of the vegetation most research is focussed on the intermediate vegetation densities and velocity ranges huai et al 2014 järvelä 2004 wang and

mixture of flexible terrestrial or riparian floodplain vegetation the specific objectives were to i determine the effect of lai on vegetated flow resistance for a mixture of grassy understory and flexible woody vegetation from low to high vegetation densities lai 1 5 experiments were designed to cover a wide range of mean flow velocities um 0 05 1 2 m s typical for wetland and river flows but the outer ranges area rarely translated to flume experiments ii investigate the need and possibilities for decomposing the total vegetative flow resistance into resistance by woody plants and understory grasses the analyses are based on individual drag force measurement and bulk flow resistance measurements iii explore the suitability of lai based flow resistance formulas for mixed floodplain vegetation at low relative submergence of h hv 1 2 with a view on practicability in hydrological and hydraulic modelling applications 2 methods section 2 1 introduces the experimental runs

cover the water level and force measurements that allowed for determining the drag and reconfiguration parameters and friction factors section 2 5 describes the three lai based resistance approaches tested 2 1 experimental runs and hydraulic conditions in total 80 experimental runs in the aalto environmental hydraulics flow channel were conducted to determine the vegetative resistance of a mixture of grasses and flexible woody foliated vegetation table 1 experiments a c and grasses d the lai range of the present study was considered representative of low to high vegetation densities in lowland rivers in continental and boreal climates fig 1 in the nature a wide range of vegetation densities are found from almost none existent up to lai values as high as 18 asner et al 2003 an lai of 1 5 as investigated in this study is common for vegetated floodplains but often not adequately reflected in modelling studies the glassed walled working section of the tilting flume was 16 m long 0 6 m wide and 0 8 m deep the downstream weir was used to control the water depth and all experimental runs were conducted with a horizontal bed slope for gradually varied flow two recirculation modes allowed for discharges up 300 l s the discharge was measured by electromagnetic flowmeters 0 5 accuracy ten pressure sensors tapped at the centreline of the bed were used to measure the water depths and surface slope all data were recorded with a 20 hz frequency by two national instruments data acquisition systems integrated and processed into an in house developed labview program 2 2 vegetation properties a 5 5 m long reach of vegetation with 3 cm tall grasses and 20 cm tall flexible woody plants was installed in the flow channel the woody plants were placed in a staggered pattern of equal longitudinal sx 12 5 cm and lateral spacing sy 12 5 fig 2 the spacing was selected based on similar experiments with natural like vegetation and natural floodplain conditions caroppi et al 2019 jalonen et al 2013 järvelä 2004 2002 västilä et al 2013 the relatively dense plant spacing limited the formation of preferential flow paths and addresses the concerns raised in the literature järvelä 2002 the artificial plants were selected based on their biomechanical properties such as the flexibility and roughness and showed similar reconfiguration behaviour as natural floodplain plants caroppi et al 2019 the plants were on average 20 cm tall and had a stem diameter of 4 mm corresponding to a projected stem area as of 7 3 cm2 the number of stems and leaves were adapted for each density condition see table 1 resulting in plants with a one sided leaf area al of 150 450 and 700 cm2 for the lai 1 4 3 8 and 5 2 setups respectively the stems were bundled together using a 3d printed connection piece this method was chosen to simulate natural like thickets of bushy plants rather than producing a uniform distribution at a smaller spacing as commonly done in other studies e g västilä et al 2013 the leaf to stem area ratio al as ranged between 21 and 31 in all setups the stem area was low compared to the leaf area 3 5 the total one sided leaf areas per unit volume al 6 5 to 24 8 m 1 table 1 were relatively large compared to the use of rigid cylinder as vegetation surrogates a 0 24 4 m 1 huai et al 2014 rahimi et al 2020 the vertical density distribution was modified to reproduce vertical velocity profiles typical of natural floodplain conditions and the attained velocity profiles were similar to the reported profiles in the literature e g rahimi et al 2020 tang 2019 the understory grasses were glued on the bed of the flume and had a density of approximately 4000 stems per m2 and a one sided area per unit volume ag of 56 m 1 2 3 mean flow resistance measurements a novel setup of ten pressure sensors were used to measure the water levels along the streamwise direction of the vegetated reach fig 3 which allowed to compute the friction losses by the vegetation all runs were conducted under gradually varied flow conditions the water level differences between upstream and downstream cross sections were measured by a differential pressure sensor 0 1 accuracy and two absolute pressure sensors 0 1 accuracy fs eight additional pressure sensors 1 accuracy fs were used to monitor the water surface slope after steady conditions were reached water level measurements of a two minute period were taken the time averaged values were used in further computations and analyses the friction losses hf were computed following the bernoulli s equation h f z up h up α u m 2 up 2 g z down h down α u m 2 down 2 g hup and hdown are the water depths and zup and zup are the flume bed elevation for the upstream and downstream location respectively α is the velocity distribution coefficient α 1 herein and g is the gravitational acceleration the bulk vegetative friction factors f of the mixture of vegetation were calculated as f 8gh um 2 hf dx järvelä 2002 where dx is the length between the upstream and downstream measured cross sections the friction of the understory grasses f were estimated from a separate set of experiments with the grasses only d runs table 1 the measured friction factors of the bed with the understory grasses f are converted to manning s n n f 8 g h 1 3 and chézy coefficient cb c b 8 g f to ease comparisons with literature limitations in the pressure sensor accuracy caused minor uncertainties in the estimates of f especially at low mean flow velocities and large water depths a maximum cb value of 50 m1 2 s was used in the comparisons as higher values were considered unrealistic separate measurements of the flow resistance by the foliated woody vegetation and understory grasses allowed for determining the friction by the understory grasses f and foliated plants f the friction factors of the foliated woody plants f were computed by subtracting f from the bulk friction f f f f assuming linear superposition principle västilä and järvelä 2014 yen 2002 data from experimental runs with very low friction losses hf 1 mm was excluded from the analyses as these measurements were prone to large uncertainties resulting from limitations in the measurement accuracy the uncertainty of measured hf was largest for combinations of low um um 0 2 m s low lai and relatively high water depths 2 4 drag force measurements drag forces ftot n were measured by a 3 n force sensor 0 025 accuracy fs for single plants of different thicket structure fig 2b placed on the centreline of the flume in the absence of other plants the force measurements were conducted under just submerged conditions over a wide range of mean flow velocities um 0 1 0 8 m s this allowed for determining the parameters drag and reconfiguration coefficients of the tested lai based approaches see section 2 5 the voltage v output of the force sensor was scaled following a linear relationship obtained from a calibration curve specifically prepared for this case with very high linearity r2 0 99 the signal was integrated and processed in the labview program 2 5 lai based vegetative flow resistance formulae for the present study three resistance formulae utilizing the leaf area index lai as a key input parameter were selected for detailed investigations the approach by järvelä 2004 referred to as jar the approach by västilä and järvelä västilä and järvelä 2014 referred to as vas and the approach by baptist et al 2007 that was modified by dalledonne et al 2019 referred to as bap modlai the methods were tested for accuracy and limitations under a setting of mixed vegetation at low relative submergences the three lai based formulae were assessed by comparing the model results with the independent data of experimental runs a c table 1 the jar approach by järvelä 2004 was developed for just submerged woody foliated vegetation with the darcy weisbach friction factor f jar defined as 1 f jar 4 c d χ l a i u m u χ χ where uχ is the reference velocity for dimensional homogeneity defined as the lowest flow velocity used in determining χ herein uχ 0 2 m s lai is defined herein as the total one sided leaf area al of the plants per bed area ab lai al ab the vas approach by västilä and järvelä 2014 was developed to take into account the seasonal changes in foliage and the differences in the flexibility between the woody plant parts and leaves the approach is applicable for emergent and just submerged woody vegetation the total vegetative friction f vas by the woody vegetation is expressed as a sum of the friction due to the foliage and stem as f f f f s 2 f vas 4 a b a l c d χ f u m u χ f χ f a s c d χ s u m u χ s χ s where al is the one sided leaf area and as the total projected stem area cdχ f is the foliage drag coefficient corresponding to the characteristic reference velocity uχ f and χf is the foliage reconfiguration parameter cdχ s is the stem drag coefficient corresponding to the characteristic reference velocity uχ s and χs is the stem reconfiguration parameter the stem and foliage drag coefficients and reconfiguration parameters needed in applying eqs 3 and 4 were derived from the drag force data of the single plants see section 2 4 as in västilä and järvelä 2014 västilä and järvelä 2018 by converting eqs 3 and 4 into drag force i e f tot 0 5 ρ c d χ f u m u χ f χ f a l c d χ s u m u χ s χ s a s u m 2 and using the least square error method the stem parameters cdχ s and χs were fitted from the drag force data of leafless plants subsequently the cdχ f and χf values foliage only were fitted from the data of foliated plants stems leaves and using cdχ s and χs derived with the leafless plants the reference velocity of 0 2 m s uχ in jar and uχ s and uχ f in vas was used in the computations when applying the jar and vas approaches to predict f we used the parameter values obtained as average over the three plants of different density with cdχ 0 4 and χ 0 9 for jar and cdχ s 1 4 and cdχ f 0 4 along with χs 0 25 and χf 1 2 for vas the approach by baptist et al 2007 was developed for submerged vegetation with the vegetative term accounting for the friction by the mixture of the vegetation and the logarithmic term accounting for the effect of relative submergence assuming a logarithmic velocity profile above the vegetation the approach assumed that vegetation acts like an array of rigid cylinders with uniform properties the vegetative drag term md h v in the baptist et al 2007 model was substituted with ½ l a i and the total chézy friction factor cmodlai was computed analogously to folke et al 2019a 2019b 3 c m o d l a i 1 1 c b 2 1 2 l a i c d 2 g g κ l n h h v where cb the chézy coefficient of the bottom cd the drag coefficient κ is the von karman constant hv the undeflected height of the vegetation and h the water depth as in baptist et al 2007 we assumed cd 1 eq 3 is based on the relationship between the vegetation density diameter and spacing and lai as d δ 2 1 2 l a i h v raupach et al 1991 shields et al 2017 where δ is the unit bed area for a plant with longitudinal and lateral distances of sx and sy respectively this relationship assumes that leaves and stems are isotropically oriented and can be described with the same drag coefficient herein we acknowledge that the relationship between d δ 2 and lai is likely more complex because of reconfiguration as shown by independent experimental data in västilä et al 2013 to be directly comparable to the vas and jar approaches eq 3 was converted to the total darcy weisbach friction using the standard definition of f 8 g c 2 4 f m o d l a i 8 g 1 c b 2 1 2 l a i c d 2 g 0 5 g κ l n h h v 2 we used cb c b 8 g f derived from the experimental runs d with the bottom grasses only table 1 separately for each case of relative submergence and mean flow velocity the friction by the understory grasses f was measured directly from the water surface slope and computed as f 8 g h u m 2 h f d x where hf are the friction losses and dx the longitudinal distance f modlai was obtained by subtracting f from f we compared the friction factors generated by the foliated vegetation f modelled by the jar vas and bap modlai approaches against the experimentally derived values see section 2 3 of the runs a c the measured f was obtained from the total resistance f after subtracting the resistance by the bottom grasses f for each combination of mean flow velocity density and relative submergence section 2 3 3 results section 3 1 addresses objective 1 section 3 2 objective 2 and sections 3 3 and 3 4 objective 3 3 1 mean flow resistance of the mixture of vegetation the darcy weisbach friction factors scaled with the lai of the mixtures of vegetation are shown as a function of um in fig 5 a the vegetative friction decreased non linearly with increasing um for all tested conditions the decrease of f with um collapses together reasonably well for each examined relative submergence when normalized with lai the spread in f lai between the different vegetation densities within each investigated relative submergence is largest at the low flow velocities um 0 05 0 1 m s the observed patterns correspond well to observations made in the literature for just submerged flexible vegetation jalonen and järvelä 2014 järvelä 2004 2002 in cases of the vegetation mixtures with submergence of h hv 2 the decrease of f with um is flattened and does not show a typical exponential decrease but a closer to linear dependency the f lai relationship is shown in fig 5b c for four mean flow velocities um 0 1 0 3 0 6 and 0 8 m s as expected f scales about linearly with lai over the full range of vegetation densities and mean flow velocities a given increase in lai increases f notably more at low um with leaves and plants reconfiguring only slightly by contrast the reconfiguration decreases the influence of lai increase on f more strongly at higher mean flow velocities the ratio of the friction factors between h hv 2 and h hv 1 is shown in fig 6 for identical mean flow velocities between the two submergences for um ranging between 0 05 and 0 6 m s depending on mean flow velocity an increase in h hv from 1 to 2 resulted in a 30 to 92 decrease in friction factor the f ratio increased linearly for low to high bulk flow velocities changes in lai did not notably affect the f ratios as indicated by the minor spread between the different vegetation densities these results indicate that the relative submergence affects f independent of lai however in case of lai 1 4 the f ratio deviates slightly from the linear f ratio um relationship at low um um 0 2 m s this deviation was likely caused by a decreased reduction of the vegetative drag for lower density vegetation as result of high flow penetration into the vegetated part 3 2 decomposing total resistance into resistance by woody vegetation and understory grasses the friction by the understory grasses was determined from separate friction tests set d table 1 to provide insight into the resistance by the woody vegetation f and by the bottom grasses f the friction by the understory grasses f is shown in fig 7 for increasing um at the two relative submergences of the grasses h hg 6 and 12 where hg is the height of the grasses the friction factor by the grasses ranged between 0 15 and 0 38 n 0 032 0 057 for the investigated combinations of mean flow velocity and relative submergence the friction by the understory grasses f increased with um for both relative submergences while the increase was larger for lower h hg doubling the water depth reduced the friction by the understory grasses to 38 55 depending on mean flow velocity the reduction in f by doubling the water depth was larger for higher mean flow velocity see fig 7 for example f was 1 5 times larger for um of 0 6 m s compared to an um of 0 2 m s the ratio of the friction by the understory grasses to the total friction of the vegetation mixture f f is shown in fig 8 f f ranged between 2 and 28 and increased for increasing mean flow velocity for all conditions while the relative submergence primarily affected the observed relationships for just submerged conditions at low um the reconfiguration of the plants was practically negligible with low f f indication higher shares of the resistance generated by the foliated plants in comparison at higher um the woody plants showed significant reconfiguration with a larger share of the friction generated by the understory grasses at submerged conditions h hv 1 the effect of the reconfiguration was less pronounced as f f was smaller 3 3 plant drag force and species averaged drag and reconfiguration parameters for vas and jar models the total measured drag forces ftot on the single plants of increasing density or thicket appearance corresponding to the lai 1 4 3 8 and 5 2 setups are shown in fig 9 b for a wide range of mean flow velocities um 0 1 0 85 m s in the case of the leafless plants fs increased exponentially with increasing mean flow velocity at low um and linearly at intermediate to high um fig 9a the increase in fs with um follows the quadratic drag force equation fd um 2 reasonably well r2 0 93 0 99 for most conditions for the foliated plants the increase of ftot with um showed a linear pattern at the low mean flow velocities fig 9b this can be explained by the reconfiguration of the leaves also at low um the contribution of the drag by the leaves to the total drag ffol ftot decreased with increasing flow velocity due to the reconfiguration of the foliage ffol ftot ranged between 97 and 63 considering the velocity range of um 0 1 to 0 85 m s the relatively large contribution of the friction by the leaves to the total plant drag originates from the relatively large leaf to stem area ratios used in this study al as ranged between 21 and 31 the contribution of the drag by leaves to the total drag ffol ftot depends strongly on um which agrees with the literature aberle and järvelä 2013 västilä and järvelä 2014 generally a plant with lower leaf area is more effective in terms of resistance compared to a plant with high leaf area vogel 1994 however sheltering effect of other leaves is more pronounced for plants of larger one sided leaf areas and may compensate for some of the increased leaf area the species averaged drag coefficient cdχ and reconfiguration parameter χ eq 1 were on average cdχ 0 4 and χ 0 9 respectively minor differences were observed in cdχ and χ between the plants cdχ ranged between 0 38 and 0 51 for the single stem plants and plants with three stems this can be explained by the increase of the effective stem diameter that includes the stem and space between the individual stems which caused resulted in larger cdχ for plants with multiple stems the plants consisting of a single stem and low one sided leaf area al 150 cm2 had a significantly lower reconfiguration parameter χ χ 0 7 compared to the plants with multiple stems and higher al χ 0 9 to 1 2 the variation in cdχ and χ is larger for plants with low leaf to stem area ratios al as 30 because cdχ and χ are strongly depended on the leaf to stem area ratios västilä and järvelä 2014 the averaged drag and reconfiguration coefficients of the stems and foliage eq 2 were cdχ s 1 5 cdχ f 0 4 and χs 0 25 and χf 1 2 respectively cdχ s and cdχ f ranged at 1 2 1 8 and 0 38 0 5 respectively between the plants containing a single stem and multiple stems the stem and foliation reconfiguration parameter χs ranged at 0 2 0 25 and χf at 1 1 1 2 the variation in χs and χf was minimal for the different plants overall the values correspond well to values derived for natural species västilä and järvelä 2018 2014 with exception of cdχ f which was twice as high compared to the natural average the relatively high cdχ and cdχ f of the plants used is likely the result of the less streamlined shape of the leaves more rigid leaves and petiole in comparison to their natural counterparts 3 4 lai based modelling of the bulk vegetative resistance the flow resistance of the woody vegetation f modelled by jar eq 1 järvelä 2004 vas eq 2 västilä and järvelä 2018 and bap modlai eq 4 baptist et al 2007 folke et al 2019a 2019b approaches are plotted against the measured f values in fig 10 a for just submerged vegetation h hv 1 this allows for exploring the suitability of the selected lai based approaches to predict f for over a wide range of lai and um under just submerged conditions the vas and jar models predicted f reasonably well while the bap modlai had a notably weaker performance fig 10a b the root mean square errors rmse were 5 3 3 2 and 2 0 and the and nash sutcliffe efficiencies nse were 0 31 0 74 and 0 90 for the bap modlai jar and vas models respectively for vas and jar models the relative differences between measured and modelled f were reasonably low for most datapoints and ranged from 45 to 14 for bap modlai the differences between measured and modelled f ranged between 75 to 78 the underprediction by vas and jar models at high resistances i e at low velocities fig 10b were likely caused by the higher drag or less efficient reconfiguration of the plant stands compared to the single plants used for deriving the parameter values the bap modlai approach overpredicted the resistance at f 7 while at higher resistances f was underpredicted fig 10c and 10d show the bap modlai modelling results for submerged conditions h hv 2 the jar and vas models were not applied to submerged conditions as they were developed for just submerged or emergent conditions the rmse and nse were 1 1 and 1 1 respectively while the relative differences ranged from 2 to 70 with larger errors obtained with increasing f this non linear deviation indicated that bap modlai approach was unsuitable to predict f for a mixture of flexible foliated vegetation at submerged conditions this can be explained by the fact that the logarithmic term in eq 4 does not account for the vegetative reconfiguration with increasing mean flow velocity at low relative submergences 4 discussion the increasing interest in river and water management towards nature based solutions incorporating vegetation e g rowiński et al 2018 necessitates an improved understanding of flow processes on vegetated floodplains and wetlands vegetated flows are characterised by a wide range of velocities e g 0 02 0 4 m s in wetlands stern et al 2001 and with reported velocities up to 2 m s for river floodplains folke et al 2019b the results of this study are useful for the understanding of flows on such vegetated floodplains and wetlands the surrounding land use often limits the maximum allowable water levels so that vegetation needs to be maintained to control the vegetative flow resistance removal of vegetation is often restricted to minimize risk damaging the ecosystem to maintain the stability of the floodplain and other regulations natural growth of the vegetation in combination with maintenance typically lead to flow modelling scenarios with low to high densities and low relative submergences as investigated in this study fig 1 4 1 dependency of the bulk vegetative flow resistance on flow velocity lai and relative submergence adding up to the existing literature the new results in this study indicate that also under low relative submergence the vegetative resistance is strongly influenced by the mean flow velocity and vegetation density aberle and järvelä 2013 freeman et al 2000 järvelä 2004 2002 schoneboom et al 2010 västilä and järvelä 2014 the present study focused on the less researched range of just submerged to low submerged vegetation whereas many others focus on emergent or just submerged vegetation västilä and järvelä 2018 2014 however floodplain flow conditions with low relative submergence of the riparian zone are common for moderate to large flood events therefore new insights on the vegetative resistance of flexible floodplain vegetation at submerged conditions are considered valuable for increased understanding at the investigated range the results indicated that relative submergence was a key factor in the prediction of the resistance for example neglecting the effects of increasing relative submergence at the investigated range h hv 1 2 will result in overestimation of the vegetative resistance up to 65 depending on mean flow velocity and vegetation density see fig 6 in this study the vegetative resistance decreased more rapidly at low mean flow velocity compared to high flow velocity see fig 5 as a result of the reconfiguration of the vegetation the effect of the relative submergence on the f um and f lai relationships results from the fact that part of the flow is conveyed above vegetation and thus not subjected to vegetative flow resistance which decreases the total flow resistance according to the momentum balance e g luhar and nepf 2013 the observed f lai h hv dependencies see fig 5 can be extended to other scenarios of comparable foliated woody vegetation this may be useful e g in the design and management of vegetated channels in the case when lai can be estimated but available resources restrain a more detailed analysis or if only a rough approximation of the flow resistance is required from the practical viewpoint the influence of vegetation density and flow velocity on f are substantially lower at h hv 2 compared to just submerged conditions fig 4 therefore if lai is unknown but falls within the presently examined range of lai 1 5 the presented f h hv relationships fig 5c can be useful for flow resistance estimates in practical cases with h hv 2 at h hv 2 the effect of lai and um on the f h hv relationship is expected to be less significant due to the diminished contribution of the vegetative flow area to the total flow area as more of the flow is conveyed above the vegetation these results suggest that for combining the environmental and technical viewpoints it is preferable to maintain the vegetation so that the relative submergence would be around h hv 2 at flood conditions this would lead to a notable decrease in water levels and improvement in flow conveyance compared to emergent or just submerged vegetation while preventing the need for ecologically harmful full cut e g bączyk et al 2018 the obtained f lai h hv relationships may slightly overestimate the flow resistance for natural vegetation which has more flexible leaves and petioles than the present artificial plants see section 3 3 further uncertainty is introduced by the fact that the vegetation type structure leaf to stem area ratio vertical drag density distribution and turbulence are expected to influence the f h hv relationships okamoto et al 2016 siniscalchi and nikora 2013 västilä and järvelä 2014 4 2 need for decomposing the total friction into resistance by woody vegetation and understory grasses the results on the measured f and f are used to discuss the need for decomposing the resistance f into f and f the friction by the grasses increased for increasing flow velocity and decreased for increasing relative submergence this can be explained by that the understory grasses acted as a permeable wall where the momentum penetration within the bed increases with increasing velocity which is equivalent to an increase in the effective bottom roughness as previously observed manes et al 2012 the ratio of the friction by the understory grasses to the total friction ranged between 2 and 28 which is in line with values reported in the literature of experiments with flexible vegetation e g 5 25 in schoneboom et al 2010 the relative submergence strongly affected this ratio and is an important factor to be considered in estimates of the flow resistance by the understory grasses this is especially true in the case of field studies where the friction by the understory contributes a relatively large share of the total friction berends et al 2020 schoneboom et al 2010 in the case of high plant densities the friction by the understory grasses can be neglected whereas in other cases e g berends et al 2020 huthoff et al 2007 including this study the friction by the understory grasses should be included in the total resistance for example berends et al 2020 found that the roughness was 38 higher in the case with understory vegetation in comparison to without understory in practise the understory grasses can be included in the estimate of bulk resistance as an additional resistance term or be incorporated by adjusting the lai estimate in field observations with remote sensing methods the lai of the understory is commonly part of the total lai i e as bulk lai e g jalonen et al 2013 in the present study the bulk lai was 3 1 5 5 and 7 corresponding to the lai 1 4 3 8 and 5 2 condition respectively including the lai of the understory into the bulk lai would result in an increase of 25 to 54 compared to lai of the woody plants incorporating the understory grasses as an explicit roughness term such as f or cb into existing resistance equations requires further experimentation focusing on the validity of the linear superposition assumption between the two vegetative terms i e f and f 4 3 modelling of the bulk vegetative resistance by lai based approaches model predictions on river flows in both hydrologic and hydraulic contexts need to reflect reliably changes in the environment e g vegetation growth due to altered flow regimes changes in climatic conditions and increased sediment and nutrient loads as a part of the solution improved tools and parameterizations are necessary to incorporate the effect of natural floodplain vegetation in investigating river and floodplain flows herein leaf area index lai is a promising measure widely used in a broad range of models in earth sciences though not yet fully exploited in fluvial hydrologic and hydraulic analyses therefore three lai based models jar vas and bap modlai were tested with the data obtained in this study to validate their use under a wide range of lai and mean flow velocities the use of lai in modelling vegetative friction proved to be advantageous compared to the use of conventional parameters i e stem density porosity used in other studies particularly when considering large scale estimates of the vegetative resistance and in absence of field data wang zhang 2019 noted that if field data on vegetation are not available the method of järvelä 2004 that uses the lai data from remote sensing is a feasible option to compute dynamic resistance factors the separate consideration of foliage and stem as in vas approach is useful when the stem notably contributes to the resistance or when al as changes through foliation and leaf shedding or through aging of the plants see discussion in västilä and järvelä 2014 the same equations and parameter values are applicable in different foliation conditions and can be used for modelling flow depth dependent resistance below and above a canopy layer politti 2017 despite having more parameters process based methods are superior to non dynamical resistance factors when applied to vegetative conditions they were developed for kiczko et al 2020 an alternative approach is to treat vegetation characteristics such as lai i e al ab and as ab as parameters that can be identified through the inverse problem if a few data points of the stage discharge relationship are available for a specific river section or floodplain kiczko et al 2020 for example kiczko et al kiczko et al 2020 successfully predicted the flow resistance of a vegetated compound channel at high floodplain water levels using the vas model västilä and järvelä 2018 2014 with the parameter values derived for low floodplain flows in cases of non submerged vegetation overall good similarity between modelled and measured f values were obtained with the vas eq 2 västilä and järvelä 2018 and jar eq 1 järvelä 2004 models whereas the bap modlai eq 4 baptist et al 2007 folke et al 2019a 2019b provided notably weaker predictions the jar and vas approaches resulted in reliable estimates of the vegetative drag from low to high lai 1 5 and al 6 5 24 8 particularly at medium to high flow velocities provided that the drag and reconfiguration parameters are available their applicability to lower submergences of h hv 0 3 1 0 has been demonstrated by västilä et al 2013 the parameter values are available for several typical riparian species and genera while the species averaged parameter values are recommended for a mixture of species västilä and järvelä 2018 these vegetative drag parameterizations are physically solid and easy to implement in numerical models in terms of fd f n cda or cdah as necessary for different use cases based on the equation presented by västilä and järvelä 2018 our results suggest that it is possible to apply parameters derived with single plants to reach scale with plant stand of varying density we acknowledge that mutual interactions between the plants are dependent on plant spacing and density tanino and nepf 2008 but based on our results fig 5 the influence of mutual interaction was small and did not hinder the application of the lai based models the less reliable performance of the bap modlai model is mainly explained by the fact that it does not account for reconfiguration which substantially influences the flow resistance reconfiguration of the plants and leaves result in changes in the vegetation height and large changes in the drag density parameter cda at submerged conditions of h hv 2 the bap modlai approach was found unsuitable to predict f reliably for flexible vegetation despite the logarithmic term included in eq 4 to account for the relative submergence of the vegetation to arrive at a generally applicable approach for woody vegetation from emergent to high relative submergence the vas and jar models should be developed to include the f h hv dependency a straightforward alternative is to replace the c d m d h v or ½ l a i c d term of the bap modlai approach by the parameterization of cdah derived from eq 2 västilä and järvelä 2018 that accounts for reconfiguration induced changes in drag a further benefit of this modification is that it eliminates the need for the assumption of roughness density or frontal area index equalling half the lai in eq 4 according to raupach et al 1991 and folke et al 2019a folke et al 2019b 5 conclusions improved modelling tools are necessary to describe the flow resistance effect of complex natural floodplain vegetation mixtures on river flows in the present study the new experimental setup with a mixture of flexible vegetation types and a set of high accuracy pressure and force sensors proved to be suitable for determining the darcy weisbach friction factors f for low and high vegetation densities over a wide range of mean flow velocities at low relative submergences h hv 1 2 the results provided new evidence that leaf area index lai based resistance modelling is reliable for non submerged vegetation with a low to high lai so far there has been uncertainty in cases with lai outside the medium range the relative submergence strongly affected f which showed a decrease of 35 90 when the submergence h hv increased from 1 to 2 which is a highly relevant range for riverbank and floodplain flows the effect of the relative submergence on the flow resistance was strongly dependent on the mean flow velocity with the largest decrease in f for the lowest mean flow velocity in contrast to practises reported in the literature the flow resistance f by the understory grasses up to 28 of the total resistance in this study should be included explicitly to avoid significant errors in the total f estimates out of the three lai based models tested for non submerged conditions the jar järvelä 2004 and vas västilä and järvelä 2014 models performed notably better than the bap modlai modified from baptist et al 2007 by folke et al 2019a the vas and jar models performed favourably particularly at medium to high velocities typical for flood flows where the influence of plant reconfiguration led to decreasing f with increasing velocity the vas model resulted in the highest similarity between measured and modelled f and was considered well suited to predict f for seasonally varying mixtures of floodplain vegetation for conditions with submerged vegetation the models require adjustments before they can be used reliably this calls for further detailed investigations and model developments on flow resistance of natural

4282,understanding the influence of climate change cc on groundwater recharge gwr is fundamental for a better long term planning and management of groundwater supply to date several regional research studies have been conducted to quantify climate induced factors on gwr however no study has summarised such recent modelling efforts to provide a global picture of projected changes in groundwater recharge over the long term in this research peer review articles related to cc gwr over the last 10 years were critically identified appraised and analysed the analysis focused on identifying the sources of uncertainty considered in such studies the modelling approaches adopted and finally the gwr projections results show a predominant use of process based models also only 20 of studies considered inter model uncertainty 11 considered emission scenario uncertainty and no studies considered intra model uncertainty a decrease in gwr for north africa southern europe and latin america regions was consistently projected oceania north america europe and asia had varying projections depending on emission scenario and season importantly overall a decline in gwr in most regions of the world can be expected though often the modelling was not supported by comprehensive quantification of uncertainty these findings can serve decision makers and researchers to develop sustainable plans to preserve this resource for future generations keywords groundwater recharge uncertainty climate change projections 1 introduction groundwater is a critical source of freshwater that meets the demand of a large portion of the earth s population industries and eco systems döll 2009 okkonen et al 2010 in 2014 the amount of global freshwater withdrawal was estimated to be about 4 trillion m3 ritchie and roser 2017 crucially there are many semi arid to arid regions such as the middle east africa mena region with limited surface water chambel 2015 jakeman et al 2016 which rely heavily on groundwater for their freshwater needs in africa drought and over exploitation were found to be the main causes of groundwater depletion between 2003 and 2009 equivalent to approximately 143 6 km3 which is comparable to the volume of the dead sea i e 147 km3 voss et al 2013 such climate and anthropogenic issues hinder a sustainable groundwater management moving forward leading to the deterioration in water quality and decreasing water levels groundwater recharge gwr is one of the main determining factors for the sustainability and hydrological balance of subsurface regimes döll and fiedler 2008 thampi and raneesh 2012 gwr is the amount of water percolating to a certain area into aquifers from the ground surface after rain or the infiltration underneath the neighbouring water bodies such as lakes and ponds gwr is controlled in part by atmospheric processes such as precipitation and evaporation and consequently any changes in the global climate can have a significant influence on groundwater in terms of its quality and quantity chambel 2015 sowers et al 2011 thus understanding the spatio temporal processes of recharge rates is paramount for groundwater management and sustainability smerdon 2017 gwr is difficult to be measured on site anderson et al 2015a alternative indirect methods can be used such as process based and empirical models however this leads to the introduction of further sources of uncertainty while quantifying the effects of climate change cc on gwr as stated in the fifth assessment report ar5 from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc projections indicate that cc will be the main stressor impacting on future surface and groundwater resources field et al 2014 it is therefore important to assess and quantify the current and future influences on groundwater resources based on different climatic conditions whilst the number of studies was somewhat limited before 2007 a noticeable increase can be seen after that field et al 2014 with the release of the ipcc fourth assessment report however despite the high numbers of recent studies the influence of future climate change on gwr remains largely uncertain mustafa et al 2019 future cc projections of gwr are subject to a wide range of sources of uncertainty including hydrological model surface or groundwater selection akbarpour and niksokhan 2018 hashemi et al 2015 her et al 2019 and development toure et al 2016 as well as the inherent uncertainty in ensemble general circulation models gcms and assumed emissions scenarios clilverd et al 2011 yidana et al 2019 additionally the uncertainty in future projections of recharge rates originating from hydrological models has not been sufficiently studied her et al 2019 finally the uncertainty arising from model conceptualisation and withdrawal scenarios has not been fully investigated yet mustafa et al 2019 a number of research studies have been undertaken including a review by smerdon 2017 which included a synopsis of six publications on cc and groundwater in the united states of america usa only i e regional scale smerdon 2017 summarized future cc impacts on gwr and sources of uncertainty related to gw modelling without any details about gw modelling approaches simulation approaches types of climate models periods of simulation and gwr projections under different emission scenarios further meixner et al 2016 completed a regional scale study in western usa regarding the potential impacts on recharge due to climate change such former efforts focus on a regional area on a global level mohan et al 2018 worked on 715 different sites worldwide and a gwr map was generated with values ranging between 0 and 1375 mm yr showing arid regions in australia middle east and sahara receiving the least value of recharge 1 mm yr this study however contained only general overviews about groundwater resources and no future gwr values were estimated a few review papers at the global scale exist e g earman and dettinger 2011 green et al 2011 holman et al 2012 however they are almost 10 years old at the time of writing and they served as a general review about groundwater resources with a limited focus on gwr consequently this paper provides a systematic literature review slr of studies into future projections of gwr from the past 10 years the paper is structured as follows the remainder of section 1

change in the state of earth s climate over decades or centuries it also refers to alterations in natural and anthropogenic activities on world s energy balance arneth et al 2019 examples of such changes include rise in sea level ice sheets and glaciers melting depletion of ozone o3 layer changes in precipitation patterns and air temperature field and barros 2014 the ipcc fifth assessment report indicated that cc can affect gwr in many ways responses might vary between increasing and decreasing changes in rainfall patterns and drought events and frequency are the main features of impact further rise in temperature leads to increase evaporation and then less groundwater replenishment occurs also higher evaporation was synchronised with anthropogenic effects e g water pumping can affect the quantity and quality e g increasing salinity of groundwater ipcc 2014a 2 research methods 2 1 literature search scope the literature review search was limited to the web of science and scopus databases and the search keywords were groundwater and recharge and climate change only studies published from january 2010 to december 2020 were considered due to the prevalence of studies after 2010 based on search keywords and criteria the number of studies before 2010 from both database sources was less than 20 the search was limited to english language publications from peer reviewed journals conference proceedings or grey literature were not considered 2 2 screening and eligibility criteria the initial search returned 56 papers from scopus and 63 papers from web of science yielding a total of 83 papers after the elimination of duplicates next the following screening and elimination criteria were applied fig 1 the first criterion was by title next the abstract and full text were evaluated based on two standards the research paper should include sufficient information about gwr modelling i e type of model type of data length of study period and boundary conditions and or future prediction of gwr in relation to cc and uncertainty the research paper should not include qualitative only approaches 2 3 content classification the final 73 papers were divided into two groups based on the presence of gwr predictions the 54 papers which included gwr predictions were further classified based on the following the geographical location of the study site the groundwater modelling approach for projected observations on gwr the application of sensitivity analysis in conjunction with the sources of uncertainty and also the climate models used table s1 includes specific information regarding the resulting publications specifically the citation details the geographic location baseline values of gwr the projected observation on gwr and the adopted groundwater modelling approach studies were also analysed in terms of uncertainty consideration table s2 provides metadata of previously adopted climate models reference details baseline periods simulation periods verification metrics and validation calibration periods both tables s1 and s2 can be found in the supplementary material sm 2 4 additional search criteria due to lack of global studies related to the aforementioned search criteria other criteria were also adopted to include papers with information about global gwr modelling e g modelling type and database time period and or gwr projections under cc the defined search keywords were climate change and groundwater and recharge for in this case both paper title and abstract from the same database sources scopus and web of science the outcome was 5 additional research papers 3 results and analysis in this section the literature review is discussed in the context of three main topics 1 modelling approaches 2 projected changes in gwr and 3 uncertainty sources 3 1 publication counts and study areas fig 2 shows the annual publication counts separated based on modelling methodology with total number of publications ranging from 4 to 6 per year with the exception of 2018 which yielded 15 papers most studies were performed in europe 19 research papers 26 7 after europe both north america and asia accounted for 18 articles each africa 10 articles oceania 5 articles and latin america 3 papers recorded a lower number of studies as shown infig 3 3 2 modelling approaches in relation to gwr projection modelling three methods have been utilised to quantify gwr and or evaluate the impact of cc on it these are 1 lumped water balance models 2 distributed process based models and 3 data driven models the results were classified into two categories namely those with gwr projections and without lumped water balance models only consider mass conservation and consider the aquifer as a black box where gwr can be simulated as a simple function of other parameters anderson et al 2015b on the other hand a distributed process based model can consider the spatial distribution and fluxes movement of the aquifer and also deal with different levels of complexity conversely the main principle of data driven models is to find relationships and correlations between available data for system variables for a certain location among the 55 papers considering future projections simulation scenarios lumped water balance models or distributed process based models were applied in the most cases 90 9 whilst 9 1 of the papers applied data driven models with respect to overall gwr modelling papers 66 articles 92 used a wide range of process based models specifically 18 papers used lumped water balance models e g el asri et al 2019 and the rest adopted distributed process based models such as help rivard et al 2014 modflow hashemi et al 2015 or wetspass hamdi et al 2020 3 2 1 lumped water balance models these models are simple and consider the gw aquifer as a whole as the spatial variations are not accounted simple water balance was found to be the most commonly used methodology 18 papers 27 7 water balance is one of the older well known approaches used for gwr computation it is a simplified approach that grants modellers a comprehensive overview of water systems for a specific region it consists of a formula where water balance is estimated based on the amount of incoming and outgoing water from a groundwater system under steady state conditions bredehoeft et al 1982 one of the main weaknesses is to consider change in water storage to be negligible further extreme events such as long term drought might hinder the hydrological equilibrium of the aquifer system in turn inaccurate results of gwr may occur bredehoeft et al 1982 table s3 shows specific information regarding model selection and limitations for each study generally simple water balance was selected due to a lower data requirement allowing gwr to be estimated even in cases of lack of hydro geology data when the study area covers complex geology formation 3 2 2 distributed process based models distributed process based d pb models can be broadly defined as mathematical normally computer based models that deal with spatio temporal variations and complexity of groundwater systems this modelling approach was extensively applied in the 10 year period of our review different types of groundwater d pb models exist and pros and cons are summarised in table 1 more information on such modelling approach and applications in the reviewed papers can be found in sm 3 2 3 data driven models data driven models are built based on the empirical site specific relationships between groundwater system variables kenda et al 2018 five papers applied such empirical approach for gwr simulations crosbie et al 2010 2012 2013a pulido velazquez et al 2015 rodriguez huerta et al 2019 both crosbie et al 2010 and crosbie et al 2012 chose the murray darling basin mdb in australia to evaluate the effect of cc on gwr crosbie et al 2010 created a power regression formula between annual gwr and annual rainfall to run scenarios for different soil types and other climatic parameters a simple empirical formula was drawn between the variations in gwr and in precipitation to run future scenarios in crosbie et al 2012 crosbie et al 2013a adopted crosbie et al 2010 equation but their study targeted the whole australia pulido velazquez et al 2015 ran different scenarios to calculate gwr using a non linear regression formula for runoff as daily rainfall was the input of this model rodríguez huerta et al 2019 used a complex formula between gwr and aquifer discharge as the discharge referred to water consumption 3 3 cc and hydrogeology regimes interactions understanding the current and future interconnection between cc and surface subsurface systems is vital for groundwater management to avoid issues such as aquifers depletion due to over pumping and consumption and salt water leakage langridge and fencl 2020 the main components of a hydrogeological system include precipitation both snow and rainfall snow melting evapotranspiration base flow soil moisture and temperature and the aquifer system those components can be easily affected by global changes in climate natural variability and anthropogenic factors green et al 2011 the spatio temporal changes of the climate can influence the timing quantity and distribution of gwr and hence groundwater storage cuthbert et al 2019 sensitivity of aquifers to cc is found to be higher in shallow aquifers than deep aquifers especially when they are under stress barron et al 2011 specific examples are provided in section 03 3 1 projected changes in hydrogeological parameters and gwr the impact of cc on the sustainability of groundwater resources is challenging and it is complex to provide comprehensive practical management strategies kiparsky et al 2017 further the projected values of gwr are still influenced by the inherent uncertainty of the future climate forecasting particularly long term time horizon projections recently a significant number of studies have been conducted to investigate those changes and to determine the main climate indicators affecting gwr projections for better future understanding the subsequent sections present the results of projected changes in gwr and their correlation with changing in hydrological factors 3 3 1 projected changes in hydrogeological parameters and gwr one of the fey factors controlling gwr is precipitation while the transformation of precipitation to recharge is currently underestimated kotchoni et al 2019 the present slr results indicate that the expected precipitation can impact the recharge positively or negatively depending on the season emission scenario and geographical location crosbie et al 2013a mccallum et al 2010 temperature and evapotranspiration other factors including non climatic variables such as land use changes and water pumping and hydrological model parameters can have direct influences on surface groundwater resources green et al 2011 for the oceania region crosbie et al 2012 2013a mccallum et al 2010 all agreed that gwr is connected to rainfall when rainfall increases recharge increases and vice versa for example in australia mccallum et al 2010 found that a change by 1 in rainfall without any change in other parameters led to a corresponding change of 2 on gwr in tunisia benabdallah et al 2018 predicted that a reduction in rainfall by 16 6 along with a temperature increase of 1 8 c would decrease the recharge by 29 15 39 26 by mid century these results are comparable with those from other regions such as north america clilverd et al 2011 mckenna and sala 2017 and africa meddi and boucefiane 2013 a projected increase in temperature is also found to affect some regions in particular africa as the amount of surface evaporation is expected to increase this will lead to deterioration in soil structure and less gwr kahsay et al 2018 el asri et al 2019 and kahsay et al 2018 have both expected rise in temperature and deficit in precipitation as less surface runoff resulted leading to gwr reduction by 1 3 and 40 respectively under rcp 4 5 in africa conversely a positive impact on gwr was expected in some parts of north america asia and europe for example mountainous areas in north america expected to receive more rainfall compared to others and resulted in an increase in gwr by 16 to 24 for mid to end century time periods respectively lindquist et al 2019 for europe an expected increase in gwr was also predicted since rise in temperature was expected to positively affect precipitation positively klammler et al 2013 there is a notable lack of studies on the relationship between gwr and snowmelt precipitation in particular for highly elevated or mountainous aquifers green et al 2011 a few journal articles studied the effect of cc on snowmelt clilverd et al 2011 luoma and okkonen 2014 and they consistently expected an increase in snowmelt due to rise in air temperature and in turn to an increase in gwr also neukum and azzam 2012 predicted an increase in snowmelt which led to increase surface runoff and more gwr studying the effect of hydrogeology parameters e g temperature and precipitation can be useful for water management and help researchers and stakeholders to better plan and reduce the effects of droughts and flooding resulting from cc related extreme events langridge and fencl 2020 recently a number of studies have taken place to investigate the impact of land use and land cover lulc on gwr yet insufficient management strategies have been implemented based on current urbanization speed population growth and agricultural activities pan et al 2011 lulc can impact the amount of runoff and gwr in many ways such as increase in impervious surface area in urbanized areas and hence a decrease in gwr similarly areas of high vegetation will have less runoff and in turn gwr compared to arid to semi arid regions owuor et al 2016 land restoration can noticeably decrease the recharge rates for example brewington et al 2019 simulated the magnitude of gwr in hawaii without sugarcane crops and or restoration of natural forests for end of century timeline the results showed an increase in gwr by 1 to 11 for different scenarios in another example ehlers et al 2016 showed a projected decrease in gwr in certain sardinia italy areas by 17 43 for the 2071 2100 period due to now only a decrease in rainfall but also an increase in grass evapotranspiration it is noteworthy to understand the spatio temporal distribution and process of gwr under land use changes in order to estimate groundwater vulnerability to environmental pollutants carried by gwr langridge and fencl 2020 climate induced changes are anticipated to have an intense influence on aquifer system quality and quantity unconfined aquifers in arid to semi arid regions or coastal areas were found to more vulnerable to cc and environmental contamination hadjinicolaou et al 2011 based on the present slr unconfined aquifers in the africa region were expected to have high vulnerability due to less precipitation and gwr higher temperature increase in evaporation and higher withdrawal rates this might lead to rapid decrease in water levels increase in salinity and hence deterioration of water quality as an example kahsay et al 2018 showed that the baseline recharge 45 23 mm yr was projected to decrease by 3 4 for rcp 2 6 and 1 3 for rcp 4 5 respectively based on prior mentioned reasons moreover luoma and okkonen 2014 displayed that coastal aquifers are susceptible to cc impacts in relation to saltwater intrusion from the sea groundwater resources are fundamental for domestic use food industries irrigation other socio economic activities therefore water quality standards must be maintained to meet usage demands green et al 2011 3 3 2 projected changes in gwr 3 3 2 1 global scale projections this section introduces the results of projected gwr for global level studies efforts are still ongoing to understand the current and the future climate five relevant papers were identified where three papers included information about gwr projections two papers were global scale review papers about groundwater resources earman and dettinger 2011 green et al 2011 and they both concluded that climate change e g high temperature high evaporation and shifts in rainy seasons among other associated factors e g human activities are affecting gw and surface water resources quantity and quality portmann et al 2013 analysed the effect of climate change on gw resources including recharge using the global hydrological model watergap with four emissions scenarios the outcomes revealed that global gwr would decrease more than 10 by 2080s gwr baseline volume of 13 404 km3 yr while arid to semi arid regions will suffer a decrease of more 30 mohan et al 2018 emphasised the importance of obtaining sufficient data for vegetation and climate to calculate an accurate value for gwr 3 3 2 2 regional scale projections and level of consensus in total 54 research papers contained regional scale projections of gwr studies examined gwr projections in terms of annual seasonal or monthly changes projected up to the end of this century 2100 using different climate models and emission scenarios 28 papers 51 performed projections up to the end of century 2100 while the rest of gwr modelling efforts had different projection time horizons see table s2 the results displayed two main groups of emission scenarios adopted to simulate gwr under climatic changes as shown on table s2 the first set is representative concentration pathways rcps containing four main scenarios which have been recently used in the ar5 assessment report pachauri et al 2014 as follows first rcp2 6 is a mitigation scenario which assumes to maintain potential warming below 2 c with respect to industrial activities after that both rcp4 5 and rcp6 0 are categorised as intermediate emissions while rcp8 5 represents the highest ghg emission scenario ipcc 2014b rcps are set to cover a wider range of ghg pathways compared to the special report on emissions scenarios sres sres are composed of four storylines and each storyline comprises a certain number of families nakicenovic et al 2000 the first storyline is a1 which includes three sub categories fossil intensive a1fi non fossil energy sources a1t or a balance across all sources a1b a1 represents a scenario with the highest socio economic and population growth by mid century and decreasing after then the a2 storyline depicts the world s heterogeneity in terms of economic development population growth and fertility rates the other two families are b1 and b2 which both assume global solutions to socio economic factors and environmental sustainability both figs 4 and 5 were drawn for rcp 4 5 8 5 and sres a2 b1 only a variety of time periods were selected for the simulation processes see table s2 approximately half of the studies targeted the end of century also a 30 year time slice was commonly used noting that few studies only targeted 2050 for gwr projections crosbie et al 2013a 2013b ficklin et al 2010b guerrero morales et al 2020 rodríguez huerta et al 2019 based on table s2 the results were as follows oceania four papers were identified by our slr crosbie et al 2013a examined the impact of cc on the whole australia in 2050 the modelled value of gwr 54 mm yr showed a potential reduction in gwr in south western regions and an expected increase in northern regions and small parts of eastern regions crosbie et al 2010 and crosbie et al 2012 investigated the effect of cc on gwr for the murray darling basin australia for end and mid century time horizons respectively they had varying results of projected gwr ranging between decreasing and increasing with the south west regions expected to have a reduction in gwr while north east regions were expected to have an increase mccallum et al 2010 displayed an expected decrease by 1 for baseline gwr in three locations in australia namely namoi river gwr of 56 mm yr howard east gwr of 200 mm yr and scottsdale gwr between 69 and 300 mm yr due to cc and rise in temperature at the end of this century north america out of 13 studies 4 articles indicated a decline in gwr and gw levels adane et al 2019 ficklin et al 2010b lauffenburger et al 2018 mckenna and sala 2017 for time horizons as shown in table s2 6 papers had varying results gwr increases were predicted as more likely to occur particularly in north eastern north central parts of usa beigi and tsai 2015 crosbie et al 2013b ng et al 2010 rivard et al 2014 rossman et al 2014 tillman et al 2016 by end century and canada by mid century rivard et al 2014 under a1b a2 and b1 scenarios on the other hand a decrease was expected in mid south regions another three papers consistently predicted an increase in gwr by the end of this century in hawaii brewington et al 2019 alaska clilverd et al 2011 and wyoming lindquist et al 2019 africa there was a consensus that all climate forcing models and scenarios rcp 2 6 4 5 8 5 sres a1b would lead to a decrease in the amount of projected gw replenishment and water table levels benabdallah et al 2018 el asri et al 2019 kahsay et al 2018 meddi and boucefiane 2013 nasta et al 2016 moreover anthropogenic activities represented by water pumping have already exacerbated the problem of depletion and it was predicted to worsen in the future in some part of africa such as ghana and mali toure et al 2016 yidana et al 2019 europe 15 studies were identified and analysed out of which spain received the greatest interest with three papers accordingly the simulated recharge rates in spain are predicted to decline pisani et al 2019 pulido velazquez et al 2015 raposo et al 2013 luoma and okkonen 2014 and klammler et al 2013 indicated a slight increase in finland and austria respectively most of other european countries such as germany greece hungary italy france belgium and portugal were predicted to be vulnerable to climatic changes and to suffer from a decrease in gwr in the studied locations behulu et al 2016 dams et al 2012 gemitzi et al 2017 haidu and nistor 2020 havril et al 2018 neukum and azzam 2012 pisani veiga et al 2013 raposo et al 2013 the uk had varying results yawson et al 2019 while switzerland can expect no significant changes based on simulated recharge values moeck et al 2016 asia out of 13 identified articles 6 papers revealed a decrease in gwr due to climate change mainly under sres a1b a2 b2 b1 scenarios ghazavi and ebrahimi 2019 goodarzi et al 2016 hassan 2020 patle et al 2017 thampi and raneesh 2015 for different time periods table s2 an expected increase in groundwater abstraction is also predicted to lead to degradation of the quantities of available water for china and iran ghazavi and ebrahimi 2019 wang et al 2020 by mid century five studies illustrated a positive impact on gwr slight to moderate increase under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 for iran and india awan and ismaeel 2014 kambale et al 2017 saatloo et al 2019 sishodia et al 2018 thampi and raneesh 2012 for early and mid century time periods finally one study predicted no impact on gwr due to climatic changes in south west parts of iran in the middle of the century particularly in the gareh bygone plain basin however a high influence of water pumping on gwr was noticed for historical data and predicted for the future hashemi et al 2015 latin america only three studies were identified specifically from mexico guerrero morales et al 2020 rodríguez huerta et al 2019 2020 where there was a predicted decline in annual and monthly recharge under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios by the mid century time range also groundwater extraction was expected to accelerate aquifer exhaustion rodriguez huerta et al 2019 lack of studies was found for south america and southern africa interestingly scientific efforts focused on assessing the influence of cc on gwr specifically but no study attempted to assess the relationship between socio economic impacts and changes in gwr since these can both affect and be affected by gwr 3 3 3 level of consensus in gwr fig 4 middle of century moc and fig 5 end of century eoc show the level of consensus amongst regional studies of the signal of projected change in gwr for each study the signal change was either a projected decrease 1 increase 1 or no change 0 where the level of consensus equals the average value of the projected signal for each location under specific emission scenario the maps show the normalised sum of the assigned signal change values as a measure of the level of consensus amongst studies overall for both north america and asia the research articles had varying expectations for the amount of gwr but the percentage of studies predicting a decrease exceeded those predicting an increase in most cases beigi and tsai 2015 ng et al 2010 petpongpan et al 2020 wang et al 2020 middle east africa and europe were found to be the most vulnerable to a decrease in gwr only three studies were found in latin america where mexico was the only targeted place however high rates of withdrawal from aquifers are expected to aggravate the decline of gwr rates rodriguez huerta et al 2019 further mid century projection had a large variety in study sites nevertheless the regional projections of gwr revealed a decline in recharge rates in most regions and an increase in the upper northern hemisphere only middle of century projections for oceania as seen in fig 4 there is a consensus amongst studies that there will be a gwr decrease in south west australia by moc under a2 and b1 scenarios crosbie et al 2010 2012 2013a but an agreed increase in annual and winter gwr for north east australia across sres b1 and a2 scenarios for north america a decrease in annual gwr is projected across all scenarios but alaska and hawaii are both projected to experience an increase in gwr under certain seasons and scenarios for canada gwr is expected to decrease by moc under sres a2 and b1 scenarios a decrease is projected across north africa middle east and mexico across all adopted seasons and scenarios in europe an annual and summer decrease and a winter increase is expected india showed a lack of agreement across seasons and scenarios the limited number of studies in latin america asia and africa may lead to insufficient knowledge about projected changes in gwr in these regions end of century projections fig 5 indicates there is a modelling consensus that gwr will decrease in north africa the middle east and mexico for all seasons and scenarios by eoc for north america an unanimous decrease in northern and mid usa for summer and winter seasons under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios and an annual gwr decrease in southern usa under all emission scenarios was predicted alaska and hawaii are both projected to experience an increase in gwr under all assessed seasons and scenarios in north east australia there is an agreement that there will be a decrease in gwr while mccallum et al 2010 displayed an expected decrease by 1 for gwr under a1fi scenario in three locations in australia namoi river howard east and scottsdale due to cc and rise in temperature at the end of this century for europe gwr is expected to decrease in summer and overall annually under all emission scenarios while an expected increase in winter season under sres a2 scenario was projected south east asia showed projected annual increase in gwr under rcp 8 5 in contrast a lack of agreement amongst studies was observed for in india under rcp 8 5 and sres a2 scenarios 3 4 uncertainty the projection of future gwr under a changing climate is subject to several sources of uncertainty including the following three main sources 1 intra model uncertainty associated with the inner model physics and inherent modelling processes uncertainty e g inner physical model uncertainty mckenna and sala 2017 and initial system conditions toure et al 2016 2 inter model uncertainty related to the different response of multiple global circulation models gcms to specified forcing agent emission scenarios 3 emission scenario uncertainty associated with the assumed future greenhouse gas emission pathways and the associated radiative forcing accordingly quantification and analysis of uncertainty are an integral part of environmental and water engineering studies based on the working group ii contribution to the ipcc s fifth assessment report wgii ar5 field et al 2014 two metrics are used to examine the sources of uncertainty 1 qualitative confidence where the degree of confidence and evidence are qualitatively reported e g theories scientific judgments and related assumptions and 2 quantitative measurements e g statistical distribution of the results or observations in this section a review of the quantitative measurements of uncertainty considered in previous studies are presented and summarised only 17 papers 31 quantified and or presented the sources of uncertainty in addition to the three main sources of uncertainty associated with climate modelling mentioned above another key source of uncertainty is related to the interaction between groundwater models and climate models and from inherent groundwater modelling uncertainty resulting from the complexity of nonlinear modelling xu et al 2008 the inherent uncertainty of the socio economic factors molina et al 2013 uncertainty related to atmospheric downscaling methods tillman et al 2017 and the uncertainty about the occurrence of future extreme events e g drought or flooding el asri et al 2019 are so far a subject of debate in the scientific community 3 4 1 identification and quantification of sources of uncertainty among the aforementioned sources of uncertainty inter model uncertainty was the most often considered in term of quantification 20 or emission scenarios uncertainty with natural variability often not properly accounted for fig 6 further only one study quantified the uncertainty from downscaling methods through gcm rcm coupling moeck et al 2016 many approaches are used to quantify or identify the uncertain variables which have a potential influence on the projected gwr values the use of probability distributions from ensemble of multiple gcms or from running the same gcm under multiple emission scenarios foley 2010 was the most common approach to characterise the uncertainty associated with the occurrence of certain future scenarios examples includes probability of exceedance crosbie et al 2012 2013b goodarzi et al 2016 haidu and nistor 2020 klammler et al 2013 lindquist et al 2019 rodriguez huerta et al 2020 sishodia et al 2018 or pearson type iii probability distribution lauffenburger et al 2018 other techniques such as kernel density estimation was used by adane et al 2019 to draw frequency distributions for different parameters such as rainfall and temperature monte carlo distribution was used by ng et al 2010 to quantify the uncertainty similar approaches can also be used for sensitivity analysis to identify and weigh the most impactful variables on future projections these methods represent a means of demonstrating uncertainty and a way of communicating the uncertainty around the predicted results teng et al 2017 3 5 verification methods 3 5 1 groundwater models performance gw models should be calibrated against historical data in order to verify their accuracy before being adopted and coupled with climate models a range of accuracy metrics were embraced for evaluation or accuracy purposes e g r2 coefficient of determination rmse root mean squared deviation pbias percent bias and nse nash sutcliffe as listed in table s2 however only 44 of studies reported validation metrics for the utilised gw models which could create a state of debate about model accuracy and reliability additionally the tendency of most studies was to focus on one way of verification whether it was for climate model verification and or the climate and or hydrological model calibration as no specific dataset was considered table s2 regarding the temporal intervals most studies focused only on annual and or monthly timescales as a reference of validation 3 5 2 climate model validation an assortment of verification metrics has been used to validate the climate models this includes the hindsight forecasting of climate gwr data and comparison with long term real global historical observations several verification techniques were observed and hence each study used different methods for specific datasets however only 52 7 of papers verified the downscaled gcm whilst others did not verify their models leaving behind unanswered questions about the model performance limitations as well as uncertainty notably all studies were unable to quantify the uncertainty related to extreme future weather conditions or socio economic effects taking into account the previous remarks such as gcms verification would help in quantifying the sources of uncertainty and raising the level of confidence in the validity of the results 4 recommendations and future insights our review highlighted how relevant former studies investigated the future effects of cc on gwr with various methods and techniques given that cc has impacted gwr in many ways and it is likely that current and future groundwater demand will increase further due to population growth green et al 2011 this will add extra pressure on our freshwater resources gwr predictions pointed towards a decrease in recharge values in many regions such as central and southern regions of usa and australia north africa and middle east while an increase in north east parts of australia north usa and europe is expected yidana et al 2019 reported a negative effect of water over pumping on groundwater aquifers especially for africa and emphasised the importance of data quality and proper calibration validation processes for groundwater models to optimize water resources management further yagbasan 2016 identified increased aquifers stress in the future imposed by a combination of cc and socio economic impacts and new technologies should be developed to reduce ghg emissions groundwater quality and quantity can be preserved through different ways surveillance on illegal water withdrawal rational water consumption adopting native landscape crops using organic nutrients or less chemical pesticides and control waste disposal also encouraging and developing rainfall harvesting technologies particularly in developing countries where water resources are scarce in addition to increasing the tendency towards using alternative energy sources that would mitigate the impact of ghg and other pollutants is recommended the adopted hydrological models were discussed in detail the advantages and disadvantages and study related limitations were demonstrated based on table s3 models limitations were related to their functionality modeller s preferences and assumptions data availability intra model uncertainty and or climate variability and extreme events while earth s climate features have always changed nonlinearity in weather events trigger tipping points large scale single events and uncertainties associated to radiative forcing and aerosols are still challenging for modellers due to our limited understanding of such phenomena ipcc 2014a nevertheless from this review few recommendations are provided to achieve better predictions of cc impacts on gwr 1 improve gcms to have finer resolutions and extra levels of detail despite releasing cmip6 which contains higher resolution runs a number of climatologists have claimed inconsistency between high end values and paleoclimate records which might affect equilibrium climate sensitivity ecs meehl et al 2020 2 further investigations on surface and subsurface interactions and risks linked to extreme precipitation variations such as droughts and floods which currently cannot be properly predicted assessed 3 new climate models that can predict the individual impact of e g the atlantic meridional overturning circulation amoc weijer et al 2020 or amundsen sea low asl bracegirdle et al 2020 4 special climate models can simulate plant specific growth based on certain pesticides and nutrients 5 since most previous work used groundwater levels and surface discharge for calibration purposes using other observed parameters e g hydraulic conductivity might help with model calibration and validation barnett et al 2012 6 an attempt to maximize data acquisition for complex hydrological systems is needed in order to obtain high quality results 7 multi disciplinary studies combining e g geology hydrology biology and social sciences expertise at various local to international levels can help to comprehensively model and achieve a more sustainable management of groundwater resources 5 conclusion this study reviewed research from the past decade in relation to gwr and projected changes due to cc a systematic literature review framework was applied for the period between 2010 and 2020 as a result 73 scientific articles were analysed in line with the scope and objectives of this review we summarised future projected gwr identified the sources of uncertainty that were accounted for and prevalence of different modelling methodologies results show that cc may directly affect future gwr based on gwr projections an overall negative impact on gwr emerged regardless of emission scenarios or time horizons used lack of agreement was observed in certain regions such as central and southern india and eastern asia seasonality was often not properly assessed as most of studies considered annual projections in addition a lack of global scale research that thoroughly investigates future gwr was observed conducting an investigation at the global scale would require a joint effort from all parts of the world and in practice it is hard to achieve however increasing the number of studies in various regions of the world helps in one way or another to increase our understanding of the impact of cc on gwr uneven geographical distribution of study cases was noticed with developing countries such as mali ghana and iraq receiving the least share of publications compared to the developed countries of north america or western europe this research also described and summarised the types of deployed gwr modelling approaches their pros and cons and the required data the results illustrated that process based models were the most common model type used due to their accuracy and highly detailed presentation of the results the identification of weaknesses and strengths of different types of gwr modelling approaches can help the modeller to confidently identify the most appropriate model based on their preferences and available resources often a combination of different models was used and given the increasing amount of relevant high frequency data collected by several sensors around the world future studies might further explore hybrid process based data driven modelling frameworks despite the variety of methodologies adopted few gaps in knowledge persist especially due to the lack of a comprehensive accounting for all sources of uncertainty raising the level of confidence on the results through considering quantifying and clearly representing all possible sources of

4282,understanding the influence of climate change cc on groundwater recharge gwr is fundamental for a better long term planning and management of groundwater supply to date several regional research studies have been conducted to quantify climate induced factors on gwr however no study has summarised such recent modelling efforts to provide a global picture of projected changes in groundwater recharge over the long term in this research peer review articles related to cc gwr over the last 10 years were critically identified appraised and analysed the analysis focused on identifying the sources of uncertainty considered in such studies the modelling approaches adopted and finally the gwr projections results show a predominant use of process based models also only 20 of studies considered inter model uncertainty 11 considered emission scenario uncertainty and no studies considered intra model uncertainty a decrease in gwr for north africa southern europe and latin america regions was consistently projected oceania north america europe and asia had varying projections depending on emission scenario and season importantly overall a decline in gwr in most regions of the world can be expected though often the modelling was not supported by comprehensive quantification of uncertainty these findings can serve decision makers and researchers to develop sustainable plans to preserve this resource for future generations keywords groundwater recharge uncertainty climate change projections 1 introduction groundwater is a critical source of freshwater that meets the demand of a large portion of the earth s population industries and eco systems döll 2009 okkonen et al 2010 in 2014 the amount of global freshwater withdrawal was estimated to be about 4 trillion m3 ritchie and roser 2017 crucially there are many semi arid to arid regions such as the middle east africa mena region with limited surface water chambel 2015 jakeman et al 2016 which rely heavily on groundwater for their freshwater needs in africa drought and over exploitation were found to be the main causes of groundwater depletion between 2003 and 2009 equivalent to approximately 143 6 km3 which is comparable to the volume of the dead sea i e 147 km3 voss et al 2013 such climate and anthropogenic issues hinder a sustainable groundwater management moving forward leading to the deterioration in water quality and decreasing water levels groundwater recharge gwr is one of the main determining factors for the sustainability and hydrological balance of subsurface regimes döll and fiedler 2008 thampi and raneesh 2012 gwr is the amount of water percolating to a certain area into aquifers from the ground surface after rain or the infiltration underneath the neighbouring water bodies such as lakes and ponds gwr is controlled in part by atmospheric processes such as precipitation and evaporation and consequently any changes in the global climate can have a significant influence on groundwater in terms of its quality and quantity chambel 2015 sowers et al 2011 thus understanding the spatio temporal processes of recharge rates is paramount for groundwater management and sustainability smerdon 2017 gwr is difficult to be measured on site anderson et al 2015a alternative indirect methods can be used such as process based and empirical models however this leads to the introduction of further sources of uncertainty while quantifying the effects of climate change cc on gwr as stated in the fifth assessment report ar5 from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc projections indicate that cc will be the main stressor impacting on future surface and groundwater resources field et al 2014 it is therefore important to assess and quantify the current and future influences on groundwater resources based on different climatic conditions whilst the number of studies was somewhat limited before 2007 a noticeable increase can be seen after that field et al 2014 with the release of the ipcc fourth assessment report however despite the high numbers of recent studies the influence of future climate change on gwr remains largely uncertain mustafa et al 2019 future cc projections of gwr are subject to a wide range of sources of uncertainty including hydrological model surface or groundwater selection akbarpour and niksokhan 2018 hashemi et al 2015 her et al 2019 and development toure et al 2016 as well as the inherent uncertainty in ensemble general circulation models gcms and assumed emissions scenarios clilverd et al 2011 yidana et al 2019 additionally the uncertainty in future projections of recharge rates originating from hydrological models has not been sufficiently studied her et al 2019 finally the uncertainty arising from model conceptualisation and withdrawal scenarios has not been fully investigated yet mustafa et al 2019 a number of research studies have been undertaken including a review by smerdon 2017 which included a synopsis of six publications on cc and groundwater in the united states of america usa only i e regional scale smerdon 2017 summarized future cc impacts on gwr and sources of uncertainty related to gw modelling without any details about gw modelling approaches simulation approaches types of climate models periods of simulation and gwr projections under different emission scenarios further meixner et al 2016 completed a regional scale study in western usa regarding the potential impacts on recharge due to climate change such former efforts focus on a regional area on a global level mohan et al 2018 worked on 715 different sites worldwide and a gwr map was generated with values ranging between 0 and 1375 mm yr showing arid regions in australia middle east and sahara receiving the least value of recharge 1 mm yr this study however contained only general overviews about groundwater resources and no future gwr values were estimated a few review papers at the global scale exist e g earman and dettinger 2011 green et al 2011 holman et al 2012 however they are almost 10 years old at the time of writing and they served as a general review about groundwater resources with a limited focus on gwr consequently this paper provides a systematic literature review slr of studies into future projections of gwr from the past 10 years the paper is structured as follows the remainder of section 1 provides a brief introduction of how cc might affect grw section 2 provides an overview of the adopted slr method and content classification criteria section 3 contains the findings from the review including gw modelling approaches gwr projections and sources of uncertainty conclusions are drawn in section 4 1 1 expected climate change impacts on groundwater recharge typically cc is defined as change in the state of earth s climate over decades or centuries it also refers to alterations in natural and anthropogenic activities on world s energy balance arneth et al 2019 examples of such changes include rise in sea level ice sheets and glaciers melting depletion of ozone o3 layer changes in precipitation patterns and air temperature field and barros 2014 the ipcc fifth assessment report indicated that cc can affect gwr in many ways responses might vary between increasing and decreasing changes in rainfall patterns and drought events and frequency are the main features of impact further rise in temperature leads to increase evaporation and then less groundwater replenishment occurs also higher evaporation was synchronised with anthropogenic effects e g water pumping can affect the quantity and quality e g increasing salinity of groundwater ipcc 2014a 2 research methods 2 1 literature search scope the literature review search was limited to the web of science and scopus databases and the search keywords were groundwater and recharge and climate change only studies published from january 2010 to december 2020 were considered due to the prevalence of studies after 2010 based on search keywords and criteria the number of studies before 2010 from both database sources was less than 20 the search was limited to english language publications from peer reviewed journals conference proceedings or grey literature were not considered 2 2 screening and eligibility criteria the initial search returned 56 papers from scopus and 63 papers from web of science yielding a total of 83 papers after the elimination of duplicates next the following screening and elimination criteria were applied fig 1 the first criterion was by title next the abstract and full text were evaluated based on two standards the research paper should include sufficient information about gwr modelling i e type of model type of data length of study period and boundary conditions and or future prediction of gwr in relation to cc and uncertainty the research paper should not include qualitative only approaches 2 3 content classification the final 73 papers were divided into two groups based on the presence of gwr predictions the 54 papers which included gwr predictions were further classified based on the following the geographical location of the study site the groundwater modelling approach for projected observations on gwr the application of sensitivity analysis in conjunction with the sources of uncertainty and also the climate models used table s1 includes specific information regarding the resulting publications specifically the citation details the geographic location baseline values of gwr the projected observation on gwr and the adopted groundwater modelling approach studies were also analysed in terms of uncertainty consideration table s2 provides metadata of previously adopted climate models reference details baseline periods simulation periods verification metrics and validation calibration periods both tables s1 and s2 can be found in the supplementary material sm 2 4 additional search criteria due to lack of global studies related to the aforementioned search criteria other criteria were also adopted to include papers with information about global gwr modelling e g modelling type and database time period and or gwr projections under cc the defined search keywords were climate change and groundwater and recharge for in this case both paper title and abstract from the same database sources scopus and web of science the outcome was 5 additional research papers 3 results and analysis in this section the literature review is discussed in the context of three main topics 1 modelling approaches 2 projected changes in gwr and 3 uncertainty sources 3 1 publication counts and study areas fig 2 shows the annual publication counts separated based on modelling methodology with total number of publications ranging from 4 to 6 per year with the exception of 2018 which yielded 15 papers most studies were performed in europe 19 research papers 26 7 after europe both north america and asia accounted for 18 articles each africa 10 articles oceania 5 articles and latin america 3 papers recorded a lower number of studies as shown infig 3 3 2 modelling approaches in relation to gwr projection modelling three methods have been utilised to quantify gwr and or evaluate the impact of cc on it these are 1 lumped water balance models 2 distributed process based models and 3 data driven models the results were classified into two categories namely those with gwr projections and without lumped water balance models only consider mass conservation and consider the aquifer as a black box where gwr can be simulated as a simple function of other parameters anderson et al 2015b on the other hand a distributed process based model can consider the spatial distribution and fluxes movement of the aquifer and also deal with different levels of complexity conversely the main principle of data driven models is to find relationships and correlations between available data for system variables for a certain location among the 55 papers considering future projections simulation scenarios lumped water balance models or distributed process based models were applied in the most cases 90 9 whilst 9 1 of the papers applied data driven models with respect to overall gwr modelling papers 66 articles 92 used a wide range of process based models specifically 18 papers used lumped water balance models e g el asri et al 2019 and the rest adopted distributed process based models such as help rivard et al 2014 modflow hashemi et al 2015 or wetspass hamdi et al 2020 3 2 1 lumped water balance models these models are simple and consider the gw aquifer as a whole as the spatial variations are not accounted simple water balance was found to be the most commonly used methodology 18 papers 27 7 water balance is one of the older well known approaches used for gwr computation it is a simplified approach that grants modellers a comprehensive overview of water systems for a specific region it consists of a formula where water balance is estimated based on the amount of incoming and outgoing water from a groundwater system under steady state conditions bredehoeft et al 1982 one of the main weaknesses is to consider change in water storage to be negligible further extreme events such as long term drought might hinder the hydrological equilibrium of the aquifer system in turn inaccurate results of gwr may occur bredehoeft et al 1982 table s3 shows specific information regarding model selection and limitations for each study generally simple water balance was selected due to a lower data requirement allowing gwr to be estimated even in cases of lack of hydro geology data when the study area covers complex geology formation 3 2 2 distributed process based models distributed process based d pb models can be broadly defined as mathematical normally computer based models that deal with spatio temporal variations and complexity of groundwater systems this modelling approach was extensively applied in the 10 year period of our review different types of groundwater d pb models exist and pros and cons are summarised in table 1 more information on such modelling approach and applications in the reviewed papers can be found in sm 3 2 3 data driven models data driven models are built based on the empirical site specific relationships between groundwater system variables kenda et al 2018 five papers applied such empirical approach for gwr simulations crosbie et al 2010 2012 2013a pulido velazquez et al 2015 rodriguez huerta et al 2019 both crosbie et al 2010 and crosbie et al 2012 chose the murray darling basin mdb in australia to evaluate the effect of cc on gwr crosbie et al 2010 created a power regression formula between annual gwr and annual rainfall to run scenarios for different soil types and other climatic parameters a simple empirical formula was drawn between the variations in gwr and in precipitation to run future scenarios in crosbie et al 2012 crosbie et al 2013a adopted crosbie et al 2010 equation but their study targeted the whole australia pulido velazquez et al 2015 ran different scenarios to calculate gwr using a non linear regression formula for runoff as daily rainfall was the input of this model rodríguez huerta et al 2019 used a complex formula between gwr and aquifer discharge as the discharge referred to water consumption 3 3 cc and hydrogeology regimes interactions understanding the current and future interconnection between cc and surface subsurface systems is vital for groundwater management to avoid issues such as aquifers depletion due to over pumping and consumption and salt water leakage langridge and fencl 2020 the main components of a hydrogeological system include precipitation both snow and rainfall snow melting evapotranspiration base flow soil moisture and temperature and the aquifer system those components can be easily affected by global changes in climate natural variability and anthropogenic factors green et al 2011 the spatio temporal changes of the climate can influence the timing quantity and distribution of gwr and hence groundwater storage cuthbert et al 2019 sensitivity of aquifers to cc is found to be higher in shallow aquifers than deep aquifers especially when they are under stress barron et al 2011 specific examples are provided in section 03 3 1 projected changes in hydrogeological parameters and gwr the impact of cc on the sustainability of groundwater resources is challenging and it is complex to provide comprehensive practical management strategies kiparsky et al 2017 further the projected values of gwr are still influenced by the inherent uncertainty of the future climate forecasting particularly long term time horizon projections recently a significant number of studies have been conducted to investigate those changes and to determine the main climate indicators affecting gwr projections for better future understanding the subsequent sections present the results of projected changes in gwr and their correlation with changing in hydrological factors 3 3 1 projected changes in hydrogeological parameters and gwr one of the fey factors controlling gwr is precipitation while the transformation of precipitation to recharge is currently underestimated kotchoni et al 2019 the present slr results indicate that the expected precipitation can impact the recharge positively or negatively depending on the season emission scenario and geographical location crosbie et al 2013a mccallum et al 2010 temperature and evapotranspiration other factors including non climatic variables such as land use changes and water pumping and hydrological model parameters can have direct influences on surface groundwater resources green et al 2011 for the oceania region crosbie et al 2012 2013a mccallum et al 2010 all agreed that gwr is connected to rainfall when rainfall increases recharge increases and vice versa for example in australia mccallum et al 2010 found that a change by 1 in rainfall without any change in other parameters led to a corresponding change of 2 on gwr in tunisia benabdallah et al 2018 predicted that a reduction in rainfall by 16 6 along with a temperature increase of 1 8 c would decrease the recharge by 29 15 39 26 by mid century these results are comparable with those from other regions such as north america clilverd et al 2011 mckenna and sala 2017 and africa meddi and boucefiane 2013 a projected increase in temperature is also found to affect some regions in particular africa as the amount of surface evaporation is expected to increase this will lead to deterioration in soil structure and less gwr kahsay et al 2018 el asri et al 2019 and kahsay et al 2018 have both expected rise in temperature and deficit in precipitation as less surface runoff resulted leading to gwr reduction by 1 3 and 40 respectively under rcp 4 5 in africa conversely a positive impact on gwr was expected in some parts of north america asia and europe for example mountainous areas in north america expected to receive more rainfall compared to others and resulted in an increase in gwr by 16 to 24 for mid to end century time periods respectively lindquist et al 2019 for europe an expected increase in gwr was also predicted since rise in temperature was expected to positively affect precipitation positively klammler et al 2013 there is a notable lack of studies on the relationship between gwr and snowmelt precipitation in particular for highly elevated or mountainous aquifers green et al 2011 a few journal articles studied the effect of cc on snowmelt clilverd et al 2011 luoma and okkonen 2014 and they consistently expected an increase in snowmelt due to rise in air temperature and in turn to an increase in gwr also neukum and azzam 2012 predicted an increase in snowmelt which led to increase surface runoff and more gwr studying the effect of hydrogeology parameters e g temperature and precipitation can be useful for water management and help researchers and stakeholders to better plan and reduce the effects of droughts and flooding resulting from cc related extreme events langridge and fencl 2020 recently a number of studies have taken place to investigate the impact of land use and land cover lulc on gwr yet insufficient management strategies have been implemented based on current urbanization speed population growth and agricultural activities pan et al 2011 lulc can impact the amount of runoff and gwr in many ways such as increase in impervious surface area in urbanized areas and hence a decrease in gwr similarly areas of high vegetation will have less runoff and in turn gwr compared to arid to semi arid regions owuor et al 2016 land restoration can noticeably decrease the recharge rates for example brewington et al 2019 simulated the magnitude of gwr in hawaii without sugarcane crops and or restoration of natural forests for end of century timeline the results showed an increase in gwr by 1 to 11 for different scenarios in another example ehlers et al 2016 showed a projected decrease in gwr in certain sardinia italy areas by 17 43 for the 2071 2100 period due to now only a decrease in rainfall but also an increase in grass evapotranspiration it is noteworthy to understand the spatio temporal distribution and process of gwr under land use changes in order to estimate groundwater vulnerability to environmental pollutants carried by gwr langridge and fencl 2020 climate induced changes are anticipated to have an intense influence on aquifer system quality and quantity unconfined aquifers in arid to semi arid regions or coastal areas were found to more vulnerable to cc and environmental contamination hadjinicolaou et al 2011 based on the present slr unconfined aquifers in the africa region were expected to have high vulnerability due to less precipitation and gwr higher temperature increase in evaporation and higher withdrawal rates this might lead to rapid decrease in water levels increase in salinity and hence deterioration of water quality as an example kahsay et al 2018 showed that the baseline recharge 45 23 mm yr was projected to decrease by 3 4 for rcp 2 6 and 1 3 for rcp 4 5 respectively based on prior mentioned reasons moreover luoma and okkonen 2014 displayed that coastal aquifers are susceptible to cc impacts in relation to saltwater intrusion from the sea groundwater resources are fundamental for domestic use food industries irrigation other socio economic activities therefore water quality standards must be maintained to meet usage demands green et al 2011 3 3 2 projected changes in gwr 3 3 2 1 global scale projections this section introduces the results of projected gwr for global level studies efforts are still ongoing to understand the current and the future climate five relevant papers were identified where three papers included information about gwr projections two papers were global scale review papers about groundwater resources earman and dettinger 2011 green et al 2011 and they both concluded that climate change e g high temperature high evaporation and shifts in rainy seasons among other associated factors e g human activities are affecting gw and surface water resources quantity and quality portmann et al 2013 analysed the effect of climate change on gw resources including recharge using the global hydrological model watergap with four emissions scenarios the outcomes revealed that global gwr would decrease more than 10 by 2080s gwr baseline volume of 13 404 km3 yr while arid to semi arid regions will suffer a decrease of more 30 mohan et al 2018 emphasised the importance of obtaining sufficient data for vegetation and climate to calculate an accurate value for gwr 3 3 2 2 regional scale projections and level of consensus in total 54 research papers contained regional scale projections of gwr studies examined gwr projections in terms of annual seasonal or monthly changes projected up to the end of this century 2100 using different climate models and emission scenarios 28 papers 51 performed projections up to the end of century 2100 while the rest of gwr modelling efforts had different projection time horizons see table s2 the results displayed two main groups of emission scenarios adopted to simulate gwr under climatic changes as shown on table s2 the first set is representative concentration pathways rcps containing four main scenarios which have been recently used in the ar5 assessment report pachauri et al 2014 as follows first rcp2 6 is a mitigation scenario which assumes to maintain potential warming below 2 c with respect to industrial activities after that both rcp4 5 and rcp6 0 are categorised as intermediate emissions while rcp8 5 represents the highest ghg emission scenario ipcc 2014b rcps are set to cover a wider range of ghg pathways compared to the special report on emissions scenarios sres sres are composed of four storylines and each storyline comprises a certain number of families nakicenovic et al 2000 the first storyline is a1 which includes three sub categories fossil intensive a1fi non fossil energy sources a1t or a balance across all sources a1b a1 represents a scenario with the highest socio economic and population growth by mid century and decreasing after then the a2 storyline depicts the world s heterogeneity in terms of economic development population growth and fertility rates the other two families are b1 and b2 which both assume global solutions to socio economic factors and environmental sustainability both figs 4 and 5 were drawn for rcp 4 5 8 5 and sres a2 b1 only a variety of time periods were selected for the simulation processes see table s2 approximately half of the studies targeted the end of century also a 30 year time slice was commonly used noting that few studies only targeted 2050 for gwr projections crosbie et al 2013a 2013b ficklin et al 2010b guerrero morales et al 2020 rodríguez huerta et al 2019 based on table s2 the results were as follows oceania four papers were identified by our slr crosbie et al 2013a examined the impact of cc on the whole australia in 2050 the modelled value of gwr 54 mm yr showed a potential reduction in gwr in south western regions and an expected increase in northern regions and small parts of eastern regions crosbie et al 2010 and crosbie et al 2012 investigated the effect of cc on gwr for the murray darling basin australia for end and mid century time horizons respectively they had varying results of projected gwr ranging between decreasing and increasing with the south west regions expected to have a reduction in gwr while north east regions were expected to have an increase mccallum et al 2010 displayed an expected decrease by 1 for baseline gwr in three locations in australia namely namoi river gwr of 56 mm yr howard east gwr of 200 mm yr and scottsdale gwr between 69 and 300 mm yr due to cc and rise in temperature at the end of this century north america out of 13 studies 4 articles indicated a decline in gwr and gw levels adane et al 2019 ficklin et al 2010b lauffenburger et al 2018 mckenna and sala 2017 for time horizons as shown in table s2 6 papers had varying results gwr increases were predicted as more likely to occur particularly in north eastern north central parts of usa beigi and tsai 2015 crosbie et al 2013b ng et al 2010 rivard et al 2014 rossman et al 2014 tillman et al 2016 by end century and canada by mid century rivard et al 2014 under a1b a2 and b1 scenarios on the other hand a decrease was expected in mid south regions another three papers consistently predicted an increase in gwr by the end of this century in hawaii brewington et al 2019 alaska clilverd et al 2011 and wyoming lindquist et al 2019 africa there was a consensus that all climate forcing models and scenarios rcp 2 6 4 5 8 5 sres a1b would lead to a decrease in the amount of projected gw replenishment and water table levels benabdallah et al 2018 el asri et al 2019 kahsay et al 2018 meddi and boucefiane 2013 nasta et al 2016 moreover anthropogenic activities represented by water pumping have already exacerbated the problem of depletion and it was predicted to worsen in the future in some part of africa such as ghana and mali toure et al 2016 yidana et al 2019 europe 15 studies were identified and analysed out of which spain received the greatest interest with three papers accordingly the simulated recharge rates in spain are predicted to decline pisani et al 2019 pulido velazquez et al 2015 raposo et al 2013 luoma and okkonen 2014 and klammler et al 2013 indicated a slight increase in finland and austria respectively most of other european countries such as germany greece hungary italy france belgium and portugal were predicted to be vulnerable to climatic changes and to suffer from a decrease in gwr in the studied locations behulu et al 2016 dams et al 2012 gemitzi et al 2017 haidu and nistor 2020 havril et al 2018 neukum and azzam 2012 pisani veiga et al 2013 raposo et al 2013 the uk had varying results yawson et al 2019 while switzerland can expect no significant changes based on simulated recharge values moeck et al 2016 asia out of 13 identified articles 6 papers revealed a decrease in gwr due to climate change mainly under sres a1b a2 b2 b1 scenarios ghazavi and ebrahimi 2019 goodarzi et al 2016 hassan 2020 patle et al 2017 thampi and raneesh 2015 for different time periods table s2 an expected increase in groundwater abstraction is also predicted to lead to degradation of the quantities of available water for china and iran ghazavi and ebrahimi 2019 wang et al 2020 by mid century five studies illustrated a positive impact on gwr slight to moderate increase under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 for iran and india awan and ismaeel 2014 kambale et al 2017 saatloo et al 2019 sishodia et al 2018 thampi and raneesh 2012 for early and mid century time periods finally one study predicted no impact on gwr due to climatic changes in south west parts of iran in the middle of the century particularly in the gareh bygone plain basin however a high influence of water pumping on gwr was noticed for historical data and predicted for the future hashemi et al 2015 latin america only three studies were identified specifically from mexico guerrero morales et al 2020 rodríguez huerta et al 2019 2020 where there was a predicted decline in annual and monthly recharge under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios by the mid century time range also groundwater extraction was expected to accelerate aquifer exhaustion rodriguez huerta et al 2019 lack of studies was found for south america and southern africa interestingly scientific efforts focused on assessing the influence of cc on gwr specifically but no study attempted to assess the relationship between socio economic impacts and changes in gwr since these can both affect and be affected by gwr 3 3 3 level of consensus in gwr fig 4 middle of century moc and fig 5 end of century eoc show the level of consensus amongst regional studies of the signal of projected change in gwr for each study the signal change was either a projected decrease 1 increase 1 or no change 0 where the level of consensus equals the average value of the projected signal for each location under specific emission scenario the maps show the normalised sum of the assigned signal change values as a measure of the level of consensus amongst studies overall for both north america and asia the research articles had varying expectations for the amount of gwr but the percentage of studies predicting a decrease exceeded those predicting an increase in most cases beigi and tsai 2015 ng et al 2010 petpongpan et al 2020 wang et al 2020 middle east africa and europe were found to be the most vulnerable to a decrease in gwr only three studies were found in latin america where mexico was the only targeted place however high rates of withdrawal from aquifers are expected to aggravate the decline of gwr rates rodriguez huerta et al 2019 further mid century projection had a large variety in study sites nevertheless the regional projections of gwr revealed a decline in recharge rates in most regions and an increase in the upper northern hemisphere only middle of century projections for oceania as seen in fig 4 there is a consensus amongst studies that there will be a gwr decrease in south west australia by moc under a2 and b1 scenarios crosbie et al 2010 2012 2013a but an agreed increase in annual and winter gwr for north east australia across sres b1 and a2 scenarios for north america a decrease in annual gwr is projected across all scenarios but alaska and hawaii are both projected to experience an increase in gwr under certain seasons and scenarios for canada gwr is expected to decrease by moc under sres a2 and b1 scenarios a decrease is projected across north africa middle east and mexico across all adopted seasons and scenarios in europe an annual and summer decrease and a winter increase is expected india showed a lack of agreement across seasons and scenarios the limited number of studies in latin america asia and africa may lead to insufficient knowledge about projected changes in gwr in these regions end of century projections fig 5 indicates there is a modelling consensus that gwr will decrease in north africa the middle east and mexico for all seasons and scenarios by eoc for north america an unanimous decrease in northern and mid usa for summer and winter seasons under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios and an annual gwr decrease in southern usa under all emission scenarios was predicted alaska and hawaii are both projected to experience an increase in gwr under all assessed seasons and scenarios in north east australia there is an agreement that there will be a decrease in gwr while mccallum et al 2010 displayed an expected decrease by 1 for gwr under a1fi scenario in three locations in australia namoi river howard east and scottsdale due to cc and rise in temperature at the end of this century for europe gwr is expected to decrease in summer and overall annually under all emission scenarios while an expected increase in winter season under sres a2 scenario was projected south east asia showed projected annual increase in gwr under rcp 8 5 in contrast a lack of agreement amongst studies was observed for in india under rcp 8 5 and sres a2 scenarios 3 4 uncertainty the projection of future gwr under a changing climate is subject to several sources of uncertainty including the following three main sources 1 intra model uncertainty associated with the inner model physics and inherent modelling processes uncertainty e g inner physical model uncertainty mckenna and sala 2017 and initial system conditions toure et al 2016 2 inter model uncertainty related to the different response of multiple global circulation models gcms to specified forcing agent emission scenarios 3 emission scenario uncertainty associated with the assumed future greenhouse gas emission pathways and the associated radiative forcing accordingly quantification and analysis of uncertainty are an integral part of environmental and water engineering studies based on the working group ii contribution to the ipcc s fifth assessment report wgii ar5 field et al 2014 two metrics are used to examine the sources of uncertainty 1 qualitative confidence where the degree of confidence and evidence are qualitatively reported e g theories scientific judgments and related assumptions and 2 quantitative measurements e g statistical distribution of the results or observations in this section a review of the quantitative measurements of uncertainty considered in previous studies are presented and summarised only 17 papers 31 quantified and or presented the sources of uncertainty in addition to the three main sources of uncertainty associated with climate modelling mentioned above another key source of uncertainty is related to the interaction between groundwater models and climate models and from inherent groundwater modelling uncertainty resulting from the complexity of nonlinear modelling xu et al 2008 the inherent uncertainty of the socio economic factors molina et al 2013 uncertainty related to atmospheric downscaling methods tillman et al 2017 and the uncertainty about the occurrence of future extreme events e g drought or flooding el asri et al 2019 are so far a subject of debate in the scientific community 3 4 1 identification and quantification of sources of uncertainty among the aforementioned sources of uncertainty inter model uncertainty was the most often considered in term of quantification 20 or emission scenarios uncertainty with natural variability often not properly accounted for fig 6 further only one study quantified the uncertainty from downscaling methods through gcm rcm coupling moeck et al 2016 many approaches are used to quantify or identify the uncertain variables which have a potential influence on the projected gwr values the use of probability distributions from ensemble of multiple gcms or from running the same gcm under multiple emission scenarios foley 2010 was the most common approach to characterise the uncertainty associated with the occurrence of certain future scenarios examples includes probability of exceedance crosbie et al 2012 2013b goodarzi et al 2016 haidu and nistor 2020 klammler et al 2013 lindquist et al 2019 rodriguez huerta et al 2020 sishodia et al 2018 or pearson type iii probability distribution lauffenburger et al 2018 other techniques such as kernel density estimation was used by adane et al 2019 to draw frequency distributions for different parameters such as rainfall and temperature monte carlo distribution was used by ng et al 2010 to quantify the uncertainty similar approaches can also be used for sensitivity analysis to identify and weigh the most impactful variables on future projections these methods represent a means of demonstrating uncertainty and a way of communicating the uncertainty around the predicted results teng et al 2017 3 5 verification methods 3 5 1 groundwater models performance gw models should be calibrated against historical data in order to verify their accuracy before being adopted and coupled with climate models a range of accuracy metrics were embraced for evaluation or accuracy purposes e g r2 coefficient of determination rmse root mean squared deviation pbias percent bias and nse nash sutcliffe as listed in table s2 however only 44 of studies reported validation metrics for the utilised gw models which could create a state of debate about model accuracy and reliability additionally the tendency of most studies was to focus on one way of verification whether it was for climate model verification and or the climate and or hydrological model calibration as no specific dataset was considered table s2 regarding the temporal intervals most studies focused only on annual and or monthly timescales as a reference of validation 3 5 2 climate model validation an assortment of verification metrics has been used to validate the climate models this includes the hindsight forecasting of climate gwr data and comparison with long term real global historical observations several verification techniques were observed and hence each study used different methods for specific datasets however only 52 7 of papers verified the downscaled gcm whilst others did not verify their models leaving behind unanswered questions about the model performance limitations as well as uncertainty notably all studies were unable to quantify the uncertainty related to extreme future weather conditions or socio economic effects taking into account the previous remarks such as gcms verification would help in quantifying the sources of uncertainty and raising the level of confidence in the validity of the results 4 recommendations and future insights our review highlighted how relevant former studies investigated the future effects of cc on gwr with various methods and techniques given that cc has impacted gwr in many ways and it is likely that current and future groundwater demand will increase further due to population growth green et al 2011 this will add extra pressure on our freshwater resources gwr predictions pointed towards a decrease in recharge values in many regions such as central and southern regions of usa and australia north africa and middle east while an increase in north east parts of australia north usa and europe is expected yidana et al 2019 reported a negative effect of water over pumping on groundwater aquifers especially for africa and emphasised the importance of data quality and proper calibration validation processes for groundwater models to optimize water resources management further yagbasan 2016 identified increased aquifers stress in the future imposed by a combination of cc and socio economic impacts and new technologies should be developed to reduce ghg emissions groundwater quality and quantity can be preserved through different ways surveillance on illegal water withdrawal rational water consumption adopting native landscape crops using organic nutrients or less chemical pesticides and control waste disposal also encouraging and developing rainfall harvesting technologies particularly in developing countries where water resources are scarce in addition to increasing the tendency towards using alternative energy sources that would mitigate the impact of ghg and other pollutants is recommended the adopted hydrological models were discussed in detail the advantages and disadvantages and study related limitations were demonstrated based on table s3 models limitations were related to their functionality modeller s preferences and assumptions data availability intra model uncertainty and or climate variability and extreme events while earth s climate features have always changed nonlinearity in weather events trigger tipping points large scale single events and uncertainties associated to radiative forcing and aerosols are still challenging for modellers due to our limited understanding of such phenomena ipcc 2014a nevertheless from this review few recommendations are provided to achieve better predictions of cc impacts on gwr 1 improve gcms to have finer resolutions and extra levels of detail despite releasing cmip6 which contains higher resolution runs a number of climatologists have claimed inconsistency between high end values and paleoclimate records which might affect equilibrium climate sensitivity ecs meehl et al 2020 2

in order to obtain high quality results 7 multi disciplinary studies combining e g geology hydrology biology and social sciences expertise at various local to international levels can help to comprehensively model and achieve a more sustainable management of groundwater resources 5 conclusion this study reviewed research from the past decade in relation to gwr and projected changes due to cc a systematic literature review framework was applied for the period between 2010 and 2020 as a result 73 scientific articles were analysed in line with the scope and objectives of this review we summarised future projected gwr identified the sources of uncertainty that were accounted for and prevalence of different modelling methodologies results show that cc may directly affect future gwr based on gwr projections an overall negative impact on gwr emerged regardless of emission scenarios or time horizons used lack of agreement was observed in certain regions such as central and southern india and eastern asia seasonality was often not properly assessed as most of studies considered annual projections in addition a lack of global scale research that thoroughly investigates future gwr was observed conducting an investigation at the global scale would require a joint effort from all parts of the world and in practice it is hard to achieve however increasing the number of studies in various regions of the world helps in one way or another to increase our understanding of the impact of cc on gwr uneven geographical distribution of study cases was noticed with developing countries such as mali ghana and iraq receiving the least share of publications compared to the developed countries of north america or western europe this research also described and summarised the types of deployed gwr modelling approaches their pros and cons and the required data the results illustrated that process based models were the most common model type used due to their accuracy and highly detailed presentation of the results the identification of weaknesses and strengths of different types of gwr modelling approaches can help the modeller to confidently identify the most appropriate model based on their preferences and available resources often a combination of different models was used and given the increasing amount of relevant high frequency data collected by several sensors around the world future studies might further explore hybrid process based data driven modelling frameworks despite the variety of methodologies adopted few gaps in knowledge persist especially due to the lack of a comprehensive accounting for all sources of uncertainty raising the level of confidence on the results through considering quantifying and clearly representing all possible sources of uncertainty can assist decision makers and stakeholders in taking successful measures and precautions for future sustainable gw management declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

4283,remote sensing can potentially be used to monitor river ice which is of significance for water resource utilization and hydrological research especially on the tibetan plateau over which field observations are severely limited however methods to monitor the river ice distribution over a large scale while overcoming snow interference have not been reported yet to monitor river ice on the tibetan plateau on a large scale we present a relative difference river ice rdri identification method based on the differential spectral characteristics of river ice the difference between the red and near infrared nir band reflectance of river ice is divided by the sum of the nir reflectance and infrared band reflectance the resulting values are notably different for river ice and other neighboring similar landscapes such as snow cover this method can overcome the interference caused by snow cover and other surrounding landscapes and enable the monitoring of river ice in different forms at different elevations on the tibetan plateau the rdri method is applied to landsat and sentinel 2 images the validation results show that the mean overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were 99 76 and 0 94 respectively the comparison of the rdri and normalized difference snow index ndsi methods indicates that the accuracies of both methods for river ice monitoring are similar in the absence of any snow disturbance the rdri can enable more accurate remote sensing of river ice on a large scale which can support river ice distribution research over the tibetan plateau keywords tibetan plateau river ice remote sensing rdri method 1 introduction river ice frequently appears in numerous rivers in temperate and cold regions river ice monitoring is of significance for transportation hydraulic engineering construction and flood management in cold regions cooley and pavelsky 2016 river ice freezing and melting are closely correlated with the local hydrology climate variation and ecosystems which have notable regional characteristics shiklomanov and lammers 2014 tedesco et al 2015 the headstream areas of many of asia s great rivers lie in the tibetan plateau which has a complex terrain li et al 2016b this region has a dry climate and low snow cover in river valley areas and rivers are usually frozen in winter therefore freeze thaw impacts such as freeze up breakup and ice jams considerably influence the regional hydrological processes conducting river ice studies in high altitude regions especially the tibetan plateau is highly challenging due to the lack of in situ ground validation data the tibetan plateau has undergone substantial warming since the mid 1950s liu and chen 2000 li et al 2008 qin and ding 2009 yao et al 2012 and the hydrologic role of river ice may have changed unfortunately the river ice distribution on the tibetan plateau is unclear and the current data and methods lead to only a limited understanding of this aspect remote sensing technology can be used to conduct comprehensive and rapid large scale monitoring of river ice to realize river ice monitoring the satellite sensor bands must be able to capture the differences in the spectral features between river ice and other surrounding landscapes and the spatial resolution of the image must be suitable to identify the river ice from the earth surface features cooley and pavelsky 2016 at present optical and aerospace radar data have been applied to monitor river ice tedesco et al 2015 generally optical sensors have a high spatial and spectral resolution short return period and wide coverage therefore such sensors are commonly used to determine the area and distribution of river ice on a global scale and monitor the freezing and melting states of river ice the associated data can serve as a reference to extract river ice by using the synthetic aperture radar sar data cook and bradley 2010 early river ice monitoring was dependent on visual or human computer interpretations river ice has a high reflectivity in the visible bands but a low reflectivity in the shortwave infrared swir band this aspect is considerably different from that of the neighboring ground features and can be considered to extract the distribution range of river ice for example in an early river ice remote sensing study mcginnis and schneider 1978 employed an interactive system known as the man machine interactive processing system to monitor the ice break up on the ottawa river reaches by using national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa 4 polar orbiting satellite images gatto 1990 visually compared the ice extent on rivers by using landsat images 30 m and other sensor images in the northern united states pavelsky and smith 2004 used the visual interpretation method to obtain the date of river ice thawing on the scale of arctic basins by using the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis satellite images muhammad et al 2016 investigated the distribution range of river ice through manual interpretation and by combining the reference digital number values of each typical feature by using daily modis images moreover an increasing number of researchers have proposed a series of methods for river ice monitoring the normalized difference snow index ndsi is commonly used to identify a snow cover and ice hall and riggs 2011 the ndsi refers to the value obtained by dividing the reflectivity difference of the visible and swir bands by the reflectivity sum of the two bands hall and riggs 2011 the ndsi can be calculated as follows 1 ndsi r vis r swir r vis r swir where rvis and rswir are the reflectivity values of the visible and swir bands respectively the ndsi can be effectively used to distinguish ice and river water and has been recommended for application in related studies such as in the extensive detection of river ice rupture procedures pavelsky and smith 2004 for example the ndsi was used to determine the extent and state of river ice yan et al 2004 liu et al 2010 however the traditional ndsi method cannot separate river ice from snow cover in addition chaouch et al 2014 presented classification thresholds by using a decision tree method and modis images for river ice monitoring kraatz et al 2016 proposed a semitransparent cloud detection method based on the surface reflectivity of modis data bands 4 and 7 cooley and pavelsky 2016 described an automated method and used modis images to detect river ice break up to increase the accuracy of river ice mapping kraatz et al 2017 contrasted the visible infrared imager radiometer sensor viirs modis cloud masks in rivers including developing ice beaton et al 2019 proposed an automatic method to detect the date of river ice rupture from modis images by using a threshold based technique to maximize the river coverage and minimize the impact of cloud blocking recently unmanned remote sensing technology was used to realize river ice monitoring wang et al 2014 alfredsen et al 2018 moreover the sar technology can be used to monitor river ice compared to optical sensors the most prominent advantage of sar is that it is not considerably affected by clouds and can identify river ice types several researchers have used the sar technique to extract the distribution and identify the types of river ice bernier and gauthier 2006 lindenschmidt et al 2011 jasek et al 2013 in addition the sar technology can be potentially used to retrieve the thickness of river ice lindenschmidt et al 2011 mermoz et al 2012 although reliable results have not been obtained yet notably most sar sensors have a low temporal resolution except for sentinel 1 which leads to a certain uncertainty in detecting break up dates or changes moreover the narrow coverage and data complexity of sar limit its applications in monitoring river ice on a large scale sentinel 1 has demonstrated promising application prospects due to its excellent spatial and temporal resolutions los and pawlowski 2017 and thus this method can likely be used to realize river ice monitoring however the existing studies mainly focused on monitoring the river ice at specific river reaches through visual interpretation and classification based on digital number values and thus the current methods cannot distinguish river ice and snow and monitor river ice on a large scale in addition only a few researchers attempted to monitor the river ice in high altitude mountain regions especially the tibetan plateau li et al 2020 first clarified the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of river ice at the basin scale on the tibetan plateau by using nearly twenty years of landsat images however this method cannot be applied on a large scale owing to limitations associated with the snow interference and regional terrain because of the complex terrain and climatic environment of the tibetan plateau the distribution features and patterns of river ice are unique and different from those in the arctic circle regions to monitor river ice on a large scale on the tibetan plateau we developed a relative difference river ice rdri identification method that can overcome interference from snow and other surrounding landscapes first we calibrated the optimal threshold of the method and determined other restrictions second we evaluated the monitoring accuracy of the method by using landsat and sentinel 2 images for different areas and dates third we compared the rdri and ndsi methods and analyzed their advantages and disadvantages 2 methods and data 2 1 study area the area of the tibetan plateau is 2 57 106 km2 and the mean elevation exceeds 4000 m the region includes abundant snow and glacial resources and river ice is widely distributed this plateau is a typical highly cold region with an average temperature annual of 4 0 c chen 2015 during the winter which lasts from october to may of the next year most areas have more than 30 d of snow cover huang et al 2017 most regions on this plateau have a dry climate low cloud cover low snow accumulation in the river valleys and a small amount of long term snow over the river ice the main types of rivers in this region are braided and canyon type rivers li et al 2016a this region mainly includes the upstream region of rivers with widths less than 1 km and the river discharge and widths are significantly smaller than those in the middle or lower reaches according to field investigations river ice is widely distributed in this high mountain region li et al 2009 we calibrated the threshold and validated the distinguishing ability of the rdri method on the northeastern tibetan plateau next we validated the accuracy of the rdri method at twelve sites over the tibetan plateau fig 1 considering the fact that river ice may involve certain differences in these basins we selected a typical site for validation in each basin and selected three validation sites in the inner basin largest basin the relevant information of these basins and distribution of the validation sites are presented in table 1 the precise location of the twelve validation sites was mainly determined by the actual distribution of the river ice notably the spatial resolution of the tibetan plateau dem data is 90 m tibetan plateau science data center 2 2 methods 2 2 1 rdri method the rdri method is based on the reflectivity difference between the red and near infrared nir bands divided by the reflectivity sum of the nir and infrared swir1 bands which is a unique method for river ice detection the relevant formula is as follows 2 rdri r red r nir r nir r swir where rred rnir and rswir are the reflectivity values of the red nir and swir bands respectively the rdri method threshold must be calibrated when using this method when the rdri value is greater than the threshold it corresponds to river ice in particular the optimal rdri method threshold of river ice may vary in different regions due to the differences in the type and thickness of river ice an optimal threshold should be able to identify river ice and overcome any snow interference accurately the reflectivity difference in the red and nir bands of river ice is larger than that of snow and other entities which is the basis of the rdri method the sum of the reflectivity of snow in the nir and swir1 bands is greater than that of river ice which can be used to distinguish river ice and snow further the difference in the reflectivity of the red and nir bands divided by the sum of the reflectivity of the nir and swir1 bands can more effectively distinguish river snow and ice in addition several additional conditions must be considered to overcome the interference of water shadows and other surrounding landscapes the application of the rdri method requires red nir and swir bands although the band setting differs for different sensors for thematic mapper tm and enhanced thematic mapper etm data bands 3 red 4 nir and 5 swir1 are used to derive the rdri value for operational land imager oli data bands 4 red 5 nir and 6 swir1 are used to derive the rdri value for sentinel 2 data bands 4 red 8 nir and 11 swir1 are used to derive the rdri value we used the swir1 band instead of the swir2 band in this method because the reflectivity of river ice and snow is more stable in the swir1 band than that in the swir2 band the swir1 band is more widely applied than the swir2 band which is specifically designed for geological applications 2 2 2 calibration of the rdri method threshold the suitable rdri method threshold for river ice is calibrated based on the rdri value distribution statistic of river ice from the images a suitable threshold can identify river ice and eliminate the interference of snow cover and other surrounding landscapes first we selected a cloud free oli image january 13 2014 involving developed river ice and a certain amount of snow and calculated the rdri value of this image second we used the nir red and green bands to compose a false color image to highlight the river ice and identified the river ice through visual interpretation in this image the river ice and snow appeared in cyan blue and white respectively third according to the visual interpretation results of the river ice and rdri value of this image we estimated a suitable threshold at which river ice should be reliably identified based on the rdri method and this threshold large scale river ice monitoring could be realized to enhance the stability of the suitable threshold three typical areas with developed river ice containing thin ice and thick ice were selected to calibrate the suitable threshold we used the mean value of the three thresholds as the suitable rdri method threshold in this study which was calibrated in the three typical areas for higher precision a 15 m fusion image was used to visually interpret the river ice and the result was regarded as the true value information next the area ratio of the river ice area obtained using each rdri value to the visually interpreted river ice area was calculated when this ratio was equal to 1 the two areas were equal the rdri value could be regarded as the calibrated threshold for this area the mean value of the three calibrated thresholds could be considered to be the suitable threshold for the given images over the whole tibetan plateau to make the threshold more robust we additional used etm and tm images for the threshold calibration for these images the average value of the calibration value at five sites was selected as the threshold 2 2 3 accuracy evaluation index for the validation of the monitoring accuracy of the rdri method a confusion matrix was used to evaluate the agreement between the river ice obtained using the rdri method and visual interpretation considered to be true data in this case the confusion matrix technique is widely used to evaluate the error between the image classification results and real ground situations the precision of this method defined as khat was calculated based on the kappa analysis statistic congalton 1991 this statistic is an estimate of the kappa values between the real ground situation and remote sensing classification results this value is a measure of consistency or accuracy when khat is 80 40 80 or 40 the classification accuracy is high medium or low respectively khat can be calculated as follows 3 k hat n i 1 r x ii j 1 r x i x i n 2 j 1 r x i x i where n is the total number of pixels r is the number of rows in the matrix x ii is the number of observations in row i and column i and x i and x i are the marginal totals of row i and column i respectively the overall accuracy oa is defined as the ratio of the number of accurately classified pixels to the total number of pixels and oa can be calculated as follows 4 oa i 1 r x ii n 2 3 satellite images the satellite images that could be applied in this study were required to satisfy two requirements first the sensor was required to have the necessary band for the rdri method second the spatial resolution of the images was required to satisfy the river ice recognition requirements consequently considering the availability of images and the river ice size in this area we selected landsat and sentinel 2 images for this study the images were provided by the google earth engine platform https earthengine google com and were atmospherically corrected data were processed on this platform we selected cloud free images in the calibration and validation areas through visual identification 2 3 1 landsat imagery the following types of images from three landsat sensors were considered tm landsat 5 etm landsat 7 and oli landsat 8 the spatial resolution of the bands used is 30 m landsat 5 was launched on march 1 1984 and was inactivated on december 21 2011 landsat 7 was launched on april 15 1999 and is currently operating normally and landsat 8 was launched on february 11 2013 and is currently operating normally these satellites have a 16 d revisit period the band settings of the landsat sensors are as follows table 2 2 3 2 sentinel 2 imagery sentinel 2 includes two satellites the first and second satellites sentinel 2a and sentinel 2b were launched on june 23 2015 and march 07 2017 respectively sentinel 2 is a high resolution multispectral imaging satellite that carries a multispectral imager msi for land monitoring the msi has an altitude of 786 km which covers 13 spectral bands with a width of 290 km table 3 the ground resolutions are 10 m 20 m and 60 m the revisit period of one satellite is ten days and the revisit period of the two complementary satellites is five days 2 4 validation of the rdri method first we validated the ability of the rdri method to distinguish river ice from other surrounding landscapes through the measured spectral data and remote sensing images oli involving river ice in a typical area on the northeastern tibetan plateau second we validated the monitoring accuracy of the rdri method at two scales including specific sites and pixels over the tibetan plateau 2 4 1 rdri ability for ice snow discrimination using in situ data to validate that the rdri can distinguish river ice from the surrounding landscape we used the measured spectral curve of river ice and other ground features in the field the measured spectral data can accurately provide the spectral characteristics of different types of river ice in all wavebands and serve as reference for the determination of the rdri threshold the measured spectral data are not affected by atmospheric factors we chose different types of river ice for measurement and obtained images of the river ice texture we measured the reflectivity of river ice and snow at a local time of 12 pm by using the psr 3500 spectrometer the reflectivity curves of the river ice and snow cover could be generated using the measured reflectivity data of the full spectrum finally we chose several spectral curves of river ice with different surfaces and calculated the rdri value for further comparison and use in the rdri threshold test moreover we measured the spectral curve of snow for comparison with that of the river ice 2 4 2 rdri ability for ice snow discrimination by using the oli image the oli is a high performance sensor that can help define the spectral reflectivity of river ice in the commonly used bands of multispectral sensors we selected an oli image january 13 2014 to validate the ability of the rdri method to distinguish river ice from the surrounding landscape in the image the remote sensing image was affected by atmospheric factors the selected image included river ice and other typical ground features in the study area such as snow and soil first we used a 543 band synthesis image to highlight the differences in the images between river ice and other ground features second we selected the sample areas of the ground features in the image to compare their reflectivity in each band oli finally we calculated the rdri values of each ground feature for validation 2 4 3 evaluation of the rdri accuracy over different ice forms we validated the monitoring accuracy of the rdri method at twelve different sites over the whole tibetan plateau by using oli etm and tm images moreover we validated the monitoring accuracy of the rdri method on different dates on the northeastern tibetan plateau by using sentinel 2 images the images were dated from january to march river ice development period and the validation sites were visually inspected to ensure cloud free conditions the detailed imaging time of each image is marked in figs 5 8 we attempted to choose sites involving developed river ice in different spatial distribution forms such as the wide accumulation wide dispersion and main channel types and validated the monitoring accuracy of the rdri method by using the visual interpretation results of river ice it was considered that if the monitoring accuracy of the rdri method based on the calibrated threshold satisfied the requirements the rdri method and this threshold could be used to extract river ice on a large scale in the considered region 2 4 4 evaluation of the rdri accuracy at selected pixels we validated the monitoring accuracy of the rdri method at several pixels over the whole tibetan plateau by using the oli images the image used for validation was the mean value image generated by the oli images with a cloud cover of less than 20 from january to march 2018 the location of the pixels was determined considering the different basins and topography of the entire tibetan plateau the comprehensiveness and rationality of the pixel positions were taken into account the pixels covered the river ice range in this region adequate to validate the effectiveness of the rdri method considering the inhomogeneous and discontinuous distribution of river ice we adopted two schemes to select the accuracy validation pixels fig 1 first certain validation pixels were arranged on the river channel in the study area green second the validation pixels were directly arranged in the study area without river regions red the minimum number of sampling points required for testing was determined using the fellow formula edwards et al 1998 5 n u 1 a 2 2 d 2 p 1 p where n is the minimum number of sampling points p is the percentage of points pertaining to correct classifications at specific sites u is the value corresponding to the confidence level from the probability table of the normal distribution d is the allowable range of error and a is set according to the accuracy requirements after determining the number and position of pixels we manually checked the classification accuracy of each pixel 3 results 3 1 rdri threshold calibration the calibration areas of the oli images included the hexi and yellow basins the rivers in the hexi basin are inland rivers and the selected calibration area was a typical inland river channel the river in the yellow basin is an exoreic river and the chosen calibration areas were typical exoreic river channels in general the distribution form and characteristics of the river ice in these areas are typical and representative moreover the spectral reflectivity of the river ice was measured in the hexi basin according to the visual interpretation results of the river ice at sites o1 o2 and o3 fig 2 we calibrated the proper threshold of the rdri method to monitor the river ice in this area corresponding to an rdri value 0 13 furthermore to eliminate the interference from water bodies and shadows we added conditions of rnir 0 10 which referenced the ndsi and rred rnir 0 068 as obtained from the shadow reflectivity statistics the three calibration sites were typical river ice development areas that represented different predominant distribution shapes of river ice such as the wide accumulation type o1 wide dispersion type o2 and main channel type o3 at the three sites when the area ratio extracted and interpreted areas of the river ice was equivalent to 1 the rdri values were 0 149 0 119 and 0 132 fig 2 the average value of the three calibrated thresholds for the three sites was 0 13 in addition the suitable threshold of the tm and etm images was determined to 0 13 by using the same process fig 2 calibrating the rdri method threshold is critical to extract river ice accurately when the rdri method is used in other regions the threshold may need to be recalibrated an extremely low or high rdri method threshold may result in the overestimation or underestimation of the river ice area respectively 3 2 validation of the ability of the rdri method to discriminate river ice and land the spectral reflectivity of the river ice obtained from the measured data and oli image were validated to ensure that the rdri method could distinguish river ice and overcome the interference of other surrounding landscapes including soil rocks and hay the rdri values of river ice obtained from field measurements and the image were larger than 0 27 and 0 54 respectively both values were within the calibrated threshold 0 13 the difference in the rdri value between the image and measured data could be attributed to the influence of the atmosphere sensor performance and algorithms employed in satellite data processing 3 2 1 use of the measured data the validation results of field measurements showed that the rdri method could effectively monitor the river ice and overcome interference from other surrounding landscapes fig 3 five typical spectral curves of river ice and snow and spectral curves of soil dry grass and water were selected to highlight the differences in the spectral characteristics the reflectivity difference in the red and nir bands of river ice was larger than that in the other bands this result was consistent with the simulation results the albedo of ice in the nir band 760 60 nm was significantly lower than that of snow according to the snow radiation transfer simulation liang et al 2017 as the river ice transparency increased the river ice reflectivity decreased in the red band although it did not change considerably in the nir band although the spectral features of river ice and snow are similar the reflectivity difference in the red and nir bands of river ice was larger than that of snow fig 3 the reflectivity difference for the river ice was larger than 0 17 but the reflectivity difference of snow 1 was 0 13 the values for snow 2 and snow 3 were smaller in addition the sum of the reflectivity values for the nir and swir1 bands of river ice was smaller than that of snow the value for river ice was less than 0 71 but that of snow 1 was 0 78 the values for snow 2 and snow 3 were larger the rdri values of river ice were larger than 0 27 and those for snow were 0 17 in addition the differences in the reflectivity pertaining to the red and nir bands of soil and dry grass were less than zero and the rdri method did not misjudge these entities the additional condition of rnir 0 10 could help avoid water interference 3 2 2 use of oli images the results showed that the rdri method could clearly distinguish river ice by considering the river ice spectral characteristics in the oli images and overcoming the impact of snow and soil in the oli 543 band synthetic image the river ice and snow appeared in cyan blue and white respectively fig 4 a the soil appeared in brown and was thus distinct from the river ice and snow we chose the typical river ice snow and soil areas to determine the mean reflectivity curves the reflectivity curves of the selected river ice snow and soil areas in each band of the oli sensor are shown in fig 4b the difference in the red and nir reflectivity of river ice was greater than that of snow the value for river ice was greater than 0 27 and that for snow was smaller than 0 01 table 4 moreover the sum of the reflectivity values in the nir and swir1 bands of river ice was smaller than that for snow the value for river ice was smaller than 0 50 and that for snow was larger than 0 72 the rdri value for the selected river ice region was larger than 0 54 although that of the selected snow region was smaller than 0 01 the spectral curve of soil showed that the rdri value of soil was less than zero and thus the soil did not interfere in the river ice extraction based on the rdri method 3 3 validation of the rdri method monitoring accuracy 3 3 1 use of the oli images at specific sites the validation results showed that the river ice could be accurately extracted using the oli images and the rdri method with the calibrated threshold 0 13 at the twelve validation sites a b c d e f g h i j k and l the oli images and extracted river ice from each site are shown in fig 5 compared with the visual interpretation results the rdri method could accurately extract river ice with only a few misjudgments and slight omissions for thin ice or scattered river ice the rdri method did not misclassify snow as river ice at the twelve validation sites the mean oa and khat were 99 81 and 0 97 respectively at validation sites a b g and j river ice was concentrated and the missed river ice was thin ice or river ice with water underneath at validation sites c d and e the terrain was flat and the missed river ice was mainly scattered thin ice validation sites f and l were typical braided river channels with relatively developed and scattered thin ice which corresponded to the omissions validation site h was a typical mountain dendritic drainage site with concentrated river ice a small amount of liquid water and lower omissions with a khat value of 0 9959 at validation sites i and k river ice was sporadically distributed in the high mountain area and the river ice that was missed was mainly thin ice excessively thin river ice may be missed when using the rdri method due to its low reflectivity in the visual or red bands 3 3 2 use of etm images at specific sites the validation results showed that the river ice could be accurately extracted using the etm images and rdri method with the calibrated threshold 0 13 at the twelve validation sites a b c d e f g h i j k and l the etm images and extracted river ice from each area are shown in fig 6 at most validation sites the rdri method extracted river ice was highly consistent with the results of the visual interpretation except at validation site f the mean oa and khat were 99 83 and 0 94 respectively except those at validation site k at validation sites a and b river ice was concentrated these cases corresponded to high classification accuracy and the missed river ice was thin ice or river ice with water underneath at validation sites c d and g river ice was relatively concentrated in the main channel and dispersed along the shore at validation sites e f i j and l the missed river ice was scattered and thin ice the classification errors corresponded mainly to river ice omission excessively thin river ice may be missed when using the rdri method due to its low reflectivity in the visual or red bands validation site h was a typical mountain dendritic drainage site with a high classification accuracy and the khat was 0 9956 at validation site k the etm image before sensor malfunction required excessive radiometric correction which led to the snow cover being was erroneously classified as river ice the main reason for the low accuracy for validation site k was the inferior image quality 3 3 3 use of tm images at specific sites the validation results showed that the river ice could be accurately extracted using the tm images and rdri method with the calibrated threshold 0 13 at the twelve validation sites a b c d e f g h i j k and l the tm images and extracted river ice from each site are shown in fig 7 the river ice extracted using the rdri method was highly consistent with the results of the visual interpretation the mean oa and khat were 99 88 and 0 95 respectively at validation sites a b c and d the river ice was thick and concentrated and corresponded to high classification accuracy at validation sites e f and l scattered thin river ice was distributed in the braided river channel and misjudgments occurred validation site h was a typical mountain dendritic drainage site with thick river ice and corresponded to high accuracy at validation sites i and k river ice was sporadically distributed in the high mountain area and the missed river ice was mainly thin ice the rdri method did not misclassify snow as river ice at validation site k in general the main reason for misclassification may be the insufficient spatial resolution of the image in addition river ice that is excessively thin may be missed when using the rdri method due to its low reflectivity in the visual or red bands especially at validation site f 3 3 4 use of sentinel 2 images of different dates the validation results showed that the river ice could be extracted using the sentinel 2 data and rdri method on the nine validation dates a b c d e f g h and i the sentinel 2 images and extracted river ice for each date are shown in fig 8 the images indicated the occurrence of river ice accumulation and gradual melting in this river reach the images from dates a to e and dates f to i corresponded to the accumulation period and melting period respectively in general the rdri method successfully extracted the river ice and the results were highly consistent with those of visual interpretation the mean oa and khat were 99 86 and 0 97 respectively the missed river ice was mainly thin ice and the river ice was covered with water the excessively thin river ice may be missed when using the rdri method due to its low reflectivity in the visual or red bands the river ice was thick and concentrated on dates a and c and corresponded to a high classification accuracy the missed river ice was mainly thin ice and the khat values were 0 9988 and 0 9948 respectively on dates b and d the river ice was covered with thick snow the rdri method did not entirely detect the river ice although it could distinguish the river ice and snow on date e the river ice reached the maximum thickness and corresponded to high classification accuracy with khat being 0 9977 from dates f to i the amount of liquid water on the surface of the river ice increased with the melting of the river ice which led to a decrease in reflectivity in the red band and caused certain river ice omissions therefore the classification accuracy of the river ice decreased significantly on dates h and i 3 3 5 consideration of pixels over the tibetan plateau the minimum number of sampling points was calculated using formula 3 and the mean oa at different sites was 99 88 we determined that the p value was 0 99 for a 0 01 that is the confidence level was 99 according to the table u 2 58 and the error allowed range was d 1 therefore n 659 we determined that the numbers of validation pixels on the river and those selected without considering the river channel were 670 and 697 respectively leading to 1328 total pixels we manually checked the classification accuracy of each pixel in terms of the validation accuracy for the whole tibetan plateau oa and kappa were 99 41 and 0 8828 respectively table 5 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of rdri and ndsi the rdri method can be used to detect river ice by considering the difference in the reflectivity in the red and nir bands divided by the sum of the reflectivity values for the nir and swir bands the rdri method can distinguish river ice and snow cover by considering the spectral differences between the two entities figs 3 and 4 however the ndsi method cannot distinguish river ice and snow cover the ndsi was designed to distinguish snow and land but not to differentiate between river ice and snow li et al 2020 used the maximum distribution range of the river ice to exclude snow cover in their study while the maximum distribution range was visually determined by combining images river systems and dem data such methods cannot be used on a large scale on the tibetan plateau and thus it was necessary to develop a method that can distinguish river ice and snow cover the ndsi method considers the spectral similarity between snow and ice the similarity between the rdri and ndsi methods is that both methods consider the difference in the reflectivity in specific bands divided by the sum of the specific band reflectivity and thus both rdri and ndsi methods correspond to ratio methods in addition both methods consider a nir band reflectivity of more than 0 1 to eliminate interference from water bodies due to the complex alpine terrain on the tibetan plateau shadow interference commonly occurs the rdri method considers a difference of more than 0 068 in the reflectivity in the red and nir bands to eliminate mountain shadow interference generally sensors with red nir and swir bands can be used to employ the rdri method in terms of river ice monitoring the advantage of the rdri method is that it can separate river ice from snow cover to highlight the difference in the extraction results of the two methods we chose an area involving both river ice and snow and zoomed it for a clear illustration fig 9 in the oli 543 band synthetic images the river ice and snow appear as cyan and white respectively fig 9a the extraction targets of the rdri and ndsi methods are the cyan part ice and cyan and white parts snow and ice respectively as shown in fig 9b river ice and snow were extracted without any notable difference thus the river ice and snow were mixed and could not be separated as shown in fig 9c only river ice was extracted and snow was not included to quantitatively compare the rdri and ndsi methods in terms of the river ice extraction we simultaneously extracted the river ice and calculated its area using the two methods in the comparison area fig 9d the results showed that the river ice areas extracted using the rdri and ndsi methods were 2 7299 km2 and 2 7194 km2 respectively the oa values of the rdri and ndsi methods were 93 19 and 92 83 respectively the similarity of the two areas was 99 6 which indicated that the two methods have a similar ability to extract river ice in the absence of any snow disturbance in cold regions river ice and snow simultaneously exist and in such scenarios the rdri method can be used to monitor river ice on a large scale accurately notably the rdri method cannot detect river ice when it is covered with thick snow as shown in fig 5f 7f 8b and 8d 4 2 applications the rdri method can be used to monitor river ice by using optical imagery on a large scale on the tibetan plateau this method is particularly applicable to this plateau which has a low latitude dry climate and low snow coverage this method can extract river ice by using landsat and sentinel 2 imagery and separate river ice from snow cover thereby serving as a useful tool to monitor the distribution range and characteristics of river ice on the tibetan plateau at present the ice in gullies or low lying areas in the tibetan plateau is considered part of the river ice because the tibetan plateau is mainly a mountainous region with complex terrain most of the ice is expected to sink in the river as it melts in addition due to the spatial resolution of the tibetan plateau river channel data and the easy deformation of the river channels it is difficult to accurately distinguish river ice from ice in gullies or low lying areas to reduce the threshold deviation we adopted the average rdri threshold of the three sites as the appropriate threshold for the study area the three sites were typical river ice development areas that represented different predominant distribution shapes of river ice to validate the monitoring accuracy of the rdri method we selected different types of river ice at different locations and elevations for comparative analysis highly accurate results were obtained among the different forms of river ice more concentrated and thicker river ice sites a and b could be more accurately monitored than more discrete and thin ice sites f h i and k in addition the topography and elevation did not influence the river ice monitoring the rdri value range pertaining to the measured reflectivity was different from the image reflectivity likely because of the atmospheric effects table 4 furthermore we used an oli image to examine the influence of the atmosphere on the rdri values text s3 the results showed that the atmospheric conditions did influence the rdri value and thus atmospheric corrections must be performed before using this method in addition the differences in the sensors used in this study likely influenced the rdri value and threshold although the validation accuracy indicated that it is not necessary to calibrate the threshold using each sensor at present notably when monitoring river ice by using the rdri method at a large scale on the tibetan plateau the results may also include lake ice and glaciers which must be eliminated lake ice has similar spectral characteristics as river ice owing to the similar physical structures of these entities thus the proposed method can also be used to monitor lake ice to enable a clear comparison between lake ice and river ice we used oli and modis images to monitor lake ice text s1 in addition certain glacier tongues have spectral characteristics similar to those of ice we selected a typical glacier area in this region as an example and the monitoring results obtained using the rdri and ndsi methods are presented in text s2 limitations this study was focused on introducing the rdri method and the elimination of cloud interference was not considered cloud disturbance is a common influential factor when using optical images the influence of clouds may partially limit the application of the rdri method and this aspect must be considered in future work moreover snow cover may hinder the extraction of river ice information and result in the omission of river ice when the river ice is covered by thick snow thicker than approximately 2 3 cm the rdri method cannot detect river ice the application of this method may thus be limited in areas with heavy snow cover such as the arctic circle therefore the selection of images with heavy snowfall must be avoided when monitoring river ice by using the rdri method in addition river ice that is excessively thin may be missed when using the rdri method due to its low reflectivity in the visual or red bands during the melting period meltwater appears on the surface of the river ice which significantly reduces the reflectivity of the nir band and leads to the omission of river ice this phenomenon occurred for the sentinel 2 validation dates h and i as described in section 3 4 fig 8 which led to a slight decrease in classification accuracy river ice may also exist in the shadow area of the mountain which may be monitored using a combination of two sensors at different crossing times to reduce omission when perform river ice and lake ice monitoring in other areas the rdri method threshold may need to be recalibrated because no field observations of river ice are available for this region it is difficult to validate the monitoring results using field observations directly the differences in sensor performance season temperature and atmosphere may influence the rdri values the limitations of this study also include the low temporal and spatial resolution of the landsat imagery owing to the temporal resolution of the images it is difficult to accurately monitor the freezing and melting of rivers using landsat images although joint monitoring using multiple sensors may help increase the temporal resolution the landsat and sentinel 2 images are suitable for the sizes of the river ice in this area in general owing to the limited spatial resolution of the landsat 8 imagery 30 m narrow river ice may be missed therefore the river ice area obtained in this study was slightly underestimated although the etm has a strip problem that affects the calculation of the river ice area it can provide useful data for monitoring the historical freezing and melting of rivers chen et al 2011 because of the low spatial resolution moderate spatial resolution 0 25 1 km sensor images are insufficient to monitor the river ice in this region 5 conclusions to perform river ice monitoring using remote sensing on a large scale on the tibetan plateau we proposed the rdri method that considers the difference in the reflectivity in the red and nir bands of river ice and other surrounding landscapes we suggest a threshold rdri value 0 13 for monitoring river ice on the tibetan plateau the measured spectral data and oli images demonstrated that the rdri method could effectively distinguish river ice and other surrounding landscapes and the monitoring accuracy at different sites and dates reached 0 94 mean khat compared with the traditional ndsi algorithm the advantage of the rdri method is that it can separate river ice from snow and other surrounding landscapes the accuracy of the two methods for river ice monitoring was similar in the absence of snow disturbance this method can be applied using current multispectral sensors such as landsat tm etm oli and sentinel 2 images no significant difference can be observed among the monitoring results obtained through these sensors the differences in sensor performance season temperature and atmosphere may influence the rdri method values generally the surrounding topography and elevation do not impact the river ice monitoring among different forms of river ice more concentrated and thicker river ice can be more accurately monitored than discrete and thin ice this method is suitable for the tibetan plateau which has a dry climate and low snow cover notably the rdri method cannot detect river ice underneath thick snow in addition the rdri method can likely monitor lake ice because lake ice and river ice have similar spectral characteristics to perform lake ice monitoring or river ice monitoring in other areas the rdri method threshold may need to be recalibrated the rdri method can facilitate the large scale monitoring of river ice on the tibetan plateau the area of river ice on the whole tibetan plateau can be monitored using this method and the results can provide support for regional water resource management and cryosphere research credit authorship contribution statement

4283,remote sensing can potentially be used to monitor river ice which is of significance for water resource utilization and hydrological research especially on the tibetan plateau over which field observations are severely limited however methods to monitor the river ice distribution over a large scale while overcoming snow interference have not been reported yet to monitor river ice on the tibetan plateau on a large scale we present a relative difference river ice rdri identification method based on the differential spectral characteristics of river ice the difference between the red and near infrared nir band reflectance of river ice is divided by the sum of the nir reflectance and infrared band reflectance the resulting values are notably different for river ice and other neighboring similar landscapes such as snow cover this method can overcome the interference caused by snow cover and other surrounding landscapes and enable the monitoring of river ice in different forms at different elevations on the tibetan plateau the rdri method is applied to landsat and sentinel 2 images the validation results show that the mean overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were 99 76 and 0 94 respectively the comparison of the rdri and normalized difference snow index ndsi methods indicates that the accuracies of both methods for river ice monitoring are similar in the absence of any snow disturbance the rdri can enable more accurate remote sensing of river ice on a large scale which can support river ice distribution research over the tibetan plateau keywords tibetan plateau river ice remote sensing rdri method 1 introduction river ice frequently appears in numerous rivers in temperate and cold regions river ice monitoring is of significance for transportation hydraulic engineering construction and flood management in cold regions cooley and pavelsky 2016 river ice freezing and melting are closely correlated with the local hydrology climate variation and ecosystems which have notable regional characteristics shiklomanov and lammers 2014 tedesco et al 2015 the headstream areas of many of asia s great rivers lie in the tibetan plateau which has a complex terrain li et al 2016b this region has a dry climate and low snow cover in river valley areas and rivers are usually frozen in winter therefore freeze thaw impacts such as freeze up breakup and ice jams considerably influence the regional hydrological processes conducting river ice studies in high altitude regions especially the tibetan plateau is highly challenging due to the lack of in situ ground validation data the tibetan plateau has undergone substantial warming since the mid 1950s liu and chen 2000 li et al 2008 qin and ding 2009 yao et al 2012 and the hydrologic role of river ice may have changed unfortunately the river ice distribution on the tibetan plateau is unclear and the current data and methods lead to only a limited understanding of this aspect remote sensing technology can be used to conduct comprehensive and rapid large scale monitoring of river ice to realize river ice monitoring the satellite sensor bands must be able to capture the differences in the spectral features between river ice and other surrounding landscapes and the spatial resolution of the image must be suitable to identify the river ice from the earth surface features cooley and pavelsky 2016 at present optical and aerospace radar data have been applied to monitor river ice tedesco et al 2015 generally optical sensors have a high spatial and spectral resolution short return period and wide coverage therefore such sensors are commonly used to determine the area and distribution of river ice on a global scale and monitor the freezing and melting states of river ice the associated data can serve as a reference to extract river ice by using the synthetic aperture radar sar data cook and bradley 2010 early river ice monitoring was dependent on visual or human computer interpretations river ice has a high reflectivity in the visible bands but a low reflectivity in the shortwave infrared swir band this aspect is considerably different from that of the neighboring ground features and can be considered to extract the distribution range of river ice for example in an early river ice remote sensing study mcginnis and schneider 1978 employed an interactive system known as the man machine interactive processing system to monitor the ice break up on the ottawa river reaches by using national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa 4 polar orbiting satellite images gatto 1990 visually compared the ice extent on rivers by using landsat images 30 m and other sensor images in the northern united states pavelsky and smith 2004 used the visual interpretation method to obtain the date of river ice thawing on the scale of arctic basins by using the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis satellite images muhammad et al 2016 investigated the distribution range of river ice through manual interpretation and by combining the reference digital number values of each typical feature by using daily modis images moreover an increasing number of researchers have proposed a series of methods for river ice monitoring the normalized difference snow index ndsi is commonly used to identify a snow cover and ice hall and riggs 2011 the ndsi refers to the value obtained by dividing the reflectivity difference of the visible and swir bands by the reflectivity sum of the two bands hall and riggs 2011 the ndsi can be calculated as follows 1 ndsi r vis r swir r vis r swir where rvis and rswir are the reflectivity values of the visible and swir bands respectively the ndsi can be effectively used to distinguish ice and river water and has been recommended for application in related studies such as in the extensive detection of river ice rupture procedures pavelsky and smith 2004 for example the ndsi was used to determine the extent and state of river ice yan et al 2004 liu et al 2010 however the traditional ndsi method cannot separate river ice from snow cover in addition chaouch et al 2014 presented classification thresholds by using a decision tree method and modis images for river ice monitoring kraatz et al 2016 proposed a semitransparent cloud detection method based on the surface reflectivity of modis data bands 4 and 7 cooley and pavelsky 2016 described an automated method and used modis images to detect river ice break up to increase the accuracy of river ice mapping kraatz et al 2017 contrasted the visible infrared imager radiometer sensor viirs modis cloud masks in rivers including developing ice beaton et al 2019 proposed an automatic method to detect the date of river ice rupture from modis images by using a threshold based technique to maximize the river coverage and minimize the impact of cloud blocking recently unmanned remote sensing technology was used to realize river ice monitoring wang et al 2014 alfredsen et al 2018 moreover the sar technology can be used to monitor river ice compared to optical sensors the most prominent advantage of sar is that it is not considerably affected by clouds and can identify river ice types several researchers have used the sar technique to extract the distribution and identify the types of river ice bernier and gauthier 2006 lindenschmidt et al 2011 jasek et al 2013 in addition the sar technology can be potentially used to retrieve the thickness of river ice lindenschmidt et al 2011 mermoz et al 2012 although reliable results have not been obtained yet notably most sar sensors have a low temporal resolution except for sentinel 1 which leads to a certain uncertainty in detecting break up dates or changes moreover the narrow coverage and data complexity of sar limit its applications in monitoring river ice on a large scale sentinel 1 has demonstrated promising application prospects due to its excellent spatial and temporal resolutions los and pawlowski 2017 and thus this method can likely be used to realize river ice monitoring however the existing studies mainly focused on monitoring the river ice at specific river reaches through visual interpretation and classification based on digital number values and thus the current methods cannot distinguish river ice and snow and monitor river ice on a large scale in addition only a few researchers attempted to monitor the river ice in high altitude mountain regions especially the tibetan plateau li et al 2020 first clarified the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of river ice at the basin scale on the tibetan plateau by using nearly twenty years of landsat images however this method cannot be applied on a large scale owing to limitations associated with the snow interference and regional terrain because of the complex terrain and climatic environment of the tibetan plateau the distribution features and patterns of river ice are unique and different from those in the arctic circle regions to monitor river ice on a large scale on the tibetan plateau we developed a relative difference river ice rdri identification method that can overcome interference from snow and other surrounding landscapes first we calibrated the optimal threshold of the method and determined other restrictions second we evaluated the monitoring accuracy of the method by using landsat and sentinel 2 images for different areas and dates third we compared the rdri and ndsi methods and analyzed their advantages and disadvantages 2 methods and data 2 1 study area the area of the tibetan plateau is 2 57 106 km2 and the mean elevation exceeds 4000 m the region includes abundant snow and glacial resources and river ice is widely distributed this plateau is a typical highly cold region with an average temperature annual of 4 0 c chen 2015 during the winter which lasts from october to may of the next year most areas have more than 30 d of snow cover huang et al 2017 most regions on this plateau have a dry climate low cloud cover low snow accumulation in the river valleys and a small amount of long term snow over the river ice the main types of rivers in this region are braided and canyon type rivers li et al 2016a this region mainly includes the upstream region of rivers with widths less than 1 km and the river discharge and widths are significantly smaller than those in the middle or lower reaches according to field investigations river ice is widely distributed in this high mountain region li et al 2009 we calibrated the threshold and validated the distinguishing ability of the rdri method on the northeastern tibetan plateau next we validated the accuracy of the rdri method at twelve sites over the tibetan plateau fig 1 considering the fact that river ice may involve certain differences in these basins we selected a typical site for validation in each basin and selected three validation sites in the inner basin largest basin the relevant information of these basins and distribution of the validation sites are presented in table 1 the precise location of the twelve validation sites was mainly determined by the actual distribution of the river ice notably the spatial resolution of the tibetan plateau dem data is 90 m tibetan plateau science data center 2 2 methods 2 2 1 rdri method the rdri method is based on the reflectivity difference between the red and near infrared nir bands divided by the reflectivity sum of the nir and infrared swir1 bands which is a unique method for river ice detection the relevant formula is as follows 2 rdri r red r nir r nir r swir where rred rnir and rswir are the reflectivity values of the red nir and swir bands respectively the rdri method threshold must be calibrated when using this method when the rdri value is greater than the threshold it corresponds to river ice in particular the optimal rdri method threshold of river ice may vary in different regions due to the differences in the type and thickness of river ice an optimal threshold should be able to identify river ice and overcome any snow interference accurately the reflectivity difference in the red and nir bands of river ice is larger than that of snow and other entities which is the basis of the rdri method the sum of the reflectivity of snow in the nir and swir1 bands is greater than that of river ice which can be used to distinguish river ice and snow further the difference in the reflectivity of the red and nir bands divided by the sum of the reflectivity of the nir and swir1 bands can more effectively distinguish river snow and ice in addition several additional conditions must be considered to overcome the interference of water shadows and other surrounding landscapes the application of the rdri method requires red nir and swir bands although the band setting differs for different sensors for thematic mapper tm and enhanced thematic mapper etm data bands 3 red 4 nir and 5 swir1 are used to derive the rdri value for operational land imager oli data bands 4 red 5 nir and 6 swir1 are used to derive the rdri value for sentinel 2 data bands 4 red 8 nir and 11 swir1 are used to derive the rdri value we used the swir1 band instead of the swir2 band in this method because the reflectivity of river ice and snow is more stable in the swir1 band than that in the swir2 band the swir1 band is more widely applied than the swir2 band which is specifically designed for geological applications 2 2 2 calibration of the rdri method threshold the suitable rdri method threshold for river ice is calibrated based on the rdri value distribution statistic of river ice from the images a suitable threshold can identify river ice and eliminate the interference of snow cover and other surrounding landscapes first we selected a cloud free oli image january 13 2014 involving developed river ice and a certain amount of snow and calculated the rdri value of this image second we used the nir red and green bands to compose a false color image to highlight the river ice and identified the river ice through visual interpretation in this image the river ice and snow appeared in cyan blue and white respectively third according to the visual interpretation results of the river ice and rdri value of this image we estimated a suitable threshold at which river ice should be reliably identified based on the rdri method and this threshold large scale river ice monitoring could be realized to enhance the stability of the suitable threshold three typical areas with developed river ice containing thin ice and thick ice were selected to calibrate the suitable threshold we used the mean value of the three thresholds as the suitable rdri method threshold in this study which was calibrated in the three typical areas for higher precision a 15 m fusion image was used to visually interpret the river ice and the result was regarded as the true value information next the area ratio of the river ice area obtained using each rdri value to the visually interpreted river ice area was calculated when this ratio was equal to 1 the two areas were equal the rdri value could be regarded as the calibrated threshold for this area the mean value of the three calibrated thresholds could be considered to be the suitable threshold for the given images over the whole tibetan plateau to make the threshold more robust we additional used etm and tm images for the threshold calibration for these images the average value of the calibration value at five sites was selected as the threshold 2 2 3 accuracy evaluation index for the validation of the monitoring accuracy of the rdri method a confusion matrix was used to evaluate the agreement between the river ice obtained using the rdri method and visual interpretation considered to be true data in this case the confusion matrix technique is widely used to evaluate the error between the image classification results and real ground situations the precision of this method defined as khat was calculated based on the kappa analysis statistic congalton 1991 this statistic is an estimate of the kappa values between the real ground situation and remote sensing classification results this value is a measure of consistency or accuracy when khat is 80 40 80 or 40 the classification accuracy is high medium or low respectively khat can be calculated as follows 3 k hat n i 1 r x ii j 1 r x i x i n 2 j 1 r x i x i where n is the total number of pixels r is the number of rows in the matrix x ii is the number of observations in row i and column i and x i and x i are the marginal totals of row i and column i respectively the overall accuracy oa is defined as the ratio of the number of accurately classified pixels to the total number of pixels and oa can be calculated as follows 4 oa i 1 r x ii n 2 3 satellite images the satellite images that could be applied in this study were required to satisfy two requirements first the sensor was required to have the necessary band for the rdri method second the spatial resolution of the images was required to satisfy the river ice recognition requirements consequently considering the availability of images and the river ice size in this area we selected landsat and sentinel 2 images for this study the images were provided by the google earth engine platform https earthengine google com and were atmospherically corrected data were processed on this platform we selected cloud free images in the calibration and validation areas through visual identification 2 3 1 landsat imagery the following types of images from three landsat sensors were considered tm landsat 5 etm landsat 7 and oli landsat 8 the spatial resolution of the bands used is 30 m landsat 5 was launched on march 1 1984 and was inactivated on december 21 2011 landsat 7 was launched on april 15 1999 and is currently operating normally and landsat 8 was launched on february 11 2013 and is currently operating normally these satellites have a 16 d revisit period the band settings of the landsat sensors are as follows table 2 2 3 2 sentinel 2 imagery sentinel 2 includes two satellites the first and second satellites sentinel 2a and sentinel 2b were launched on june 23 2015 and march 07 2017 respectively sentinel 2 is a high resolution multispectral imaging satellite that carries a multispectral imager msi for land monitoring the msi has an altitude of 786 km which covers 13 spectral bands with a width of 290 km table 3 the ground resolutions are 10 m 20 m and 60 m the revisit period of one satellite is ten days and the revisit period of the two complementary satellites is five days 2 4 validation of the rdri method first we validated the ability of the rdri method to distinguish river ice from other surrounding landscapes through the measured spectral data and remote sensing images oli involving river ice in a typical area on the northeastern tibetan plateau second we validated the monitoring accuracy of the rdri method at two scales including specific sites and pixels over the tibetan plateau 2 4 1 rdri ability for ice snow discrimination using in situ data to validate that the rdri can distinguish river ice from the surrounding landscape we used the measured spectral curve of river ice and other ground features in the field the measured spectral data can accurately provide the spectral characteristics of different types of river ice in all wavebands and serve as reference for the determination of the rdri threshold the measured spectral data are not affected by atmospheric factors we chose different types of river ice for measurement and obtained images of the river ice texture we measured the reflectivity of river ice and snow at a local time of 12 pm by using the psr 3500 spectrometer the reflectivity curves of the river ice and snow cover could be generated using the measured reflectivity data of the full spectrum finally we chose several spectral curves of river ice with different surfaces and calculated the rdri value for further comparison and use in the rdri threshold test moreover we measured the spectral curve of snow for comparison with that of the river ice 2 4 2 rdri ability for ice snow discrimination by using the oli image the oli is a high performance sensor that can help define the spectral reflectivity of river ice in the commonly used bands of multispectral sensors we selected an oli image january 13 2014 to validate the ability of the rdri method to distinguish river ice from the surrounding landscape in the image the remote sensing image was affected by atmospheric factors the selected image included river ice and other typical ground features in the study area such as snow and soil first we used a 543 band synthesis image to highlight the differences in the images between river ice and other ground features second we selected the sample areas of the ground features in the image to compare their reflectivity in each band oli finally we calculated the rdri values of each ground feature for validation 2 4 3 evaluation of the rdri accuracy over different ice forms we validated the monitoring accuracy of the rdri method at twelve different sites over the whole tibetan plateau by using oli etm and tm images moreover we validated the monitoring accuracy of the rdri method on different dates on the northeastern tibetan plateau by using sentinel 2 images the images were dated from january to march river ice development period and the validation sites were visually inspected to ensure cloud free conditions the detailed imaging time of each image is marked in figs 5 8 we attempted to choose sites involving developed river ice in different spatial distribution forms such as the wide accumulation wide dispersion and main channel types and validated the monitoring accuracy of the rdri method by using the visual interpretation results of river ice it was considered that if the monitoring accuracy of the rdri method based on the calibrated threshold satisfied the requirements the rdri method and this threshold could be used to extract river ice on a large scale in the considered region 2 4 4 evaluation of the rdri accuracy at selected pixels we validated the monitoring accuracy of the rdri method at several pixels over the whole tibetan plateau by using the oli images the image used for validation was the mean value image generated by the oli images with a cloud cover of less than 20 from january to march 2018 the location of the pixels was determined considering the different basins and topography of the entire tibetan plateau the comprehensiveness and rationality of the pixel positions were taken into account the pixels covered the river ice range in this region adequate to validate the effectiveness of the rdri method considering the inhomogeneous and discontinuous distribution of river ice we adopted two schemes to select the accuracy validation pixels fig 1 first certain validation pixels were arranged on the river channel in the study area green second the validation pixels were directly arranged in the study area without river regions red the minimum number of sampling points required for testing was determined using the fellow formula edwards et al 1998 5 n u 1 a 2 2 d 2 p 1 p where n is the minimum number of sampling points p is the percentage of points pertaining to correct classifications at specific sites u is the value corresponding to the confidence level from the probability table of the normal distribution d is the allowable range of error and a is set according to the accuracy requirements after determining the number and position of pixels we manually checked the classification accuracy of each pixel 3 results 3 1 rdri threshold calibration the calibration areas of the oli images included the hexi and yellow basins the rivers in the hexi basin are inland rivers and the selected calibration area was a typical inland river channel the river in the yellow basin is an exoreic river and the chosen calibration areas were typical exoreic river channels in general the distribution form and characteristics of the river ice in these areas are typical and representative moreover the spectral reflectivity of the river ice was measured in the hexi basin according to the visual interpretation results of the river ice at sites o1 o2 and o3 fig 2 we calibrated the proper threshold of the rdri method to monitor the river ice in this area corresponding to an rdri value 0 13 furthermore to eliminate the interference from water bodies and shadows we added conditions of rnir 0 10 which referenced the ndsi and rred rnir 0 068 as obtained from the shadow reflectivity statistics the three calibration sites were typical river ice development areas that represented different predominant distribution shapes of river ice such as the wide accumulation type o1 wide dispersion type o2 and main channel type o3 at the three sites when the area ratio extracted and interpreted areas of the river ice was equivalent to 1 the rdri values were 0 149 0 119 and 0 132 fig 2 the average value of the three calibrated thresholds for the three sites was 0 13 in addition the suitable threshold of the tm and etm images was determined to 0 13 by using the same process fig 2 calibrating the rdri method threshold is critical to extract river ice accurately when the rdri method is used in other regions the threshold may need to be recalibrated an extremely low or high rdri method threshold may result in the overestimation or underestimation of the river ice area respectively 3 2 validation of the ability of the rdri method to discriminate river ice and land the spectral reflectivity of the river ice obtained from the measured data and oli image were validated to ensure that the rdri method could distinguish river ice and overcome the interference of other surrounding landscapes including soil rocks and hay the rdri values of river ice obtained from field measurements and the image were larger than 0 27 and 0 54 respectively both values were within the calibrated threshold 0 13 the difference in the rdri value between the image and measured data could be attributed to the influence of the atmosphere sensor performance and algorithms employed in satellite data processing 3 2 1 use of the measured data the validation results of field measurements showed that the rdri method could effectively monitor the river ice and overcome interference from other surrounding landscapes fig 3 five typical spectral curves of river ice and snow and spectral curves of soil dry grass and water were selected to highlight the differences in the spectral characteristics the reflectivity difference in the red and nir bands of river ice was larger than that in the other bands this result was consistent with the simulation results the albedo of ice in the nir band 760 60 nm was significantly lower than that of snow according to the snow radiation transfer simulation liang et al 2017 as the river ice transparency increased the river ice reflectivity decreased in the red band although it did not change considerably in the nir band although the spectral features of river ice and snow are similar the reflectivity difference in the red and nir bands of river ice was larger than that of snow fig 3 the reflectivity difference for the river ice was larger than 0 17 but the reflectivity difference of snow 1 was 0 13 the values for snow 2 and snow 3 were smaller in addition the sum of the reflectivity values for the nir and swir1 bands of river ice was smaller than that of snow the value for river ice was less than 0 71 but that of snow 1 was 0 78 the values for snow 2 and snow 3 were larger the rdri values of river ice were larger than 0 27 and those for snow were 0 17 in addition the differences in the reflectivity pertaining to the red and nir bands of soil and dry grass were less than zero and the rdri method did not misjudge these entities the additional condition of rnir 0 10 could help avoid water interference 3 2 2 use of oli images the results showed that the rdri method could clearly distinguish river ice by considering the river ice spectral characteristics in the oli images and overcoming the impact of snow and soil in the oli 543 band synthetic image the river ice and snow appeared in cyan blue and white respectively fig 4 a the soil appeared in brown and was thus distinct from the river ice and snow we chose the typical river ice snow and soil areas to determine the mean reflectivity curves the reflectivity curves of the selected river ice snow and soil areas in each band of the oli sensor are shown in fig 4b the difference in the red and nir reflectivity of river ice was greater than that of snow the value for river ice was greater than 0 27 and that for snow was smaller than 0 01 table 4 moreover the sum of the reflectivity values in the nir and swir1 bands of river ice was smaller than that for snow the value for river ice was smaller than 0 50 and that for snow was larger than 0 72 the rdri value for the selected river ice region was larger than 0 54 although that of the selected snow region was smaller than 0 01 the spectral curve of soil showed that the rdri value of soil was less than zero and thus the soil did not interfere in the river ice extraction based on the rdri method 3 3 validation of the rdri method monitoring accuracy 3 3 1 use of the oli images at specific sites the validation results showed that the river ice could be accurately extracted using the oli images and the rdri method with the calibrated threshold 0 13 at the twelve validation sites a b c d e f g h i j k and l the oli images and extracted river ice from each site are shown in fig 5 compared with the visual interpretation results the rdri method could accurately extract river ice with only a few misjudgments and slight omissions for thin ice or scattered river ice the rdri method did not misclassify snow as river ice at the twelve validation sites the mean oa and khat were 99 81 and 0 97 respectively at validation sites a b g and j river ice was concentrated and the missed river ice was thin ice or river ice with water underneath at validation sites c d and e the terrain was flat and the missed river ice was mainly scattered thin ice validation sites f and l were typical braided river channels with relatively developed and scattered thin ice which corresponded to the omissions validation site h was a typical mountain dendritic drainage site with concentrated river ice a small amount of liquid water and lower omissions with a khat value of 0 9959 at validation sites i and k river ice was sporadically distributed in the high mountain area and the river ice that was missed was mainly thin ice excessively thin river ice may be missed when using the rdri method due to its low reflectivity in the visual or red bands 3 3 2 use of etm images at specific sites the validation results showed that the river ice could be accurately extracted using the etm images and rdri method with the calibrated threshold 0 13 at the twelve validation sites a b c d e f g h i j k and l the etm images and extracted river ice from each area are shown in fig 6 at most validation sites the rdri method extracted river ice was highly consistent with the results of the visual interpretation except at validation site f the mean oa and khat were 99 83 and 0 94 respectively except those at validation site k at validation sites a and b river ice was concentrated these cases corresponded to high classification accuracy and the missed river ice was thin ice or river ice with water underneath at validation sites c d and g river ice was relatively concentrated in the main channel and dispersed along the shore at validation sites e f i j and l the missed river ice was scattered and thin ice the classification errors corresponded mainly to river ice omission excessively thin river ice may be missed when using the rdri method due to its low reflectivity in the visual or red bands validation site h was a typical mountain dendritic drainage site with a high classification accuracy and the khat was 0 9956 at validation site k the etm image before sensor malfunction required excessive radiometric correction which led to the snow cover being was erroneously classified as river ice the main reason for the low accuracy for validation site k was the inferior image quality 3 3 3 use of tm images at specific sites the validation results showed that the river ice could be accurately extracted using the tm images and rdri method with the calibrated threshold 0 13 at the twelve validation sites a b c d e f g h i j k and l the tm images and extracted river ice from each site are shown in fig 7 the river ice extracted using the rdri method was highly consistent with the results of the visual interpretation the mean oa and khat were 99 88 and 0 95 respectively at validation sites a b c and d the river ice was thick and concentrated and corresponded to high classification accuracy at validation sites e f and l scattered thin river ice was distributed in the braided river channel and misjudgments occurred validation site h was a typical mountain dendritic drainage site with thick river ice and corresponded to high accuracy at validation sites i and k river ice was sporadically distributed in the high mountain area and the missed river ice was mainly thin ice the rdri method did not misclassify snow as river ice at validation site k in general the main reason for misclassification may be the insufficient spatial resolution of the image in addition river ice that is excessively thin may be missed when using the rdri method due to its low reflectivity in the visual or red bands especially at validation site f 3 3 4 use of sentinel 2 images of different dates the validation results showed that the river ice could be extracted using the sentinel 2 data and rdri method on the nine validation dates a b c d e f g h and i the sentinel 2 images and extracted river ice for each date are shown in fig 8 the images indicated the occurrence of river ice accumulation and gradual melting in this river reach the images from dates a to e and dates f to i corresponded to the accumulation period and melting period respectively in general the rdri method successfully extracted the river ice and the results were highly consistent with those of visual interpretation the mean oa and khat were 99 86 and 0 97 respectively the missed river ice was mainly thin ice and the river ice was covered with water the excessively thin river ice may be missed when using the rdri method due to its low reflectivity in the visual or red bands the river ice was thick and concentrated on dates a and c and corresponded to a high classification accuracy the missed river ice was mainly thin ice and the khat values were 0 9988 and 0 9948 respectively on dates b and d the river ice was covered with thick snow the rdri method did not entirely detect the river ice although it could distinguish the river ice and snow on date e the river ice reached the maximum thickness and corresponded to high classification accuracy with khat being 0 9977 from dates f to i the amount of liquid water on the surface of the river ice increased with the melting of the river ice which led to a decrease in reflectivity in the red band and caused certain river ice omissions therefore the classification accuracy of the river ice decreased significantly on dates h and i 3 3 5 consideration of pixels over the tibetan plateau the minimum number of sampling points was calculated using formula 3 and the mean oa at different sites was 99 88 we determined that the p value was 0 99 for a 0 01 that is the confidence level was 99 according to the table u 2 58 and the error allowed range was d 1 therefore n 659 we determined that the numbers of validation pixels on the river and those selected without considering the river channel were 670 and 697 respectively leading to 1328 total pixels we manually checked the classification accuracy of each pixel in terms of the validation accuracy for the whole tibetan plateau oa and kappa were 99 41 and 0 8828 respectively table 5 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of rdri and ndsi the rdri method can be used to detect river ice by considering the difference in the reflectivity in the red and nir bands divided by the sum of the reflectivity values for the nir and swir bands the rdri method can distinguish river ice and snow cover by considering the spectral differences between the two entities figs 3 and 4 however the ndsi method cannot distinguish river ice and snow cover the ndsi was designed to distinguish snow and land but not to differentiate between river ice and snow li et al 2020 used the maximum distribution range of the river ice to exclude snow cover in their study while the maximum distribution range was visually determined by combining images river systems and dem data such methods cannot be used on a large scale on the tibetan plateau and thus it was necessary to develop a method that can distinguish river ice and snow cover the ndsi method considers the spectral similarity between snow and ice the similarity between the rdri and ndsi methods is that both methods consider the difference in the reflectivity in specific bands divided by the sum of the specific band reflectivity and thus both rdri and ndsi methods correspond to ratio methods in addition both methods consider a nir band reflectivity of more than 0 1 to eliminate interference from water bodies due to the complex alpine terrain on the tibetan plateau shadow interference commonly occurs the rdri method considers a difference of more than 0 068 in the reflectivity in the red and nir bands to eliminate mountain shadow interference generally sensors with red nir and swir bands can be used to employ the rdri method in terms of river ice monitoring the advantage of the rdri method is that it can separate river ice from snow cover to highlight the difference in the extraction results of the two methods we chose an area involving both river ice and snow and zoomed it for a clear illustration fig 9 in the oli 543 band synthetic images the river ice and snow appear as cyan and white respectively fig 9a the extraction targets of the rdri and ndsi methods are the cyan part ice and cyan and white parts snow and ice respectively as shown in fig 9b river ice and snow were extracted without any notable difference thus the river ice and snow were mixed and could not be separated as shown in fig 9c only river ice was extracted and snow was not included to quantitatively compare the rdri and ndsi methods in terms of the river ice extraction we simultaneously extracted the river ice and calculated its area using the two methods in the comparison area fig 9d the results showed that the river ice areas extracted using the rdri and ndsi methods were 2 7299 km2 and 2 7194 km2 respectively the oa values of the rdri and ndsi methods were 93 19 and 92 83 respectively the similarity of the two areas was 99 6 which indicated that the two methods have a similar ability to extract river ice in the absence of any snow disturbance in cold regions river ice and snow simultaneously exist and in such scenarios the rdri method can be used to monitor river ice on a large scale accurately notably the rdri method cannot detect river ice when it is covered with thick snow as shown in fig 5f 7f 8b and 8d 4 2 applications the rdri method can be used to monitor river ice by using optical imagery on a large scale on the tibetan plateau this method is particularly applicable to this plateau which has a low latitude dry climate and low snow coverage this method can extract river ice by using landsat and sentinel 2 imagery and separate river ice from snow cover thereby serving as a useful tool to monitor the distribution range and characteristics of river ice on the tibetan plateau at present the ice in gullies or low lying areas in the tibetan plateau is considered part of the river ice because the tibetan plateau is mainly a mountainous region with complex terrain most of the ice is expected to sink in the river as it melts in addition due to the spatial resolution of the tibetan plateau river channel data and the easy deformation of the river channels it is difficult to accurately distinguish river ice from ice in gullies or low lying areas to reduce the threshold deviation we adopted the average rdri threshold of the three sites as the appropriate threshold for the study area the three sites were typical river ice development areas that represented different predominant distribution shapes of river ice to validate the monitoring accuracy of the rdri method we selected different types of river ice at different locations and elevations for comparative analysis highly accurate results were obtained among the different forms of river ice more concentrated and thicker river ice sites a and b could be more accurately monitored than more discrete and thin ice sites f h i and k in addition the topography and elevation did not influence the river ice monitoring the rdri value range pertaining to the measured reflectivity was different from the image reflectivity likely because of the atmospheric effects table 4 furthermore we used an oli image to examine the influence of the atmosphere on the rdri values text s3 the results showed that the atmospheric conditions did influence the rdri value and thus atmospheric corrections must be performed before using this method in addition the differences in the sensors used in this study likely influenced the rdri value and threshold although the validation accuracy indicated that it is not necessary to calibrate the threshold using each sensor at present notably when monitoring river ice by using the rdri method at a large scale on the tibetan plateau the results may also include lake ice and glaciers which must be eliminated lake ice has similar spectral characteristics as river ice owing to the similar physical structures of these entities thus the proposed method can also be used to monitor lake ice to enable a clear comparison between lake ice and river ice we used oli and modis images to monitor lake ice text s1 in addition certain glacier tongues have spectral characteristics similar to those of ice we selected a typical glacier area in this region as an example and the monitoring results obtained using the rdri and ndsi methods are presented in text s2 limitations this study was focused on introducing the rdri method and the elimination of cloud interference was not considered cloud disturbance is a common influential factor when using optical images the influence of clouds may partially limit the application of the rdri method and this aspect must be considered in future work moreover snow cover may hinder the extraction of river ice information and result in the omission of river ice when the river ice is covered by thick snow thicker than approximately 2 3 cm the rdri method cannot detect river ice the application of this method may thus be limited in areas with heavy snow cover such as the arctic circle therefore the selection of images with heavy snowfall must be avoided when monitoring river ice by using the rdri method in addition river ice that is excessively thin may be missed when using the rdri method due to its low reflectivity in the visual or red bands during the melting period meltwater appears on the surface of the river ice which significantly reduces the reflectivity of the nir band and leads to the omission of river ice this phenomenon occurred for the sentinel 2 validation dates h and i as described in section 3 4 fig 8 which led to a slight decrease in classification accuracy river ice may also exist in the shadow area of the mountain which may be monitored using a combination of two sensors at different crossing times to reduce omission when perform river ice and lake ice monitoring in other areas the rdri method threshold may need to be recalibrated because no field observations of river ice are available for this region it is difficult to validate the monitoring results using field observations directly the differences in sensor performance season temperature and atmosphere may influence the rdri values the limitations of this study also include the low temporal and spatial resolution of the landsat imagery owing to the temporal resolution of the images it is difficult to accurately monitor the freezing and melting of rivers using landsat images although joint monitoring using multiple sensors may help increase the temporal resolution the landsat and sentinel 2 images are suitable for the sizes of the river ice in this area in general owing to the limited spatial resolution of the landsat 8 imagery 30 m narrow river ice may be missed therefore the river ice area obtained in this study was slightly underestimated although the etm has a strip problem that affects the calculation of the river ice area it can provide useful data for monitoring the historical freezing and melting of rivers chen et al 2011 because of the low spatial resolution moderate spatial resolution 0 25 1 km sensor images are insufficient to monitor the river ice in this region 5 conclusions to perform river ice monitoring using remote sensing on a large scale on the tibetan plateau we proposed the rdri method that considers the difference in the reflectivity in the red and nir bands of river ice and other surrounding landscapes we suggest a threshold rdri value 0 13 for monitoring river ice on the tibetan plateau the measured spectral data and oli images demonstrated that the rdri method could effectively distinguish river ice and other surrounding landscapes and the monitoring accuracy at different sites and dates reached 0 94 mean khat compared with the traditional ndsi algorithm the advantage of the rdri method is that it can separate river ice from snow and other surrounding landscapes the accuracy of the two methods for river ice monitoring was similar in the absence of snow disturbance this method can be applied using current multispectral sensors such as landsat tm etm oli and sentinel 2 images no significant difference can be observed among the monitoring results obtained through these sensors the differences in sensor performance season temperature and atmosphere may influence the rdri method values generally the surrounding topography and elevation do not impact the river ice monitoring among different forms of river ice more concentrated and thicker river ice can be more accurately monitored than discrete and thin ice this method is suitable for the tibetan plateau which has a dry climate and low snow cover notably the rdri method cannot detect river ice underneath thick snow in addition the rdri method can likely monitor lake ice because lake ice and river ice have similar spectral characteristics to perform lake ice monitoring or river ice monitoring in other areas the rdri method threshold may need to be recalibrated the rdri method can facilitate the large scale monitoring of river ice on the tibetan plateau the area of river ice on the whole tibetan plateau can be monitored using this method and the results can provide support for regional water resource management and cryosphere research credit authorship contribution statement

4284,runoff and baseflow estimates provide critical information on surface and groundwater flow dynamics water resource availability and water usage patterns for effective water resource planning and management developing a physical based model at large spatial scales such as continental global scales require extensive datasets complex parameterization and higher computational capacity recent advances in satellite datasets related to water cycle process modeling on the other hand involve less parameterization and more effective computation over larger spatial and finer temporal scales evapotranspiration et is a critical flux in the water cycle that can be estimated with reasonable accuracy from satellite based information by using complementary relationship cr concepts similarly the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission satellite datasets provide useful estimates of total water storage change over large spatial extents grace datasets have been extensively used in groundwater storage change and groundwater depletion studies however the application of grace data products for estimating runoff and baseflow is limited therefore in this study we used a cr approach to estimate et and a water balance method for estimating runoff and baseflow over the conterminous united states conus we evaluated the cr based water balance model cr grace with united states geological survey usgs runoff datasets based on hydrologic unit code level 2 huc 2 basin boundaries the cr grace model estimated annual runoff values agreed with usgs runoff values with root mean square error rmse and correlation coefficient values of 14 7 mm month and 0 81 respectively we also evaluated the cr grace model with two well known land surface models lsm noah lsm and variable infiltration capacity lsm vic lsm from the global land data assimilation system gldas database the comparison results for baseflow estimates from the cr grace model have improved over noah lsm and vic lsm model estimates with rmse values of 62 16 101 00 and 207 32 mm year respectively furthermore this study demonstrates the feasibility of using the cr grace model to estimate runoff and baseflows with limited parameterization and datasets keywords complementary relationship grace evapotranspiration baseflow runoff water balance equation script availability statement the developed r scripts for estimating long term runoff and baseflow grids are provided in the following github repository https github com mohanasundaram1986 baseflow git 1 introduction river discharge or runoff and baseflow i e a portion of runoff measurements provide useful information for water resources planning basin scale water budgeting and watershed modelling runoff in a basin is influenced by meteorological factors such as intensity of rainfall duration of rainfall amount of rainfall type of precipitation distribution of rainfall over the basin and other meteorological factors affecting evapotranspiration et such as temperature wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity dingman 2002 runoff is also inherently influenced by physical characteristics of the basin such as vegetation land use soil types soil characteristics topography elevation and size and shape of the basin similarly baseflow to the rivers and streams is influenced by underlying geology soil topography rainfall land cover groundwater table recharge and discharge mechanisms zhang and schilling 2006 aksoy and wittenberg 2011 however runoff is generally measured at specific locations in the basins by manual or automatic gauging stations while baseflow is usually estimated from streamflow with baseflow separation methods which is again limited to the specific sites where runoff is being measured the sparse distribution of measurement sites and intermittent observations restrict the application of spatial distribution of runoff and baseflow estimates for the effective management of surface and groundwater resources at a basin scale the water balance equation at region scale or watershed scale can be written as precipitation equals to a sum of et runoff and change in total water storage components nowadays reliable precipitation datasets across the globe are reasonably available with moderate spatial and temporal resolutions the et process involves a complex interaction with the atmosphere soil and crop parameters parametric process based et models typically require intensive datasets such as soil crop and climatic data to derive et at different spatial scales with reasonable accuracy droogers 2000 salama et al 2015 li et al 2016a tegos et al 2017 but remote sensing based methods have the advantage of estimating hydrological fluxes such as et from routinely available weather parameters without actually integrating intensive and complex land use crop and soil parameters anayah and kaluarachchi 2014 ma et al 2015 gao et al 2018 the complementary relationship cr based et estimation methods are widely used for assessing et at catchment regional scales anayah and kaluarachchi 2014 satellite derived input gridded datasets such as temperature relative humidity and radiation are mainly used to derive cr based et fluxes hobbins et al 2001a 2001b 2001c xu and singh 2005 szilagyi and jozsa 2009 mcmahon et al 2013 shanmugam et al 2020 the complementary relationship areal evapotranspiration crae model has been developed explicitly for estimating et for landscape environment morton 1983 morton et al 1985 shanmugam et al 2020 the robust validation of cr based annual average et fluxes against the water balance data shows the significance of remote sensing based et estimation methods for practical applications hobbins et al 2001a 2001b 2001c szilagyi 2015 shanmugam et al 2020 the runoff component can be modelled by a physical based distributed modeling approach at different spatial and time scales jaiswal et al 2020 villa alvarado et al 2014 paniconi and putti 2015 reggiani and schellekens 2006 devia et al 2015 however physical based runoff modeling methods require intensive input datasets and a calibration process against observed runoff datasets the physical based modelling process is demanding on many occasions where the observations are limited or discontinuous due to missing data moreover the process based models have certain limitations to computational capacity over large spatial scales such as regional or continental global scales for these reasons remote sensing based spatial datasets play an inevitable role in spatial monitoring and modelling processes chen et al 2021 luo et al 2021 singh jasrotia et al 2021 wasko et al 2021 gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission dataset is one such a remote sensed data product that can be applied for several hydrological applications including runoff estimation from relatively larger basins the change in the terrestrial gravitational field is converted into estimates of change in the terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa using spherical harmonic coefficients and a series of post processing procedures for hydrological applications landerer and swenson 2012 the twsa datasets represent the equivalent depth of water in canopy rivers lakes snow cover soil moisture and groundwater the twsa is also a deviation from the baseline average values and the average baseline period is typically from 2004 to 2009 in the grace mission datasets although grace datasets are available at coarser spatial scales i e 3 or 300 km the application of grace datasets on medium spatial scales watersheds i e 50 000 km2 also demonstrated that the water balance calculation from grace is in good agreement with hydrological model outputs and in situ runoff observations biancamaria et al 2019 some applications of grace datasets include long term trend analysis of twsa along with local and regional climate and land use drivers yang et al 2017 seyoum 2018 hasan and tarhule 2020 wei et al 2021 xiong et al 2021 global land data assimilation system gldas datasets were developed from compiling ground and satellite based observations using sophisticated land surface models lsm that produce surface and subsurface fluxes such as et runoff and baseflow rodell et al 2004 some studies have used twsa datasets along with gldas lsm simulated fluxes such as et in the regional water balance equations to retrieve runoff at different catchment scales syed et al 2009 li et al 2012 2016b sridhar et al 2019 hu et al 2021 however very limited studies have focused on retrieving gridded runoff using grace and gldas datasets at national continental scales moreover a combination of independent cr based et estimates with the application of twsa datasets in the regional water balance equation to retrieve gridded runoff over national continental scales approach is never attempted to our best knowledge baseflow is often separated indirectly from streamflow records many studies have separated baseflow components from runoff records rutledge 1992 stewart et al 2007 risser et al 2009 the automated web based hydrograph method separates baseflow from runoff time series data zomlot et al 2015 the comparison between different baseflow separation methods such as part rutledge 2007a 2007b rora rutledge 2007b base flow index wahl and wahl 2001 and what lim et al 2004 show that many of them correlate closely with each other in terms of their output performance combalicer et al 2008 eckhardt 2008 the baseflow index bfi describes the ratio of baseflow to the total streamflow or runoff this index is often used to calculate the baseflow which is assumed to be approximately equal to base recharge in the regional water balance equations szilagyi et al 2003 but the base recharge and the total recharge differ slightly in quantity when there is less or no extraction of groundwater by vegetation in contrast the difference in total recharge and base recharge might be significant in quantity when there is a considerable consumption of groundwater by the vegetation which occurs in the riparian zones szilagyi et al 2005 regional scale annual average baseflow estimation using baseflow separation methods has some limitations in that these methods calculate the bfi and baseflow values at runoff measuring sites these point values of baseflow estimates adopt some interpolation methods to create spatial baseflow grids this limitation can be addressed by first integrating remote sensing derived hydrological fluxes such as cr derived et and grace based twsa datasets into the regional water balance equation cr grace to obtain spatially distributed annual average runoff fluxes secondly the regional scale annual average baseflow can be derived from cr grace runoff and bfi gridded maps furthermore the evaluation of remote sensing and grace based baseflow estimates can be compared with gldas lsm derived baseflow grids at similar spatial and temporal scales the present study aims to retrieve monthly gridded runoff and baseflow from cr grace based water balance approach over continental scale this study also evaluates the performance of the cr grace model baseflow estimates against two selected lsm noah lsm and vic lsm baseflow estimates the specific objectives of this study are 1 estimating monthly evapotranspiration from grid based cr model 2 developing monthly runoff grids from cr grace approach 3 estimating baseflow grids from bfi and runoff grids and 4 evaluating the performance of cr grace model baseflow estimates against gldas based noah lsm and vic lsm model baseflow estimates 2 methodology and data 2 1 study area the conterminous united states conus was selected as the study area in the present study fig 1 the latitude and longitude coverage of conus ranges from 24 n to 50 n and 66 15 w to 125 w the elevation in the western zones of conus ranges up to 3800 m while the elevation varies less than 100 m in the southeastern zones of the conus fig 1 the entire conus is divided and subdivided into different hydrological units the first classification level divides the entire conus into 18 major geographic areas also named hydrological unit code 2 level basins huc 2 the huc 2 regions are delineated based on the drainage area of the major river systems in the conus in the western zones of the conus the two major river systems include the colorado river in the southwest and the columbia river in the northwest the largest conus river system is the missouri river system huc 2 unit 10 in fig 1 which feeds into the mississippi river the physical characteristics of conus are extremely diverse ranging from mountainous regions in the west to flat terrain in the east and temperate rainforest to arid deserts the most variable climates in the conus occur in the center of the country near north dakota where the extreme temperatures have ranged between 49 and 51 c during summer and winter months respectively whereas in the west california oregon and washington are influenced by pacific coastal climates and the difference between summer and winter seasons climate is marginal oehser et al 2020 the precipitation patterns also vary across conus the pacific coastal range forms a rain shadow dividing the climate on the western side and the eastern side of the mountains the rain shadows continue eastward towards the rocky mountains creating arid to semi arid climates in the intermontane zones in the extreme east humidity increases as moist and unstable air drifts from the gulf of mexico producing more precipitation than the pacific and open atlantic oceans the annual average precipitation from the last decade over the conus is about 767 mm year while the highest and lowest statewide average precipitation received is 1528 mm year and 248 mm year in louisiana and nevada respectively the annual average et varies from 200 mm year in some western states such as nevada and arizona to 4000 mm year in some southeastern states such as alabama mississippi and louisiana reitz et al 2017 the usgs groundwater and streamflow information programs support monitoring and collecting streamflow and water level at around 8500 sites this data is available online for several needs such as flood warnings water allocation monitoring environmental conditions power production and recreational activities u s geological survey 2020 national streamflow networks nsn and federal priority stream gauges fps consist of all stream gauges that continuously monitor streamflow the nsn alone monitors 8200 gauges and fps monitors around 3600 gauges the principal aquifers in the united states include the floridan aquifer systems in southeastern conus composed of productive limestone and the northern atlantic coastal plain aquifer system composed of semi consolidated sands reilley et al 2008 the usgs also monitors groundwater withdrawals for several sectors including agriculture municipal and industries ninety percent of the groundwater withdrawal for these three sectors comes from 20 principal aquifers in the united states reilley et al 2008 2 2 grace and grace fo datasets grace mission

terrestrial water storage on land and ocean landerer et al 2020 the specific datasets used in this study is the gridded monthly water storage depth anomalies from jet propulsion laboratory jpl grace and grace fo mascon ocean ice and hydrology equivalent water height coastal resolution improvement cri filtered datasets with the release 06 and version 02 jpl rl06 v02 https podaac jpl nasa gov grace sections about 2bdata the jpl rl06 v02 surface mass change grids are available at 0 5 which is approximately equal to 56 km the temporal coverage of this dataset is from april 2002 to june 2020 at a monthly interval watkins et al 2015 wiese et al 2018 however we extracted the monthly grids from january 2004 to december 2010 to avoid missing data between 2002 and 2004 and after 2010 and to ensure continuity in the time series data this data in network common data form netcdf files were processed into independent monthly grids in the r package r core team 2013 2 3 ncep narr climatic and radiation datasets climatic parameters including precipitation dew point temperature and mean air temperature was retrieved from national centers for environmental prediction ncep north american regional reanalysis narr data products ncep narr 2005 over the period of 2004 to 2010 all ncep narr datasets were in wgs 1984 lambert conformal conic projection coordinate systems with a spatial resolution of 0 3 i e 32 km the accumulated total precipitation variable in kg m2 was converted to monthly precipitation in mm monthly dew point temperature and mean air temperature at 2 m height above the surface in k were converted to c radiation datasets including downward shortwave radiation flux dsrf downward longwave radiation flux dlrf upward shortwave radiation flux usrf and upward longwave radiation flux ulrf at a monthly time interval from january 2004 to december 2010 were retrieved from ncep narr as net radiation at the soil plant interface is a critical parameter in the calculation of et from the grid based complementary relationship areal evapotranspiration py crae model shanmugam et al 2020 this flux was calculated based on surface level dsrf dlrf usrf and ulrf fluxes as follows 1 n rad dsrf d l r f usrf u l r f where n rad is the net radiation flux at the surface in w m2 2 4 usgs runoff and baseflow datasets the streamflow runoff or runoff values calculated over huc 2 were retrieved from the usgs waterwatch website http waterwatch usgs gov the huc 2 runoff is calculated based on historical streamflow from stream gauges huc 2 boundaries and stream gauge based drainage basins in this study we used huc 2 level runoff values as they represent relatively larger spatial extents within the conus boundary in total there were 18 units of huc 2 basins the spatial extent of these huc 2 basins ranges from 105 949 km2 to 783 066 km2 fig 1 these huc 2 basins spatial extents can be conveniently compared to grace data products original spatial resolutions of 300 300 km the huc 2 monthly runoff values were retrieved from 2004 to 2010 also we retrieved the gridded bfi map from the department of the interior us general service administration data gov portal https catalog data gov dataset base flow index grid for the conterminous united states to compute baseflow grids the usgs based baseflow grids were calculated by multiplying the annual average bfi map with usgs runoff grids 2 5 gldas baseflow datasets we retrieved baseflow datasets from two lsm noah10 m and vic10 m from the gldas database over the period of 2004 2010 for comparison li et al 2020 beaudoing and rodell 2020 the spatial and temporal resolutions of these two lsm were 1 1 and monthly respectively as these model simulated baseflow datasets were in kg m2 3 hour accumulated units averaged over monthly time scales we converted these baseflow datasets to mm month units by multiplying with a factor of 240 2 6 methodology 2 6 1 spatially distributed evapotranspiration mapping using grid based py crae model actual et et can be estimated based on potential et etp and wet environment et etw using a complementary relationship bouchet 1963 the crae model estimates etp etw and et for the landscape environment morton 1983 the formulation for crae model et is as follows 2 e t 2 e tw e tp where all values are in mm potential et for eq 2 can be estimated by solving the energy balance and vapor transfer equations respectively for potential et and equilibrium temperatures as follows 3 e tp 1 λ r n γ p f t 4 ε σ t 273 3 t e t a 4 e tp 1 λ f t v e v d where r n is the net radiation for the soil plant surface at air temperature f t is the vapor transfer coefficient w m 2 mbar 1 γ is the psychrometric constant mbar c 1 p is the atmospheric pressure at the station mbar ε

temperature t e mbar v d is saturation vapour pressure at dew point temperature t d mbar λ is latent heat of vaporization w d kg 1 the wet environment areal et can be estimated using the priestley taylor equation priestley and taylor 1972 the formulation for etw is as follows 5 e tw b 1 b 2 1 γ p δ p r tp where r tp is the net radiation for the soil plant surface at te w m 2 δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve at t e mbar c 1 b 1 b 2 are empirical coefficients and the corresponding values are 14 w m 2 and 1 2 respectively mcmahon et al 2013 morton et al 1985 developed a computer program called wrevap to calculate point based et using weather station inputs the point estimated et values often adopt some interpolation approach to establish a spatially continuous et map over regional scales moreover the complicated part of the wrevap program is based on deriving the net radiation from weather inputs shanmugam et al 2020 developed a grid based et estimation model i e py crae to estimate et under heterogeneous surface conditions to overcome these issues in interpolating point estimates over spatial grids and the complex calculation of net radiation from weather station inputs the validity of the py crae model was extensively tested with water balance based et values from huc 8 level basins in the state of nebraska usa therefore in this study we adopted the same py crae model to estimate gridded et over the entire conus region the input datasets for the py crae model were gridded mean air temperature dewpoint temperature and net radiation that is computed using eq 1 the py crae model outputs were optimized t e at the soil plant surface r n at the soil plant surface etw etp and et the te for soil plant surface was optimized for each grid in the conus for every monthly time step using the iteration process the t e grids were the input to calculate the final r n for soil plant surface grids finally the monthly et grids were derived from etp and etw grids more detailed information about the py crae model including model scripts and input data requirements can be found in shanmugam et al 2020 2 6 2 terrestrial water storage change from grace datasets grace mascons jpl rl06 v02 netcdf files were converted to individual monthly grids these monthly grids represent the twsa in equivalent water thickness in cm units for the compatibility of units we converted these grids from cm units to mm units as other water cycle components such as precipitation and et were estimated in mm units for the compatibility of projections we converted all grids into the nad83 geographic coordinate system the original grace mean monthly twsa values represent mean values between two consecutive months and not the change between the first and last days of the month but the water cycle components such as precipitation et and runoff are typically estimated or aggregated at a monthly interval therefore the subsequent mean monthly twsa values from grace were converted to respective month change called terrestrial water storage change twsc by adopting a second order central differencing function using eq 6 as follows biancamaria et al 2019 6 twsc m twsa m 1 t w s a m 1 2 where twsc m is the value of twsc at month m twsa m 1 and twsa m 1 are successive and preceding m months values of twsa 2 6 3 gridded runoff estimation from grace and water balance equation the runoff from a catchment is measured at the stream gauge locations the site specific point observed runoff values are often used to calibrate and validate the hydrological and hydrodynamic models the hydrological and hydrodynamic model calibration requires intensive datasets on soil land cover topography slope characteristics and climatic variables that drive the whole system sometimes most of these input data for hydrological and hydrodynamic model calibrations come from satellite and reanalysis data products stisen et al 2008 liu et al 2012 however developing hydrological and hydrodynamic models integrating several processes at larger spatial scales is computationally intensive and subject to uncertainty in the estimates therefore in this study we modelled hydrological components independently and integrated them with a water balance equation the regional scale water balance equation can be written using eq 7 as follows 7 p e t r o t w s c where p is precipitation mm et is evapotranspiration mm ro is runoff mm twsc is total water storage change mm in eq 7 the precipitation and twsc were directly derived from ncep narr reanalysis and grace datasets respectively the et grids were estimated by the py crae model therefore the remaining unknown runoff component in eq 7 can be calculated using eq 8 as follows 8 ro p e t t w s c we resampled ncep narr precipitation and py crae et grids with respect to the twsa grid resolution to ensure compatibility in spatial scales across all datasets 2 6 4 baseflow estimation from gridded runoff and baseflow index baseflow is the contribution of groundwater flow to the streams and it can be separated from the streamflow hydrographs using filtering methods and computer programs eckhardt 2008 barlow et al 2015 sometimes the long term baseflow is approximately equated to base recharge lee et al 2006 szilagyi et al 2003 the long term base recharge or baseflow can be estimated using precipitation remote sensing derived et and bfi values using eq 9 as follows 9 bfi p e t b f i r o q b r b where q b is the baseflow mm year r b is the base recharge mm year eq 9 assumes that the twsc values with long term average temporal scales can be ignored due to their insignificant value however in the present study we accounted twsc component in the water balance equation while computing the baseflow component from total runoff and bfi grids therefore the formulation for baseflow estimation from runoff and bfi grids is provided in eq 10 as follows 10 bfi p e t t w s c b f i r o q b r b 2 6 5 comparison of model based gridded runoff and baseflow with usgs observation datasets the runoff grids were estimated from monthly precipitation et and twsc grids using eq 8 the mean monthly runoff grids were computed by aggregating and averaging the respective monthly runoff grids over the entire conus region from time series runoff grids furthermore the annual average runoff grids were calculated by summing all mean monthly runoff grids similarly the annual average baseflow grids were generated by multiplying the yearly average runoff grids with the yearly average bfi grid the yearly average runoff and baseflow grid values were averaged over huc 2 level basins to compare with the usgs runoff and baseflow datasets also the proposed cr grace model performance was evaluated against noah lsm and vic lsm baseflow estimates for the comparison purpose five model performance assessment indices root mean square error rmse relative bias percent rbp mean absolute percent error mape wilmott index of agreement wi and correlation coefficient r were computed using eqs 11 through 15 as follows 11 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 12 rbp i 1 n s i o i i 1 n o i 100 13 mape 1 n i 1 n o i s

o is mean value of the observations s is the mean value of the estimations n is the total number of observations 3 results and discussion 3 1 estimating et using the py crae model the estimated mean monthly et by the py crae model is shown in fig 2 the mean monthly et values were calculated from respective monthly images over the period of 2004 2010 it was observed that the estimated mean monthly et values were less than 25 mm month during the winter and spring seasons i e september to december and january to march while the extreme et values were estimated up to 250 mm month during june and july the critical factors influencing the variability in the et estimates include variations in the net radiation and soil moisture status the net radiation during the summer season is more acute than other months while the soil moisture status during these seasons from precipitation and irrigation practices is relatively higher than in any other months therefore the estimated et rates during the summer months were higher when compared to other months fig 2 the spatial distribution of et rates was higher over the mid western and the southern states of conus and especially the extreme et rates were estimated over the great lakes and its surrounding areas a substantial difference in the distribution of et rates during the summer months was observed among some of the western states of conus for example the western coastal states such as washington oregon and central and north of california were showing relatively higher et rates up to 150 mm month while the other western states specifically arizona utah nevada and southern california were showing et rates less than 50 mm month the lower et rates in the southwestern regions were mainly due to dry soil and less moisture availability as these regions belong to two major deserts of the mojave and sonoran deserts annual average et rates in the conus region are shown in fig 3 the extreme et rates with a range of 750 950 mm year were observed in coastal oregon washington and california similarly the southern coastal borders of texas and louisiana also showed extreme et rates with a range of 750 950 mm year the lowest et rates were observed in the southwestern zones of conus that comprises arizona nevada and utah the lowest et rates ranged from 10 to 100 mm year on the other hand the northeastern states also had significantly lower annual average et rates in the range of 100 250 mm year due to lower net radiation and reduced sunshine hours in the region compared to the south and midwest zones fig 3 the spatial average et over the conus was 337 mm year which is approximately 50 percent of the spatial average precipitation over the period of 2004 2010 i e 776 mm year the annual average et rates pattern over the conus region from this study shows a similar pattern from hobbins et al 2001a hobbins et al 2001b and hobbins et al 2001c study where they mapped mean annual et rates using the crae model over the entire conus region specifically hobbins et al 2001a hobbins et al 2001b and hobbins et al 2001c study mapped the highest values of et rates in the coastline of the gulf of mexico and decreased et rates towards north and west away from the gulf of mexico the lower et rates were reported in the western part particularly in the sierra nevada and rocky mountains these observations from hobbins et al 2001a hobbins et al 2001b and hobbins et al 2001c study were similarly observed in the present study the study period for hobbins et al 2001a hobbins et al 2001b and hobbins et al 2001c to compute mean annual average et rates were different than the current study period however the mean yearly values show similar spatial patterns due to a similar complementary relationship model i e crae model adopted from both hobbins et al 2001a hobbins et al 2001b and hobbins et al 2001c and the present study 3 2 grace twsc grids over the conus twsa signals were converted into twsc grids for the corresponding months to conveniently integrate with other water cycle components such as precipitation and et in the water balance equation the spatial average twsc values over each huc 2 unit were computed for all months over the period of 2004 2010 fig 4 for ease of interpretation and comparison of these twsc signals we separated huc 2 basins based on the west the north south and the eastern zones of conus table 1 as was done in a study by naz et al 2016 furthermore for relative comparison twsc signals we kept a constant range of twsc signals from 100 mm to 100 mm across all three plots fig 4a c in the western zone of conus the highest variations in the range of 90 cm to 90 cm were observed for the pacific northwest while the lowest variations were observed in the range of 10 cm to 10 cm for the rio grande basin the rio grande basin lies in the southern border of conus where sonoran and chihuahuan deserts receive relatively lesser precipitation that causes minor fluctuations in the twsc signals the seasonality of the highest and lowest twsc signals was observed during post monsoon i e november and december and pre monsoon june july seasons overall the twsc signals show a negative trend which implies increased exploitation of water resources compared to storage and recharge in the western zones of the conus the lower mississippi basin in the north south zone of conus shows extreme variations in the twsc signals due to significant storage and flow in the surface water systems in the region for example diurnal variations of water levels in the largest lakes while largest rivers systems such as mississippi river itself carrying a significant amount of water throughout the season causing this huge fluctuation except for the lower mississippi basin the remaining basins in the north south zone of conus show relatively lower twsc variations in the range of 50 mm to 50 mm unlike in the western zone there is no single basin in the north south zone that shows twsc variations within 10 mm which indicates that these regions receive sufficient precipitation thus causing relatively higher variations in the twsc fig 4b however the overall trend in the twsc signals indicates that there is more depletion than the addition of total water storage in the eastern conus the tennessee basin showed the highest variations in twsc signals compared to other basins in the region fig 4c although the change in the total water storage magnitude increased after 2008 there was no clear increasing or decreasing trend noticed in this region which indicates that the addition and removal of the total water from the basins is almost balanced over the study period fig 4d shows the spatial average of twsc signals computed over the west north south and east zones of conus the overall twsc fluctuations were contained within 50 mm in which the west and north south zones show the highest positive twsc signal during the end of 2005 and 2009 respectively fig 4d the mean monthly spatial grace twsc grids are shown in fig 5 we plotted twsc values with a scale range of 200 mm month to 200 mm month across all months for ease of interpretation the maximum positive twsc was observed up to 180 mm month during october january while the twsc over the conus mainly were negative and ranged up to 100 mm month during may august this is because the availability of water storage in the storage structures lakes rivers and reservoirs is generally higher after the monsoon season also soil moisture and groundwater storage increase during and after the precipitation events thus the total water storage which is the sum of snow cover depth surface water in the storage structures soil moisture and groundwater is higher after the monsoon season water usage for different purposes such as irrigation industrial household and other environmental flow requirements and significant evaporation and evapotranspiration losses before the monsoon season cause the negative twsc fig 5 we also noticed that the extreme positive twsc values during october through january and drastic negative changes during may through august were observed in the northwestern and southeastern zones of the conus respectively fig 5 this is primarily because these regions receive significantly higher precipitation rates during the monsoon season and a significant amount of this precipitation is getting stored in the large water bodies and natural depressions present in the regions a decadal i e from 2007 to 2017 average twsa across the conus during march and august was mapped by adusumilli et al adusumilli et al 2019 although we consider the temporal coverage from 2004 to 2010 to compute mean monthly maps in the present study the spatial patterns in the twsc values during march and august across the conus show a similar pattern with adusumilli et al 2019 twsa results the western and southeastern zones of conus during august show extreme negative twsc values in the present study which is also reflected in the adusumilli et al 2019 analysis 3 3 estimated runoff from cr grace method the cr grace model estimated monthly runoff observed runoff from usgs runoff datasets and the percentage deviation error calculated from estimated and observed grid values are shown in fig 6 the observed runoff grids were calculated based on huc 2 basins runoff values using the inverse distance weighting interpolation method the percentage deviation error was calculated as the ratio of the differenced value between modelled and observed runoff grids to the observed runoff grids the cr grace model estimated runoff values were in good agreement with observed runoff values for most of the months except july october during november through june the estimated percentage deviation error was between 5 in most conus regions fig 6a during july through october the percentage error deviation was increased up to 10 in central zones of conus and increased up to 15 in southwestern desert zones of the conus fig 6b this is because the cr grace model overestimates runoff values during monsoon season the cr grace model overestimated runoff values during monsoon season i e july through october as the grace twsc values ranged in extreme negative values the extreme negative twsc values during this monsoon season were balanced by the increased runoff as per eq 6 however the cr grace model overall performance was satisfactory as the estimated percentage deviation error was within 15 across most of the conus area and for all months the mean monthly runoff values were aggregated to annual average runoff values from cr grace model runoff estimates fig 7 a similarly the mean monthly runoff values were aggregated to annual average runoff values from observed runoff values fig 7b the spatial average values based on 18 huc 2 unit boundaries were calculated from modelled annual average runoff and the observed annual average runoff grids the agreement of these 18 values was plotted on a 1 1 agreement line which is shown in fig 7c it was found that the cr grace model severely overestimates some of the huc 2 basins in the north south zone and southeastern zone specifically july through october months were severely overestimated which cause the overestimation of runoff values at these huc 2 basins fig 6b and fig 7c however the calculated rmse and correlation coefficient values for annual average runoff estimates were 14 7 mm month and 0 81 respectively these values indicate that the estimated values were within reasonable accuracy the quick flow runoff and streamflow runoff are resulting from two different processes the baseflow separation methods are used to separate the quick flow runoff from streamflow runoff as this quick flow runoff is part of streamflow runoff these two estimates often show a high correlation among themselves the part algorithm based quick flow estimates from selected watersheds across conus were compared with twelve quick flow equations from literature studies by reitz and sanford 2019 the generated mean monthly quick flow maps aggregated over 2000 2015 period from reitz and sanford 2019 study results are consistent with the present study mean monthly runoff maps although the magnitude of quick flow and runoff estimates were different depending on the specific bfi values the spatial patterns in the quick flow estimates were consistent with the present study runoff estimates 3 4 baseflow estimation from cr grace model baseflow grids were estimated from runoff and bfi grids using eq 10 the bfi map from the us general service administration data gov portal is shown in fig 8 this bfi map shows a wide variation in the bfi values across the conus for example the annual average bfi values ranged from 60 to 80 in the northwestern zone indicating a significant contribution of baseflow to the respective huc 2 basins runoff while the lowest bfi values less than 25 were found in the south and southwestern zones of conus similarly a significant baseflow contribution was observed in the northern zone great lakes region and some areas of the eastern zone huc 2 basins the pattern of bfi values over conus bears a resemblance to the natural groundwater recharge map pattern which was developed based on baseflow separation techniques adopted in wolock 2003a and wolock 2003b the estimated monthly baseflow grids from the cr grace model were aggregated to annual average baseflow grids fig 9 shows the yearly average baseflow observed baseflow and the corresponding anomaly grids the anomaly map was calculated based on the difference between modelled baseflow grids and observed baseflow grids furthermore we compared baseflow grids from noah lsm vic lsm and cr grace model with respect to usgs based baseflow grids which is also shown in fig 9 we found that the cr grace model baseflow grids were closely matched with the observed baseflow map while there was an overestimation of baseflow values from the vic and noah models these two lsm severely overestimated almost the entire south and east regions with an anomaly range of 250 300 mm year fig 9 on the other hand the south and east regions were slightly under predicted by the cr grace model with the anomaly ranges of 50 to 100 mm year we also extracted spatially averaged baseflow values based on the huc 2 units boundary from all three models and compared them with the observed baseflow values fig 10 the comparison results show that the cr grace model results were agreed very well on the 1 1 agreement line while the noah and vic model estimates significantly deviated from the agreement line furthermore the calculated statistical indicators such as rmse values clearly show that the cr grace model was the least erroneous model followed by noah and vic models fig 10 in addition to the rmse index we also calculated mape rbp r and wi indices for all three models as given in table 2 overall the proposed model performs relatively better than the noah model while significantly better than the vic model for example the proposed cr grace model performance for the wi index over noah and vic models was increased by 8 5 and 71 respectively table 2 3 5 ratio factor for et to precipitation and baseflow to precipitation the annual average precipitation annual average et and annual average baseflow maps were used to derive et to precipitation et precipitation and baseflow to precipitation bf precipitation ratio maps fig 11 these et precipitation and bf precipitation maps are useful to understand water use and water diversion patterns across the conus the spatial variations of et precipitation values were close to 1 0 and more than 1 0 in the west and north zones of the conus the extreme et precipitation values were observed over the central part of nevada the lowest et precipitation values on the other hand were observed in the southwest zones of conus where the landforms were identified as deserts fig 11 we also compared these results with a similar study from sanford and selnick 2013 and we found a similar pattern of et precipitation values over these zones but the scenario is entirely different in the eastern zone of conus where precipitation rates are relatively higher than other water cycle components while the et rates were relatively small this is mainly due to the lower availability of net radiation and sunshine hours in these regions verma et al 2016 this brings the et precipitation ratio to less than 0 5 despite higher rates of precipitation received over the northeast zone of conus the annual average bf precipitation values in the eastern and southeastern zones of conus were close to 0 5 while the bf precipitation values in the north south and northwestern zones of conus were less than 0 2 fig 11 according to fig 9 the cr grace estimated annual average baseflow values in the northern southern and northwestern zones of conus were less than 100 mm year the lower contribution of baseflow to streams in the northern southern and northwestern zones of conus is mainly due to lower precipitation rates as a result the estimated bf precipitation values were lower in these regions the estimated baseflow rates on the other hand were comparatively higher in the eastern zone however because of the higher precipitation rates in the eastern zones the bf precipitation fraction was close to or less than 0 5 moreover the calculated bf precipitation values were never reached greater than 0 5 anywhere in the conus region indicating that the percentage contribution of baseflow to precipitation among other water cycle components such as et and runoff is always less than 50 at large spatial and long term temporal scales fig 11 4 conclusions spatially distributed runoff and baseflow values provide useful information for surface and groundwater use remote sensing and water balance methods are relatively less parametric and computationally efficient than physical based modeling methods to model the water cycle components at relatively larger spatial scales the use of twsa datasets is critical for understanding total water storage changes over large spatial extents py crae model estimated et rates over conus vary significantly from season to season for example the estimated mean monthly et rates ranged from 0 to 25 mm month during the winter and spring seasons while the estimated et rates reached up to 250 mm month during june and july the northwest and southern zones of conus showed extreme et rates during the summer months due to higher net radiation and soil moisture availability in the respective zones annual average et rates were in the range of 10 100 mm year in the southwestern zones where a cluster of deserts present in the region whereas the highest annual average et rates were in the range of 750 950 mm year in the northwest zone of conus where the extreme precipitation was recorded temporally the lowest and highest twsc variations were observed in the range of 90 90 mm month and 10 10 mm month for the pacific northwest basin and rio grande basin respectively the mountain ranges desert landforms and associated highest and lowest precipitation rates in pacific northwest and the rio grande basins cause these extreme variations in twsc values the highest positive value in twsc up to 180 mm month were estimated over the northwestern and southeastern zones of conus from october through january as these regions have high mountain ranges and higher precipitation rates in the case of the pacific northwest and largest river systems and the substantial number of water bodies in the case of the southeast the cr grace model estimated annual runoff values were substantially agreed with observed runoff values with a correlation coefficient and rmse values of 0 81 and 14 7 mm month respectively the cr grace model estimated baseflow values were better than the noah lsm and vic lsm model estimates as the calculated rmse values of these three models were 62 16 101 00 207 32 mm year respectively the remote sensing and regional water balance method i e cr grace for estimating runoff and baseflow at the regional scale is more robust than the gldas lsm compared in this study another advantage of the cr grace model over process based models is that this model requires less parametrization and computational power some limitations of this method include uncertainties associated with the input datasets for example the uncertainties related to gridded grace twsa and ncep narr reanalysis datasets would reflect the final runoff and baseflow estimates the current version of the cr grace model estimates runoff and baseflow values monthly and is evaluated over annual average time scales thus the application of this model on inter monthly or daily time scales is limited credit authorship contribution statement s mohanasundaram conceptualization

4284,runoff and baseflow estimates provide critical information on surface and groundwater flow dynamics water resource availability and water usage patterns for effective water resource planning and management developing a physical based model at large spatial scales such as continental global scales require extensive datasets complex parameterization and higher computational capacity recent advances in satellite datasets related to water cycle process modeling on the other hand involve less parameterization and more effective computation over larger spatial and finer temporal scales evapotranspiration et is a critical flux in the water cycle that can be estimated with reasonable accuracy from satellite based information by using complementary relationship cr concepts similarly the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission satellite datasets provide useful estimates of total water storage change over large spatial extents grace datasets have been extensively used in groundwater storage change and groundwater depletion studies however the application of grace data products for estimating runoff and baseflow is limited therefore in this study we used a cr approach to estimate et and a water balance method for estimating runoff and baseflow over the conterminous united states conus we evaluated the cr based water balance model cr grace with united states geological survey usgs runoff datasets based on hydrologic unit code level 2 huc 2 basin boundaries the cr grace model estimated annual runoff values agreed with usgs runoff values with root mean square error rmse and correlation coefficient values of 14 7 mm month and 0 81 respectively we also evaluated the cr grace model with two well known land surface models lsm noah lsm and variable infiltration capacity lsm vic lsm from the global land data assimilation system gldas database the comparison results for baseflow estimates from the cr grace model have improved over noah lsm and vic lsm model estimates with rmse values of 62 16 101 00 and 207 32 mm year respectively furthermore this study demonstrates the feasibility of using the cr grace model to estimate runoff and baseflows with limited parameterization and datasets keywords complementary relationship grace evapotranspiration baseflow runoff water balance equation script availability statement the developed r scripts for estimating long term runoff and baseflow grids are provided in the following github repository https github com mohanasundaram1986 baseflow git 1 introduction river discharge or runoff and baseflow i e a portion of runoff measurements provide useful information for water resources planning basin scale water budgeting and watershed modelling runoff in a basin is influenced by meteorological factors such as intensity of rainfall duration of rainfall amount of rainfall type of precipitation distribution of rainfall over the basin and other meteorological factors affecting evapotranspiration et such as temperature wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity dingman 2002 runoff is also inherently influenced by physical characteristics of the basin such as vegetation land use soil types soil characteristics topography elevation and size and shape of the basin similarly baseflow to the rivers and streams is influenced by underlying geology soil topography rainfall land cover groundwater table recharge and discharge mechanisms zhang and schilling 2006 aksoy and wittenberg 2011 however runoff is generally measured at specific locations in the basins by manual or automatic gauging stations while baseflow is usually estimated from streamflow with baseflow separation methods which is again limited to the specific sites where runoff is being measured the sparse distribution of measurement sites and intermittent observations restrict the application of spatial distribution of runoff and baseflow estimates for the effective management of surface and groundwater resources at a basin scale the water balance equation at region scale or watershed scale can be written as precipitation equals to a sum of et runoff and change in total water storage components nowadays reliable precipitation datasets across the globe are reasonably available with moderate spatial and temporal resolutions the et process involves a complex interaction with the atmosphere soil and crop parameters parametric process based et models typically require intensive datasets such as soil crop and climatic data to derive et at different spatial scales with reasonable accuracy droogers 2000 salama et al 2015 li et al 2016a tegos et al 2017 but remote sensing based methods have the advantage of estimating hydrological fluxes such as et from routinely available weather parameters without actually integrating intensive and complex land use crop and soil parameters anayah and kaluarachchi 2014 ma et al 2015 gao et al 2018 the complementary relationship cr based et estimation methods are widely used for assessing et at catchment regional scales anayah and kaluarachchi 2014 satellite derived input gridded datasets such as temperature relative humidity and radiation are mainly used to derive cr based et fluxes hobbins et al 2001a 2001b 2001c xu and singh 2005 szilagyi and jozsa 2009 mcmahon et al 2013 shanmugam et al 2020 the complementary relationship areal evapotranspiration crae model has been developed explicitly for estimating et for landscape environment morton 1983 morton et al 1985 shanmugam et al 2020 the robust validation of cr based annual average et fluxes against the water balance data shows the significance of remote sensing based et estimation methods for practical applications hobbins et al 2001a 2001b 2001c szilagyi 2015 shanmugam et al 2020 the runoff component can be modelled by a physical based distributed modeling approach at different spatial and time scales jaiswal et al 2020 villa alvarado et al 2014 paniconi and putti 2015 reggiani and schellekens 2006 devia et al 2015 however physical based runoff modeling methods require intensive input datasets and a calibration process against observed runoff datasets the physical based modelling process is demanding on many occasions where the observations are limited or discontinuous due to missing data moreover the process based models have certain limitations to computational capacity over large spatial scales such as regional or continental global scales for these reasons remote sensing based spatial datasets play an inevitable role in spatial monitoring and modelling processes chen et al 2021 luo et al 2021 singh jasrotia et al 2021 wasko et al 2021 gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission dataset is one such a remote sensed data product that can be applied for several hydrological applications including runoff estimation from relatively larger basins the change in the terrestrial gravitational field is converted into estimates of change in the terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa using spherical harmonic coefficients and a series of post processing procedures for hydrological applications landerer and swenson 2012 the twsa datasets represent the equivalent depth of water in canopy rivers lakes snow cover soil moisture and groundwater the twsa is also a deviation from the baseline average values and the average baseline period is typically from 2004 to 2009 in the grace mission datasets although grace datasets are available at coarser spatial scales i e 3 or 300 km the application of grace datasets on medium spatial scales watersheds i e 50 000 km2 also demonstrated that the water balance calculation from grace is in good agreement with hydrological model outputs and in situ runoff observations biancamaria et al 2019 some applications of grace datasets include long term trend analysis of twsa along with local and regional climate and land use drivers yang et al 2017 seyoum 2018 hasan and tarhule 2020 wei et al 2021 xiong et al 2021 global land data assimilation system gldas datasets were developed from compiling ground and satellite based observations using sophisticated land surface models lsm that produce surface and subsurface fluxes such as et runoff and baseflow rodell et al 2004 some studies have used twsa datasets along with gldas lsm simulated fluxes such as et in the regional water balance equations to retrieve runoff at different catchment scales syed et al 2009 li et al 2012 2016b sridhar et al 2019 hu et al 2021 however very limited studies have focused on retrieving gridded runoff using grace and gldas datasets at national continental scales moreover a combination of independent cr based et estimates with the application of twsa datasets in the regional water balance equation to retrieve gridded runoff over national continental scales approach is never attempted to our best knowledge baseflow is often separated indirectly from streamflow records many studies have separated baseflow components from runoff records rutledge 1992 stewart et al 2007 risser et al 2009 the automated web based hydrograph method separates baseflow from runoff time series data zomlot et al 2015 the comparison between different baseflow separation methods such as part rutledge 2007a 2007b rora rutledge 2007b base flow index wahl and wahl 2001 and what lim et al 2004 show that many of them correlate closely with each other in terms of their output performance combalicer et al 2008 eckhardt 2008 the baseflow index bfi describes the ratio of baseflow to the total streamflow or runoff this index is often used to calculate the baseflow which is assumed to be approximately equal to base recharge in the regional water balance equations szilagyi et al 2003 but the base recharge and the total recharge differ slightly in quantity when there is less or no extraction of groundwater by vegetation in contrast the difference in total recharge and base recharge might be significant in quantity when there is a considerable consumption of groundwater by the vegetation which occurs in the riparian zones szilagyi et al 2005 regional scale annual average baseflow estimation using baseflow separation methods has some limitations in that these methods calculate the bfi and baseflow values at runoff measuring sites these point values of baseflow estimates adopt some interpolation methods to create spatial baseflow grids this limitation can be addressed by first integrating remote sensing derived hydrological fluxes such as cr derived et and grace based twsa datasets into the regional water balance equation cr grace to obtain spatially distributed annual average runoff fluxes secondly the regional scale annual average baseflow can be derived from cr grace runoff and bfi gridded maps furthermore the evaluation of remote sensing and grace based baseflow estimates can be compared with gldas lsm derived baseflow grids at similar spatial and temporal scales the present study aims to retrieve monthly gridded runoff and baseflow from cr grace based water balance approach over continental scale this study also evaluates the performance of the cr grace model baseflow estimates against two selected lsm noah lsm and vic lsm baseflow estimates the specific objectives of this study are 1 estimating monthly evapotranspiration from grid based cr model 2 developing monthly runoff grids from cr grace approach 3 estimating baseflow grids from bfi and runoff grids and 4 evaluating the performance of cr grace model baseflow estimates against gldas based noah lsm and vic lsm model baseflow estimates 2 methodology and data 2 1 study area the conterminous united states conus was selected as the study area in the present study fig 1 the latitude and longitude coverage of conus ranges from 24 n to 50 n and 66 15 w to 125 w the elevation in the western zones of conus ranges up to 3800 m while the elevation varies less than 100 m in the southeastern zones of the conus fig 1 the entire conus is divided and subdivided into different hydrological units the first classification level divides the entire conus into 18 major geographic areas also named hydrological unit code 2 level basins huc 2 the huc 2 regions are delineated based on the drainage area of the major river systems in the conus in the western zones of the conus the two major river systems include the colorado river in the southwest and the columbia river in the northwest the largest conus river system is the missouri river system huc 2 unit 10 in fig 1 which feeds into the mississippi river the physical characteristics of conus are extremely diverse ranging from mountainous regions in the west to flat terrain in the east and temperate rainforest to arid deserts the most variable climates in the conus occur in the center of the country near north dakota where the extreme temperatures have ranged between 49 and 51 c during summer and winter months respectively whereas in the west california oregon and washington are influenced by pacific coastal climates and the difference between summer and winter seasons climate is marginal oehser et al 2020 the precipitation patterns also vary across conus the pacific coastal range forms a rain shadow dividing the climate on the western side and the eastern side of the mountains the rain shadows continue eastward towards the rocky mountains creating arid to semi arid climates in the intermontane zones in the extreme east humidity increases as moist and unstable air drifts from the gulf of mexico producing more precipitation than the pacific and open atlantic oceans the annual average precipitation from the last decade over the conus is about 767 mm year while the highest and lowest statewide average precipitation received is 1528 mm year and 248 mm year in louisiana and nevada respectively the annual average et varies from 200 mm year in some western states such as nevada and arizona to 4000 mm year in some southeastern states such as alabama mississippi and louisiana reitz et al 2017 the usgs groundwater and streamflow information programs support monitoring and collecting streamflow and water level at around 8500 sites this data is available online for several needs such as flood warnings water allocation monitoring environmental conditions power production and recreational activities u s geological survey 2020 national streamflow networks nsn and federal priority stream gauges fps consist of all stream gauges that continuously monitor streamflow the nsn alone monitors 8200 gauges and fps monitors around 3600 gauges the principal aquifers in the united states include the floridan aquifer systems in southeastern conus composed of productive limestone and the northern atlantic coastal plain aquifer system composed of semi consolidated sands reilley et al 2008 the usgs also monitors groundwater withdrawals for several sectors including agriculture municipal and industries ninety percent of the groundwater withdrawal for these three sectors comes from 20 principal aquifers in the united states reilley et al 2008 2 2 grace and grace fo datasets grace mission

terrestrial water storage on land and ocean landerer et al 2020 the specific datasets used in this study is the gridded monthly water storage depth anomalies from jet propulsion laboratory jpl grace

sections about 2bdata the jpl rl06 v02 surface mass change grids are available at 0 5 which is approximately equal to 56 km the temporal coverage of this dataset is from april 2002 to june 2020 at a monthly interval watkins et al 2015 wiese et al 2018 however we extracted the monthly grids from january 2004 to december 2010 to avoid missing data between 2002 and 2004 and after 2010 and to ensure continuity in the time series data this data in network common data form netcdf files were processed into independent monthly grids in the r package r core team 2013 2 3 ncep narr climatic and radiation datasets climatic parameters including precipitation dew point temperature and mean air temperature was retrieved from national centers for environmental prediction ncep north american regional reanalysis narr data products ncep narr 2005 over the period of 2004 to 2010 all ncep narr datasets were in wgs 1984 lambert conformal conic projection coordinate systems with a spatial resolution of 0 3 i e 32 km the accumulated total precipitation variable in kg m2 was converted to monthly precipitation in mm monthly dew point temperature and mean air temperature at 2 m height above the surface in k were converted to c radiation datasets including downward shortwave radiation flux dsrf downward longwave radiation flux dlrf upward shortwave radiation flux usrf and upward longwave radiation flux ulrf at a monthly time interval from january 2004 to december 2010 were retrieved from ncep narr as net radiation at the soil plant interface is a critical parameter in the calculation of et from the grid based complementary relationship areal evapotranspiration py crae model shanmugam et al 2020 this flux was calculated based on surface level dsrf dlrf usrf and ulrf fluxes as follows 1 n rad dsrf d l r f usrf u l r f where n rad is the net radiation flux at the surface in w m2 2 4 usgs runoff and baseflow datasets the streamflow runoff or runoff values calculated over huc 2 were retrieved from the usgs waterwatch website http waterwatch usgs gov the huc 2 runoff is calculated based on historical streamflow from stream gauges huc 2 boundaries and stream gauge based drainage basins in this study we used huc 2 level runoff values as they represent relatively larger spatial extents within the conus boundary in total there were 18 units of huc 2 basins the spatial extent of these huc 2 basins ranges from 105 949 km2 to 783 066 km2 fig 1 these huc 2 basins spatial extents can be conveniently compared to grace data products original spatial resolutions of 300 300 km the huc 2 monthly runoff values were retrieved from 2004 to 2010 also we retrieved the gridded bfi map from the department of the interior us general service administration data gov portal https catalog data gov dataset base flow index grid for the conterminous united states to compute baseflow grids the usgs based baseflow grids were calculated by multiplying the annual average bfi map with usgs runoff grids 2 5 gldas baseflow datasets we retrieved baseflow datasets from two lsm noah10 m and vic10 m from the gldas database over the period of 2004 2010 for comparison li et al 2020 beaudoing and rodell 2020 the spatial and temporal resolutions of these two lsm were 1 1 and monthly respectively as these model simulated baseflow datasets were in kg m2 3 hour accumulated units averaged over monthly time scales we converted these baseflow datasets to mm month units by multiplying with a factor of 240 2 6 methodology 2 6 1 spatially distributed evapotranspiration mapping using grid based py crae model actual et et can be estimated based on potential et etp and wet environment et etw using a complementary relationship bouchet 1963 the crae model estimates etp etw and et for the landscape environment morton 1983 the formulation for crae model et is as follows 2 e t 2 e tw e tp where all values are in mm potential et for eq 2 can be estimated by solving the energy balance and vapor transfer equations respectively for potential et and equilibrium temperatures as follows 3 e tp 1 λ r n γ p f t 4 ε σ t 273 3 t e t a 4 e tp 1 λ f t v e v d where r n is the net radiation for the soil plant surface at air temperature f t is the vapor transfer coefficient w m 2 mbar 1 γ is the psychrometric constant mbar c 1 p is the atmospheric pressure at the station mbar ε is the surface emissivity σ is the stephen boltzmann constant 5 67 10 8 w m 2 k 4 t e is equilibrium temperature c t a is air temperature c v e is the saturation vapor pressure at equilibrium temperature t e mbar v d is saturation vapour pressure at dew point temperature t d mbar λ is latent heat of vaporization w d kg 1 the wet environment areal et can be estimated using the priestley taylor equation priestley and taylor 1972 the formulation for etw is as follows 5 e tw b 1 b 2 1 γ p δ p r tp where r tp is the net radiation for the soil plant surface at te w m 2 δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve at t e mbar c 1 b 1 b 2 are empirical coefficients and the corresponding values are 14 w m 2 and 1 2 respectively mcmahon et al 2013 morton et al 1985 developed a computer program called wrevap to calculate point based et using weather station inputs the point estimated et values often adopt some interpolation approach to establish a spatially continuous et map over regional scales moreover the complicated part of the wrevap program is based on deriving the net radiation from weather inputs shanmugam et al 2020 developed a grid based et estimation model i e py crae to estimate et under heterogeneous surface conditions to overcome these issues in interpolating point estimates over spatial grids and the complex calculation of net radiation from weather station inputs the validity of the py crae model was extensively tested with water balance based et values from huc 8 level basins in the state of nebraska usa therefore in this study we adopted the same py crae model to estimate gridded et over the entire conus region the input datasets for the py crae model were gridded mean air temperature dewpoint temperature and net radiation that is computed using eq 1 the py crae model outputs were optimized t e at the soil plant surface r n at the soil plant surface etw etp and et the te for soil plant surface was optimized for each grid in the conus for every monthly time step using the iteration process the t e grids were the input to calculate the final r n for soil plant surface grids finally the monthly et grids were derived from etp and etw grids more detailed information about the py crae model including model scripts and input data requirements can be found in shanmugam et al 2020 2 6 2 terrestrial water storage change from grace datasets grace mascons jpl rl06 v02 netcdf files were converted to individual monthly grids these monthly grids represent the twsa in equivalent water thickness in cm units for the compatibility of units we converted these grids from cm units to mm units as other water cycle components such as precipitation and et were estimated in mm units for the compatibility of projections we converted all grids into the nad83 geographic coordinate system the original grace mean monthly twsa values represent mean values between two consecutive months and not the change between the first and last days of the month but the water cycle components such as precipitation et and runoff are typically estimated or aggregated at a monthly interval therefore the subsequent mean monthly twsa values from grace were converted to respective month change called terrestrial water storage change twsc by adopting a second order central differencing function using eq 6 as follows biancamaria et al 2019 6 twsc m twsa m 1 t w s a m 1 2 where twsc m is the value of twsc at month m twsa m 1 and twsa m 1 are successive and preceding m months values of twsa 2 6 3 gridded runoff estimation from grace and water balance equation the runoff from a catchment is measured at the stream gauge locations the site specific point observed runoff values are often used to calibrate and validate the hydrological and hydrodynamic models the hydrological and hydrodynamic model calibration requires intensive datasets on soil land cover topography slope characteristics and climatic variables that drive the whole system sometimes most of these input data for hydrological and hydrodynamic model calibrations come from satellite and reanalysis data products stisen et al 2008 liu et al 2012 however developing hydrological and hydrodynamic models integrating several processes at larger spatial scales is computationally intensive and subject to uncertainty in the estimates therefore in this study we modelled hydrological components independently and integrated them with a water balance equation the regional scale water balance equation can be written using eq 7 as follows 7 p e t r o t w s c where p is precipitation mm et is evapotranspiration mm ro is runoff mm twsc is total water storage change mm in eq 7 the precipitation and twsc were directly derived from ncep narr reanalysis and grace datasets respectively the et grids were estimated by the py crae model therefore the remaining unknown runoff component in eq 7 can be calculated using eq 8 as follows 8 ro p e t t w s c we resampled ncep narr precipitation and py crae et grids with respect to the twsa grid resolution to ensure compatibility in spatial scales across all datasets 2 6 4 baseflow estimation from gridded runoff and baseflow index baseflow is the contribution of groundwater flow to the streams and it can be separated from the streamflow hydrographs using filtering methods and computer programs eckhardt 2008 barlow et al 2015 sometimes the long term baseflow is approximately equated to base recharge lee et al 2006 szilagyi et al 2003 the long term base recharge or baseflow can be estimated using precipitation remote sensing derived et and bfi values using eq 9 as follows 9 bfi p e t b f i r o q b r b where q b is the baseflow mm year r b is the base recharge mm year eq 9 assumes that the twsc values with long term average temporal scales can be ignored due to their insignificant value however in the present study we accounted twsc component in the water balance equation while computing the baseflow component from total runoff and bfi grids therefore the formulation for baseflow estimation from runoff and bfi grids is provided in eq 10 as follows 10 bfi p e t t w s c b f i r o q b r b 2 6 5 comparison of model based gridded runoff and baseflow with usgs observation datasets the runoff grids were estimated from monthly precipitation et and twsc grids using eq 8 the mean monthly runoff grids were computed by aggregating and averaging the respective monthly runoff grids over the entire conus region from time series runoff grids furthermore the annual average runoff grids were calculated by summing all mean monthly runoff grids similarly the annual average baseflow grids were generated by multiplying the yearly average runoff grids with the yearly average bfi grid the yearly average runoff and baseflow grid values were averaged over huc 2 level basins to compare with the usgs runoff and baseflow datasets also the proposed cr grace model performance was evaluated against noah lsm and vic lsm baseflow estimates for the comparison purpose five model performance assessment indices root mean square error rmse relative bias percent rbp mean absolute percent error mape wilmott index of agreement wi and correlation coefficient r were computed using eqs 11 through 15 as follows 11 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 12 rbp i 1 n s i o i i 1 n o i 100 13 mape 1 n i 1 n o i s

o is mean value of the observations s is the mean value of the estimations n is the total number of observations 3 results and discussion 3 1 estimating et using the py crae model the estimated mean monthly et by the py crae model is shown in fig 2 the mean monthly et values were calculated from respective monthly images over the period of 2004 2010 it was observed that the estimated mean monthly et values were less than 25 mm month during the winter and spring seasons i e september to december and january to march while the extreme et values were estimated up to 250 mm month during june and july the critical factors influencing the variability in the et estimates include variations in the net radiation and soil moisture status the net radiation during the summer season is more acute than other months while the soil moisture status during these seasons from precipitation and irrigation practices is relatively higher than in any other months therefore the estimated et rates during the summer months were higher when compared to other months fig 2 the spatial distribution of et rates was higher over the mid western and the southern states of conus and especially the extreme et rates were estimated over the great lakes and its surrounding areas a substantial difference in the distribution of et rates during the summer months was observed among some of the western states of conus for example the western coastal states such as washington oregon and central and north of california were showing relatively higher et rates up to 150 mm month while the other western states specifically arizona utah nevada and southern california were showing et rates less than 50 mm month the lower et rates in the southwestern regions were mainly due to dry soil and less moisture availability as these regions belong to two major deserts of the mojave and sonoran deserts annual average et rates in the conus region are shown in fig 3 the extreme et rates with a range of 750 950 mm year were observed in coastal oregon washington and california similarly the southern coastal borders of texas and louisiana also showed extreme et rates with a range of 750 950 mm year the lowest et rates were observed in the southwestern zones of conus that comprises arizona nevada and utah the lowest et rates ranged from 10 to 100 mm year on the other hand the northeastern states also had significantly lower annual average et rates in the range of 100 250 mm year due to lower net radiation and reduced sunshine hours in the region compared to the south and midwest zones fig 3 the spatial average et over the conus was 337 mm year which is approximately 50 percent of the spatial average precipitation over the period of 2004 2010 i e 776 mm year the annual average et rates pattern over the conus region from this study shows a similar pattern from hobbins et al 2001a hobbins et al 2001b and hobbins et al 2001c study where they mapped mean annual et rates using the crae model over the entire conus region specifically hobbins et al 2001a hobbins et al 2001b and hobbins et al 2001c study mapped the highest values of et rates in the coastline of the gulf of mexico and decreased et rates towards north and west away from the gulf of mexico the lower et rates were reported in the western part particularly in the sierra nevada and rocky mountains these observations from hobbins et al 2001a hobbins et al 2001b and hobbins et al 2001c study were similarly observed in the present study the study period for hobbins et al 2001a hobbins et al 2001b and hobbins et al 2001c to compute mean annual average et rates were different than the current study period however the mean yearly values show similar spatial patterns due to a similar complementary relationship model i e crae model adopted from both hobbins et al 2001a hobbins et al 2001b and hobbins et al 2001c and the present study 3 2 grace twsc grids over the conus twsa signals were converted into twsc grids for the corresponding months to conveniently integrate with other water cycle components such as precipitation and et in the water balance equation the spatial average twsc values over each huc 2 unit were computed for all months over the period of 2004 2010 fig 4 for ease of interpretation and comparison of these twsc signals we separated huc 2 basins based on the west the north south and the eastern zones of conus table 1 as was done in a study by naz et al 2016 furthermore for relative comparison twsc signals we kept a constant range of twsc signals from 100 mm to 100 mm across all three plots fig 4a c in the western zone of conus the highest variations in the range of 90 cm to 90 cm were observed for the pacific northwest while the lowest variations were observed in the range of 10 cm to 10 cm for the rio grande basin the rio grande basin lies in the southern border of conus where sonoran and chihuahuan deserts receive relatively lesser precipitation that causes minor fluctuations in the twsc signals the seasonality of the highest and lowest twsc signals was observed during post monsoon i e november and december and pre monsoon june july seasons overall the twsc signals show a negative trend which implies increased exploitation of water resources compared to storage and recharge in the western zones of the conus the lower mississippi basin in the north south zone of conus shows extreme variations in the twsc signals due to significant storage and flow in the surface water systems in the region for example diurnal variations of water levels in the largest lakes while largest rivers systems such as mississippi river itself carrying a significant amount of water throughout the season causing this huge fluctuation except for the lower mississippi basin the remaining basins in the north south zone of conus show relatively lower twsc variations in the range of 50 mm to 50 mm unlike in the western zone there is no single basin in the north south zone that shows twsc variations within 10 mm which indicates that these regions receive sufficient precipitation thus causing relatively higher variations in the twsc fig 4b however the overall trend in the twsc signals indicates that there is more depletion than the addition of total water storage in the eastern conus the tennessee basin showed the highest variations in twsc signals compared to other basins in the region fig 4c although the change in the total water storage magnitude increased after 2008 there was no clear increasing or decreasing trend noticed in this region which indicates that the addition and removal of the total water from the basins is almost balanced over the study period fig 4d shows the spatial average of twsc signals computed over the west north south and east zones of conus the overall twsc fluctuations were contained within 50 mm in which the west and north south zones show the highest positive twsc signal during the end of 2005 and 2009 respectively fig 4d the mean monthly spatial grace twsc grids are shown in fig 5 we plotted twsc values with a scale range of 200 mm month to 200 mm month across all months for ease of interpretation the maximum positive twsc was observed up to 180 mm month during october january while the twsc over the conus mainly were negative and ranged up to 100 mm month during may august this is because the availability of water storage in the storage structures lakes rivers and reservoirs is generally higher after the monsoon season also soil moisture and groundwater storage increase during and after the precipitation events thus the total water storage which is the sum of snow cover depth surface water in the storage structures soil moisture and groundwater is higher after the monsoon season water usage for different purposes such as irrigation industrial household and other environmental flow requirements and significant evaporation and evapotranspiration losses before the monsoon season cause the negative twsc fig 5 we also noticed that the extreme positive twsc values during october through january and drastic negative changes during may through august were observed in the northwestern and southeastern zones of the conus respectively fig 5 this is primarily because these regions receive significantly higher precipitation rates during the monsoon season and a significant amount of this precipitation is getting stored in the large water bodies and natural depressions present in the regions a decadal i e from 2007 to 2017 average twsa across the conus during march and august was mapped by adusumilli et al adusumilli et al 2019 although we consider the temporal coverage from 2004 to 2010 to compute mean monthly maps in the present study the spatial patterns in the twsc values during march and august across the conus show a similar pattern with adusumilli et al 2019 twsa results the western and southeastern zones of conus during august show extreme negative twsc values in the present study which is also reflected in the adusumilli et al 2019 analysis 3 3 estimated runoff from cr grace method the cr grace model estimated monthly runoff observed runoff from usgs runoff datasets and the percentage deviation error calculated from estimated and observed grid values are shown in fig 6 the observed runoff grids were calculated based on huc 2 basins runoff values using the inverse distance weighting interpolation method the percentage deviation error was calculated as the ratio of the differenced value between modelled and observed runoff grids to the observed runoff grids the cr grace model estimated runoff values were in good agreement with observed runoff values for most of the months except july october during november through june the estimated percentage deviation error was between 5 in most conus regions fig 6a during july through october the percentage error deviation was increased up to 10 in central zones of conus and increased up to 15 in southwestern desert zones of the conus fig 6b this is because the cr grace model overestimates runoff values during monsoon season the cr grace model overestimated runoff values during monsoon season i e july through october as the grace twsc values ranged in extreme negative values the extreme negative twsc values during this monsoon season were balanced by the increased runoff as per eq 6 however the cr grace model overall performance was satisfactory as the estimated percentage deviation error was within 15 across most of the conus area and for all months the mean monthly runoff values were aggregated to annual average runoff values from cr grace model runoff estimates fig 7 a similarly the mean monthly runoff values were aggregated to annual average runoff values from observed runoff values fig 7b the spatial average values based on 18 huc 2 unit boundaries were calculated from modelled annual average runoff and the observed annual average runoff grids the agreement of these 18 values was plotted on a 1 1 agreement line which is shown in fig 7c it was found that the cr grace model severely overestimates some of the huc 2 basins in the north south zone and southeastern zone specifically july through october months were severely overestimated which cause the overestimation of runoff values at these huc 2 basins fig 6b and fig 7c however the calculated rmse and correlation coefficient values for annual average runoff estimates were 14 7 mm month and 0 81 respectively these values indicate that the estimated values were within reasonable accuracy the quick flow runoff and streamflow runoff are resulting from two different processes the baseflow separation methods are used to separate the quick flow runoff from streamflow runoff as this quick flow runoff is part of streamflow runoff these two estimates often show a high correlation among themselves the part algorithm based quick flow estimates from selected watersheds across conus were compared with twelve quick flow equations from literature studies by reitz and sanford 2019 the generated mean monthly quick flow maps aggregated over 2000 2015 period from reitz and sanford 2019 study results are consistent with the present study mean monthly runoff maps although the magnitude of quick flow and runoff estimates were different depending on the specific bfi values the spatial patterns in the quick flow estimates were consistent with the present study runoff estimates 3 4 baseflow estimation from cr grace model baseflow grids were estimated from runoff and bfi grids using eq 10 the bfi map from the us general service administration data gov portal is shown in fig 8 this bfi map shows a wide variation in the bfi values across the conus for example the annual average bfi values ranged from 60 to 80 in the northwestern zone indicating a significant contribution of baseflow to the respective huc 2 basins runoff while the lowest bfi values less than 25 were found in the south and southwestern zones of conus similarly a significant baseflow contribution was observed in the northern zone great lakes region and some areas of the eastern zone huc 2 basins the pattern of bfi values over conus bears a resemblance to the natural groundwater recharge map pattern which was developed based on baseflow separation techniques adopted in wolock 2003a and wolock 2003b the estimated monthly baseflow grids from the cr grace model were aggregated to annual average baseflow grids fig 9 shows the yearly average baseflow observed baseflow and the corresponding anomaly grids the anomaly map was calculated based on the difference between modelled baseflow grids and observed baseflow grids furthermore we compared baseflow grids from noah lsm vic lsm and cr grace model with respect to usgs based baseflow grids which is also shown in fig 9 we found that the cr grace model baseflow grids were closely matched with the observed baseflow map while there was an overestimation of baseflow values from the vic and noah models these two lsm severely overestimated almost the entire south and east regions with an anomaly range of 250 300 mm year fig 9 on the other hand the south and east regions were slightly under predicted by the cr grace model with the anomaly ranges of 50 to 100 mm year we also extracted spatially averaged baseflow values based on the huc 2 units boundary from all three models and compared them with the observed baseflow values fig 10 the comparison results show that the cr grace model results were agreed very well on the 1 1 agreement line while the noah and vic model estimates significantly deviated from the agreement line furthermore the calculated statistical indicators such as rmse values clearly show that the cr grace model was the least erroneous model followed by noah and vic models fig 10 in addition to the rmse index we also calculated mape rbp r and wi indices for all three models as given in table 2 overall the proposed model performs relatively better than the noah model while significantly better than the vic model for example the proposed cr grace model performance for the wi index over noah and vic models was increased by 8 5 and 71 respectively table 2 3 5 ratio factor for et to precipitation and baseflow to precipitation the annual average precipitation annual average et and annual average baseflow maps were used to derive et to precipitation et precipitation and baseflow to precipitation bf precipitation ratio maps fig 11 these et precipitation and bf precipitation maps are useful to understand water use and water diversion patterns across the conus the spatial variations of et precipitation values were close to 1 0 and more than 1 0 in the west and north zones of the conus the extreme et precipitation values were observed over the central part of nevada the lowest et precipitation values on the other hand were observed in the southwest zones of conus where the landforms were identified as deserts fig 11 we also compared these results with a similar study from sanford and selnick 2013 and we found a similar pattern of et precipitation values over these zones but the scenario is entirely different in the eastern zone of conus where precipitation rates are relatively higher than other water cycle components while the et rates were relatively small this is mainly due to the lower availability of net radiation and sunshine hours in these regions verma et al 2016 this brings the et precipitation ratio to less than 0 5 despite higher rates of precipitation received over the northeast zone of conus the annual average bf precipitation values in the eastern and southeastern zones of conus were close to 0 5 while the bf precipitation values in the north south and northwestern zones of conus were less than 0 2 fig 11 according to fig 9 the cr grace estimated annual average baseflow values in the northern southern and northwestern zones of conus were less than 100 mm year the lower contribution of baseflow to streams in the northern southern and northwestern zones of conus is mainly due to lower precipitation rates as a result the estimated bf precipitation values were lower in these regions the estimated baseflow rates on the other hand were comparatively higher in the eastern zone however because of the higher precipitation rates in the eastern zones the bf precipitation fraction was close to or less than 0 5 moreover the calculated bf precipitation values were never reached greater than 0 5 anywhere in the conus region indicating that the percentage contribution of baseflow to precipitation among other water cycle components such as et and runoff is always less than 50 at large spatial and long term temporal scales fig 11 4 conclusions spatially distributed runoff and baseflow values provide useful information for surface and groundwater use remote sensing and water balance methods are relatively less parametric and computationally efficient than physical based modeling methods to model the water cycle components at relatively larger spatial scales the use of twsa datasets is critical for understanding total water storage changes over large spatial extents py crae model estimated et rates over conus vary significantly from season to season for example the estimated mean monthly et rates ranged from 0 to 25 mm month during the winter and spring seasons while the estimated et rates reached up to 250 mm month during june and july the northwest and southern zones of conus showed extreme et rates during the summer months due to higher net radiation and soil moisture availability in the respective zones annual average et rates were in the range of 10 100 mm year in the southwestern zones where a cluster of deserts present in the region whereas the highest annual average et rates were in the range of 750 950 mm year in the northwest zone of conus where the extreme precipitation was recorded temporally the lowest and highest twsc variations were observed in the range of 90 90 mm month and 10 10 mm month for the pacific northwest basin and rio grande basin respectively the mountain ranges desert landforms and associated highest and lowest precipitation rates in pacific northwest and the rio grande basins cause these extreme variations in twsc values the highest positive value in twsc up to 180 mm month were estimated over the northwestern and southeastern zones of conus from october through january as these regions have high mountain ranges and higher precipitation rates in the case of the pacific northwest and largest river systems and the substantial number of water bodies in the case of the southeast the cr grace model estimated annual runoff values were substantially agreed with observed runoff values with a correlation coefficient and rmse values of 0 81 and 14 7 mm month respectively the cr grace model estimated baseflow values were better than the noah lsm and vic lsm model estimates as the calculated rmse values of these three models were 62 16 101 00 207 32 mm year respectively the remote sensing and regional water balance method i e cr grace for estimating runoff and baseflow at the regional scale is more robust than the gldas lsm compared in this study another advantage of the cr grace model over process based models is that this model requires less parametrization and computational power some limitations of this method include uncertainties associated with the input datasets for example the uncertainties related to gridded grace twsa and ncep narr reanalysis datasets would reflect the final runoff and baseflow estimates the current version of the cr grace model estimates runoff and baseflow values monthly and is evaluated over annual average time scales thus the application of this model on inter monthly or daily time scales is limited credit authorship contribution statement s mohanasundaram conceptualization
