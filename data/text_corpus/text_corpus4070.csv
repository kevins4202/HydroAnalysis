20350,the numerical prediction of the hydrodynamic characteristics for planing hulls has always been challenging due to numerical ventilation nv which is the unphysical entrainment of air under a hull the capture of the wetted surface the pressure distribution the spray and wave making phenomena may suffer from this in this paper series the characteristics of the nv were analyzed and anti ventilation techniques based on the volume of fluid vof method were developed and applied the nv was formed by the unphysically transported air phase in the wetted surface to counteract the unphysical transport pseudo diffusive fluxes in specific directions were introduced by adding an artificial diffusion term to the vof equation for the pressure area pa the unphysical results caused by other numerical issues could also be dissipated by this term the boundness of the underlying discretization scheme for the modified vof equation was proved by stability analysis based on the anti ventilation techniques a novel systematic procedure for the hydrodynamic assessment of planing hulls was developed to improve the accuracy stability and convergence rate part 1 of this paper series

area created by the whisker spray 1 introduction planing hulls one type of high speed marine vehicle hsmv have wide military and civilian uses under the action of hydrodynamic lift the running attitude of a planing hull varies demonstrably with the speed a planing hull will be carried out of the water in a high speed planing mode and the impingement and spray of the high speed free stream will produce complicated and unsteady flow phenomena the prediction of the hydrodynamic performances of planing hulls is one of the most challenging areas of ship hydrodynamics early research on high speed planing hulls was mainly conducted with model tests which could provide macroscopic quantities with high accuracy but this type of research is costly and the detailed flow characteristics are hard to capture the regression empirical and semi empirical formulae based on test results are more economical for prediction but these methods lack wide applicability the accuracy of the results depends heavily on the similarity between the object of computation and the ship models the formulae are based on with the advancement of computing resources numerical methods have been widely used to predict the hydrodynamic performance of planing hulls the potential flow and reynolds averaged navier stokes rans methods are two dominant numerical methods for the potential flow methods the governing equations are solved only on the boundary according to the properties of green s second identity thus the boundary elements method bem can be used to solve the equations resulting in fewer meshes the two dimensional plus time dependent theory 2d t munk 1924 based on bem is a widely used method of potential flow theory tulin 1957 applied the theory to slender planing surfaces ogilvie 1967 and chapman 1976 considered the effects of gravity and nonlinear free surfaces conditions respectively in 2d t methods after this some numerical research on hydrodynamic characteristics of planing hulls using 2d t methods was published zhao and faltinsen 1993 vorus 1996 zhao et al 1997 sun and faltinsen 2011 tavakoli and dashtimanesh 2018 bilandi et al 2020 although potential flow methods can improve the computation efficiency as a result of fewer meshes and unknowns the assumptions used to simplify the governing equations limit applicability numerical errors are inevitable where nonlinear and viscous effects are evident chen and lee 1999 took the viscous effect into account presenting an interactive rans laplace coupling method to predict the flow field around a series 60 ship hull the nonlinear free surface of the far field was resolved by laplace equations the kinematic and dynamic conditions were satisfied and only the water phase was solved with rans in the near wall region the free surface fluctuations were hard to capture for this hybrid method for the present computational techniques the rans method with the finite volume method fvm or finite difference method fdm discretization has become the most extensively used approach a crucial issue is the treatment of a free surface which can be divided into interface tracking methods and interface capturing methods most of the former methods are not applicable for unstructured meshes and they are limited to flows with a relatively smooth interface the free surfaces of unsteady viscous flow around a planing hull have always been resolved with the interface capturing method hino et al 1991 developed a finite difference method for inviscid flow with a free surface to simulate the two phase flow around a planing hull and the nonlinear free surface was captured with the maker and cell mac method harlow and welch 1965 in which the location of the free surface was determined by the distribution of the marker particles the mac method can treat complex and unsteady flow phenomena but it is computationally expensive due to the large number of maker particles and the special treatment for the distribution of the makers burg 2005 employed the level set ls method incorporated within an incompressible rans solver to study the flow field around series 60 hull forms the flow was simulated with a fixed mesh where the level set function evolved carrica et al 2007 analyzed the hydrodynamic characteristics of a surface ship free to pitch and heave using the ls method and the rigid overset mesh moving with the ship motion was adopted the ls method is more economic than the mac method but it is not mass conservative another efficient method is the vof methodology hirt and nichols 1981 a simple and mass conservative interface capturing method that can be applied to the capture of a complex free surface the governing equation of the method is a transport equation for the volume fraction of one eulerian phase the discretization scheme for the convective term of the equation is critical for the free surface capture which can be categorized into geometry reconstruction and algebraic schemes the algebraic schemes offer a better compromise between accuracy and computational cost and they are more applicable for engineering calculation the compressive interface capturing scheme for arbitrary meshes cicsam ubbink 1997 and the high resolution interface capturing hric scheme muzaferija and peri 1998 are two frequently used algebraic schemes for studying the flow field around a high speed planing hull table 1 lists some numerical research on planing hulls after the year 2000 as well as the selected discretization schemes for the vof equation the cicsam scheme is highly non diffusive but unphysical results may be generated at the interface the hric scheme based on the normalized variable diagram leonard 1997 has become the predominant approach used to predict the hydrodynamic performance of planing hulls and it is employed by most of the common commercial cfd software programs as the recommended algebraic scheme because of its satisfactory efficiency and accuracy details are provided in section 3 3 nevertheless the prediction using the rans and vof methods still suffers from numerical ventilation nv which is the unphysical entrainment of air under the hull the influences of the nv on the hydrodynamic assessment of planing hulls were discussed in section 2 1 to suppress the nv and improve the prediction accuracy some remedies for the problem have been presented böhm and graf 2014 removed the courant friedrich lewy cfl dependency of the hric scheme to achieve high resolution without any compromise of robustness the method was applicable for seeking a steady state solution when the flow unsteadiness was not evident lee and rhee 2015 applied a novel interface compression method to counteract numerical ventilation by adding an artificial compression term into the vof equation the interface compression method was effective for avoiding numerical diffusion but numerical diffusion was not the root cause of the nv similarly some interface sharpening methods so et al 2011 malgarinos et al 2015 nguyen and park 2017 nguyen et al 2018 for avoiding numerical diffusion cannot completely eliminate the nv viola et al 2012 and wheeler et al 2018 introduced a source term to extract the air phase under the hull avci and barlas 2018 eliminated the unphysical phase under the hull using an artificial phase replacement method although the nv can be reduced the methods were not mass conservative de luca et al 2016 and the nv was not eradicated which may reappear with the advancement of the time step nimmagadda et al 2020 aimed to suppress the unphysical phenomena through special care taken in setting the cfl limits mesh refinement and the coefficients of the hric scheme the prediction accuracy was improved but the method might be too computationally expensive and not widely applicable in summary the rans methods with the vof multiphase treatment method have become the dominant approach for predicting the hydrodynamic characteristics of planing hulls but the accuracies of the predictions have been severely affected by the nv existing numerical methods for eliminating the nv lack extensive applicability and they have difficulty eradicating the sources of the nv and maintaining stability simultaneously thus it is necessary to figure out the formation of the nv and to develop anti ventilation techniques that are capable of eliminating the nv reliably and efficiently achieving higher prediction accuracy in part 1 of this paper series the formation process of the nv was analyzed in terms of the transport of volume fraction based on the finite volume method fvm based on the analyses anti ventilation techniques were developed to eliminate the nv and theoretical test cases were used to demonstrate the elimination effects of the techniques the vof equation was discretized by the hric scheme the boundness of the underlying discretization scheme for the modified vof equation by the anti ventilation techniques was proven with stability analysis based on the anti ventilation techniques a systematic procedure for the hydrodynamic assessment of a planing hull was developed with the aims of achieving high prediction accuracy enhancing the stability and speeding up the convergence the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the formation of the nv is analyzed in section 2 section 3 provides the details of the numerical methods employed in this research the anti ventilation techniques developed in this paper are given in section 4 the conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 formation of numerical ventilation the influences and formation process of the nv was examined the effect of the numerical diffusion on the formation of the nv was analyzed 2 1 overview fig 1 presents the flow details on the bottom of the planing hull the wetted surface could be divided into two regions the pressure area pa and the spray area sa the stagnation line was the boundary between the two areas the high speed freestreams were lashed at a hull surface and some of them were reflected to the chines of the hull the whisker spray was formed by the reflection therefore the stagnation line was always referred to as the spray root line the pressure center was located at the vicinity of the line since the velocity of the freestream relative to the hull at the stagnation line was zero and the pressure attained its maximum value the sa was caused by the whisker spray which increased the wetted surface of the high speed planing hull the pa was aft of the pressure center providing most of the hydrodynamic lift which determined the running attitude of the planing hull the phenomenon of the nv may occur in both the sa and the pa seriously affecting the hydrodynamic characteristics prediction of planing hulls fig 2 böhm and graf 2014 shows the volume fraction of water of a hull surface as shown in the figure the volume fraction of water values generally ranged from zero to unity instead of being zero or unity the volume fraction was evidently under predicted due to the nv the capture of the region located in front of the wetted surface is the most prone to the nv as a result of the proximity of the region to the interface and the complex flow there fig 3 matveev and morabito 2020 shows the volume fraction of the bottom of a planing hull with a negative deadrise angle as shown in the figure the water phase extending forward to the gas phase of the impingement area black circle in was smudged which manifested the effect of the nv due to the weighted average method of the vof method in the determination of fluid properties the kinematic viscosity coefficient and the density will be erroneously calculated when the nv exists causing an under prediction of the viscous resistance furthermore the accuracy of the pressure resistance prediction can also be impaired fig 4 lotfi et al 2015 de marco et al 2017 nimmagadda et al 2020 shows the spray phenomena of running planing hulls the volume fraction of water of the spray phenomena was evidently less than unity an under estimation of the spray pressure resistance might have been caused the effect of the nv on the wave making resistance was discussed by böhm and graf 2014 and they found that the wave damping could be increased by the nv leading to a prediction of lower wave making resistance the pressure resistance was highly related to the hydrodynamic lift since the two types of forces were components of the pressure under the hull thus under predicted pressure resistance indicates a lower hydrodynamic lift additionally erroneously calculated fluid properties can also further reduce the computed lift as a result the running attitude which has a significant influence on the hydrodynamic performances of planing hulls will be erroneously predicted in summary the prediction of the hydrodynamic characteristics of planing hulls is affected severely by the nv the relative errors of the predicted hydrodynamic characteristics in the literatures are presented in part 2 of this paper series this part is mainly focused on the formation of the nv and the methods for eliminating it fig 5 shows the phase distribution and streamlines around a planing hull when this type of multiphase flow around a hsmv planing on a water surface with a trim angle is resolved through a conventional vof method the nv is almost inevitable since the air between the hull bottom and the free surface always tends to be transported into the wetted surface through the corner black circle in fig 5 and any underlying vof discretization scheme is prone to the unphysical transport the formation of the nv could be divided into two parts unphysical air entry to the wetted surface and transport of the unphysical phase in the wetted surface including the sa and pa which will be discussed subsequently furthermore the nv was always aggravated by numerical diffusion that implicit and upwind bias schemes tend to produce hence the influence of the numerical diffusion was also analyzed 2 2 unphysical air entry the air under the hull gained entry to the wetted surface through the pressure center located in the black circle in fig 5 side view where the free stream impinged on the hull fig 6 shows the water distribution near the pressure center i e the zoomed in view of the black circle in fig 5 considering the first layer near wall cell which was forward of the pressure center the faces edges in the side view of which are bold in fig 6 the near wall cells always lie within the log layer of the boundary layer to save the number of cells for high reynolds number flow thus the velocity of the cell was not zero leading to the phase transport through the faces of the cell the transport of the eulerian phases in the near wall cell is also shown in fig 6 the fluxes normal to the longitudinal section were omitted for convenience since their magnitudes were very small the faces on the left and bottom were the upwind sides where the air and water phases were transported into the cells although the transport of the air was unphysical the process could not be identified by the vof method since the two phases shared the same velocity and the immiscibility was unable to be accounted for an accurate capture for the phases of the pressure center demanded that the transport of water from the bottom face be overwhelmingly dominant which could preserve the water phase of the pressure center the mesh and the time step had an influence on the process for the design of the mesh the small aspect ratio was advantageous for the preservation of the water since the transport of water through the bottom face could be more dominant the decrease of the aspect ratio could be achieved by increasing the cell length along the longitudinal direction and or reducing the height of the first layer grid the former would have led to the insufficient resolution of the flow details along the hull especially for the pressure center with pronounced pressure gradient and the latter would have caused an undesirable rise in the near wall cells decreasing the size of the time step was also advantageous for the preservation but the required computation resources would increase accordingly when no special means were adopted to suppress the unphysical transport the air entered the wetted surface due to the high velocity of the air causing the nv in most cases the unphysical phase was always concentrated on the first cells of the boundary layer shown in fig 6 because of the upward transported water 2 3 unphysical air transport after the unphysical air entry for the wetted surface the phase transport was in two halves see fig 1 the downwind transport in the pa shown in fig 6 and the transport into the sa with the action of reflection the air phase transported in the pa was retained until the phase reached the stern since the velocity of this area was essentially tangent to the hull surface and no water phase was transported upward see fig 5 consequently the unphysical phases that came from the pressure center or caused by any numerical issue were transported downwind and the process took a relatively long time as a result of the low velocity of the near wall cells the unphysical results might have appeared constantly and irregularly hence the final converged results could be affected for the transport in the sa located above the free surface the process was relatively complicated fig 7 shows the bottom view of the eulerian phases transport in a cell forward of the sa see the red rectangle in fig 1 the phase transported upward was not expressed since the velocity of the pa was almost tangent to the hull and there was hardly any phase transported in the direction normal to the hull the phase transported into the cell was from the pressure center and the freestream of air the unphysical air included in the phase from the pressure center and the air of the freestream made the accurate capture of the water phase of the sa hard to achieve moreover the unphysical air included in the wetted surface was transported into the main spray causing a reduced volume fraction of water of the spray phenomenon shown in fig 4 reducing the air entry in the pressure center benefited the capture of the pa sa and spray because the proportion of water in the liquid transported into the wetted surface could be increased since the reduction was hard to achieve with the design of the mesh and the time step an effective numerical method was necessary in practice the nv is always aggravated by numerical diffusion which produced the unphysical mixing between the air and the water fig 8 shows the phase distribution being affected by the numerical diffusion on the longitudinal section in the center plane one can see that the interface between different phases was evidently smeared and the unphysical air was not only limited in the first layer of the near wall cells numerical diffusion is quite common when upwind differencing schemes or implicit schemes are used to discretize the vof equation therefore suppressing numerical diffusion is an essential prerequisite for a differencing scheme to eliminate the nv 3 numerical models the vof method the governing equations for ship motions and the widely used hric scheme based on rans equations are presented in this section 3 1 the vof method the vof method hirt and nichols 1981 was used to predict the distribution and movement of the free surface this method is more flexible and efficient than the other free surface treatment methods since no boundary conditions are prescribed at the interface and no grid nodes movement or marker particles are needed for the determination of the free surface position different phases share the same pressure and velocity and the set of mass and momentum conservation equations for the phases are the same ignoring the source term the transport equations of the volume fraction α i of phase i in a control volume v is as follows 1 t α v i d v transient term α s i v d s convection term 0 where v is the velocity vector and s is the surface of the control volume the density ρ and the dynamic viscosity μ are calculated according to a weighted average and they are given by 2 ρ i ρ i α i μ i ρ i μ i where ρ i and μ i are the density and the dynamic viscosity of phase i in this paper series the fully implicit euler method was selected as the temporal discretization scheme for eq 1 because of its robustness furthermore implicit schemes producing more numerical diffusion than explicit schemes can better embody the ability of the anti ventilation techniques to maintain the sharpness of the interface 3 2 governing equations for ship motions the ship motions were modeled by two degrees of freedom equations including the trim and sinkage the sinkage was calculated with an equation for the translation of the center of mass 3 m d v d t c t f p f a f f τ f a f m g where m is the mass of the ship p f and τ f are the pressure and the shear stress on face f respectively and a f and a f are the area vector and the area of face f respectively c t is a time ramping function ranging from zero to unity the value of zero allowed the flow field to initialize before the ship moved and the values increased from zero to unity to enable the resultant force and moment acting on the ship to increase proportionally facilitating a more robust solution with less oscillations the trim was determined using an equation of rotation of the ship 4 m d ω d t ω m ω f r f p f a f f r f τ f a f f r f m f g where m is the tensor of the moments of inertia ω is the angular velocity and r f is the distance vector from the body center of mass to the center of face f the forces and the moments acting on the body were updated at the end of each inner iteration and time step the translation step size d and the rotation step size a were calculated at the end of a time step 5 d t t δ t v d t a t t δ t ω d t the time integration was solved using an interpolation integral formula with second order accuracy when the body moved with the computed step size the flow also adapted to this motion 3 3 the hric scheme the critical issue in the application of the vof multiphase model was the discretization of the convection term in eq 1 a suitable differencing scheme had to meet the criteria that follow 1 sharpness criterion the interface with volume fractions values between 0 and 1 had to be limited to a small area and non physical mixing had to be suppressed 2 boundness criterion overshoots or undershoots of the volume fraction bounded by zero and unity had to be avoided upwind schemes tend to produce numerical diffusion which impair the sharpness of the interface high order schemes are prone to the numerical dispersion generating unphysical oscillations exceeding the boundary thus common differencing schemes would fail to satisfy the two criteria leading to spurious solutions or computation divergence the well designed hric scheme is capable of reducing the numerical diffusion and unphysical oscillations which is extensively used in the hydrodynamic assessment of planing hulls the underlying discretization scheme for the improved vof method proposed in this paper series was the hric scheme and the applicability of the scheme was illustrated in this section the first order upwind fou scheme was also discussed as the scheme played an important part in the hric scheme to give a better representation of the schemes a theoretical test case of multiphase flow on square meshes was presented to simplify the calculation the governing equation in the test case was only the vof equation the velocity and the working pressure were assumed to be constant and the velocity was perpendicular to the edge of the meshes in other words the test case was used to simulate the transport of the volume fraction with constant velocity although the case was simple it was similar to the flow field in the first layer near wall cells of the pa of a high speed planing hull in the absence of the velocity normal to the hull the mesh and the initial conditions are shown in fig 9 the figures inside and below the cells in the image are the values of the volume fraction of water and the serial number of cells respectively an unphysical phase was set in cell 7 co is the courant friedrich lewy cfl number which represents the number of cells traveled by a particle of fluid within a time step defined as 6 c o v δ t h where v is the local velocity in a specific direction for the convenience of expressing the surface fluxes of the schemes the position of the downwind central and upwind cells in the vicinity of a cell face f are presented in fig 10 the volume fraction values are labeled α d α c and α u respectively and α f denotes the volume fraction flux of the face f green line in fig 10 for the fou scheme the approximated surface flux α f could be expressed by 7 α f α c where α c is shown in fig 10 the surface flux of the fou scheme was completely determined by the adjacent upstream cells and numerical diffusion was therefore produced which smeared the interface over a number of cells fig 11 shows the solutions of the first seven time steps of the test case one can see that the computed results were evidently unphysical the two immiscible fluids were mixed over a large number of cells hence the sharpness criterion could not be satisfied although the numerical diffusion limited the accuracy of the fou scheme it produced considerable stability which rendered the scheme unconditionally bounded thus the boundness criterion could be satisfied by the scheme the widely used hric scheme was specifically designed to approximate the convection of the volume fraction the scheme non linearly blended the downwind and upwind schemes to determine the surface flux of the volume fraction α f which could be written in the form 8 α f ξ f ξ c α d α u α u where α is as shown in fig 10 and ξ c α c α u α d α u if α d α u α f α c ξ f is the function of ξ c used to dictate the blending defined as follows when the local courant number is small enough 9 ξ f ξ c ξ c ξ c 0 o r 1 ξ c 2 ξ c 0 ξ c 0 5 1 0 5 ξ c 1 then eq 8 can be transformed into 10 α f α c ξ c 0 o r 1 ξ c 1 2 ξ c 1 ξ c α c ξ c 1 ξ c α d 0 ξ c 0 5 α d 0 5 ξ c 1 based on this function when α c exceeded the bounds min α d α u max α d α u i e ξ c 0 or ξ c 1 the surface flux α f was equal to that of the fou scheme see eq 7 which introduced artificial diffusion to eliminate the oscillation exceeding the bounds when α c was locally bounded between α d and α u 0 ξ c 1 the influence of the downstream cells on the determination of the surface flux was increased to suppress the numerical diffusion enabling the interface to be sharp rather than be smeared fig 12 shows the solutions of the test case in the first seven time steps obtained through the hric scheme the sharpness of the interface was basically maintained showing a large improvement compared with the fou scheme the unphysical phase in cell 7 was also dissipated by the introduction of the fou scheme thus a relatively reasonable volume fraction distribution could be achieved the three criteria could be basically satisfied by the scheme because of the considerable reduction of the numerical diffusion and the unphysical oscillations the interface orientation was also taken into account by the scheme which has been omitted for simplicity the details are shown elsewhere muzaferija and peri 1998 the hric scheme was proved satisfactory in most applications but the treatment of the nv needed further perfection although numerical diffusion can be reduced to maintain the interface sharpness the unphysical transport of air could not be prevented additionally if the number of the cells with unphysical results exceeded a certain level black circle in fig 13 they would be transported continually rather than be dissipated by the introduced fou scheme shown in fig 13 the transport embodied the prevention of the numerical diffusion of the scheme but the inappropriately maintained unphysical phase might have caused the nv although the included downwind approximation of the hric scheme benefited the interface sharpness it might have drained more fluid than what was available in the donor cell causing convergence problems when the local courant number was too large to maintain stability the following correction was deployed by the hric scheme 11 ξ f ξ f c o c o l ξ c ξ f ξ c c o u c o c o u c o l c o l c o c o u ξ c c o u c o where co l and co u are user defined coefficients and ξ f is the corrected ξ f when the local courant number co was less than co l the ξ f was still determined through eq 9 if the value of co was larger than that of co u the fou was adopted to improve the robustness for co l co co u the blending of the upwind and the pure hric scheme eq 10 controlled by the courant number was used small values of co l and co u were advantageous for convergence especially for the case when a large time variation of the free surface existed resulting from a sooner activation of the fou scheme which unconditionally obeyed the bound however the numerical diffusion introduced by the fou scheme always smudged the interface causing numerical ventilation and loss of precision the value of co l of the original hric scheme was 0 3 muzaferija and peri 1998 while the recommended time step by ittc 2014 for implicit ship cfd generally led to a local courant number larger than unity which introduced numerical diffusion and aggravated the nv 4 the anti ventilation techniques to eliminate the nv and speed up convergence anti ventilation techniques were developed the theory and application procedure of the techniques are given in this section 4 1 necessary theory the anti ventilation techniques were designed to counteract the unphysical transport of air see fig 6 and dissipate unphysical phases see fig 13 in the identified near wall cells of the pa the values of the volume fraction of the pa had to be unity hence an artificial diffusion term was introduced to the vof equation of the pa that only allowed upstream diffusive fluxes to prevent the air from being unphysically transported into the pa and dissipating the unphysical results after introducing the diffusion term the vof equation of the pa was transformed into 12 t α v i d v transient term α s i v d s convection term γ s u p α i d s artificial diffusion term 0 where s up represents the upwind cell faces and г is a diffusion coefficient the gradient of the α i was discretized using the green gauss method considering the hric scheme without stability correction in eq 11 the modified surface fluxes α f including the convective fluxes approximated by the hric scheme and diffusive fluxes of the volume fraction after the employment of the diffusion term were as follows 13 α f α f convective fluxes γ α c α d diffusive fluxes for the pressure area α f convective fluxes for other areas after substituting α f into eq 10 eq 13 could be transformed into 14 α f c o c 1 α c c 2 α d γ α c α d for the pressure area c o c 1 α c c 2 α d for other areas where c 1 and c 2 are two positive coefficients determined by ξ c and c 1 c 2 1 г is a dimensionless coefficient defined as 15 γ γ δ t h 2 fig 15 shows the comparison between the computed volume fraction of water of a test case using the anti ventilation techniques with different г values the test case was similar to that described in section 3 3 the time step 1 was the initial condition and the value of co was 0 5 the case could be regarded as a simplified flow in the first layer of near wall cells see fig 14 for which the longitudinal volume fraction transport tangent to the hull was molded but the transport normal to the hull was neglected cells 7 35 were assumed to be near wall cells within the pa of a planing hull cell 7 of which was assumed to be the pressure center the unphysical air was set in cells 10 14 of the initial condition the elimination of the air phase depended on the water transported through the bottom face which was neglected thus the air phase was transported into the pa through the pressure center when no techniques were used to suppress the transport of air г 0 and the unphysical phase in cells 7 35 was maintained with the increasing of the г value the transport of the unphysical phase was gradually suppressed and the dissipation of the unphysical phase also increased when the г value exceeded the value of co the modified hric scheme succeeded in retaining the water phase of the pa within 30 time steps and numerical ventilation was completely avoided to satisfy the sharpness and boundness criteria an appropriate value of г had to be set obviously when the г value was larger than or equal to that of co namely when the diffusive fluxes were not less than the convective fluxes the sharpness criterion was satisfied with the advancement of the time step as for the boundness criteria they were also satisfied under this condition for the proof α f of eq 10 could be expressed by c 1 α c c 2 α d a blending of the upwind and downwind values the included upwind scheme was unconditionally bounded which has been widely proven however the included downwind approximation of the hric scheme to maintain sharpness might produce instability since the surface fluxes of the downwind approximation could not take the available amount of the donor cell into account thus the most unstable form of α f was α d then the surface flux α f in eq 14 for pa was 16 α f c o α d γ α c γ α d γ α c γ c o α d considering a three dimensional case the discrete form of eq 12 could be written as 17 α i j k m 1 α i j k m n 1 3 γ α i j k n u m 1 2 γ c o n α i j k m 1 γ c o n α i j k n d m 1 where the subscripts i j and k are the serial numbers of the grid cell in the three directions and the superscript m represents the serial numbers of the time step co n represents the courant number in the direction n and i j k n u and i j k n d represent the adjacent upwind and downwind cells respectively in the direction n of the cell with the serial numbers i j k for instance i j k n u i 1 j k in the i direction eq 17 can be transformed to 18 α i j k m 1 n 1 3 γ α i j k n u m 1 1 n 1 3 2 γ c o n n 1 3 γ c o n α i j k n d m 1 1 n 1 3 2 γ c o n α i j k m 1 n 1 3 2 γ c o n for simplicity the denominator was represented by ct when the г value was larger than the co value in all directions the following relationship could be obtained 19 sup i j k α i j k m 1 sup i j k n 1 3 γ α i j k n u m 1 c t sup i j k n 1 3 γ c o n α i j k n d m 1 c t sup i j k α i j k m c t sup i j k α i j k m 1 sup i j k n 1 3 γ α i j k n u m 1 c t sup i j k n 1 3 γ c o n α i j k n d m 1 c t sup i j k α i j k m c t c t sup i j k α i j k m 1 c t n 1 3 γ sup i j k α i j k n u m 1 c t n 1 3 γ c o n sup i j k α i j k n d m 1 c t sup i j k α i j k m c t sup i j k α i j k m 1 c t sup i j k α i j k m c t sup i j k α i j k m 1 sup i j k α i j k m sup α i j k 0 1 where α i j k 0 is the initial condition that obeyed the bounds similarly the following relationship could be obtained 20 inf j α i j k m 1 inf j α i j k 0 0 therefore 0 α i j k m 1 1 which ended the proof in practice the г value was not necessarily larger than the co value in order to suppress the nv because of the presence of the water phase from the bottom face omitted in the test case and the diffusion term always benefited the boundness and robustness regardless of the value of г for the test case when г co the modified hric scheme was bounded irrespective of the time step selected any co value was appropriate for maintaining stability although the unconditionally stability might not have been achieved in the complicated three dimensional multiphase flow the diffusion term could reduce the dependence on the courant number namely a larger time step could be tolerated nevertheless sufficient time resolution for the flow fields still needed to be guaranteed after suppressing the unphysical transport of air the computed phase distribution of the sa and spray phenomenon was also improved the details are given in section 2 3 additionally the intuitive and modular method was applicable for all of the underlying vof discretization schemes based on the fvm that were used to obtain a reasonable phase distribution of a planing hull furthermore the diffusion term was introduced to the near wall cells of a planing hull for which hexahedral meshes were arranged along the flow direction see fig 14 hence the relative positions were easy to determine for both the structured and unstructured cells 4 2 application procedure based on the anti ventilation techniques a systematic procedure for the hydrodynamic assessment of high speed planing hulls was developed the hric scheme was adopted as the discretization scheme for the vof equation two degrees of freedom of the ship motions were allowed to account for trim and sinkage the running attitude of the high speed planing hull was highly correlated with its hydrodynamic characteristics while the process before the planing hull reached an equilibrium position was not of interest to reduce the computational time spent on the achievement of the quasi steady state a relatively big time step and the conventional vof method were adopted to speed up the convergence of ship motions the fou scheme was employed to maintain robustness the unconditional stability of which has been widely proven although the scheme might have introduced numerical diffusion it was suitable for obtaining an initial solution rapidly using a large time step because of its unconditional stability this process was named the preliminary calculation after this process a small time step the improved vof method were used to obtain the final converged solution and the ship motion could quickly converge as the quasi steady state achieved in last process acted as an initial running attitude in this process which was close to the final converged running attitude this process was named the final calculation the identification of the near wall cells of the pa where the diffusion term was introduced was an essential prerequisite for the systematic procedure the pa was located behind the pressure center with a maximum static pressure so the pa could be identified through the following procedure named the id procedure 1 create an appropriate ship based coordinate system 2 obtain the pressure and corresponding coordinates along some buttock lines 3 output the coordinates with the maximum pressure of every buttock line 4 use the quadratic uniform b spline curves to fit the pressure center 5 identify the pa located behind the pressure center fig 16 shows the whole application procedure of the anti ventilation techniques for simplicity only the solving of the vof and motion equations was included in the flow chart and variables such as the velocity and pressure were updated as normal the solution from the previous time step served as the initial condition for the next time step when the ship motion converged in the preliminary calculation the quasi steady state equilibrium running attitude of the hull could be obtained acting as an initial running attitude in the final calculation the nv introduced in the preliminary calculation was eliminated in the reinitialization for which the volume fraction of water in the pa was redefined as unity the density dynamic viscosity and other related quantities were also updated to match the new volume fraction field offering a more appropriate initial condition for the final calculation the final calculation was aimed at a more accurate and final converged solution within each time step the iterative procedure identified the pa moving with trim and sinkage and changed the target area of the anti ventilation techniques according to the new position of the pa the volume fraction of water of the area could remain at unity as a result of the artificial diffusion term conversely the trim and sinkage were also influenced by the updated phase distribution in the pa and the above steps were repeated until the computation converged after a certain number of iterations of the final calculation the nv was completely eliminated and the accuracy of the hydrodynamic characteristic prediction could be significantly improved 5 conclusion the hydrodynamic assessment of the planing hulls was severely affected by the nv the predicted resistance running attitude wetted surface spray and ship wave making phenomena could be affected the formation process of the nv involved unphysical air entry to the wetted surface through the pressure center and the unphysical transport of the nv in the wetted surface and the nv was always aggravated by numerical diffusion any underlying vof discretization scheme was prone to the nv the widely used hric scheme was capable of reducing the numerical diffusion but the unphysical air entry and the unphysical transport could not be avoided to eliminate the nv a diffusion term was introduced to the vof equation of the pa to prevent the unphysical air entry and dissipate the unphysical phase in the wetted surface and the term also benefited the boundness and stability no special techniques were implemented in the sa where the flow field was very complex while the capture of this area could also be improved by the diffusion term because the volume fraction of water transported into the area can be more physical when the unphysical air entry was suppressed similarly the spray phenomenon also benefited based on the anti ventilation techniques a systematic procedure for the hydrodynamic assessment of planing hulls was developed to improve the accuracy and to speed up the convergence the application and validation cases are presented in part 2 of this paper series credit authorship contribution statement lianzheng cui investigation methodology software formal

20350,the numerical prediction of the hydrodynamic characteristics for planing hulls has always been challenging due to numerical ventilation nv which is the unphysical entrainment of air under a hull the capture of the wetted surface the pressure distribution the spray and wave making phenomena may suffer from this in this paper series the characteristics of the nv were analyzed and anti ventilation techniques based on the volume of fluid vof method were developed and applied the nv was formed by the unphysically transported air phase in the wetted surface to counteract the unphysical transport pseudo diffusive fluxes in specific directions were introduced by adding an artificial diffusion term to the vof equation for the pressure area pa the unphysical results caused by other numerical issues could also be dissipated by this term the boundness of the underlying discretization scheme for the modified vof equation was proved by stability analysis based on the anti ventilation techniques a novel systematic procedure for the hydrodynamic assessment of planing hulls was developed to improve the accuracy stability and convergence rate part 1 of this paper series

area created by the whisker spray 1 introduction planing hulls one type of high speed marine vehicle hsmv have wide military and civilian uses under the action of hydrodynamic lift the running attitude of a planing hull varies demonstrably with the speed a planing hull will be carried out of the water in a high speed planing mode and the impingement and spray of the high speed free stream will produce complicated and unsteady flow phenomena the prediction of the hydrodynamic performances of planing hulls is one of the most challenging areas of ship hydrodynamics early research on high speed planing hulls was mainly conducted with model tests which could provide macroscopic quantities with high accuracy but this type of research is costly and the detailed flow characteristics are hard to capture the regression empirical and semi empirical formulae based on test results are more economical for prediction but these methods lack wide applicability the accuracy of the results depends heavily on the similarity between the object of computation and the ship models the formulae are based on with the advancement of computing resources numerical methods have been widely used to predict the hydrodynamic performance of planing hulls the potential flow and reynolds averaged navier stokes rans methods are two dominant numerical methods for the potential flow methods the governing equations are solved only on the boundary according to the properties of green s second identity thus the boundary elements method bem can be used to solve the equations resulting in fewer meshes the two dimensional plus time dependent theory 2d t munk 1924 based on bem is a widely used method of potential flow theory tulin 1957 applied the theory to slender planing surfaces ogilvie 1967 and chapman 1976 considered the effects of gravity and nonlinear free surfaces conditions respectively in 2d t methods after this some numerical research on hydrodynamic characteristics of planing hulls using 2d t methods was published zhao and faltinsen 1993 vorus 1996 zhao et al 1997 sun and faltinsen 2011 tavakoli and dashtimanesh 2018 bilandi et al 2020 although potential flow methods can improve the computation efficiency as a result of fewer meshes and unknowns the assumptions used to simplify the governing equations limit applicability numerical errors are inevitable where nonlinear and viscous effects are evident chen and lee 1999 took the viscous effect into account presenting an interactive rans laplace coupling method to predict the flow field around a series 60 ship hull the nonlinear free surface of the far field was resolved by laplace equations the kinematic and dynamic conditions were satisfied and only the water phase was solved with rans in the near wall region the free surface fluctuations were hard to capture for this hybrid method for the present computational techniques the rans method with the finite volume method fvm or finite difference method fdm discretization has become the most extensively used approach a crucial issue is the treatment of a free surface which can be divided into interface tracking methods and interface capturing methods most of the former methods are not applicable for unstructured meshes and they are limited to flows with a relatively smooth interface the free surfaces of unsteady viscous flow around a planing hull have always been resolved with the interface capturing method hino et al 1991 developed a finite difference method for inviscid flow with a free surface to simulate the two phase flow around a planing hull and the nonlinear free surface was captured with the maker and cell mac method harlow and welch 1965 in which the location of the free surface was determined by the distribution of the marker particles the mac method can treat complex and unsteady flow phenomena but it is computationally expensive due to the large number of maker particles and the special treatment for the distribution of the makers burg 2005 employed the level set ls method incorporated within an incompressible rans solver to study the flow field around series 60 hull forms the flow was simulated with a fixed mesh where the level set function evolved carrica et al 2007 analyzed the hydrodynamic characteristics of a surface ship free to pitch and heave using the ls method and the rigid overset mesh moving with the ship motion was adopted the ls method is more economic than the mac method but it is not mass conservative another efficient method is the vof methodology hirt and nichols 1981 a simple and mass conservative interface capturing method that can be applied to the capture of a complex free surface the governing equation of the method is a transport equation for the volume fraction of one eulerian phase the discretization scheme for the convective term of the equation is critical for the free surface capture which can be categorized into geometry reconstruction and algebraic schemes the algebraic schemes offer a better compromise between accuracy and computational cost and they are more applicable for engineering calculation the compressive interface capturing scheme for arbitrary meshes cicsam ubbink 1997 and the high resolution interface capturing hric scheme muzaferija and peri 1998 are two frequently used algebraic schemes for studying the flow field around a high speed planing hull table 1 lists some numerical research on planing hulls after the year 2000 as well as the selected discretization schemes for the vof equation the cicsam scheme is highly non diffusive but unphysical results may be generated at the interface the hric scheme based on the normalized variable diagram leonard 1997 has become the predominant approach used to predict the hydrodynamic performance of planing hulls and it is employed by most of the common commercial cfd software programs as the recommended algebraic scheme because of its satisfactory efficiency and accuracy details are provided in section 3 3 nevertheless the prediction using the rans and vof methods still suffers from numerical ventilation nv which is the unphysical entrainment of air under the hull the influences of the nv on the hydrodynamic assessment of planing hulls were discussed in section 2 1 to suppress the nv and improve the prediction accuracy some remedies for the problem have been presented böhm and graf 2014 removed the courant friedrich lewy cfl dependency of the hric scheme to achieve high resolution without any compromise of robustness the method was applicable for seeking a steady state solution when the flow unsteadiness was not evident lee and rhee 2015 applied a novel interface compression method to counteract numerical ventilation by adding an artificial compression term into the vof equation the interface compression method was effective for avoiding numerical diffusion but numerical diffusion was not the root cause of the nv similarly some interface sharpening methods so et al 2011 malgarinos et al 2015 nguyen and park 2017 nguyen et al 2018 for avoiding numerical diffusion cannot completely eliminate the nv viola et al 2012 and wheeler et al 2018 introduced a source term to extract the air phase under the hull avci and barlas 2018 eliminated the unphysical phase under the hull using an artificial phase replacement method although the nv can be reduced the methods were not mass conservative de luca et al 2016 and the nv was not eradicated which may reappear with the advancement of the time step nimmagadda et al 2020 aimed to suppress the unphysical phenomena through special care taken in setting the cfl limits mesh refinement and the coefficients of the hric scheme the prediction accuracy was improved but the method might be too computationally expensive and not widely applicable in summary the rans methods with the vof multiphase treatment method have become the dominant approach for predicting the hydrodynamic characteristics of planing hulls but the accuracies of the predictions have been severely affected by the nv existing numerical methods for eliminating the nv lack extensive applicability and they have difficulty eradicating the sources of the nv and maintaining stability simultaneously thus it is necessary to figure out the formation of the nv and to develop anti ventilation techniques that are capable of eliminating the nv reliably and efficiently achieving higher prediction accuracy in part 1 of this paper series the formation process of the nv was analyzed in terms of the transport of volume fraction based on the finite volume method fvm based on the analyses anti ventilation techniques were developed to eliminate the nv and theoretical test cases were used to demonstrate the elimination effects of the techniques the vof equation was discretized by the hric scheme the boundness of the underlying discretization scheme for the modified vof equation by the anti ventilation techniques was proven with stability analysis based on the anti ventilation techniques a systematic procedure for the hydrodynamic assessment of a planing hull was developed with the aims of achieving high prediction accuracy enhancing the stability and speeding up the convergence the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the formation of the nv is analyzed in section 2 section 3 provides the details of the numerical methods employed in this research the anti ventilation techniques developed in this paper are given in section 4 the conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 formation of numerical ventilation the influences and formation process of the nv was examined the effect of the numerical diffusion on the formation of the nv was analyzed 2 1 overview fig 1 presents the flow details on the bottom of the planing hull the wetted surface could be divided into two regions the pressure area pa and the spray area sa the stagnation line was the boundary between the two areas the high speed freestreams were lashed at a hull surface and some of them were reflected to the chines of the hull the whisker spray was formed by the reflection therefore the stagnation line was always referred to as the spray root line the pressure center was located at the vicinity of the line since the velocity of the freestream relative to the hull at the stagnation line was zero and the pressure attained its maximum value the sa was caused by the whisker spray which increased the wetted surface of the high speed planing hull the pa was aft of the pressure center providing most of the hydrodynamic lift which determined the running attitude of the planing hull the phenomenon of the nv may occur in both the sa and the pa seriously affecting the hydrodynamic characteristics prediction of planing hulls fig 2 böhm and graf 2014 shows the volume fraction of water of a hull surface as shown in the figure the volume fraction of water values generally ranged from zero to unity instead of being zero or unity the volume fraction was evidently under predicted due to the nv the capture of the region located in front of the wetted surface is the most prone to the nv as a result of the proximity of the region to the interface and the complex flow there fig 3 matveev and morabito 2020 shows the volume fraction of the bottom of a planing hull with a negative deadrise angle as shown in the figure the water phase extending forward to the gas phase of the impingement area black circle in was smudged which manifested the effect of the nv due to the weighted average method of the vof method in the determination of fluid properties the kinematic viscosity coefficient and the density will be erroneously calculated when the nv exists causing an under prediction of the viscous resistance furthermore the accuracy of the pressure resistance prediction can also be impaired fig 4 lotfi et al 2015 de marco et al 2017 nimmagadda et al 2020 shows the spray phenomena of running planing hulls the volume fraction of water of the spray phenomena was evidently less than unity an under estimation of the spray pressure resistance might have been caused the effect of the nv on the wave making resistance was discussed by böhm and graf 2014 and they found that the wave damping could be increased by the nv leading to a prediction of lower wave making resistance the pressure resistance was highly related to the hydrodynamic lift since the two types of forces were components of the pressure under the hull thus under predicted pressure resistance indicates a lower hydrodynamic lift additionally erroneously calculated fluid properties can also further reduce the computed lift as a result the running attitude which has a significant influence on the hydrodynamic performances of planing hulls will be erroneously predicted in summary the prediction of the hydrodynamic characteristics of planing hulls is affected severely by the nv the relative errors of the predicted hydrodynamic characteristics in the literatures are presented in part 2 of this paper series this part is mainly focused on the formation of the nv and the methods for eliminating it fig 5 shows the phase distribution and streamlines around a planing hull when this type of multiphase flow around a hsmv planing on a water surface with a trim angle is resolved through a conventional vof method the nv is almost inevitable since the air between the hull bottom and the free surface always tends to be transported into the wetted surface through the corner black circle in fig 5 and any underlying vof discretization scheme is prone to the unphysical transport the formation of the nv could be divided into two parts unphysical air entry to the wetted surface and transport of the unphysical phase in the wetted surface including the sa and pa which will be discussed subsequently furthermore the nv was always aggravated by numerical diffusion that implicit and upwind bias schemes tend to produce hence the influence of the numerical diffusion was also analyzed 2 2 unphysical air entry the air under the hull gained entry to the wetted surface through the pressure center located in the black circle in fig 5 side view where the free stream impinged on the hull fig 6 shows the water distribution near the pressure center i e the zoomed in view of the black circle in fig 5 considering the first layer near wall cell which was forward of the pressure center the faces edges in the side view of which are bold in fig 6 the near wall cells always lie within the log layer of the boundary layer to save the number of cells for high reynolds number flow thus the velocity of the cell was not zero leading to the phase transport through the faces of the cell the transport of the eulerian phases in the near wall cell is also shown in fig 6 the fluxes normal to the longitudinal section were omitted for convenience since their magnitudes were very small the faces on the left and bottom were the upwind sides where the air and water phases were transported into the cells although the transport of the air was unphysical the process could not be identified by the vof method since the two phases shared the same velocity and the immiscibility was unable to be accounted for an accurate capture for the phases of the pressure center demanded that the transport of water from the bottom face be overwhelmingly dominant which could preserve the water phase of the pressure center the mesh and the time step had an influence on the process for the design of the mesh the small aspect ratio was advantageous for the preservation of the water since the transport of water through the bottom face could be more dominant the decrease of the aspect ratio could be achieved by increasing the cell length along the longitudinal direction and or reducing the height of the first layer grid the former would have led to the insufficient resolution of the flow details along the hull especially for the pressure center with pronounced pressure gradient and the latter would have caused an undesirable rise in the near wall cells decreasing the size of the time step was also advantageous for the preservation but the required computation resources would increase accordingly when no special means were adopted to suppress the unphysical transport the air entered the wetted surface due to the high velocity of the air causing the nv in most cases the unphysical phase was always concentrated on the first cells of the boundary layer shown in fig 6 because of the upward transported water 2 3 unphysical air transport after the unphysical air entry for the wetted surface the phase transport was in two halves see fig 1 the downwind transport in the pa shown in fig 6 and the transport into the sa with the action of reflection the air phase transported in the pa was retained until the phase reached the stern since the velocity of this area was essentially tangent to the hull surface and no water phase was transported upward see fig 5 consequently the unphysical phases that came from the pressure center or caused by any numerical issue were transported downwind and the process took a relatively long time as a result of the low velocity of the near wall cells the unphysical results might have appeared constantly and irregularly hence the final converged results could be affected for the transport in the sa located above the free surface the process was relatively complicated fig 7 shows the bottom view of the eulerian phases transport in a cell forward of the sa see the red rectangle in fig 1 the phase transported upward was not expressed since the velocity of the pa was almost tangent to the hull and there was hardly any phase transported in the direction normal to the hull the phase transported into the cell was from the pressure center and the freestream of air the unphysical air included in the phase from the pressure center and the air of the freestream made the accurate capture of the water phase of the sa hard to achieve moreover the unphysical air included in the wetted surface was transported into the main spray causing a reduced volume fraction of water of the spray phenomenon shown in fig 4 reducing the air entry in the pressure center benefited the capture of the pa sa and spray because the proportion of water in the liquid transported into the wetted surface could be increased since the reduction was hard to achieve with the design of the mesh and the time step an effective numerical method was necessary in practice the nv is always aggravated by numerical diffusion which produced the unphysical mixing between the air and the water fig 8 shows the phase distribution being affected by the numerical diffusion on the longitudinal section in the center plane one can see that the interface between different phases was evidently smeared and the unphysical air was not only limited in the first layer of the near wall cells numerical diffusion is quite common when upwind differencing schemes or implicit schemes are used to discretize the vof equation therefore suppressing numerical diffusion is an essential prerequisite for a differencing scheme to eliminate the nv 3 numerical models the vof method the governing equations for ship motions and the widely used hric scheme based on rans equations are presented in this section 3 1 the vof method the vof method hirt and nichols 1981 was used to predict the distribution and movement of the free surface this method is more flexible and efficient than the other free surface treatment methods since no boundary conditions are prescribed at the interface and no grid nodes movement or marker particles are needed for the determination of the free surface position different phases share the same pressure and velocity and the set of mass and momentum conservation equations for the phases are the same ignoring the source term the transport equations of the volume fraction α i of phase i in a control volume v is as follows 1 t α v i d v transient term α s i v d s convection term 0 where v is the velocity vector and s is the surface of the control volume the density ρ and the dynamic viscosity μ are calculated according to a weighted average and they are given by 2 ρ i ρ i α i μ i ρ i μ i where ρ i and μ i are the density and the dynamic viscosity of phase i in this paper series the fully implicit euler method was selected as the temporal discretization scheme for eq 1 because of its robustness furthermore implicit schemes producing more numerical diffusion than explicit schemes can better embody the ability of the anti ventilation techniques to maintain the sharpness of the interface 3 2 governing equations for ship motions the ship motions were modeled by two degrees of freedom equations including the trim and sinkage the sinkage was calculated with an equation for the translation of the center of mass 3 m d v d t c t f p f a f f τ f a f m g where m is the mass of the ship p f and τ f are the pressure and the shear stress on face f respectively and a f and a f are the area vector and the area of face f respectively c t is a time ramping function ranging from zero to unity the value of zero allowed the flow field to initialize before the ship moved and the values increased from zero to unity to enable the resultant force and moment acting on the ship to increase proportionally facilitating a more robust solution with less oscillations the trim was determined using an equation of rotation of the ship 4 m d ω d t ω m ω f r f p f a f f r f τ f a f f r f m f g where m is the tensor of the moments of inertia ω is the angular velocity and r f is the distance vector from the body center of mass to the center of face f the forces and the moments acting on the body were updated at the end of each inner iteration and time step the translation step size d and the rotation step size a were calculated at the end of a time step 5 d t t δ t v d t a t t δ t ω d t the time integration was solved using an interpolation integral formula with second order accuracy when the body moved with the computed step size the flow also adapted to this motion 3 3 the hric scheme the critical issue in the application of the vof multiphase model was the discretization of the convection term in eq 1 a suitable differencing scheme had to meet the criteria that follow 1 sharpness criterion the interface with volume fractions values between 0 and 1 had to be limited to a small area and non physical mixing had to be suppressed 2 boundness criterion overshoots or undershoots of the volume fraction bounded by zero and unity had to be avoided upwind schemes tend to produce numerical diffusion which impair the sharpness of the interface high order schemes are prone to the numerical dispersion generating unphysical oscillations exceeding the boundary thus common differencing schemes would fail to satisfy the two criteria leading to spurious solutions or computation divergence the well designed hric scheme is capable of reducing the numerical diffusion and unphysical oscillations which is extensively used in the hydrodynamic assessment of planing hulls the underlying discretization scheme for the improved vof method proposed in this paper series was the hric scheme and the applicability of the scheme was illustrated in this section the first order upwind fou scheme was also discussed as the scheme played an important part in the hric scheme to give a better representation of the schemes a theoretical test case of multiphase flow on square meshes was presented to simplify the calculation the governing equation in the test case was only the vof equation the velocity and the working pressure were assumed to be constant and the velocity was perpendicular to the edge of the meshes in other words the test case was used to simulate the transport of the volume fraction with constant velocity although the case was simple it was similar to the flow field in the first layer near wall cells of the pa of a high speed planing hull in the absence of the velocity normal to the hull the mesh and the initial conditions are shown in fig 9 the figures inside and below the cells in the image are the values of the volume fraction of water and the serial number of cells respectively an unphysical phase was set in cell 7 co is the courant friedrich lewy cfl number which represents the number of cells traveled by a particle of fluid within a time step defined as 6 c o v δ t h where v is the local velocity in a specific direction for the convenience of expressing the surface fluxes of the schemes the position of the downwind central and upwind cells in the vicinity of a cell face f are presented in fig 10 the volume fraction values are labeled α d α c and α u respectively and α f denotes the volume fraction flux of the face f green line in fig 10 for the fou scheme the approximated surface flux α f could be expressed by 7 α f α c where α c is shown in fig 10 the surface flux of the fou scheme was completely determined by the adjacent upstream cells and numerical diffusion was therefore produced which smeared the interface over a number of cells fig 11 shows the solutions of the first seven time steps of the test case one can see that the computed results were evidently unphysical the two immiscible fluids were mixed over a large number of cells hence the sharpness criterion could not be satisfied although the numerical diffusion limited the accuracy of the fou scheme it produced considerable stability which rendered the scheme unconditionally bounded thus the boundness criterion could be satisfied by the scheme the widely used hric scheme was specifically designed to approximate the convection of the volume fraction the scheme non linearly blended the downwind and upwind schemes to determine the surface flux of the volume fraction α f which could be written in the form 8 α f ξ f ξ c α d α u α u where α is as shown in fig 10 and ξ c α c α u α d α u if α d α u α f α c ξ f is the function of ξ c used to dictate the blending defined as follows when the local courant number is small enough 9 ξ f ξ c ξ c ξ c 0 o r 1 ξ c 2 ξ c 0 ξ c 0 5 1 0 5 ξ c 1 then eq 8 can be transformed into 10 α f α c ξ c 0 o r 1 ξ c 1 2 ξ c 1 ξ c α c ξ c 1 ξ c α d 0 ξ c 0 5 α d 0 5 ξ c 1 based on this function when α c exceeded the bounds min α d α u max α d α u i e ξ c 0 or ξ c 1 the surface flux α f was equal to that of the fou scheme see eq 7 which introduced artificial diffusion to eliminate the oscillation exceeding the bounds when α c was locally bounded between α d and α u 0 ξ c 1 the influence of the downstream cells on the determination of the surface flux was increased to suppress the numerical diffusion enabling the interface to be sharp rather than be smeared fig 12 shows the solutions of the test case in the first seven time steps obtained through the hric scheme the sharpness of the interface was basically maintained showing a large improvement compared with the fou scheme the unphysical phase in cell 7 was also dissipated by the introduction of the fou scheme thus a relatively reasonable volume fraction distribution could be achieved the three criteria could be basically satisfied by the scheme because of the considerable reduction of the numerical diffusion and the unphysical oscillations the interface orientation was also taken into account by the scheme which has been omitted for simplicity the details are shown elsewhere muzaferija and peri 1998 the hric scheme was proved satisfactory in most applications but the treatment of the nv needed further perfection although numerical diffusion can be reduced to maintain the interface sharpness the unphysical transport of air could not be prevented additionally if the number of the cells with unphysical results exceeded a certain level black circle in fig 13 they would be transported continually rather than be dissipated by the introduced fou scheme shown in fig 13 the transport embodied the prevention of the numerical diffusion of the scheme but the inappropriately maintained unphysical phase might have caused the nv although the included downwind approximation of the hric scheme benefited the interface sharpness it might have drained more fluid than what was available in the donor cell causing convergence problems when the local courant number was too large to maintain stability the following correction was deployed by the hric scheme 11 ξ f ξ f c o c o l ξ c ξ f ξ c c o u c o c o u c o l c o l c o c o u ξ c c o u c o where co l and co u are user defined coefficients and ξ f is the corrected ξ f when the local courant number co was less than co l the ξ f was still determined through eq 9 if the value of co was larger than that of co u the fou was adopted to improve the robustness for co l co co u the blending of the upwind and the pure hric scheme eq 10 controlled by the courant number was used small values of co l and co u were advantageous for convergence especially for the case when a large time variation of the free surface existed resulting from a sooner activation of the fou scheme which unconditionally obeyed the bound however the numerical diffusion introduced by the fou scheme always smudged the interface causing numerical ventilation and loss of precision the value of co l of the original hric scheme was 0 3 muzaferija and peri 1998 while the recommended time step by ittc 2014 for implicit ship cfd generally led to a local courant number larger than unity which introduced numerical diffusion and aggravated the nv 4 the anti ventilation techniques to eliminate the nv and speed up convergence anti ventilation techniques were developed the theory and application procedure of the techniques are given in this section 4 1 necessary theory the anti ventilation techniques were designed to counteract the unphysical transport of air see fig 6 and dissipate unphysical phases see fig 13 in the identified near wall cells of the pa the values of the volume fraction of the pa had to be unity hence an artificial diffusion term was introduced to the vof equation of the pa that only allowed upstream diffusive fluxes to prevent the air from being unphysically transported into the pa and dissipating the unphysical results after introducing the diffusion term the vof equation of the pa was transformed into 12 t α v i d v transient term α s i v d s convection term γ s u p α i d s artificial diffusion term 0 where s up represents the upwind cell faces and г is a diffusion coefficient the gradient of the α i was discretized using the green gauss method considering the hric scheme without stability correction in eq 11 the modified surface fluxes α f including the convective fluxes approximated by the hric scheme and diffusive fluxes of the volume fraction after the employment of the diffusion term were as follows 13 α f α f convective fluxes γ α c α d diffusive fluxes for the pressure area α f convective fluxes for other areas after substituting α f into eq 10 eq 13 could be transformed into 14 α f c o c 1 α c c 2 α d γ α c α d for the pressure area c o c 1 α c c 2 α d for other areas where c 1 and c 2 are two positive coefficients determined by ξ c and c 1 c 2 1 г is a dimensionless coefficient defined as 15 γ γ δ t h 2 fig 15 shows the comparison between the computed volume fraction of water of a test case using the anti ventilation techniques with different г values the test case was similar to that described in section 3 3 the time step 1 was the initial condition and the value of co was 0 5 the case could be regarded as a simplified flow in the first layer of near wall cells see fig 14 for which the longitudinal volume fraction transport tangent to the hull was molded but the transport normal to the hull was neglected cells 7 35 were assumed to be near wall cells within the pa of a planing hull cell 7 of which was assumed to be the pressure center the unphysical air was set in cells 10 14 of the initial condition the elimination of the air phase depended on the water transported through the bottom face which was neglected thus the air phase was transported into the pa through the pressure center when no techniques were used to suppress the transport of air г 0 and the unphysical phase in cells 7 35 was maintained with the increasing of the г value the transport of the unphysical phase was gradually suppressed and the dissipation of the unphysical phase also increased when the г value exceeded the value of co the modified hric scheme succeeded in retaining the water phase of the pa within 30 time steps and numerical ventilation was completely avoided to satisfy the sharpness and boundness criteria an appropriate value of г had to be set obviously when the г value was larger than or equal to that of co namely when the diffusive fluxes were not less than the convective fluxes the sharpness criterion was satisfied with the advancement of the time step as for the boundness criteria they were also satisfied under this condition for the proof α f of eq 10 could be expressed by c 1 α c c 2 α d a blending of the upwind and downwind values the included upwind scheme was unconditionally bounded which has been widely proven however the included downwind approximation of the hric scheme to maintain sharpness might produce instability since the surface fluxes of the downwind approximation could not take the available amount of the donor cell into account thus the most unstable form of α f was α d then the surface flux α f in eq 14 for pa was 16 α f c o α d γ α c γ α d γ α c γ c o α d considering a three dimensional case the discrete form of eq 12 could be written as 17 α i j k m 1 α i j k m n 1 3 γ α i j k n u m 1 2 γ c o n α i j k m 1 γ c o n α i j k n d m 1 where the subscripts i j and k are the serial numbers of the grid cell in the three directions and the superscript m represents the serial numbers of the time step co n represents the courant number in the direction n and i j k n u and i j k n d represent the adjacent upwind and downwind cells respectively in the direction n of the cell with the serial numbers i j k for instance i j k n u i 1 j k in the i direction eq 17 can be transformed to 18 α i j k m 1 n 1 3 γ α i j k n u m 1 1 n 1 3 2 γ c o n n 1 3 γ c o n α i j k n d m 1 1 n 1 3 2 γ c o n α i j k m 1 n 1 3 2 γ c o n for simplicity the denominator was represented by ct when the г value was larger than the co value in all directions the following relationship could be obtained 19 sup i j k α i j k m 1 sup i j k n 1 3 γ α i j k n u m 1 c t sup i j k n 1 3 γ c o n α i j k n d m 1 c t sup i j k α i j k m c t sup i j k α i j k m 1 sup i j k n 1 3 γ α i j k n u m 1 c t sup i j k n 1 3 γ c o n α i j k n d m 1 c t sup i j k α i j k m c t c t sup i j k α i j k m 1 c t n 1 3 γ sup i j k α i j k n u m 1 c t n 1 3 γ c o n sup i j k α i j k n d m 1 c t sup i j k α i j k m c t sup i j k α i j k m 1 c t sup i j k α i j k m c t sup i j k α i j k m 1 sup i j k α i j k m sup α i j k 0 1 where α i j k 0 is the initial condition that obeyed the bounds similarly the following relationship could be obtained 20 inf j α i j k m 1 inf j α i j k 0 0 therefore 0 α i j k m 1 1 which ended the proof in practice the г value was not necessarily larger than the co value in order to suppress the nv because of the presence of the water phase from the bottom face omitted in the test case and the diffusion term always benefited the boundness and robustness regardless of the value of г for the test case when г co the modified hric scheme was bounded irrespective of the time step selected any co value was appropriate for maintaining stability although the unconditionally stability might not have been achieved in the complicated three dimensional multiphase flow the diffusion term could reduce the dependence on the courant number namely a larger time step could be tolerated nevertheless sufficient time resolution for the flow fields still needed to be guaranteed after suppressing the unphysical transport of air the computed phase distribution of the sa and spray phenomenon was also improved the details are given in section 2 3 additionally the intuitive and modular method was applicable for all of the underlying vof discretization schemes based on the fvm that were used to obtain a reasonable phase distribution of a planing hull furthermore the diffusion term was introduced to the near wall cells of a planing hull for which hexahedral meshes were arranged along the flow direction see fig 14 hence the relative positions were easy to determine for both the structured and unstructured cells 4 2 application procedure based on the anti ventilation techniques a systematic procedure for the hydrodynamic assessment of high speed planing hulls was developed the hric scheme was adopted as the discretization scheme for the vof equation two degrees of freedom of the ship motions were allowed to account for trim and sinkage the running attitude of the high speed planing hull was highly correlated with its hydrodynamic characteristics while the process before the planing hull reached an equilibrium position was not of interest to reduce the computational time spent on the achievement of the quasi steady state a relatively big time step and the conventional vof method were adopted to speed up the convergence of ship motions the fou scheme was employed to maintain robustness the unconditional stability of which has been widely proven although the scheme might have introduced numerical diffusion it was suitable for obtaining an initial solution rapidly using a large time step because of its unconditional stability this process was named the preliminary calculation after this process a small time step the improved vof method were used to obtain the final converged solution and the ship motion could quickly converge as the quasi steady state achieved in last process acted as an initial running attitude in this process which was close to the final converged running attitude this process was named the final calculation the identification of the near wall cells of the pa where the diffusion term was introduced was an essential prerequisite for the systematic procedure the pa was located behind the pressure center with a maximum static pressure so the pa could be identified through the following procedure named the id procedure 1 create an appropriate ship based coordinate system 2 obtain the pressure and corresponding coordinates along some buttock lines 3 output the coordinates with the maximum pressure of every buttock line 4 use the quadratic uniform b spline curves to fit the pressure center 5 identify the pa located behind the pressure center fig 16 shows the whole application procedure of the anti ventilation techniques for simplicity only the solving of the vof and motion equations was included in the flow chart and variables such as the velocity and pressure were updated as normal the solution from the previous time step served as the initial condition for the next time step when the ship motion converged in the preliminary calculation the quasi steady state equilibrium running attitude of the hull could be obtained acting as an initial running attitude in the final calculation the nv introduced in the preliminary calculation was eliminated in the reinitialization for which the volume fraction of water in the pa was redefined as unity the density dynamic viscosity and other related quantities were also updated to match the new volume fraction field offering a more appropriate initial condition for the final calculation the final calculation was aimed at a more accurate and final converged solution within each time step the iterative procedure identified the pa moving with trim and sinkage and changed the target area of the anti ventilation techniques according to the new position of the pa the volume fraction of water of the area could remain at unity as a result of the artificial diffusion term conversely the trim and sinkage were also influenced by the updated phase distribution in the pa and the above steps were repeated until the computation converged after a certain number of iterations of the final calculation the nv was completely eliminated and the accuracy of the hydrodynamic characteristic prediction could be significantly improved 5 conclusion the hydrodynamic assessment of the planing hulls was severely affected by the nv the predicted resistance running attitude wetted surface spray and ship wave making phenomena could be affected the formation process of the nv involved unphysical air entry to the wetted surface through the pressure center and the unphysical transport of the nv in the wetted surface and the nv was always aggravated by numerical diffusion any underlying vof discretization scheme was prone to the nv the widely used hric scheme was capable of reducing the numerical diffusion but the unphysical air entry and the unphysical transport could not be avoided to eliminate the nv a diffusion term was introduced to the vof equation of the pa to prevent the unphysical air entry and dissipate the unphysical phase in the wetted surface and the term also benefited the boundness and stability no special techniques were implemented in the sa where the flow field was very complex while the capture of this area could also be improved by the diffusion term because the volume fraction of water transported into the area can be more physical when the unphysical air entry was suppressed similarly the spray phenomenon also benefited based on the anti ventilation techniques a systematic procedure for the hydrodynamic assessment of planing hulls was developed to improve the accuracy and to speed up the convergence the application and validation cases are presented in part 2 of this paper series credit authorship contribution statement lianzheng cui investigation methodology software formal

20351,the improved volume of fluid vof method proposed in part 1 to eliminate the numerical ventilation nv was applied to predict the hydrodynamic characteristics of an experimentally studied planing hull the simulated ship motions were the trim and sinkage the overset mesh method was employed to avoid undesirable mesh deformation the results of the improved and conventional vof methods were reported and compared with the experimental data the captured wetted surface and spray phenomenon which were prone to the nv were visualized to manifest the advantage of the improved method in capturing them the flow field of the spray area sa which has been rarely numerically studied due to the nv was also investigated to provide a reference for quantifying the spray friction resistance and evaluate some related formulae the comparison demonstrated a considerable accuracy improvement of the improved vof method the visualization also showed a significant elimination effect on the nv the study on the sa indicated that the spray thickness might limit the boundary layer thickness leading to a low reynolds number furthermore the spray thickness and the velocity of the area were not constant which induced the relatively large gradient of the wall shear stress magnitude keywords planing hull hydrodynamic characteristics numerical ventilation volume of fluid diffusion term 1 introduction the numerical prediction of the hydrodynamic characteristics of high speed planing hulls suffers from numerical ventilation nv the unphysical entrainment of air it is of vital importance to eliminate the nv and improve the prediction accuracy in part 1 of this series anti ventilation techniques were developed to achieve the elimination considerable robustness and convergency were also brought about by the techniques hence a larger time step can be tolerated to implement the anti ventilation techniques as well as achieve a more accurate and faster prediction a novel systematic procedure was developed part 1 provides a detailed discussion the systematic procedure was based on the widely utilized reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method with dynamic mesh technique and volume of fluid vof free surface capturing method lotfi et al 2015 presented a three dimensional computational fluid dynamics cfd procedure for a planing hull with a transverse step and the characteristics of the hull were examined jiang et al 2017 developed a viscous cfd simulation procedure for a planing trimaran and the tunnel of the trimaran was investigated ponzini et al 2020 presented a web based tool to perform a numerical simulation of planing hulls which was specially designed to perform automatic cfd simulations of planing hulls the mesh technique plays an important role in the numerical simulation for planing hulls because the large ship motions caused by the hydrodynamic lift tend to result in undesirable mesh deformation which may introduce numerical errors or even lead to computational divergence jahanbakhsh et al 2009 and panahi et al 2009 adopted the boundary fitted body attached mesh to predict hydrodynamic performances of planing hulls and special care was given to avoid the numerical errors and invalid grids caused by the mesh deformation another common dynamic mesh strategy for the numerical prediction is the overset mesh method orihara and miyata 2003 castiglione et al 2011 mousaviraad et al 2015 sukas et al 2017 de marco et al 2017 in which the entire computational domain is enclosed by a background region and a small overset region containing the hull is set up within the domain the overset region is bounded to the hull hence the mesh deformation resulting from the ship s motion can be completely avoided this method provides more accurate motion results and allows for the detection of the nonlinear effect the vof interface capturing method has been widely applied for the multiphase flow model to predict the distribution and movement of the free surface of the flow field around a high speed planing hull the discretization schemes for the transport equation of the volume fraction are critical to achieve an accurate free surface capture the compressive interface capturing scheme for arbitrary meshes cicsam ubbink 1997 and the high resolution interface capturing hric muzaferija and peri 1998 are two commonly used schemes seif et al 2009 calculated the resistance of a planing trimaran using the vof method discretized by the cicam panahi et al 2009 predicted the 3d nonlinear motions of high speed vessels through the vof method with the cicam discretization scheme in recent years the hric scheme has become the more popular discretization scheme for the vof equation because of its reasonable efficiency and accuracy yousefi et al 2014 used the vof method with the hric scheme to predict the hydrodynamic performance of planing hulls with and without the tunnel drag reduction strategy and the results showed that the strategy achieved a 14 reduction in total drag khazaee et al 2019 investigated the hydrodynamic aspects of a planing hull the results were compared against savitsky s method and experimental results the comparison indicated that the rans method with the hric scheme was more accurate and reliable dashtimanesh et al 2020 performed numerical simulations of the viscous flow around common and heeled one stepped planing hulls and the computed results of the two hull forms were compared to examine the effect of the heel judge et al 2020 presented comparisons of experimental and simulation results for a deep vee high speed planing hulls in calm water and head waves and the cfd capability was assessed matveev and morabito 2020 studied the hydrodynamic characteristics of planing hulls with a negative deadrise angle and it was found that the negative deadrise hulls possessed higher lift capabilities nevertheless the prediction accuracy of the predominant approach composed of the rans equations the vof free surface capturing method and dynamic mesh techniques was not satisfactory at the full range of froude numbers fig 1 depicts the relative errors of the computed resistance dynamic trim sinkage and the wetted surface area at the volume froude number beyond unity in the literature using the aforementioned numerical methods after year 2015 the predictions of resistance exhibited the highest accuracy the values of which had a less than 15 relative error however there was still room for improvement the predictions of the running attitude were not as accurate as that of the resistance where both the error magnitudes of the trim and sinkage in a large proportion of the studies were beyond 15 although experimental uncertainties may result in the deviation of the computed results from the experiment results to some extent such an accuracy of the prediction is still not acceptable additionally the accuracy of the computed quantities should have no significant differences as the hydrodynamic performances of the planing hulls were significantly correlated with each other while unreasonable dispersions of the accuracy of the hydrodynamic characteristics existed the exhibited accuracy manifested the numerical issues of the existing numerical methods in predicting the hydrodynamic performance of the planing hulls and one of them was the nv which was discussed in part 1 of this series the nv severely affected the computed volume fraction of the wetted surface and spray and wave making phenomena leading to an erroneous wall shear stress distribution and pressure fields thus influencing the accuracies of the computed drag trim and sinkage values as for the wetted surface area wsa studies offering numerically predicted results and relative errors were very limited the lack of the wsa data might be a consequence of the fact that the conventional numerical methods suffered from the nv and the wetted surface was difficult to capture and quantify the average relative errors in most of the research papers evaluated were beyond 15 as a result numerical research using the vof method rarely focused on the characteristics of the wetted surface however it is crucial for the resistance component analysis and extrapolation of results from model to full scale the difference in the resistance components between a high speed planing hull and a common displacement ship can be found in the spray resistance which can be divided into the friction and pressure spray resistance the friction spray resistance is induced by the whisker spray which results in an additional wetted area the spray area sa the area is covered by the spray rather than solid water hence the flow field of this area is very complex the shape thickness velocity distribution and the flow condition of this area are still disputed and no formula has a wide applicability to calculate the friction resistance of the sa numerical research on the characteristics of the sa is very limited as the capture of the area is prone to the nv related research de luca et al 2016 jiang et al 2017 ponzini et al 2020 mainly focused on predicting the area of the sa and the prediction accuracy was not satisfactory theoretical analysis and semi empirical formulae were the main research methods savisky 1964 studied the hydrodynamic characteristics of prismatic planing surfaces and proposed the empirical planing equations known as the savitsky method which describes the lift drag wetted area center of pressure and dynamic stability as functions of the velocity some geometric relations of the sa were given in the research but the additional component of the viscous drag in the sa was not quantified hadler 1966 presented an improved method on the basis of the savitsky method taking the effect of the wetted area caused by spray on the friction resistance into account blount and fox 1976 introduced an engineering factor based on model tests and full scale trials to improve the performance of the savitsky method in engineering applications latorre 1983 discussed the flow state of the sa the spray thickness was assumed to be constant and he discovered that to a certain extent a laminar flow existed on the planing model bottom savitsky et al 2007 developed a comprehensive method for quantifying the friction spray resistance the area of the wetted surface caused by the whisker spray was expressed as a function of the beam equilibrium trim angle and deadrise angle derived from the geometric relations the formula for the friction coefficient the characteristic velocity and length of the sa were also given and the direction of the friction resistance was considered in the case of a warped hull formed with different deadrise angles along the longitudinal direction the effective deadrise angle was taken as that at the longitudinal position of the center of gravity from transom lcg bertorello and oliviero 2007 improved the method to calculate the wetted surface of the warped hulls in the savitsky method and the variation of the deadrise angle was considered despite these efforts the wide applicability of those theoretical or empirical methods still needs to be proved the international towing tank conference ittc 2017 pointed out that no practices are known to account for the viscous drag of the spray covered area the spray pressure resistance is associated with many complicated unsteady flow phenomena and a large number of studies tried to quantify the spray pressure resistance oliviero 2010 savitsky and morabito 2011 ghadimi et al 2014 dashtimanesh et al 2015 in engineering practice a relatively reasonable method to obtain the full scale spray pressure resistance is the extrapolation from that of the model scale based on the froude number similarity criterion while the spray friction resistance still has no practical methods to quantify it summarily the numerical methods for the hydrodynamic characteristic prediction of planing hulls still needs to be improved to achieve a higher accuracy and further research on the flow field of the sa is necessary the present paper attempts to validate the implementation and theoretical description of the improved vof method with anti ventilation techniques presented in part 1 of this series through predicting the hydrodynamic characteristics of an experimentally studied planing hull the results of the conventional numerical methods for hydrodynamics of planing hulls are given for comparison the wetted surface and spray phenomenon are visualized to demonstrate the advantage of the method in capturing them due to the elimination of the numerical ventilation the sa is numerically investigated and the spray thickness velocity distribution and the flow condition of this area are analyzed to provide a reference for the spray friction resistance calculation additionally the formula to calculate the area of the sa developed by savitsky et al 2007 is evaluated and an example of the spray friction resistance calculation based on the experiment of the simulated model is examined the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides the details of the referenced model tests the numerical methods and computation process are presented in section 3 results and discussion are given in section 4

prerequisites for the validation of the numerical results much effort has been invested in model tests to understand the hydrodynamic characteristics of the planing hull form series including series 50 davidson and saurez 1948 series 62 clement and blount 1963 keuning and gerritsma 1982 and series 65 holling and hubble 1974 in the last two decades with the advancement of test techniques more high quality results have been published katayama et al 2002 experimentally investigated the scale effect on the wetted surface area and friction and pressure resistance using a small model metcalf et al 2005 performed resistance experiments on three models varying in length to beam ratios and one model with a transom deadrise angle variation taunton et al 2010 experimentally studied the performance of a new series of high speed hard chine planing hulls offering the resistance trim angle and sinkage with an uncertainty analysis of the experimental data kim et al 2013 designed three planing hulls with the same principal dimension and conducted model tests of them to examine the effect of the bows forebody and length to beam ratios on resistance and seakeeping performances de luca and pensa 2017 evaluated the calm water performance of a hard chine hull series in the planing and transition modes and the effect of various ship parameters was investigated najafi et al 2019 2020 2021 conducted experimental tests to evaluate the hydrodynamic characteristics and the bottom wetted surfaces of one and two stepped planing hulls the hydrodynamic performances were measured at different geometrical parameters of the step and hull velocities the chosen experimental data for the validation of the improved vof method were published by begovic and bertorello 2012 the towing tests were conducted in the tank of the university of naples federico ii and four simple hull forms were tested including a monohedral hull and three warped models the monohedral hull with a constant deadrise angle 17 was denoted mono and other warped hull forms with deadrise angle varying linearly along the longitudinal direction were denoted w i i 1 2 or 3 the deadrise angle of all the hull forms at 0 25 l was 16 7 for simplicity only the mono was included in this research the principal characteristics are reported in table 1 and the body plan of the mono hull is shown in fig 2 the experimental results of the resistance trim angle sinkage and wetted surface area of the hull forms are presented in standard non dimensional form the experimental uncertainties are also shown a highlight of the tests was the measurement of the wetted surface area where a distinction was made between the sa and pa the tested models featured a transparent bottom so an accurate determination of the spray wetted surface can be achieved by the above water photography and further graphical analysis of the visual recordings shown in fig 3 the test data of the area covered by the whisker spray were significant for validating the effectiveness of the anti ventilation techniques the friction resistance of the sa was also quantified through the 1978 ittc frictional resistance formula offering a valuable reference 3 numerical methods 3 1 physics simulation models the unsteady rans equations which were discretized by the finite volume method fvm were employed to simulate the flow field around the high speed planing hull mono the incompressible reynolds averaged mass and momentum conservation equations are as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t ρ x j u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j ρ u i u j ρ f i i j 1 2 3 where u i and p give the time averaged velocity in the i direction and the time averaged working pressure respectively and ρ u i u j is the reynolds stress term leading to a mathematical closure issue to obtain the closed equations the sst k ω turbulence menter 1994 model was applied to achieve closure for the discretization schemes of the reynolds averaged momentum equation euler implicit schemes and the second order upwind scheme were adopted for the temporal and spatial schemes respectively the vof interface capturing method hirt and nichols 1981 was used to model the multi phase flow around the planing hulls where the volume fraction of a control volume v can be expressed by 3 t v α i d t r a n s i e n t t e r m s α i v d s c o n v e c t i o n t e r m 0 where α i is the volume fraction of phase i v is the velocity vector and s is the surface of control volume eq 3 consists of a transient term and a convection term indicating that the decrease of the volume fraction across the boundaries was due to the convective fluxes which were approximated by the high resolution interface capturing hric scheme in this study to suppress numerical ventilation upwind pseudo diffusive fluxes were introduced to the pa by an artificial diffusion term details in part 1 of this series therefore eq 3 for the pa was transformed into 4 t v α i d v t r a n s i e n t t e r m s α i v d s c o n v e c t i o n t e r m s u p γ α i d s a r t i f i c i a l d i f f u s i o n t e r m 0 where s up is the upwind cell faces and г is a diffusion coefficient the ship motions considered were the trim and sinkage the governing equations of which are shown in eq 5 and eq 6 and the details of the equations are offered in part 1 5 m d v d t c t f p f a f f τ f a f m g 6 m d ω d t ω m ω f r f p f a f f r f τ f a f f r f m f g 3 2 computational domain and mesh the prismatic computational domain was composed of a stationary region named the background region and a region bounded with the hull the overset region the coordinate system size and boundary conditions of the computational domain are shown in fig 4 to reduce the computational cost only half of the hull was included in the domain based on its symmetry and a symmetry boundary condition was set at the xz plane of the global coordinate system where the shear stress normal velocity and normal gradient were zero the x z axes of the ship based and global coordinate systems were in the same plane and the origin of the ship based coordinate system was the mass center of the ship the type of the inflow and outflow boundary were the velocity inlet and pressure outlet respectively the size of the domain was determined by the ittc recommendations ittc 2014 and the boundaries were placed sufficiently far from the hull to avoid the undesired influences additionally several wave damping regions were also set to suppress the wave reflection as for the overset region no recommendation was made in the literature about its size in this study the region enclosing the hull had a size of 1 5l oa which assured a smooth transition between the near wall cells of the hull and the cells at the boundaries of the overset region the number of interpolation elements was also kept in a reasonable bound the meshes in the overset region translated and rotated with the ship s motions so the mesh deformation which may introduce numerical errors can be completely avoided the linear interpolation method was used to approximate the surface flux between different regions where a shape function was deployed to dictate the blend of variable values at donor cells since the interpolation is reflected directly in the matrix the meshes in the overset and background regions were implicitly coupled in addition meshes in the background region overlapping the overset region were inactive without any equations needing to be solved the computational cost of the overset method is therefore similar to that of a common mesh method of the same resolution the meshes of the computation domain are given in fig 5 all the meshes were trimmed cell meshes which allows for anisotropic mesh refinement to ensure sufficient grid resolutions for unsteady flow features local mesh refinements were conducted in the near hull areas and kelvin wake region as shown in fig 5 to capture the free surface and avoid too much computational cost the meshes of the free surface areas were refined in the normal direction see fig 5 volumetric mesh controls were adopted to assure the same mesh size between the interpolation elements of different regions to cause fewer interpolation errors fig 6 shows the mesh of the overset region and the same mesh size of the interface red lines in fig 6 between the two regions can be observed the free surface near the stern was further refined to capture the spray phenomenon the wall treatment method was the wall function which was used to predict the flow and turbulence parameters across the wall boundary layer where the near wall cells within the log layer had a non dimensional wall distance y beyond 30 the employment of the wall function is a fairly common practice to save the number of cells in engineering applications and we adopted this method to prove the applicability of the improved vof method for engineering all the simulations were conducted using the star ccm with java based secondary development technique 3 3 computation settings the prediction procedure for the hydrodynamic assessment of planing hulls developed in part 1 consists of three main sections preliminary calculation reinitialization and final calculation the details are in part 1 the preliminary calculation was designed to speed up the convergence of the ship motions hence a large time step and the conventional vof method with the first order upwind fou vof discretization scheme were used the robustness and stability were achieved through the fully implicit euler method and the fou scheme the time step in this section was determined by the upper limit of the ittc recommended time step for the implicit ship s cfd solved with the two equation turbulence ittc 2014 which is defined as 0 01l oa v leading to a courant number evidently larger than unity the reinitialization was used to eliminate the nv caused by numerical diffusion introduced by the fou scheme in the final calculation the improved vof method and a small time step were adopted to obtain the final converged solution the running attitude obtained through the preliminary calculation which was close to the final converged position acted as the initial position of the ship for which the convergence of the ship motions could be speeded up the time step was selected to keep the local courant number below 0 5 which can satisfy the interface shaping requirement of the hric scheme böhm and graf 2014 and obtain sufficient time resolution for unsteady flow phenomena the time dependent resultant force in the z direction and moment about the y axis in the ship based coordinate system see fig 4 before and after the reinitialization process were plotted in fig 7 when the force and the moment were equal to zero an equilibrium running attitude of the hull was obtained it can be seen that the curves in the preliminary calculation were smoother than that in the final calculation as the time step in the former process was bigger and the time resolution was not sufficient to resolve the time variation of the unsteady forces the reinitialization generated an oscillation but it basically had no influence on convergence of the final calculation the time variation of the volume fraction of water on the hull bottom in the preliminary calculation was shown in fig 8 a the interface between water and air was seriously smeared due to numerical diffusion introduced by the fou scheme and the bottom was covered with the unphysical mixture of the two immiscible phases see fig 8 b to give a more appropriate initial condition the volume fraction field behind the identified pressure center see fig 8 b was reinitialized accordingly the dynamic viscosity density and other related quantities were also updated fig 8 c shows the obtained volume fraction of water through the reinitialization as for the final calculation stage shown in fig 8 d the nv was completely avoided in the pa due to the anti ventilation techniques and satisfied capture of the sa was also quickly achieved as the volume fraction of this area can be regarded as transported from the pa details in part 1 the time variation of running attitudes and resistance were plotted in fig 9 as depicted in fig 9 a the differences between the running attitudes obtained through the preliminary calculation and the final converged running attitudes were not significant which indicated that the preliminary calculation could provide appropriate initial running attitudes for the final calculation and speed up the convergence of ship motions in the process fig 9 b illustrates the time variation of total resistance one can see that the computed resistance in the final calculation showed a demonstrable improvement of accuracy over preliminary calculation which caused by the elimination of the nv in the reinitialization process 4 results and discussion the validation of the computed results was conducted and the flow field of the sa was numerically investigated 4 1 mesh convergence study to ensure that the present numerical methods are not sensitive to the mesh size a mesh convergence study was carried out two volume froude numbers 0 972 and 3 896 were selected to cover the simulations of the displacement mode and planing mode the hydrodynamic characteristics of which are significantly different three sets of mesh with the same topologies were generated for the study and the mesh refinement ratio was 2 determined based on the ittc 2008 details of the meshes are listed in table 2 and all the y values ranged from 30 to 100 the results of the study are shown in table 3 where r is the mesh convergence ratio to determine the convergence condition defined as 7 r ε 21 ε 32 where ε 21 and ε 32 are the changes between the medium fine and coarse medium meshes respectively the results showed that the solution procedure converged monotonically since all the values of r were between 0 and 1 additionally a large proportion of r value is less than 0 3 which indicated that the results of the fine mesh showed no pronounced change compared with that of the medium mesh therefore the mesh independence of the numerical approach is proved taking the accuracy and computational cost into account mesh 2 was selected for the following computations 4 2 solution validation the systematic procedure with the improved vof method for the hydrodynamic assessment of planing hulls was developed in part 1 of this series to evaluate the applicability of the systematic procedure the comparison of the computed and experimental results begovic and bertorello 2012 were given for the entire froude range the results of the conventional numerical methods composed of the rans method conventional vof method and overset mesh method were also given to estimate the accuracy improvement of the developed systematic procedure the difference between the present numerical methods in the final calculation and the conventional methods was only the vof method the hydrodynamic quantities were the total resistance trim angle sinkage and wetted surface area wsa which are given in standard non dimensional form the capture of the wetted surface was most immediately benefited by the anti ventilation techniques the computed and experimental non dimensional wsa with relative errors at different fr values were plotted in fig 10 one can see that the computed results were generally larger than the experimental values which might be caused by the artificial diffusion term in the vof equation for the pa the term was designed to eliminate unphysical air with diffusive fluxes while the air phase area might be over reduced nevertheless the computed results exhibited satisfactory accuracy the error magnitudes were less than 5 showing a considerable improvement compared with that of existing research see section 1 the wsa data obtained through the conventional methods were not provided since the wetted surface was smudged by the nv and the computed volume fraction values had no physical significance fig 11 shows the computed volume fraction of water on the hull surfaces of the conventional and present numerical methods the wetted surface capture of the conventional method demonstrated the impact of the nv the volume fraction of water was evidently under estimated especially for the sa for the results of the present method there was no unphysical phase in the pa which indicated that the nv was completely avoided by the artificial diffusion term introduced to the pa the computed volume fraction in sa suffered slightly from the nv in some cases since no special means used in the area to suppress the unphysical air transport but the predicted hydrodynamic quantities were basically unaffected the results of the wetted surface area with the error magnitude larger than 5 were only at volume froude numbers 1 582 and 1 921 where the hulls ran in the displacement mode the location of the pressure center was expressed by the static pressure isolines where the lines are densest due to the large pressure gradient it can be seen that the pressure centers in the low speed range were relatively mellow as they were in the forward of the hull with curvature see fig 2 the curvature there might affect the capture of the pressure center leading to the over predicted wetted surface the tips of the pressure centers gradually sharpened with the increase of fr value because the pressure center moved aft with the increase of speed and the rear of the hull had no curvature see fig 2 when the volume fraction of the water of the wetted surface was well predicted the capture of the spray phenomenon also showed improvement fig 12 shows the flow around the high speed planing hull in the model test the main spray phenomenon can be clearly seen the water phase of which come from the bottom of the hull and fall to the free surface under the action of gravity casuing a considerably irregular free surface near the hull the irregular free surface capture was always problematic as the details of unsteady spray and wave making phenomena are difficult to resolve using the conventional vof method mousaviraad et al 2015 and the nv tends to exacerbate the problem fig 13 shows the computed volume fraction of the water of the main spray in a transverse section located at 0 4 m forward from the stern using the conventional and present numerical methods for the results of the conventional methods showed in fig 13 a the volume fraction of water beyond the free surface was less than unity and distributed unphysically as the volume fraction of water transported into the main spray was under predicted consequently a lower computed pressure resistance will be caused including the spray pressure resistance and wave making resistance fig 13 b illustrates the results of the present numerical methods the volume fraction values were reasonable and the distribution of the irregular free surfaces was better predicted the process of the water phase detachment from the main spray and fall to the free surface was well captured and the interaction of the water phase with the free surface deserves further research however the volume fraction values still revealed some remaining unphysical phase further mesh refinement can improve the resolution but that is too computationally expensive and the mesh convergence study indicates that the accuracy of computed pressure resistance cannot be significantly promoted the computed and experimental total resistance with comparison errors are shown in fig 14 all the error magnitudes of the present methods were less than 5 showing a high prediction accuracy the errors of the conventional methods were basically identical with those of the present methods in the low speed range since there was no unphysical air entry to the hull bottom in the displacement mode and the nv can be avoided the errors of the conventional methods in the high speed range were not satisfactory due to the nv which indicated an evident accuracy improvement of the present methods the results of the present methods in the transition and planing modes showed under predicted resistance which were mainly caused by the calculation of the spray pressure resistance and wave making resistance the improved vof method could suppress the effect of the nv on the calculation while the defects of the conventional vof method in quantifying the pressure resistance caused by unsteady spray and wave making phenomena cannot be overcome thoroughly as a result the resistance was under estimated in the high speed range where the pressure resistance accounted for a considerable proportion of the total resistance the comparison of the trim results with relative errors is shown in fig 15 the maximum norm of the relative errors of the present methods was 5 5 while the value of the conventional methods was 14 a high prediction accuracy and accuracy improvement were also achieved by the present methods in the transition and planing modes both the computed values of the present and conventional methods were lower than the experimental results due to the under predicted hydrodynamic lift the under predicted wave making and spray pressure resistance mentioned earlier indicated the under predicted hydrodynamic lift since they are both components of the pressure under the hull this resulted in a smaller trim angle in the high speed range the higher accuracy of the present methods resuted from the suppression of the nv which allows a more physcial pressure field around the hull fig 16 shows the sinkage comparison results and relative errors the computed values were smaller in the high speed range which was consistent with the above analysis the errors of the present methods are also acceptable and the evident accuracy improvement is clear when compared with that of the conventional methods 4 3 hydrodynamic analysis of the spray area the sa is a characteristic part of the wetted surface of a high speed planing hull created by the whisker spray where the flow phenomena is very complex as the capture of the area is prone to the nv the flow field of the area has been rarely studied numerically an advantage of the improved vof method over the conventional vof method is the capture of the wetted surface hence research on the sa was conducted the computed and experimental areas of the sa with relative errors are shown in fig 17 and the areas obtained through the formula proposed by savitsky et al 2007 are also presented the identification criterion for the sa in this research is the water phase which is forward of the pressure center the magnitude of the errors was less than 5 and the computed results were larger which was consistent with that of the total wetted surface area the smaller computed values were mainly caused by the difference in the identification method for the sa fig 18 shows the capture of the sa in this research the identified sa of the numerical results did not extend to the keel while the extension to midship was assumed when the area was measured in the experiment see fig 3 nevertheless the sa was captured with a high accuracy and research based on the capture can be conducted as for the results of the formula savitsky et al 2007 they were seriously over predicted which indicated that the area was difficult to quantify through the geometric relations the hydrodynamic characteristic of interest of the sa was the friction resistance which needs further research to extrapolate the resistance from model scale to full scale theoretically the viscous sublayer of the sa should be resolved using the near wall resolving method to better quantify the friction resistance and study the flow state however the approach is not applicable for this sort of multiphase flow with the dynamic mesh as the volume fraction of the hull surface varies significantly with the ship s running attitude the variation of the volume fraction was seriously limited by the no slip velocity of the viscous sublayer consequently the wall function method was adopted although the viscosity affected near wall region was skipped with the algebraic wall function the high accuracy total resistance prediction manifested the feasibility of the wall function method to calculate the friction resistance and qualitatively analyze the flow state fig 19 shows the volume fraction of water and streamlines under the hull the starting point of the streamlines of the sa was located at the pressure center and the flow of the sa can be regarded as the reflection of the freestreams on the pressure center which was indicative of the covering of the whisker spray on the area as a consequence the flow state of the sa is different from that of common boundary layers the thickness of the boundary layer was determined by not only the velocity distribution but also the thickness of the covering whisker spray fig 20 shows the volume fraction of water and velocity distribution of a section of the sa parallel to the spray velocity the position of the section is marked with yellow lines in fig 19 it can be seen that the thickness of the water phase shrank immediately after crossing the pressure center and was mainly concentrated on the first three near wall layers hence the boundary layer was limited in the cells the velocity of the outmost cells was evidently less than the velocity of the freestream leading to a low reynolds number the flow field of a section of the sa normal to the spray velocity is shown in fig 21 and the position of the section is marked with a red line in fig 19 the volume fraction of water shown fig 21 a indicates that the thickness was reduced with the decrease of the distance to the chine and the velocity in fig 21 b also shows a decreasing trend in most empirical and semi empirical formulae the thickness of the spray is always assumed to be constant which might be not appropriate fig 22 shows the magnitude of the wall s shear stress the isolines in the sa were much denser than that of the pa and mainly parallel to the spray velocity manifesting the large gradient normal to the velocity which is caused by the decrease of velocity and spray thickness along the direction the magnitude along the spray velocity in the region is basically unchanged since the velocity and spray thickness were almost invariant in the direction begovic and bertorello 2012 provided the friction force the longitudinal components of which is the spray friction resistance of the sa of the mono hull where the mean velocity was assumed to be the velocity of the freestream the calculated reynolds numbers were in a range from 1 3 106 up to 8 106 and the ittc friction resistance formula was applied the approach of taking the boundary layer of the sa as a common boundary layer might be not feasible the comparison of the ittc calculated friction force along the spray velocity and the numerically computed friction force of this research are given in fig 23 which showed a considerable deviation some friction resistance formulae for laminar or transition flow may be more applicable in the absence of an applicable method to quantify the resistance disregarding the friction resistance of the sa might be a practical method fig 24 shows the proportion of the friction resistance in the total resistance the percent accounted for by the component was less than 5 5 conclusions this paper series introduced an improved vof method with anti ventilation techniques and the implementation of the method for hydrodynamic assessment of planing hulls the theoretical description was given in part 1 in the present paper the method was validated through predicting the hydrodynamic characteristics of an experimentally studied planing hull and compared with the results of conventional numerical methods the validation and comparison indicated that considerable accuracy improvement was achieved by the improved vof method especially in the high speed range the captured wetted surface and spray phenomenon manifested the significant elimination effect on the nv the method was also applied to investigate the shape and flow field of the sa the cfd and efd results showed that the formula to calculate the area of the sa proposed by savitsky et al 2007 might be not feasible because the area was difficult to quantify through intuitive geometric relations the computed volume fraction of water and velocity of the sa showed that the boundary layer thickness might be limited by the spray thickness the velocity of the outmost boundary layer was therefore smaller than that of the freestream leading to a low reynolds number there additionally the spray thickness and velocity varied obviously with the position resulting in the relatively large gradient of the wall shear stress magnitude there the friction resistance of the sa calculated by begovic and bertorello 2012 showed a large deviation from the cfd results since the boundary layer of the sa was assumed to be a common turbulent boundary layer in the calculation in the absence of an applicable method disregarding the resistance might be a practical method for resistance extrapolation as the friction resistance accounted for a limited

20351,the improved volume of fluid vof method proposed in part 1 to eliminate the numerical ventilation nv was applied to predict the hydrodynamic characteristics of an experimentally studied planing hull the simulated ship motions were the trim and sinkage the overset mesh method was employed to avoid undesirable mesh deformation the results of the improved and conventional vof methods were reported and compared with the experimental data the captured wetted surface and spray phenomenon which were prone to the nv were visualized to manifest the advantage of the improved method in capturing them the flow field of the spray area sa which has been rarely numerically studied due to the nv was also investigated to provide a reference for quantifying the spray friction resistance and evaluate some related formulae the comparison demonstrated a considerable accuracy improvement of the improved vof method the visualization also showed a significant elimination effect on the nv the study on the sa indicated that the spray thickness might limit the boundary layer thickness leading to a low reynolds number furthermore the spray thickness and the velocity of the area were not constant which induced the relatively large gradient of the wall shear stress magnitude keywords planing hull hydrodynamic characteristics numerical ventilation volume of fluid diffusion term 1 introduction the numerical prediction of the hydrodynamic characteristics of high speed planing hulls suffers from numerical ventilation nv the unphysical entrainment of air it is of vital importance to eliminate the nv and improve the prediction accuracy in part 1 of this series anti ventilation techniques were developed to achieve the elimination considerable robustness and convergency were also brought about by the techniques hence a larger time step can be tolerated to implement the anti ventilation techniques as well as achieve a more accurate and faster prediction a novel systematic procedure was developed part 1 provides a detailed discussion the systematic procedure was based on the widely utilized reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method with dynamic mesh technique and volume of fluid vof free surface capturing method lotfi et al 2015 presented a three dimensional computational fluid dynamics cfd procedure for a planing hull with a transverse step and the characteristics of the hull were examined jiang et al 2017 developed a viscous cfd simulation procedure for a planing trimaran and the tunnel of the trimaran was investigated ponzini et al 2020 presented a web based tool to perform a numerical simulation of planing hulls which was specially designed to perform automatic cfd simulations of planing hulls the mesh technique plays an important role in the numerical simulation for planing hulls because the large ship motions caused by the hydrodynamic lift tend to result in undesirable mesh deformation which may introduce numerical errors or even lead to computational divergence jahanbakhsh et al 2009 and panahi et al 2009 adopted the boundary fitted body attached mesh to predict hydrodynamic performances of planing hulls and special care was given to avoid the numerical errors and invalid grids caused by the mesh deformation another common dynamic mesh strategy for the numerical prediction is the overset mesh method orihara and miyata 2003 castiglione et al 2011 mousaviraad et al 2015 sukas et al 2017 de marco et al 2017 in which the entire computational domain is enclosed by a background region and a small overset region containing the hull is set up within the domain the overset region is bounded to the hull hence the mesh deformation resulting from the ship s motion can be completely avoided this method provides more accurate motion results and allows for the detection of the nonlinear effect the vof interface capturing method has been widely applied for the multiphase flow model to predict the distribution and movement of the free surface of the flow field around a high speed planing hull the discretization schemes for the transport equation of the volume fraction are critical to achieve an accurate free surface capture the compressive interface capturing scheme for arbitrary meshes cicsam ubbink 1997 and the high resolution interface capturing hric muzaferija and peri 1998 are two commonly used schemes seif et al 2009 calculated the resistance of a planing trimaran using the vof method discretized by the cicam panahi et al 2009 predicted the 3d nonlinear motions of high speed vessels through the vof method with the cicam discretization scheme in recent years the hric scheme has become the more popular discretization scheme for the vof equation because of its reasonable efficiency and accuracy yousefi et al 2014 used the vof method with the hric scheme to predict the hydrodynamic performance of planing hulls with and without the tunnel drag reduction strategy and the results showed that the strategy achieved a 14 reduction in total drag khazaee et al 2019 investigated the hydrodynamic aspects of a planing hull the results were compared against savitsky s method and experimental results the comparison indicated that the rans method with the hric scheme was more accurate and reliable dashtimanesh et al 2020 performed numerical simulations of the viscous flow around common and heeled one stepped planing hulls and the computed results of the two hull forms were compared to examine the effect of the heel judge et al 2020 presented comparisons of experimental and simulation results for a deep vee high speed planing hulls in calm water and head waves and the cfd capability was assessed matveev and morabito 2020 studied the hydrodynamic characteristics of planing hulls with a negative deadrise angle and it was found that the negative deadrise hulls possessed higher lift capabilities nevertheless the prediction accuracy of the predominant approach composed of the rans equations the vof free surface capturing method and dynamic mesh techniques was not satisfactory at the full range of froude numbers fig 1 depicts the relative errors of the computed resistance dynamic trim sinkage and the wetted surface area at the volume froude number beyond unity in the literature using the aforementioned numerical methods after year 2015 the predictions of resistance exhibited the highest accuracy the values of which had a less than 15 relative error however there was still room for improvement the predictions of the running attitude were not as accurate as that of the resistance where both the error magnitudes of the trim and sinkage in a large proportion of the studies were beyond 15 although experimental uncertainties may result in the deviation of the computed results from the experiment results to some extent such an accuracy of the prediction is still not acceptable additionally the accuracy of the computed quantities should have no significant differences as the hydrodynamic performances of the planing hulls were significantly correlated with each other while unreasonable dispersions of the accuracy of the hydrodynamic characteristics existed the exhibited accuracy manifested the numerical issues of the existing numerical methods in predicting the hydrodynamic performance of the planing hulls and one of them was the nv which was discussed in part 1 of this series the nv severely affected the computed volume fraction of the wetted surface and spray and wave making phenomena leading to an erroneous wall shear stress distribution and pressure fields thus influencing the accuracies of the computed drag trim and sinkage values as for the wetted surface area wsa studies offering numerically predicted results and relative errors were very limited the lack of the wsa data might be a consequence of the fact that the conventional numerical methods suffered from the nv and the wetted surface was difficult to capture and quantify the average relative errors in most of the research papers evaluated were beyond 15 as a result numerical research using the vof method rarely focused on the characteristics of the wetted surface however it is crucial for the resistance component analysis and extrapolation of results from model to full scale the difference in the resistance components between a high speed planing hull and a common displacement ship can be found in the spray resistance which can be divided into the friction and pressure spray resistance the friction spray resistance is induced by the whisker spray which results in an additional wetted area the spray area sa the area is covered by the spray rather than solid water hence the flow field of this area is very complex the shape thickness velocity distribution and the flow condition of this area are still disputed and no formula has a wide applicability to calculate the friction resistance of the sa numerical research on the characteristics of the sa is very limited as the capture of the area is prone to the nv related research de luca et al 2016 jiang et al 2017 ponzini et al 2020 mainly focused on predicting the area of the sa and the prediction accuracy was not satisfactory theoretical analysis and semi empirical formulae were the main research methods savisky 1964 studied the hydrodynamic characteristics of prismatic planing surfaces and proposed the empirical planing equations known as the savitsky method which describes the lift drag wetted area center of pressure and dynamic stability as functions of the velocity some geometric relations of the sa were given in the research but the additional component of the viscous drag in the sa was not quantified hadler 1966 presented an improved method on the basis of the savitsky method taking the effect of the wetted area caused by spray on the friction resistance into account blount and fox 1976 introduced an engineering factor based on model tests and full scale trials to improve the performance of the savitsky method in engineering applications latorre 1983 discussed the flow state of the sa the spray thickness was assumed to be constant and he discovered that to a certain extent a laminar flow existed on the planing model bottom savitsky et al 2007 developed a comprehensive method for quantifying the friction spray resistance the area of the wetted surface caused by the whisker spray was expressed as a function of the beam equilibrium trim angle and deadrise angle derived from the geometric relations the formula for the friction coefficient the characteristic velocity and length of the sa were also given and the direction of the friction resistance was considered in the case of a warped hull formed with different deadrise angles along the longitudinal direction the effective deadrise angle was taken as that at the longitudinal position of the center of gravity from transom lcg bertorello and oliviero 2007 improved the method to calculate the wetted surface of the warped hulls in the savitsky method and the variation of the deadrise angle was considered despite these efforts the wide applicability of those theoretical or empirical methods still needs to be proved the international towing tank conference ittc 2017 pointed out that no practices are known to account for the viscous drag of the spray covered area the spray pressure resistance is associated with many complicated unsteady flow phenomena and a large number of studies tried to quantify the spray pressure resistance oliviero 2010 savitsky and morabito 2011 ghadimi et al 2014 dashtimanesh et al 2015 in engineering practice a relatively reasonable method to obtain the full scale spray pressure resistance is the extrapolation from that of the model scale based on the froude number similarity criterion while the spray friction resistance still has no practical methods to quantify it summarily the numerical methods for the hydrodynamic characteristic prediction of planing hulls still needs to be improved to achieve a higher accuracy and further research on the flow field of the sa is necessary the present paper attempts to validate the implementation and theoretical description of the improved vof method with anti ventilation techniques presented in part 1 of this series through predicting the hydrodynamic characteristics of an experimentally studied planing hull the results of the conventional numerical methods for hydrodynamics of planing hulls are given for comparison the wetted surface and spray phenomenon are visualized to demonstrate the advantage of the method in capturing them due to the elimination of the numerical ventilation the sa is numerically investigated and the spray thickness velocity distribution and the flow condition of this area are analyzed to provide a reference for the spray friction resistance calculation additionally the formula to calculate the area of the sa developed by savitsky et al 2007 is evaluated and an example of the spray friction resistance calculation based on the experiment of the simulated model is examined the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides the details of the referenced model tests the numerical methods and computation process are presented in section 3 results and discussion are given in section 4

prerequisites for the validation of the numerical results much effort has been invested in model tests to understand the hydrodynamic characteristics of the planing hull form series including series 50 davidson and saurez 1948 series 62 clement and blount 1963 keuning and gerritsma 1982 and series 65 holling and hubble 1974 in the last two decades with the advancement of test techniques more high quality results have been published katayama et al 2002 experimentally investigated the scale effect on the wetted surface area and friction and pressure resistance using a small model metcalf et al 2005 performed resistance experiments on three models varying in length to beam ratios and one model with a transom deadrise angle variation taunton et al 2010 experimentally studied the performance of a new series of high speed hard chine planing hulls offering the resistance trim angle and sinkage with an uncertainty analysis of the experimental data kim et al 2013 designed three planing hulls with the same principal dimension and conducted model tests of them to examine the effect of the bows forebody and length to beam ratios on resistance and seakeeping performances de luca and pensa 2017 evaluated the calm water performance of a hard chine hull series in the planing and transition modes and the effect of various ship parameters was investigated najafi et al 2019 2020 2021 conducted experimental tests to evaluate the hydrodynamic characteristics and the bottom wetted surfaces of one and two stepped planing hulls the hydrodynamic performances were measured at different geometrical parameters of the step and hull velocities the chosen experimental data for the validation of the improved vof method were published by begovic and bertorello 2012 the towing tests were conducted in the tank of the university of naples federico ii and four simple hull forms were tested including a monohedral hull and three warped models the monohedral hull with a constant deadrise angle 17 was denoted mono and other warped hull forms with deadrise angle varying linearly along the longitudinal direction were denoted w i i 1 2 or 3 the deadrise angle of all the hull forms at 0 25 l was 16 7 for simplicity only the mono was included in this research the principal characteristics are reported in table 1 and the body plan of the mono hull is shown in fig 2 the experimental results of the resistance trim angle sinkage and wetted surface area of the hull forms are presented in standard non dimensional form the experimental uncertainties are also shown a highlight of the tests was the measurement of the wetted surface area where a distinction was made between the sa and pa the tested models featured a transparent bottom so an accurate determination of the spray wetted surface can be achieved by the above water photography and further graphical analysis of the visual recordings shown in fig 3 the test data of the area covered by the whisker spray were significant for validating the effectiveness of the anti ventilation techniques the friction resistance of the sa was also quantified through the 1978 ittc frictional resistance formula offering a valuable reference 3 numerical methods 3 1 physics simulation models the unsteady rans equations which were discretized by the finite volume method fvm were employed to simulate the flow field around the high speed planing hull mono the incompressible reynolds averaged mass and momentum conservation equations are as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t ρ x j u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j ρ u i u j ρ f i i j 1 2 3 where u i and p give the time averaged velocity in the i direction and the time averaged working pressure respectively and ρ u i u j is the reynolds stress term leading to a mathematical closure issue to obtain the closed equations the sst k ω turbulence menter 1994 model was applied to achieve closure for the discretization schemes of the reynolds averaged momentum equation euler implicit schemes and the second order upwind scheme were adopted for the temporal and spatial schemes respectively the vof interface capturing method hirt and nichols 1981 was used to model the multi phase flow around the planing hulls where the volume fraction of a control volume v can be expressed by 3 t v α i d t r a n s i e n t t e r m s α i v d s c o n v e c t i o n t e r m 0 where α i is the volume fraction of phase i v is the velocity vector and s is the surface of control volume eq 3 consists of a transient term and a convection term indicating that the decrease of the volume fraction across the boundaries was due to the convective fluxes which were approximated by the high resolution interface capturing hric scheme in this study to suppress numerical ventilation upwind pseudo diffusive fluxes were introduced to the pa by an artificial diffusion term details in part 1 of this series therefore eq 3 for the pa was transformed into 4 t v α i d v t r a n s i e n t t e r m s α i v d s c o n v e c t i o n t e r m s u p γ α i d s a r t i f i c i a l d i f f u s i o n t e r m 0 where s up is the upwind cell faces and г is a diffusion coefficient the ship motions considered were the trim and sinkage the governing equations of which are shown in eq 5 and eq 6 and the details of the equations are offered in part 1 5 m d v d t c t f p f a f f τ f a f m g 6 m d ω d t ω m ω f r f p f a f f r f τ f a f f r f m f g 3 2 computational domain and mesh the prismatic computational domain was composed of a stationary region named the background region and a region bounded with the hull the overset region the coordinate system size and boundary conditions of the computational domain are shown in fig 4 to reduce the computational cost only half of the hull was included in the domain based on its symmetry and a symmetry boundary condition was set at the xz plane of the global coordinate system where the shear stress normal velocity and normal gradient were zero the x z axes of the ship based and global coordinate systems were in the same plane and the origin of the ship based coordinate system was the mass center of the ship the type of the inflow and outflow boundary were the velocity inlet and pressure outlet respectively the size of the domain was determined by the ittc recommendations ittc 2014 and the boundaries were placed sufficiently far from the hull to avoid the undesired influences additionally several wave damping regions were also set to suppress the wave reflection as for the overset region no recommendation was made in the literature about its size in this study the region enclosing the hull had a size of 1 5l oa which assured a smooth transition between the near wall cells of the hull and the cells at the boundaries of the overset region the number of interpolation elements was also kept in a reasonable bound the meshes in the overset region translated and rotated with the ship s motions so the mesh deformation which may introduce numerical errors can be completely avoided the linear interpolation method was used to approximate the surface flux between different regions where a shape function was deployed to dictate the blend of variable values at donor cells since the interpolation is reflected directly in the matrix the meshes in the overset and background regions were implicitly coupled in addition meshes in the background region overlapping the overset region were inactive without any equations needing to be solved the computational cost of the overset method is therefore similar to that of a common mesh method of the same resolution the meshes of the computation domain are given in fig 5 all the meshes were trimmed cell meshes which allows for anisotropic mesh refinement to ensure sufficient grid resolutions for unsteady flow features local mesh refinements were conducted in the near hull areas and kelvin wake region as shown in fig 5 to capture the free surface and avoid too much computational cost the meshes of the free surface areas were refined in the normal direction see fig 5 volumetric mesh controls were adopted to assure the same mesh size between the interpolation elements of different regions to cause fewer interpolation errors fig 6 shows the mesh of the overset region and the same mesh size of the interface red lines in fig 6 between the two regions can be observed the free surface near the stern was further refined to capture the spray phenomenon the wall treatment method was the wall function which was used to predict the flow and turbulence parameters across the wall boundary layer where the near wall cells within the log layer had a non dimensional wall distance y beyond 30 the employment of the wall function is a fairly common practice to save the number of cells in engineering applications and we adopted this method to prove the applicability of the improved vof method for engineering all the simulations were conducted using the star ccm with java based secondary development technique 3 3 computation settings the prediction procedure for the hydrodynamic assessment of planing hulls developed in part 1 consists of three main sections preliminary calculation reinitialization and final calculation the details are in part 1 the preliminary calculation was designed to speed up the convergence of the ship motions hence a large time step and the conventional vof method with the first order upwind fou vof discretization scheme were used the robustness and stability were achieved through the fully implicit euler method and the fou scheme the time step in this section was determined by the upper limit of the ittc recommended time step for the implicit ship s cfd solved with the two equation turbulence ittc 2014 which is defined as 0 01l oa v leading to a courant number evidently larger than unity the reinitialization was used to eliminate the nv caused by numerical diffusion introduced by the fou scheme in the final calculation the improved vof method and a small time step were adopted to obtain the final converged solution the running attitude obtained through the preliminary calculation which was close to the final converged position acted as the initial position of the ship for which the convergence of the ship motions could be speeded up the time step was selected to keep the local courant number below 0 5 which can satisfy the interface shaping requirement of the hric scheme böhm and graf 2014 and obtain sufficient time resolution for unsteady flow phenomena the time dependent resultant force in the z direction and moment about the y axis in the ship based coordinate system see fig 4 before and after the reinitialization process were plotted in fig 7 when the force and the moment were equal to zero an equilibrium running attitude of the hull was obtained it can be seen that the curves in the preliminary calculation were smoother than that in the final calculation as the time step in the former process was bigger and the time resolution was not sufficient to resolve the time variation of the unsteady forces the reinitialization generated an oscillation but it basically had no influence on convergence of the final calculation the time variation of the volume fraction of water on the hull bottom in the preliminary calculation was shown in fig 8 a the interface between water and air was seriously smeared due to numerical diffusion introduced by the fou scheme and the bottom was covered with the unphysical mixture of the two immiscible phases see fig 8 b to give a more appropriate initial condition the volume fraction field behind the identified pressure center see fig 8 b was reinitialized accordingly the dynamic viscosity density and other related quantities were also updated fig 8 c shows the obtained volume fraction of water through the reinitialization as for the final calculation stage shown in fig 8 d the nv was completely avoided in the pa due to the anti ventilation techniques and satisfied capture of the sa was also quickly achieved as the volume fraction of this area can be regarded as transported from the pa details in part 1 the time variation of running attitudes and resistance were plotted in fig 9 as depicted in fig 9 a the differences between the running attitudes obtained through the preliminary calculation and the final converged running attitudes were not significant which indicated that the preliminary calculation could provide appropriate initial running attitudes for the final calculation and speed up the convergence of ship motions in the process fig 9 b illustrates the time variation of total resistance one can see that the computed resistance in the final calculation showed a demonstrable improvement of accuracy over preliminary calculation which caused by the elimination of the nv in the reinitialization process 4 results and discussion the validation of the computed results was conducted and the flow field of the sa was numerically investigated 4 1 mesh convergence study to ensure that the present numerical methods are not sensitive to the mesh size a mesh convergence study was carried out two volume froude numbers 0 972 and 3 896 were selected to cover the simulations of the displacement mode and planing mode the hydrodynamic characteristics of which are significantly different three sets of mesh with the same topologies were generated for the study and the mesh refinement ratio was 2 determined based on the ittc 2008 details of the meshes are listed in table 2 and all the y values ranged from 30 to 100 the results of the study are shown in table 3 where r is the mesh convergence ratio to determine the convergence condition defined as 7 r ε 21 ε 32 where ε 21 and ε 32 are the changes between the medium fine and coarse medium meshes respectively the results showed that the solution procedure converged monotonically since all the values of r were between 0 and 1 additionally a large proportion of r value is less than 0 3 which indicated that the results of the fine mesh showed no pronounced change compared with that of the medium mesh therefore the mesh independence of the numerical approach is proved taking the accuracy and computational cost into account mesh 2 was selected for the following computations 4 2 solution validation the systematic procedure with the improved vof method for the hydrodynamic assessment of planing hulls was developed in part 1 of this series to evaluate the applicability of the systematic procedure the comparison of the computed and experimental results begovic and bertorello 2012 were given for the entire froude range the results of the conventional numerical methods composed of the rans method conventional vof method and overset mesh method were also given to estimate the accuracy improvement of the developed systematic procedure the difference between the present numerical methods in the final calculation and the conventional methods was only the vof method the hydrodynamic quantities were the total resistance trim angle sinkage and wetted surface area wsa which are given in standard non dimensional form the capture of the wetted surface was most immediately benefited by the anti ventilation techniques the computed and experimental non dimensional wsa with relative errors at different fr values were plotted in fig 10 one can see that the computed results were generally larger than the experimental values which might be caused by the artificial diffusion term in the vof equation for the pa the term was designed to eliminate unphysical air with diffusive fluxes while the air phase area might be over reduced nevertheless the computed results exhibited satisfactory accuracy the error magnitudes were less than 5 showing a considerable improvement compared with that of existing research see section 1 the wsa data obtained through the conventional methods were not provided since the wetted surface was smudged by the nv and the computed volume fraction values had no physical significance fig 11 shows the computed volume fraction of water on the hull surfaces of the conventional and present numerical methods the wetted surface capture of the conventional method demonstrated the impact of the nv the volume fraction of water was evidently under estimated especially for the sa for the results of the present method there was no unphysical phase in the pa which indicated that the nv was completely avoided by the artificial diffusion term introduced to the pa the computed volume fraction in sa suffered slightly from the nv in some cases since no special means used in the area to suppress the unphysical air transport but the predicted hydrodynamic quantities were basically unaffected the results of the wetted surface area with the error magnitude larger than 5 were only at volume froude numbers 1 582 and 1 921 where the hulls ran in the displacement mode the location of the pressure center was expressed by the static pressure isolines where the lines are densest due to the large pressure gradient it can be seen that the pressure centers in the low speed range were relatively mellow as they were in the forward of the hull with curvature see fig 2 the curvature there might affect the capture of the pressure center leading to the over predicted wetted surface the tips of the pressure centers gradually sharpened with the increase of fr value because the pressure center moved aft with the increase of speed and the rear of the hull had no curvature see fig 2 when the volume fraction of the water of the wetted surface was well predicted the capture of the spray phenomenon also showed improvement fig 12 shows the flow around the high speed planing hull in the model test the main spray phenomenon can be clearly seen the water phase of which come from the bottom of the hull and fall to the free surface under the action of gravity casuing a considerably irregular free surface near the hull the irregular free surface capture was always problematic as the details of unsteady spray and wave making phenomena are difficult to resolve using the conventional vof method mousaviraad et al 2015 and the nv tends to exacerbate the problem fig 13 shows the computed volume fraction of the water of the main spray in a transverse section located at 0 4 m forward from the stern using the conventional and present numerical methods for the results of the conventional methods showed in fig 13 a the volume fraction of water beyond the free surface was less than unity and distributed unphysically as the volume fraction of water transported into the main spray was under predicted consequently a lower computed pressure resistance will be caused including the spray pressure resistance and wave making resistance fig 13 b illustrates the results of the present numerical methods the volume fraction values were reasonable and the distribution of the irregular free surfaces was better predicted the process of the water phase detachment from the main spray and fall to the free surface was well captured and the interaction of the water phase with the free surface deserves further research however the volume fraction values still revealed some remaining unphysical phase further mesh refinement can improve the resolution but that is too computationally expensive and the mesh convergence study indicates that the accuracy of computed pressure resistance cannot be significantly promoted the computed and experimental total resistance with comparison errors are shown in fig 14 all the error magnitudes of the present methods were less than 5 showing a high prediction accuracy the errors of the conventional methods were basically identical with those of the present methods in the low speed range since there was no unphysical air entry to the hull bottom in the displacement mode and the nv can be avoided the errors of the conventional methods in the high speed range were not satisfactory due to the nv which indicated an evident accuracy improvement of the present methods the results of the present methods in the transition and planing modes showed under predicted resistance which were mainly caused by the calculation of the spray pressure resistance and wave making resistance the improved vof method could suppress the effect of the nv on the calculation while the defects of the conventional vof method in quantifying the pressure resistance caused by unsteady spray and wave making phenomena cannot be overcome thoroughly as a result the resistance was under estimated in the high speed range where the pressure resistance accounted for a considerable proportion of the total resistance the comparison of the trim results with relative errors is shown in fig 15 the maximum norm of the relative errors of the present methods was 5 5 while the value of the conventional methods was 14 a high prediction accuracy and accuracy improvement were also achieved by the present methods in the transition and planing modes both the computed values of the present and conventional methods were lower than the experimental results due to the under predicted hydrodynamic lift the under predicted wave making and spray pressure resistance mentioned earlier indicated the under predicted hydrodynamic lift since they are both components of the pressure under the hull this resulted in a smaller trim angle in the high speed range the higher accuracy of the present methods resuted from the suppression of the nv which allows a more physcial pressure field around the hull fig 16 shows the sinkage comparison results and relative errors the computed values were smaller in the high speed range which was consistent with the above analysis the errors of the present methods are also acceptable and the evident accuracy improvement is clear when compared with that of the conventional methods 4 3 hydrodynamic analysis of the spray area the sa is a characteristic part of the wetted surface of a high speed planing hull created by the whisker spray where the flow phenomena is very complex as the capture of the area is prone to the nv the flow field of the area has been rarely studied numerically an advantage of the improved vof method over the conventional vof method is the capture of the wetted surface hence research on the sa was conducted the computed and experimental areas of the sa with relative errors are shown in fig 17 and the areas obtained through the formula proposed by savitsky et al 2007 are also presented the identification criterion for the sa in this research is the water phase which is forward of the pressure center the magnitude of the errors was less than 5 and the computed results were larger which was consistent with that of the total wetted surface area the smaller computed values were mainly caused by the difference in the identification method for the sa fig 18 shows the capture of the sa in this research the identified sa of the numerical results did not extend to the keel while the extension to midship was assumed when the area was measured in the experiment see fig 3 nevertheless the sa was captured with a high accuracy and research based on the capture can be conducted as for the results of the formula savitsky et al 2007 they were seriously over predicted which indicated that the area was difficult to quantify through the geometric relations the hydrodynamic characteristic of interest of the sa was the friction resistance which needs further research to extrapolate the resistance from model scale to full scale theoretically the viscous sublayer of the sa should be resolved using the near wall resolving method to better quantify the friction resistance and study the flow state however the approach is not applicable for this sort of multiphase flow with the dynamic mesh as the volume fraction of the hull surface varies significantly with the ship s running attitude the variation of the volume fraction was seriously limited by the no slip velocity of the viscous sublayer consequently the wall function method was adopted although the viscosity affected near wall region was skipped with the algebraic wall function the high accuracy total resistance prediction manifested the feasibility of the wall function method to calculate the friction resistance and qualitatively analyze the flow state fig 19 shows the volume fraction of water and streamlines under the hull the starting point of the streamlines of the sa was located at the pressure center and the flow of the sa can be regarded as the reflection of the freestreams on the pressure center which was indicative of the covering of the whisker spray on the area as a consequence the flow state of the sa is different from that of common boundary layers the thickness of the boundary layer was determined by not only the velocity distribution but also the thickness of the covering whisker spray fig 20 shows the volume fraction of water and velocity distribution of a section of the sa parallel to the spray velocity the position of the section is marked with yellow lines in fig 19 it can be seen that the thickness of the water phase shrank immediately after crossing the pressure center and was mainly concentrated on the first three near wall layers hence the boundary layer was limited in the cells the velocity of the outmost cells was evidently less than the velocity of the freestream leading to a low reynolds number the flow field of a section of the sa normal to the spray velocity is shown in fig 21 and the position of the section is marked with a red line in fig 19 the volume fraction of water shown fig 21 a indicates that the thickness was reduced with the decrease of the distance to the chine and the velocity in fig 21 b also shows a decreasing trend in most empirical and semi empirical formulae the thickness of the spray is always assumed to be constant which might be not appropriate fig 22 shows the magnitude of the wall s shear stress the isolines in the sa were much denser than that of the pa and mainly parallel to the spray velocity manifesting the large gradient normal to the velocity which is caused by the decrease of velocity and spray thickness along the direction the magnitude along the spray velocity in the region is basically unchanged since the velocity and spray thickness were almost invariant in the direction begovic and bertorello 2012 provided the friction force the longitudinal components of which is the spray friction resistance of the sa of the mono hull where the mean velocity was assumed to be the velocity of the freestream the calculated reynolds numbers were in a range from 1 3 106 up to 8 106 and the ittc friction resistance formula was applied the approach of taking the boundary layer of the sa as a common boundary layer might be not feasible the comparison of the ittc calculated friction force along the spray velocity and the numerically computed friction force of this research are given in fig 23 which showed a considerable deviation some friction resistance formulae for laminar or transition flow may be more applicable in the absence of an applicable method to quantify the resistance disregarding the friction resistance of the sa might be a practical method fig 24 shows the proportion of the friction resistance in the total resistance the percent accounted for by the component was less than 5 5 conclusions this paper series introduced an improved vof method with anti ventilation techniques and the implementation of the method for hydrodynamic assessment of planing hulls the theoretical description was given in part 1 in the present paper the method was validated through predicting the hydrodynamic characteristics of an experimentally studied planing hull and compared with the results of conventional numerical methods the validation and comparison indicated that considerable accuracy improvement was achieved by the improved vof method especially in the high speed range the captured wetted surface and spray phenomenon manifested the significant elimination effect on the nv the method was also applied to investigate the shape and flow field of the sa the cfd and efd results showed that the formula to calculate the area of the sa proposed by savitsky et al 2007 might be not feasible because the area was difficult to quantify through intuitive geometric relations the computed volume fraction of water and velocity of the sa showed that the boundary layer thickness might be limited by the spray thickness the velocity of the outmost boundary layer was therefore smaller than that of the freestream leading to a low reynolds number there additionally the spray thickness and velocity varied obviously with the position resulting in the relatively large gradient of the wall shear stress magnitude there the friction resistance of the sa calculated by begovic and bertorello 2012 showed a large deviation from the cfd results since the boundary layer of the sa was assumed to be a common turbulent boundary layer in the calculation in the absence of an applicable method disregarding the resistance might be a practical method for resistance extrapolation as the friction resistance accounted for a limited

20352,in the two phase flow particle image velocimetry piv experiment of an object entering water the accurate extraction of the liquid phase region is an important step in this paper we elaborately design an effective convolutional neural network cnn called ltpnet to solve the problem of two phase flow boundary segmentation considering the supervised learning strategy we make a dataset which is based on the two phase flow piv experiment of an object entering the water the experimental results show that ltpnet can achieve high segmentation precision above 0 98 dsc on the test images meanwhile our approach can have high computational efficiency with only 2 61m parameters and a speed of 17 34 ms on a single gtx 1080ti card furthermore the cross correlation algorithm widim is used to process the images segmented by ltpnet the results show that our method can efficiently achieve the segmentation of two phase flow images and reduce the error vector of the phase edge keywords two phase flow particle image velocimetry piv convolutional neural network boundary segmentation automatic mask 1 introduction particle image velocimetry piv is a widely used technology which can provide non intrusive quantitative measurement of the velocity fields raffel and markus 2007 it plays an important role in the studies of experimental fluid mechanics in order to get a deeper insight of complex or undiscovered flow phenomena two phase flow piv measurements have been researched and reported in many experimental studies which include gas liquid liquid solid gas solid etc ergin et al 2020 deen et al 2002 in the ship and ocean engineering field piv technology has been used to investigate the flow characteristics of objects entering the water such as calculating the surface pressure distribution of objects entering the water russo et al 2018 jalalisendi and porfiri 2018 for the two phase flow piv estimation the error of the velocity vector crossing the interface is prone to occur at the boundary of different fluid flow phases therefore it is important to realize the extraction of the liquid phase and the mask of the non computing area before piv processing at present the phase separation problems in fluid mechanics experiments mainly focus on gas liquid separation and solid liquid separation sanchis and jensen 2011 ergin et al 2015 2017 traditional pre segmentation methods usually need to go through the steps of image preprocessing and edge extraction and then determine the boundary by methods such as radon transform sanchis and jensen 2011 at the same time this kind of method performs poorly in the case of more edge noise and the image with difficult edge gradient extraction an object entering water represents a complex two phase flow boundary problem which involves the coupled motion of gas liquid and solid when the object enters the surface of the water a large amount of gas will be involved to form air cavities and bubbles at the boundary layer the emergence of this phenomenon has a great impact on the capture of particle motion in the area to be measured as for this complex two phase flow boundary problem there is currently no suitable algorithm to meet the needs of practical applications in terms of recognition accuracy and calculation speed meanwhile the operation of manually masking to get the correct calculation region also wastes much manpower and time this article is dedicated to proposing a new method for automatic liquid phase extraction measured region of two phase flow images of an object entering water with the gradual maturity of deep learning technology convolutional neural network has been applied to the field of experimental fluid mechanics the excellent deep learning optical flow models are used for fluid motion estimation and obtain great results cai et al 2020 yu et al 2021 wang et al 2020 a cnn based auto encoder is proposed to perform automatic dynamic masking of some simple objects in piv images vennemann and rösgen 2020 essentially the automatic mask of the non liquid region in the two phase flow piv experiment can be deemed as a segmentation problem in computer vision this encourages us to mask complex two phase flow images using correlative convolutional neural networks in this paper we propose a cnn architecture termed as ltpnet for two phase flow segmentation aiming at the two phase flow problem of objects entering water we make a corresponding dataset to train the model parameters experimental results on the dataset demonstrate that our methods can achieve the segmentation accuracy of 98 66 dsc assessment criteria it runs on high resolution images 1024 896 at 17 34 ms on a single gtx 1080ti card with merely 2 61 m parameters 2 our approach in this section we introduce each main component of our model which includes spatial path context path and short cut path the overall structure of proposed ltpnet is shown in fig 1 then we describe the process of obtaining our dataset 2 1 network architecture design in the task of semantic segmentation the spatial information and the receptive field are crucial to achieving high accuracy we propose three paths spatial context and short cut to encode affluent spatial information and provide sufficient receptive field 2 1 1 spatial path we first use three cnn layers to extract initial features each layer includes a 3 3 convolution followed by batch normalization ioffe and szegedy 2015 and prelu activation function he et al 2015 we use prelu here because it can perform slightly better than relu due to the shallow network model after the cnn layers we adopt the same downsampling block fig 1 e with dabnet li et al 2019 initial block which is a concatenation of a 3 3 convolution and a 2 2 max pooling finally this path extracts the output feature maps which is 1 8 of the original image we adopt a lightweight module shuffle non bottleneck ss nbt fig 1 c to extract dense and deep feature information the input of ss nbt is split into two branch structure and each branch is responsible for extracting corresponding information every branch restores half of original channels by two 3 3 depth wise convolution the last depth wise convolution is replaced with dilated convolution which can capture more context information finally the convolutional outputs of two branches are merged and shuffled to enable information communication between two split branches this module enhances the deep feature expression ability of the network without significantly increasing complexity 2 1 2 context path in the semantic segmentation task to enlarge receptive field is also essential for the performance we design a context path dedicated to provide sufficient receptive field while improving reasoning speed here we adopt a lightweight model shufflenetv2 ma et al 2018 which can downsample the feature map fast to obtain large receptive field without increasing too much parameters this branch employ four downsampling operations and get 1 16 1 32 feature map resolution by step in this way we can get high level semantic context information finally we combine the different up sampled output feature by arm module fig 1 c arm is proposed in yu et al 2018 which is used to refine the features of each stage arm contains global average pooling which can capture global context information this module refines the output feature of each stage in the context path and demands negligible computation cost 2 1 3 short cut path although we obtain 1 8 feature map resolution finally which will cause a certain loss of information to some extent consequently to preserve the spatial information and details we build an efficient long range short cut path highlighted in red between the input image and each downsampling block as well as ffm module yu et al 2018 the average pooling operation can retain the average information of the area which is equivalent to supplementing the spatial information as a whole this connection downsamples the original image to the same size as the feature map and uses a cnn layer to concatenate them together it is clear that this short cut connection promotes feature reuse and compensates information loss 2 2 two phase flow dataset the dataset required for the experiment is obtained by manual operation of the two phase flow piv experimental system for more details about the dataset generation we can refer to literature chun yu et al 2021 the entry structure adopts the wedge model and the bow model first we drop the wedge and the ship stem into the liquid in a vertical free fall then we use the camera to obtain pictures through continuous photographs the final pictures obtained mainly include three stages 1 before the wedge and the ship stem contacts water the boundary between gas liquid and solid phases has obvious characteristics 2 when the wedge and the ship stem enter the water to produce a jet flow stage at this time the free liquid surface is deformed the brightness of the jet will change due to the scattering of the laser and the bow of the ship will enter the water to create a gas cavity which will cause the difficulty of liquid extraction 3 the object completely enters the water and the gas phase is basically blocked by the structure at this time a large number of bubbles are generated when the gas cavity interacts with the fluid and the bow structure and there is also a large range of laser scattering region these phenomena make it more difficult to identify the liquid phase the dataset distribution is shown in table 1 some sample images of dataset are shown in fig 2 we can see that the problem of objects entering water involves a variety of complex interferences the difficulty of identifying liquid region is beyond the ability of the existing segmentation algorithms to obtain the ground truth we take the method of manual calibration to accurately mask and segment the images of the dataset and the segmentation standard was referred to chun yu et al 2021 the ground truth corresponding to the examples in fig 2 our final two phase flow dataset contains 300 images in total 250 for training 50 for testing the images have a resolution of 1024 896 and 2 semantic categories liquid phase region and non liquid phase region 3 experiments in this section we evaluated our method on the two phase flow dataset firstly we introduce the specific implementation details then we report the results on the test set finally the images segmented by our method are processed to perform piv which proves the efficiency of our method 3 1 implementation details 3 1 1 train details our network is implemented on pytorch deep learning framework we train our models using an nvidia 1080ti gpu with batch of 10 during training we start with initial learning rate λ 1e 4 and use the adam to optimizer with weight decay 1e 8 as for the loss function we use the lovász softmax loss berman et al 2018 3 1 2 assessment criteria we choose dice similarity coefficient dsc soomro et al 2018 that is widely used in semantic segmentation tasks as the evaluation criteria the dsc is defined as follows 1 d s c 2 x y 1 x y 1 where x denotes the image segmentation region calculated by the network y denotes the corresponding ground truth 3 2 evaluation results we compare our approach with some cnn based methods also proposed for the liquid phase segmentation task of two phase flow velocimetry chun yu et al 2021 we first report our final results on two phase flow dataset then we analyze computational efficiency of different methods such as model size and running time 3 2 1 accuracy comparisons our ltpnet achieves impressive results with only 2 61 million parameters as shown in table 2 ltpnet achieves 98 66 dsc on test set which significantly outperforms existing cnn based two phase flow liquid segmentation work the error rate of our method is reduced by 7 compared with mres att unet we also noticed that the variance of our method reaches the minimum only 0 02 which shows that the ltpnet has very high stability moreover our method achieves outstanding performance with small capacity and the parameters is only 8 of the mres att unet fig 3 shows some visual examples of segmentation outputs on the test set it is demonstrated that compared with other methods our ltpnet can correctly identify the boundary of gas liquid two phase flow and has advantages in some complex boundary cases 3 2 2 computational efficiency comparison for fair comparison of speed all the runtime is computed on a single gtx 1080ti on the pytorch platform again as shown in table 2 ltpnet is able to process a 1024 896 image at the runtime of 17 34 ms moreover our method achieves outstanding performance with small capacity and the parameters is only 8 of the mres att unet our model achieves high computational efficiency and ltpnet is nearly 4 faster and 21 smaller than mres att unet this comparison represents that ltpnet can process a high resolution image with fast inference speed while maintaining high segmentation accuracy 3 3 piv processing in the two phase flow piv experiment of an object entering water the obtained velocity field can be used for a variety of fluid mechanics calculation tasks such as calculating velocity gradient pressure field distribution etc therefore the accurate calculation of the velocity field of the two phase flow image is an important core step here we first use different methods to segment and extract the liquid phase of the two phase flow images respectively note that in order to increase the reliability of the experiment we used manual calibration mc to mask the image to obtain accurate liquid phase then we use the representative piv algorithm widim scarano 2001 to compute velocity field the window iteration step size is set 32 16 in this way we can show the effect of our segmentation method in piv processing fig 4 shows the results of different two phase flow images bow into the water and wedge into the water processed by widim for two phase flow images of the bow entering the water the formation and disappearance of a dense bubbly region near the boundary will adversely affect the calculation of the velocity field of the liquid area as a result when the image is not masked the value of the velocity field where the liquid splashes is too high the velocity field become disordered fig 4 b shows a standard velocity field because the original image was manually masked accurately and after the bubbles and splashing liquid are segmented by our method the calculated velocity field in the liquid area is comparable to that of mc the velocity field obtained by method mres att unet has some wrong vectors at the top of the bow for two phase flow images of the wedge entering the water similarly the performance of our method is almost the same as that of method mres att unet and method mc our method can also demonstrate the phenomenon of high speed jet flow at the root of the wedge accumulation area effectively in addition the velocity distribution histogram in fig 5 quantitatively shows the velocity vector distribution as we can see our method has the same velocity distribution pattern as the mc method 4 conclusion in this paper aiming the liquid phase extraction of an object entering water from two phase flow piv experimental images we propose an effective convolutional neural network ltpnet for solving this key issues meanwhile we generate corresponding two phase flow dataset to train and optimize the model parameters the final results demonstrate that our ltpnet achieves state of the art performance on two phase flow dataset with high segmentation accuracy high efficiency in inference time and parameter count in the future work we will aim to construct a cascading cnn network for simultaneous two phase flow segmentation and velocity measurement in the piv experiments credit authorship contribution statement changdong yu

output feature maps which is 1 8 of the original image we adopt a lightweight module shuffle non bottleneck ss nbt fig 1 c to extract dense and deep feature information the input of ss nbt is split into two branch structure and each branch is responsible for extracting corresponding information every branch restores half of original channels by two 3 3 depth wise convolution the last depth wise convolution is replaced with dilated convolution which can capture more context information finally the convolutional outputs of two branches are merged and shuffled to enable information communication between two split branches this module enhances the deep feature expression ability of the network without significantly increasing complexity 2 1 2 context path in the semantic segmentation task to enlarge receptive field is also essential for the performance we design a context path dedicated to provide sufficient receptive field while improving reasoning speed here we adopt a lightweight model shufflenetv2 ma et al 2018 which can downsample the feature map fast to obtain large receptive field without increasing too much parameters this branch employ four downsampling operations and get 1 16 1 32 feature map resolution by step in this way we can get high level semantic context information finally we combine the different up sampled output feature by arm module fig 1 c arm is proposed in yu et al 2018 which is used to refine the features of each stage arm contains global average pooling which can capture global context information this module refines the output feature of each stage in the context path and demands negligible computation cost 2 1 3 short cut path although we obtain 1 8 feature map resolution finally which will cause a certain loss of information to some extent consequently to preserve the spatial information and details we build an efficient long range short cut path highlighted in red between the input image and each downsampling block as well as ffm module yu et al 2018 the average pooling operation can retain the average information of the area which is equivalent to supplementing the spatial information as a whole this connection downsamples the original image to the same size as the feature map and uses a cnn layer to concatenate them together it is clear that this short cut connection promotes feature reuse and compensates information loss 2 2 two phase flow dataset the dataset required for the experiment is obtained by manual operation of the two phase flow piv experimental system for more details about the dataset generation we can refer to literature chun yu et al 2021 the entry structure adopts the wedge model and the bow model first we drop the wedge and the ship stem into the liquid in a vertical free fall then we use the camera to obtain pictures through continuous photographs the final pictures obtained mainly include three stages 1 before the wedge and the ship stem contacts water the boundary between gas liquid and solid phases has obvious characteristics 2 when the wedge and the ship stem enter the water to produce a jet flow stage at this time the free liquid surface is deformed the brightness of the jet will change due to the scattering of the laser and the bow of the ship will enter the water to create a gas cavity which will cause the difficulty of liquid extraction 3 the object completely enters the water and the gas phase is basically blocked by the structure at this time a large number of bubbles are generated when the gas cavity interacts with the fluid and the bow structure and there is also a large range of laser scattering region these phenomena make it more difficult to identify the liquid phase the dataset distribution is shown in table 1 some sample images of dataset are shown in fig 2 we can see that the problem of objects entering water involves a variety of complex interferences the difficulty of identifying liquid region is beyond the ability of the existing segmentation algorithms to obtain the ground truth we take the method of manual calibration to accurately mask and segment the images of the dataset and the segmentation standard was referred to chun yu et al 2021 the ground truth corresponding to the examples in fig 2 our final two phase flow dataset contains 300 images in total 250 for training 50 for testing the images have a resolution of 1024 896 and 2 semantic categories liquid phase region and non liquid phase region 3 experiments in this section we evaluated our method on the two phase flow dataset firstly we introduce the specific implementation details then we report the results on the test set finally the images segmented by our method are processed to perform piv which proves the efficiency of our method 3 1 implementation details 3 1 1 train details our network is implemented on pytorch deep learning framework we train our models using an nvidia 1080ti gpu with batch of 10 during training we start with initial learning rate λ 1e 4 and use the adam to optimizer with weight decay 1e 8 as for the loss function we use the lovász softmax loss berman et al 2018 3 1 2 assessment criteria we choose dice similarity coefficient dsc soomro et al 2018 that is widely used in semantic segmentation tasks as the evaluation criteria the dsc is defined as follows 1 d s c 2 x y 1 x y 1 where x denotes the image segmentation region calculated by the network y denotes the corresponding ground truth 3 2 evaluation results we compare our approach with some cnn based methods also proposed for the liquid phase segmentation task of two phase flow velocimetry chun yu et al 2021 we first report our final results on two phase flow dataset then we analyze computational efficiency of different methods such as model size and running time 3 2 1 accuracy comparisons our ltpnet achieves impressive results with only 2 61 million parameters as shown in table 2 ltpnet achieves 98 66 dsc on test set which significantly outperforms existing cnn based two phase flow liquid segmentation work the error rate of our method is reduced by 7 compared with mres att unet we also noticed that the variance of our method reaches the minimum only 0 02 which shows that the ltpnet has very high stability moreover our method achieves outstanding performance with small capacity and the parameters is only 8 of the mres att unet fig 3 shows some visual examples of segmentation outputs on the test set it is demonstrated that compared with other methods our ltpnet can correctly identify the boundary of gas liquid two phase flow and has advantages in some complex boundary cases 3 2 2 computational efficiency comparison for fair comparison of speed all the runtime is computed on a single gtx 1080ti on the pytorch platform again as shown in table 2 ltpnet is able to process a 1024 896 image at the runtime of 17 34 ms moreover our method achieves outstanding performance with small capacity and the parameters is only 8 of the mres att unet our model achieves high computational efficiency and ltpnet is nearly 4 faster and 21 smaller than mres att unet this comparison represents that ltpnet can process a high resolution image with fast inference speed while maintaining high segmentation accuracy 3 3 piv processing in the two phase flow piv experiment of an object entering water the obtained velocity field can be used for a variety of fluid mechanics calculation tasks such as calculating velocity gradient pressure field distribution etc therefore the accurate calculation of the velocity field of the two phase flow image is an important core step here we first use different methods to segment and extract the liquid phase of the two phase flow images respectively note that in order to increase the reliability of the experiment we used manual calibration mc to mask the image to obtain accurate liquid phase then we use the representative piv algorithm widim scarano 2001 to compute velocity field the window iteration step size is set 32 16 in this way we can show the effect of our segmentation method in piv processing fig 4 shows the results of different two phase flow images bow into the water and wedge into the water processed by widim for two phase flow images of the bow entering the water the formation and disappearance of a dense bubbly region near the boundary will adversely affect the calculation of the velocity field of the liquid area as a result when the image is not masked the value of the velocity field where the liquid splashes is too high the velocity field become disordered fig 4 b shows a standard velocity field because the original image was manually masked accurately and after the bubbles and splashing liquid are segmented by our method the calculated velocity field in the liquid area is comparable to that of mc the velocity field obtained by method mres att unet has some wrong vectors at the top of the bow for two phase flow images of the wedge entering the water similarly the performance of our method is almost the same as that of method mres att unet and method mc our method can also demonstrate the phenomenon of high speed jet flow at the root of the wedge accumulation area effectively in addition the velocity distribution histogram in fig 5 quantitatively shows the velocity vector distribution as we can see our method has the same velocity distribution pattern as the mc method 4 conclusion in this paper aiming the liquid phase extraction of an object entering water from two phase flow piv experimental images we propose an effective convolutional neural network ltpnet for solving this key issues meanwhile we generate corresponding two phase flow dataset to train and optimize the model parameters the final results demonstrate that our ltpnet achieves state of the art performance on two phase flow dataset with high segmentation accuracy high efficiency in inference time and parameter count in the future work we will aim to construct a cascading cnn network for simultaneous two phase flow segmentation and velocity measurement in the piv experiments credit authorship contribution statement changdong yu

20353,with the aim of evaluating the effects of the selection of the wind turbulence model on the dynamic response of a semi submersible floater supporting the dtu 10 mw rwt we ran aero hydro servo elastic simulations employing the oasis code developed at ihcantabria for each of the 4 sea states selected apart from the reference case with only wave loads we analysed 30 different realizations with coupled wind and wave loads for each of the 7 full field turbulent winds generated by the turbulence simulator turbsim kaimal and von kármán spectral models with three different turbulence classes each and the api turbulence model from the resulting platform motions and mooring line dynamics it can be concluded that the selection of the wind turbulence model is not trivial at u 0 5 83 m s the obtained results show a high dependence on the turbulence class however as the wind speed increases and the wind turbine achieves the rated speed the impact of the turbulence intensity is drastically reduced and the design tension is dominated by the thrust force and thus by the vertical wind speed profile the highest design tension of the windward mooring lines is obtained with the api model at u 0 8 75 m s at least 357 tm keywords offshore wind turbine floating wind turbine wind turbulence model kaimal model api model frøya model 1 introduction the design process of floating offshore wind turbines fowts implicitly includes studying their dynamic responses to aerodynamic and hydrodynamic loads under extreme and severe operating conditions during the design lifetime these conditions are formulated in terms of the ultimate limit state uls turbulent wind fields typical of stormy sea conditions cause fowts to exhibit strong dynamic responses different guidelines provide advice for diverse turbulence models based on empirical data the international electrotechnical commission iec defines extreme marine and wind conditions as having a 50 year return period iec 61400 3 2009 the wind regime includes a constant mean flow combined with turbulence that provides random variations in the wind velocity the turbulent velocity fluctuations are assumed to be a stationary random vector field whose components have zero mean gaussian statistics the iec 61400 1 2005 standard gives two turbulence models for design load calculations the kaimal spectrum and exponential coherence model kaimal et al 1972 and the mann uniform shear turbulence model mann 1994 the latter model is defined in terms of the isotropic von kármán energy spectrum von karman 1948 that is rapidly distorted by a uniform mean velocity shear although the spatial coherence of the von kármán and kaimal spectral models is identical their energy frequency contents are different and depend on the turbulence class moreover both models were designed using onshore measurements whereas few turbulence models have been specifically developed based on marine wind data cheynet et al 2017 the principal worldwide standard for the design of offshore structures is iso 19901 1 2015 based on this recognized international standard the american petroleum institute api and the norwegian petroleum industry developed their domestic standards api rp 2sk 2005 and norsok n 003 2007 respectively and the dnv gl classification society published its os e301 2018 rp 0286 2018 rp c205 2017 st 0119 2018 standards for the maritime oil and gas and energy industries these guidelines provide extreme met ocean conditions and methods to design the position moorings of offshore structures under the consequent hydrodynamic and aerodynamic loads these standards recommend either a 50 year or a 100 year return period for wind and waves and advise the use of the api turbulence model for the marine boundary layer mbl the api turbulence model also known as the frøya wind spectrum since it is based on field measurements in the frøya municipality along the norwegian coast andersen and løvseth 1992 is a generalization of the harris 1971 and kaimal spectra with special consideration given to the low frequency range while keeping the correct high frequency asymptote andersen and løvseth 2006 the api spatial coherence similar to the kaimal coherence is based on extensions of the original exponential formulation by davenport 1977 ochi and shin 1988 reviewed the different offshore wind spectra measured since the end of the 1970s and showed that they are similar in the high frequency domain but display significant differences in the low frequency range 0 01 hz which highlights the dependence of the latter range on the site for which the model was developed wind spectra for offshore locations contain low frequency components of higher magnitude than those for land based locations ochi and shin 1988 shiotani 1975 wills et al 1986 thus the use of an averaging time larger than the standard value of 10 min advised by iec 61400 1 2005 os e301 2018 may be required normalized spectra comparisons for the kaimal esdu also referred to as the improved von kármán and api turbulence models at several wind speeds are shown in fig 1 rp 0286 2018 although the fact that the stochastic wind speed process remains stationary over time intervals of 40 min does not always hold true rp c205 2017 there is no such thing as a strict lower limit to the range of application of the spectral model and longer periods of load data ensure statistical reliability of the spectral estimate of the characteristic load effect in fact bachynski and eliassen 2019 cheynet et al 2017 esdu 86010 2001 wise and bachynski 2019 all used an averaging time of 1 h to capture the effects of long periods and to increase the accuracy of the estimated turbulence statistics moreover in the absence of information defining the long term joint probability distribution of extreme wind and waves iec 61400 3 2009 recommended assuming that the extreme 10 min mean wind speed with a 50 year return period occurs during the extreme 3 h sea state with a 50 year return period the reason is that for extreme and fatigue load cases the wind is assumed to be stationary in time during which the statistical properties do not change rp 0286 2018 at most when using the extreme 1 h mean wind speed with a 50 year return period to generate a wind time series of 3 h duration the standard deviation over this longer time period may be expected to be slightly larger for a given turbulence spectrum nevertheless this assumption will not substantially affect the simulation results as turbulent scale motions do not have considerable energy in the low frequency range because of the spectral gap van der hoven 1957 in addition atmospheric stability strongly influences the low frequency range of the wind spectrum plate 1982 the api spectrum was established based on measurements made over the high latitude ocean of the north sea during the passage of large scale low pressure systems andersen and løvseth 2006 in the neutral mbl turbulence is produced mechanically in the surface layer in contrast at lower latitudes the dominant convection causes the important characteristics of weather phenomena to be different the logarithmic velocity profile associated with neutral atmospheric stability typical of low pressure areas is no longer valid for high pressure areas since thermal or convection turbulence is added to mechanical or frictional turbulence under stable atmospheric conditions the air is cooled from the bottom up while under unstable conditions the ocean warms the atmosphere pimenta et al 2019 unstable stratification may be predominant in offshore environments because of the high thermal mass of the sea archer et al 2016 coelingh et al 1996 westerhellweg et al 2014 wills and cole 1989 kaimal et al 1972 found that neutral spectra approached from the unstable side have significantly more energy at low frequencies than neutral spectra approached from the stable side although the effects of non neutral conditions are likely to be profound in the low frequency range at low latitudes for moderate wind speeds when focusing on extreme conditions a wider treatment of stability effects is of limited value the reason is that in extreme value analysis the wind speed considered has a 50 or 100 year return period and such winds will always be neutral because the turbulence in strong winds is almost wholly due to mechanical stirring caused by surface friction barltrop and adams 1991 when analysing the fatigue limit state fls and severe sea state as most of the damage occurs in strong winds using neutral conditions will also give a good approximation of the real damage compared with a bottom fixed offshore wind turbine a fowt is more sensitive to low frequency variations in the flow across the rotor bachynski and eliassen 2019 as this flow affects its dynamic response to analyse the turbine aeroelastic response and loading the numerical simulation of a coherent inflow turbulence environment becomes necessary turbsim jonkman 2016 is a stochastic full field turbulent wind simulator for the kaimal and von kármán spectral models specified by the iec and the api turbulence model based on maritime frøya data turbsim uses a statistical model as opposed to a physics based model to numerically simulate the time series of three component wind speed vectors at points in a two dimensional vertical rectangular grid that is fixed in space the spectra of the velocity components and spatial coherence are defined in the frequency domain and an inverse fourier transform produces time series the underlying theory behind this method of simulating time series assumes a stationary process the three models implemented in turbsim assume neutral atmospheric stability the velocity spectra and standard deviations of these three models are assumed to be invariant across the grid in practice a small amount of variation in the u component standard deviation occurs due to the spatial coherence model the spatial coherence between points i and j on the plane grid normal to the longitudinal direction adds correlation between the same wind speed components at two spatially separated points ui uj correlation in contrast there is no spatial coherence either in the lateral or in the vertical wind components bachynski and eliassen 2019 focused on the different results obtained from analyses of the dynamic response of the nrel 5 mw floating wind turbine by using the two wind field models of differing spatial coherence recommended by the iec standard method the simulations performed by godvik 2016 have already shown that the mooring responses of the hywind 6 mw floating wind turbines were sensitive to the turbulence model used wise and bachynski 2019 used the dtu 10 mw wind reference turbine supported by the csc semi submersible platform in their computational analysis and added a new third intermediate kaimal turbulence model including spatial coherence in the lateral and vertical velocity components the aforementioned works carried out dynamic analyses for a range of wind speeds where the turbine is operational with the most likely significant wave height hs and peak wave period tp the aims of this study are to quantify the dynamic response of a semi submersible wind turbine and the impact on the mooring system dynamics expand the comparison to different iec turbulence classes and non iec turbulence models such as the api model and analyse extreme and severe operating conditions as part of the design process in terms of the uls moreover we generate 30 different realizations of the wind time series under each environmental condition allowing us to obtain statistically reliable design tensions of mooring lines by applying a time domain method the present paper is meant to distinguish the contributions of waves and wind separately and to compare the different results that can be obtained by using standard methods from the industry to ultimately determine which wind field is most conservative under each environmental condition section 2 describes the 90 m depth offshore site off the northern coast of spain to which the case study refers and the representative operational conditions chosen presents the characteristics of the original 10 mw rwt supported by the rescaled deepcwind platform and introduces our in house numerical model oasis employed for aero hydro servo elastic simulations with the different turbulent patterns used to generate the wind inflow sections 3 and 4 present a discussion of the simulation results and conclusions respectively 2 methodology to investigate the effects of different wind turbulence models on the motions of a semi submersible floating wind turbine and on the mooring system dynamics the methodology described in fig 2 is proposed first long term extreme wind sea states are selected according to the met ocean hindcast data for the reference location second hydrodynamic and aerodynamic loads are simulated separately for each environmental load case on the one hand incoming irregular wave time series are reconstructed by means of a discrete fourier transform dft algorithm the wave amplitudes used in the dft algorithm are obtained from the jonswap spectrum which allows us to relate hs and tp to the wave energy distribution along the frequencies on the other hand full field turbulent wind inflows are generated by the stochastic simulator turbsim introduced in section 1 finally both dynamic loads are coupled using the in house code oasis to model the dynamic response of the rescaled semi submersible wind turbine for which the model has been previously calibrated the time series output analysed in this study will be the surge heave and pitch motions of the platform response as well as the tensions on the windward mooring lines 2 1 turbulence models the kaimal and von kármán iec turbulence models apply a vertical power law wind speed profile to the rotor disk 1 u z u 0 z 10 α where z is the height above sea level u0 is the 1 h mean wind speed at a reference elevation of 10 m above sea level and the power law exponent α 0 14 for the offshore normal turbulence model ntm iec 61400 3 2009 the non iec api turbulence model in contrast uses a logarithmic profile for the mean wind speed 2 u z u κ l n z z 0 where κ 0 4 the surface roughness z0 and the friction velocity u are related by the charnock relation over the sea charnock 1955 3 z 0 a g u 2 where g is the acceleration due to gravity and the charnock constant a 0 0172 was determined experimentally by andersen and løvseth 2006 on the other hand the spectra of the kaimal model for the three wind components k u v w are given by 4 s k f 4 σ k 2 l k u h u b 1 6 f l k u h u b 5 3 where f is the cyclic frequency and uhub is the mean wind speed at hub height lk is the integral scale parameter defined to be 5 l k 8 10 λ u i f k u 2 70 λ u i f k v 0 66 λ u i f k w where λ u 0 7 min 60 m z hub is the turbulence scale parameter with zhub being the hub height σk denotes the standard deviations for the three wind components whose relationships are defined to be 6 σ u i u 0 75 u 0 5 6 m s f o r n t m σ v 0 8 σ u σ w 0 5 σ u where the turbulence intensity iu depends on the turbulence class the velocity spectra of the von kármán model assume isotropic turbulence its longitudinal wind component is given by 7 s u f 4 σ u 2 l u hub 1 71 fl u hub 2 5 6 and its lateral and vertical wind components k v w respectively are given by 8 s k f 2 σ k 2 l u h u b 1 71 f l u h u b 2 11 6 1 189 f l u h u b 2 where l 3 5 λ u and σ v σ w σ u the spectra of the api model for the lateral and vertical wind components are defined as the kaimal spectra the u component spectrum for wind over water in contrast is given by 9 s u f 320 u 0 10 2 z 10 0 45 1 172 f u 0 10 3 4 z 10 2 3 n 5 3 n where the coefficient n 0 468 finally the kaimal and von kármán iec turbulence models define the spatial coherence spectrum of the longitudinal velocity component as 10 c o h i j f s i j f s i i f s j j f e x p 12 f r u h u b 2 0 12 r l u 2 where r y j y i 2 z j z i 2 is the magnitude of the projection of the separation vector between points i and j onto a plane normal to the average wind direction the squared correlation between the spectral energy densities of the longitudinal wind speed fluctuations of frequency f between 2 points in space for the api turbulence model is given by 11 c o h i j f e x p 1 u 0 2 9 f 0 92 x j x i z g 0 4 2 45 f 0 92 y j y i z g 0 4 2 13 f 0 85 z j z

bimep has an open sea testing facility 2 km offshore of the coastal town of armintza northern spain that covers a total surface area of 5 2 km2 the left side of fig 3 shows the dimensions of the bimep site and the location of the wavescan buoy 2 8848 e 43 4682 n 80 m depth that collects the field met ocean data described in trl 2017 on the right the bathymetric map of the bimep site resulting from a survey conducted by acciona energía in september 2010 is presented with a high resolution of 1 m at depths ranging from 50 to 90 m fig 4 presents the mean met ocean conditions at the bimep site trl 2017 the wind speed increase on the left shows that winds blow generally from the west south and east with the winds from the west being the most frequent and strongest the average wind speed at 10 m above the surface is 5 86 m s and the weibull distribution offers the best adjustment the log normal type is the distribution that best adjusts to the significant wave height and the predominant regime of waves comes from the northwest as can be clearly seen in the significant wave height rose diagram on the right sea states are defined by combining met ocean hindcasts and instrumental data using statistical techniques wind and wave resource assessments at global regional and local scales require the use of numerical databases due to the coarse spatial resolution of instrumental measurements in this work the wind characteristics and wave spectral data are provided by the bimep wavescan buoy and by the anteia buoy respectively numerical databases provide long time series that allow the wind and wave performance to be characterized in the long term the data used in this research are derived from the reanalysis database in trl 2017 undisturbed mean wind speeds and directions such as the significant wave heights wave peak periods and prevailing wave directions for the period of 1985 2015 are provided with a resolution of 1 h met ocean hindcasts are used to assess the long term environmental conditions in a specific location the selection of severe sea states is based on the application of the inverse first order reliability method iform whose main target is to predict the long term met ocean conditions generating an environmental contour corresponding to a certain return period haver and winterstein 2008 del jesus et al 2015 thus to estimate the long term extreme sea states barrera et al 2019 applied the iform to a short term analysis and different return periods the extreme wind conditions 90 m above the surface and the wave conditions are characterized in fig 5 four load cases were selected on the contour line of the 50 year return period yellow line covering the range associated with the maximum peak wave period from the mean wind speed to the maximum significant wave height 2 3 definition of the semi submersible wind turbine the simulated platform is of the semi submersible type and it is a rescaled shape of the deepcwind platform described in robertson et al 2017 the platform has three exterior main columns which ensure the platform floatability and stability and a central column that supports the wind turbine fig 6 the exterior columns are distributed at the vertices of an equilateral triangle and the central column is at the barycentre the four columns are connected by means of bracings to ensure the structural integrity of the platform the rescaling process was performed to fit the dtu 10 mw rwt in the deepcwind platform while maintaining the dynamical properties of a floating wind turbine as realistically as possible thus during the rescaling process variables such as the platform restoring capacity seakeeping behaviour and operativity were checked to maintain them as realistically as possible the mooring system is composed of three lines each of which is attached to an exterior column the fairlead positions are at the base part of the exterior columns the mooring system was designed to cope with the requirements of the bimep site which has a depth of 90 m and to be compliant with the os e301 2018 standard the dtu 10 mw rwt controller was adapted to cope with the platform dynamics fig 7 the tuning procedure was carried out thanks to the oasys numerical model targeting the optimal compromise between the platform behaviour and turbine performance 2 4 model description the dynamic response of the fowt system has been simulated numerically with oasis the hydro aero servo elastic code developed at ihcantabria the fowt system is modelled based on a set of reference systems including a global system and several local references placed across the floating turbine structure the origin of the global reference frame is located at the centre of gravity cog of the fowt system with initial conditions the x axis is positive downwind aligned with the direction of wind and waves the z axis is positive upward and the y axis direction is given by the right hand rule oasis is a time domain metaphysics solver that is able to simulate wave load effects mooring systems and wind turbines wave load physics are represented in the model by means of the cummins equation so the added mass and damping coefficients come from a linear flow potential model that does not represent the viscosity effects to accurately simulate the platform displacements and rotations it is necessary to add viscosity effects in the present case viscosity effects have been added through a calibration of the model with the experimental campaign performed during the trl project the calibration procedure was performed using a decay test by adding a viscosity coefficient linear and nonlinear parts to fit the decay rate in each of the 6 degrees of freedom dofs fig 8 and fig 9 show the decay tests and results of the calibrated model respectively for the platform heave displacements and pitch rotations for each sea state of the 4 previously selected cases apart from the reference case with only wave loads we generate 7 full field turbulent winds related to three different turbulence models and different turbulence intensities for the kaimal and von kármán spectral models we simulate the three different turbulence classes to analyse the effect of the turbulence intensity class a designates the category for higher turbulence characteristics i u 0 16 class b designates the category for medium turbulence characteristics i u 0 14 and class c designates the category for lower turbulence characteristics i u 0 12 at u h u b 15 m s iec 61400 1 2005 the api model has a turbulence intensity of 0 08 for this mean wind speed at hub height table 1 summarizes the 32 cases considered in the present study for each environmental condition in the 28 cases considered with coupled wind and wave loads 30 different realizations of the inflow winds were generated using the stochastic full field turbulence simulator turbsim therefore it is possible to obtain statistically reliable design tension values of the mooring lines from each realization we obtained a set of maximum values that were statistically analysed according to the position mooring standards os e301 2018 these 844 simulations including the 4 reference cases were run in neptuno a high performance computing hpc cluster held by ihcantabria composed of 1276 cores its 5 tb of ram and 130 tb of disk space allow the computational manageability of a large number of simulations each simulated realization has a 3 h duration after the transient response with a temporal resolution of 0 05 s the yz cross plane grid has a height of 250 m a width of 250 m and a grid point matrix dimension of 32 32 note that in contrast to the iec models the velocity spectrum of the api model varies along the grid with height 3 results 3 1 motion response sensitivity of the semi submersible wind turbine to turbulence modelling this section aims to demonstrate the influence of turbulence models on platform motions the simulated displacements and rotations refer to the centre of mass of the semi submersible floating platform measured with respect to the global reference system fig 10 presents the power spectral responses of the heave displacements for the different wind turbulence models studied in each sea state the heave motion spectra of the floating platform with only wave loads as a reference are also depicted and there is no difference between the spectra with and without wind sea states hence we can conclude that the impact of wind turbulence on the heave displacement response of the floater is limited regardless of the mean wind speed the frequency domain analysis of the heave movement shows that all the energy of the heave motion is located within the range of the wave frequencies for the larger period sea states i e t p 21 60 s 0 046 h z t p 20 93 s 0 048 h z and t p 20 12 s 0 050 h z however for the shorter wave period t p 17 15 s 0 058 h z the energy peak appears around the heave natural frequency 0 052 hz as a result of the lock in phenomenon following the above analysis fig 11 shows the power spectral responses of the obtained surge displacements in this case there are energy peaks in two separate ranges of frequencies at high frequencies from 0 046 hz to 0 058 hz the surge response is not affected by the wind load and it depends only on the wave frequency of each sea state conversely at low frequencies the surge motions of the platform are dominated by the wind conditions clarifying the differences between the turbulence models used for every wind sea state the low frequency peak energy appears around the surge natural frequency 0 004 hz and it has a higher value as the turbulence intensity is increased from 0 08 api model to 0 16 iec models of class a at a mean wind speed of 5 83 m s the von kármán models have a larger energy content than the kaimal models and a much larger energy content than the api model we can use the zeroth order spectral moment to quantify the spectral energy density in the frequency domain from 0 to 0 012 hz where most of the wind information is located the m0 of the api model represents only 5 1 of that of the von kármán model with turbulence class a as u0 is increased the importance of the wind loads is reduced relative to that of the wave loads moreover the spectral analysis reveals that the low frequency kaimal power energy surpasses the von kármán power energy in agreement with fig 1 the higher dependence of turbulence given by the api model as the mean wind speed is increased is also demonstrated in fig 11 thus at u 0 17 94 m s and for the same low frequency domain from 0 to 0 012 hz the m0 of the api model represents 40 2 of that of the kaimal model with turbulence class a the power spectral responses of the pitch rotations are presented in fig 12 at higher mean wind velocities the response of the platform is approximately dominated by the pitch natural frequency 0 027 hz the higher the turbulence intensity is the higher the zeroth order spectral moment between 0 and 0 035 hz at u 0 17 94 m s and for this frequency domain the m0 of the api model represents 9 7 of that of the von kármán model with turbulence class a at lower u0 the wind turbine does not achieve the rated speed fig 7 and the platform pitch behaviour is affected only by wind fluctuations at frequencies one order of magnitude smaller note that the api model uses a vertical logarithmic wind speed profile instead of a power law profile as the iec models do which is the reason why the platform pitch motions for the api model are highly influenced by the proportional integral derivative pid blade pitch controller frequency from u 0 11 76 m s instead of 8 75 m s as in the iec models to better understand the differences between the turbulence models considered fig 12 presents magnified plots of the power spectral responses of the pitch rotations it is important to mention that as u0 is increased from 5 83 m s to 8 75 m s at wave frequencies the api power energy surpasses the power energy in all of the iec models increasing m0 between 0 035 and 0 080 hz from 64 7 to 126 1 of that of the von kármán model with turbulence class a statistical values of the heave top and surge displacements bottom left as well as the pitch rotations bottom right are shown in fig 13 as a function of u0 the mean heave motions of the floating platform as well as the minimum and maximum values are independent of the wind loads in agreement with the power spectral responses shown in fig 10 the highest mean and maximum values appear with the severe sea state h s 9 50 m and t p 20 12 s related to u 0 11 76 m s the same curve shape can be seen in the surge motions of the platform only with wave loads due to second order wave forces nevertheless with coupled wind and wave loads the gradients of the mean surge curves are dominated by the thrust force on the wind turbine and thus by the mean wind speed at hub height the api model surpasses the iec models at u 0 8 75 m s because its vertical logarithmic wind speed profile results in u hub 10 71 m s approaching the maximum thrust while the power law profile of the iec models reaches u hub 12 55 m s and is already on the back side of the thrust curve fig 7 the differences between the iec models are reflected in their maximum and minimum curves with the standard deviation increasing as the turbulence intensity is increased this is emphasized even more in the plots of the pitch rotations in this case although the mean values are dominated by the turbine thrust the extreme values are dependent on second order wave forces 3 2 impact on the mooring system dynamics in this section an analysis of the resulting mooring line tensions is presented the mooring lines are equispaced at 120 and connected to each floater of the triangular semi submersible platform mooring line 3 is aligned with the x axis of the global coordinate system on the leeward side of the floating wind platform while mooring lines 1 and 2 are on the windward side with a non zero component in the y direction and are oriented symmetrically with respect to the x direction the power spectra of the two windward mooring line tensions for the seven different wind turbulence models studied with the reference case having only wave loads are shown at the sea states related to u0 values of 5 83 m s and 8 75 m s in fig 14 at low mean wind speeds the windward mooring line tensions present two peaks of energy content and both are dominated by wind loads the range of low frequencies has a maximum power appearing around the surge natural frequency 0 004 hz and the peak in the other frequency range appears at the wave frequency of each sea state 0 046 hz and 0 048 hz at u 0 5 83 m s both maxima attain higher values as the turbulence intensity increases from 0 08 api model to 0 16 iec models of class a from 0 035 to 0 080 hz the m0 of the reference case with only wave loads represents only 3 5 of the von kármán model with turbulence class a as u0 is increased to 8 75 m s and the importance of low frequencies is reduced relative to that of wave frequencies the kaimal power energy at low frequencies surpasses the von kármán power energy at low frequencies and the difference from the api model is reduced moreover at wave frequencies the differences between the iec models are not clear and the api power energy surpasses the power energy in all the iec models increasing the m0 between 0 035 and 0 080 hz from 45 3 to approximately 160 of that of the von kármán model with turbulence class a fig 15 shows the power spectra of the two windward mooring line tensions at the sea states related to high mean wind speeds as u0 is increased from 8 75 m s to 11 76 m s and the severe sea state is reached fig 13 the relative importance of waves in terms of energy continues to grow however the m0 of the api model between 0 035 and 0 080 hz is reduced to approximately 130 of that of the von kármán model with turbulence class a since the differences in the turbine thrust decrease magnified plots in fig 12 for the same reason the relative m0 of the api model with respect to the von kármán model with a high turbulence intensity continues to decrease from 130 to 120 while the relative energy dominance of wave frequencies is reduced at the extremal sea state of hsmax with u 0 17 94 m s this energy peak no longer appears at a wave frequency but at the heave natural frequency 0 052 hz as a result of the lock in phenomenon the m0 of the reference case with only wave loads between 0 035 and 0 080 hz represents approximately 12 of that of the von kármán model with turbulence class a moreover there is a perceptible third energy peak dominated by wind loads at the pitch natural frequency 0 027 hz the statistical values of the tensions in the windward mooring lines as a function of u0 are shown in fig 16 the highest mean and maximum values of the reference case with only wave loads appear in the severe sea state related to u 0 11 76 m s due to second order wave forces conversely the curve gradients of the cases with coupled wind and wave loads are dominated by the turbine thrust hence the api model surpasses the iec models at u 0 8 75 m s and the difference between the iec models and the non iec model is reduced as the mean wind speed increases on the other hand the differences between the iec models are reflected in their maximum curves being more dependent on second order wave forces as the turbulence intensity is increased the design tension of a mooring line is estimated as the most probable maximum mpm value of the gumbel distribution for the line tension the mpm value of the gumbel distribution corresponds to the 37 percentile and is given by 12 mpm μ 0 45 σ where μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation of the maxima observed from each of the 30 simulations the gumbel distributions of the two windward mooring line tensions for the seven different wind turbulence models analysed are shown at low mean wind velocities in fig 17 the mpm values of these extreme value distributions for mooring line tensions are marked with dashed dotted lines the gumbel distributions of the extreme values corresponding to the first sea state at u 0 5 83 m s are highly dependent on the turbulence class in agreement with its negligible energy content at low velocities the api model presents the smallest standard deviation and the lowest mpm values for the iec models the higher the turbulence intensity is the higher the mpm value as u0 increases to 8 75 m s the mpm values of the api model surpass those of the iec models due to the thrust force of the wind turbine as the power content at wave frequencies rises in relative importance at this mean wind speed fig 14 the mpm values are not highly influenced by the turbulence intensity moreover the variability between the mpm values of the iec models in the two windward mooring lines is presented as a consequence of roll and yaw rotations induced by the wind turbine at the rated speed fig 18 shows the gumbel distributions of the two windward mooring line tensions at u0 values of 11 76 m s and 17 94 m s upon increasing the mean wind velocity the api model maintains the largest mpm values for the tensions of the windward mooring lines for the iec models the higher the turbulence intensity is the higher the standard deviation of the gumbel distributions for the mooring line tensions in agreement with fig 16 in summary we present the mpm values with the 5th and 95th percentile values of the gumbel distributions in fig 19 as a function of the mean wind speed at u 0 5 83 m s the mpm values are highly dependent on the turbulence intensity and those of the api model may be underestimated on the other hand the mooring dynamics are governed by the surge response of the platform but with non negligible contributions from heave and pitch motions hence the combination of turbine thrust and waves is decisive for the maximum thrust force figs 14 and 15 the design tensions of the windward mooring lines are defined at u 0 8 75 m s and a maximum value of at least 357 tm is obtained for the api model in addition in severe sea states with u 0 11 76 m s the 95th percentile values of the gumbel distributions for the kaimal models are clearly higher than those for the von kármán models 4 conclusions the dynamic response of a rescaled deepcwind platform supporting the dtu 10 mw rwt has been simulated numerically under different wind turbulence models with oasis the hydro aero servo elastic code developed by ihcantabria for each of the 4 load cases selected at the offshore site of the bimep area with a 50 year return period for wind and waves apart from the reference case with only wave loads we have generated 7 full field turbulent winds using turbsim kaimal and von kármán spectral models with three different turbulence classes each and the api turbulence model with the lowest turbulence intensity for the 28 cases analysed with coupled wind and wave loads we have run 30 different realizations of 3 h duration after the transient response with a temporal resolution of 0 05 s the following conclusions are drawn the heave displacements of the platform exhibit no dependence on wind loads the highest mean and maximum values appear with the severe sea state the mean values of surge motions are dominated by the thrust force and thus by the vertical wind speed profile the highest mean value is obtained with the api model at u 0 8 75 m s which is 9 9 larger than the value obtained with the iec models on the other hand the higher the turbulence intensity is the higher the standard deviations of the surge displacements at u 0 5 83 m s the gradients of the mean pitch curves are similar to those of the surge curves and the standard deviations also rise as the turbulence intensity increases however under this degree of freedom the highest standard deviation is obtained in the severe sea state at u 0 11 76 m s and for the same turbulence class the von kármán model presents larger variability than the kaimal model surge displacements dominate the mooring dynamics but with non negligible influences on heave and pitch motions the highest mean value of the windward mooring lines is obtained with the api model at u 0 8 75 m s and the api value is at least 18 7 larger than that obtained with the iec models on the other hand the higher the turbulence intensity is the higher the standard deviations of the windward mooring lines at u 0 5 83 m s the highest design tension of the windward mooring lines is obtained with the api model at u 0 8 75 m s at least 357 tm on the other hand the higher the turbulence intensity is the higher the design tension of the windward mooring lines at u 0 5 83 m s it is clear that a mooring system may not be designed without coupling wind loads to wave loads moreover the selection of the wind turbulence model is not trivial as the design tension of the windward mooring lines is highly dependent on the turbulence model used once the wind turbine has achieved the rated speed the api model may be used to remain on the conservative side conversely at lower u0 when the wind turbine has not yet achieved the rated speed iec models with turbulence class a may be used instead to achieve higher safety levels

20353,with the aim of evaluating the effects of the selection of the wind turbulence model on the dynamic response of a semi submersible floater supporting the dtu 10 mw rwt we ran aero hydro servo elastic simulations employing the oasis code developed at ihcantabria for each of the 4 sea states selected apart from the reference case with only wave loads we analysed 30 different realizations with coupled wind and wave loads for each of the 7 full field turbulent winds generated by the turbulence simulator turbsim kaimal and von kármán spectral models with three different turbulence classes each and the api turbulence model from the resulting platform motions and mooring line dynamics it can be concluded that the selection of the wind turbulence model is not trivial at u 0 5 83 m s the obtained results show a high dependence on the turbulence class however as the wind speed increases and the wind turbine achieves the rated speed the impact of the turbulence intensity is drastically reduced and the design tension is dominated by the thrust force and thus by the vertical wind speed profile the highest design tension of the windward mooring lines is obtained with the api model at u 0 8 75 m s at least 357 tm keywords offshore wind turbine floating wind turbine wind turbulence model kaimal model api model frøya model 1 introduction the design process of floating offshore wind turbines fowts implicitly includes studying their dynamic responses to aerodynamic and hydrodynamic loads under extreme and severe operating conditions during the design lifetime these conditions are formulated in terms of the ultimate limit state uls turbulent wind fields typical of stormy sea conditions cause fowts to exhibit strong dynamic responses different guidelines provide advice for diverse turbulence models based on empirical data the international electrotechnical commission iec defines extreme marine and wind conditions as having a 50 year return period iec 61400 3 2009 the wind regime includes a constant mean flow combined with turbulence that provides random variations in the wind velocity the turbulent velocity fluctuations are assumed to be a stationary random vector field whose components have zero mean gaussian statistics the iec 61400 1 2005 standard gives two turbulence models for design load calculations the kaimal spectrum and exponential coherence model kaimal et al 1972 and the mann uniform shear turbulence model mann 1994 the latter model is defined in terms of the isotropic von kármán energy spectrum von karman 1948 that is rapidly distorted by a uniform mean velocity shear although the spatial coherence of the von kármán and kaimal spectral models is identical their energy frequency contents are different and depend on the turbulence class moreover both models were designed using onshore measurements whereas few turbulence models have been specifically developed based on marine wind data cheynet et al 2017 the principal worldwide standard for the design of offshore structures is iso 19901 1 2015 based on this recognized international standard the american petroleum institute api and the norwegian petroleum industry developed their domestic standards api rp 2sk 2005 and norsok n 003 2007 respectively and the dnv gl classification society published its os e301 2018 rp 0286 2018 rp c205 2017 st 0119 2018 standards for the maritime oil and gas and energy industries these guidelines provide extreme met ocean conditions and methods to design the position moorings of offshore structures under the consequent hydrodynamic and aerodynamic loads these standards recommend either a 50 year or a 100 year return period for wind and waves and advise the use of the api turbulence model for the marine boundary layer mbl the api turbulence model also known as the frøya wind spectrum since it is based on field measurements in the frøya municipality along the norwegian coast andersen and løvseth 1992 is a generalization of the harris 1971 and kaimal spectra with special consideration given to the low frequency range while keeping the correct high frequency asymptote andersen and løvseth 2006 the api spatial coherence similar to the kaimal coherence is based on extensions of the original exponential formulation by davenport 1977 ochi and shin 1988 reviewed the different offshore wind spectra measured since the end of the 1970s and showed that they are similar in the high frequency domain but display significant differences in the low frequency range 0 01 hz which highlights the dependence of the latter range on the site for which the model was developed wind spectra for offshore locations contain low frequency components of higher magnitude than those for land based locations ochi and shin 1988 shiotani 1975 wills et al 1986 thus the use of an averaging time larger than the standard value of 10 min advised by iec 61400 1 2005 os e301 2018 may be required normalized spectra comparisons for the kaimal esdu also referred to as the improved von kármán and api turbulence models at several wind speeds are shown in fig 1 rp 0286 2018 although the fact that the stochastic wind speed process remains stationary over time intervals of 40 min does not always hold true rp c205 2017 there is no such thing as a strict lower limit to the range of application of the spectral model and longer periods of load data ensure statistical reliability of the spectral estimate of the characteristic load effect in fact bachynski and eliassen 2019 cheynet et al 2017 esdu 86010 2001 wise and bachynski 2019 all used an averaging time of 1 h to capture the effects of long periods and to increase the accuracy of the estimated turbulence statistics moreover in the absence of information defining the long term joint probability distribution of extreme wind and waves iec 61400 3 2009 recommended assuming that the extreme 10 min mean wind speed with a 50 year return period occurs during the extreme 3 h sea state with a 50 year return period the reason is that for extreme and fatigue load cases the wind is assumed to be stationary in time during which the statistical properties do not change rp 0286 2018 at most when using the extreme 1 h mean wind speed with a 50 year return period to generate a wind time series of 3 h duration the standard deviation over this longer time period may be expected to be slightly larger for a given turbulence spectrum nevertheless this assumption will not substantially affect the simulation results as turbulent scale motions do not have considerable energy in the low frequency range because of the spectral gap van der hoven 1957 in addition atmospheric stability strongly influences the low frequency range of the wind spectrum plate 1982 the api spectrum was established based on measurements made over the high latitude ocean of the north sea during the passage of large scale low pressure systems andersen and løvseth 2006 in the neutral mbl turbulence is produced mechanically in the surface layer in contrast at lower latitudes the dominant convection causes the important characteristics of weather phenomena to be different the logarithmic velocity profile associated with neutral atmospheric stability typical of low pressure areas is no longer valid for high pressure areas since thermal or convection turbulence is added to mechanical or frictional turbulence under stable atmospheric conditions the air is cooled from the bottom up while under unstable conditions the ocean warms the atmosphere pimenta et al 2019 unstable stratification may be predominant in offshore environments because of the high thermal mass of the sea archer et al 2016 coelingh et al 1996 westerhellweg et al 2014 wills and cole 1989 kaimal et al 1972 found that neutral spectra approached from the unstable side have significantly more energy at low frequencies than neutral spectra approached from the stable side although the effects of non neutral conditions are likely to be profound in the low frequency range at low latitudes for moderate wind speeds when focusing on extreme conditions a wider treatment of stability effects is of limited value the reason is that in extreme value analysis the wind speed considered has a 50 or 100 year return period and such winds will always be neutral because the turbulence in strong winds is almost wholly due to mechanical stirring caused by surface friction barltrop and adams 1991 when analysing the fatigue limit state fls and severe sea state as most of the damage occurs in strong winds using neutral conditions will also give a good approximation of the real damage compared with a bottom fixed offshore wind turbine a fowt is more sensitive to low frequency variations in the flow across the rotor bachynski and eliassen 2019 as this flow affects its dynamic response to analyse the turbine aeroelastic response and loading the numerical simulation of a coherent inflow turbulence environment becomes necessary turbsim jonkman 2016 is a stochastic full field turbulent wind simulator for the kaimal and von kármán spectral models specified by the iec and the api turbulence model based on maritime frøya data turbsim uses a statistical model as opposed to a physics based model to numerically simulate the time series of three component wind speed vectors at points in a two dimensional vertical rectangular grid that is fixed in space the spectra of the velocity components and spatial coherence are defined in the frequency domain and an inverse fourier transform produces time series the underlying theory behind this method of simulating time series assumes a stationary process the three models implemented in turbsim assume neutral atmospheric stability the velocity spectra and standard deviations of these three models are assumed to be invariant across the grid in practice a small amount of variation in the u component standard deviation occurs due to the spatial coherence model the spatial coherence between points i and j on the plane grid normal to the longitudinal direction adds correlation between the same wind speed components at two spatially separated points ui uj correlation in contrast there is no spatial coherence either in the lateral or in the vertical wind components bachynski and eliassen 2019 focused on the different results obtained from analyses of the dynamic response of the nrel 5 mw floating wind turbine by using the two wind field models of differing spatial coherence recommended by the iec standard method the simulations performed by godvik 2016 have already shown that the mooring responses of the hywind 6 mw floating wind turbines were sensitive to the turbulence model used wise and bachynski 2019 used the dtu 10 mw wind reference turbine supported by the csc semi submersible platform in their computational analysis and added a new third intermediate kaimal turbulence model including spatial coherence in the lateral and vertical velocity components the aforementioned works carried out dynamic analyses for a range of wind speeds where the turbine is operational with the most likely significant wave height hs and peak wave period tp the aims of this study are to quantify the dynamic response of a semi submersible wind turbine and the impact on the mooring system dynamics expand the comparison to different iec turbulence classes and non iec turbulence models such as the api model and analyse extreme and severe operating conditions as part of the design process in terms of the uls moreover we generate 30 different realizations of the wind time series under each environmental condition allowing us to obtain statistically reliable design tensions of mooring lines by applying a time domain method the present paper is meant to distinguish the contributions of waves and wind separately and to compare the different results that can be obtained by using standard methods from the industry to ultimately determine which wind field is most conservative under each environmental condition section 2 describes the 90 m depth offshore site off the northern coast of spain to which the case study refers and the representative operational conditions chosen presents the characteristics of the original 10 mw rwt supported by the rescaled deepcwind platform and introduces our in house numerical model oasis employed for aero hydro servo elastic simulations with the different turbulent patterns used to generate the wind inflow sections 3 and 4 present a discussion of the simulation results and conclusions respectively 2 methodology to investigate the effects of different wind turbulence models on the motions of a semi submersible floating wind turbine and on the mooring system dynamics the methodology described in fig 2 is proposed first long term extreme wind sea states are selected according to the met ocean hindcast data for the reference location second hydrodynamic and aerodynamic loads are simulated separately for each environmental load case on the one hand incoming irregular wave time series are reconstructed by means of a discrete fourier transform dft algorithm the wave amplitudes used in the dft algorithm are obtained from the jonswap spectrum which allows us to relate hs and tp to the wave energy distribution along the frequencies on the other hand full field turbulent wind inflows are generated by the stochastic simulator turbsim introduced in section 1 finally both dynamic loads are coupled using the in house code oasis to model the dynamic response of the rescaled semi submersible wind turbine for which the model has been previously calibrated the time series output analysed in this study will be the surge heave and pitch motions of the platform response as well as the tensions on the windward mooring lines 2 1 turbulence models the kaimal and von kármán iec turbulence models apply a vertical power law wind speed

determined experimentally by andersen and løvseth 2006 on the other hand the spectra of the kaimal model for the three wind components k u v w are given by 4 s k f 4 σ k 2 l k u h u b 1 6 f l k u h u

bimep has an open sea testing facility 2 km offshore of the coastal town of armintza northern spain that covers a total surface area of 5 2 km2 the left side of fig 3 shows the dimensions of the bimep site and the location of the wavescan buoy 2 8848 e 43 4682 n 80 m depth that collects the field met ocean data described in trl 2017 on the right the bathymetric map of the bimep site resulting from a survey conducted by acciona energía in september 2010 is presented with a high resolution of 1 m at depths ranging from 50 to 90 m fig 4 presents the mean met ocean conditions at the bimep site trl 2017 the wind speed increase on the left shows that winds blow generally from the west south and east with the winds from the west being the most frequent and strongest the average wind speed at 10 m above the surface is 5 86 m s and the weibull distribution offers the best adjustment the log normal type is the distribution that best adjusts to the significant wave height and the predominant regime of waves comes from the northwest as can be clearly seen in the significant wave height rose diagram on the right sea states are defined by combining met ocean hindcasts and instrumental data using statistical techniques wind and wave resource assessments at global regional and local scales require the use of numerical databases due to the coarse spatial resolution of instrumental measurements in this work the wind characteristics and wave spectral data are provided by the bimep wavescan buoy and by the anteia buoy respectively numerical databases provide long time series that allow the wind and wave performance to be characterized in the long term the data used in this research are derived from the reanalysis database in trl 2017 undisturbed mean wind speeds and directions such as the significant wave heights wave peak periods and prevailing wave directions for the period of 1985 2015 are provided with a resolution of 1 h met ocean hindcasts are used to assess the long term environmental conditions in a specific location the selection of severe sea states is based on the application of the inverse first order reliability method iform whose main target is to predict the long term met ocean conditions generating an environmental contour corresponding to a certain return period haver and winterstein 2008 del jesus et al 2015 thus to estimate the long term extreme sea states barrera et al 2019 applied the iform to a short term analysis and different return periods the extreme wind conditions 90 m above the surface and the wave conditions are characterized in fig 5 four load cases were selected on the contour line of the 50 year return period yellow line covering the range associated with the maximum peak wave period from the mean wind speed to the maximum significant wave height 2 3 definition of the semi submersible wind turbine the simulated platform is of the semi submersible type and it is a rescaled shape of the deepcwind platform described in robertson et al 2017 the platform has three exterior main columns which ensure the platform floatability and stability and a central column that supports the wind turbine fig 6 the exterior columns are distributed at the vertices of an equilateral triangle and the central column is at the barycentre the four columns are connected by means of bracings to ensure the structural integrity of the platform the rescaling process was performed to fit the dtu 10 mw rwt in the deepcwind platform while maintaining the dynamical properties of a floating wind turbine as realistically as possible thus during the rescaling process variables such as the platform restoring capacity seakeeping behaviour and operativity were checked to maintain them as realistically as possible the mooring system is composed of three lines each of which is attached to an exterior column the fairlead positions are at the base part of the exterior columns the mooring system was designed to cope with the requirements of the bimep site which has a depth of 90 m and to be compliant with the os e301 2018 standard the dtu 10 mw rwt controller was adapted to cope with the platform dynamics fig 7 the tuning procedure was carried out thanks to the oasys numerical model targeting the optimal compromise between the platform behaviour and turbine performance 2 4 model description the dynamic response of the fowt system has been simulated numerically with oasis the hydro aero servo elastic code developed at ihcantabria the fowt system is modelled based on a set of reference systems including a global system and several local references placed across the floating turbine structure the origin of the global reference frame is located at the centre of gravity cog of the fowt system with initial conditions the x axis is positive downwind aligned with the direction of wind and waves the z axis is positive upward and the y axis direction is given by the right hand rule oasis is a time domain metaphysics solver that is able to simulate wave load effects mooring systems and wind turbines wave load physics are represented in the model by means of the cummins equation so the added mass and damping coefficients come from a linear flow potential model that does not represent the viscosity effects to accurately simulate the platform displacements and rotations it is necessary to add viscosity effects in the present case viscosity effects have been added through a calibration of the model with the experimental campaign performed during the trl project the calibration procedure was performed using a decay test by adding a viscosity coefficient linear and nonlinear parts to fit the decay rate in each of the 6 degrees of freedom dofs fig 8 and fig 9 show the decay tests and results of the calibrated model respectively for the platform heave displacements and pitch rotations for each sea state of the 4 previously selected cases apart from the reference case with only wave loads we generate 7 full field turbulent winds related to three different turbulence models and different turbulence intensities for the kaimal and von kármán spectral models we simulate the three different turbulence classes to analyse the effect of the turbulence intensity class a designates the category for higher turbulence characteristics i u 0 16 class b designates the category for medium turbulence characteristics i u 0 14 and class c designates the category for lower turbulence characteristics i u 0 12 at u h u b 15 m s iec 61400 1 2005 the api model has a turbulence intensity of 0 08 for this mean wind speed at hub height table 1 summarizes the 32 cases considered in the present study for each environmental condition in the 28 cases considered with coupled wind and wave loads 30 different realizations of the inflow winds were generated using the stochastic full field turbulence simulator turbsim therefore it is possible to obtain statistically reliable design tension values of the mooring lines from each realization we obtained a set of maximum values that were statistically analysed according to the position mooring standards os e301 2018 these 844 simulations including the 4 reference cases were run in neptuno a high performance computing hpc cluster held by ihcantabria composed of 1276 cores its 5 tb of ram and 130 tb of disk space allow the computational manageability of a large number of simulations each simulated realization has a 3 h duration after the transient response with a temporal resolution of 0 05 s the yz cross plane grid has a height of 250 m a width of 250 m and a grid point matrix dimension of 32 32 note that in contrast to the iec models the velocity spectrum of the api model varies along the grid with height 3 results 3 1 motion response sensitivity of the semi submersible wind turbine to turbulence modelling this section aims to demonstrate the influence of turbulence models on platform motions the simulated displacements and rotations refer to the centre of mass of the semi submersible floating platform measured with respect to the global reference system fig 10 presents the power spectral responses of the heave displacements for the different wind turbulence models studied in each sea state the heave motion spectra of the floating platform with only wave loads as a reference are also depicted and there is no difference between the spectra with and without wind sea states hence we can conclude that the impact of wind turbulence on the heave displacement response of the floater is limited regardless of the mean wind speed the frequency domain analysis of the heave movement shows that all the energy of the heave motion is located within the range of the wave frequencies for the larger period sea states i e t p 21 60 s 0 046 h z t p 20 93 s 0 048 h z and t p 20 12 s 0 050 h z however for the shorter wave period t p 17 15 s 0 058 h z the energy peak appears around the heave natural frequency 0 052 hz as a result of the lock in phenomenon following the above analysis fig 11 shows the power spectral responses of the obtained surge displacements in this case there are energy peaks in two separate ranges of frequencies at high frequencies from 0 046 hz to 0 058 hz the surge response is not affected by the wind load and it depends only on the wave frequency of each sea state conversely at low frequencies the surge motions of the platform are dominated by the wind conditions clarifying the differences between the turbulence models used for every wind sea state the low frequency peak energy appears around the surge natural frequency 0 004 hz and it has a higher value as the turbulence intensity is increased from 0 08 api model to 0 16 iec models of class a at a mean wind speed of 5 83 m s the von kármán models have a larger energy content than the kaimal models and a much larger energy content than the api model we can use the zeroth order spectral moment to quantify the spectral energy density in the frequency domain from 0 to 0 012 hz where most of the wind information is located the m0 of the api model represents only 5 1 of that of the von kármán model with turbulence class a as u0 is increased the importance of the wind loads is reduced relative to that of the wave loads moreover the spectral analysis reveals that the low frequency kaimal power energy surpasses the von kármán power energy in agreement with fig 1 the higher dependence of turbulence given by the api model as the mean wind speed is increased is also demonstrated in fig 11 thus at u 0 17 94 m s and for the same low frequency domain from 0 to 0 012 hz the m0 of the api model represents 40 2 of that of the kaimal model with turbulence class a the power spectral responses of the pitch rotations are presented in fig 12 at higher mean wind velocities the response of the platform is approximately dominated by the pitch natural frequency 0 027 hz the higher the turbulence intensity is the higher the zeroth order spectral moment between 0 and 0 035 hz at u 0 17 94 m s and for this frequency domain the m0 of the api model represents 9 7 of that of the von kármán model with turbulence class a at lower u0 the wind turbine does not achieve the rated speed fig 7 and the platform pitch behaviour is affected only by wind fluctuations at frequencies one order of magnitude smaller note that the api model uses a vertical logarithmic wind speed profile instead of a power law profile as the iec models do which is the reason why the platform pitch motions for the api model are highly influenced by the proportional integral derivative pid blade pitch controller frequency from u 0 11 76 m s instead of 8 75 m s as in the iec models to better understand the differences between the turbulence models considered fig 12 presents magnified plots of the power spectral responses of the pitch rotations it is important to mention that as u0 is increased from 5 83 m s to 8 75 m s at wave frequencies the api power energy surpasses the power energy in all of the iec models increasing m0 between 0 035 and 0 080 hz from 64 7 to 126 1 of that of the von kármán model with turbulence class a statistical values of the heave top and surge displacements bottom left as well as the pitch rotations bottom right are shown in fig 13 as a function of u0 the mean heave motions of the floating platform as well as the minimum and maximum values are independent of the wind loads in agreement with the power spectral responses shown in fig 10 the highest mean and maximum values appear with the severe sea state h s 9 50 m and t p 20 12 s related to u 0 11 76 m s the same curve shape can be seen in the surge motions of the platform only with wave loads due to second order wave forces nevertheless with coupled wind and wave loads the gradients of the mean surge curves are dominated by the thrust force on the wind turbine and thus by the mean wind speed at hub height the api model surpasses the iec models at u 0 8 75 m s because its vertical logarithmic wind speed profile results in u hub 10 71 m s approaching the maximum thrust while the power law profile of the iec models reaches u hub 12 55 m s and is already on the back side of the thrust curve fig 7 the differences between the iec models are reflected in their maximum and minimum curves with the standard deviation increasing as the turbulence intensity is increased this is emphasized even more in the plots of the pitch rotations in this case although the mean values are dominated by the turbine thrust the extreme values are dependent on second order wave forces 3 2 impact on the mooring system dynamics in this section an analysis of the resulting mooring line tensions is presented the mooring lines are equispaced at 120 and connected to each floater of the triangular semi submersible platform mooring line 3 is aligned with the x axis of the global coordinate system on the leeward side of the floating wind platform while mooring lines 1 and 2 are on the windward side with a non zero component in the y direction and are oriented symmetrically with respect to the x direction the power spectra of the two windward mooring line tensions for the seven different wind turbulence models studied with the reference case having only wave loads are shown at the sea states related to u0 values of 5 83 m s and 8 75 m s in fig 14 at low mean wind speeds the windward mooring line tensions present two peaks of energy content and both are dominated by wind loads the range of low frequencies has a maximum power appearing around the surge natural frequency 0 004 hz and the peak in the other frequency range appears at the wave frequency of each sea state 0 046 hz and 0 048 hz at u 0 5 83 m s both maxima attain higher values as the turbulence intensity increases from 0 08 api model to 0 16 iec models of class a from 0 035 to 0 080 hz the m0 of the reference case with only wave loads represents only 3 5 of the von kármán model with turbulence class a as u0 is increased to 8 75 m s and the importance of low frequencies is reduced relative to that of wave frequencies the kaimal power energy at low frequencies surpasses the von kármán power energy at low frequencies and the difference from the api model is reduced moreover at wave frequencies the differences between the iec models are not clear and the api power energy surpasses the power energy in all the iec models increasing the m0 between 0 035 and 0 080 hz from 45 3 to approximately 160 of that of the von kármán model with turbulence class a fig 15 shows the power spectra of the two windward mooring line tensions at the sea states related to high mean wind speeds as u0 is increased from 8 75 m s to 11 76 m s and the severe sea state is reached fig 13 the relative importance of waves in terms of energy continues to grow however the m0 of the api model between 0 035 and 0 080 hz is reduced to approximately 130 of that of the von kármán model with turbulence class a since the differences in the turbine thrust decrease magnified plots in fig 12 for the same reason the relative m0 of the api model with respect to the von kármán model with a high turbulence intensity continues to decrease from 130 to 120 while the relative energy dominance of wave frequencies is reduced at the extremal sea state of hsmax with u 0 17 94 m s this energy peak no longer appears at a wave frequency but at the heave natural frequency 0 052 hz as a result of the lock in phenomenon the m0 of the reference case with only wave loads between 0 035 and 0 080 hz represents approximately 12 of that of the von kármán model with turbulence class a moreover there is a perceptible third energy peak dominated by wind loads at the pitch natural frequency 0 027 hz the statistical values of the tensions in the windward mooring lines as a function of u0 are shown in fig 16 the highest mean and maximum values of the reference case with only wave loads appear in the severe sea state related to u 0 11 76 m s due to second order wave forces conversely the curve gradients of the cases with coupled wind and wave loads are dominated by the turbine thrust hence the api model surpasses the iec models at u 0 8 75 m s and the difference between the iec models and the non iec model is reduced as the mean wind speed increases on the other hand the differences between the iec models are reflected in their maximum curves being more dependent on second order wave forces as the turbulence intensity is increased the design tension of a mooring line is estimated as the most probable maximum mpm value of the gumbel distribution for the line tension the mpm value of the gumbel distribution corresponds to the 37 percentile and is given by 12 mpm μ 0 45 σ where μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation of the maxima observed from each of the 30 simulations the gumbel distributions of the two windward mooring line tensions for the seven different wind turbulence models analysed are shown at low mean wind velocities in fig 17 the mpm values of these extreme value distributions for mooring line tensions are marked with dashed dotted lines the gumbel distributions of the extreme values corresponding to the first sea state at u 0 5 83 m s are highly dependent on the turbulence class in agreement with its negligible energy content at low velocities the api model presents the smallest standard deviation and the lowest mpm values for the iec models the higher the turbulence intensity is the higher the mpm value as u0 increases to 8 75 m s the mpm values of the api model surpass those of the iec models due to the thrust force of the wind turbine as the power content at wave frequencies rises in relative importance at this mean wind speed fig 14 the mpm values are not highly influenced by the turbulence intensity moreover the variability between the mpm values of the iec models in the two windward mooring lines is presented as a consequence of roll and yaw rotations induced by the wind turbine at the rated speed fig 18 shows the gumbel distributions of the two windward mooring line tensions at u0 values of 11 76 m s and 17 94 m s upon increasing the mean wind velocity the api model maintains the largest mpm values for the tensions of the windward mooring lines for the iec models the higher the turbulence intensity is the higher the standard deviation of the gumbel distributions for the mooring line tensions in agreement with fig 16 in summary we present the mpm values with the 5th and 95th percentile values of the gumbel distributions in fig 19 as a function of the mean wind speed at u 0 5 83 m s the mpm values are highly dependent on the turbulence intensity and those of the api model may be underestimated on the other hand the mooring dynamics are governed by the surge response of the platform but with non negligible contributions from heave and pitch motions hence the combination of turbine thrust and waves is decisive for the maximum thrust force figs 14 and 15 the design tensions of the windward mooring lines are defined at u 0 8 75 m s and a maximum value of at least 357 tm is obtained for the api model in addition in severe sea states with u 0 11 76 m s the 95th percentile values of the gumbel distributions for the kaimal models are clearly higher than those for the von kármán models 4 conclusions the dynamic response of a rescaled deepcwind platform supporting the dtu 10 mw rwt has been simulated numerically under different wind turbulence models with oasis the hydro aero servo elastic code developed by ihcantabria for each of the 4 load cases selected at the offshore site of the bimep area with a 50 year return period for wind and waves apart from the reference case with only wave loads we have generated 7 full field turbulent winds using turbsim kaimal and von kármán spectral models with three different turbulence classes each and the api turbulence model with the lowest turbulence intensity for the 28 cases analysed with coupled wind and wave loads we have run 30 different realizations of 3 h duration after the transient response with a temporal resolution of 0 05 s the following conclusions are drawn the heave displacements of the platform exhibit no dependence on wind loads the highest mean and maximum values appear with the severe sea state the mean values of surge motions are dominated by the thrust force and thus by the vertical wind speed profile the highest mean value is obtained with the api model at u 0 8 75 m s which is 9 9 larger than the value obtained with the iec models on the other hand the higher the turbulence intensity is the higher the standard deviations of the surge displacements at u 0 5 83 m s the gradients of the mean pitch curves are similar to those of the surge curves and the standard deviations also rise as the turbulence intensity increases however under this degree of freedom the highest standard deviation is obtained in the severe sea state at u 0 11 76 m s and for the same turbulence class the von kármán model presents larger variability than the kaimal model surge displacements dominate the mooring dynamics but with non negligible influences on heave and pitch motions the highest mean value of the windward mooring lines is obtained with the api model at u 0 8 75 m s and the api value is at least 18 7 larger than that obtained with the iec models on the other hand the higher the turbulence intensity is the higher the standard deviations of the windward mooring lines at u 0 5 83 m s the highest design tension of the windward mooring lines is obtained with the api model at u 0 8 75 m s at least 357 tm on the other hand the higher the turbulence intensity is the higher the design tension of the windward mooring lines at u 0 5 83 m s it is clear that a mooring system may not be designed without coupling wind loads to wave loads moreover the selection of the wind turbulence model is not trivial as the design tension of the windward mooring lines is highly dependent on the turbulence model used once the wind turbine has achieved the rated speed the api model may be used to remain on the conservative side conversely at lower u0 when the wind turbine has not yet achieved the rated speed iec models with turbulence class a may be used instead to achieve higher safety levels

target tracking for both aerial and underwater application scenario are classified based on the active and passive modes of target tracking these algorithms are analysed and compared in the form of mode tracking technology and respective validation algorithm available in the literature from this survey the future directions and major challenges are edged to obtain higher level of tracking performance keywords auv uav auav puav mtt 1 introduction in the current era of world autonomous target tracking has been observed one of most interested research fields and finds extensive range of applications such as civilian and military fields specifically in border patrolling convey protection underwater and aerial surveillance common names of unmanned aerial vehicle uav are drone unattended air system uas and remotely piloted aircraft rpa in general a uav is expressed as an aircraft without a human pilot nowadays autonomous underwater vehicles are getting more and further attention of researchers due to its wide range of potential applications in military industrial commercial and others tracking is a process in which the state i e position velocity and acceleration of single or multiple targets are estimated instantly in close to the true actual state as possible through the measurements available from various sensors it is very demanding especially in the military services war environment for two major causes first aim is to avoid from being attacked by others and the second aim is to strike the attacker as soon as possible the accuracy of collected information can directly affect the success or failure of a mission in some matter luo et al 2018 the autonomous behaviour of the target tracking system in aerial underwater and ground applications is possible with the utilization of artificial intelligence positional information collection and environmental understanding hence the autonomy is similar to the human cognizance since it can be divided into two sub problems like ecological understanding or observation and evolutionary learning system shit 2020 the tracking of ship acquires some additional challenges raised by complicated back ground clutter false alarm than air surveillance the wave or wake generated by the ship also needs to take into account that causes more complexity than conventional ship tracking the common examples of ship tracking include tracking a littoral combat ship a recreational vessel or a fishing boat with radar or sonar sensors li et al 2020 a considerable number of reviews on target tracking has been reported

underwater targets tracking systems for a thorough correlation of the algorithms used for aerial and underwater target tracking system a survey on combining these two applications is needed this review work provides recent development in tracking technology for aerial and underwater applications simultaneously this review is carried out on the basis of modes of target tracking target motion model tracking technology and respective validation approach this paper aims on a review of target tracking problems specifically in aerial and underwater applications remaining parts of the paper are summarized as follows in section 2 the theory of target tracking is presented briefly target tracking based on image video information processing is presented in section 3 in section 4 the target

target tracking used for auvs uavs are summarized section 7 presents the discussion challenges and future prospects of target tracking finally the conclusions are made in section 8 2 theory of target tracking target tracking refers to the method in which information received from the measurement sensor is employed to achieve an estimation of current state of single or multiple targets the state of target mainly describes the position velocity and additional kinematic components the measurements information collected generally includes target information slope direct distance estimation direction of arrival doa indication of signal strength received issr time of arrival toa or time difference of arrival tdoa and doppler frequency shift caused by the frequency difference between sensors when sensors detect the existence of the target the observation information are often achieved by sampling the sensed signals e g light sound image or video then the position of the target is often computed mathematically by relating this information to the target state finally the tracking process is completed by determining the position of the target at each step an additional component of the filtering process is incorporated to improve the tracking accuracy due to the presence of measurement noise in order to predict the target location position corresponding to the target motion model filtering algorithms are often used to advance the rate of monitoring there are some common key components in the target tracking process such as target detection position determination target model construction and state filtering and prediction luo et al 2018 2 1 target detection target detection for visual tracking involves assessing the presence of the moving target in the image orders and relating the target attributes such as target position size of the external rectangle of the target the target identification is much simpler in non visual tracking an acoustic sensor is used to detect the target on receiving the signal strength more than a predefined threshold 2 2 position determination for visual tracking position determination point out the location of target area in each frame once a target is identified perfectly then adjacent frame is evaluated while in case of non visual tracking the target position is determined by sensors used for detection of location the distance between these sensors and the target results in the determination of the position with active sensors this information can be easily accessed 2 3 target model construction generally target tracking problems are described on the basis of two models one is dynamic motion model used to represent the target behaviour and other is used to observe the target termed as observation model the pre requisite condition of target tracking is the establishment of target dynamic motion model and observation model these models can be together called as state space model the observer and target geometry for the target motion analysis are shown in fig 1 also the measurement angles for the bearing only tracking problem in cartesian coordinate system are shown in fig 2 there are different types of target motion model for uavs and auvs available in the literature the most common types of target motion dynamic models are constant velocity cv constant turn ct and constant acceleration ca models the mathematical description for each target motion model in two dimensional coordinate system is presented here a mathematical model may have different structures based on the target motion model depending on different dynamic and constraints of required problem for more details on mathematical model of motion model in three dimensional coordinate system one can refer the literature you et al 2016 2 3 1 constant velocity model cv model the state equation is the assumptions about the target motion laws for example suppose that the target moves in a straight line with a constant velocity in a two dimensional plane then in the discrete time system the target states x k y k at time t k can be denoted as 1 x k x 0 v x t k x 0 v x k t 2 y k y 0 v y t k y 0 v y k t where x 0 y 0 is the target location at the initial moment v x and v y are the velocity along the x axis and the y axis respectively and t is the sampling interval in the recursive form equation 1 and equation 2 can be written as 3 x k 1 x k v x t x k x k t 4 y k 1 y k v y t y k y k t it is impossible to attain an accurate model of targets moving with constant velocity due to presence of unpredictable events or activity there may be always a fluctuation in target velocity or presence of surrounding noises or disturbances to overcome this fluctuation in velocity of target process noise is introduced with target motion dynamics model which can be described as 5 x k 1 x k x k t 1 2 v x t 2 6 y k 1 y k y k t 1 2 v y t 2 also the target velocity can be described as 7 x k 1 x k v x t 8 y k 1 y k v y t in the constant velocity models the state vector x k is used to describe the system s dynamic features as x k x k y k x k y k t in the matrix form the target state equation is expressed from equation 2 5 2 8 as 9 x k 1 y k 1 x k 1 y k 1 1 0 t 0 0 1 0 t 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 x k y k x k y k 0 5 t 2 0 0 0 5 t 2 t 0 0 t v x v y 10 also x k 1 f k x k γ k v k where f k is state transition matrix and v k is the process noise vector 2 3 2 constant acceleration model ca model here the target travels with a constant acceleration along a straight line in a two dimensional plane considering the random changes in velocity the location and velocity can be expressed in recursive form as 11 x k 1 x k x k t 1 2 x k t 2 1 2 v x t 2 12 y k 1 y k y k t 1 2 y k t 2 1 2 v y t 2 13 x k 1 x k t x k t v x t 14 y k 1 y k t y k t v y t 15 x k 1 x k v x 16 y k 1 y k v y for constant acceleration model the state vector of target motion is x k x k x k x k y k y k y k t and the process noise vector is v k v x v y t the state transition matrix and process noise distribution matrix of target motion models are expressed as 17 f k 1 t 0 5 t 2 0 0 0 0 1 t 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 t 0 5 t 2 0 0 0 0 1 t 0 0 0 0 0 1 18 γ k 0 5 t 2 0 t 0 1 0 0 0 5 t 2 0 t 0 1 2 3 3 coordinate turn model ct model in this model target is turning continuously along a specific path and the state transition matrix is incorporated with an additional quantity called as turning rate parameter from the fig 3 shown above one can write 19 v x v cos ϕ and v y v sin ϕ 20 owing to the fact that ω d ϕ d t 21 also d d t v x v sin ϕ d ϕ d t v y ω 22 d d t v y v cos ϕ d ϕ d t v x ω combining all the above equations in the matrix form one obtains x t x t y t y t 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 ω t 0 0 0 1 0 ω t 0 0 x t x t y t y t v t 23 where v t is the process noise usually assumed to be gaussian noise after discrete treatment and laplace transformation of the above equation the system state transition matrix of the coordinate turn model when the rate of turn ω is known can be given as f k 1 sin ω t ω 0 cos ω t 1 ω 0 cos ω t 0 sin ω t 0 1 cos ω t ω 1 sin ω t ω 0 sin ω t 0 cos ω t 24 when the rate of turn is not known accurately the standard ct model should be extended to have an additional element ω in the state vector that is f k 1 sin ω t ω 0 cos ω t 1 ω 0 0 cos ω t 0 sin ω t 0 0 1 cos ω t ω 1 sin ω t ω 0 0 sin ω t 0 cos ω t 0 0 0 0 0 1 25 now the corresponding process noise distribution matrix is written as γ k 0 5 t 2 t 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 t 2 t 0 0 0 0 0 1 26 2 4 state filtering and estimation target tracking problem is typically deal with uncertainties these uncertainties mainly arise from uncertainty inherent with target motion termed as process noise and uncertainty with measurement observation model represented as measurement noise this uncertainty may also arise from the false noise occurred by multiple targets and due to cluttered surrounding hence filtering techniques are tools for estimation and prediction of target state to exclude the uncertainties allied with the target it is necessary to choose an appropriate filtering algorithm or to adjust the current algorithm on the basis of a well established dynamic motion model and observation model to satisfy the specific requirement of the target tracking system estimation theory requires the establishment of a system model describing the dynamic characteristics of the target and measurement processes a valuable method of describing the system model the state variable method is created on the system state equation and the observation equation according to this method the state variable system state equation system observation equation system noise and observation noise system input and output i e the estimated value of the state variable are the five essential elements of the target tracking system modelling the five elements above imitate the basic features of a system and can be viewed as a complete expression of a dynamic system the state variable at any given time is stated as a function of the state variable prior to that time the input and output relationship of the system is described by the state transition model and the output observation model in the time domain the state reflects the system s interior condition the input can be described by the state equation which is composed of the decided time function and the arbitrary process on behalf of the unpredictable variable or noise the output is a function of the state vector typically anxious by the arbitrary observation error and can be described by measurement equations in the system modelling process the use of the system state equation and the observation equation in the description of the dynamic characteristics of the target is therefore the most successful method the relation between the state model and the measurement model is shown in fig 4 3 target tracking based on image video information processing video tracking has various applications like video surveillance intelligent transportation human and object tracking and identification video games robotics traffic flow measurement industrial automation protective systems biometric medical diagnosis human computer interaction and public safety target tracking strategies differ depending on purpose of being used the majority of moving target tracking strategies can be monitored from one frame to the next in a series of images moghaddam and yarifard 2016 the purpose of visual target tracking is for precise location identification and tracking of target from images received from the collector continuously in terms of simplicity high quality security reliability high cost performance and low energy consumption visual target tracking technology has a specific social application value a video sequence may have a set of features that are influenced by the shooting situations and the frequency of each feature varies some common attributes of video sequence are aspect ratio

sob and viewpoint change vc jia et al 2020 visual tracking can be reflected as an substitute method for conventional recognition identification and tracking methods like radars fiyad et al 2020 vision based object tracking is a three stage video analysis procedure in which the first stage is associated with moving object identification the second with object recognition and the final stage is associated with object tracking in a specific picture the method of deciding the existence and attributes of an object is known as object classification the object tracking method then monitors the motion parameters of the specified object such as location velocity and acceleration the basic steps of object tracking process used in vision based tracking are shown in fig 5 tiwari and singhai 2017 for the object identification or detection in the visual target tracking several techniques such as background subtraction bs optical flow of temporal frame difference tfd and supervised learning sl techniques can be implemented the different methods for object detection are presented in fig 6 one of the most important detection methods for efficient visual monitoring is background subtraction the video frame s content is divided into two parts foreground and background the foreground is dealing with moving objects like cars and people while the background is associated with static images that do not move from one frame to another as the background shifts over time background subtraction suffers from performance degradation so the temporal frame difference strategy is used as the system camera is shifting optical flow is a method for locating moving objects in video frames that is widely used optical flow offers information regarding object orientation and displacement in the form of vectors due to its higher detection accuracy it produces a two dimensional vector field also known as a motion field which is better for multi objective moving interpretation in complex scenes with a dynamic background supervised learning is a technique for training a classifier to distinguish between various object views following training a decision is made whether the detected object is a target or not based on the specified area to identify goals supervised learning algorithms like decision trees support vector machines boosting and neural networks are used in kwan and budavari 2020 for object detection three well known methods of optical flow are investigated for tracking execution in low feature and long range infrared videos of small moving targets these three methods of extracting motion information in the videos or image sequence are lucas kanade lk algorithm total variance with l1 restriction tv l1 and high accuracy optical flow measurement using a warping theory brox in order to be accurate for target detection optical flow methods must be coupled with contrast improvement connected component analysis and target affiliation binocular stereo vision uses two cameras instead of using human eyes for measurement and judgment with the same specifications such as the same focal length sensor area and aperture the fundamental concept of binocular vision ranging is to use two left and right cameras to record the image of the measured object at the same time the object being measured is different as the positions of different camera vary screens this variation in location is referred to as disparity the disparity theory is used to gain three dimensional knowledge about the object the binocular stereo vision ranging system is suitable for non contact

neighborhood matching method fcnmm to achieve exact target positions to enhance the tracking performance a fusion correction mechanism fcm is combined with the kernelized correlation filter kcf tracking algorithm despite the fact that kcf has a strong theoretical basis and excellent experimental results in reality inaccurate tracking and lack of judgment of tracking failure would happen eventually in the case of complete occlusion the conventional kcf fails to monitor the targets correctly to improve kcf tracking efficiency a fusion correction mechanism fcm has been developed in cui et al 2020 the summary of fcm based kcf algorithm is presented in table 1 and for more details interested readers can refer the literature listed in the above references in gao et al 2021 a feature

cross correlation zncc are compared the results revealed that zncc is the most effective in detecting the target and that pid control is roughly 30 more accurate than p control 4 classification of target tracking based on mode of tracking on the basis of mode of tracking sensors target tracking system can be grouped into two categories namely passive and active target tracking in the passive target tracking only the target state can be assessed by emitted signal from the target it has only the receiver to obtain the signals emitted from the target in case of active tracking the additional information of range can be achieved by toa or tdoa since echoes produced by the tracker are reflected by the target in the simple meaning active target tracking has both transmitters and receivers 4 1 passive target tracking the passive target tracking problem can be described as bearing only tracking bot in which the target state is determined solely by measurements received from the target signals due to the intrinsic nonlinearity between the target state and the passive measurements the design and development of the bot algorithm for reliable and robust situations is still a challenging problem in both theoretical and real world aspects for applications like air traffic control underwater surveillance and ground based acoustic sensor surveillance the angle only target tracking problems have been widely employed in such problems the target motion parameters are estimated form noise corrupted measurement of target angle su et al 2020 4 2 active target tracking active target tracking aims at assessing the target state on the base of bearing and range data delivered by the target echoes and the echoes are generated within the system itself hence there are transmitters and receivers in the active tracking system nevertheless due to concealment tracking systems consisting of active sources have low control efficiency in anti submarine warfare asw because of the existing range data produced by the active measurements the target position can also be easily obtained hence the target tracking algorithm on the basis of active measurement is an interesting research centre for applications for underwater target tracking the sensor used for measurement purpose in the application of aerial underwater tracking or mobile robotics can be classified into two categories namely proprioceptive sensors and exteroceptive sensors condomines 2018 proprioceptive sensors are being used to assess the vehicle s movement across space based upon the information that is interpreted locally e g acceleration measurements this yields the results that are simple to exploit and independent of environmental factors which are important in autonomous uav navigation proprioceptive sensors include the gyroscope and accelerometer exteroceptive sensors gather data about the vehicle s surroundings pressure magnetic field etc this dataset contains information of observations about an absolute reference frame attached to the environment e g satellite position these sensors provide useful data that might be used to reconfigure the localization collected by using proprioceptive sensors to monitor the vehicle s motion on a regular basis the common examples of exteroceptive sensors are satellite positioning systems barometric altimeters magnetometers cameras and telemeters sonar lidar inertial measurement units imu inertial navigation systems ins and attitude and heading reference systems ahrs the majority of active remote systems employed in remote sensing activities work in the microwave range of the electromagnetic spectrum that allows it to spread across the atmosphere in most situations laser altimeter scatterometer lidar radar ranging instrument and sounder are examples of active remote sensing systems lidar and radar are two popular active sensors used in remote sensing the sensor detects natural radiation that is generated or reflected by the target in a passive remote sensing system most of the passive sensors work in visible thermal infrared infrared and microwave segments of the electromagnetic spectrum accelerometer imaging radiometer hyperspectral radiometer radiometer spectrometer sounder and spectroradiometer are examples of passive remote sensing devices the spectrometer is a popular passive sensor used in remote sensing the spectral content of incident electromagnetic radiation is detected measured and analysed by a spectrometer sensor shakhatreh et al 2019 5 classification of target tracking based on application target tracking can be classified in many ways which have been presented in many literatures here based on applications target tracking is classified into two categories namely unmanned aerial tracking and unmanned underwater tracking the development of mathematical modelling of uavs and auvs is almost similar in nature there is a difference in drag and lift force consideration as it is neglected in the modelling of underwater vehicles due to its slow speed the major differences are in navigation and communication of uavs and auvs most of the aerial systems rely on radio wave or spectrum based communication incorporated with global positioning system gps while underwater systems use acoustic based sensors for the communication since it is impossible to travel the radio waves too far inside the water and as auv system dives in the water gets disconnected with gps signals dead reckoning is a standard way to navigate auvs in underwater however by implementing an acoustic based positioning system like usbl and imu navigation can be improved the localization navigation and communication of auvs are major challenges due to absence of gps and radio wave communication in gonzález garcía et al 2020 different alternative methods such as inertial dead reckoning acoustic geophysical and optical based technologies are comprehensively presented with relative drawbacks and advantages inertial based navigation system can be accepted for long range mission for the accuracy needed in tens or hundreds of meters while for small range mission accuracy needed in millimetres or centimetres an sbl usbl system operating at a frequency of 200 khz can be accepted a hybrid navigation comprised of acoustic light and or vision based system is an encouraging preference for the communication of collaborative auvs 5 1 unmanned aerial tracking with the advancement and growth in technology uavs are finding wide range of applications and gaining the popularity among the people in research and industry earlier uavs were used in defence application only but due to people s awareness and technological advancement now uavs find vast range of applications such as surveillance smart farming and agriculture environment monitoring building structure photogrammetry rescue operation in disaster management civil security video capturing and filming and surveying wildfire tracking cloud monitoring delivering goods and power line inspection cabreira et al 2019 nadir et al 2019 alladi et al 2020 the uavs are aerial platforms that do not have pilots on board a human control such platforms remotely and manually but they also operate automated pre programmed flights intelligent systems with on board sensors can be used to operate the autonomous flights cabreira et al 2019 in mohamed et al 2018 potential applications of uavs in smart cities like health emergency services uav based infrastructure inspection security and crowd monitoring agriculture management and monitoring traffic monitoring and management tourism support etc are reviewed many such problems in smart cities can be handled by integrating uavs to obtain intelligent and cost effective solutions uavs can now carry out complex and dangerous missions without the need of human interference with the integration of sensors and cameras this is accomplished with high productivity and speed while keeping costs down nadir et al 2019 in kumar et al 2021 by investigating the types of sensors suitable for smart farming and agriculture the design adaptation and use of uavs have been presented the possibilities and challenges of using uavs in smart farming are investigated it has been concluded that the use of uavs and associated technologies has made a significant contribution to the enhancement and optimization of various agricultural processes uavs have an effect on the cultivation process by conducting efficient monitoring and spraying operations allowing pesticides and fertilisers to work to their full potential 5 1 1 principal components of uav aerial vehicles are composite systems consist of hardware and software arrangements the technological advancement permitted the growth of navigation and control systems more progressively available for the required applications the key components of an uav can be distributed into three main groups i aerial platform includes the airframe power system navigation system and the payload ii ground control station gcs can be autonomous or human operated and iii communication system to ensure communication and data links between the uav and the ground station giordan et al 2020 5 1 2 uav classification there are several factors to consider while classifying the uavs like fuselage rotary fixed flapping wings flying mechanism weight flying altitude wing type endurance mean take off weight mtow flying mode lighter heavier than air and mission or application hence there is no unique classification acknowledged in the literature nadir et al 2019 according to flight mechanism uavs can be classified into different group such as fixed wing rotary wing or multi rotor and hybrid wing alladi et al 2020 fixed wing uavs like commercial aeroplanes can glide through the atmosphere and carry large payloads the rotary wing provides manoeuvrability benefits a hybrid fixed rotary wing uav is a balance between the two mechanisms combining the benefits of both fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft allowing for vtol high speed flight and longer flight times uavs can be also categorized into two kinds namely low altitude platform lap and high altitude platform hap based on the altitude at that they are intended to operate cabreira et al 2019 because of their great mobility and cost effectiveness lap styled uavs is ideal for fast and versatile deployment hap styled uavs have the ability to reach a wider range of areas in a single flight due to their massive size and long endurance mtow is a good metric to classify the uavs for the regulatory purpose since it associates well with the estimated kinetic energy reported at impact which in turn is reflected to be primary factor affecting the security of actions on the base of mtow and ground impact risk uavs can be classified as micro mini small light ultra light normal and large dalamagkidis 2015 control strategy associated with unmanned vehicles is an important factor to decide the level of autonomy level and reliability of the system a simple classification of uavs on the basis of level of human involvement in required operation or autonomy can be divided into three types as remotely piloted semi autonomous and fully autonomous control strategies sharma and subudhi 2019 in remote control strategy vehicles installed with autopilot are capable to strongly perform the control command nevertheless there is a deficiency of decision making or planning system implicating the vehicle is directed by human operators while in semi autonomous control strategy a higher level of control strategy than the remote control the vehicles are not only fitted out with autopilot but also with decision making but only modest missions can be autonomously completed by the vehicles and there is a necessity of human operator particularly during challenging circumstances fully autonomous control strategy has the highest control strategy among all the vehicle is capable to entirely autonomously perform all types of missions under most circumstances without any interference from human operators the autonomy level versus the system reliability or robustness is compared for three different control strategies as shown in fig 8 due to involvement of human operator the remote control strategy has lowest autonomy level and highest system reliability while there is highest autonomy level for the fully autonomous control strategy by scarifying the system robustness or reliability semi autonomous control strategy has compromised autonomy level and system reliability moreover advanced sensor suites intelligent decision making algorithm artificial intelligence technology and efficient data transmission channel are in high demand for the fully autonomous control to complete the mission satisfactorily in the fields of unmanned aerial tracking a lot of research work have been presented in the different prospective here the most significant and recent progress in development of target tracking algorithms are discussed the passive bearing only sensor has been extensively implemented in relative navigation missions such as uav formation flight optical navigation for interplanetary missions and visual navigation due to its weight and cost constraints chu et al 2020 for multiple pursuers a

gaussian and non gaussian noise scenarios is presented for target tracking marata et al 2019 the output of exponential and logistic distributed noise is analysed and simulation results are correlated with kalman filter and maximum a posteriori map based results the use of variational bayesian vb and consensus based filters for simultaneous target tracking and sensor location refinement in distributed targets with sensor position uncertainty is discussed in shen et al 2018 the target state and local sensor location are jointly estimated using the variational bayesian method while the consistent global target state can be approached using a consensus scheme at each node the filter for linear measurement models is first derived and then the ekf paradigm is used to extend it to

applications due to its operational cost and risk free operation these unmanned systems can be used in extremely hazardous and at the terrific depth unmanned water tracking systems are categorized into two groups such as autonomous underwater vehicle auv and remotely operated underwater vehicle rov rov are controlled from the surface connected through wired and perform variety of assignments but wired connection of rov confines its manoeuvrability and accessibility as well auvs automatically navigate relying on navigation technology and information from environment it has high manoeuvrability and accessibility since absence of wire connection auvs can travel to remote areas with complicated paths no human risk and reduced operating costs auvs are very popular among researchers for underwater applications due to the disadvantage of underwater wired communication it is a burdensome work to classify the applications of underwater vehicles in different groups and subgroups however some literatures are available on the classification of auvs based on applications such as military scientific industrial and other uses fig 9 presents some applications of auvs

the efficiency of the proposed controller for underwater vehicles applications 6 2 recursive method these methods perform better than batch processing methods and produce unbiased estimates of target state sequential bayesian filtering is one of the most popular and powerful recursive techniques to deal with wide range of state estimation problems kalman filter kf is the most common recursive filter used for estimation of linear problems since target tracking is the nonlinear problem due to presence of nonlinearity in the measurement term extended kalman filter is the commonly used recursive filter in nonlinear applications but ekf generally yields estimations with unknown bias and quadratic errors and required linear approximation of nonlinearity there are various modification and extension of kf in the literature the most common recursive techniques for the nonlinear estimation are ekf ukf pf shifted rayleigh filter srf cubature kalman filter ckf srukf interactive multiple

7 challenges and future directions in this work the possible applications of autonomous vehicle in underwater and aerial target tracking scenario are discussed to enhance the tracking performance of the unmanned autonomous target tracking following improvements such as improvement in the detection algorithms feasibility and flexibility to specific task improvement in navigation system globally integrated framework of safety regulatory three dimensional robust and adaptive tracking algorithms on board computerised tracking controller are needed there are many works on experimental study presented in the literature but still there is a lot of scope for experimental investigation on autonomous target tracking to depict the real tracking scenario there are several studies reported for unmanned vehicles regarding the progress of autonomous system that works without any human intervention the autonomous system of any unmanned vehicles should be capable of decision making to react the tasks or activities without the help of human directly the on board image handling and ability of in filed analysis can be provided by the next generation of uav sensor that can result in ease and efficient tracking performance the limited power availability and payload of unmanned vehicles restricts the on board sensor needed for operation vision based uavs system has huge potential applications for detection and control in agriculture civil infrastructure traffic monitoring surveying for different aspects and etc the efficiency and accuracy of vision based autonomous system can be enhanced by image processing algorithms either by improving the image detection to ease of human or identifying the image themselves although vision based tracking methods required high computational operation for the handling of images these are still used in collision avoidance the camera and optical sensors used in vision based tracking need sufficient light to function properly presence of steam and or smoke could result in performance deficiency in order to improve the collision avoidance uavs could be incorporated with infrared and or ultrasonic sensors laser range finder and vision sensors the collision avoidance algorithm of multi uav system must be performed quickly due to high speed of uavs that is challenge for the researchers an unmanned vehicle should have three dimensional optimal path planning and obstacle avoidance to show the real behaviour but most of the auvs and uavs are modelled in two dimensions for the sake of simplicity and avoiding burden of computational load more researches need to be carried out considering three dimensions for path planning and selection of trajectory for the long range mission and fully automated unmanned vehicles sensor improvement high speed communication computer vision adaptive control and on board computer based tracking algorithms can be explored in the future in harmful underwater environments auvs have a huge number of applications in order to have a large scale adoption and reliable fully autonomous system these have to overcome some constraints low cost long lasting batteries underwater wireless communication advanced manufacturing techniques intelligent materials compact on board computers with high computing power and on board energy generation for better decision making are some of the key challenges in order to efficient tracking system these are some limitations that need to overcome in order to have full autonomous system reliable on large scale adoption the design of powerful on board processor with less consumption of power is still an interesting and active scope of researches most of the compact small scale auvs are bio mimetic in nature these bio mimetic auvs are quiet in operation and generally used in monitoring and survey applications the auvs can be equipped with more bio mimetic components to rise the efficiency in future for the better localization of target in the underwater surroundings of small scale auvs many innovative navigation methods have been presented for short range mission in literature it is difficult to decide the type of localization or navigation system best suited for underwater mission because of variation in mission with its own challenges and limitations auvs have to use the auxiliary surface to use gps for long term mission leads to its dependency on communication network to overcome this auvs can be equipped with more accurate and robust navigation methods in future the test beds are being currently used for the simulation of uavs and auvs need to be more mature and should be capable of handling the cyber attack to provide cyber security different filtering techniques have been presented in the literature for auv uav applications considering different aspects the success rate of filtering technique is identified by its minimum number of failures in estimation process during a certain number of operations but there is no such estimation technique which gives hundred percent of success rate in estimation hence there is a lot of research scope for developing new filtering technique to provide the more success rate also reducing the computational burden of the estimation techniques is a challenge for researchers in order to enhance the tracking performance most of the underwater tracking systems depend on the tethering networks such as lan and fibre optics cables for communication these cables also provide the hydrodynamic instability to the tracking vehicles and increase the drag the major limitations of these cables are manoeuvrability and accessibility wireless underwater communication is still a major challenge with high speed and high volume data 8 conclusions this paper gives the

performance keywords auv uav auav puav mtt 1 introduction in the current era of world autonomous target tracking has been observed one of most interested research fields and finds extensive range of applications such as civilian and military fields specifically in border patrolling convey protection underwater and aerial surveillance common names of unmanned aerial vehicle uav are drone unattended air system uas and remotely piloted aircraft rpa in general a uav is expressed as an aircraft without a human pilot nowadays autonomous underwater vehicles are getting more and further attention of researchers due to its wide range of potential applications in military industrial commercial and others tracking is a process in which the state i e position velocity and acceleration of single or multiple targets are estimated instantly in close to the true actual state as possible through the measurements available from various sensors it is very demanding especially in the military services war environment for two major causes first aim is to avoid from being attacked by others and the second aim is to strike the attacker as soon as possible the accuracy of collected information can directly affect the success or failure of a mission in some matter luo et al 2018 the autonomous behaviour of the target tracking system in aerial underwater and ground applications is possible with the utilization of artificial intelligence positional information collection and environmental understanding hence the autonomy is similar to the human cognizance since it can be divided into two sub problems like ecological understanding or observation and evolutionary learning system shit 2020 the tracking of ship acquires some additional challenges raised by complicated back ground clutter false alarm than air surveillance the wave or wake generated by the ship also needs to take into account that causes more complexity than conventional ship tracking the common examples of ship tracking include tracking a littoral combat ship a recreational vessel or a fishing boat with radar or sonar sensors li et al 2020 a considerable number of reviews on target tracking has been reported for aerial and underwater applications individually but a review combining these two applications has not been presented in the literature many researchers and scholars have studied aerial and underwater targets tracking systems for a thorough correlation of the algorithms used for aerial and underwater target tracking system a survey on combining these two applications is needed this review work provides recent development in tracking technology for aerial and underwater applications simultaneously this review is carried out on the basis of modes of target tracking target motion model tracking technology and respective validation approach this paper aims on a review of target tracking problems specifically in aerial and underwater applications remaining parts of the paper are summarized as follows in section 2 the theory of target tracking is presented briefly target tracking based on image video information processing is presented in section 3 in section 4 the target tracking problem is classified on the basis of tracking mode the classification based on application of target tracking is presented in section 5 in section 6 the different state filtering methods of target tracking used for auvs uavs are summarized section 7 presents the discussion challenges and future prospects of target tracking finally the conclusions are made in section 8 2 theory of target tracking target tracking refers to the method in which information received from the measurement sensor is employed to achieve an estimation of current state of single or multiple targets the state of target mainly describes the position velocity and additional kinematic components the measurements information collected generally includes target information slope direct distance estimation direction of arrival doa indication of signal strength received issr time of arrival toa or time difference of arrival tdoa and doppler frequency shift caused by the frequency difference between sensors when sensors detect the existence of the target the observation information are often achieved by sampling the sensed signals e g light sound image or video then the position of the target is often computed mathematically by relating this information to the target state finally the tracking process is completed by determining the position of the target at each step an additional component of the filtering process is incorporated to improve the tracking accuracy due to the presence of measurement noise in order to predict the target location position corresponding to the target motion model filtering algorithms are often used to advance the rate of monitoring there are some common key components in the target tracking process such as target detection position determination target model construction and state filtering and prediction luo et al 2018 2 1 target detection target detection for visual tracking involves assessing the presence of the moving target in the image orders and relating the target attributes such as target position size of the external rectangle of the target the target identification is much simpler in non visual tracking an acoustic sensor is used to detect the target on receiving the signal strength more than a predefined threshold 2 2 position determination for visual tracking position determination point out the location of target area in each frame once a target is identified perfectly then adjacent frame is evaluated while in case of non visual tracking the target position is determined by sensors used for detection of location the distance between these sensors and the target results in the determination of the position with active sensors this information can be easily accessed 2 3 target model construction generally target tracking problems are described on the basis of two models one is dynamic motion model used to represent the target behaviour and other is used to observe the target termed as observation model the pre requisite condition of target tracking is the establishment of target dynamic motion model and observation model these models can be together called as state space model the observer and target geometry for the target motion analysis are shown in fig 1 also the measurement angles for the bearing only tracking problem in cartesian coordinate system are shown in fig 2 there are different types of target motion model for uavs and auvs available in the literature the most common types of target motion dynamic models are constant velocity cv constant turn ct and constant acceleration ca models the mathematical description for each target motion model in two dimensional coordinate system is presented here a mathematical model may have different structures based on the target motion model depending on different dynamic and constraints of required problem for more details on mathematical model of motion model in three dimensional coordinate system one can refer the literature you et al 2016 2 3 1 constant velocity model cv model the state equation is the assumptions about the target motion laws for example suppose that the target moves in a straight line with a constant velocity in a two dimensional plane then in the discrete time system the target states x k y k at time t k can be denoted as 1 x k x 0 v x t k x 0 v x k t 2 y k y 0 v y t k y 0 v y k t where x 0 y 0 is the target location at the initial moment v x and v y are the velocity along the x axis and the y axis respectively and t is the sampling interval in the recursive form equation 1 and equation 2 can be written as 3 x k 1 x k v x t x k x k t 4 y k 1 y k v y t y k y k t it is impossible to attain an accurate model of targets moving with constant velocity due to presence of unpredictable events or activity there may be always a fluctuation in target velocity or presence of surrounding noises or disturbances to overcome this fluctuation in velocity of target process noise is introduced with target motion dynamics model which can be described as 5 x k 1 x k x k t 1 2 v x t 2 6 y k 1 y k y k t 1 2 v y t 2 also the target velocity can be described as 7 x k 1 x k v x t 8 y k 1 y k v y t in the constant velocity models the state vector x k is used to describe the system s dynamic features as x k x k y k x k y k t in the matrix form the target state equation is expressed from equation 2 5 2 8 as 9 x k 1 y k 1 x k 1 y k 1 1 0 t 0 0 1 0 t 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 x k y k x k y k 0 5 t 2 0 0 0 5 t 2 t 0 0 t v x v y 10 also x k 1 f k x k γ k v k where f k is state transition matrix and v k is the process noise vector 2 3 2 constant acceleration model ca model here the target travels with a constant acceleration along a straight line in a two dimensional plane considering the random changes in velocity the location and velocity can be expressed in recursive form as 11 x k 1 x k x k t 1 2 x k t 2 1 2 v x t 2 12 y k 1 y k y k t 1 2 y k t 2 1 2 v y t 2 13 x k 1 x k t x k t v x t 14 y k 1 y k t y k t v y t 15 x k 1 x k v x 16 y k 1 y k v y for constant acceleration model the state vector of target motion is x k x k x k x k y k y k y k t and the process noise vector is v k v x v y t the state transition matrix and process noise distribution matrix of target motion models are expressed as 17 f k 1 t 0 5 t 2 0 0 0 0 1 t 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 t 0 5 t 2 0 0 0 0 1 t 0 0 0 0 0 1 18 γ k 0 5 t 2 0 t 0 1 0 0 0 5 t 2 0 t 0 1 2 3 3 coordinate turn model ct model in this model target is turning continuously along a specific path and the state transition matrix is incorporated with an additional quantity called as turning rate parameter from the fig 3 shown above one can write 19 v x v cos ϕ and v y v sin ϕ 20 owing to the fact that ω d ϕ d t 21 also d d t v x v sin ϕ d ϕ d t v y ω 22 d d t v y v cos ϕ d ϕ d t v x ω combining all the above equations in the matrix form one obtains x t x t y t y t 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 ω t 0 0 0 1 0 ω t 0 0 x t x t y t y t v t 23 where v t is the process noise usually assumed to be gaussian noise after discrete treatment and laplace transformation of the above equation the system state transition matrix of the coordinate turn model when the rate of turn ω is known can be given as f k 1 sin ω t ω 0 cos ω t 1 ω 0 cos ω t 0 sin ω t 0 1 cos ω t ω 1 sin ω t ω 0 sin ω t 0 cos ω t 24 when the rate of turn is not known accurately the standard ct model should be extended to have an additional element ω in the state vector that is f k 1 sin ω t ω 0 cos ω t 1 ω 0 0 cos ω t 0 sin ω t 0 0 1 cos ω t ω 1 sin ω t ω 0 0 sin ω t 0 cos ω t 0 0 0 0 0 1 25 now the corresponding process noise distribution matrix is written as γ k 0 5 t 2 t 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 t 2 t 0 0 0 0 0 1 26 2 4 state filtering and estimation target tracking problem is typically deal with uncertainties these uncertainties mainly arise from uncertainty inherent with target motion termed as process noise and uncertainty with measurement observation model represented as measurement noise this uncertainty may also arise from the false noise occurred by multiple targets and due to cluttered surrounding hence filtering techniques are tools for estimation and prediction of target state to exclude the uncertainties allied with the target it is necessary to choose an appropriate filtering algorithm or to adjust the current algorithm on the basis of a well established dynamic motion model and observation model to satisfy the specific requirement of the target tracking system estimation theory requires the establishment of a system model describing the dynamic characteristics of the target and measurement processes a valuable method of describing the system model the state variable method is created on the system state equation and the observation equation according to this method the state variable system state equation system observation equation system noise and observation noise system input and output i e the estimated value of the state variable are the five essential elements of the target tracking system modelling the five elements above imitate the basic features of a system and can be viewed as a complete expression of a dynamic system the state variable at any given time is stated as a function of the state variable prior to that time the input and output relationship of the system is described by the state transition model and the output observation model in the time domain the state reflects the system s interior condition the input can be described by the state equation which is composed of the decided time function and the arbitrary process on behalf of the unpredictable variable or noise the output is a function of the state vector typically anxious by the arbitrary observation error and can be described by measurement equations in the system modelling process the use of the system state equation and the observation equation in the description of the dynamic characteristics of the target is therefore the most successful method the relation between the state model and the measurement model is shown in fig 4 3 target tracking based on image video information processing video tracking has various applications like video surveillance intelligent transportation human and object tracking and identification video games robotics traffic flow measurement industrial automation protective systems biometric medical diagnosis human computer interaction and public safety target tracking strategies differ depending on purpose of being used the majority of moving target tracking strategies can be monitored from one frame to the next in a series of images moghaddam and yarifard 2016 the purpose of visual target tracking is for precise location identification and tracking of target from images received from the collector continuously in terms of simplicity high quality security reliability high cost performance and low energy consumption visual target tracking technology has a specific social application value a video sequence may have a set of features that are influenced by the shooting situations and the frequency of each feature varies some common attributes of video sequence are aspect ratio change arc camera motion cm background clutter bc fast motion fm illumination variation iv full occlusion foc low resolution lr partial occlusion poc out of view ov scale variation sc similar object sob and viewpoint change vc jia et al 2020 visual tracking can be reflected as an substitute method for conventional recognition identification and tracking methods like radars fiyad et al 2020 vision based object tracking is a three stage video analysis procedure in which the first stage is associated with moving object identification the second with object recognition and the final stage is associated with object tracking in a specific picture the method of deciding the existence and attributes of an object is known as object classification the object tracking method then monitors the motion parameters of the specified object such as location velocity and acceleration the basic steps of object tracking process used in vision based tracking are shown in fig 5 tiwari and singhai 2017 for the object identification or detection in the visual target tracking several techniques such as background subtraction bs optical flow of temporal frame difference tfd and supervised learning sl techniques can be implemented the different methods for object detection are presented in fig 6 one of the most important detection methods for efficient visual monitoring is background subtraction the video frame s content is divided into two parts foreground and background the foreground is dealing with moving objects like cars and people while the background is associated with static images that do not move from one frame to another as the background shifts over time background subtraction suffers from performance degradation so the temporal frame difference strategy is used as the system camera is shifting optical flow is a method for locating moving objects in video frames that is widely used optical flow offers information regarding object orientation and displacement in the form of vectors due to its higher detection accuracy it produces a two dimensional vector field also known as a motion field which is better for multi objective moving interpretation in complex scenes with a dynamic background supervised learning is a technique for training a classifier to distinguish between various object views following training a decision is made whether the detected object is a target or not based on the specified area to identify goals supervised learning algorithms like decision trees support vector machines boosting and neural networks are used in kwan and budavari 2020 for object detection three well known methods of optical flow are investigated for tracking execution in low feature and long range infrared videos of small moving targets these three methods of extracting motion information in the videos or image sequence are lucas kanade lk algorithm total variance with l1 restriction tv l1 and high accuracy optical flow measurement using a warping theory brox in order to be accurate for target detection optical flow methods must be coupled with contrast improvement connected component analysis and target affiliation binocular stereo vision uses two cameras instead of using human eyes for measurement and judgment with the same specifications such as the same focal length sensor area and aperture the fundamental concept of binocular vision ranging is to use two left and right cameras to record the image of the measured object at the same time the object being measured is different as the positions of different camera vary screens this variation in location is referred to as disparity the disparity theory is used to gain three dimensional knowledge about the object the binocular stereo vision ranging system is suitable for non contact detection and quality control because it combines the benefits of high performance and precision sun et al 2019 stereoscopy is a recording and representation technique for stereoscopic 3d images it can generate the illusion of depth by combining two photographs taken from slightly different angles stereo vision is a method for creating a three dimensional representation of a scene from several perspectives a stereo camera is a camera that has two or even more lenses each with its own image sensor or film frame this enables the camera to mimic human binocular vision allowing it to capture three dimensional images a technique known as stereo photography stereo cameras can be used to create stereo views and 3d images for films as well as for range imaging patel et al 2013 an effective robust object tracking method for uav videos is anticipated based on learning isolated discriminative correlation filters for transformation and scale valuation xue et al 2018 a cellular automaton is presented to appraise the appearance template of target correctly and sparsely experiments are conducted on uav123 data set and results demonstrated the tracking efficacy of the proposed system in wan et al 2019 a computer vision based target tracking procedure pointed at locating uav confined targets like pedestrian and vehicle is suggested using sparse representation theory to deal with partial occlusion in uav videos a markov random field mrf based binary support vector with contiguous occlusion restriction is implemented the results show that the presented tracker can achieve better precision and success rates in cheng et al 2017 to monitor a maneuvering target for a rotorcraft unmanned aerial vehicle uav with an onboard gimbaled camera an autonomous vision based tracking system combining the kernelized correlation filter kcf tracker and the redetection method is investigated to estimate the states of the maneuvering target an imm ekf dependent estimator is presented the

with abilities based on parts and redetection of the analysis of the tracking framework he et al 2020 a correlation filter that combines the histogram of oriented gradient hog and color name cn features tracks each target sub block separately on the uav123 dataset the algorithm s performance is confirmed in liu et al 2020 an onboard visual tracking system based on the kcf tracker is presented for low cost uavs to track a moving target autonomously a 3 axis gimbaled camera with separate imu is used to aim at the particular target throughout its flights as shown in fig 7 the performance of the tracking system in terms of reliability and efficiency is validated successfully by chasing a ground and aerial target in an outside environment real time performance of target tracking based on vision digital signal processor vision dsp is investigated by evaluation of hardware optimization methods gong et al 2020 a kcf tracking procedure is implemented and this tracking system also includes ip instruction parallelism dp data parallelism and the characteristics of parallel processing of the idma integrated direct memory access and dsp core the experimental results illustrate the real time tracking speed and fulfill the expected system performance the kcf tracking algorithm is an innovative tracking system that improves processing speed by using properties of circulant matrices henriques et al 2015 in cui et al 2020 a real time system based on a binocular vision system is designed for submarine creature perception and positioning scpp with four corner neighborhood matching method fcnmm to achieve exact target positions to enhance the tracking performance a fusion correction mechanism fcm is combined with the kernelized correlation filter kcf tracking algorithm despite the fact that kcf has a strong theoretical basis and excellent experimental results in reality inaccurate tracking and lack of judgment of tracking failure would happen eventually in the case of complete occlusion the conventional kcf fails to monitor the targets correctly to improve kcf tracking efficiency a fusion correction mechanism fcm has been developed in cui et al 2020 the summary of fcm based kcf algorithm is presented in table 1 and for more details interested readers can refer the literature listed in the above references in gao et al 2021 a feature tracking algorithm for acoustic image sequences is anticipated for underwater target identification with local features feature trackers rely heavily on feature detectors and descriptors the proposed algorithm can accurately track potential targets in both linear and uncertain nonlinear systems according to experimental results using a monocular camera the efficiency of positioning control of an underwater vehicle with proportional p and proportional integral derivative pid control is investigated masuzaki et al 2021 in this approach in place of expensive imu template matching is used for tracking the target in underwater also various template matching similarity measurement methods such as number of squared differences ssd normalized cross correlation ncc and zero mean normalized cross correlation zncc are compared the results revealed that zncc is the most effective in detecting the target and that pid control is roughly 30 more accurate than p control 4 classification of target tracking based on mode of tracking on the basis of mode of tracking sensors target tracking system can be grouped into two categories namely passive and active target tracking in the passive target tracking only the target state can be assessed by emitted signal from the target it has only the receiver to obtain the signals emitted from the target in case of active tracking the additional information of range can be achieved by toa or tdoa since echoes produced by the tracker are reflected by the target in the simple meaning active target tracking has both transmitters and receivers 4 1 passive target tracking the passive target tracking problem can be described as bearing only tracking bot in which the target state is determined solely by measurements received from the target signals due to the intrinsic nonlinearity between the target state and the passive measurements the design and development of the bot algorithm for reliable and robust situations is still a challenging problem in both theoretical and real world aspects for applications like air traffic control underwater surveillance and ground based acoustic sensor surveillance the angle only target tracking problems have been widely employed in such problems the target motion parameters are estimated form noise corrupted measurement of target angle su et al 2020 4 2 active target tracking active target tracking aims at assessing the target state on the base of bearing and range data delivered by the target echoes and the echoes are generated within the system itself hence there are transmitters and receivers in the active tracking system nevertheless due to concealment tracking systems consisting of active sources have low control efficiency in anti submarine warfare asw because of the existing range data produced by the active measurements the target position can also be easily obtained hence the target tracking algorithm on the basis of active measurement is an interesting research centre for applications for underwater target tracking the sensor used for measurement purpose in the application of aerial underwater tracking or mobile robotics can be classified into two categories namely proprioceptive sensors and exteroceptive sensors condomines 2018 proprioceptive sensors are being used to assess the vehicle s movement across space based upon the information that is interpreted locally e g acceleration measurements this yields the results that are simple to exploit and independent of environmental factors which are important in autonomous uav navigation proprioceptive sensors include the gyroscope and accelerometer exteroceptive sensors gather data about the vehicle s surroundings pressure magnetic field etc this dataset contains information of observations about an absolute reference frame attached to the environment e g satellite position these sensors provide useful data that might be used to reconfigure the localization collected by using proprioceptive sensors to monitor the vehicle s motion on a regular basis the common examples of exteroceptive sensors are satellite positioning systems barometric altimeters magnetometers cameras and telemeters sonar lidar inertial measurement units imu inertial navigation systems ins and attitude and heading reference systems ahrs the majority of active remote systems employed in remote sensing activities work in the microwave range of the electromagnetic spectrum that allows it to spread across the atmosphere in most situations laser altimeter scatterometer lidar radar ranging instrument and sounder are examples of active remote sensing systems lidar and radar are two popular active sensors used in remote sensing the sensor detects natural radiation that is generated or reflected by the target in a passive remote sensing system most of the passive sensors work in visible thermal infrared infrared and microwave segments of the electromagnetic spectrum accelerometer imaging radiometer hyperspectral radiometer radiometer spectrometer sounder and spectroradiometer are examples of passive remote sensing devices the spectrometer is a popular passive sensor used in remote sensing the spectral content of incident electromagnetic radiation is detected measured and analysed by a spectrometer sensor shakhatreh et al 2019 5 classification of target tracking based on application target tracking can be classified in many ways which have been presented in many literatures here based on applications target tracking is classified into two categories namely unmanned aerial tracking and unmanned underwater tracking the development of mathematical modelling of uavs and auvs is almost similar in nature there is a difference in drag and lift force consideration as it is neglected in the modelling of underwater vehicles due to its slow speed the major differences are in navigation and communication of uavs and auvs most of the aerial systems rely on radio wave or spectrum based communication incorporated with global positioning system gps while underwater systems use acoustic based sensors for the communication since it is impossible to travel the radio waves too far inside the water and as auv system dives in the water gets disconnected with gps signals dead reckoning is a standard way to navigate auvs in underwater however by implementing an acoustic based positioning system like usbl and imu navigation can be improved the localization navigation and communication of auvs are major challenges due to absence of gps and radio wave communication in gonzález garcía et al 2020 different alternative methods such as inertial dead reckoning acoustic geophysical and optical based technologies are comprehensively presented with relative drawbacks and advantages inertial based navigation system can be accepted for long range mission for the accuracy needed in tens or hundreds of meters while for small range mission accuracy needed in millimetres or centimetres an sbl usbl system operating at a frequency of 200 khz can be accepted a hybrid navigation comprised of acoustic light and or vision based system is an encouraging preference for the communication of collaborative auvs 5 1 unmanned aerial tracking with the advancement and growth in technology uavs are finding wide range of applications and gaining the popularity among the people in research and industry earlier uavs were used in defence application only but due to people s awareness and technological advancement now uavs find vast range of applications such as surveillance smart farming and agriculture environment monitoring building structure photogrammetry rescue operation in disaster management civil security video capturing and filming and surveying wildfire tracking cloud monitoring delivering goods and power line inspection cabreira et al 2019 nadir et al 2019 alladi et al 2020 the uavs are aerial platforms that do not have pilots on board a human control such platforms remotely and manually but they also operate automated pre programmed flights intelligent systems with on board sensors can be used to operate the autonomous flights cabreira et al 2019 in mohamed et al 2018 potential applications of uavs in smart cities like health emergency services uav based infrastructure inspection security and crowd monitoring agriculture management and monitoring traffic monitoring and management tourism support etc are reviewed many such problems in smart cities can be handled by integrating uavs to obtain intelligent and cost effective solutions uavs can now carry out complex and dangerous missions without the need of human interference with the integration of sensors and cameras this is accomplished with high productivity and speed while keeping costs down nadir et al 2019 in kumar et al 2021 by investigating the types of sensors suitable for smart farming and agriculture the design adaptation and use of uavs have been presented the possibilities and challenges of using uavs in smart farming are investigated it has been concluded that the use of uavs and associated technologies has made a significant contribution to the enhancement and optimization of various agricultural processes uavs have an effect on the cultivation process by conducting efficient monitoring and spraying operations allowing pesticides and fertilisers to work to their full potential 5 1 1 principal components of uav aerial vehicles are composite systems consist of hardware and software arrangements the technological advancement permitted the growth of navigation and control systems more progressively available for the required applications the key components of an uav can be distributed into three main groups i aerial platform includes the airframe power system navigation system and the payload ii ground control station gcs can be autonomous or human operated and iii communication system to ensure communication and data links between the uav and the ground station giordan et al 2020 5 1 2 uav classification there are several factors to consider while classifying the uavs like fuselage rotary fixed flapping wings flying mechanism weight flying altitude wing type endurance mean take off weight mtow flying mode lighter heavier than air and mission or application hence there is no unique classification acknowledged in the literature nadir et al 2019 according to flight mechanism uavs can be classified into different group such as fixed wing rotary wing or multi rotor and hybrid wing alladi et al 2020 fixed wing uavs like commercial aeroplanes can glide through the atmosphere and carry large payloads the rotary wing provides manoeuvrability benefits a hybrid fixed rotary wing uav is a balance between the two mechanisms combining the benefits of both fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft allowing for vtol high speed flight and longer flight times uavs can be also categorized into two kinds namely low altitude platform lap and high altitude platform hap based on the altitude at that they are intended to operate cabreira et al 2019 because of their great mobility and cost effectiveness lap styled uavs is ideal for fast and versatile deployment hap styled uavs have the ability to reach a wider range of areas in a single flight due to their massive size and long endurance mtow is a good metric to classify the uavs for the regulatory purpose since it associates well with the estimated kinetic energy reported at impact which in turn is reflected to be primary factor affecting the security of actions on the base of mtow and ground impact risk uavs can be classified as micro mini small light ultra light normal and large dalamagkidis 2015 control strategy associated with unmanned vehicles is an important factor to decide the level of autonomy level and reliability of the system a simple classification of uavs on the basis of level of human involvement in required operation or autonomy can be divided into three types as remotely piloted semi autonomous and fully autonomous control strategies sharma and subudhi 2019 in remote control strategy vehicles installed with autopilot are capable to strongly perform the control command nevertheless there is a deficiency of decision making or planning system implicating the vehicle is directed by human operators while in semi autonomous control strategy a higher level of control strategy than the remote control the vehicles are not only fitted out with autopilot but also with decision making but only modest missions can be autonomously completed by the vehicles and there is a necessity of human operator particularly during challenging circumstances fully autonomous control strategy has the highest control strategy among all the vehicle is capable to entirely autonomously perform all types of missions under most circumstances without any interference from human operators the autonomy level versus the system reliability or robustness is compared for three different control strategies as shown in fig 8 due to involvement of human operator the remote control strategy has lowest autonomy level and highest system reliability while there is highest autonomy level for the fully autonomous control strategy by scarifying the system robustness or reliability semi autonomous control strategy has compromised autonomy level and system reliability moreover advanced sensor suites intelligent decision making algorithm artificial intelligence technology and efficient data transmission

7 challenges and future directions in this work the possible applications of autonomous vehicle in underwater and aerial target tracking scenario are discussed to enhance the tracking performance of the unmanned autonomous target tracking following improvements such as improvement in the detection algorithms feasibility and flexibility to specific task improvement in navigation system globally integrated framework of safety regulatory three dimensional robust and adaptive tracking algorithms on board computerised tracking controller are needed there are many works on experimental study presented in the literature but still there is a lot of scope for experimental investigation on autonomous target tracking to depict the real tracking scenario there are several studies reported for unmanned vehicles regarding the progress of autonomous system that works without any human intervention the autonomous system of any unmanned vehicles should be capable of decision making to react the tasks or activities without the help of human directly the on board image handling and ability of in filed analysis can be provided by the next generation of uav sensor that can result in ease and efficient tracking performance the limited power availability and payload of unmanned vehicles restricts the on board sensor needed for operation vision based uavs system has huge potential applications for detection and control in agriculture civil infrastructure traffic monitoring surveying for different aspects and etc the efficiency and accuracy of vision based autonomous system can be enhanced by image processing algorithms either by improving the image detection to ease of human or identifying the image themselves although vision based tracking methods required high computational operation for the handling of images these are still used in collision avoidance the camera and optical sensors used in vision based tracking need sufficient light to function properly presence of steam and or smoke could result in performance deficiency in order to improve the collision avoidance uavs could be incorporated with infrared and or ultrasonic sensors laser range finder and vision sensors the collision avoidance algorithm of multi uav system must be performed quickly due to high speed of uavs that is challenge for the researchers an unmanned vehicle should have three dimensional optimal path planning and obstacle avoidance to show the real behaviour but most of the auvs and uavs are modelled in two dimensions for the sake of simplicity and avoiding burden of computational load more researches need to be carried out considering three dimensions for path planning and selection of trajectory for the long range mission and fully automated unmanned vehicles sensor improvement high speed communication computer vision adaptive control and on board computer based tracking algorithms can be explored in the future in harmful underwater environments auvs have a huge number of applications in order to have a large scale adoption and reliable fully autonomous system these have to overcome some constraints low cost long lasting batteries underwater wireless communication advanced manufacturing techniques intelligent materials compact on board computers with high computing power and on board energy generation for better decision making are some of the key challenges in order to efficient tracking system these are some limitations that need to overcome in order to have full autonomous system reliable on large scale adoption the design of powerful on board processor with less consumption of power is still an interesting and active scope of researches most of the compact small scale auvs are bio mimetic in nature these bio mimetic auvs are quiet in operation and generally used in monitoring and survey applications the auvs can be equipped with more bio mimetic components to rise the efficiency in future for the better localization of target in the underwater surroundings of small scale auvs many innovative navigation methods have been presented for short range mission in literature it is difficult to decide the type of localization or navigation system best suited for underwater mission because of variation in mission with its own challenges and limitations auvs have to use the auxiliary surface to use gps for long term mission leads to its dependency on communication network to overcome this auvs can be equipped with more accurate and robust navigation methods in future the test beds are being currently used for the simulation of uavs and auvs need to be more mature and should be capable of handling the cyber attack to provide cyber security different filtering techniques have been presented in the literature for auv uav applications considering different aspects the success rate of filtering technique is identified by its minimum number of failures in estimation process during a certain number of operations but there is no such estimation technique which gives hundred percent of success rate in estimation hence there is a lot of research scope for developing new filtering technique to provide the more success rate also reducing the computational burden of the estimation techniques is a challenge for researchers in order to enhance the tracking performance most of the underwater tracking systems depend on the tethering networks such as lan and fibre optics cables for communication these cables also provide the hydrodynamic instability to the tracking vehicles and increase the drag the major limitations of these cables are manoeuvrability and accessibility wireless underwater communication is still a major challenge with high speed and high volume data 8 conclusions this paper gives the
