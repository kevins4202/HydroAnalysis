failure modes for a box type lng cargo containment system against sloshing dynamic loads from an lng carrier cargo tank the design load for no96 ccs sloshing is a typical dynamic event hence the dynamic effect on the buckling capacity is investigated as the defining dynamic strength factor a series of finite element fe analyses for the insulation system are performed using commercial fe software i e abaqus and ansys and considering the environmental temperature and material properties of the system the design buckling strength under both static and dynamic conditions is provided based on the fe calculations and compared with the as designed criteria of dnv gl for a membrane type lng cargo tank keywords no96 ccs sloshing impact load dynamic buckling strength dynamic buckling capacity 1 introduction the recent market trend of liquefied natural gas lng has demonstrated a large demand for bigger lng cargo tanks in lng carriers and the use of floating production storage offloading fpso floating storage regasification unit applications this trend requires a strong cargo containment system capable of dealing with a sloshing impact load therefore damage from the possible sloshing of the lng cargo has become a challenging topic lee et al 2016 2004 with regard to research on design sloshing loads bunnik and huijsmans 2009 lee et al 2007 and peric et al 2009 investigated the sloshing impact loads using experimental and numerical approaches further ryu et al 2016 studied the design of the sloshing impact loads for a two row lng cargo tank for lng fpso applications using extensive sloshing model tests meanwhile kim 2013 investigated the rapid response calculation of an lng cargo containment system against the sloshing impact loads using wavelet transformation as regards the structural assessment of an lng cargo containment system against the sloshing events in an lng cargo tank gtt mark iii and no96 ccs are the most common insulation systems employed for the current membrane type lng carriers kim et al 2010 fig 1 accordingly various experimental and or numerical studies were performed involving the gtt mark iii type cargo containment system kim et al 2010 chun et al 2009 arswendy and moan 2015 conducted experimental and numerical studies to determine the buckling and crushing strengths of a t shaped plywood specimen as a part of no96 ccs compared to an independent type cargo containment system one of the major advantages of a membrane type lng cargo containment system is the flexibility it offers to increase the cargo tank size however the risk of sloshing damage to the membranes is an important factor to consider when selecting a membrane type lng cargo containment system several factors must be considered when assessing the risk of sloshing damage and deciding on the feasibility of a membrane type lng cargo containment system adequate design capacities and parameters must be regarded for each cargo containment system and each design choice to be applied major design load cases for the lng cargo containment system should come from a dynamic impact type such as sloshing thus the investigation of the system s dynamic buckling strength is very critical mouhata and abdellatif 2015 and fan et al 2016 performed dynamic and static buckling analyses on stiffened panels using nonlinear finite element fe simulations for steel welded structures meanwhile ravi sankar and parameswaran 2016 conducted experimental and numerical works to find the effect of multiple holes on the dynamic buckling capacities for an aluminum material thang and nguyen thoi 2016 studied the nonlinear buckling of sigmoid functionally graded material toroidal shell segments through analytical and numerical methods moreover ramezannezhad azarboni et al 2015 and kubiak 2007 investigated the effect of boundary conditions on the dynamic buckling behavior using analytical methods bisagni 2005 studied the dynamic buckling of a thin walled carbon fiber material with a cylinder type structure through a numerical approach however at this moment limited specific design strength capacities of a lng ccs are publicly available in addition relevant studies specifically with respect to no96 ccs i e dynamic strength of a plywood material are very limited therefore research on the design capacities is required to increase the certainty for designers and decision makers when selecting a membrane type lng cargo containment system the design buckling capacity of no96 ccs which is the most critical failure mode of the system was determined herein using commercial fe software sloshing is a typical dynamic event hence the dynamic strength was evaluated based on the dynamic strength factor dsf the final strength determined in this study was compared with that found using the method developed by dnvgl cg 0187 2016 2 no96 ccs fig 2 shows a typical cargo tank lining reinforced with no96 ccs the insulation zone was divided by the lower part of the upper chamfer i e a non reinforced area and a reinforced area shaded area in fig 2 gtt and different shipyards developed several types of no96 ccs that apply different thicknesses of the horizontal cover panel and vertical bulkhead members or the number of bulkheads particularly on a secondary box depending on the level of the design sloshing loads various no96 ccs designs were developed and applied to lng carriers and fpsos for this research nine types of no96 ccs were studied as examples of a target ccs to define the dynamic buckling strength table 1 no96 ccs for several different lng carriers was considered herein to calculate and define the design buckling strength further details on the no96 system used can be found at http www gtt fr product no96 system however detailed drawings and scantlings for the major strength members were not shown to maintain confidentiality 3 fe modeling of no96 ccs table 2 summarizes the specifications of the fe simulations for the current study the primary and secondary insulation boxes should be modeled as separate entities fig 4 shows a typical fe model of a gtt no96 ccs for a flat area the fe model contained two individual parts namely a primary box and a secondary box the cover plates for the reinforced primary box with double cover plates cases ii ix in table 1 were modeled as separate entities and connected using staples an elastic one dimensional spring element was introduced for the staple connection with a spring stiffness of 10 000 n mm the same number of staples and the same positions were applied according to gtt no96 fig 4 the interaction between the primary and secondary boxes was modeled as a contact constraint series fe analyses were performed with 5000 7500 10 000 12 500 and 15 000 n mm of elastic spring stiffness to investigate the effect of the spring stiffness on the fe results fig 5 shows the reference stresses by five different elastic spring stiffnesses on the center of the bulkhead of the secondary box which was the most critical location on a buckling failure according to the series analyses the elastic spring stiffness of no96 had no effect on the buckling failure mode the primary and secondary invar membranes were disregarded because they were not strength members the no96 ccs was modeled using four node shell elements the average element size of the fe model was approximately 20 mm the elements in the bulkhead plates were modeled using squares to the greatest extent possible the secondary box was to be fixed in the vertical direction at the intersection lines between the bulkhead plates and the bottom plate a minimum restraint against the in plane translation and a rigid body rotation of the model were imposed at two bottom corners of the secondary box the plywood material was modeled as a homogeneous linear orthotropic elastic material the material properties were selected based on the material directions specified in fig 6 as well as on the proper design operating temperature conditions for plywood the material stiffness of the design temperature shall be considered because of the low temperature in the lng cargo tank accordingly the material properties of the design temperature in table 3 from dnvgl cg 0158 2016 were considered in the current study the fe heat transfer analyses for no96 ccs were performed herein to apply the material properties depending on the design temperature of an lng cargo tank fig 7 shows the fe results for the flat area of the no96 ccs based on a thermal analysis the fe models contained strength members such as plywood panels and insulation material i e perlite a partial thermal component glass wool rigid insulation and an invar membrane including air in a void volume the fe model also considered a securing device to study the thermal loss effect the fe results showed that the thermal distribution through the no96 ccs height direction can be assumed linear as the dotted line in fig 7 shows therefore a linear interpolation scheme for the material properties based on temperature was applied to the fe model to consider the design operating temperature on the material properties shown in table 2 4 design load cases in the membrane type lng cargo tank twelve sloshing load exposed areas were assumed to cover all reasonable sloshing impact pressure distributions considering the possible sloshing pressure propagation paths fig 9 shows these load exposed areas the entire area of the insulation box was divided into nine cells the load exposed areas were combinations of these cells obtained through sloshing impact propagation the smallest areas foot prints fps 1 2 3 and 4 covered 1 9th of the full cover plate of the cargo containment system and were located in the corner of a tight bulkhead and an inner hull of an lng tank whereas the largest case fp12 covered the full size of the cargo containment system a rise time of 0 1 20 ms was regarded in the current study to consider the sloshing pressure such as in a typical impact event the skewness parameter generally defined as 2 the rise time the duration of a sloshing load is known to affect the response of the insulation boxes however a skewness factor of 1 0 was considered as the representative value herein fig 8 5 development of the buckling capacity curves for no96 ccs 5 1 static buckling strength of the plywood panels elastic buckling is a state in which a structure loses its stability and large elastic deflections start to rapidly develop this state is normally associated with the minimum eigenvalue of a perfect structure often referred to as classical buckling the linear static buckling strengths of no96 were compared in this chapter based on a classical buckling strength formula and a numerical simulation i e eigenvalue analyses the buckling strength of no96 ccs can be based on the following strength equation determined through the classic buckling

linear buckling strength was determined through fe eigenvalue analyses for a comparison of the linear buckling strengths found through the dnvgl cg 0158 2016 eq 1 table 4 shows the linear buckling strength of no96 ccs for 12 load cases i e fp1 to fp12 based on the eigenvalue fe analyses as the reference values for no96 ccs for each load case and the classic buckling theory including each buckling failure location table 4 presents that all buckling failure modes were observed in the bulkheads of the secondary box except for one case i e fp4 ccs 3 which was in the internal bulkhead of the primary box fig 10 and fig 11 show the deformed contours of the secondary box against fp11 fp12 of ccs 2 and 4 respectively table 4 and fig 12 show comparisons of the static buckling capacities for each ccs calculated through the eigenvalue fe analyses and using dnvgl cg 0158 2016 buckling eq 1 according to the comparison the static capacities for each calculation showed a large difference value because of the following reasons the material capacity such as the maximum compressive stress of a plywood panel 43 0 mpa through dnvgl cg 0158 2016 was not considered for the buckling strength determined through the eigenvalue analyses the ultimate buckling strength determined through the dnvgl cg 0158 2016 equation was based on the failure criteria of the local member for a conservative design purpose the dnvgl cg 0158 2016 method was selected for a design static buckling strength calculation method to define a static buckling strength 5 2 dynamic buckling strength of the plywood panels a buckling failure event from a sloshing load in an lng cargo tank is a typical dynamic event hence the dynamic buckling failure criteria of no96 ccs should be considered the dynamic effect was accounted for by multiplying the critical buckling stress by a dsf defined as a function of the rise time of the external load and the natural period of the bulkhead plate series fe analyses were conducted to define the dsf nonlinear transient fe analyses using a two dimensional shell element were performed for nine cases table 5 and were representative of different bulkhead thicknesses breadths heights from four ccs types table 1 see table 6 the dynamic buckling strength was defined herein by the following steps the dynamic buckling failure was a typically geometric instability hence the maximum deflection of the center height of the bulkhead panel was observed fe simulations for a certain rise time with various peak pressure values were conducted until the maximum deflection was very significantly increased fig 13 fig 14 shows the maximum deflection for the dynamic compressive loads with varying peak pressures to define the dynamic buckling strength the level of peak pressure was increased hence the maximum deflection also slowly increased up to a normalized peak pressure of approximately 3 2 the maximum deflection then suddenly dramatically increased because of the geometrical instability of the plywood panel the dynamic buckling strength was defined herein as point a in fig 14 fig 14 also shows that the time series of load indentation and deflection become unstable after point a current dynamic buckling simulations do not consider the material failure event for compressive loads hence the dynamic buckling strength with a very short rise time will be divergent i e no limitation the present study applied the static material compressive strength as the maximum dynamic buckling strength for a conservative design purpose the material compressive strength depends on the rise time of the external load however the present study applied the static material compressive strength as the maximum buckling failure criteria for a conservative design purpose the dynamic buckling strength can be defined in eq 1 as the linear static buckling strength multiplied by the dsf dnv gl cg 0158 2016 proposes a closed form equation of the dynamic strength factor with the function of rise time the natural period this study proposed a new dsf based on dynamic fe simulations for plywood panels which was then compared with the dnv gl approach dnv gl cg 0158 2016 in terms of the buckling capacities of no96 ccs for an early design purpose on a selection of a proper cargo containment system depending on the level of design sloshing loads the buckling capacities considering a dynamic event based on dnv gl s dsf and the newly proposed dsf were also compared series fe analyses were performed to formulate the dynamic buckling strength of a plywood panel present in a no96 cargo containment system table 4 shows that all buckling failure modes were observed at the bulkheads of the secondary box thus case studies for the current dynamic buckling were conducted using the bulkheads of the secondary box as defined in table 5 the dsf can be expressed as a function of the rise time and natural period fig 15 17 the design eqs 2 4 of the dsf were developed in this study eqs 2 4 were developed to calculate the dsf using panel widths of 333 0 mm 499 5 mm and 999 0 mm respectively 2 d s f min σ f σ c 1 545 t r t e 2 4 272

the fea simulations and the closed formulae of eqs 2 4 the maximum coefficient of variation for eqs 2 4 was 0 146 with a mean value of 1 129 therefore eqs 2 4 were conservatively developed to estimate the dynamic buckling strength evaluation of no96 ccs the dynamic buckling strengths were calculated based on eqs 2 4 and the linear static buckling strengths for each ccs number i e 1 to 4 and compared with the dnv gl formula 2016 figs 15 17 for most of the cases considered the dnv gl formula 2016 provided very conservative dynamic capacities of the ccs excluding ccs 4 with approximately 1 0 of normalized rise time period this study found that the static buckling strength of ccs 4 was much greater than those of the other ccss because of the additional strength members i e two combs in the secondary box table 1 and fig 3 thus the dsf for ccs 4 was smaller than those of the other cases 5 3 design buckling strength the present study developed new design buckling strength capacities for four types of ccs defined in table 1 with 12 fps of the loaded areas for design practical purposes fig 19 22 show the design buckling strengths for each ccs type a comparison with the dnv gl design formula was also performed 6 conclusion this study proposed the design buckling strength of no96 ccs as a function of the normalized rise time of the dynamic sloshing impact pressure through fe simulations the designed buckling strength was calculated for four types of ccs depending on the bulkhead thickness and the number of combs in the secondary box and based on 12 loaded areas when considering the operating temperature the comparison of the designed buckling strengths of no96 ccs based on dnvgl cg 0158 2016 indicated that the dnv gl s formula of the dynamic ccs buckling capacity provided too much conservatism particularly for cases with a short rise time period e g approximately less than 1 25 of the normalized rise time impact conditions the dsf of ccs 4 was relatively smaller than that in the other cases because of the greater buckling strength of the secondary box hence the strength margin of the dynamic capacities of a ccs was higher compared to that in the dnv gl method for cases with a 1 25 normalized rise time of impact or a shorter rise time for most types of ccs the ccs 4 design requires caution when the dnv gl formula is applied the currently proposed design buckling strength of no96 ccs is expected to be used for the early design of a box type lng cargo containment system applied to both lng carrier and fpso dnvgl cg 0158 2016 and the present study applied the static compressive material strength as the limit of the dynamic buckling failure criteria because of the lack of a database of the dynamic compressive material strength for the plywood panel of no96 ccs in a public domain however the approach should be very conservative especially on a relatively short rise time of load cases the authors are currently performing experimental works to investigate the dynamic effect on the buckling failure criteria the results will be separately updated soon acknowledgment this work was supported by the dong a university research fund

eqs 2 4 of the dsf were developed in this study eqs 2 4 were developed to calculate the dsf using panel widths of 333 0 mm 499 5 mm and 999 0 mm respectively 2 d s f min σ f σ c 1 545 t r t e 2 4 272

the fea simulations and the closed formulae of eqs 2 4 the maximum coefficient of variation for eqs 2 4 was 0 146 with a mean value of 1 129 therefore eqs 2 4 were conservatively developed to estimate the dynamic buckling strength evaluation of no96 ccs the dynamic buckling strengths were calculated based on eqs 2 4 and the linear static buckling strengths for each ccs number i e 1 to 4 and compared with the dnv gl formula 2016 figs 15 17 for most of the cases considered the dnv gl formula 2016 provided very conservative dynamic capacities of the ccs excluding ccs 4 with approximately 1 0 of normalized rise time period this study found that the static buckling strength of ccs 4 was much greater than those of the other ccss because of the additional strength members i e two combs in the secondary box table 1 and fig 3 thus the dsf for ccs 4 was smaller than those of the other cases 5 3 design buckling strength the present study developed new design buckling strength capacities for four types of ccs defined in table 1 with 12 fps of the loaded areas for design practical purposes fig 19 22 show the design buckling strengths for each ccs type a comparison with the dnv gl design formula was also performed 6 conclusion this study proposed the design buckling strength of no96 ccs as a function of the normalized rise time of the dynamic sloshing impact pressure through fe simulations the designed buckling strength was calculated for four types of ccs depending on the bulkhead thickness and the number of combs in the secondary box and based on 12 loaded areas when considering the operating temperature the comparison of the designed buckling strengths of no96 ccs based on dnvgl cg 0158 2016 indicated that the dnv gl s formula of the dynamic ccs buckling capacity provided too much conservatism particularly for cases with a short rise time period e g approximately less than 1 25 of the normalized rise time impact conditions the dsf of ccs 4 was relatively smaller than that in the other cases because of the greater buckling strength of the secondary box hence the strength margin of the dynamic capacities of a ccs was higher compared to that in the dnv gl method for cases with a 1 25 normalized rise time of impact or a shorter rise time for most types of ccs the ccs 4 design requires caution when the dnv gl formula is applied the currently proposed design buckling strength of no96 ccs is expected to be used for the early design of a box type lng cargo containment system applied to both lng carrier and fpso dnvgl cg 0158 2016 and the present study applied the static compressive material strength as the limit of the dynamic buckling failure criteria because of the lack of a database of the dynamic compressive material strength for the plywood panel of no96 ccs in a public domain however the approach should be very conservative especially on a relatively short rise time of load cases the authors are currently performing experimental works to investigate the dynamic effect on the buckling failure criteria the results will be separately updated soon acknowledgment this work was supported by the dong a university research fund 
23511,this study proposes a pile guided floater a new mooring concept for large offshore floating structures such as an offshore liquefied natural gas lng bunkering terminal the economic feasibility of the new mooring system was demonstrated through a cost benefit analysis the environmental loads acting on the floaters were computed using wave data at the target location the mooring system was designed using finite element analysis to estimate the additional investment an lng ship to ship bunkering operation that included an lng bunkering terminal lng carrier lng bunkering shuttle and lng receiving ship was adopted to estimate the technical feasibility and economic benefit of the proposed mooring system the availabilities of two types of lng bunkering terminals were compared considering the acceptance criteria for lng ship to ship transfers one lng bunkering terminal was a typical barge type floater and the other was the pile guided floater the relative motion of the terminal with the lng carrier and the lng bunkering shuttle was analyzed the limiting wave height was determined from the maximum relative vertical motion between the floaters at the position of the lng loading arms the availability of the pile guided lng bunkering terminal was significantly improved owing to the reduced vertical motion finally a cost benefit analysis verified that the new mooring concept for an offshore lng bunkering terminal was economically feasible keywords operational availability lng ship to ship transfer lng bunkering system motion study pile guided floater 1 introduction the requirements and regulations concerning ship emissions are expected to be strengthened to protect the global environment the international maritime organization imo revised the marpol annex vi which consists of two standards for ship emissions the first standard is a global standard applied to all types of ships in signatory countries of the marpol treaty and the second standard pertains to emission control areas eca subject to rigorous limitations imo 2009 in addition to the regulations the marine environment protection committee mepc concluded at its 59th session in 2009 that an energy efficiency design index eedi for new ships was required the committee established an eedi formula to measure the co2 efficiency of new ships mepc 2009 devanney 2011 studied the impact of the eedi on very large crude carriers vlccs therein recommending that a newly developed vlcc should be designed to comply with the eedi formula to ensure that their co2 emissions could be reduced by 19 compared to the current design by 2013 by 36 by 2018 and by 47 by 2023 to meet these requirements liquefied natural gas lng is increasingly considered as an alternative fuel as it is environmentally friendly and cost effective for lng to be used as a marine fuel on a global scale various equipment and infrastructure including the volume efficient onboard lng storage tanks large size gas engines and lng bunkering facilities should be developed adachi et al 2014 proposed a concept of 9300 teu container ships fuelled by lng and performed an economic analysis to compare the concept for existing technologies for oil fuelled ships to comply with tier iii wang and notteboom 2014 reviewed several studies on the use of lng as a bunker for ship propulsion presented recent perspectives and challenges and suggested future studies by analyzing the limitations of the current studies economic feasibility safety and reliability are the key issues for the new lng technologies many studies have addressed fuel lng supply chains and related infrastructure from an economic perspective brett 2006 expected that lng would be used for a bunker in compliance with rigorous regulations of imo and investigated the lng market the current and potential fleet of lng fuelled marine vessels and the lng bunkering terminal lng bt many uncertainties can arise in a reliability analysis of a new technology komal et al 2015 estimated the fuzzy reliability of a dual fuel steam turbine propulsion system for lng carriers lngc using the proposed methodology to address uncertain data lng bunkering at ports is receiving increased attention from many interested parties including the port authorities lng distribution companies shipping companies and societies these parties will prefer to not only comply with the expected regulations but also reduce the cost of the supplied lng fuel for ships in safe and environmentally friendly manner according to the recent articles and reports although the market for lng bunkering has not been fully activated because of various uncertainties it is expected to grow stably up to 2020 the four types of lng bunkering approaches have been considered truck to ship tts port to ship pts portable tank transfer ptt and ship to ship sts currently tts and pts are generally employed however sts lng bunkering is attracting interest because of the limitations in terms of the size and sites of the other methods as the oceangoing ships continue to grow in size and the high complexity of the ship traffic near the main ports although the sts type of lng bunkering provides various benefits in terms of accessibility capacity improved safety space application in ports and initial investment it faces challenges related to the stability and operational availability of floating bodies during lng transfer choi 2014 to further consider the economic feasibility of the novel lng bt concept operational availability must be evaluated based on the motion study of the main floating bodies yun et al 2015 the relative movements of two floating bodies and availability are crucial issues for the lng sts operation recently several studies have been conducted on the side by side lng floating systems naciri et al 2007 performed time domain simulation between a floating lng flng and a vessel for side by side lng offloading bunnik 2014 also conducted a simulation of the large relative movements of multibody sts operations ewans and jameson 2015 evaluated the availability of offloading with respect to an lng barge where long term datasets of wave wind and current were used to estimate the availability the results and engineering criteria were compared for three locations nigeria the north west shelf of australia and the southern north sea the coupled motion responses of the lng floating systems were analyzed and the numerical and experimental results were compared for two cases one case was the motion study between two similar shuttle tankers and the other case considered a floating production storage and offloading system for lng flng with a shuttle tanker pessoa et al 2015 a procedure for computing the reliability of the offloading operation was studied two identical lngcs were considered as the case study limiting weather conditions were analyzed in compliance with failure probability criteria hagen et al 2015 pessoa et al 2016 performed a numerical and experimental study on the wave induced responses with respect to flng and shuttle tankers that were moored side by side the second order wave effects were considered for the coupled dynamic analysis the relative motions and loads on the mooring lines were considered in terms of the system operability mega scale floaters play a significant role in various lng supply chains an lng bt is a mega scale floater that contains many tanks for storing a large amount of lng many supporting and mooring technologies have been developed to support huge floaters although the jacket structure and jack up rig type are typical support structures they are inappropriate for an lng bt because of its enormous self weight the gravity based structure suffers from limitations in terms of economics sts transfer and soil conditions at target locations in the case of the spread mooring system the use of many cables obstructs the access by vessels thus these forms of mooring systems are unsuitable for an offshore lng bt lee et al 2016 introduced the pile guide mooring system for the lng bt and proposed a decision procedure for its target reliability from the whole life cycle cost perspective an offshore lng bt is a key infrastructure of the lng fuelled ships and the stable sts lng transfer is one of the most challenging issues this study designs a new mooring system for an offshore lng bt and evaluates the operational availability of the pile guided lng bt to quantify its economic advantages an lng bunkering system and the proposed mooring structure are described in section 2 the pile guide mooring system is designed by finite element analysis fea considering the wave excitation force in the target location in section 3 a motion study on two types of lng bts with an lngc and an lng bunkering shuttle lng bs is performed to determine the limiting wave height to evaluate the operational availability of the sts lng transfer section 4 compares the operational availability of the barge type lng bt and the pile guided lng bt finally a cost benefit analysis is conducted to show the economic feasibility of the novel mooring system for the offshore lng bt 2 system description 2 1 description of an offshore lng bunkering system fig 1 shows an lng sts bunkering chain the lngc facilitates long distance marine transportation of lng from a production plant to the lng bt the lng bt will be installed near busan new port the lng bt stores 300 000 m3 of imported lng and transfers it to the lng bss which transport the fuel to the lng receiving ships lng rs yun et al 2015 this study considers busan new port as the target port it is the largest harbor in south korea with a large number of visiting ships yun et al 2015 according to the busan port authority bpa there are various investment plans including the bunkering terminal this is an attempt to make the busan new port an international hub for the northeast asia the exact location and position of the lng bt are determined considering the wave height and direction the water depth at the lng bt area is approximately 30 m 2 2 concept of a pile guided floater for an lng bt lee et al 2016 introduced the concept of the pile guided floater pgf as an alternative technology for the mooring system of the lng bt fig 2 the pgf combines the advantages of the floating type and fixed type platforms a total of 14 vertical guide piles are used to support the floater taking into the account of the six lng storage tanks the guide piles are inserted into the pile housing the self weight of an lng bt is not applied to the support structures because the floater undergoes only heave motion along the guide piles the guide piles should endure the horizontal loads from an lng bt induced by waves or the forces of an lngc or lng bs when they approach the floater for sts operations the lng sts transfer can be satisfactorily accomplished with the guide piles and the seabed truss structures 2 3 design of the pile guide mooring system the weight of the lng bt which should have good accessibility for the ships for lng transfer is expected to be more than 200 000 tons designing a suitable mooring system within a reasonable cost is a key task for the lng bt this study designs the pile guide mooring system considering the environmental conditions at the target location fea is performed to determine the dimensions of the main parts of the mooring system 2 3 1 wave loads the international organization for standardization iso det norske veritas and germanischer lloyd dnv gl american petroleum institute api and korean register of shipping kr generally recommend a 100 year return period for the characteristic load of an offshore installation api 2007 dnv 2010 2011 sigurdsson 1996 iso 2007 kr 2012 the formula describing the interaction with the wind velocity is used to estimate the significant wave height h s as the wave data collected at the target location are insufficient wmo 1998 park et al 2013 the data related to the mean daily maximum wind velocity over the last 50 years are used to estimate the design wave height among the extreme distribution functions the gumbel distribution type i provides relatively conservative values and coincides with the actual measurement data of the wind velocity v at the target location lee et al 2010 eq 1 is the cumulative gumbel distribution function while the probability density function is its first derivative the terms a and b in eq 1 are the scale parameter and the location parameter respectively the two parameters are calculated based on the mean values 11 72 m s and the standard deviations 2 18 m s of the mean daily maximum wind velocity for a year at the target location fig 3 shows the probability density function and the cumulative distribution function with a 0 588 and b 10 739 1 f v exp exp a v b the return period t p is given by eq 2 based on the cumulative distribution function csa 1992 eq 3 is the interaction formula between the wind velocity v and h s wmo 1998 park et al 2013 the significant wave height h s corresponding to the 100 year return period can be computed based on eq 4 which is derived from eqs 1 3 2 t p 1 1 f v 3 h s t p 0 0246 v t p 2 4 h s t p 0 0246 1 a ln ln t p t p 1 b 2 2 3 2 structural design based on finite element analysis the value of h s of 8 48 m corresponds to the 100 year return period at the target location this wave height is used to calculate the wave excitation loads table 1 presents the expected forces and moments acting on the pile guided lng bt the wave excitation forces are calculated using ansys aqwa for the floating body the radiation wave induced by the movements of the floating body is also considered for the added mass and damping terms the force along the z direction is assumed to be zero as the pile guided lng bt exhibits only smooth heave motion along the guide piles lee et al 2016 in table 1 and x surge is the longitudinal direction y sway is the transverse direction z heave is the upward direction rx roll is the rotation about the x axis ry pitch is the rotation about the y axis and rz yaw is the rotation about the z axis the dimensions of the guide piles seabed truss structures and foundation piles are determined by fea the dimensions of the main components are used to estimate the initial investment of the mooring system for the cost benefit analysis in section 4 2 one of the most significant stresses in the structure is the bending stress at the guide piles arising from the horizontal wave loads in the y direction the piles and the seabed truss structures were modeled with the commercial fea code abaqus the floater was assumed to be a rigid body fig 4 shows the von mises stress of the structural components all the stresses are satisfied with the design criteria 3 motion study of the lng bt with the lngc and lng bs the sts availability of the lng bt with the lngc and the lng bs is the main issue because of the significant relative movements between the floating bodies the relative vertical motion of the lng bts with the lngc and the lng bs is studied to find the limit of the significant wave height the lng sts criteria are used to evaluate the operational availability of the pile guided lng bt the motion of a barge type lng bt is also analyzed to demonstrate that the availability of the pgf is greatly improved at reasonable extra costs this analysis disregards the friction between the guide piles and the floater an experimental approach is required for this issue in the future study 3 1 numerical approaches 3 1 1 hydrodynamic diffraction analysis the hydrodynamic diffraction analysis is performed for the floating bodies based on the source distribution method the mean wetted parts of the floaters are modeled using a number of panels the response amplitude operators raos for the hydrodynamic interacting structures are analyzed based on the equations of motion considering the changed diffraction and radiation forces eq 5 presents the total velocity potential φ that includes the incident potential the diffraction wave potential and the radiation potential induced by the rigid body motion of the floating bodies in the case of the multiple floater hydrodynamic interaction the total degrees of rigid body motion are 6 m where m is the number of

motion amplitude of m th structure x j m is the j th motion amplitude of the m th structure the velocity potential should be satisfied using the laplace equation free surface boundary condition linearized at z 0 body surface conditions seabed surface condition and far field radiation conditions ansys 2013 one of the difficulties faced is the fluid resonance phenomenon occurring in the gap between the floating bodies as the viscous flow effects are not considered when calculating diffraction and radiation in the ordinary potential theory ideal flow the external lid panels are defined on the mean free surface between the adjacent structures to avoid this phenomenon a damped free surface boundary is applied on the panels to suppress the unrealistic wave phenomena eq 6 expresses the modified free surface boundary conditions applied on the lid panels in the gap the term α d is the damping factor that is recommended to be between 0 and 0 2 while f 1 is a function that relates to

a p 3 1 2 hydrodynamic time response analysis the irregular wave responses with slow drift are analyzed to calculate the relative vertical motion of the adjacent floating bodies the linear response analysis of the floaters in the frequency domain is unsuitable for the sts motion analysis because of the nonlinearities including the drift forces and the fenders the impulse response function is used to describe the actual motion of the floaters eq 7 presents the basic convolution integral form for the motion analysis in the time domain cummins 1962 ogilvie 1964 7 m a x t b x t c k x t 0 t r

express the motion of the pile guided lng bt k is a symmetric diagonal matrix that physically represents the strong spring to restrict the five motions of the lng bt except for the heave the matrix k is zero for the barge type lng bt the irregular wave responses with slow drift are analyzed with respect to two types of the offshore lng bts with the lngc and the lng bs the pierson moskowitz spectra which represent the empirical relationship between energy distribution and wave frequency are adopted for the details of the irregular wave spectra ansys 2013 the mean zero crossing period t z is assumed to be from 10 s to 12 s for the analysis as the movements of the floaters are relatively sensitive to the long waves compared to the short waves ewans and jameson 2015 hagen et al 2015 pessoa et al 2016 the incoming waves directed from 45 to 45 with 15 increments are analyzed considering the target location and the position of the lng bt in fig 1 3 2 criterion for the lng ship to ship transfer several studies on the criteria required for the lng sts transfer have been conducted ewans and jameson 2015 considered the tug operability criteria for the availability of offloading the limiting values are 2 5 m for h s and 0 8 for the swell waves hagen et al 2015 estimated the sts criteria between two large floating bodies under the wind sea conditions of 2 5 3 m and the swell conditions of 1 m when h s is 1 5 m or higher a barge type lng bt cannot be operated without a particular mooring system because of the relative motions yun et al 2015 in this study allowance of the vertical relative motion for the lng loading arms is considered as the criterion because the acceptable wave height depends on the types of the floating bodies although special lng loading arms are being developed the relative movements of two floating bodies are significant for the sts transfer the demonstrated limitation of the vertical motion envelope is 2 0 m naciri et al 2007 van der valk et al 2004 the positions of the lng loading arms on the lng bt are shown in figs 5 and 10 three lng loading arms are designed on the lng bt when the lngc approaches the lng bt the lng loading arm i is employed to minimize the effects of the pitch motion of the floater the lng loading arms ii and iii are used for the transfer of lng to the lng bs the maximum relative motion in the vertical direction

transfer with the lng bt table 2 provides the main characteristics of the floaters the mass and the moment of inertia of the floaters are computed based on the dimensions in table 2 fig 5 shows the position between the lng bt and lngc considering 12 identical mooring lines and four fenders the lng loading arm i of the lng bt is used for lng transfer to the lngc figs 6 and 7 show a case of the heave pitch and roll motions of the two lng bts barge and pile guided with lngc for h s from 1 9 m to 3 7 m with increments of 0 2 m vertical motions are analyzed among the seven wave directions the 45 degree wave is the most significant for the floating bodies because of the large difference in the vertical motion fig 8 shows that 2 6 m is the limiting value of h s for the barge type lng bt and the lngc without any supporting structure when the pgf concept is applied the roll and pitch motions of the lng bt decrease significantly the motion of the lngc also decreases by the mooring lines with the pile guided lng bt additionally no noticeable relative motions of the two bodies were found up to h s 3 7 m as shown in fig 9 3 3 2 the lng bt and the lng bs the lng bs is another main vessel with access to the lng bt its length breadth and depth are stated in table 2 fig 10 shows the position for the lng sts operation between the lng bt and lng bs two lng bss can simultaneously approach one side of an lng bt in the case of operation with an lng bs more advantages of the pile guided lng bt are expected as the lng loading arms ii and iii of the lng bt are relatively far away from the center the relative vertical motions at the loading arms can be strongly affected by the pitch motion of the floater eight identical mooring lines and the three fenders are used for the sts transfer the actual responses of the two bodies in the time domain are studied following the same procedures as in section 3 3 1 figs 11 and 12 show a case of the heave pitch and roll motions of the two lng bts with lng bs analyses are performed considering h s from 0 7 m to 2 9 m with increments of 0 2 m among the seven wave directions the 30 and 15 wave directions are the most significant for the lng sts operation because of the difference between the roll and pitch motions when the guide piles support the lng bt the relative vertical motion at the loading arm decreases significantly fig 13 shows that h s 1 4 m is the limit of the significant wave height for the barge type lng bt and the lng bs without any particular positioning structure when the guide piles support the lng bt the roll and pitch motions are negligible the motion of the lng bs also decreases because of the mooring lines with the pile guided lng bt no significant relative motions of the floating bodies are found until h s is 2 5 m in fig 14 the operational availability of the lng bunkering system can be greatly improved as the criteria for the lng sts operation of the pile guided lng bt are increased from h s 1 4 m 2 5 m 4 results and discussion 4 1 operational availability of the lng bt the operational availability is a key factor contributing to the economic viability of a mooring system the sts availability of the lng bt and the lng bs is the main issue because their maximum relative vertical motion is relatively large because of the position of the lng loading arms ii and iii the acceptable operating wave conditions of the barge type lng bt and the pile guided lng bt are h s 1 4 m and h s 2 5 m respectively the monthly reports of marine data consisting of significant wave heights and directions are analyzed to evaluate the operational availability of the lng bunkering operation this study uses the wave data at the straits of korea which is the closest buoy from the target location the number of days unavailable for the lng sts transfer is presented in table 3 the operational availability is defined by the percentage of the number of lng sts operation days available fig 15 shows the availability of the two types of the lng bts the average availability of the barge type lng bt was 81 9 in 2014 and 80 0 in 2015 whereas that of the pile guided lng bt was 94 4 and 96 7 in the same years 4 2 cost benefit analysis a cost benefit analysis is conducted to verify whether the additional mooring structure is an economically feasible solution for an lng bt the cost includes the additional investment related to the guide piles the seabed truss structures and the foundation piles the benefit is the enhanced operational availability 4 2 1 cost the cost is the additional investment related to the positioning structures which is calculated based on the material usage eq 9 indicates the initial investment which is defined as the summation of the manufacturing cost c m transport cost c t and installation cost c i the coefficient a is obtained as 1 43 when c m is assumed to be approximately 70 of the initial investment lee et al 2016 9 c o s t c m c t c i a c m the weight and the steel usage are estimated from the dimensions of the main components of the positioning structures the diameters of the guide piles and seabed truss structures are designed to withstand the environmental loads acting on the floater as shown in table 4 the manufacturing costs of the guide piles and the foundation piles are assumed to be usd 2 495 the fabrication budget of the seabed truss structure is relatively high usd 4 990 per unit ton owing to its complexity de vries 2007 4 2 2 benefit the benefit is the increase in the operating profit between the barge type lng bt and the pile guided lng bt first the annual benefit b a is estimated by eq 10 based on the difference of the operational availability of lng transfer and then the present value of cumulative benefit b c can be calculated by eq 11 considering the discount rate in the two equations i indicates the month p is the operating profit of lng bunkering q is the mean daily demand of lng bunkering at the target port and b i is the number of increased days available for the lng sts transfer the terms j and d indicate the year and the discount rate respectively 10 b a i 1 12 p q b i 11 b c j 1 n b a 1 d 1 j the operating profit p is assumed to be 2 5 mmbtu 58 5 m3 as the lng import price and the lng retail price for bunkers in 2025 are expected to be 12 mmbtu and 14 5 mmbtu respectively sund and whitefield 2014 yun et al 2015 investigated the expected annual demand for lng bunkering table 5 shows the statistics of the ships visiting the busan port in 2011 only large oceangoing ships were considered for lng bunkering the ships with capacity less than 10 000 gross ton or fraction less than 5 were excluded fifteen per cent of all visiting ships were expected to be bunkered in the port with the fuel tanks filled from 10 to 85 by lng bunkering imo 2006 the estimated expected annual demands of lng bunkering in the port by yun et al 2015 are shown in table 6 it has been found that 1000 m3 of hfo and 1654 m3 of lng have the same energy density the mean daily demand of lng bunkering q is assumed to be 33 655 m3 per day based on the statistics and assumptions above finally the annual benefits from the improved operational availability can be calculated with results shown in table 7 4 2 3 economic feasibility of pile guide mooring system this study assesses the economic feasibility of the pile guide mooring system based on the cost benefit analysis the improved operational availability obtained using the pgf concept generates large profits compared to the extra costs of the mooring structures the mean value of the annual benefits b a in 2014 and 2015 is approximately 105 million usd per year the interest rates in the industrial countries are between 2 and 8 and d is often calculated based on the interest rates thoft christensen 2010 in this study 5 is used as the value of d to estimate the present value of the cumulative benefits the additional investment can be recovered within 1 year at the target location 30 m water depth the additional investment of the pile guide mooring system increases significantly with the water depth fig 16 shows the payback period for several values of the water depth the proposed mooring system for the offshore lng bt is applicable up to 100 m of the water depth 5 conclusions this study proposes the use of a pile guide mooring system for an offshore lng bt the economic benefit of the new mooring structure was confirmed based on the cost benefit analysis to demonstrate the economic feasibility of the newly developed mooring concept two types of lng bts were compared one was a typical barge type floater while the other was the proposed pgf the vicinity of the busan new port was selected as the target location of the lng bt first wave data near the port were used to compute the wave excitation forces acting on the floater the guide piles seabed truss structures and foundation piles were designed using fea to estimate the additional investment required the cost for the mooring structures increased significantly with the water depth second a motion study on two types of lng bts with the lngc and the lng bs was performed to find the limiting wave height for the lng sts operation the relative vertical motion between the lng loading arms was compared with the existing acceptance criteria the sts availability of the lng bt and the lng bs was the main issue as their maximum relative vertical motion was comparatively large because of the position of the lng loading arms and the size of the lng bs no significant relative motion of the pile guided lng bt with the lng bs was found until h s 2 5 m whereas the barge type lng bt could not be operated with h s 1 4 m the operational availability of the lng bt was improved from 80 to approximately 95 by applying the concept of the pgf finally a cost benefit analysis was conducted based on the additional investment and the improved availability the increased operational availability created large profits and the additional outlay of the supporting structures could be recovered within 1 year at the target location it was proved that the newly developed mooring concept for the offshore lng bt was economically feasible up to 100 m water depth in this study only two types of lng bts were compared other mooring systems should be considered in future studies in case of very swallow water 20 m a gravity based structure may be more reasonable than the pile guide mooring system when the water depth is significantly deep turret mooring systems are relatively cost effective a suitable mooring system depends on the environmental conditions of the target ports and the scale of lng bunkering after reviewing the initial investment and the operational availability of other mooring concepts in various ports and conditions the profitable application range of the pile guide mooring system should be reconsidered acknowledgements this

23511,this study proposes a pile guided floater a new mooring concept for large offshore floating structures such as an offshore liquefied natural gas lng bunkering terminal the economic feasibility of the new mooring system was demonstrated through a cost benefit analysis the environmental loads acting on the floaters were computed using wave data at the target location the mooring system was designed using finite element analysis to estimate the additional investment an lng ship to ship bunkering operation that included an lng bunkering terminal lng carrier lng bunkering shuttle and lng receiving ship was adopted to estimate the technical feasibility and economic benefit of the proposed mooring system the availabilities of two types of lng bunkering terminals were compared considering the acceptance criteria for lng ship to ship transfers one lng bunkering terminal was a typical barge type floater and the other was the pile guided floater the relative motion of the terminal with the lng carrier and the lng bunkering shuttle was analyzed the limiting wave height was determined from the maximum relative vertical motion between the floaters at the position of the lng loading arms the availability of the pile guided lng bunkering terminal was significantly improved owing to the reduced vertical motion finally a cost benefit analysis verified that the new mooring concept for an offshore lng bunkering terminal was economically feasible keywords operational availability lng ship to ship transfer lng bunkering system motion study pile guided floater 1 introduction the requirements and regulations concerning ship emissions are expected to be strengthened to protect the global environment the international maritime organization imo revised the marpol annex vi which consists of two standards for ship emissions the first standard is a global standard applied to all types of ships in signatory countries of the marpol treaty and the second standard pertains to emission control areas eca subject to rigorous limitations imo 2009 in addition to the regulations the marine environment protection committee mepc concluded at its 59th session in 2009 that an energy efficiency design index eedi for new ships was required the committee established an eedi formula to measure the co2 efficiency of new ships mepc 2009 devanney 2011 studied the impact of the eedi on very large crude carriers vlccs therein recommending that a newly developed vlcc should be designed to comply with the eedi formula to ensure that their co2 emissions could be reduced by 19 compared to the current design by 2013 by 36 by 2018 and by 47 by 2023 to meet these requirements liquefied natural gas lng is increasingly considered as an alternative fuel as it is environmentally friendly and cost effective for lng to be used as a marine fuel on a global scale various equipment and infrastructure including the volume efficient onboard lng storage tanks large size gas engines and lng bunkering facilities should be developed adachi et al 2014 proposed a concept of 9300 teu container ships fuelled by lng and performed an economic analysis to compare the concept for existing technologies for oil fuelled ships to comply with tier iii wang and notteboom 2014 reviewed several studies on the use of lng as a bunker for ship propulsion presented recent perspectives and challenges and suggested future studies by analyzing the limitations of the current studies economic feasibility safety and reliability are the key issues for the new lng technologies many studies have addressed fuel lng supply chains and related infrastructure from an economic perspective brett 2006 expected that lng would be used for a bunker in compliance with rigorous regulations of imo and investigated the lng market the current and potential fleet of lng fuelled marine vessels and the lng bunkering terminal lng bt many uncertainties can arise in a reliability analysis of a new technology komal et al 2015 estimated the fuzzy reliability of a dual fuel steam turbine propulsion system for lng carriers lngc using the proposed methodology to address uncertain data lng bunkering at ports is receiving increased attention from many interested parties including the port authorities lng distribution companies shipping companies and societies these parties will prefer to not only comply with the expected regulations but also reduce the cost of the supplied lng fuel for ships in safe and environmentally friendly manner according to the recent articles and reports although the market for lng bunkering has not been fully activated because of various uncertainties it is expected to grow stably up to 2020 the four types of lng bunkering approaches have been considered truck to ship tts port to ship pts portable tank transfer ptt and ship to ship sts currently tts and pts are generally employed however sts lng bunkering is attracting interest because of the limitations in terms of the size and sites of the other methods as the oceangoing ships continue to grow in size and the high complexity of the ship traffic near the main ports although the sts type of lng bunkering provides various benefits in terms of accessibility capacity improved safety space application in ports and initial investment it faces challenges related to the stability and operational availability of floating bodies during lng transfer choi 2014 to further consider the economic feasibility of the novel lng bt concept operational availability must be evaluated based on the motion study of the main floating bodies yun et al 2015 the relative movements of two floating bodies and availability are crucial issues for the lng sts operation recently several studies have been conducted on the side by side lng floating systems naciri et al 2007 performed time domain simulation between a floating lng flng and a vessel for side by side lng offloading bunnik 2014 also conducted a simulation of the large relative movements of multibody sts operations ewans and jameson 2015 evaluated the availability of offloading with respect to an lng barge where long term datasets of wave wind and current were used to estimate the availability the results and engineering criteria were compared for three locations nigeria the north west shelf of australia and the southern north sea the coupled motion responses of the lng floating systems were analyzed and the numerical and experimental results were compared for two cases one case was the motion study between two similar shuttle tankers and the other case considered a floating production storage and offloading system for lng flng with a shuttle tanker pessoa et al 2015 a procedure for computing the reliability of the offloading operation was studied two identical lngcs were considered as the case study limiting weather conditions were analyzed in compliance with failure probability criteria hagen et al 2015 pessoa et al 2016 performed a numerical and experimental study on the wave induced responses with respect to flng and shuttle tankers that were moored side by side the second order wave effects were considered for the coupled dynamic analysis the relative motions and loads on the mooring lines were considered in terms of the system operability mega scale floaters play a significant role in various lng supply chains an lng bt is a mega scale floater that contains many tanks for storing a large amount of lng many supporting and mooring technologies have been developed to support huge floaters although the jacket structure and jack up rig type are typical support structures they are inappropriate for an lng bt because of its enormous self weight the gravity based structure suffers from limitations in terms of economics sts transfer and soil conditions at target locations in the case of the spread mooring system the use of many cables obstructs the access by vessels thus these forms of mooring systems are unsuitable for an offshore lng bt lee et al 2016 introduced the pile guide mooring system for the lng bt and proposed a decision procedure for its target reliability from the whole life cycle cost perspective an offshore lng bt is a key infrastructure of the lng fuelled ships and the stable sts lng transfer is one of the most challenging issues this study designs a new mooring system for an offshore lng bt and evaluates the operational availability of the pile guided lng bt to quantify its economic advantages an lng bunkering system and the proposed mooring structure are described in section 2 the pile guide mooring system is designed by finite element analysis fea considering the wave excitation force in the target location in section 3 a motion study on two types of lng bts with an lngc and an lng bunkering shuttle lng bs is performed to determine the limiting wave height to evaluate the operational availability of the sts lng transfer section 4 compares the operational availability of the barge type lng bt and the pile guided lng bt finally a cost benefit analysis is conducted to show the economic feasibility of the novel mooring system for the offshore lng bt 2 system description 2 1 description of an offshore lng bunkering system fig 1 shows an lng sts bunkering chain the lngc facilitates long distance marine transportation of lng from a production plant to the lng bt the lng bt will be installed near busan new port the lng bt stores 300 000 m3 of imported lng and transfers it to the lng bss which transport the fuel to the lng receiving ships lng rs yun et al 2015 this study considers busan new port as the target port it is the largest harbor in south korea with a large number of visiting ships yun et al 2015 according to the busan port authority bpa there are various investment plans including the bunkering terminal this is an attempt to make the busan new port an international hub for the northeast asia the exact location and position of the lng bt are determined considering the wave height and direction the water depth at the lng bt area is approximately 30 m 2 2 concept of a pile guided floater for an lng bt lee et al 2016 introduced the concept of the pile guided floater pgf as an alternative technology for the mooring system of the lng bt fig 2 the pgf combines the advantages of the floating type and fixed type platforms a total of 14 vertical guide piles are used to support the floater taking into the account of the six lng storage tanks the guide piles are inserted into the pile housing the self weight of an lng bt is not applied to the support structures because the floater undergoes only heave motion along the guide piles the guide piles should endure the horizontal loads from an lng bt induced by waves or the forces of an lngc or lng bs when they approach the floater for sts operations the lng sts transfer can be satisfactorily accomplished with the guide piles and the seabed truss structures 2 3 design of the pile guide mooring system the weight of the lng bt which should have good accessibility for the ships for lng transfer is expected to be more than 200 000 tons designing a suitable mooring system within a reasonable cost is a key task for the lng bt this study designs the pile guide mooring system considering the environmental conditions at the target location fea is performed to determine the dimensions of the main parts of the mooring system 2 3 1 wave loads the international organization for standardization iso det norske veritas and germanischer lloyd dnv gl american petroleum institute api and korean register of shipping kr generally recommend a 100 year return period for the characteristic load of an offshore installation api 2007 dnv 2010 2011 sigurdsson 1996 iso 2007 kr 2012 the formula describing the interaction with the wind velocity is used to estimate the significant wave height h s as the wave data collected at the target location are insufficient wmo 1998 park et al 2013 the data related to the mean daily maximum wind velocity over the last 50 years are used to estimate the design wave height among the extreme distribution functions the gumbel distribution type i provides relatively conservative values and coincides with the actual measurement data of the wind velocity v at the target location lee et al 2010 eq 1 is the cumulative gumbel distribution function while the probability density function is its first derivative the terms a and b in eq 1 are the scale parameter and the location parameter respectively the two parameters are calculated based on the mean values 11 72 m s and the standard deviations 2 18 m s of the mean daily maximum wind velocity for a year at the target location fig 3 shows the probability density function and the cumulative distribution function with a 0 588 and b 10 739 1 f v exp exp a v b the return period t p is given by eq 2 based on the cumulative distribution function csa 1992 eq 3 is the interaction formula between the wind velocity v and h s wmo 1998 park et al 2013 the significant wave height h s corresponding to the 100 year return period can be computed based on eq 4 which is derived from eqs 1 3 2 t p 1 1 f v 3 h s t p 0 0246 v t p 2 4 h s t p 0 0246 1 a ln ln t p t p 1 b 2 2 3 2 structural design based on finite element analysis the value of h s of 8 48 m corresponds to the 100 year return period at the target location this wave height is used to calculate the wave excitation loads table 1 presents the expected forces and moments acting on the pile guided lng bt the wave excitation forces are calculated using ansys aqwa for the floating body the radiation wave induced by the movements of the floating body is also considered for the added mass and damping terms the force along the z direction is assumed to be zero as the pile guided lng bt exhibits only smooth heave motion along the guide piles lee et al 2016 in table 1 and x surge is the longitudinal direction y sway is the transverse direction z heave is the upward direction rx roll is the rotation about the x axis ry pitch is the rotation about the y axis and rz yaw is the rotation about the z axis the dimensions of the guide piles seabed truss structures and foundation piles are determined by fea the dimensions of the main components are used to estimate the initial investment of the mooring system for the cost benefit analysis in section 4 2 one of the most significant stresses in the structure is the bending stress at the guide piles arising from the horizontal wave loads in the y direction the piles and the seabed truss structures were modeled with the commercial fea code abaqus the floater was assumed to be a rigid body fig 4 shows the von mises stress of the structural components all the stresses are satisfied with the design criteria 3 motion study of the lng bt with the lngc and lng bs the sts availability of the lng bt with the lngc and the lng bs is the main issue because of the significant relative movements between the floating bodies the relative vertical motion of the lng bts with the lngc and the lng bs is studied to find the limit of the significant wave height the lng sts criteria are used to evaluate the operational availability of the pile guided lng bt the motion of a barge type lng bt is also analyzed to demonstrate that the availability of the pgf is greatly improved at reasonable extra costs this analysis disregards the friction between the guide piles and the floater an experimental approach is required for this issue in the future study 3 1 numerical approaches 3 1 1 hydrodynamic diffraction analysis the hydrodynamic diffraction analysis is performed for the floating bodies based on the source distribution method the mean wetted parts of the floaters are modeled using a number of panels the response amplitude operators raos for the hydrodynamic interacting structures are analyzed based on the equations of motion considering the changed diffraction and radiation forces eq 5 presents the total velocity potential φ that includes the incident potential the diffraction wave potential and the radiation potential induced by the rigid body motion of the floating bodies in the case of the multiple floater hydrodynamic interaction the total degrees of rigid body motion are 6 m where m is the number of floaters ansys 2013 5 φ x t a φ x e i ω t a φ i x φ d x m 1 m j 1 6 φ r j m x j m e i ω t in eq 5 φ x is the isolated space dependent term a is the incident wave amplitude ω is the wave frequency φ i is the first order incident wave potential with unit wave amplitude φ d is the corresponding diffraction wave potential φ r j m is the radiation wave potential because of the j th motion with unit motion amplitude of m th structure x j m is the j th motion amplitude of the m th structure the velocity potential should be satisfied using the laplace equation free surface boundary condition linearized at z 0 body surface conditions seabed surface condition and far field radiation conditions ansys 2013 one of the difficulties faced is the fluid resonance phenomenon occurring in the gap between the floating bodies as the viscous flow effects are not considered when calculating diffraction and radiation in the ordinary potential theory ideal flow the external lid panels are defined on the mean free surface between the adjacent structures to avoid this phenomenon a damped free surface boundary is applied on the panels to suppress the unrealistic wave phenomena eq 6 expresses the modified free surface boundary conditions applied on the lid panels in the gap the term α d is the damping factor that is recommended to be between 0 and 0 2 while f 1 is a function that relates to the gap size d g a p between two floating bodies cheetham et al 2007 6 ω 2 g α d 2 f 1 1 φ 2 i ω 2 g α d f 1 φ φ z 0 at z 0 f 1 sin 2 π 2 ω ω 0 w h e n ω ω 0 ω ω 0 2 w h e n ω ω 0 ω 0 max 0 1 π g d g a p 3 1 2 hydrodynamic time response analysis the irregular wave responses with slow drift are analyzed to calculate the relative vertical motion of the adjacent floating bodies the linear response analysis of the floaters in the frequency domain is unsuitable for the sts motion analysis because of the nonlinearities including the drift forces and the fenders the impulse response function is used to describe the actual motion of the floaters eq 7 presents the basic convolution integral form for the motion analysis in the time domain cummins 1962 ogilvie 1964 7 m a x t b x t c k x t 0 t r

express the motion of the pile guided lng bt k is a symmetric diagonal matrix that physically represents the strong spring to restrict the five motions of the lng bt except for the heave the matrix k is zero for the barge type lng bt the irregular wave responses with slow drift are analyzed with respect to two types of the offshore lng bts with the lngc and the lng bs the pierson moskowitz spectra which represent the empirical relationship between energy distribution and wave frequency are adopted for the details of the irregular wave spectra ansys 2013 the mean zero crossing period t z is assumed to be from 10 s to 12 s for the analysis as the movements of the floaters are relatively sensitive to the long waves compared to the short waves ewans and jameson 2015 hagen et al 2015 pessoa et al 2016 the incoming waves directed from 45 to 45 with 15 increments are analyzed considering the target location and the position of the lng bt in fig 1 3 2 criterion for the lng ship to ship transfer several studies on the criteria required for the lng sts transfer have been conducted ewans and jameson 2015 considered the tug operability criteria for the availability of offloading the limiting values are 2 5 m for h s and 0 8 for the swell waves hagen et al 2015 estimated the sts criteria between two large floating bodies under the wind sea conditions of 2 5 3 m and the swell conditions of 1 m when h s is 1 5 m or higher a barge type lng bt cannot be operated without a particular mooring system because of the relative motions yun et al 2015 in this study allowance of the vertical relative motion for the lng loading arms is considered as the criterion because the acceptable wave height depends on the types of the floating bodies although special lng loading arms are being developed the relative movements of two floating bodies are significant for the sts transfer the demonstrated limitation of the vertical motion envelope is 2 0 m naciri et al 2007 van der valk et al 2004 the positions of the lng loading arms on the lng bt are shown in figs 5 and 10 three lng loading arms are designed on the lng bt when the lngc approaches the lng bt the lng loading arm i is employed to minimize the effects of the pitch motion of the floater the lng loading arms ii and iii are used for the transfer of lng to the lng bs the maximum relative motion in the vertical direction

transfer with the lng bt table 2 provides the main characteristics of the floaters the mass and the moment of inertia of the floaters are computed based on the dimensions in table 2 fig 5 shows the position between the lng bt and lngc considering 12 identical mooring lines and four fenders the lng loading arm i of the lng bt is used for lng transfer to the lngc figs 6 and 7 show a case of the heave pitch and roll motions of the two lng bts barge and pile guided with lngc for h s from 1 9 m to 3 7 m with increments of 0 2 m vertical motions are analyzed among the seven wave directions the 45 degree wave is the most significant for the floating bodies because of the large difference in the vertical motion fig 8 shows that 2 6 m is the limiting value of h s for the barge type lng bt and the lngc without any supporting structure when the pgf concept is applied the roll and pitch motions of the lng bt decrease significantly the motion of the lngc also decreases by the mooring lines with the pile guided lng bt additionally no noticeable relative motions of the two bodies were found up to h s 3 7 m as shown in fig 9 3 3 2 the lng bt and the lng bs the lng bs is another main vessel with access to the lng bt its length breadth and depth are stated in table 2 fig 10 shows the position for the lng sts operation between the lng bt and lng bs two lng bss can simultaneously approach one side of an lng bt in the case of operation with an lng bs more advantages of the pile guided lng bt are expected as the lng loading arms ii and iii of the lng bt are relatively far away from the center the relative vertical motions at the loading arms can be strongly affected by the pitch motion of the floater eight identical mooring lines and the three fenders are used for the sts transfer the actual responses of the two bodies in the time domain are studied following the same procedures as in section 3 3 1 figs 11 and 12 show a case of the heave pitch and roll motions of the two lng bts with lng bs analyses are performed considering h s from 0 7 m to 2 9 m with increments of 0 2 m among the seven wave directions the 30 and 15 wave directions are the most significant for the lng sts operation because of the difference between the roll and pitch motions when the guide piles support the lng bt the relative vertical motion at the loading arm decreases significantly fig 13 shows that h s 1 4 m is the limit of the significant wave height for the barge type lng bt and the lng bs without any particular positioning structure when the guide piles support the lng bt the roll and pitch motions are negligible the motion of the lng bs also decreases because of the mooring lines with the pile guided lng bt no significant relative motions of the floating bodies are found until h s is 2 5 m in fig 14 the operational availability of the lng bunkering system can be greatly improved as the criteria for the lng sts operation of the pile guided lng bt are increased from h s 1 4 m 2 5 m 4 results and discussion 4 1 operational availability of the lng bt the operational availability is a key factor contributing to the economic viability of a mooring system the sts availability of the lng bt and the lng bs is the main issue because their maximum relative vertical motion is relatively large because of the position of the lng loading arms ii and iii the acceptable operating wave conditions of the barge type lng bt and the pile guided lng bt are h s 1 4 m and h s 2 5 m respectively the monthly reports of marine data consisting of significant wave heights and directions are analyzed to evaluate the operational availability of the lng bunkering operation this study uses the wave data at the straits of korea which is the closest buoy from the target location the number of days unavailable for the lng sts transfer is presented in table 3 the operational availability is defined by the percentage of the number of lng sts operation days available fig 15 shows the availability of the two types of the lng bts the average availability of the barge type lng bt was 81 9 in 2014 and 80 0 in 2015 whereas that of the pile guided lng bt was 94 4 and 96 7 in the same years 4 2 cost benefit analysis a cost benefit analysis is conducted to verify whether the additional mooring structure is an economically feasible solution for an lng bt the cost includes the additional investment related to the guide piles the seabed truss structures and the foundation piles the benefit is the enhanced operational availability 4 2 1 cost the cost is the additional investment related to the positioning structures which is calculated based on the material usage eq 9 indicates the initial investment which is defined as the summation of the manufacturing cost c m transport cost c t and installation cost c i the coefficient a is obtained as 1 43 when c m is assumed to be approximately 70 of the initial investment lee et al 2016 9 c o s t c m c t c i a c m the weight and the steel usage are estimated from the dimensions of the main components of the positioning structures the diameters of the guide piles and seabed truss structures are designed to withstand the environmental loads acting on the floater as shown in table 4 the manufacturing costs of the guide piles and the foundation piles are assumed to be usd 2 495 the fabrication budget of the seabed truss structure is relatively high usd 4 990 per unit ton owing to its complexity de vries 2007 4 2 2 benefit the benefit is the increase in the operating profit between the barge type lng bt and the pile guided lng bt first the annual benefit b a is estimated by eq 10 based on the difference of the operational availability of lng transfer and then the present value of cumulative benefit b c can be calculated by eq 11 considering the discount rate in the two equations i indicates the month p is the operating profit of lng bunkering q is the mean daily demand of lng bunkering at the target port and b i is the number of increased days available for the lng sts transfer the terms j and d indicate the year and the discount rate respectively 10 b a i 1 12 p q b i 11 b c j 1 n b a 1 d 1 j the operating profit p is assumed to be 2 5 mmbtu 58 5 m3 as the lng import price and the lng retail price for bunkers in 2025 are expected to be 12 mmbtu and 14 5 mmbtu respectively sund and whitefield 2014 yun et al 2015 investigated the expected annual demand for lng bunkering table 5 shows the statistics of the ships visiting the busan port in 2011 only large oceangoing ships were considered for lng bunkering the ships with capacity less than 10 000 gross ton or fraction less than 5 were excluded fifteen per cent of all visiting ships were expected to be bunkered in the port with the fuel tanks filled from 10 to 85 by lng bunkering imo 2006 the estimated expected annual demands of lng bunkering in the port by yun et al 2015 are shown in table 6 it has been found that 1000 m3 of hfo and 1654 m3 of lng have the same energy density the mean daily demand of lng bunkering q is assumed to be 33 655 m3 per day based on the statistics and assumptions above finally the annual benefits from the improved operational availability can be calculated with results shown in table 7 4 2 3 economic feasibility of pile guide mooring system this study assesses the economic feasibility of the pile guide mooring system based on the cost benefit analysis the improved operational availability obtained using the pgf concept generates large profits compared to the extra costs of the mooring structures the mean value of the annual benefits b a in 2014 and 2015 is approximately 105 million usd per year the interest rates in the industrial countries are between 2 and 8 and d is often calculated based on the interest rates thoft christensen 2010 in this study 5 is used as the value of d to estimate the present value of the cumulative benefits the additional investment can be recovered within 1 year at the target location 30 m water depth the additional investment of the pile guide mooring system increases significantly with the water depth fig 16 shows the payback period for several values of the water depth the proposed mooring system for the offshore lng bt is applicable up to 100 m of the water depth 5 conclusions this study proposes the use of a pile guide mooring system for an offshore lng bt the economic benefit of the new mooring structure was confirmed based on the cost benefit analysis to demonstrate the economic feasibility of the newly developed mooring concept two types of lng bts were compared one was a typical barge type floater while the other was the proposed pgf the vicinity of the busan new port was selected as the target location of the lng bt first wave data near the port were used to compute the wave excitation forces acting on the floater the guide piles seabed truss structures and foundation piles were designed using fea to estimate the additional investment required the cost for the mooring structures increased significantly with the water depth second a motion study on two types of lng bts with the lngc and the lng bs was performed to find the limiting wave height for the lng sts operation the relative vertical motion between the lng loading arms was compared with the existing acceptance criteria the sts availability of the lng bt and the lng bs was the main issue as their maximum relative vertical motion was comparatively large because of the position of the lng loading arms and the size of the lng bs no significant relative motion of the pile guided lng bt with the lng bs was found until h s 2 5 m whereas the barge type lng bt could not be operated with h s 1 4 m the operational availability of the lng bt was improved from 80 to approximately 95 by applying the concept of the pgf finally a cost benefit analysis was conducted based on the additional investment and the improved availability the increased operational availability created large profits and the additional outlay of the supporting structures could be recovered within 1 year at the target location it was proved that the newly developed mooring concept for the offshore lng bt was economically feasible up to 100 m water depth in this study only two types of lng bts were compared other mooring systems should be considered in future studies in case of very swallow water 20 m a gravity based structure may be more reasonable than the pile guide mooring system when the water depth is significantly deep turret mooring systems are relatively cost effective a suitable mooring system depends on the environmental conditions of the target ports and the scale of lng bunkering after reviewing the initial investment and the operational availability of other mooring concepts in various ports and conditions the profitable application range of the pile guide mooring system should be reconsidered acknowledgements this

aeration τ i e the close time of the air gun the utilization efficiency of the gas inside the air gun chamber η the heat transfer coefficient α and other key parameters of the air gun are employed to control the motion of the bubble in the simulation of a single air gun bubble with buoyancy the vortex ring model is used to simulate the motion of the toroidal bubble after jet impacts and it is extended to the multiple vortex rings in the simulation of the interaction between two clustered air gun bubbles some new findings are summarized as follows i under the effect of the buoyancy the shape of the bubble becomes non spherical at later phase of bubble collapse but the deformation seems to have little effect on the far field pressure ii for the clustered air gun bubbles the primary

therefore sound waves especially with high frequencies such as ultrasonic waves are commonly used to detect the objects on or under the water surface including other vessels and submarines besides sound waves also play important roles in marine prospecting but usually the frequencies of the sound waves are relatively low to improve their penetration among kinds of seismic sources the most widely used ones are seismic air guns which can produce relative good low frequency acoustic signals sound waves as air guns fire sound waves are emitted to the water almost at once and a part of them will penetrate the inner structure of the seabed and a part of them will be reflected to the free surface at the surface of different medias according to the reflected waves recorded by receivers at the sea surface and the reflection characteristics of sound waves between different medias we then can get the comprehensible information about the subsurface caldwell and dragoset 2000 the sound wave acts like a bright lamp illuminating the inner structure of the earth except for the enough low frequency components the sound waves are often required to have enough energy to meet the deep vertical penetration and far horizontal propagation caldwell and dragoset 2000 to improve the detection resolution of the sources a large number of numerical studies on air guns have been done ziolkowski 1970 built the first physical model of the air gun with the spherical bubble model proposed by gilmore 1952 due to the wavelength of pressure wavelet was quite long as compared with bubble radius the non spherical deformation of the bubble was ignored in the calculation of the fluid pressure at the far field observation point other researchers later made a series of modifications to ziolkowski s model including the bubble aeration landrø and sollie 1992 the heat transfer between bubble and its surrounding water landrø and sollie 1992 li et al 2010 the viscosity effect langhammer and landrø 1993a the temperature effect langhammer and landrø 1993b the vertical rise of bubble li et al 2010 and damping factors graaf et al 2014c langhammer et al 1995 etc based on the approximation of giles and johnston 1973 ziolkowski et al 1982 extended the theory of a single air gun to an air gun array each bubble in the array was assumed as a source point and oscillated in a pressure field caused by the other bubbles this method is quite effective in the calculation of the far field pressure generated by the air gun array without clustered guns but for the array with clustered guns laws et al 1990 li et al 2011 strandenes and vaage 1992 especially when the maximum radius of one bubble exceeds the standoff distance between two bubbles the center of one bubble may become a point of another which may lead to the divergent of the pressure and calculation termination in fact the interaction between two small spaced bubbles is complicated and often accompanied by the occurrence of tear and fusion however clustered air guns are commonly used for improving the primary to bubble pulse ratio of the signal in engineering and so finding a way to calculate the fluid pressure caused by the clustered air guns is quite meaningful recently some countries attempted to use the pressure waves generated by the air guns to the shock testing naval ships the fluid pressure at the near field observation point becomes one of the worth studying topic air gun bubbles observed in the experiments are usually non spherical graaf et al 2014a b langhammer and landrø 1996 on the influence of the buoyancy the free surface or the air gun body etc such as the bubble generated by the four openings air gun four distinct bubbles are developed from the jets of air released through the four openings of the air gun and they eventually merge together with the oscillation of the bubble graaf et al 2014a b if we continue use the spherical bubble model to calculate the fluid pressure near the bubble the results will be largely inconsistent with the real situation in this paper boundary integral method bim is applied to simulate the non spherical motion of the air gun bubble although bim is not predominant in the simulation of bubble fusion and tear as compared with finite volume method fvm it can accurately capture the boundary of the bubble surface and easily obtain the pressure at the far field such as 9000 m far away from the bubble with bim non uniform fluid pressure surrounding bubble is successfully calculated and the divergence in the simulation of the clustered air gun bubbles is overcome in section 2 we introduce the basic theory of bim and air gun in section 3 we compare the far filed pressure calculated by different methods at first and then we investigate the time variation of the potential energy and kinetic energy etc good agreement of the pressure is found between bim and the spherical bubble model the bubble aeration and heat loss considered in bim generally satisfy the law of conservation of energy in section 4 we firstly investigate the effect of the bubble buoyancy to the fluid pressure at the far field observation point after that we study the motion of two clustered air gun bubbles with the model of the multiple vortex ring zhang et al 2015 motion of the bubble after jet penetrates is also simulated through the analysis of the effect of the non dimensional distance between two bubbles a critical value 1 6 is found at which primary to bubble pulse ratio pb will reach a maximum then we investigate the interaction between the bubble and the free surface for the deformation of the free surface is not what we cared about the image method is adopted in this paper with this method the interaction between the bubble and free surface is equivalent to the interaction between the bubble and its image finally the motion of the bubble under the effect of the air gun body is studied 2 basic theory 2 1 basic theory of bim the viscosity effects on air gun signature was studied experimentally in langhammer and landrø 1993a it was found that the overall effect of the increasing the viscosity from 6 to 723 cp was surprisingly small and they eventually concluded that viscosity was not one of the main energy loss mechanisms in air gun bubble dynamics at 20 c the viscosity coefficient of water is about 1 01 cp so it may not cause big differences to our results when the viscosity is ignored bornhorst and hatsopoulos 1967 graaf et al 2014a the compressibility is ignored for the motion speed of the air gun bubble dr dt is quite small as compared with the sound speed c most of the time at the end of the bubble collapse phase the motion speed of bubble may enlarge especially when the high speed liquid jet is formed inside the bubble and compressibility may become significant but only for a minuscule time duration as pointed out by wang et al 1996a b compressibility may have certain effect on the bubble pulse but the influence won t be too large therefore the fluid is modeled by considering the fluid to be incompressible inviscid and irrotational in this paper the velocity can be expressed as the gradient of a potential ϕ blake and gibson 1981 blake et al 1986 1 1 u ϕ 2 ϕ 0 the solution of the laplace equation is obtained using a boundary integral method newman 1977 1 2 λ p ϕ p s ϕ q n g p q g p q n ϕ q d s where λ p is the solid angle of fixed point p q is the integration point on the boundary and n is the unit normal vector of the boundary in respect to green function g p q it satisfies 1 3 g p q 1 p q equation 1 2 reflects the relation between ϕ and normal velocity ϕ n and both two parameters are only related to the spatial coordinates the tangent velocity ϕ τ can be obtained by the finite differential method where τ is the unit tangent vector of the boundary the boundary of the fluid of can be updated by taib 1985 zhang et al 2015 1 4 u ϕ n n ϕ τ τ d r d t ϕ can be updated by the unsteady bernoulli equation zhang and liu 2015 1 5 d ϕ d t ϕ 2 2 g z p b p ρ where ρ is the density of the liquid p is the hydrostatic pressure at infinity z is the coordinate in the vertical direction and p b is the pressure exerted at the inside surface of the bubble to improve the calculation accuracy a two stage runge kutta method is introduced to update the velocity potential ϕ if δt denotes the time step ϕ t δt then can be expressed as 1 6 ϕ t δ t ϕ t δ t 1 2 ϕ t δ t 2 2 g z t δ t 2 p b t δ t 2 p ρ to ensure the stability of the mesh wang et al 1996a put forward a formula on time step δt controlling the motion speed of the mesh by the changes of the potential as shown in equation 1 7 the displacement of a node within a time step can t exceed the length of the minimal mesh when the velocity of the node on the fluid boundary is large δt will diminish otherwise the contrary wang et al 1996b 1 7 δ t min δ ϕ max d ϕ d t l min ϕ where δϕ is a constant and l min is the minimum length of the grid 2 2 basic theory of air gun fig 1 shows the basic working principle of a typical air gun the chamber of the air gun is divided into two parts by the shuttle the lower one is the main chamber and the upper one is the firing chamber initially the solenoid valve is close and gas is continuously injected into the firing chamber from the upper entrance under the pressure difference between the firing chamber and main chamber the shuttle moves towards the main chamber and will eventually block the openings of the air gun as shown in fig 1 a after the firing chamber and the main chamber are full of the gas the solenoid valve then will be opened the gas inside the firing chamber is released and leads to the unbalance of pressure between the main chamber and the firing chamber the shuttle is pushed upward and the gas is ejected from the main chamber into the fluid initial bubble is formed with a radius r 0 and inner pressure p 0 as shown in fig 1 b at t τ 0 the time length of the bubble aeration the solenoid valve is closed again the pressure inside the firing chamber increases and the shuttle is push back to the initial position with the openings of the air gun blocked when t τ 0 bubble will oscillate without the control of the air gun the time variation of the mass of the gas inside the bubble was regarded as a function of the area of the openings by dragoset 1984 landrø and sollie 1992 proposed a linear model and the model was verified by his experiments in this paper the linear model is adopted but a new parameter η is employed to describe the utilization efficiency of gas inside the air gun η is equal to 1 m r m g where m g is the mass of the gas inside the initial air gun t 0 and m r is the mass of the residual gas inside the air gun chamber t τ 0 the velocity of the gas transferred from the air gun chamber to the bubble is then expressed as 1 8 d m d t η m g τ 0 f o r t τ 0 d m d t 0 f o r t τ 0 the transfer of the air from air gun to the bubble is assumed as a quasi static thermodynamic process landrø and sollie 1992 which satisfies the second law of thermodynamics through simple math formulation derivation zhang et al 2017 the temperature of the gas inside the bubble t b then can be expressed as 1 9 d t b d t c p t g c v t b d m d t p b d v b d t d q d t m b c v f o r t τ 0 where c p and c v are the specific heat capacity at constant volume and pressure c p c v r g respectively r g is the ideal gas constant 8 314 t g is the temperature of the gas inside the air gun v b is the bubble volume p b is the inner pressure of the gas inside the bubble and m b is the mass of the air inside the bubble due to the long period of air gun bubble in the order of hundred milliseconds the heat transfer between the bubble and the surrounding fluid q can t be ignored in landrø and sollie 1992 dq dt was set to be zero for t τ 0 an equivalent specific heat capacity c v eff 12 r g was utilized to replace c v in the denominator of equation 1 9 to compensate the heat loss of the bubble during the bubble aeration in his model the temperature difference between the gas inside the air gun t g and the bubble t b was not considered for t τ 0 dq dt is thought to be proportional to the area of the bubble surface 1 10 d q d t α s b where s b is the area of the bubble surface and α is the heat transfer coefficient of the gas between the bubble and the surrounding fluid according to state equation of the ideal gas the inner pressure of the gas inside the bubble satisfied the below equation 1 11 p b r g m b t b v b due to the primary pulse of the pressure wavelet is very sensitive to the time variation time step during bubble aeration need to be further reduced combined with the time step chosen in bim new time step during bubble aeration is then expressed as 1 12 δ t min δ ϕ max d ϕ d t l min ϕ δ m d m d t where δm is a constant and set to be 1 100 of the initial mass of the gas inside the bubble in this paper 2 3 vortex ring model the vortex ring model proposed by wang et al 1996a is used when the jet penetrates the bubble wall after a simple treatment to the topology of the bubble bubble is changed from singly connected to doubly connected the velocity potential is no longer a single valued function of the spatial coordinates a velocity loop is thought to be formed around the toroidal bubble with the distribution of a vortex ring inside the bubble the velocity potential ϕ is deposed into the induced potential of the vortex ring ϕ i and the remnant potential ϕ r in the like manger the fluid velocity then can be expressed as u u i u r where u i is the velocity induced by the vortex ring and u r is the remnant velocity ϕ r can be obtained from boundary integral function 1 2 and ϕ i can be calculated by the law of biot savart 1 13 δ ϕ i γ 4 π c r d l r 3 where c is the closed vortex ring γ is the circulation of the vortex ring and r is the position vector at any point in the fluid the vortex ring at a point p can be calculated by 1 14 ϕ i p 0 0 p ϕ i e z d r z γ 4 π c r z r 1 1 r r e z r d l where r z is the vertical component of the position vector r and ϕ i is equal to zero at infinity on basis of a single vortex ring model wang et al 1996a 2005 zhang et al 2015 put forward a multiple vortex ring model which is used to simulate the motion of a troidal bubble above a solid boundary in his model the vortex ring was distributed inside each of the bubble the velocity potential was decomposed into 3 parts i e ϕ ϕ i1 ϕ i2 ϕ r where ϕ i1 and ϕ i2 were the potential induced by the vortex ring of bubble 1 and bubble 2 respectively 2 4 discrete of air gun body the boundary of the fluid consists of the outer surface of bubble and solid boundary of the air gun body due to a part of the surface of the bubble is within the launching room of the air gun without contacting with the fluid this part is omitted the outer surface of the bubble is discretized into 32 linear elements consisting of 33 nodes for the boundary of the air gun the number of the discrete element is not a constant it is changed along with the expansion and contraction of the bubble the nodes on the solid boundary is indeed an interpolated function of the changing distance between two adjacent nodes on the bubble surface to keep the length of the element on the bubble and solid boundary at the same order of the magnitude then the discrete equation of the bim equation is transformed as followed the original discrete matrix is 1 15 g s 1 s 1 g s 1 b g s 1 s 2 g b s 1 g b b g b s 1 g s 2 s 1 g s 2 b g s 2 s 2 ϕ n s 1 ϕ n b ϕ n s 2 h s 1 s 1 h s 1 b h s 1 s 2 h b s 1 h b b h b s 1 h s 2 s 1 h s 2 b h s 2 s 2 ϕ s 1 ϕ b ϕ s 2 the subscript b denotes the bubble s1 and s2 denote the upper and lower solid boundary of the air gun respectively g is the discrete matrix of h is the discrete matrix of 1 r n d r ϕ n b and ϕ n s are the normal velocity of the bubble and the solid boundary respectively ϕ b and ϕ s are the potential of the bubble and solid boundary respectively due to ϕ n s is equal to zero equation 1 15 can be further simplified the processing of the nodes on intersection of the bubble and solid boundary is complex for gas solid and liquid coexist at these points corner points for the nodes on the solid boundary they need to meet the boundary condition of neumann i e their normal velocities are zeros for the nodes on the bubble surface they need to meet the boundary condition of dirichelet ϕ x x t that means both neumann and dirichelet boundary condition need to be satisfied at the corner points in this paper the corner points are regard as the nodes of the bubble surface but the velocity components along the normal of the solid boundary are set to be zero 2 5 model verification to verify the bim model in this paper a case under the following conditions is taken as an example the initial volume of the gas inside the air gun v g 300 in3 491 6 cm3 the initial inner pressure of the air gun p g 2000 psi 13 8 mpa the firing depth of the air gun h 6 m the time length of bubble aeration τ 0 5 89 ms the utilization efficiency of gas inside the air gun η 73 22 the heat transfer coefficient α 6000 j k mol initial radius of the bubble r 0 3v g 4π 1 3 the atmosphere pressure p atm 105 pa and the initial pressure inside the bubble p 0 p combined with the basic theory of air gun in section 2 2 bim and model of rayleigh 1917 are used to simulate the motion of the air gun bubble respectively the effect of the buoyancy is not considered and bubble remains spherical in shape all the time the bubble radius and fluid pressure at the far field observation point 9000 m below the bubble calculated by two methods are compared in fig 2 and good agreements of the bubble radius and far field pressure are found the small differences may be caused by the discrete time and bubble boundary which can be further reduced by the utilization of the smaller time step and more dense mesh of bubble boundary in fig 2 the reduction of the bubble radius in the second cycle is mainly caused by the heat transfer between the bubble and the surrounding water to verify the law of the energy conversation of bim the time variation of the kinetic energy e k the potential energy e p and total energy e total during the bubble oscillation are plotted in fig 3 the kinetic energy e k of the fluid is calculated from blake and gibson 1981 and it is as follows 1 16 e k ρ 2 ϕ ϕ n d s the potential energy e p is calculated by 1 17 e p p v b ρ g v b z c 5 2 m b r g t b q where v b m b and t b are the volume mass and temperature of the gas inside the bubble respectively z c is the height of the centroid of the bubble and q is the heat transfer between the bubble and the surrounding water the total energy e total is equal to e p e k for t τ 0 the total energy is increased linearly with the air transferred from the air gun chamber to the bubble for t τ 0 the total energy remains at a constant due to the closure of the air gun 3 results and discussion 3 1 single air gun bubble in fig 4 the time variation of the bubble volume and the fluid pressure at far field observation point 9000 m below the bubble are compared in which the blue solid line is calculated with the buoyancy effect considered δ 0 2 and the red dotted line is calculated without buoyancy δ 0 the buoyancy parameter is δ ρ g r m δ p where δ p is the reference pressure approximating to the hydrostatic pressure in the undisturbed liquid although bubble becomes non spherical in shape under the effect of buoyancy the bubble volume and far field pressure are still very close to the results of the case without buoyancy it re verifies the correctness of the spherical model landrø 1994 ziolkowski 1970 i e the deformation of the bubble can be roughly ignored in the calculation of the far field pressure in the design of the air gun both τ and η are key parameters need to be considered fig 5 shows the comparisons of the fluid pressure at far field observation point under different τ and η with the increase of η the bubble period the primary pulse and the bubble pulse are all increased but with the increase of τ primary pulse and bubble pulse are both reduced and it seems to have no effect on the bubble period therefore to improve the performance of the air gun it is required to increase the utilization efficiency of the gas in the air gun η and reduce the time length of bubble aeration τ in the air gun design 3 2 clustered air gun bubbles the study on the interaction between two air gun bubbles is of great significance in the exploration of the marine resources clustered air guns are often used to improve the primary to bubble pulse ratio of the pressure wavelet a critical distance is believed to be existed between the two air gun bubbles at which bubble pulse of the pressure wave can be effectively suppressed and meanwhile primary pulse is not largely reduced the study of the critical distance is quite meaningful to guide the distribution of the multi air gun array in engineering it is helpful to produce a high quality far field pressure wavelet which has a better detecting resolution and penetration although there have been many papers on the interaction between two bubbles nowadays most of them are based on the problem of underwater explosion bubble and more attentions are paid on the formation of the jet and the damage of structure in this paper we combine the basic theory of the air gun and boundary integral method bim to simulate the motion of the air gun bubble in our model the discharge process of the air gun and the mass and heat transfer are taken into consideration the basic theory of the air gun was put forward very early but they were mainly used in the spherical air gun bubble model which ignored the effect of the air gun body and buoyancy effect it seems to be the first time the basic theory of the air gun is used in the model of the bim different from the previous studies on the underwater explosion bubbles in this paper attentions are mainly focused on the variation of bubble pulse and bubble period etc with the increase of the distance between two air gun bubbles in this section the interactions between two clustered air gun bubbles under different standoff distances d are investigated and 3 typical cases are displayed in fig 6 the initial conditions of each bubble are consistent with fig 2 when d is small for example d 0 5 m a thin water film will be firstly formed between two bubbles with two bubbles close to each other the thickness of the water film becomes thinner and thinner when the thickness is less than 1 4 length of the element of bubble t 50 62 ms two bubbles are merged by the simple topology treatment han et al 2015 2016 the newly formed bubble continues to collapse with two opposite vertical jets formed inside the bubble at t 143 25 ms two jets collide and bubble appears toroidal bubble then continues to collapse in a toroidal form until bubble reaches a minimum t 157 42 ms as the standoff distance between two bubbles d is increased to 1 0 m two bubbles are very close at their maximum volume t 71 96 ms but merge is not happened for the thickness of water film is still larger than 1 4 length of the element at the later phase of bubble collapse a downward jet is formed from the top of the upper bubble and an upward jet is formed from the bottom of the lower bubble two jet penetrates the surface of each bubble almost at the same time t 140 18 ms and two single connected bubbles become two toroidal bubbles t 141 56 ms to simulate the subsequent motion of the bubble the theory of multiple vortex ring model proposed by zhang et al 2015 is employed as d further increases d 1 5 m two opposite protrusions are formed during the second expansion of the bubble fig 7 shows the time variation of the volume of the lower bubble and the fluid pressure at far field observation point 9000 m below the bubble with the increase of the standoff distance d both the period and the volume of the bubble are reduced this is due to each bubble located in a pressure filed caused by the other one and the pressure is negative in most of the time for the case with a smaller d the pulsation resistance of the bubble is also smaller so bubble can expand to a large volume as shown in the left picture of fig 7 for the bubble pulse of far field pressure it is not a monotonous function of d first reduces then increases a critical value for d may exist at which bubble pulse will reach a minimum to find a best coherent distance that main pulse and the primary to bubble ratio can reach the maximum ursin 1978 a non dimensional analysis is made in fig 8 the abscissa is taken as d r max where r max is the maximum radius of single bubble 0 66 m as seen in the left picture of fig 2 the non dimensional primary pulse primary to bubble ratio and bubble period are taken as ordinates which are scaled by 79 69 bar m 1 59 and 121 8 ms respectively the above characteristic parameters are obtained from the two times pressure of single bubble as seen in the right picture of fig 7 with the increase of d r max the non dimensional primary pulse is gradually increased to 1 0 and in contrast the bubble period is gradually reduced to 1 0 however for the non dimensional primary to bubble pulse ratio it increases first then reduces a maximum value seems to be appeared at about d r max 1 6 3 3 effect of the free surface to make the pressure pulse excited by the air gun have a good detecting effect it is necessary to sink the air gun to the best depth if the air gun is placed too shallow a part of the energy will be converted to the broken energy of the sea surface which reduces the effective energy of the primary pulse however if the air gun is placed too deep the pressure of the liquid around the air gun will be relative large the highly compressed gas inside the air gun will be released at a lower speed resulting in the broadening of the pressure pulse the narrowing of the frequency band and the enlarging resistance of bubble pulsation fig 9 shows the evolutions of the bubbles under the influence of the free surface at various h the vertical distance from bubble center to the free surface because the changes of the free surface morphology are not what we care about an image method is adopted here with this method the interaction between the bubble and free surface is converted to the interaction between the bubble and its image at the free surface for h 1 0 m bubble is repelled by the free surface forming a downward jet inside the bubble at the phase of bubble collapse blake et al 1987 chahine 1977 pearson et al 2004 robinson et al 2001 zhang et al 2016 at t 146 02 ms the downward jet penetrates the lower surface of the bubble accompanied by the formation of a long protrusion li et al 2012 wang et al 1996a zhang and liu 2015 as h increases to 1 5 m the effect of the free surface is further weakened the shape of the bubble almost remains spherical for the absence of the buoyancy a thinner and longer protrusion is formed inside the bubble as compared with the case h 1 0 m t 212 98 and 233 85 ms the fluid pressure at the far field observation point 9000 m below the bubble is shown in the left picture of fig 10 the pressure wavelet is indeed a superposition of the pressure caused by the bubble and its image at the free surface and a time delay is existed the time delay is usually approximated to 2h c where c is the sound velocity in the seawater 1500 m s as seen in the figure the firing depth of the air gun seems to have little effect on the primary pulse but have a significant influence on the bubble pulse and bubble period the primary to bubble pulse ratio seems to be larger at a smaller h so the firing depth of the air gun may set to be as small as possible on the premise of the air gun not above the water surface to improve the detection resolution of signal we will next make an analysis from the normalized amplitude spectrum that generated from the pressure wavelets the most distinctive feature is the reduction of the frequency that ghost notch happens as seen in the right picture of fig 10 the reason is explained as the following if the directive pressure wavelet is denoted by f t the total pressure wavelet at far field observation point then can be roughly expressed as f t f t δt where δt is the time delay stated above 2h c let w f be the spectrum function corresponding to f t the spectrum of the total pressure wavelet can be written as w f 1 ei 2πf δt the ghost notch happens at f 1 δt c 2h and the frequency of ghost notch is inversely proportional to h for example when firing depth of the air gun h is 9 m the frequency of ghost notch has already less than 100 hz leading to the effective bandwidth greatly reduced 3 4 effect of the air gun body air gun body is simplified to two rigid cylinders as seen in fig 11 the model of the air gun used in this paper is axisymmetric which is used to simulate the motion of the bubble generated by an air gun with an annular opening like the commonly used sleeve gun whose annular opening is arranged in the middle of the gun body which can effectively reduce the vibration and impact caused by the firing of the air gun the axisymmetric model may not be used to simulate the air gun with four openings directly but at the late stage of the bubble expansion four small bubbles ejected from four openings will be merged into one large annular bubble which still looks very similar in shape with the results calculated from our axisymmetric model to convenient to compare with the experiments in appendix initial parameters of the air gun are set to be as follows τ 0 η 1 α 0 v g 17 12 mm3 and p g 1200 psi as seen in the figure bubble is flattened slightly during bubble expansion the horizontal radius of the bubble reaches a maximum at t 1 05 ms in the final stage of the bubble collapse high pressure regions are formed on the left and right sides of the bubble t 2 15 ms under the effect of the high pressure two opposite horizontal jets perpendicular to the cylinders are formed inside the bubble at about t 2 21 ms two jets collide at the axis of bubble central and bubble is split into two parts the initial calculation of the numerical simulation is started when bubble overflows from the gap of the two cylinders which may be the main cause of the difference in bubble period between the results of numerical simulation and spark bubble experiment in fig 12 the diameter of two cylinders d is reduced to 6 mm the initial volume of the bubble is kept the same as the last case d 8 mm through the adjustment of the distance between two cylinders the motion of the bubble is basically similar with that in fig 11 for quantitative analysis the time variation of the bubble volume and the pressure of a measure point 0 5 m from the bubble are displayed in fig 13 with the increase of the diameter of two cylinders the maximum volume of the bubble enlarges and bubble period decreases for the calculation is terminated when jet penetrates the bubble bubble pulse may not reach the maximum but the formation of the bubble pulse is slightly earlier when the diameter of the cylinder is larger 4 conclusions in this paper the motion of the non spherical air gun bubble is investigated with the boundary integral method bim in combination with the basic theory of the air gun the non spherical air gun model is roughly verified through the comparisons with the spherical bubble model we systematically investigated the motion of the air gun bubble with buoyancy the motion of the clustered air gun bubbles and the motion of the bubble under the effect of the free surface and the air gun body several new findings are summarized as followed i the non spherical deformation of the air gun bubble seems to have little effect on the far field pressure wavelet including the primary pulse the bubble pulse and the bubble period in the air gun s original design and manufacture the increase of the utilization efficiency of the gas in the air gun η and the reduction of the time length of bubble aeration τ is helpful to improve the performance of the air gun ii for the clustered air gun bubbles both the period and the volume of the bubble are reduced as compared with single air gun bubble can expand to a larger volume at a smaller standoff distance d between two bubbles the primary to bubble pulse ratio will reach a maximum when the standoff distance d is about 1 6 times maximum radius of single bubble iii for the effect of the free surface primary to bubble pulse ratio is relative large at a small firing depth of the air gun h the firing depth of the air gun may set to be as small as possible on the premise of the air gun not above the water surface acknowledgement this work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 11672082 11672081 the authors are grateful to ms yang hui and mr ye yalong for the great help they have provided us in the experiment appendix a low voltage electric spark bubble generating method is adopted in this paper the same with the references cui et al 2013 yang 2015 zhang et al 2013 the high speed camera on the one side of the tank is photographed at a rate of 15000 frames s 1 illuminated by a 2 kw backlight on the opposite side of the tank the simple circuit of the bubble generator consists of a 6600 μf capacitor and a 200 v dc power supply two thin copper wires are taken as the electrodes with the discharge of the capacitor the copper wires are ignited into bright plasma and a bubble is generated all the experiments are conducted at room temperature and atmospheric pressure the maximum horizontal radius of the bubble is about 12 mm the motion of spark bubble in the gap between two cylinders with different diameters d is shown in fig 14 and fig 15 which provides a rough reference for the numerical study notably the bubble period may be prolonged by the combustion of copper wire electrodes in the formation of sparking bubbles which may also be one of the reasons for the difference in the bubble period of numerical results for d 8 mm bubble expands rapidly along the horizontal direction in the gap of two cylinders at initial stage when bubble overflows from the gap of the two cylinders motion of the bubble surface is accelerated in the vertical direction and bubble surface is obviously not smooth during the collapse of the bubble two opposite jets perpendicular to the solid wall of the cylinder are formed driven by two opposite jets the middle part of the bubble becomes thinner and thinner two opposite jets eventually make a collision at the bubble central axis and bubble splits into two parts the upper and lower bubble then rebound and slide along the rigid boundary of the cylinder fig 15 shows the motion of the spark bubble in the gap between two cylinders with a diameter of 6 mm which looks very similar to that in fig 14 d 8 mm the bubble volume is not easy to measure in the experiment but bubble period is increased obviously when d is reduced from 8mm to 6 mm

shape of the bubble becomes non spherical at later phase of bubble collapse but the deformation seems to have little effect on the far field pressure ii for the clustered air gun bubbles the primary to bubble pulse ratio will reach a maximum when the standoff distance d is about 1 6 times maximum radius of a single bubble iii primary to bubble pulse ratio is relative large at a small firing depth of the air gun h the vertical distance from the bubble center to the free surface 1 introduction as a mechanical wave sound waves decay slowly in the seawater as compared to electromagnetic waves therefore sound waves especially with high frequencies such as ultrasonic waves are commonly used to detect the objects on or under the water surface including other vessels and submarines besides sound waves also play important roles in marine prospecting but usually the frequencies of the sound waves are relatively low to improve their penetration among kinds of seismic sources the most widely used ones are seismic air guns which can produce relative good low frequency acoustic signals sound waves as air guns fire sound waves are emitted to the water almost at once and a part of them will penetrate the inner structure of the seabed and a part of them will be reflected to the free surface at the surface of different medias according to the reflected waves recorded by receivers at the sea surface and the reflection characteristics of sound waves between different medias we then can get the comprehensible information about the subsurface caldwell and dragoset 2000 the sound wave acts like a bright lamp illuminating the inner structure of the earth except for the enough low frequency components the sound waves are often required to have enough energy to meet the deep vertical penetration and far horizontal propagation caldwell and dragoset 2000 to improve the detection resolution of the sources a large number of numerical studies on air guns have been done ziolkowski 1970 built the first physical model of the air gun with the spherical bubble model proposed by gilmore 1952 due to the wavelength of pressure wavelet was quite long as compared with bubble radius the non spherical deformation of the bubble was ignored in the calculation of the fluid pressure at the far field observation point other researchers later made a series of modifications to ziolkowski s model including the bubble aeration landrø and sollie 1992 the heat transfer between bubble and its surrounding water landrø and sollie 1992 li et al 2010 the viscosity effect langhammer and landrø 1993a the temperature effect langhammer and landrø 1993b the vertical rise of bubble li et al 2010 and damping factors graaf et al 2014c langhammer et al 1995 etc based on the approximation of giles and johnston 1973 ziolkowski et al 1982 extended the theory of a single air gun to an air gun array each bubble in the array was assumed as a source point and oscillated in a pressure field caused by the other bubbles this method is quite effective in the calculation of the far field pressure generated by the air gun array without clustered guns but for the array with clustered guns laws et al 1990 li et al 2011 strandenes and vaage 1992 especially when the maximum radius of one bubble exceeds the standoff distance between two bubbles the center of one bubble may become a point of another which may lead to the divergent of the pressure and calculation termination in fact the interaction between two small spaced bubbles is complicated and often accompanied by the occurrence of tear and fusion however clustered air guns are commonly used for improving the primary to bubble pulse ratio of the signal in engineering and so finding a way to calculate the fluid pressure caused by the clustered air guns is quite meaningful recently some countries attempted to use the pressure waves generated by the air guns to the shock testing naval ships the fluid pressure at the near field observation point becomes one of the worth studying topic air gun bubbles observed in the experiments are usually non spherical graaf et al 2014a b langhammer and landrø 1996 on the influence of the buoyancy the free surface or the air gun body etc such as the bubble generated by the four openings air gun four distinct bubbles are developed from the jets of air released through the four openings of the air gun and they eventually merge together with the oscillation of the bubble graaf et al 2014a b if we continue use the spherical bubble model to calculate the fluid pressure near the bubble the results will be largely inconsistent with the real situation in this paper boundary integral method bim is applied to simulate the non spherical motion of the air gun bubble although bim is not predominant in the simulation of bubble fusion and tear as compared with finite volume method fvm it can accurately capture the boundary of the bubble surface and easily obtain the pressure at the far field such as 9000 m far away from the bubble with bim non uniform fluid pressure surrounding bubble is successfully calculated and the divergence in the simulation of the clustered air gun bubbles is overcome in section 2 we introduce the basic theory of bim and air gun in section 3 we compare the far filed pressure calculated by different methods at first and then we investigate the time variation of the potential energy and kinetic energy etc good agreement of the pressure is found between bim and the spherical bubble model the bubble aeration and heat loss considered in bim generally satisfy the law of conservation of energy in section 4 we firstly investigate the effect of the bubble buoyancy to the fluid pressure at the far field observation point after that we study the motion of two clustered air gun bubbles with the model of the multiple vortex ring zhang et al 2015 motion of the bubble after jet penetrates is also simulated through the analysis of the effect of the non dimensional distance between two bubbles a critical value 1 6 is found at which primary to bubble pulse ratio pb will reach a maximum then we investigate the interaction between the bubble and the free surface for the deformation of the free surface is not what we cared about the image method is adopted in this paper with this method the interaction between the bubble and free surface is equivalent to the interaction between the bubble and its image finally the motion of the bubble under the effect of the air gun body is studied 2 basic theory 2 1 basic theory of bim the viscosity effects on air gun signature was studied experimentally in langhammer and landrø 1993a it was found that the overall effect of the increasing the viscosity from 6 to 723 cp was surprisingly small and they eventually concluded that viscosity was not one of the main energy loss mechanisms in air gun bubble dynamics at 20 c the viscosity coefficient of water is about 1 01 cp so it may not cause big differences to our results when the viscosity is ignored bornhorst and hatsopoulos 1967 graaf et al 2014a the compressibility is ignored for the motion speed of the air gun bubble dr dt is quite small as compared with the sound speed c most of the time at the end of the bubble collapse phase the motion speed of bubble may enlarge especially when the high speed liquid jet is formed inside the bubble and compressibility may become significant but only for a minuscule time duration as pointed out by wang et al 1996a b compressibility may have certain effect on the bubble pulse but the influence won t be too large therefore the fluid is modeled by considering the fluid to be incompressible inviscid and irrotational in this paper the velocity can be expressed as the gradient of a potential ϕ blake and gibson 1981 blake et al 1986 1 1 u ϕ 2 ϕ 0 the solution of the laplace equation is obtained using a boundary integral method newman 1977 1 2 λ p ϕ p s ϕ q n g p q g p q n ϕ q d s where λ p is the solid angle of fixed point p q is the integration point on the boundary and n is the unit normal vector of the boundary in respect to green function g p q it satisfies 1 3 g p q 1 p q equation 1 2 reflects the relation between ϕ and normal velocity ϕ n and both two parameters are only related to the spatial coordinates the tangent velocity ϕ τ can be obtained by the finite differential method where τ is the unit tangent vector of the boundary the boundary of the fluid of can be updated by taib 1985 zhang et al 2015 1 4 u ϕ n n ϕ τ τ d r d t ϕ can be updated by the unsteady bernoulli equation zhang and liu 2015 1 5 d ϕ d t ϕ 2 2 g z p b p ρ where ρ is the density of the liquid p is the hydrostatic pressure at infinity z is the coordinate in the vertical direction and p b is the pressure exerted at the inside surface of the bubble to improve the calculation accuracy a two stage runge kutta method is introduced to update the velocity potential ϕ if δt denotes the time step ϕ t δt then can be expressed as 1 6 ϕ t δ t ϕ t δ t 1 2 ϕ t δ t 2 2 g z t δ t 2 p b t δ t 2 p ρ to ensure the stability of the mesh wang et al 1996a put forward a formula on time step δt controlling the motion speed of the mesh by the changes of the potential as shown in equation 1 7 the displacement of a node within a time step can t exceed the length of the minimal mesh when the velocity of the node on the fluid boundary is large δt will diminish otherwise the contrary wang et al 1996b 1 7 δ t min δ ϕ max d ϕ d t l min ϕ where δϕ is a constant and l min is the minimum length of the grid 2 2 basic theory of air gun fig 1 shows the basic working principle of a typical air gun the chamber of the air gun is divided into two parts by the shuttle the lower one is the main chamber and the upper one is the firing chamber initially the solenoid valve is close and gas is continuously injected into the firing chamber from the upper entrance under the pressure difference between the firing chamber and main chamber the shuttle moves towards the main chamber and will eventually block the openings of the air gun as shown in fig 1 a after the firing chamber and the main chamber are full of the gas the solenoid valve then will be opened the gas inside the firing chamber is released and leads to the unbalance of pressure between the main chamber and the firing chamber the shuttle is pushed upward and the gas is ejected from the main chamber into the fluid initial bubble is formed with a radius r 0 and inner pressure p 0 as shown in fig 1 b at t τ 0 the time length of the bubble aeration the solenoid valve is closed again the pressure inside the firing chamber increases and the shuttle is push back to the initial position with the openings of the air gun blocked when t τ 0 bubble will oscillate without the control of the air gun the time variation of the mass of the gas inside the bubble was regarded as a function of the area of the openings by dragoset 1984 landrø and sollie 1992 proposed a linear model and the model was verified by his experiments in this paper the linear model is adopted but a new parameter η is employed to describe the utilization efficiency of gas inside the air gun η is equal to 1 m r m g where m g is the mass of the gas inside the initial air gun t 0 and m r is the mass of the residual gas inside the air gun chamber t τ 0 the velocity of the gas transferred from the air gun chamber to the bubble is then expressed as 1 8 d m d t η m g τ 0 f o r t τ 0 d m d t 0 f o r t τ 0 the transfer of the air from air gun to the bubble is assumed as a quasi static thermodynamic process landrø and sollie 1992 which satisfies the second law of thermodynamics through simple math formulation derivation zhang et al 2017 the temperature of the gas inside the bubble t b then can be expressed as 1 9 d t b d t c p t g c v t b d m d t p b d v b d t d q d t m b c v f o r t τ 0 where c p and c v are the specific heat capacity at constant volume and pressure c p c v r g respectively r g is the ideal gas constant 8 314 t g is the temperature of the gas inside the air gun v b is the bubble volume p b is the inner pressure of the gas inside the bubble and m b is the mass of the air inside the bubble due to the long period of air gun bubble in the order of hundred milliseconds the heat transfer between the bubble and the surrounding fluid q can t be ignored in landrø and sollie 1992 dq dt was set to be zero for t τ 0 an equivalent specific heat capacity c v eff 12 r g was utilized to replace c v in the denominator of equation 1 9 to compensate the heat loss of the bubble during the bubble aeration in his model the temperature difference between the gas inside the air gun t g and the bubble t b was not considered for t τ 0 dq dt is thought to be proportional to the area of the bubble surface 1 10 d q d t α s b where s b is the area of the bubble surface and α is the heat transfer coefficient of the gas between the bubble and the surrounding fluid according to state equation of the ideal gas the inner pressure of the gas inside the bubble satisfied the below equation 1 11 p b r g m b t b v b due to the primary pulse of the pressure wavelet is very sensitive to the time variation time step during bubble aeration need to be further reduced combined with the time step chosen in bim new time step during bubble aeration is then expressed as 1 12 δ t min δ ϕ max d ϕ d t l min ϕ δ m d m d t where δm is a constant and set to be 1 100 of the initial mass of the gas inside the bubble in this paper 2 3 vortex ring model the vortex ring model proposed by wang et al 1996a is used when the jet penetrates the bubble wall after a simple treatment to the topology of the bubble bubble is changed from singly connected to doubly connected the velocity potential is no longer a single valued function of the spatial coordinates a velocity loop is thought to be formed around the toroidal bubble with the distribution of a vortex ring inside the bubble the velocity potential ϕ is deposed into the induced potential of the vortex ring ϕ i and the remnant potential ϕ r in the like manger the fluid velocity then can be expressed as u u i u r where u i is the velocity induced by the vortex ring and u r is the remnant velocity ϕ r can be obtained from boundary integral function 1 2 and ϕ i can be calculated by the law of biot savart 1 13 δ ϕ i γ 4 π c r d l r 3 where c is the closed vortex ring γ is the circulation of the vortex ring and r is the position vector at any point in the fluid the vortex ring at a point p can be calculated by 1 14 ϕ i p 0 0 p ϕ i e z d r z γ 4 π c r z r 1 1 r r e z r d l where r z is the vertical component of the position vector r and ϕ i is equal to zero at infinity on basis of a single vortex ring model wang et al 1996a 2005 zhang et al 2015 put forward a multiple vortex ring model which is used to simulate the motion of a troidal bubble above a solid boundary in his model the vortex ring was distributed inside each of the bubble the velocity potential was decomposed into 3 parts i e ϕ ϕ i1 ϕ i2 ϕ r where ϕ i1 and ϕ i2 were the potential induced by the vortex ring of bubble 1 and bubble 2 respectively 2 4 discrete of air gun body the boundary of the fluid consists of the outer surface of bubble and solid boundary of the air gun body due to a part of the surface of the bubble is within the launching room of the air gun without contacting with the fluid this part is omitted the outer surface of the bubble is discretized into 32 linear elements consisting of 33 nodes for the boundary of the air gun the number of the discrete element is not a constant it is changed along with the expansion and contraction of the bubble the nodes on the solid boundary is indeed an interpolated function of the changing distance between two adjacent nodes on the bubble surface to keep the length of the element on the bubble and solid boundary at the same order of the magnitude then the discrete equation of the bim equation is transformed as followed the original discrete matrix is 1 15 g s 1 s 1 g s 1 b g s 1 s 2 g b s 1 g b b g b s 1 g s 2 s 1 g s 2 b g s 2 s 2 ϕ n s 1 ϕ n b ϕ n s 2 h s 1 s 1 h s 1 b h s 1 s 2 h b s 1 h b b h b s 1 h s 2 s 1 h s 2 b h s 2 s 2 ϕ s 1 ϕ b ϕ s 2 the subscript b denotes the bubble s1 and s2 denote the upper and lower solid boundary of the air gun respectively g is the discrete matrix of h is the discrete matrix of 1 r n d r ϕ n b and ϕ n s are the normal velocity of the bubble and the solid boundary respectively ϕ b and ϕ s are the potential of the bubble and solid boundary respectively due to ϕ n s is equal to zero equation 1 15 can be further simplified the processing of the nodes on intersection of the bubble and solid boundary is complex for gas solid and liquid coexist at these points corner points for the nodes on the solid boundary they need to meet the boundary condition of neumann i e their normal velocities are zeros for the nodes on the bubble surface they need to meet the boundary condition of dirichelet ϕ x x t that means both neumann and dirichelet boundary condition need to be satisfied at the corner points in this paper the corner points are regard as the nodes of the bubble surface but the velocity components along the normal of the solid boundary are set to be zero 2 5 model verification to verify the bim model in this paper a case under the following conditions is taken as an example the initial volume of the gas inside the air gun v g 300 in3 491 6 cm3 the initial inner pressure of the air gun p g 2000 psi 13 8 mpa the firing depth of the air gun h 6 m the time length of bubble aeration τ 0 5 89 ms the utilization efficiency of gas inside the air gun η 73 22 the heat transfer coefficient α 6000 j k mol initial radius of the bubble r 0 3v g 4π 1 3 the atmosphere pressure p atm 105 pa and the initial pressure inside the bubble p 0 p combined with the basic theory of air gun in section 2 2 bim and model of rayleigh 1917 are used to simulate the motion of the air gun bubble respectively the effect of the buoyancy is not considered and bubble remains spherical in shape all the time the bubble radius and fluid pressure at the far field observation point 9000 m below the bubble calculated by two methods are compared in fig 2 and good agreements of the bubble radius and far field pressure are found the small differences may be caused by the discrete time and bubble boundary which can be further reduced by the utilization of the smaller time step and more dense mesh of bubble boundary in fig 2 the reduction of the bubble radius in the second cycle is mainly caused by the heat transfer between the bubble and the surrounding water to verify the law of the energy conversation of bim the time variation of the kinetic energy e k the potential energy e p and total energy e total during the bubble oscillation are plotted in fig 3 the kinetic energy e k of the fluid is calculated from blake and gibson 1981 and it is as follows 1 16 e k ρ 2 ϕ ϕ n d s the potential energy e p is calculated by 1 17 e p p v b ρ g v b z c 5 2 m b r g t b q where v b m b and t b are the volume mass and temperature of the gas inside the bubble respectively z c is the height of the centroid of the bubble and q is the heat transfer between the bubble and the surrounding water the total energy e total is equal to e p e k for t τ 0 the total energy is increased linearly with the air transferred from the air gun chamber to the bubble for t τ 0 the total energy remains at a constant due to the closure of the air gun 3 results and discussion 3 1 single air gun bubble in fig 4 the time variation of the bubble volume and the fluid pressure at far field observation point 9000 m below the bubble are compared in which the blue solid line is calculated with the buoyancy effect considered δ 0 2 and the red dotted line is calculated without buoyancy δ 0 the buoyancy parameter is δ ρ g r m δ p where δ p is the reference pressure approximating to the hydrostatic pressure in the undisturbed liquid although bubble becomes non spherical in shape under the effect of buoyancy the bubble volume and far field pressure are still very close to the results of the case without buoyancy it re verifies the correctness of the spherical model landrø 1994 ziolkowski 1970 i e the deformation of the bubble can be roughly ignored in the calculation of the far field pressure in the design of the air gun both τ and η are key parameters need to be considered fig 5 shows the comparisons of the fluid pressure at far field observation point under different τ and η with the increase of η the bubble period the primary pulse and the bubble pulse are all increased but with the increase of τ primary pulse and bubble pulse are both reduced and it seems to have no effect on the bubble period therefore to improve the performance of the air gun it is required to increase the utilization efficiency of the gas in the air gun η and reduce the time length of bubble aeration τ in the air gun design 3 2 clustered air gun bubbles the study on the interaction between two air gun bubbles is of great significance in the exploration of the marine resources clustered air guns are often used to improve the primary to bubble pulse ratio of the pressure wavelet a critical distance is believed to be existed between the two air gun bubbles at which bubble pulse of the pressure wave can be effectively suppressed and meanwhile primary pulse is not largely reduced the study of the critical distance is quite meaningful to guide the distribution of the multi air gun array in engineering it is helpful to produce a high quality far field pressure wavelet which has a better detecting resolution and penetration although there have been many papers on the interaction between two bubbles nowadays most of them are based on the problem of underwater explosion bubble and more attentions are paid on the formation of the jet and the damage of structure in this paper we combine the basic theory of the air gun and boundary integral method bim to simulate the motion of the air gun bubble in our model the discharge process of the air gun and the mass and heat transfer are taken into consideration the basic theory of the air gun was put forward very early but they were mainly used in the spherical air gun bubble model which ignored the effect of the air gun body and buoyancy effect it seems to be the first time the basic theory of the air gun is used in the model of the bim different from the previous studies on the underwater explosion bubbles in this paper attentions are mainly focused on the variation of bubble pulse and bubble period etc with the increase of the distance between two air gun bubbles in this section the interactions between two clustered air gun bubbles under different standoff distances d are investigated and 3 typical cases are displayed in fig 6 the initial conditions of each bubble are consistent with fig 2 when d is small for example d 0 5 m a thin water film will be firstly formed between two bubbles with two bubbles close to each other the thickness of the water film becomes thinner and thinner when the thickness is less than 1 4 length of the element of bubble t 50 62 ms two bubbles are merged by the simple topology treatment han et al 2015 2016 the newly formed bubble continues to collapse with two opposite vertical jets formed inside the bubble at t 143 25 ms two jets collide and bubble appears toroidal bubble then continues to collapse in a toroidal form until bubble reaches a minimum t 157 42 ms as the standoff distance between two bubbles d is increased to 1 0 m two bubbles are very close at their maximum volume t 71 96 ms but merge is not happened for the thickness of water film is still larger than 1 4 length of the element at the later phase of bubble collapse a downward jet is formed from the top of the upper bubble and an upward jet is formed from the bottom of the lower bubble two jet penetrates the surface of each bubble almost at the same time t 140 18 ms and two single connected bubbles become two toroidal bubbles t 141 56 ms to simulate the subsequent motion of the bubble the theory of multiple vortex ring model proposed by zhang et al 2015 is employed as d further increases d 1 5 m two opposite protrusions are formed during the second expansion of the bubble fig 7 shows the time variation of the volume of the lower bubble and the fluid pressure at far field observation point 9000 m below the bubble with the increase of the standoff distance d both the period and the volume of the bubble are reduced this is due to each bubble located in a pressure filed caused by the other one and the pressure is negative in most of the time for the case with a smaller d the pulsation resistance of the bubble is also smaller so bubble can expand to a large volume as shown in the left picture of fig 7 for the bubble pulse of far field pressure it is not a monotonous function of d first reduces then increases a critical value for d may exist at which bubble pulse will reach a minimum to find a best coherent distance that main pulse and the primary to bubble ratio can reach the maximum ursin 1978 a non dimensional analysis is made in fig 8 the abscissa is taken as d r max where r max is the maximum radius of single bubble 0 66 m as seen in the left picture of fig 2 the non dimensional primary pulse primary to bubble ratio and bubble period are taken as ordinates which are scaled by 79 69 bar m 1 59 and 121 8 ms respectively the above characteristic parameters are obtained from the two times pressure of single bubble as seen in the right picture of fig 7 with the increase of d r max the non dimensional primary pulse is gradually increased to 1 0 and in contrast the bubble period is gradually reduced to 1 0 however for the non dimensional primary to bubble pulse ratio it increases first then reduces a maximum value seems to be appeared at about d r max 1 6 3 3 effect of the free surface to make the pressure pulse excited by the air gun have a good detecting effect it is necessary to sink the air gun to the best depth if the air gun is placed too shallow a part of the energy will be converted to the broken energy of the sea surface which reduces the effective energy of the primary pulse however if the air gun is placed too deep the pressure of the liquid around the air gun will be relative large the highly compressed gas inside the air gun will be released at a lower speed resulting in the broadening of the pressure pulse the narrowing of the frequency band and the enlarging resistance of bubble pulsation fig 9 shows the evolutions of the bubbles under the influence of the free surface at various h the vertical distance from bubble center to the free surface because the changes of the free surface morphology are not what we care about an image method is adopted here with this method the interaction between the bubble and free surface is converted to the interaction between the bubble and its image at the free surface for h 1 0 m bubble is repelled by the free surface forming a downward jet inside the bubble at the phase of bubble collapse blake et al 1987 chahine 1977 pearson et al 2004 robinson et al 2001 zhang et al 2016 at t 146 02 ms the downward jet penetrates the lower surface of the bubble accompanied by the formation of a long protrusion li et al 2012 wang et al 1996a zhang and liu 2015 as h increases to 1 5 m the effect of the free surface is further weakened the shape of the bubble almost remains spherical for the absence of the buoyancy a thinner and longer protrusion is formed inside the bubble as compared with the case h 1 0 m t 212 98 and 233 85 ms the fluid pressure at the far field observation point 9000 m below the bubble is shown in the left picture of fig 10 the pressure wavelet is indeed a superposition of the pressure caused by the bubble and its image at the free surface and a time delay is existed the time delay is usually approximated to 2h c where c is the sound velocity in the seawater 1500 m s as seen in the figure the firing depth of the air gun seems to have little effect on the primary pulse but have a significant influence on the bubble pulse and bubble period the primary to bubble pulse ratio seems to be larger at a smaller h so the firing depth of the air gun may set to be as small as possible on the premise of the air gun not above the water surface to improve the detection resolution of signal we will next make an analysis from the normalized amplitude spectrum that generated from the pressure wavelets the most distinctive feature is the reduction of the frequency that ghost notch happens as seen in the right picture of fig 10 the reason is explained as the following if the directive pressure wavelet is denoted by f t the total pressure wavelet at far field observation point then can be roughly expressed as f t f t δt where δt is the time delay stated above 2h c let w f be the spectrum function corresponding to f t the spectrum of the total pressure wavelet can be written as w f 1 ei 2πf δt the ghost notch happens at f 1 δt c 2h and the frequency of ghost notch is inversely proportional to h for example when firing depth of the air gun h is 9 m the frequency of ghost notch has already less than 100 hz leading to the effective bandwidth greatly reduced 3 4 effect of the air gun body air gun body is simplified to two rigid cylinders as seen in fig 11 the model of the air gun used in this paper is axisymmetric which is used to simulate the motion of the bubble generated by an air gun with an annular opening like the commonly used sleeve gun whose annular opening is arranged in the middle of the gun body which can effectively reduce the vibration and impact caused by the firing of the air gun the axisymmetric model may not be used to simulate the air gun with four openings directly but at the late stage of the bubble expansion four small bubbles ejected from four openings will be merged into one large annular bubble which still looks very similar in shape with the results calculated from our axisymmetric model to convenient to compare with the experiments in appendix initial parameters of the air gun are set to be as follows τ 0 η 1 α 0 v g 17 12 mm3 and p g 1200 psi as seen in the figure bubble is flattened slightly during bubble expansion the horizontal radius of the bubble reaches a maximum at t 1 05 ms in the final stage of the bubble collapse high pressure regions are formed on the left and right sides of the bubble t 2 15 ms under the effect of the high pressure two opposite horizontal jets perpendicular to the cylinders are formed inside the bubble at about t 2 21 ms two jets collide at the axis of bubble central and bubble is split into two parts the initial calculation of the numerical simulation is started when bubble overflows from the gap of the two cylinders which may be the main cause of the difference in bubble period between the results of numerical simulation and spark bubble experiment in fig 12 the diameter of two cylinders d is reduced to 6 mm the initial volume of the bubble is kept the same as the last case d 8 mm through the adjustment of the distance between two cylinders the motion of the bubble is basically similar with that in fig 11 for quantitative analysis the time variation of the bubble volume and the pressure of a measure point 0 5 m from the bubble are displayed in fig 13 with the increase of the diameter of two cylinders the maximum volume of the bubble enlarges and bubble period decreases for the calculation is terminated when jet penetrates the bubble bubble pulse may not reach the maximum but the formation of the bubble pulse is slightly earlier when the diameter of the cylinder is larger 4 conclusions in this paper the motion of the non spherical air gun bubble is investigated with the boundary integral method bim in combination with the basic theory of the air gun the non spherical air gun model is roughly verified through the comparisons with the spherical bubble model we systematically investigated the motion of the air gun bubble with buoyancy the motion of the clustered air gun bubbles and the motion of the bubble under the effect of the free surface and the air gun body several new findings are summarized as followed i the non spherical deformation of the air gun bubble seems to have little effect on the far field pressure wavelet including the primary pulse the bubble pulse and the bubble period in the air gun s original design and manufacture the increase of the utilization efficiency of the gas in the air gun η and the reduction of the time length of bubble aeration τ is helpful to improve the performance of the air gun ii for the clustered air gun bubbles both the period and the volume of the bubble are reduced as compared with single air gun bubble can expand to a larger volume at a smaller standoff distance d between two bubbles the primary to bubble pulse ratio will reach a maximum when the standoff distance d is about 1 6 times maximum radius of single bubble iii for the effect of the free surface primary to bubble pulse ratio is relative large at a small firing depth of the air gun h the firing depth of the air gun may set to be as small as possible on the premise of the air gun not above the water surface acknowledgement this work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 11672082 11672081 the authors are grateful to ms yang hui and mr ye yalong for the great help they have provided us in the experiment appendix a low voltage electric spark bubble generating method is adopted in this paper the same with the references cui et al 2013 yang 2015 zhang et al 2013 the high speed camera on the one side of the tank is photographed at a rate of 15000 frames s 1 illuminated by a 2 kw backlight on the opposite side of the tank the simple circuit of the bubble generator consists of a 6600 μf capacitor and a 200 v dc power supply two thin copper wires are taken as the electrodes with the discharge of the capacitor the copper wires are ignited into bright plasma and a bubble is generated all the experiments are conducted at room temperature and atmospheric pressure the maximum horizontal radius of the bubble is about 12 mm the motion of spark bubble in the gap between two cylinders with different diameters d is shown in fig 14 and fig 15 which provides a rough reference for the numerical study notably the bubble period may be prolonged by the combustion of copper wire electrodes in the formation of sparking bubbles which may also be one of the reasons for the difference in the bubble period of numerical results for d 8 mm bubble expands rapidly along the horizontal direction in the gap of two cylinders at initial stage when bubble overflows from the gap of the two cylinders motion of the bubble surface is accelerated in the vertical direction and bubble surface is obviously not smooth during the collapse of the bubble two opposite jets perpendicular to the solid wall of the cylinder are formed driven by two opposite jets the middle part of the bubble becomes thinner and thinner two opposite jets eventually make a collision at the bubble central axis and bubble splits into two parts the upper and lower bubble then rebound and slide along the rigid boundary of the cylinder fig 15 shows the motion of the spark bubble in the gap between two cylinders with a diameter of 6 mm which looks very similar to that in fig 14 d 8 mm the bubble volume is not easy to measure in the experiment but bubble period is

23513,in this paper a lower order unsteady hydrodynamic model of a cycloidal propeller along with in house experiments to validate the model is presented towards this the hydrodynamics of a cycloidal propeller is investigated thoroughly and various underlying physical phenomena such as dynamic virtual camber effects of near and shed wake leading edge vortices are rigorously modeled it is shown that the chord wise variation of incidence velocity angle on cycloidal propeller blade is manifested as dynamic virtual camber which depends on curvilinear flow geometry pitch angle pitch rate and inflow distribution by including all these effects together a generalized expression of additional lift due to virtual camber effect is developed to capture the effects of near wake a nonlinear lifting line model is incorporated rapid pitching of rotor blades produces unsteady phenomena such as strong leading edge vortices and shed wakes polhamus leading edge suction analogy is applied to model leading edge vortex to capture the effects of shed wake a method based on theodorsen s approach is developed a modified double multiple streamtube d ms model is used for modeling the complex

1 introduction in past few decades unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs have become popular among researchers and scientists due to its wide range of applications and future possibilities uuvs have huge potential for oceanographic studies such as deep water and shallow water marine exploration as well as military applications such as maritime intelligence surveillance reconnaissance isr mine countermeasures anti submarine warfare inspection identification communication payload delivery information operations and time critical strike u s navy 2004 oil and gas industry is also becoming interested in application of uuvs for pipeline inspection and surveillance sea floor mapping etc most of the common uuvs use conventional screw propellers which are mechanically simple and moderately efficient in steady cruise blidberg 2001 griffiths et al 2004 collar et al 1994 bandyopadhyay 2005 however a uuv using a single fixed conventional propeller would suffer from low agility and would be highly susceptible to disturbances especially during station keeping to overcome this barrier many uuvs are designed with multiple propellers in staggered arrangements to generate thrust in different directions to improve control authority although these types of configurations can offer superior maneuverability many of these additional propellers motors become redundant in forward motion which adds to the weight and reduces efficiency roper et al 2011 thrust production on conventional propellers relies on steady hydrodynamic mechanisms and it is challenging to keep a steady flow attached to the hydrofoil surface especially at low reynolds numbers therefore a conventional propeller blade can only operate over a narrow range of angle of angle of attack if the flow has to stay attached this leads to small stall margins and the slightest perturbation could cause the flow to separate on the other hand in nature fish fins and tail operate in a highly unsteady hydrodynamic regime with large variations in angle of attack and are more robust to perturbations for this reason bio inspired and biomimetic propulsion systems that exploits unsteady hydrodynamics just like natural swimmers have been investigated for the last two decades dating back to the robotuna developed at mit during the mid 90s anderson 1996 read 1999 haugsdal 2000 flores 2003 polidoro 2003 although many of these bio inspired robotic uuvs could be more efficient they used complex linkage systems powered with multiple servo motors or hydraulic pneumatic actuators which resulted in enormous mechanical complexity and weight when compared to conventional propellers kato 1998 triantafyllou et al 2004 phillips et al 2010 zhou and low 2012 palmre et al 2013 licht et al 2004 triantafyllou et al 2000 some recent studies investigated the use of smart materials such as shape memory alloys to actuate the motion thereby introducing other limitations such as bandwidth low 2011 roper et al 2011 in the present study a cycloidal propulsion system based uuv fig 1 is proposed cycloidal propellers exploit unsteady hydrodynamics for efficient thrust production while they also offer high maneuverability through instantaneous thrust vectoring as shown in fig 1 in the case of a cycloidal propeller the blade span is parallel to the axis of rotation of the propeller as shown in fig 2 the pitch angle of each blade is cyclically altered in such way that the blade experiences positive geometric angles of attack at both the top upstream and bottom downstream halves of the azimuth cycle resulting in a net thrust the magnitude of the net thrust can be adjusted by varying either the amplitude of blade pitch or the rotational speed while direction of the net thrust vector can be altered by varying the phase of cyclic blade pitch the main advantage of the cycloidal propulsion system is that a complete 360 instantaneous thrust vectoring can be achieved by simply phase shifting the cyclic pitch which could potentially improve the agility and disturbance rejection capability of a uuv propelled using this concept this could also be more power efficient and significantly faster than swiveling a conventional screw propeller there have been many recent studies jarugumilli et al 2013a 2013b benedict et al 2013a 2013c 2014a 2014b zachary et al 2013 shrestha et al 2012 2014 hrishikeshavan et al 2015 jarugumilli et al 2014 on cycloidal rotor systems for small scale aerial vehicle applications which showed that an optimized cycloidal rotor can be more efficient than conventional rotors benedict 2010 benedict et al 2011a 2013b the fundamental reason behind this is the decrease in induced power requirement due to uniform load distribution along blade span which also reduces rotor speed required to generate a certain thrust also unsteady fluid dynamic mechanisms such as leading edge vortices improve performance of cycloidal propulsion system as revealed by particle image velocimetry piv studies benedict et al 2010a 2010b furthermore due to dynamic pitching at high amplitudes and reduced frequencies cycloidal propeller blades can potentially exploit dynamic stall to generate very high lift coefficients even twice the static values walther et al 2017 for underwater applications cycloidal propellers commonly called voith schneider propellers or vsps fig 3 have been historically used on tug boats mine sweepers and other applications which require high thrust at low speeds which could be easily vectored for tight maneuvering station keeping etc haberman and harley 1961 haberman and caster 1962 sparenberg and de graaf 1969 ficken and dickerson 1969 james 1971 zhu 1981 notably there have been only a limited number of studies on cycloidal propellers for marine applications especially at high advance ratios dickerson and dobay 1970 bose and lai 1989 a detailed literature survey on the research on cycloidal marine propellers is provided in bartels and jürgens 2006 it is significant to note that not many systematic scientific studies have been conducted to unravel the complex unsteady fluid dynamics of cycloidal propellers in order to fully exploit its potential in the present literature there are very limited experimental data as well as analytical models that can predict performance of a cycloidal propeller especially for underwater propulsion moreover all the previous analytical models were only validated with time averaged performance measurements the first attempt to develop an aerodynamic model for cycloidal rotor was carried out by wheatley in 1930s wheatley 1933 wheatley and windler 1935 the model predictions were compared with time averaged wind tunnel measurements however it showed poor correlation with experimental data recently more fluid dynamic models were developed by mcnabb 2001 kim et al 2004 and hwang et al 2005 2006 however these studies were performed on large scale cycloidal rotors operating at higher reynolds numbers and showed good correlation with time averaged thrust and power measurements at mav scales cfd studies were carried out by iosilevskii and levy 2006 which showed good correlation with experimental results and also exposed some of the complex underlying fluid dynamic phenomena recently an aeroelastic model of cycloidal rotor was developed by benedict et al 2011b which utilized a simplified aerodynamic model and mainly focused on understanding effects of flexible blade deflections on cycloidal rotor performance recently voith schneider propellers vsp have attracted significant attention from researchers in esmailian et al 2014 cfd simulations have been carried out to predict vsp performance some studies have been carried out to develop simplified models of vsp jürgens et al 2007 however there have been very limited efforts to develop a lower order high fidelity hydrodynamic model that could be utilized for design and optimization of cycloidal propeller existing models lack detailed modeling of the physics of cycloidal propellers and therefore these models are not capable of accurately predicting instantaneous blade fluid dynamic forces none of the previous studies on cycloidal propellers provide information on the unsteady flow phenomena including dynamic virtual camber incidence and dynamic stall on the blades therefore the present paper focuses on the development of a detailed high fidelity unsteady hydrodynamic model which is capable of predicting not only the time averaged forces but also the time history of forces on a cycloidal propeller blade at the same time the present model is computationally inexpensive in the sense that it can be used for design optimization of cycloidal propellers to achieve this goal key fluid dynamic phenomena on a cycloidal propeller are investigated and rigorous modeling of virtual camber effects of near and shed wakes leading edge vortices are carried out moreover the inflow model is improved by modifying existing double multiple streamtube d ms model all these improvements enabled the model predictions to correlate reasonably well with the time history of forces obtained from in house experimental data the long term goal of this project is to develop a high fidelity hydroelastic cycloidal propeller model to be used in a computational design framework for next generation of cycloidal propeller based uuvs 2 methodology large amplitude high reduced frequency pitching motion of cycloidal propeller blades results in highly complex unsteady hydrodynamics characterized by strong leading edge vortex formation nonlinear dynamic virtual camber effects shed wake and blade wake interactions for accurate prediction of this complex physical system detailed cfd modeling is necessary which is out of scope for the present application where the objective is to develop a design code for a cycloidal propeller therefore a high fidelity lower order model has been developed which can predict instantaneous blade hydrodynamic forces and propeller performance cycle averaged thrust and power with sufficient accuracy a flow chart of the proposed hydrodynamic model is shown in fig 4 the first step in the proposed hydrodynamic model is to compute the magnitude and incident angle of the resultant flow velocity at each local chord wise location of propeller blade for this purpose blade speed is obtained from prescribed kinematics and flow speed is obtained from inflow information chord wise variation of incident flow angle is manifested as virtual camber effect which is discussed in detail in the subsequent sections once sectional angle of attack is obtained sectional quasi steady fluid dynamic forces are computed using thin airfoil theory in the next step several models are developed to incorporate effects of near and shed wakes and leading edge vortices using these models unsteady fluid dynamic forces on propeller blades are obtained an iterative procedure is used to calculate inflow and circulation which are computed from the obtained blade forces and iterated until both circulation and inflows are converged 2 1 dynamic virtual camber the cycloidal propeller blades experience a unique phenomenon known as virtual camber the virtual camber effect occurs due to the chord wise variation of the incident velocity angle or angle of attack on the hydrofoil this effect is very predominant in cycloidal propellers because the flow over a cycloidal propeller blade is characterized by a pitching hydrofoil in a curvilinear flow in the presence of inflow that varies along with azimuth a hydrofoil in a curvilinear flow experiences different flow velocity magnitude and direction along the chord due to geometry and the curvilinear nature of the flow this manifests as an effective camber and incidence fig 5 shows how curvilinear flow geometry creates a negative virtual camber effect for a blade at 0 pitch angle therefore a symmetric blade immersed in a curvilinear flow will behave like a cambered blade in a rectilinear flow as shown in fig 5 this phenomenon is more significant for cycloidal propellers with a large chord to radius ratio c r flow over a cycloidal propeller is not purely curvilinear when it is producing thrust because of the induced inflow velocity which also effects virtual camber and incidence fig 6 additionally the blade pitch angle and pitch rate also affects the chord wise velocity distribution and therefore virtual camber fig 7 shows pitch rate causing chord wise variation of flow incidence angle which is manifested as a positive virtual camber effect an opposite pitch rate nose down pitch would cause a negative virtual camber effect since blade pitch and pitch rate vary with azimuthal location corresponding virtual camber also changes with azimuth making it dynamic virtual camber to consider all these effects together a generalized expression has been derived to represent the variation of local angle of attack α x along blade chord all the velocity components of fluid relative to propeller blade is shown in fig 8 all the velocity components are computed along tangential i ˆ and normal j ˆ to propeller hydrofoil chord blade velocity v b at chord wise location x from pitching axis obtained from kinematics of propeller can be expressed as eq 1 1 v b x ω r cos θ δ ψ i ˆ ω r sin θ δ ψ j ˆ in above equation θ is geometric pitch angle of cycloidal propeller blade ψ is azimuth location of blade in a cycle ω is rotational speed of rotor r x is distance of local blade location x from center of cycloidal propeller using geometrical relations blade velocity can be rewritten as eq 2 2 v b x ω r cos θ i ˆ ω r sin θ x j ˆ in the above equation r is radius of cycloidal propeller flow velocity v p relative to propeller blade due to blade pitching is given as 3 v p x x θ j ˆ the inflow speed is represented as v i x acting on propeller blade at an angle β x w r t vertical axis thus inflow velocity v i can be expressed as 4 v i x v i sin β θ i ˆ v i cos β θ j ˆ considering all the above effects the net relative flow velocity v with respect to propeller blade is calculated eq 5 5 v x v p x v i x v b x substituting eqs 2 4 into eq 5 the net flow velocity can be expressed as 6 v x u t i ˆ u p j ˆ where 7 u t ω r cos θ v i sin β θ 8 u p x ω θ v i cos β θ ω r sin θ this information all together gives net flow speed v x and incident angle of attack α x x at each local chord wise location eqs 9 and 10 9 v x u t 2 u p 2 10 α x x tan 1 x ω θ v i cos β θ ω r sin θ ω r cos θ v i sin β θ in the above expression v i is assumed to be zero for first iteration and updated using inflow model modified d ms model discussed later for subsequent iterations for a cambered airfoil in straight flow the local angle of attack varies along chord according to following equation eq 11 11 α x x θ d y d x x by comparing eq 10 and eq 11 expression for virtual camber line of cycloidal propeller blade is obtained eq 12 12 d y d x θ tan 1 x ω θ v i cos β θ ω r sin θ ω r cos θ v i sin β θ modified thin airfoil theory has been used to calculate quasi steady lift from the chord wise variation of incidence for this purpose airfoil co ordinates are transformed along chord line fig 9 shows co ordinate transformation from actual chord line x y to virtual chord line x y and equations 13 and 14 provide expressions for this co ordinate transformation 13 x y y 1 sin ϕ s x x 1 cos ϕ s 14 y y y 1 cos ϕ s x x 1 sin ϕ s since the rotor blades in a cycloidal propeller goes through high angles of attack small angle of attack assumption is relaxed while using thin airfoil theory and a more general expression eq 15 is used 15 c l q u a s i s t e a d y k sin α c l 0 in the above equation k is a constant that represents lift curve slope at small angle of attack c l 0 is additional lift due to the effects of virtual camber c l 0 is a complex function of incidence angle given by eq 16 in this equation d y d x is obtained from eqs 12 14 d y d x represents slope of virtual camber line in transformed co ordinate x y using numerical integration procedure c l 0 is computed in eq 16 non dimensional parameter η is used x c 2 1 c o s η for integration purposes 16 c l 0 2 cos α 0 π d y d x cos η 1 d η 2 2 nonlinear lifting line model a nonlinear lifting line theory is implemented numerically to incorporate the effects of near wake and tip vortices finite span effect in this case a linear geometry of trailing vortex lines is assumed for this purpose the wing is divided into number of span wise elements nodal point is set to center of each element induced angle of attack at each nodal point is obtained using following formula eq 17 17 α i y 0 1 4 π v b 2 b 2 d γ d y y 0 y d y above integral is computed numerically using gauss quadrature integration rule 11 gauss quadrature points are used for this purpose from this effective angle of attack at each nodal point is obtained using α e f f y 0 α y 0 α i y 0 effective angle of attack is used to calculate quasi steady lift using eq 15 circulation is computed at the center of each element from calculated lift l ρ v γ for the first iteration suitable values of circulation based on elliptical lift distribution are assumed and circulation is updated from lift calculated at each iteration until convergence is obtained at each iteration circulation is updated using γ n e w γ o l d d γ n e w γ o l d where d is an update parameter and suitably chosen for proper convergence 0 05 in present simulations 2 3 unsteady effects rapid pitching of rotor blade produces strong unsteady phenomena such as leading edge vortex and shade wake to capture effect of shed wake an unsteady model based on theodorsen s approach has been developed theodorsen s function has been originally developed to calculate circulatory lift produced by sinusoidal variation of angle of attack and pitch angle due to inclusion of virtual camber and its nonlinear behavior the oscillatory part of the lift of a cycloidal propeller blade contains not just the first harmonic rather it shows high frequency components with varying phase delays to handle this an automated function has been developed that would perform fourier series decomposition of oscillatory part of lift due to shed wake and compute corresponding frequency and theodorsen s function to generate unsteady lift fourier decomposition of quasi steady lift coefficient can be expressed as following eq 18 18 c l q u a s i s t e a d y a 0 2 i 1 n a n cos i ω t b n sin i ω t first harmonic of quasi steady lift coefficient c l q u a s i s t e a d y is ω and corresponding reduced frequency is k f ω c 2 v theodorsen s function corresponding to higher harmonics are computed to calculate unsteady lift coefficient eq 19 19 c l u n s t e a d y c l n c a 0 2 i 1 n a n cos i ω t b n sin i ω t c i k f in the above equation c l n c is non circulatory lift co efficient and c i k f f i k f j g i k f is theodorsen s function corresponding to reduced frequency k i i k f where i varies from 1 to n 2 4 leading edge vortex high amplitude pitching of rotor blade creates strong leading edge vortex on cycloidal propeller as shown by some of the on going in house experimental studies walther et al 2017 fig 10 shows piv measured flow field showing large leading edge vortex formation leading edge vortex delays flow separation on rotor blade which significantly improves lift performance of rotor at high pitch angles enabling rotor to operate even at 45 pitch amplitudes polhamus leading edge suction analogy polhamus 1966 1968 is applied to model leading edge vortex additional lift vortex lift due to leading edge vortex and additional drag due to leading edge separation are modeled using this suction analogy 20 c l l e c l w o l e cos 2 α η l e sin 2 α k v cos α sin 2 α 21 c d l e c l w o l e sin α cos α 1 η l e k v sin 3 α in the above equation c l l e c d l e are lift and drag coefficient with leading edge suction and c l w o l e c d w o l e are lift and drag coefficient without leading edge suction k v is non dimensional coefficient related to additional vortex lift generated by leading edge vortex η l e represents percentage of leading edge suction η l e 1 means no leading edge suction and η l e 0 means complete leading edge suction 2 5 force computation once lift and drag coefficients c l and c d are computed lift and drag force in blade co ordinate system is obtained using lift l 1 2 ρ v 2 s c l and drag d 1 2 ρ v 2 s c d forces in blade co ordinate are transformed into inertial co ordinate using proper transformation matrices to calculate time averaged propeller thrust blade force is multiplied with solidity σ n b c 2πr and averaged over one revolution 2 6 inflow model previously in the analysis of cycloidal rotors and vertical axis wind turbines single streamtube inflow or double multiple streamtube d ms models have been mostly used benedict et al 2011b for single streamtube model the inflow is considered uniform along the azimuth and inflow at top and bottom halves of the blade is assumed to be same therefore no blade interaction or wake effect is considered after the flow passes through the upper half this assumption is not physical on the other hand for d ms model there is azimuthal variation in inflow magnitude however inflow direction is assumed to be radial to blade path in the upper half in the hover state which is also not physically realistic in the present hydrodynamic model schematic shown in fig 11 the proposed inflow model modified d ms model relaxes these assumptions in this model it is assumed that various streamlines interact with the rotor blade twice upstream and downstream with different inflow velocity magnitude and direction two adjacent streamlines form a streamtube unlike d ms model this modified model calculates the inflow direction based on resultant force direction on the blade at that particular azimuthal location eq 22 the underlying reasoning behind this approach is that at a local azimuthal location whatever hydrodynamic force the propeller blade experiences it exerts same force to the nearby fluid in the opposite direction when the rotor blade starts rotating it would accelerate nearby fluid opposite to the direction of resultant force blade is experiencing fig 12 22 γ u π ϕ tan 1 d l in eq 22 γ u is inflow angle at upstream locations ϕ is the angle between local tangent and resultant flow velocity with respect to propeller blade fig 12 once the inflow direction is calculated based on above approach actuator surface theory and mass and momentum conservation laws were applied to determine magnitude of inflow velocity eqs 14 and 16 at upstream v u and downstream v d the wake velocity of completely expanded flow after interacting with upstream blade is denoted as v u w a k e and wake velocity after interacting with downstream blade is denoted as v d w a k e using actuator surface theory inflow velocities can be expressed as eq 23 and eq 24 23 v u s 1 2 v v u w a k e s 24 v d s 1 2 v w s v u w a k e s in the above equations s denotes position in propeller disc arc and thus it is basically a function of azimuth force exerted by fluid on the propeller blade at upstream f u and downstream f d can be expressed as eq 25 and eq 26 respectively 25 f u s m v v u w a k e s 26 f d s m v u w a k e s v w s where m is the mass flow rate using continuity theory above equations can be rewritten as eq 27 and eq 28 27 f u ρ v u a sin γ u v v u w a k e 28 f d ρ v d a sin γ d v u w a k e v w by comparing eq 23 and eq 27 upstream inflow velocity v u and upstream wake velocity v u w a k e can be obtained eq 29 and eq 30 29 v u s v 2 v 2 4 f u s 2 ρ sin γ u s 30 v u w a k e s v f u s ρ v u s sin γ u s in the above equations f is force per unit area along the direction of flow in the similar procedure downstream inflow velocity v d and downstream wake velocity v d w a k e can be obtained eq 31 and eq 32 by comparing eq 24 and eq 28 31 v d s v u w a k e s 2 v u w a k e s 4 2 f u s 2 ρ sin γ u s 32 v d w a k e s v u w a k e s f d s ρ v d s sin γ d s once the inflow is updated using above equations 29 32 hydrodynamic forces are calculated based on new inflow and circulation these steps are repeated until both circulation and inflow are converged 3 model validation due to the dearth of experimental data in the present literature on time history of hydrodynamic forces on cycloidal propeller blade in house experiments were carried out and the present hydrodynamic model is validated with the results obtained from these experiments 3 1 experimental setup for model validation a test setup fig 13 is developed where a single bladed cycloidal propeller is tested inside a water tank at a reynolds number of around 18 000 forces and moments are measured using a miniature 6 component force balance at the blade root a 12 channel slip ring is used to transfer the signals from the force balance in the rotating frame to the data acquisition equipment in the stationary frame the blade pitching is controlled using an analog servo which allows us to prescribe specific pitching kinematics for a test the experiments are first conducted in air which provide the inertial forces then the same experiments are repeated in water the pure hydrodynamic forces are obtained by subtracting the inertial forces from the force measurements made in water 3 2 results dynamic pitching experiments are conducted with a single bladed cycloidal propeller at 40 rpm propeller blade has chord of 2 inches and span of 12 inches and pitched at quarter chord location radius of cycloidal propeller is 3 43 inches figs 14 and 15 respectively show the comparison between measured forces and predictions from the present hydrodynamic model the figures show the variation of radial and tangential force coefficients as a function of blade azimuthal location over a range of pitch amplitudes 20 to 45 the results show overall reasonable correlation between the present hydrodynamic model prediction and test data it is also interesting to see both from the experiment and analysis that the blades are producing higher radial and tangential forces at the lower half ψ 180 360 than the upper half ψ 0 180 the reason for this will be explained in the discussion section 4 discussion once the hydrodynamic model is validated with in house experimental data it is used to investigate physics behind thrust production of a cycloidal propeller in the following subsections details of various phenomena are discussed in depth 4 1 cause and effect of dynamic virtual camber as shown by eq 16 virtual camber manifests as additional lift on the blade fig 16 a shows variation of additional lift coefficient c l o due to virtual camber along azimuthal location for a cycloidal propeller blade rotating at 40 rpm with 35 pitch amplitude and fig 16b and c shows corresponding prescribed pitch and pitch rate measured values respectively as blade goes through various azimuthal locations it shows effects of curvilinear flow pitch pitch rate and inflow on virtual camber and therefore on additional lift from fig 16a it can be observed that virtual camber effect due to only curvilinear geometry magenta line is static in nature and it always causes negative virtual camber leading to negative c l o while pitch pitch rate and inflow creates time dependency of virtual camber effect making it a dynamic virtual camber fig 16a reveals that pitch and especially pitch rate creates a very dominant and characteristic virtual camber effect unlike inflow distribution which is more random in nature fig 16a shows that blade pitch decreases negative virtual camber and opposes the effects of curvilinear geometry the effect of blade pitch is more prominent near 90 and 270 azimuth since pitch angle reaches at its peak at those locations fig 16b it is also observed that pitch rate creates positive virtual camber effect near 0 azimuth which almost nullifies the effects of curvilinear geometry while at 180 it creates negative virtual camber which together with curvilinear effect produces even larger negative lift for this reason as seen from fig 14 the net radial force coefficient is near zero at 0 azimuth while it is much below zero at 180 azimuth although pitch angle is near 0 at both azimuth locations fig 16b pitch rate effect on virtual camber is dominant at 0 and 180 azimuth because pitch rate reaches its peak near these two locations fig 16c fig 17 shows graphically how pitch rate is creating opposite virtual camber effects at different azimuth locations this phenomenon is clearly observed in fig 18 fig 18 shows the actual chord line of cycloidal propeller blade and virtual chord line due to virtual camber effect along different azimuth locations it can be observed again at 0 azimuth virtual camber is minimum producing almost negligible negative lift while at 180 azimuth it has huge negative virtual camber producing large negative lift moreover viewing from inertial reference frame it can be observed from fig 18 that there is significant negative virtual camber when the blade operates in the upper half which causes flow to separate very early while in the entire lower half it creates a positive virtual camber which delays flow separation and blade can attain much higher lift at these locations moreover the virtual incidence decreases the effective angle of attack in the upper half and increases the angle of attack in the lower half these are the reasons why the magnitude of maximum radial and tangential force coefficients in the downstream half ψ 180 360 is significantly higher than that at upstream ψ 0 180 figs 14 and 15 4 2 reason for time averaged side forces another non intuitive physical phenomenon observed during the operation of cycloidal propeller is asymmetric or non negative net side force even with a symmetric prescribed pitch without any phase offset t y force shown in fig 2 from the kinematics shown in fig 2 intuitively one may expect all the side forces due to drag and lift to cancel each other giving only a net vertical force however in reality experiments have shown the presence of a dominating side force figs 19 and 20 fig 19 shows experimental comparison of time averaged forces over a range of pitch amplitude the results show existence of a non zero time averaged side force t y even though significantly smaller in magnitude than the vertical force t z to investigate this phenomenon instantaneous vertical and side forces are plotted and compared in fig 20 figs 19 and 20 show overall reasonable correlation between results obtained from experiments and analysis instantaneous vertical and side forces are obtained using following expressions 33 f z f r sin ψ f t cos ψ 34 f y f r cos ψ f t sin ψ in the above equations f r is the radial force f t is tangential force f z is vertical force and f y is side force at azimuth location ψ this phenomenon can be explained by dynamic virtual camber effect due to pitch rate and flow curvature it can be observed from eq 34 that side force comes from two sources radial and tangential forces radial force is mostly dominated by lift while tangential force is mostly dominated by drag the relation between lift drag and radial tangential force are given by equations 35 and 36 where α is angle of attack 35 f r l cos α d sin α 36 f t l sin α d cos α therefore it should be possible to trace back the source of side force to lift and drag on the blade the validated hydrodynamic model is used to investigate underlying reason behind non zero time averaged side force in fig 21 side force due to lift and drag are plotted separately to distinguish their effects fig 21a shows the contribution of instantaneous blade lift to side force note that in this case the x axis is plotted differently to separate the left and right halves it can be observed from fig 21a that if no virtual camber is considered blue line then side force due to lift is perfectly symmetric between left and right halves side force from left half of cycloidal propeller cycle ψ 90 270 cancels side force of right half ψ 270 450 90 as seen from fig 2 the red line in fig 21a shows that once the virtual camber due to curvilinear flow geometry and pitch angle is incorporated the side force is still symmetric between the left and right halves producing almost zero net side force this is because virtual camber due to flow curvature introduces asymmetry between top half upstream and bottom half downstream of the cycle the symmetry between right and left halves remains intact but once the virtual camber due to pitch rate is introduced black line in fig 21a it causes significant asymmetry in side force between left and right halves causing non zero net side force this is because the propeller blade goes through pitch up motion during right half of cycle ψ 270 450 90 while it goes through pitch down motion during left side of cycle ψ 90 270 as explained in the previous section the pitch up motion causes positive virtual camber effect while pitch down motion creates negative camber effect due to this two opposite virtual camber effects in left and right halves the side force gets unbalanced this phenomenon becomes evident from fig 18 where it is observed that cycloidal propeller motion creates mild negative virtual camber on right side while it creates large negative camber on left side from fig 2 one may expect the drag at the top half upstream to be canceled by the drag at the bottom half downstream fig 21b contribution of instantaneous blade drag to side force shows similar results when no virtual camber is included blue line is antisymmetric between upper and lower halves however once the virtual camber due to flow curvature is included the red line shows asymmetry in side force due to drag it shows decrease in magnitude of side force in the upstream half while increase in magnitude of side force in the downstream half this is because flow curvature creates almost equal negative camber everywhere in the upstream half geometric pitch is positive and thus negative virtual camber decreases effective angle of attack which in turn causes decrease in magnitude of drag and corresponding side force while in downstream half the geometric pitch is negative and negative virtual camber creates larger negative effective angle of attack observed from rotating blade frame which causes larger magnitude of drag and corresponding side force this phenomenon causes imbalance in side force due to drag 5 summary and conclusions the primary goal of this study is to develop a lower order unsteady hydrodynamic model of cycloidal propeller that can predict instantaneous blade forces and propeller performance with sufficient accuracy that it could be utilized for design optimization of next generation of uuvs towards this several underlying physical phenomena behind the operation of cycloidal propeller are thoroughly investigated dynamic virtual camber effects of shed and near wakes leading edge vortices and complex inflow characteristics are rigorously modeled the developed hydrodynamic model is validated with measured time history of fluid dynamic forces obtained from in house experimental data the key conclusions from the study are given below 1 chord wise variation of incident velocity angle on cycloidal propeller blade is manifested as virtual camber incidence effect virtual camber and incidence depend on curvilinear flow geometry pitch angle pitch rate and inflow distribution considering all these effects a generalized methodology is developed to model virtual camber 2 curvilinear geometry causes a static negative virtual camber at all azimuth locations while pitch pitch rate and inflow distribution cause cyclic variation of virtual camber with blade azimuthal location making it a dynamic virtual camber a positive blade pitch rate nose up pitch creates positive virtual camber while a negative pitch rate nose down pitch creates negative virtual camber 3 virtual camber caused by pitch rate creates asymmetry in side force due to blade lift between the right and the left halves however the virtual camber resulting from flow curvature creates asymmetry in side force between upper and lower halves due to blade drag these two types of asymmetries create net time averaged side force on a cycloidal propeller even with zero phase offset 4 due to curvilinear flow the cycloidal propeller blade experiences reverse or negative virtual camber in the upper half upstream half of its circular trajectory along with decrease in effective angle of attack due to negative virtual incidence however the blade experiences positive virtual camber observed from inertial frame and increase in effective angle of attack due to positive virtual incidence in the entire lower half downstream half for this reason blades produce larger hydrodynamic forces in the lower or downstream half as observed from both experiments and analysis moreover unsteady phenomena such as dynamic stall keep the flow attached to the cycloidal propeller blade up to very high pitch angles which results in very high sectional force coefficients 
23513,in this paper a lower order unsteady hydrodynamic model of a cycloidal propeller along with in house experiments to validate the model is presented towards this the hydrodynamics of a cycloidal propeller is investigated thoroughly and various underlying physical phenomena such as dynamic virtual camber effects of near and shed wake leading edge vortices are rigorously modeled it is shown that the chord wise variation of incidence velocity angle on cycloidal propeller blade is manifested as dynamic virtual camber which depends on curvilinear flow geometry pitch angle pitch rate and inflow distribution by including all these effects together a generalized expression of additional lift due to virtual camber effect is developed to capture the effects of near wake a nonlinear lifting line model is incorporated rapid pitching of rotor blades produces unsteady phenomena such as strong leading edge vortices and shed wakes polhamus leading edge suction analogy is applied to

1 introduction in past few decades unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs have become popular among researchers and scientists due to its wide range of applications and future possibilities uuvs have huge potential for oceanographic studies such as deep water and shallow water marine exploration as well as military applications such as maritime intelligence surveillance reconnaissance isr mine countermeasures anti submarine warfare inspection identification communication payload delivery information operations and time critical strike u s navy 2004 oil and gas industry is also becoming interested in application of uuvs for pipeline inspection and surveillance sea floor mapping etc most of the common uuvs use conventional screw propellers which are mechanically simple and moderately efficient in steady cruise blidberg 2001 griffiths et al 2004 collar et al 1994 bandyopadhyay 2005 however a uuv using a single fixed conventional propeller would suffer from low agility and would be highly susceptible to disturbances especially during station keeping to overcome this barrier many uuvs are designed with multiple propellers in staggered arrangements to generate thrust in different directions to improve control authority although these types of configurations can offer superior maneuverability many of these additional propellers motors become redundant in forward motion which adds to the weight and reduces efficiency roper et al 2011 thrust production on conventional propellers relies on steady hydrodynamic mechanisms and it is challenging to keep a steady flow attached to the hydrofoil surface especially at low reynolds numbers therefore a conventional propeller blade can only operate over a narrow range of angle of angle of attack if the flow has to stay attached this leads to small stall margins and the slightest perturbation could cause the flow to separate on the other hand in nature fish fins and tail operate in a highly unsteady hydrodynamic regime with large variations in angle of attack and are more robust to perturbations for this reason bio inspired and biomimetic propulsion systems that exploits unsteady hydrodynamics just like natural swimmers have been investigated for the last two decades dating back to the robotuna developed at mit during the mid 90s anderson 1996 read 1999 haugsdal 2000 flores 2003 polidoro 2003 although many of these bio inspired robotic uuvs could be more efficient they used complex linkage systems powered with multiple servo motors or hydraulic pneumatic actuators which resulted in enormous mechanical complexity and weight when compared to conventional propellers kato 1998 triantafyllou et al 2004 phillips et al 2010 zhou and low 2012 palmre et al 2013 licht et al 2004 triantafyllou et al 2000 some recent studies investigated the use of smart materials such as shape memory alloys to actuate the motion thereby introducing other limitations such as bandwidth low 2011 roper et al 2011 in the present study a cycloidal propulsion system based uuv fig 1 is proposed cycloidal propellers exploit unsteady hydrodynamics for efficient thrust production while they also offer high maneuverability through instantaneous thrust vectoring as shown in fig 1 in the case of a cycloidal propeller the blade span is parallel to the axis of rotation of the propeller as shown in fig 2 the pitch angle of each blade is cyclically altered in such way that the blade experiences positive geometric angles of attack at both the top upstream and bottom downstream halves of the azimuth cycle resulting in a net thrust the magnitude of the net thrust can be adjusted by varying either the amplitude of blade pitch or the rotational speed while direction of the net thrust vector can be altered by varying the phase of cyclic blade pitch the main advantage of the cycloidal propulsion system is that a complete 360 instantaneous thrust vectoring can be achieved by simply phase shifting the cyclic pitch which could potentially improve the agility and disturbance rejection capability of a uuv propelled using this concept this could also be more power efficient and significantly faster than swiveling a conventional screw propeller there have been many recent studies jarugumilli et al 2013a 2013b benedict et al 2013a 2013c 2014a 2014b zachary et al 2013 shrestha et al 2012 2014 hrishikeshavan et al 2015 jarugumilli et al 2014 on cycloidal rotor systems for small scale aerial vehicle applications which showed that an optimized cycloidal rotor can be more efficient than conventional rotors benedict 2010 benedict et al 2011a 2013b the fundamental reason behind this is the decrease in induced power requirement due to uniform load distribution along blade span which also reduces rotor speed required to generate a certain thrust also unsteady fluid dynamic mechanisms such as leading edge vortices improve performance of cycloidal propulsion system as revealed by particle image velocimetry piv studies benedict et al 2010a 2010b furthermore due to dynamic pitching at high amplitudes and reduced frequencies cycloidal propeller blades can potentially exploit dynamic stall to generate very high lift coefficients even twice the static values walther et al 2017 for underwater applications cycloidal propellers commonly called voith schneider propellers or vsps fig 3 have been historically used on tug boats mine sweepers and other applications which require high thrust at low speeds which could be easily vectored for tight maneuvering station keeping etc haberman and harley 1961 haberman and caster 1962 sparenberg and de graaf 1969 ficken and dickerson 1969 james 1971 zhu 1981 notably there have been only a limited number of studies on cycloidal propellers for marine applications especially at high advance ratios dickerson and dobay 1970 bose and lai 1989 a detailed literature survey on the research on cycloidal marine propellers is provided in bartels and jürgens 2006 it is significant to note that not many systematic scientific studies have been conducted to unravel the complex unsteady fluid dynamics of cycloidal propellers in order to fully exploit its potential in the present literature there are very limited experimental data as well as analytical models that can predict performance of a cycloidal propeller especially for underwater propulsion moreover all the previous analytical models were only validated with time averaged performance measurements the first attempt to develop an aerodynamic model for cycloidal rotor was carried out by wheatley in 1930s wheatley 1933 wheatley and windler 1935 the model predictions were compared with time averaged wind tunnel measurements however it showed poor correlation with experimental data recently more fluid dynamic models were developed by mcnabb 2001 kim et al 2004 and hwang et al 2005 2006 however these studies were performed on large scale cycloidal rotors operating at higher reynolds numbers and showed good correlation with time averaged thrust and power measurements at mav scales cfd studies were carried out by iosilevskii and levy 2006 which showed good correlation with experimental results and also exposed some of the complex underlying fluid dynamic phenomena recently an aeroelastic model of cycloidal rotor was developed by benedict et al 2011b which utilized a simplified aerodynamic model and mainly focused on understanding effects of flexible blade deflections on cycloidal rotor performance recently voith schneider propellers vsp have attracted significant attention from researchers in esmailian et al 2014 cfd simulations have been carried out to predict vsp performance some studies have been carried out to develop simplified models of vsp jürgens et al 2007 however there have been very limited efforts to develop a lower order high fidelity hydrodynamic model that could be utilized for design and optimization of cycloidal propeller existing models lack detailed modeling of the physics of cycloidal propellers and therefore these models are not capable of accurately predicting instantaneous blade fluid dynamic forces none of the previous studies on cycloidal propellers provide information on the unsteady flow phenomena including dynamic virtual camber incidence and dynamic stall on the blades therefore the present paper focuses on the development of a detailed high fidelity unsteady hydrodynamic model which is capable of predicting not only the time averaged forces but also the time history of forces on a cycloidal propeller blade at the same time the present model is computationally inexpensive in the sense that it can be used for design optimization of cycloidal propellers to achieve this goal key fluid dynamic phenomena on a cycloidal propeller are investigated and rigorous modeling of virtual camber effects of near and shed wakes leading edge vortices are carried out moreover the inflow model is improved by modifying existing double multiple streamtube d ms model all these improvements enabled the model predictions to correlate reasonably well with the time history of forces obtained from in house experimental data the long term goal of this project is to develop a high fidelity hydroelastic cycloidal propeller model to be used in a computational design framework for next generation of cycloidal propeller based uuvs 2 methodology large amplitude high reduced frequency pitching motion of cycloidal propeller blades results in highly complex unsteady hydrodynamics characterized by strong leading edge vortex formation nonlinear dynamic virtual camber effects shed wake and blade wake interactions for accurate prediction of this complex physical system detailed cfd modeling is necessary which is out of scope for the present application where the objective is to develop a design code for a cycloidal propeller therefore a high fidelity lower order model has been developed which can predict instantaneous blade hydrodynamic forces and propeller performance cycle averaged thrust and power with sufficient accuracy a flow chart of the proposed hydrodynamic model is shown in fig 4 the first step in the proposed hydrodynamic model is to compute the magnitude and incident angle of the resultant flow velocity at each local chord wise location of propeller blade for this purpose blade speed is obtained from prescribed kinematics and flow speed is obtained from inflow information chord wise variation of incident flow angle is manifested as virtual camber effect which is discussed in detail in the subsequent sections once sectional angle of attack is obtained sectional quasi steady fluid dynamic forces are computed using thin airfoil theory in the next step several models are developed to incorporate effects of near and shed wakes and leading edge vortices using these models unsteady fluid dynamic forces on propeller blades are obtained an iterative procedure is used to calculate inflow and circulation which are computed from the obtained blade forces and iterated until both circulation and inflows are converged 2 1 dynamic virtual camber the cycloidal propeller blades experience a unique phenomenon known as virtual camber the virtual camber effect occurs due to the chord wise variation of the incident velocity angle or angle of attack on the hydrofoil this effect is very predominant in cycloidal propellers because the flow over a cycloidal propeller blade is characterized by a pitching hydrofoil in a curvilinear flow in the presence of inflow that varies along with azimuth a hydrofoil in a curvilinear flow experiences different flow velocity magnitude and direction along the chord due to geometry and the curvilinear nature of the flow this manifests as an effective camber and incidence fig 5 shows how curvilinear flow geometry creates a negative virtual camber effect for a blade at 0 pitch angle therefore a symmetric blade immersed in a curvilinear flow will behave like a cambered blade in a rectilinear flow as shown in fig 5 this phenomenon is more significant for cycloidal propellers with a large chord to radius ratio c r flow over a cycloidal propeller is not purely curvilinear when it is producing thrust because of the induced inflow velocity which also effects virtual camber and incidence fig 6 additionally the blade pitch angle and pitch rate also affects the chord wise velocity distribution and therefore virtual camber fig 7 shows pitch rate causing chord wise variation of flow incidence angle which is manifested as a positive virtual camber effect an opposite pitch rate nose down pitch would cause a negative virtual camber effect since blade pitch and pitch rate vary with azimuthal location corresponding virtual camber also changes with azimuth making it dynamic virtual camber to consider all these effects together a generalized expression has been derived to represent the variation of local angle of attack α x along blade chord all the velocity components of fluid relative to propeller blade is shown in fig 8 all the velocity components are computed along tangential i ˆ and normal j ˆ to propeller hydrofoil chord blade velocity v b at chord wise location x from pitching axis obtained from kinematics of propeller can be expressed as eq 1 1 v b x ω r cos θ δ ψ i ˆ ω r sin θ δ ψ j ˆ in above equation θ is geometric pitch angle of cycloidal propeller blade ψ is azimuth location of blade in a cycle ω is rotational speed of rotor r x is distance of local blade location x from center of cycloidal propeller using geometrical relations blade velocity can be rewritten as eq 2 2 v b x ω r cos θ i ˆ ω r sin θ x j ˆ in the above equation r is radius of cycloidal propeller flow velocity v p relative to propeller blade due to blade pitching is given as 3 v p x x θ j ˆ the inflow speed is represented as v i x acting on propeller blade at an angle β x w r t vertical axis thus inflow velocity v i can be expressed as 4 v i x v i sin β θ i ˆ v i cos β θ j ˆ considering all the above effects the net relative flow velocity v with respect to propeller blade is calculated eq 5 5 v x v p x v i x v b x substituting eqs 2 4 into eq 5 the net flow velocity can be expressed as 6 v x u t i ˆ u p j ˆ where 7 u t ω r cos θ v i sin β θ 8 u p x ω θ v i cos β θ ω r sin θ this information all together gives net flow speed v x and incident angle of attack α x x at each local chord wise location eqs 9 and 10 9 v x u t 2 u p 2 10 α x x tan 1 x ω θ v i cos β θ ω r sin θ ω r cos θ v i sin β θ in the above expression v i is assumed to be zero for first iteration and updated using inflow model modified d ms model discussed later for subsequent iterations for a cambered airfoil in straight flow the local angle of attack varies along chord according to following equation eq 11 11 α x x θ d y d x x by comparing eq 10 and eq 11 expression for virtual camber line of cycloidal propeller blade is obtained eq 12 12 d y d x θ tan 1 x ω θ v i cos β θ ω r sin θ ω r cos θ v i sin β θ modified thin airfoil theory has been used to calculate quasi steady lift from the chord wise variation of incidence for this purpose airfoil co ordinates are transformed along chord line fig 9 shows co ordinate transformation from actual chord line x y to virtual chord line x y and equations 13 and 14 provide expressions for this co ordinate transformation 13 x y y 1 sin ϕ s x x 1 cos ϕ s 14 y y y 1 cos ϕ s x x 1 sin ϕ s since the rotor blades in a cycloidal propeller goes through high angles of attack small angle of attack assumption is relaxed while using thin airfoil theory and a more general expression eq 15 is used 15 c l q u a s i s t e a d y k sin α c l 0 in the above equation k is a constant that represents lift curve slope at small angle of attack c l 0 is additional lift due to the effects of virtual camber c l 0 is a complex function of incidence angle given by eq 16 in this equation d y d x is obtained from eqs 12 14 d y d x represents slope of virtual camber line in transformed co ordinate x y using numerical integration procedure c l 0 is computed in eq 16 non dimensional parameter η is used x c 2 1 c o s η for integration purposes 16 c l 0 2 cos α 0 π d y d x cos η 1 d η 2 2 nonlinear lifting line model a nonlinear lifting line theory is implemented numerically to incorporate the effects of near wake and tip vortices finite span effect in this case a linear geometry of trailing vortex lines is assumed for this purpose the wing is divided into number of span wise elements nodal point is set to center of each element induced angle of attack at each nodal point is obtained using following formula eq 17 17 α i y 0 1 4 π v b 2 b 2 d γ d y y 0 y d y above integral is computed numerically using gauss quadrature integration rule 11 gauss quadrature points are used for this purpose from this effective angle of attack at each nodal point is obtained using α e f f y 0 α y 0 α i y 0 effective angle of attack is used to calculate quasi steady lift using eq 15 circulation is computed at the center of each element from calculated lift l ρ v γ for the first iteration suitable values of circulation based on elliptical lift distribution are assumed and circulation is updated from lift calculated at each iteration until convergence is obtained at each iteration circulation is updated using γ n e w γ o l d d γ n e w γ o l d where d is an update parameter and suitably chosen for proper convergence 0 05 in present simulations 2 3 unsteady effects rapid pitching of rotor blade produces strong unsteady phenomena such as leading edge vortex and shade wake to capture effect of shed wake an unsteady model based on theodorsen s approach has been developed theodorsen s function has been originally developed to calculate circulatory lift produced by sinusoidal variation of angle of attack and pitch angle due to inclusion of virtual camber and its nonlinear behavior the oscillatory part of the lift of a cycloidal propeller blade contains not just the first harmonic rather it shows high frequency components with varying phase delays to handle this an automated function has been developed that would perform fourier series decomposition of oscillatory part of lift due to shed wake and compute corresponding frequency and theodorsen s function to generate unsteady lift fourier decomposition of quasi steady lift coefficient can be expressed as following eq 18 18 c l q u a s i s t e a d y a 0 2 i 1 n a n cos i ω t b n sin i ω t first harmonic of quasi steady lift coefficient c l q u a s i s t e a d y is ω and corresponding reduced frequency is k f ω c 2 v theodorsen s function corresponding to higher harmonics are computed to calculate unsteady lift coefficient eq 19 19 c l u n s t e a d y c l n c a 0 2 i 1 n a n cos i ω t b n sin i ω t c i k f in the above equation c l n c is non circulatory lift co efficient and c i k f f i k f j g i k f is theodorsen s function corresponding to reduced frequency k i i k f where i varies from 1 to n 2 4 leading edge vortex high amplitude pitching of rotor blade creates strong leading edge vortex on cycloidal propeller as shown by some of the on going in house experimental studies walther et al 2017 fig 10 shows piv measured flow field showing large leading edge vortex formation leading edge vortex delays flow separation on rotor blade which significantly improves lift performance of rotor at high pitch angles enabling rotor to operate even at 45 pitch amplitudes polhamus leading edge suction analogy polhamus 1966 1968 is applied to model leading edge vortex additional lift vortex lift due to leading edge vortex and additional drag due to leading edge separation are modeled using this suction analogy 20 c l l e c l w o l e cos 2 α η l e sin 2 α k v cos α sin 2 α 21 c d l e c l w o l e sin α cos α 1 η l e k v sin 3 α in the above equation c l l e c d l e are lift

lift generated by leading edge vortex η l e represents percentage of leading edge suction η l e 1 means no leading edge suction and η l e 0 means complete leading edge suction 2 5 force computation

are transformed into inertial co ordinate using proper transformation matrices to calculate time averaged propeller thrust blade force is multiplied with solidity σ n b c 2πr and averaged over one revolution 2 6 inflow model previously in the analysis of cycloidal rotors and vertical axis wind turbines single streamtube inflow or double multiple streamtube d ms models have been mostly used benedict et al 2011b for single streamtube model the inflow is considered uniform along the azimuth and inflow at top and bottom halves of the blade is assumed to be same therefore no blade interaction or wake effect is considered after the flow passes through the upper half this assumption is not physical on the other hand for d ms model there is azimuthal variation in inflow magnitude however inflow direction is assumed to be radial to blade path in the upper half in the hover state which is also not physically realistic in the present hydrodynamic model schematic shown in fig 11 the proposed inflow model modified d ms model relaxes these assumptions in this model it is assumed that various streamlines interact with the rotor blade twice upstream and downstream with different inflow velocity magnitude and direction two adjacent streamlines form a streamtube unlike d ms model this modified model calculates the inflow direction based on resultant force direction on the blade at that particular azimuthal location eq 22 the underlying reasoning behind this approach is that at a local azimuthal location whatever hydrodynamic force the propeller blade experiences it exerts same force to the nearby fluid in the opposite direction when the rotor blade starts rotating it would accelerate nearby fluid opposite to the direction of resultant force blade is experiencing fig 12 22 γ u π ϕ tan 1 d l in eq 22 γ u is inflow angle at upstream locations ϕ is the angle between local tangent and resultant flow velocity with respect to propeller blade fig 12 once the inflow direction is calculated based on above approach actuator surface theory and mass and momentum conservation laws were applied to determine magnitude of inflow velocity eqs 14 and 16 at upstream v u and downstream v d the wake velocity of completely expanded flow after interacting with upstream blade is denoted as v u w a k e and wake velocity after interacting with downstream blade is denoted as v d w a k e using actuator surface theory inflow velocities can be expressed as eq 23 and eq 24 23 v u s 1 2 v v u w a k e s 24 v d s 1 2 v w s v u w a k e s in the above equations s denotes position in propeller disc arc and thus it is basically a function of azimuth force exerted by fluid on the propeller blade at upstream f u and downstream f d can be expressed as eq 25 and eq 26 respectively 25 f u s m v v u w a k e s 26 f d s m v u w a k e s v w s where m is the mass flow rate using continuity theory above equations can be rewritten as eq 27 and eq 28 27 f u ρ v u a sin γ u v v u w a k e 28 f d ρ v d a sin γ d v u w a k e v w by comparing eq 23 and eq 27 upstream inflow velocity v u and upstream wake velocity v u w a k e can be obtained eq 29 and eq 30 29 v u s v 2 v 2 4 f u s 2 ρ sin γ u s 30 v u w a k e s v f u s ρ v u s sin γ u s in the above equations f is force per unit area along the direction of flow in the similar procedure downstream inflow velocity v d and downstream wake velocity v d w a k e can be obtained eq 31 and eq 32 by comparing eq 24 and eq 28 31 v d s v u w a k e s 2 v u w a k e s 4 2 f u s 2 ρ sin γ u s 32 v d w a k e s v u w a k e s f d s ρ v d s sin γ d s once the inflow is updated using above equations 29 32 hydrodynamic forces are calculated based on new inflow and circulation these steps are repeated until both circulation and inflow are converged 3 model validation due to the dearth of experimental data in the present literature on time history of hydrodynamic forces on cycloidal propeller blade in house experiments were carried out and the present hydrodynamic model is validated with the results obtained from these experiments 3 1 experimental setup for model validation a test setup fig 13 is developed where a single bladed cycloidal propeller is tested inside a water tank at a reynolds number of around 18 000 forces and moments are measured using a miniature 6 component force balance at the blade root a 12 channel slip ring is used to transfer the signals from the force balance in the rotating frame to the data acquisition equipment in the stationary frame the blade pitching is controlled using an analog servo which allows us to prescribe specific pitching kinematics for a test the experiments are first conducted in air which provide the inertial forces then the same experiments are repeated in water the pure hydrodynamic forces are obtained by subtracting the inertial forces from the force measurements made in water 3 2 results dynamic pitching experiments are conducted with a single bladed cycloidal propeller at 40 rpm propeller blade has chord of 2 inches and span of 12 inches and pitched at quarter chord location radius of cycloidal propeller is 3 43 inches figs 14 and 15 respectively show the comparison between measured forces and predictions from the present hydrodynamic model the figures show the variation of radial and tangential force coefficients as a function of blade azimuthal location over a range of pitch amplitudes 20 to 45 the results show overall reasonable correlation between the present hydrodynamic model prediction and test data it is also interesting to see both from the experiment and analysis that the blades are producing higher radial and tangential forces at the lower half ψ 180 360 than the upper half ψ 0 180 the reason for this will be explained in the discussion section 4 discussion once the hydrodynamic model is validated with in house experimental data it is used to investigate physics behind thrust production of a cycloidal propeller in the following subsections details of various phenomena are discussed in depth 4 1 cause and effect of dynamic virtual camber as shown by eq 16 virtual camber manifests as additional lift on the blade fig 16 a shows variation of additional lift coefficient c l o due to virtual camber along azimuthal location for a cycloidal propeller blade rotating at 40 rpm with 35 pitch amplitude and fig 16b and c shows corresponding prescribed pitch and pitch rate measured values respectively as blade goes through various azimuthal locations it shows effects of curvilinear flow pitch pitch rate and inflow on virtual camber and therefore on additional lift from fig 16a it can be observed that virtual camber effect due to only curvilinear geometry magenta line is static in nature and it always causes negative virtual camber leading to negative c l o while pitch pitch rate and inflow creates time dependency of virtual camber effect making it a dynamic virtual camber fig 16a reveals that pitch and especially pitch rate creates a very dominant and characteristic virtual camber effect unlike inflow distribution which is more random in nature fig 16a shows that blade pitch decreases negative virtual camber and opposes the effects of curvilinear geometry the effect of blade pitch is more prominent near 90 and 270 azimuth since pitch angle reaches at its peak at those locations fig 16b it is also observed that pitch rate creates positive virtual camber effect near 0 azimuth which almost nullifies the effects of curvilinear geometry while at 180 it creates negative virtual camber which together with curvilinear effect produces even larger negative lift for this reason as seen from fig 14 the net radial force coefficient is near zero at 0 azimuth while it is much below zero at 180 azimuth although pitch angle is near 0 at both azimuth locations fig 16b pitch rate effect on virtual camber is dominant at 0 and 180 azimuth because pitch rate reaches its peak near these two locations fig 16c fig 17 shows graphically how pitch rate is creating opposite virtual camber effects at different azimuth locations this phenomenon is clearly observed in fig 18 fig 18 shows the actual chord line of cycloidal propeller blade and virtual chord line due to virtual camber effect along different azimuth locations it can be observed again at 0 azimuth virtual camber is minimum producing almost negligible negative lift while at 180 azimuth it has huge negative virtual camber producing large negative lift moreover viewing from inertial reference frame it can be observed from fig 18 that there is significant negative virtual camber when the blade operates in the upper half which causes flow to separate very early while in the entire lower half it creates a positive virtual camber which delays flow separation and blade can attain much higher lift at these locations moreover the virtual incidence decreases the effective angle of attack in the upper half and increases the angle of attack in the lower half these are the reasons why the magnitude of maximum radial and tangential force coefficients in the downstream half ψ 180 360 is significantly higher than that at upstream ψ 0 180 figs 14 and 15 4 2 reason for time averaged side forces another non intuitive physical phenomenon observed during the operation of cycloidal propeller is asymmetric or non negative net side force even with a symmetric prescribed pitch without any phase offset t y force shown in fig 2 from the kinematics shown in fig 2 intuitively one may expect all the side forces due to drag and lift to cancel each other giving only a net vertical force however in reality experiments have shown the presence of a dominating side force figs 19 and 20 fig 19 shows experimental comparison of time averaged forces over a range of pitch amplitude the results show existence of a non zero time averaged side force t y even though significantly smaller in magnitude than the vertical force t z to investigate this phenomenon instantaneous vertical and side forces are plotted and compared in fig 20 figs 19 and 20 show overall reasonable correlation between results obtained from experiments and analysis instantaneous vertical and side forces are obtained using following expressions 33 f z f r sin ψ f t cos ψ 34 f y f r cos ψ f t sin ψ in the above equations f r is the radial force f t is tangential force f z is vertical force and f y is side force at azimuth location ψ this phenomenon can be explained by dynamic virtual camber effect due to pitch rate and flow curvature it can be observed from eq 34 that side force comes from two sources radial and tangential forces radial force is mostly dominated by lift while tangential force is mostly dominated by drag the relation between lift drag and radial tangential force are given by equations 35 and 36 where α is angle of attack 35 f r l cos α d sin α 36 f t l sin α d cos α therefore it should be possible to trace back the source of side force to lift and drag on the blade the validated hydrodynamic model is used to investigate underlying reason behind non zero time averaged side force in fig 21 side force due to lift and drag are plotted separately to distinguish their effects fig 21a shows the contribution of instantaneous blade lift to side force note that in this case the x axis is plotted differently to separate the left and right halves it can be observed from fig 21a that if no virtual camber is considered blue line then side force due to lift is perfectly symmetric between left and right halves side force from left half of cycloidal propeller cycle ψ 90 270 cancels side force of right half ψ 270 450 90 as seen from fig 2 the red line in fig 21a shows that once the virtual camber due to curvilinear flow geometry and pitch angle is incorporated the side force is still symmetric between the left and right halves producing almost zero net side force this is because virtual camber due to flow curvature introduces asymmetry between top half upstream and bottom half downstream of the cycle the symmetry between right and left halves remains intact but once the virtual camber due to pitch rate is introduced black line in fig 21a it causes significant asymmetry in side force between left and right halves causing non zero net side force this is because the propeller blade goes through pitch up motion during right half of cycle ψ 270 450 90 while it goes through pitch down motion during left side of cycle ψ 90 270 as explained in the previous section the pitch up motion causes positive virtual camber effect while pitch down motion creates negative camber effect due to this two opposite virtual camber effects in left and right halves the side force gets unbalanced this phenomenon becomes evident from fig 18 where it is observed that cycloidal propeller motion creates mild negative virtual camber on right side while it creates large negative camber on left side from fig 2 one may expect the drag at the top half upstream to be canceled by the drag at the bottom half downstream fig 21b contribution of instantaneous blade drag to side force shows similar results when no virtual camber is included blue line is antisymmetric between upper and lower halves however once the virtual camber due to flow curvature is included the red line shows asymmetry in side force due to drag it shows decrease in magnitude of side force in the upstream half while increase in magnitude of side force in the downstream half this is because flow curvature creates almost equal negative camber everywhere in the upstream half geometric pitch is positive and thus negative virtual camber decreases effective angle of attack which in turn causes decrease in magnitude of drag and corresponding side force while in downstream half the geometric pitch is negative and negative virtual camber creates larger negative effective angle of attack observed from rotating blade frame which causes larger magnitude of drag and corresponding side force this phenomenon causes imbalance in side force due to drag 5 summary and conclusions the primary goal of this study is to develop a lower order unsteady hydrodynamic model of cycloidal propeller that can predict instantaneous blade forces and propeller performance with sufficient accuracy that it could be utilized for design optimization of next generation of uuvs towards this several underlying physical phenomena behind the operation of cycloidal propeller are thoroughly investigated dynamic virtual camber effects of shed and near wakes leading edge vortices and complex inflow characteristics are rigorously modeled the developed hydrodynamic model is validated with measured time history of fluid dynamic forces obtained from in house experimental data the key conclusions from the study are given below 1 chord wise variation of incident velocity angle on cycloidal propeller blade is manifested as virtual camber incidence effect virtual camber and incidence depend on curvilinear flow geometry pitch angle pitch rate and inflow distribution considering all these effects a generalized methodology is developed to model virtual camber 2 curvilinear geometry causes a static negative virtual camber at all azimuth locations while pitch pitch rate and inflow distribution cause cyclic variation of virtual camber with blade azimuthal location making it a dynamic virtual camber a positive blade pitch rate nose up pitch creates positive virtual camber while a negative pitch rate nose down pitch creates negative virtual camber 3 virtual camber caused by pitch rate creates asymmetry in side force due to blade lift between the right and the left halves however the virtual camber resulting from flow curvature creates asymmetry in side force between upper and lower halves due to blade drag these two types of asymmetries create net time averaged side force on a cycloidal propeller even with zero phase offset 4 due to curvilinear flow the cycloidal propeller blade experiences reverse or negative virtual camber in the upper half upstream half of its circular trajectory along with decrease in effective angle of attack due to negative virtual incidence however the blade experiences positive virtual camber observed from inertial frame and increase in effective angle of attack due to positive virtual incidence in the entire lower half downstream half for this reason blades produce larger hydrodynamic forces in the lower or downstream half as observed from both experiments and analysis moreover unsteady phenomena such as dynamic stall keep the flow attached to the cycloidal propeller blade up to very high pitch angles which results in very high sectional force coefficients

23514,one of the major goals of the sunrise fp7 project is to make the underwater internet of things a reality in this context the loon dock project presented here extends the existing litoral ocean observatory network testbed with a docking station tailored to the sparus ii auv the docking system allows a remote user to program survey like missions through a web based interface as well as to retrieve the data gathered by the auv once a mission finalizes to enable the autonomous docking of the auv two complementary and cost effective localization systems have been developed the first one implements a range only localization algorithm to approach the docking station while the second based on active light beacons provides high accuracy at short ranges to complete the docking maneuver the system has been extensively tested in different trials from a controlled water tank environment to more realistic sea operation conditions proving its viability despite very poor water visibility conditions keywords auv docking station acoustic localization visual tracking remote operation 1 introduction the increased number of deployed subsea systems infrastructures sensors robots gliders and others during the last years is raising the need for interconnection among themselves and to the exterior world for a better management and exploitation this is one of the major goals of the sunrise fp7 project petrioli et al 2013 which is devoted to make the underwater internet of things uiot a reality connecting the underwater systems to the network and endowing them with the capability of making their data widely accessible while minimizing the need of human interaction has the potential of providing ocean data at an unprecedented scale persistent deployment of buoyancy driven vehicles gliders in open waters has already been achieved for periods of time spanning months manley and willcox 2010 meyer 2016 however persistent deployment of survey type autonomous underwater vehicles auvs capable of more complex mapping missions is a challenging problem that arises the requirement of docking the objective behind the docking concept is to extend the deployment time by installing a docking station ds that allows to extract the data of finished missions program new missions and recharge the batteries of the vehicle without recovering it at the surface the first systems were designed for oceanographic sampling purposes curtin et al 1993 singh et al 2001 more recently the interest has grown towards using auvs in commercial scenarios for the periodic inspection and maintenance of subsea installations brignone et al 2007 krupinski et al 2008 jacobson et al 2013 in addition a significant part of docking related works have emerged from operational environments where launch and recovery is a difficult task such as under ice operations king et al 2009 however despite many demonstrations have taken place since the 90 s the combined need of infrastructure physical mounting power communications and the demanding vehicle reliability required to operate continuously without human servicing still makes docking a state of the art problem bellingham 2016 in the context of the sunrise project the loon dock project presented here aims to extend the existing litoral ocean observatory network loon testbed alves et al 2014 with a ds to demonstrate data transmission from a survey auv to the internet the idea is to be able to remotely operate the auv from the sunrise gate petrioli et al 2014 a web interface created to remotely schedule experiments using assets persistently deployed in different testbed facilities around the world for the auvs to really become part of the uiot it is essential to provide docking solutions that are cost effective while maintaining the performance and reliability of the system in this sense our proposal strives to keep the implemented docking approach low cost in all the addressed aspects namely the mechanical design the communications and the autonomous docking procedure the power transference to the auv is not covered in the scope of this work however it is worth noting that solutions for wireless inductive power transference already exist in the market and could be integrated at a certain cost from the hardware point of view the developed ds is based on a funnel shaped receptacle which is a traditional solution cowen et al 1997 allen et al 2006 mcewen et al 2008 to physically guide the vehicle into the dock another common design found in the literature are the vertical dock poles singh et al 2001 stone et al 2010 that allow the vehicle to approach from any direction making them more robust to changing water disturbances to alleviate the directionality constrain the funnel receptacle has been designed so that it can pivot over the static base and be oriented according to the water currents of the environment compared to a pole dock the funnel shaped design eases the installation of the necessary equipment to support the communications and the homing maneuvers facilitates the establishment of links with the vehicle and protects the auv against environmental hazards while docked with regards to communications the developed docking system is directly connected to the internet through the loon infrastructure and features two modes of communication with the auv the first mode uses an acoustic modem and the sunset protocol petrioli et al 2015 a lightweight networking framework well suited for underwater acoustic communications the second mode intended for when the auv is docked is based on a contactless wifi module installed in the ds which is crucial to transfer at high speed the vast amounts of data that a survey auv can gather in a mission the use of a contactless radio frequency module based on a commercial off the shelf cots wifi modem provides a reliable and low cost data transmission system mcewen et al 2008 capable of achieving transfer speeds in the order of tens of mbps it does not require the mating of connectors underwater thus preventing the exposure of electrical contacts and provides a less sensitive alignment with respect to establishing direct electrical connections stokey et al 2001 or inductive coupling feezor et al 2001 to assist the autonomous docking procedure the ds employs the acoustic modem as a range only transponder for mid range homing and a set of light beacons installed in the funnel entrance for the terminal phase of the docking the autonomous docking is tackled from the general scenario in which the vehicle does not know the exact position of the ds usually because it has lost the communication with the ds during a mission execution and only has an a priori coarse estimate of its position then following the nomenclature established in bellingham 2016 our proposed approach for autonomous docking works as follows see fig 1 first the vehicle starts from an en route phase that gets the vehicle close enough so it can sense the ds with the on board acoustic transponder this navigation is performed according to the on board navigation filter that merges information from different sensors to navigate relative to the earth next in the approach setup phase a range only localization filter is used to estimate the ds location while the auv is guided along an observable trajectory once an estimation of the ds position becomes known the vehicle approaches the ds to bring it within visual reach i e approach phase the light beacon navigation system is used to estimate the ds pose with respect to the auv on board camera visual information is used to update a single landmark simultaneous localization and mapping filter that provides the relative position between the auv and the ds with the accuracy required for the terminal homing phase preliminary versions of these two localization algorithms have been previously reported in a simulation environment vallicrosa et al 2016 in order to back up the visual localization during the very last few meters of the approach when the light beacons are no longer inside the camera field of view a complementary system has been integrated using augmented reality ar markers garrido jurado et al 2014 after this phase the auv ends up inside the docking funnel and is guided up to the latch mechanism by controlling the generated forward thrust i e capture phase existing solutions to perform autonomous docking usually rely in more complex acoustic sensors including usbl mcewen et al 2008 allen et al 2006 or inverted sbl setups smith and kronen 1997 optical sensors have also been explored for the terminal phase with solutions comprising either active light sources with single cowen et al 1997 murarka et al 2009 li et al 2015 2016 or multi light systems hong et al 2003 park et al 2009 or passive patterns and markers kushnerik et al 2009 maire et al 2009 that can be detected by on board cameras altogether our approach provides an hierarchical homing procedure that ensures a reliable approach and terminal homing maneuvers enabled with low cost equipment and minimal requirements on both the vehicle and the ds sides notice that indeed the acoustic ranging and optical image acquisition are capabilities that either already exist in most auvs or can be easily added at a reasonable cost the same reasoning applies to the docking station since the light beacon system and the ar markers are relatively inexpensive to manufacture the reminder of this paper is organized as follows next section describes in more detail the employed auv and the design of the proposed docking station section 3 introduces the navigation system of the auv together with the developed algorithms for autonomous docking including both the range only localization and the visual localization of the ds section 4 covers the insights about operation and control involving the remote operation through the sunrise web based interface and the auv guidance module that controls the various phases of the autonomous docking section 5 presents the experiments that have been performed together with an analysis of the results obtained with the system fully integrated in the loon infrastructure finally section 6 reports the conclusions and points out future work directions 2 hardware the ds has been designed especially for the sparus ii auv carreras et al 2013 see fig 2 sparus ii auv is a lightweight i e 50 kg torpedo shaped vehicle with partial hovering capabilities it has two horizontal and one vertical thrusters allowing surge heave and yaw movements and a mission specific payload area its flexibility and easy operation makes the sparus ii auv a multipurpose platform adaptable to a high variety of mapping applications in shallow water i e up to 200 m the ds provides active and passive guidance for docking a latching mechanism to maintain the vehicle docked while in standby mode high bandwidth data communications and visual feedback the ds has been designed to be as small as possible and lightweight for easy transportation deployment and recovery it is constructed mainly from corrosion resistance aluminium and polyoxymethylene pom the structure consists of two main parts the docking part and the base see fig 3 the entrance of the docking part has fourteen funnel shaped rails that passively guide the vehicle to the dock position using vehicle s thrust the size of the funnel can handle translation misalignment of 40 cm and rails arrangement can correct vehicle misalignment s in roll and pitch up to 30deg rail guides are made from flexible pom which can absorb collisions thus minimizing vehicle back bouncing the base connects with the docking part with a single axis rotation mechanism that allows the docking part to align with water currents without moving the base current implementation requires manual input for the rotation i e by using a diver however in the future an active automatic mechanism will be implemented the base feet can be adjusted up to 20 cm in height in order to level the ds and accommodate ballast weights to keep the centre of gravity low a latching system see fig 4 has been developed to prevent the vehicle from exiting the ds due to water currents thus allowing it to enter in low power mode once docked when the vehicle has entered the ds in its final position two claws grip on the antenna does not allow the auv to exit the operation of the claws is controlled from a servo motor there is a solid join between the motor and the right claw and from this the motion is propagated to the left claw via flexible wires the servo motor when activated has enough torque to withstand opening forces if the vehicle tries to exit due to water currents or even with its thrusters however if it is deactivated such in the event of a ds power loss the claws are disengaged and with relatively small thrust the auv can safely exit two active systems provide mid and short range localization information to the auv in order to guide it to the ds using the algorithms that will be described in section 3 for mid range detection an evologics acoustic modem is installed on the top of the ds performing two main functions a transponder function providing range measurements for homing and a modem function to monitor the auv during survey operations and to allow the user to send basic commands to the auv remotely for short range guidance when the ds is within the auv visual range of its camera light beacons are used to provide localization aid there are four beacons installed around the entrance ring in a symmetrical fashion each individual light beacon consists of five high intensity leds to create a homogeneous lighting effect inside a waterproof housing see fig 5 each beacon provides flashing light at approximately 110deg field of view fov fov at 1 hz period with 90 on 10 off duty cycle the system is operated at 24 v and the maximum power consumption is 22 w when all markers are lit the beacons can be remotely activated from top side two high bandwidth data communications interfaces have been included in the ds one between the top side and the ds and one between the ds and the auv it is very common to install the ds in long distance from the top side base establishing communications between them can be achieved either by wireless connection via a surface buoy or by fixed wire given that in the area where the system was demonstrated i e the loon testbed there are restrictions for installing permanent surface buoys we chose to implement a wired connection with a long cable laying on the seafloor nevertheless the ds can be easily modified to support wireless connection for the wired communication scheme we are using vdsl2 technology it supports via a single twisted pair up to 100mbit s downstream rates at 500 m and graduate decreasing to 1 4mbit s over distances of 4 5 km we have also included an ethernet connection though it can only be reliably used for distances shorter than 100 m for the auv to ds communication a wifi modem has been adapted to fit in a waterproof housing and is positioned on the latching mechanism when the auv is docked its wifi antenna is close enough to the modem 7 cm to allow a strong wireless data link with this system we are able to communicate with up to 45mbit s between the auv and the top side on the ds there is a watertight container that houses all the necessary electronic components for its operation that includes a pressure sensor an inertial measurement unit imu and an ethernet switch connecting the evologics modem the wifi modem and a raspberry pi 3 single board computer the raspberry pi 3 is locally running ros quigley et al 2009 and provides control for the latch mechanism and the leds it is also in charge to broadcast through the modem the ds depth and orientations obtained from the imu in order to check that the ds has been properly leveled during its installation besides there is also a webcam that points to the center of ds imaging the auv when it is docked there is also an independent underwater analog video camera that is placed on the side of the ds providing a general overview of the ds and the auv when approaching the ds is connected to top side via two independent cables one for power and one for data to minimize electromagnetic interferences it is powered with 220vac via an isolation transformer in order to minimize power loss the data cable is an ethernet cat 5e cable where one pair is used for the vdsl2 one for the analog video and the last four are used for the short range ethernet link 3 auv navigation and ds localization the navigation filter of the sparus ii auv is based on the well known extended kalman filter ekf it combines the information on depth returned by the pressure sensor velocities from the doppler velocity log dvl and attitude from the attitude and heading reference system ahrs to provide a dead reckoning dr navigation this navigation drifts over time and needs absolute measurements to correct it those measurements can come from either global positioning system gps when on surface ultra short base line usbl or acoustic ranges or visual detections with respect to a known landmark see fig 6 a feature based ekf slam navigation filter is used in the proposed scenario where the only landmark will be the ds the state vector for the implemented filter is the following 1 x x y z u v w l 1 l n where x y z and u v w are the position and linear velocity vectors of the auv and l i is the landmark i pose vector defined as 2 l i l x i l y i l z i l ϕ i l θ i l ψ i because range only measurements cannot estimate the landmark orientation a landmark must be initialized by a visual detection however once in the state vector both range only and visual based updates can be applied the navigation filter uses a constant velocity model with attitude input 3 x ˆ k x k 1 y k 1 z k 1 ℛ ϕ k θ k ψ k u k 1 v k 1 w k 1 t n u k 1 n v k 1 n w k 1 t 2 2 u k 1 n u k 1 v k 1 n v k 1 w k 1 n w k 1 l 1 k 1 l n k 1 where t is the sample time n u n v n w is the noise vector and ϕ k θ k ψ k are the euler angles used as the filter input u k each sensor measurement is modelled as 4 z k h x ˆ k s k where z k is the measurement itself h is the observation matrix that relates the state vector with the sensor measurement h x ˆ k if the measurement is not linear and s k is the sensor noise to differentiate between range and light beacon measurements we will use z k r n g h r n g and z k l b h l b respectively in case of range only measurements the observation equation provides the expected range measurement h r n g x ˆ k which is given by the norm of the difference between the vehicle and beacon positions at time k 5 h r n g x ˆ k x y z l x i l y i l z i in the case of a visual detection measurements updates are linear being 6 z k l b l x i l y i l z i l ϕ i l θ i l ψ i and 7 h l b ℛ ϕ k θ k ψ k t 0 3 3 ℛ ϕ k θ k ψ k t 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 i 3 3 where l x i l y i l z i is the relative position of the landmark with respect to the vehicle l ϕ i l θ i l ψ i is the landmark orientation with respect the inertial frame and ℛ ϕ k θ k ψ k is the vehicle orientation rotation matrix at time k when the position of the ds is unknown or known with a high uncertainty the range only localization method described in section 3 1 is used to obtain an approximate location once the vehicle homes to the vicinity of the ds the light beacon detection system will be used to initialize the landmark in the ekf slam navigation filter and to provide accurate updates see section 3 2 3 1 ds range only localization range only localization is a highly non linear problem given 1d measurements range the vehicle must be localized in a higher dimensional space 3d with an unknown position of the beacon and after the first measurement the probability distribution has the shape of a spherical shell with thickness equal to the range measurement uncertainty kalman filter kf represents a location as a gaussian with a mean and a covariance matrix that can be used to express a location as a sphere but not as a spherical shell therefore the use of kf is not appropriate for this problem several range only localization methods have been reported in the literature vaganay et al 2000 newman and leonard 2003 olson et al 2006 webster et al 2009 wang et al 2013 blanco et al 2008 however those methods are demonstrated offline after the vehicle is recovered and no online localization is performed in order to simplify the problem from 3d localization to 2d we project the measured ranges r n g 8 to the horizontal plane according to the depths of the ds z d s and vehicle z v see fig 7 the beacon depth is known a priori since it is measured during the ds deployment or by the internal pressure sensor installed in the ds which broadcasts measures through the acoustic modem likewise auv depth information is known very precisely from its pressure sensor only having to take into account the tide if necessary for which appropriate models are already available ray 1999 8 z k r n g r n g 2 z v z d s 2 during the estimation of the beacon position we rely on the on board dr navigation filter explained in section 3 the dr navigation drift is not taken into account because the time needed to localize the ds is small enough as demonstrated in vallicrosa and ridao 2016 where a 3d sum of gaussian sog filter with active localization al was used to successfully localize an acoustic beacon in a real scenario at known depth a range measurement describes a beacon as being in any position on a circumference around the auv with a radius equal to the projected range and thickness equal to the uncertainty of the measurement to cover this big space of possibilities one might use a particle filter pf to represent the static beacon position however the pf solution would leave empty spaces without coverage to avoid that a much larger number of particles could be used but then the problem would become computationally intractable a more elaborate option is the use of a sog filter blanco et al 2008 which is similar to the pf but uses weighted gaussians instead of weighted particles it represents the believed beacon position ℬ according to the odometry x k and the measurements z k r n g 9 p ℬ x k z k r n g i 1 n υ k i n z k r n g μ k i σ k i where υ k i is the weight associated with each gaussian and μ k i and σ k i its mean and covariance matrix the gaussians in the sog can cover all the probability space if they are correctly distributed moreover an ekf is used to correct their position according to the measurements thus improving its performance the sog is initialized with the first range measurement see fig 8 the filtering is carried out in two main steps first the range measurement is used to update each of the gaussians μ k i σ k i with an ekf second the weights are updated with the innovation of the ekf y k i z k r n g h r n g μ k i 10 υ k i υ k 1 i exp y k i 2 being i the index of the gaussian and υ k 1 the previous weight this computed weight is always in the 0 1 range the weights of the gaussians with a small innovation are significantly greater than those having a large innovation thus after some updates the gaussians which are not consistent with the observed ranges become negligible while those consistently compatible will influence the estimated pose of the beacon when the vehicle follows an observable path vaganay et al 2000 the beacon is localized in a few seconds in this work a simple approach using a star shaped trajectory is used to avoid symmetries and locate the beacon see fig 9 the trajectory is scaled proportionally to the first measured range and it is aborted as soon as the beacon is localized with an uncertainty below a user provided threshold the obtained localization of the ds after the star trajectory suffers from a large uncertainty on the tangent of the circumference defined by the range measurements see fig 10 to reduce this uncertainty before attempting to approach the ds the vehicle is commanded to a new waypoint computed on the principal axis of the localized beacon range updates obtained from this position further reduce the uncertainty of localization ending with a much better localization result 3 2 visual pose estimation acoustic localization can be very effective from medium to long distances but it is not so advantageous at short distances when high precision operation is required for successfully completing the docking maneuver to achieve a level of performance capable of ensuring the vehicle s safety during the terminal homing visual sensing is used to provide updates with small uncertainty and high update rates the proposed solution consists in placing a set of active light beacons in distinct and known positions of the ds see fig 11 using a standard camera it is possible to detect the lights in the images and estimate the pose between the ds and the camera it is worth noting that differently from range only localization this method is able to provide information on the relative orientation of the ds involving the full 6 dofs three relative translations and three rotations with the aim of facilitating the detection of the light beacons and avoiding wrong identifications the lights follow a known blinking pattern as explained in section 2 this pattern allows the actual lights to be correctly identified even in the presence of reflections or permanently illuminated areas in the scene the implemented detection technique is similar to the one detailed in bosch et al 2016 where we used it to track multiple auvs for cooperative navigation in real sea conditions and proved to be both effective and robust it is based on three main steps first there is a selection of candidate spots in the image based on gradient information then at every incoming frame the candidates are tracked taking into account the camera motion and we check its agreement along time with the known blinking pattern finally each candidate is associated with a beacon according to the known geometry of the beacons installed in the docking station when the four lights have been detected see fig 12 the relative landmark pose l ˆ of the ds that best fits the observation of the light beacons in the image q i is found using non linear least squares minimization this is done by searching for the values of the variable l that minimize the re projection error of the beacons that is the difference between the real observation and the projection of the light beacon derived from the variable l and the calibration parameters of the camera 11 l ˆ arg min l i n f l p i q i 2 the variable l contains the complete pose of the ds with respect to the camera l l x c l y c l z c l ϕ c l θ c l ψ c t the function f computes the image projection of each marker i given l and the position of the marker in the ds reference frame p i this function uses the pinhole camera model zhang 2000 hartley and zisserman 2004 and assumes known intrinsic calibration parameters although an approximate linear solution can be found for four or more light markers using a different pose parametrization we are interested in the above parametrization since it can be directly used in the docking problem the problem is solved with the levenberg marquardt algorithm available in the ceres library agarwal et al 2012 as with all iterative methods it needs an initial guess of the variables which can be approximated from the range measurements between acoustic modems further details on the pose estimation problem and its performance with a varying number of light beacons can be found in gracias et al 2015 for the proper operation of the navigation filter it is essential to have an estimate of the pose uncertainty a first order approximation of the pose covariance σ l ˆ can be computed from the assumed covariance σ q of the pixel location of the beacons in the image and from the jacobian j l ˆ q l l ˆ that relates small changes in the pose parameter with small changes in the observations the levenberg marquardt implementation provides an estimate of this jacobian at the end of the minimization the pose covariance estimate is given by 12 σ l ˆ j l ˆ t σ q 1 j l ˆ 1 the uncertainty obtained σ l ˆ excludes the uncertainty in the transformation between the camera and the auv and the uncertainty related with the camera calibration in order to have an approximate value of the uncertainty of the localization of a light in the image σ q we assume the detected lit region on the image follows a 2d gaussian distribution and that its area covers the 95 of lit pixels in other words we find an equivalent radius for the blob as it was a perfect circle and we assume this radius is 2σ after analysing multiple series of light beacon images gathered at different distances and lighting conditions this value has been set as constant for the range of operation of the detector σ 1 p i x e l a complementary system has been developed to help the vehicle in the last few meters of the terminal homing when due to the small distance to the ds the light beacons are not in the field of view of the camera this system consists in detecting augmented reality ar markers placed in known positions of the ds see fig 11 and estimating the relative pose of the ds in a analogous way as done with the light beacons notice that when the vehicle is well aligned to the docking during the terminal homing it is capable of docking reliably using only its own navigation and the last estimated pose of the ds obtained from the light beacons localization however in cases where there is significant navigation drift e g bad dvl readings due to slopes or rocky areas the vehicle might not present a good alignment with the dock entry therefore causing some light beacons to drop off the field of view in such situations the side markers become useful to locate the ds during the last meters it is important to note that the pose estimation based on ar markers is complementary but not a substitute to the light beacon approach given that it only works when there is ambient or artificial light to make the markers visible and that the distance under which the ar markers are detectable is significantly smaller see section 5 results the detection of the ar markers was done using the aruco library garrido jurado et al 2014 given that the library does not provide any uncertainty values on the location of the detected marker corners a conservative value of σ 2 p i x e l was chosen this uncertainty was then propagated in the same way as in the case of the light beacons to obtain σ l ˆ 4 vehicle operation and control the goal of the loon dock project is to have a vehicle persistently deployed so that a user can connect to it and use it remotely to carry out survey like missions therefore the user must be able to define upload and delete mission plans to the auv and start stop or abort its execution these plans have been defined to include the following motion commands go to a position keep the current position execute a lawnmower like trajectory and dock or undock moreover the user can request the auv position and state as well as information related with the auv payload in real time acoustic modems are used to carry out all these communications however when the auv is docked the user can download the data gathered in a previous mission using the wifi connection installed in the ds the following sections present the communication framework used to remotely operate the auv and the high level and low level controllers used to carry out the mission plans defined by the users 4 1 remote operation as shown in fig 13 a user can connect to the control pc in the loon test bed using the web based interface named sunrise gate petrioli et al 2014 passing through a virtual private network vpn and a gateway that ensure the privacy and security of the network alves et al 2014 the commands that the user executes through the web interface are received by the control pc and translated to sunset commands petrioli et al 2015 which is the protocol used for acoustic communications then they are sent through an acoustic node i e the modem mounted in the ds and wired to the control pc to another acoustic node i e the modem of the auv because the auv uses a ros based architecture quigley et al 2009 once it receives these commands they are translated from sunset to ros finally a wrapper module executes the necessary vehicle primitives available in the sparus ii control architecture named component oriented layer based architecture for autonomy cola2 palomeras et al 2012 both the sunrise gate and the sunset communications were previously developed in the context of the sunrise project therefore the main effort to allow the execution of remote commands to sparus ii auv has been to map the sunset commands to the primitives in the cola2 architecture used in the vehicle 4 2 auv guidance and control to execute the plans defined by a user the cola2 architecture implements a high level guidance module with the following motion commands keep position go to waypoint perform a survey like pattern and dock undock to achieve these motion commands the control architecture has a low level module including a velocity linear and angular and a pose position and orientation tracking control schemes see fig 14 the objective for the velocity control scheme is to minimize the error between a commanded velocity setpoint and the actual vehicle velocity analogously the pose tracking controller seeks to minimize the error between a desired pose setpoint and the actual vehicle pose both pose and velocity controllers generate an output force τ i that is merged with other forces that can be generated by other high level controllers e g safety controllers teleoperation etc the resulting force τ d must be then achieved by the vehicle thrusters to compute the thrust that each propeller must yield τ d is multiplied by the inverse of the thruster control matrix tcm being tcm a matrix that codifies the amount of force that each thruster produces per dof a complete description of the implemented low level controller module can be found in palomeras et al 2015 for an auv that runs the same architecture than sparus ii auv to implement the available motion commands the guidance module uses the pose and velocity control schemes as follows station keeping to keep the current position the pose of the auv in the moment to enable this motion command is sent as a desired setpoint to the pose controller go to waypoint to move the auv to a specific waypoint the guidance module computes the orientation error ψ e between the vehicle s current position and the desired waypoint and sends the desired yaw ψ d to the pose controller together with the desired depth z d when ψ e is smaller than a defined error the desired surge u d is computed proportionally to ψ e and a maximum speed and is sent to the velocity controller survey like pattern a lawn mower pattern is generated from the user input specifying the area to be covered i e three waypoints and the desired track spacing the generated transects are then followed using a line of sight los controller with cross tracking error los cte as the one described in fossen 2011 a proportional controller using the cross track error e in conjunction with the sideslip drift angle β 13 allows steady state convergence of the controller under constant currents see fig 15 the los cte controller sends the computed yaw reference ψ d and the desired depth z d to the pose controller while the desired constant surge velocity u d is achieved by the velocity control scheme 13 ψ d α k a r c t a n k p e β β a r c t a n 2 v y v x docking finally for the docking motion command the guidance module executes a state machine like the one presented in fig 16 i given an estimation of the ds position and orientation a waypoint 40 m in front of it is computed and the auv navigates to it en route notice that this point is only used to start sensing ranges from the modem and therefore the accurate positioning of the auv in that point is not critical it is set at 40 m in order to account for up to 30 m of navigation drift in this way there is enough margin to avoid potential collisions with the ds while still ensuring that ranges would be sensed with no problem even at shallow water i e less than 15 m depth ranges can be heard at more than 70 m distance in the event that no ranges were detected by the modem from this point the auv surfaces to get a gps update if possible and moves again to the computed location ii once ranges are available the acoustic localization algorithm see section 3 1 is enabled in order to estimate the ds position approach setup iii once the acoustic localization finalizes if a candidate position for the ds is obtained the auv is sent several meters in front of it and a visual based searching procedure consisting in turning the vehicle left and right while approaching the ds up to a safety distance is started to localize the light beacons approach home iv if the light beacons are localized see section 3 2 the ds landmark is initialized in the ekf slam filter and the vehicle is sent again to some distance with respect to the ds entrance to carry out the terminal homing this phase can be classified as a pose based visual servoing pbvs and contains two main steps see fig 17 move closer to the los path while not losing the visual contact with the ds and follow the los path until reaching the ds entrance initially if the vehicle is not aligned with the ds a series of movements might be required to position the robot in an appropriate location these maneuvers always try to keep the light beacons inside the camera fov using the position of both the auv and the ds estimated by the navigation filter in the second step the already presented los algorithm with cross tracking error los cte is executed to guide the auv up to the ds entrance if the auv gets out of the los approach area while getting closer to the ds it returns to the first step v if the terminal homing finalizes successfully the capture phase starts applying a force profile to the thrusters to gently introduce the vehicle inside the ds a similar force profile but on the opposite direction is applied to undock the vehicle if all phases conclude satisfactory to verify that the vehicle has been correctly docked several elements are considered a camera in the ds pointing to the funnel the wifi connection between the ds and the auv and also a test to check that the auv orientation is static despite applying some thrust if any of the phases fails the same phase or the previous one is repeated as shown in fig 16 if after three repetitions the phase keeps failing the docking command is aborted 5 experiments and results all the elements described in section 3 were tested incrementally preliminary tests were performed in a 16 8x5m water tank at the university of girona even though this water tank has a rather limited space it provides a convenient and controlled environment with a supervision room that offers direct view to the water in there we could test the light beacons localization the acoustic communications using sunset the vehicle remote operation from the sunrise gate and the final phases of the docking maneuver i e approach home terminal homing and capture later additional experiments were carried out in a harbour near girona the sog filter and further tests on the light beacon localization system were performed at this harbour under more real conditions once all the phases of the docking command were checked individually more complete tests involving survey trajectories started and or ended in the dock were carried out using the acoustic communications between the ds and the auv final experiments were performed at the loon testbed located in la spezia italy during a three day campaign fig 18 shows the location of the loon container where the loon control pc running the sunset gateway was located the blue area shows the region that was designated for conducting the experiments and where the ds was installed at around 9 m depth fifteen mission plans all of them including docking commands were executed by the auv at this testbed in all tests the ds was correctly detected and only in three 20 was not possible to conclude the docking maneuver due to the presence of strong water currents that affected the ds area during some hours in a direction that was not aligned with the docking station in two of these three cases after a predefined number of re attempts the system returned an error indicating that the docking could not be performed and in the remaining one the vehicle finalized the maneuver but detected that the vehicle was not correctly docked as described in section 2 the ds can rotate to be aligned with the water currents however in the ds current state this is a manual adjustment that has to be done by a diver when the current was aligned with the ds axis or was relatively low below 0 15 m s the docking maneuver was always successful despite very poor visibility below 3 m most of the time several tests were done to assess the remote operation of the vehicle first sunset commands were sent through the sunset user interface directly from the loon control pc once checked that the auv could be completely commanded by sending acoustic orders through the sunset protocol the vehicle was remotely operated through the sunrise gate web interface demonstrating the complete integration with the loon test bed see fig 19 the ds capability to latch the auv and to transmit large amounts of data once this was docked was also tested during the trials allowing to keep the auv docked in suspension mode for several hours as well as to transmit previously gathered data files up to 45mbits s fig 20 summarizes one of the full missions performed by the auv the vehicle started by undocking from the ds purple line and went to the first waypoint of the survey trajectory it executed the grid survey orange line while gathering multibeam data from 5 m altitude at the end of it the docking motion command was triggered even though the auv had left the ds and therefore it could receive acoustic range updates during the whole mission we forced the auv to localize the ds using the sog filter with al thus the auv started the star pattern trajectory that is performed to increase the observability of the ds ranges the range only localization process can be seen in more detail in fig 21 the algorithm starts by initializing a set of gaussians that cover all the position probability space fig 21a according to the first range measurement the vehicle initiates the star pattern trajectory and the incoming range measurements quickly narrow the probability of the ds position to two possible locations that are in agreement with all the received measurements fig 21b after performing the first turn new incoming ranges narrow down the uncertainty of the docking station position below the established threshold σ t h 1 5 at this point the vehicle moves to one side of the determined position in order to decrease the uncertainty of the ellipse down to σ d s 0 7 in its main axis fig 21c and d it is worth noting that this successful localization benefited from very consistent range measurements provided through sunset arriving every 5s range measurements can be affected by various types of non gaussian noise like surface bounces wrap returns and background noise yoerger et al 2007 in the presented experiments the measured ranges are not affected by those problems due to the small distance between the auv and the ds and because there were no obstacles in the vicinity leaving a direct reception for modem communication and range measurements this correct reception can be observed in fig 22 where measured ranges over time during the localization and approach to the ds show a smooth shape without outliers given the favorable conditions the range update rate was constant at 0 2 h z in the final approach to the docking station the optical tracking system is started in order to have a better precision on the ds location as well as a faster update rate at this point the docking command executes a search pattern in which the auv approaches the estimated position of the ds from 10 m to 4 m and every 2 m the auv performs a sweeping movement turning from 90deg to the left to 90deg to the right this behavior terminates when the ds is detected with this simple search pattern we ensure that the vision based system will be able to detect the light beacons even when the error in the sog filter estimation is up to 2 8 m i e 95 of cases when σ 0 7 the maximum distance of operation for the optical tracking depends strongly on the visibility conditions for this particular experiment the visibility was considered poor the structural elements of the ds were not visible at distances greater than 3 m however the light beacons could be properly detected up to a maximum distance of 7 m allowing to complete the docking approach without difficulty visibility conditions can be appreciated in fig 23 once the vision based system is able to estimate consistently several times the ds pose a landmark is initialized in the ekf localization system and every time that a new vision based measure or a range measure is obtained the position of both auv and ds is updated in the navigation filter see section 3 after introducing the landmark in the ekf the guidance module moves the auv to a waypoint placed 10 m in front of the ds pose available in the state vector and initializes the terminal homing phase while approaching the ds following the los path if the estimated distance by the optical tracking is under 1 5 m and there is ambient light the approach used to detect the ds changes and the algorithm tries to estimate the relative position of it using the ar markers instead of the light beacons when the system was on tracking mode it was able to provide updates at a maximum of 15 h z which corresponds to the capture frame rate of the camera because acoustic ranges light beacons and ar marker measurements are equally used to update the ds position in the ekf slam filter the position of these three elements with respect to the ds frame must be properly calibrated fig 24 compares the distance between the auv and the ds estimated according to the acoustic ranges light beacons and ar markers all methods show a high degree of agreement with the trajectory estimated offline once the ds position was known precisely with differences smaller than 30 cm the background colors in the plot represent the number of light beacons inside the fov of the camera this is depending on the orientation of the auv a different number of light beacons are inside the fov of the camera due to the fact that the orientation of the ds is known a priori even when only two of the light beacons have been identified it is possible to estimate the relative pose for this particular mission the optical track was lost between seconds 15 to 25 due to a reorientation of the auv to correctly approach the ds from second 45 onwards when the distance is smaller than 1 5 m the optical tracking was based on ar markers from the plot we can conclude that the optical tracking worked when the lights were in the camera fov and in a distance of less than 7 m the tracking was lost at 1 5 m moment in which the tracking method changed to ar markers detection the uncertainty of the ds position according to the visual estimates is shown in fig 25 the plot includes the uncertainty in the detection of the ds in the image but excludes the uncertainty in the transformation between the camera and the auv and the uncertainty related with the camera calibration peaks in the uncertainty plot appear when only two or three lights are visible instead of four fig 26 shows the bathymetric data collected along several survey missions that were autonomously commanded and executed in different locations although the data might not be very valuable in terms of mapping utility because the area was extremely flat and with scarcity of features it serves as a proof of concept and testifies to the whole concept of the loon dock being able to remotely command and retrieve large amounts of data from a persistently deployed auv through a ds 6 conclusions and future work this paper has presented the docking solution implemented in the context of the loon dock project in order to demonstrate the remote operation and data transmission of a survey auv from internet we have designed and built a docking station for sparus ii auv providing passive and active guidance mechanisms a latching system high bandwidth data communications and visual feedback the active guidance for docking is based on two complementary and cost effective systems two acoustic modems using only range information within a sog filter to detect the ds from mid distances and a vision based system composed of a set of light beacons and visual markers used in the terminal homing phase the combination of a mid accuracy mid range method with a high accuracy short range method allows us to reliably dock the auv the system has been extensively tested with trials ranging from a controlled water tank environment to more realistic sea operation conditions successful validation of all the involved parts i e auv navigation control acoustic communications and autonomous docking capabilities has been conducted despite the presence of currents and very poor water visibility the main downside identified in our docking approach arises in the presence of strong water currents that are not aligned with the docking station sparus ii being a torpedo shaped vehicle underactuated in sway can only deal with lateral currents by changing its heading this has two negative effects first by adapting the heading to compensate the currents the vehicle is more prone to lose sight of the light beacons during the terminal homing and second if the misalignment with the docking is larger than 30 the vehicle cannot physically enter inside the funnel receptacle for this reason as a future work it is important to deal with the automatic alignment of the ds with the currents notice that the proposed design is already able to rotate the ds funnel receptacle and only a system to measure the water currents and an actuator to move it accordingly would have to be added besides a battery recharging mechanism will be also integrated in the future to complete the system and enable its persistent deployment through longer time spans acknowledgement this work was supported by the eu funded project loon dock sunrise sensing monitoring and actuating in the underwater world through a federated research infrastructure extending the future internet fp7 ict 2013 10 611449 
23514,one of the major goals of the sunrise fp7 project is to make the underwater internet of things a reality in this context the loon dock project presented here extends the existing litoral ocean observatory network testbed with a docking station tailored to the sparus ii auv the docking system allows a remote user to program survey like missions through a web based interface as well as to retrieve the data gathered by the auv once a mission finalizes to enable the autonomous docking of the auv two complementary and cost effective localization systems have been developed the first one implements a range only localization algorithm to approach the docking station while the second based on active light beacons provides high accuracy at short ranges to complete the docking maneuver the system has been extensively tested in different trials from a controlled water tank environment to more realistic sea operation conditions proving its viability despite very poor water visibility conditions keywords auv docking station acoustic localization visual tracking remote operation 1 introduction the increased number of deployed subsea systems infrastructures sensors robots gliders and others during the last years is raising the need for interconnection among themselves and to the exterior world for a better management and exploitation this is one of the major goals of the sunrise fp7 project petrioli et al 2013 which is devoted to make the underwater internet of things uiot a reality connecting the underwater systems to the network and endowing them with the capability of making their data widely accessible while minimizing the need of human interaction has the potential of providing ocean data at an unprecedented scale persistent deployment of buoyancy driven vehicles gliders in open waters has already been achieved for periods of time spanning months manley and willcox 2010 meyer 2016 however persistent deployment of survey type autonomous underwater vehicles auvs capable of more complex mapping missions is a challenging problem that arises the requirement of docking the objective behind the docking concept is to extend the deployment time by installing a docking station ds that allows to extract the data of finished missions program new missions and recharge the batteries of the vehicle without recovering it at the surface the first systems were designed for oceanographic sampling purposes curtin et al 1993 singh et al 2001 more recently the interest has grown towards using auvs in commercial scenarios for the periodic inspection and maintenance of subsea installations brignone et al 2007 krupinski et al 2008 jacobson et al 2013 in addition a significant part of docking related works have emerged from operational environments where launch and recovery is a difficult task such as under ice operations king et al 2009 however despite many demonstrations have taken place since the 90 s the combined need of infrastructure physical mounting power communications and the demanding vehicle reliability required to operate continuously without human servicing still makes docking a state of the art problem bellingham 2016 in the context of the sunrise project the loon dock project presented here aims to extend the existing litoral ocean observatory network loon testbed alves et al 2014 with a ds to demonstrate data transmission from a survey auv to the internet the idea is to be able to remotely operate the auv from the sunrise gate petrioli et al 2014 a web interface created to remotely schedule experiments using assets persistently deployed in different testbed facilities around the world for the auvs to really become part of the uiot it is essential to provide docking solutions that are cost effective while maintaining the performance and reliability of the system in this sense our proposal strives to keep the implemented docking approach low cost in all the addressed aspects namely the mechanical design the communications and the autonomous docking procedure the power transference to the auv is not covered in the scope of this work however it is worth noting that solutions for wireless inductive power transference already exist in the market and could be integrated at a certain cost from the hardware point of view the developed ds is based on a funnel shaped receptacle which is a traditional solution cowen et al 1997 allen et al 2006 mcewen et al 2008 to physically guide the vehicle into the dock another common design found in the literature are the vertical dock poles singh et al 2001 stone et al 2010 that allow the vehicle to approach from any direction making them more robust to changing water disturbances to alleviate the directionality constrain the funnel receptacle has been designed so that it can pivot over the static base and be oriented according to the water currents of the environment compared to a pole dock the funnel shaped design eases the installation of the necessary equipment to support the communications and the homing maneuvers facilitates the establishment of links with the vehicle and protects the auv against environmental hazards while docked with regards to communications the developed docking system is directly connected to the internet through the loon infrastructure and features two modes of communication with the auv the first mode uses an acoustic modem and the sunset protocol petrioli et al 2015 a lightweight networking framework well suited for underwater acoustic communications the second mode intended for when the auv is docked is based on a contactless wifi module installed in the ds which is crucial to transfer at high speed the vast amounts of data that a survey auv can gather in a mission the use of a contactless radio frequency module based on a commercial off the shelf cots wifi modem provides a reliable and low cost data transmission system mcewen et al 2008 capable of achieving transfer speeds in the order of tens of mbps it does not require the mating of connectors underwater thus preventing the exposure of electrical contacts and provides a less sensitive alignment with respect to establishing direct electrical connections stokey et al 2001 or inductive coupling feezor et al 2001 to assist the autonomous docking procedure the ds employs the acoustic modem as a range only transponder for mid range homing and a set of light beacons installed in the funnel entrance for the terminal phase of the docking the autonomous docking is tackled from the general scenario in which the vehicle does not know the exact position of the ds usually because it has lost the communication with the ds during a mission execution and only has an a priori coarse estimate of its position then following the nomenclature established in bellingham 2016 our proposed approach for autonomous docking works as follows see fig 1 first the vehicle starts from an en route phase that gets the vehicle close enough so it can sense the ds with the on board acoustic transponder this navigation is performed according to the on board navigation filter that merges information from different sensors to navigate relative to the earth next in the approach setup phase a range only localization filter is used to estimate the ds location while the auv is guided along an observable trajectory once an estimation of the ds position becomes known the vehicle approaches the ds to bring it within visual reach i e approach phase the light beacon navigation system is used to estimate the ds pose with respect to the auv on board camera visual information is used to update a single landmark simultaneous localization and mapping filter that provides the relative position between the auv and the ds with the accuracy required for the terminal homing phase preliminary versions of these two localization algorithms have been previously reported in a simulation environment vallicrosa et al 2016 in order to back up the visual localization during the very last few meters of the approach when the light beacons are no longer inside the camera field of view a complementary system has been integrated using augmented reality ar markers garrido jurado et al 2014 after this phase the auv ends up inside the docking funnel and is guided up to the latch mechanism by controlling the generated forward thrust i e capture phase existing solutions to perform autonomous docking usually rely in more complex acoustic sensors including usbl mcewen et al 2008 allen et al 2006 or inverted sbl setups smith and kronen 1997 optical sensors have also been explored for the terminal phase with solutions comprising either active light sources with single cowen et al 1997 murarka et al 2009 li et al 2015 2016 or multi light systems hong et al 2003 park et al 2009 or passive patterns and markers kushnerik et al 2009 maire et al 2009 that can be detected by on board cameras altogether our approach provides an hierarchical homing procedure that ensures a reliable approach and terminal homing maneuvers enabled with low cost equipment and minimal requirements on both the vehicle and the ds sides notice that indeed the acoustic ranging and optical image acquisition are capabilities that either already exist in most auvs or can be easily added at a reasonable cost the same reasoning applies to the docking station since the light beacon system and the ar markers are relatively inexpensive to manufacture the reminder of this paper is organized as follows next section describes in more detail the employed auv and the design of the proposed docking station section 3 introduces the navigation system of the auv together with the developed algorithms for autonomous docking including both the range only localization and the visual localization of the ds section 4 covers the insights about operation and control involving the remote operation through the sunrise web based interface and the auv guidance module that controls the various phases of the autonomous docking section 5 presents the experiments that have been performed together with an analysis of the results obtained with the system fully integrated in the loon infrastructure finally section 6 reports the conclusions and points out future work directions 2 hardware the ds has been designed especially for the sparus ii auv carreras et al 2013 see fig 2 sparus ii auv is a lightweight i e 50 kg torpedo shaped vehicle with partial hovering capabilities it has two horizontal and one vertical thrusters allowing surge heave and yaw movements and a mission specific payload area its flexibility and easy operation makes the sparus ii auv a multipurpose platform adaptable to a high variety of mapping applications in shallow water i e up to 200 m the ds provides active and passive guidance for docking a latching mechanism to maintain the vehicle docked while in standby mode high bandwidth data communications and visual feedback the ds has been designed to be as small as possible and lightweight for easy transportation deployment and recovery it is constructed mainly from corrosion resistance aluminium and polyoxymethylene pom the structure consists of two main parts the docking part and the base see fig 3 the entrance of the docking part has fourteen funnel shaped rails that passively guide the vehicle to the dock position using vehicle s thrust the size of the funnel can handle translation misalignment of 40 cm and rails arrangement can correct vehicle misalignment s in roll and pitch up to 30deg rail guides are made from flexible pom which can absorb collisions thus minimizing vehicle back bouncing the base connects with the docking part with a single axis rotation mechanism that allows the docking part to align with water currents without moving the base current implementation requires manual input for the rotation i e by using a diver however in the future an active automatic mechanism will be implemented the base feet can be adjusted up to 20 cm in height in order to level the ds and accommodate ballast weights to keep the centre of gravity low a latching system see fig 4 has been developed to prevent the vehicle from exiting the ds due to water currents thus allowing it to enter in low power mode once docked when the vehicle has entered the ds in its final position two claws grip on the antenna does not allow the auv to exit the operation of the claws is controlled from a servo motor there is a solid join between the motor and the right claw and from this the motion is propagated to the left claw via flexible wires the servo motor when activated has enough torque to withstand opening forces if the vehicle tries to exit due to water currents or even with its thrusters however if it is deactivated such in the event of a ds power loss the claws are disengaged and with relatively small thrust the auv can safely exit two active systems provide mid and short range localization information to the auv in order to guide it to the ds using the algorithms that will be described in section 3 for mid range detection an evologics acoustic modem is installed on the top of the ds performing two main functions a transponder function providing range measurements for homing and a modem function to monitor the auv during survey operations and to allow the user to send basic commands to the auv remotely for short range guidance when the ds is within the auv visual range of its camera light beacons are used to provide localization aid there are four beacons installed around the entrance ring in a symmetrical fashion each individual light beacon consists of five high intensity leds to create a homogeneous lighting effect inside a waterproof housing see fig 5 each beacon provides flashing light at approximately 110deg field of view fov fov at 1 hz period with 90 on 10 off duty cycle the system is operated at 24 v and the maximum power consumption is 22 w when all markers are lit the beacons can be remotely activated from top side two high bandwidth data communications interfaces have been included in the ds one between the top side and the ds and one between the ds and the auv it is very common to install the ds in long distance from the top side base establishing communications between them can be achieved either by wireless connection via a surface buoy or by fixed wire given that in the area where the system was demonstrated i e the loon testbed there are restrictions for installing permanent surface buoys we chose to implement a wired connection with a long cable laying on the seafloor nevertheless the ds can be easily modified to support wireless connection for the wired communication scheme we are using vdsl2 technology it supports via a single twisted pair up to 100mbit s downstream rates at 500 m and graduate decreasing to 1 4mbit s over distances of 4 5 km we have also included an ethernet connection though it can only be reliably used for distances shorter than 100 m for the auv to ds communication a wifi modem has been adapted to fit in a waterproof housing and is positioned on the latching mechanism when the auv is docked its wifi antenna is close enough to the modem 7 cm to allow a strong wireless data link with this system we are able to communicate with up to 45mbit s between the auv and the top side on the ds there is a watertight container that houses all the necessary electronic components for its operation that includes a pressure sensor an inertial measurement unit imu and an ethernet switch connecting the evologics modem the wifi modem and a raspberry pi 3 single board computer the raspberry pi 3 is locally running ros quigley et al 2009 and provides control for the latch mechanism and the leds it is also in charge to broadcast through the modem the ds depth and orientations obtained from the imu in order to check that the ds has been properly leveled during its installation besides there is also a webcam that points to the center of ds imaging the auv when it is docked there is also an independent underwater analog video camera that is placed on the side of the ds providing a general overview of the ds and the auv when approaching the ds is connected to top side via two independent cables one for power and one for data to minimize electromagnetic interferences it is powered with 220vac via an isolation transformer in order to minimize power loss the data cable is an ethernet cat 5e cable where one pair is used for the vdsl2 one for the analog video and the last four are used for the short range ethernet link 3 auv navigation and ds localization the navigation filter of the sparus ii auv is based on the well known extended kalman filter ekf it combines the information on depth returned by the pressure sensor velocities from the doppler velocity log dvl and attitude from the attitude and heading reference system ahrs to provide a dead reckoning dr navigation this navigation drifts over time and needs absolute measurements to correct it those measurements can come from either global positioning system gps when on surface ultra short base line usbl or acoustic ranges or visual detections with respect to a known landmark see fig 6 a feature based ekf slam navigation filter is used in the proposed scenario where the only landmark will be the ds the state vector for the implemented filter is the following 1 x x y z u v w l 1 l n where x y z and u v w are the position and linear velocity vectors of the auv and l i is the landmark i pose vector defined as 2 l i l x i l y i l z i l ϕ i l θ i l ψ i because range only measurements cannot estimate the landmark orientation a landmark must be initialized by a visual detection however once in the state vector both range only and visual based updates can be applied the navigation filter uses a constant velocity model with attitude input 3 x ˆ k x k 1 y k 1 z k 1 ℛ ϕ k θ k ψ k u k 1 v k 1

the filter input u k each sensor measurement is modelled as 4 z k h x ˆ k s k where z k is the measurement itself h is the observation matrix that relates the state vector with the sensor measurement h x ˆ k if the measurement is not linear and s k is the sensor noise to differentiate between range and light beacon measurements we will use z k r n g h r n g and z k l b h l b respectively in case of range only measurements the observation equation provides the expected range measurement h r n g x ˆ k which is given by the norm of the difference between the vehicle and beacon positions at time

inertial frame and ℛ ϕ k θ k ψ k is the vehicle orientation rotation matrix at time k when the position of the ds is unknown or known with a high uncertainty the range only localization method described in section 3 1 is used to obtain an approximate location once the vehicle homes to the vicinity of the ds the light beacon detection system will be used to initialize the landmark in the ekf slam navigation filter and to provide accurate updates see section 3 2 3 1 ds range only localization range only localization is a highly non linear problem given 1d measurements range the vehicle must be localized in a higher dimensional space 3d with an unknown position of the beacon and after the first measurement the probability distribution has the shape of a spherical shell with thickness equal to the range measurement uncertainty kalman filter kf represents a location as a gaussian with a mean and a covariance matrix that can be used to express a location as a sphere but not as a spherical shell therefore the use of kf is not appropriate for this problem several range only localization methods have been reported in the literature vaganay et al 2000 newman and leonard 2003 olson et al 2006 webster et al 2009 wang et al 2013 blanco et al 2008 however those methods are demonstrated offline after the vehicle is recovered and no online localization is performed in order to simplify the problem from 3d localization to 2d we project the measured ranges r n g 8 to the horizontal plane according to the depths of the ds z d s and vehicle z v see fig 7 the beacon depth is known a priori since it is measured during the ds deployment or by the internal pressure sensor installed in the ds which broadcasts measures through the acoustic modem likewise auv depth information is known very precisely from its pressure sensor only having to take into account the tide if necessary for which appropriate models are already available ray 1999 8 z k r n g r n g 2 z v z d s 2 during the estimation of the beacon position we rely on the on board dr navigation filter explained in section 3 the dr navigation drift is not taken into account because the time needed to localize the ds is small enough as demonstrated in vallicrosa and ridao 2016 where a 3d sum of gaussian sog filter with active localization al was used to successfully localize an acoustic beacon in a real scenario at known depth a range measurement describes a beacon as being in any position on a circumference around the auv with a radius equal to the projected range and thickness equal to the uncertainty of the measurement to cover this big space of possibilities one might use a particle filter pf to represent the static beacon position however the pf solution would leave empty spaces without coverage to avoid that a much larger number of particles could be used but then the problem would become computationally intractable a more elaborate option is the use of a sog filter blanco et al 2008 which is similar to the pf but uses weighted gaussians instead of weighted particles it represents the believed beacon position ℬ according to the odometry x k and the measurements z k r n g 9 p ℬ x k z k r n g i 1 n υ k i n z k r n g μ k i σ k i where υ k i is the weight associated with each gaussian and μ k i and σ k i its mean and covariance matrix the gaussians in the sog can cover all the probability space if they are correctly distributed moreover an ekf is used to correct their position according to the measurements thus improving its performance the sog is initialized with the first range measurement see fig 8 the filtering is carried out in two main steps first the range measurement is used to update each of the gaussians μ k i σ k i with an ekf second the weights are updated with the innovation of the ekf y k i z k r n g h r n g μ k i 10 υ k i υ k 1 i exp y k i 2 being i the index of the gaussian and υ k 1 the previous weight this computed weight is always in the 0 1 range the weights of the gaussians with a small innovation are significantly greater than those having a large innovation thus after some updates the gaussians which are not consistent with the observed ranges become negligible while those consistently compatible will influence the estimated pose of the beacon when the vehicle follows an observable path vaganay et al 2000 the beacon is localized in a few seconds in this work a simple approach using a star shaped trajectory is used to avoid symmetries and locate the beacon see fig 9 the trajectory is scaled proportionally to the first measured range and it is aborted as soon as the beacon is localized with an uncertainty below a user provided threshold the obtained localization of the ds after the star trajectory suffers from a large uncertainty on the tangent of the circumference defined by the range measurements see fig 10 to reduce this uncertainty before attempting to approach the ds the vehicle is commanded to a new waypoint computed on the principal axis of the localized beacon range updates obtained from this position further reduce the uncertainty of localization ending with a much better localization result 3 2 visual pose estimation acoustic localization can be very effective from medium to long distances but it is not so advantageous at short distances when high precision operation is required for successfully completing the docking maneuver to achieve a level of performance capable of ensuring the vehicle s safety during the terminal homing visual sensing is used to provide updates with small uncertainty and high update rates the proposed solution consists in placing a set of active light beacons in distinct and known positions of the ds see fig 11 using a standard camera it is possible to detect the lights in the images and estimate the pose between the ds and the camera it is worth noting that differently from range only localization this method is able to provide information on the relative orientation of the ds involving the full 6 dofs three relative translations and three rotations with the aim of facilitating the detection of the light beacons and avoiding wrong identifications the lights follow a known blinking pattern as explained in section 2 this pattern allows the actual lights to be correctly identified even in the presence of reflections or permanently illuminated areas in the scene the implemented detection technique is similar to the one detailed in bosch et al 2016 where we used it to track multiple auvs for cooperative navigation in real sea conditions and proved to be both effective and robust it is based on three main steps first there is a selection of candidate spots in the image based on gradient information then at every incoming frame the candidates are tracked taking into account the camera motion and we check its agreement along time with the known blinking pattern finally each candidate is associated with a beacon according to the known geometry of the beacons installed in the docking station when the four lights have been detected see fig 12 the relative landmark pose l ˆ of the ds that best fits the observation of the light beacons in the image q i is found using non linear least squares minimization this is done by searching for the values of the variable l that minimize the re projection error of the beacons that is the difference between the real observation and the projection of the light beacon derived from the variable l and the calibration parameters of the camera 11 l ˆ arg min l i n f l p i q i 2 the variable l contains the complete pose of the ds with respect to the camera l l x c l y c l z c l ϕ c l θ c l ψ c t the function f computes the image projection of each marker i given l and the position of the marker in the ds reference frame p i this function uses the pinhole camera model zhang 2000 hartley and zisserman 2004 and assumes known intrinsic calibration parameters although an approximate linear solution can be found for four or more light markers using a different pose parametrization we are interested in the above parametrization since it can be directly used in the docking problem the problem is solved with the levenberg marquardt algorithm available in the ceres library agarwal et al 2012 as with all iterative methods it needs an initial guess of the variables which can be approximated from the range measurements between acoustic modems further details on the pose estimation problem and its performance with a varying number of light beacons can be found in gracias et al 2015 for the proper operation of the navigation filter it is essential to have an estimate of the pose uncertainty a first order approximation of the pose covariance σ l ˆ can be computed from the assumed covariance σ q of the pixel location of the beacons in the image and from the jacobian j l ˆ q l l ˆ that relates small changes in the pose parameter with small changes in the observations the levenberg marquardt implementation provides an estimate of this jacobian at the end of the minimization the pose covariance estimate is given by 12 σ l ˆ j l ˆ t σ q 1 j l ˆ 1 the uncertainty obtained σ l ˆ excludes the uncertainty in the transformation between the camera and the auv and the uncertainty related with the camera calibration in order to have an approximate value of the uncertainty of the localization of a light in the image σ q we assume the detected lit region on the image follows a 2d gaussian distribution and that its area covers the 95 of lit pixels in other words we find an equivalent radius for the blob as it was a perfect circle and we assume this radius is 2σ after analysing multiple series of light beacon images gathered at different distances and lighting conditions this value has been set as constant for the range of operation of the detector σ 1 p i x e l a complementary system has been developed to help the vehicle in the last few meters of the terminal homing when due to the small distance to the ds the light beacons are not in the field of view of the camera this system consists in detecting augmented reality ar markers placed in known positions of the ds see fig 11 and estimating the relative pose of the ds in a analogous way as done with the light beacons notice that when the vehicle is well aligned to the docking during the terminal homing it is capable of docking reliably using only its own navigation and the last estimated pose of the ds obtained from the light beacons localization however in cases where there is significant navigation drift e g bad dvl readings due to slopes or rocky areas the vehicle might not present a good alignment with the dock entry therefore causing some light beacons to drop off the field of view in such situations the side markers become useful to locate the ds during the last meters it is important to note that the pose estimation based on ar markers is complementary but not a substitute to the light beacon approach given that it only works when there is ambient or artificial light to make the markers visible and that the distance under which the ar markers are detectable is significantly smaller see section 5 results the detection of the ar markers was done using the aruco library garrido jurado et al 2014 given that the library does not provide any uncertainty values on the location of the detected marker corners a conservative value of σ 2 p i x e l was chosen this uncertainty was then propagated in the same way as in the case of the light beacons to obtain σ l ˆ 4 vehicle operation and control the goal of the loon dock project is to have a vehicle persistently deployed so that a user can connect to it and use it remotely to carry out survey like missions therefore the user must be able to define upload and delete mission plans to the auv and start stop or abort its execution these plans have been defined to include the following motion commands go to a position keep the current position execute a lawnmower like trajectory and dock or undock moreover the user can request the auv position and state as well as information related with the auv payload in real time acoustic modems are used to carry out all these communications however when the auv is docked the user can download the data gathered in a previous mission using the wifi connection installed in the ds the following sections present the communication framework used to remotely operate the auv and the high level and low level controllers used to carry out the mission plans defined by the users 4 1 remote operation as shown in fig 13 a user can connect to the control pc in the loon test bed using the web based interface named sunrise gate petrioli et al 2014 passing through a virtual private network vpn and a gateway that ensure the privacy and security of the network alves et al 2014 the commands that the user executes through the web interface are received by the control pc and translated to sunset commands petrioli et al 2015 which is the protocol used for acoustic communications then they are sent through an acoustic node i e the modem mounted in the ds and wired to the control pc to another acoustic node i e the modem of the auv because the auv uses a ros based architecture quigley et al 2009 once it receives these commands they are translated from sunset to ros finally a wrapper module executes the necessary vehicle primitives available in the sparus ii control architecture named component oriented layer based architecture for autonomy cola2 palomeras et al 2012 both the sunrise gate and the sunset communications were previously developed in the context of the sunrise project therefore the main effort to allow the execution of remote commands to sparus ii auv has been to map the sunset commands to the primitives in the cola2 architecture used in the vehicle 4 2 auv guidance and control to execute the plans defined by a user the cola2 architecture implements a high level guidance module with the following motion commands keep position go to waypoint perform a survey like pattern and dock undock to achieve these motion commands the control architecture has a low level module including a velocity linear and angular and a pose position and orientation tracking control schemes see fig 14 the objective for the velocity control scheme is to minimize the error between a commanded velocity setpoint and the actual vehicle velocity analogously the pose tracking controller seeks to minimize the error between a desired pose setpoint and the actual vehicle pose both pose and velocity controllers generate an output force τ i that is merged with other forces that can be generated by other high level controllers e g safety controllers teleoperation etc the resulting force τ d must be then achieved by the vehicle thrusters to compute the thrust that each propeller must yield τ d is multiplied by the inverse of the thruster control matrix tcm being tcm a matrix that codifies the amount of force that each thruster produces per dof a complete description of the implemented low level controller module can be found in palomeras et al 2015 for an auv that runs the same architecture than sparus ii auv to implement the available motion commands the guidance module uses the pose and velocity control schemes as follows station keeping to keep the current position the pose of the auv in the moment to enable this motion command is sent as a desired setpoint to the pose controller go to waypoint to move the auv to a specific waypoint the guidance module computes the orientation error ψ e between the vehicle s current position and the desired waypoint and sends the desired yaw ψ d to the pose controller together with the desired depth z d when ψ e is smaller than a defined error the desired surge u d is computed proportionally to ψ e and a maximum speed and is sent to the velocity controller survey like pattern a lawn mower pattern is generated from the user input specifying the area to be covered i e three waypoints and the desired track spacing the generated transects are then followed using a line of sight los controller with cross tracking error los cte as the one described in fossen 2011 a proportional controller using the cross track error e in conjunction with the sideslip drift angle β 13 allows steady state convergence of the controller under constant currents see fig 15 the los cte controller sends the computed yaw reference ψ d and the desired depth z d to the pose controller while the desired constant surge velocity u d is achieved by the velocity control scheme 13 ψ d α k a r c t a n k p e β β a r c t a n 2 v y v x docking finally for the docking motion command the guidance module executes a state machine like the one presented in fig 16 i given an estimation of the ds position and orientation a waypoint 40 m in front of it is computed and the auv navigates to it en route notice that this point is only used to start sensing ranges from the modem and therefore the accurate positioning of the auv in that point is not critical it is set at 40 m in order to account for up to 30 m of navigation drift in this way there is enough margin to avoid potential collisions with the ds while still ensuring that ranges would be sensed with no problem even at shallow water i e less than 15 m depth ranges can be heard at more than 70 m distance in the event that no ranges were detected by the modem from this point the auv surfaces to get a gps update if possible and moves again to the computed location ii once ranges are available the acoustic localization algorithm see section 3 1 is enabled in order to estimate the ds position approach setup iii once the acoustic localization finalizes if a candidate position for the ds is obtained the auv is sent several meters in front of it and a visual based searching procedure consisting in turning the vehicle left and right while approaching the ds up to a safety distance is started to localize the light beacons approach home iv if the light beacons are localized see section 3 2 the ds landmark is initialized in the ekf slam filter and the vehicle is sent again to some distance with respect to the ds entrance to carry out the terminal homing this phase can be classified as a pose based visual servoing pbvs and contains two main steps see fig 17 move closer to the los path while not losing the visual contact with the ds and follow the los path until reaching the ds entrance initially if the vehicle is not aligned with the ds a series of movements might be required to position the robot in an appropriate location these maneuvers always try to keep the light beacons inside the camera fov using the position of both the auv and the ds estimated by the navigation filter in the second step the already presented los algorithm with cross tracking error los cte is executed to guide the auv up to the ds entrance if the auv gets out of the los approach area while getting closer to the ds it returns to the first step v if the terminal homing finalizes successfully the capture phase starts applying a force profile to the thrusters to gently introduce the vehicle inside the ds a similar force profile but on the opposite direction is applied to undock the vehicle if all phases conclude satisfactory to verify that the vehicle has been correctly docked several elements are considered a camera in the ds pointing to the funnel the wifi connection between the ds and the auv and also a test to check that the auv orientation is static despite applying some thrust if any of the phases fails the same phase or the previous one is repeated as shown in fig 16 if after three repetitions the phase keeps failing the docking command is aborted 5 experiments and results all the elements described in section 3 were tested incrementally preliminary tests were performed in a 16 8x5m water tank at the university of girona even though this water tank has a rather limited space it provides a convenient and controlled environment with a supervision room that offers direct view to the water in there we could test the light beacons localization the acoustic communications using sunset the vehicle remote operation from the sunrise gate and the final phases of the docking maneuver i e approach home terminal homing and capture later additional experiments were carried out in a harbour near girona the sog filter and further tests on the light beacon localization system were performed at this harbour under more real conditions once all the phases of the docking command were checked individually more complete tests involving survey trajectories started and or ended in the dock were carried out using the acoustic communications between the ds and the auv final experiments were performed at the loon testbed located in la spezia italy during a three day campaign fig 18 shows the location of the loon container where the loon control pc running the sunset gateway was located the blue area shows the region that was designated for conducting the experiments and where the ds was installed at around 9 m depth fifteen mission plans all of them including docking commands were executed by the auv at this testbed in all tests the ds was correctly detected and only in three 20 was not possible to conclude the docking maneuver due to the presence of strong water currents that affected the ds area during some hours in a direction that was not aligned with the docking station in two of these three cases after a predefined number of re attempts the system returned an error indicating that the docking could not be performed and in the remaining one the vehicle finalized the maneuver but detected that the vehicle was not correctly docked as described in section 2 the ds can rotate to be aligned with the water currents however in the ds current state this is a manual adjustment that has to be done by a diver when the current was aligned with the ds axis or was relatively low below 0 15 m s the docking maneuver was always successful despite very poor visibility below 3 m most of the time several tests were done to assess the remote operation of the vehicle first sunset commands were sent through the sunset user interface directly from the loon control pc once checked that the auv could be completely commanded by sending acoustic orders through the sunset protocol the vehicle was remotely operated through the sunrise gate web interface demonstrating the complete integration with the loon test bed see fig 19 the ds capability to latch the auv and to transmit large amounts of data once this was docked was also tested during the trials allowing to keep the auv docked in suspension mode for several hours as well as to transmit previously gathered data files up to 45mbits s fig 20 summarizes one of the full missions performed by the auv the vehicle started by undocking from the ds purple line and went to the first waypoint of the survey trajectory it executed the grid survey orange line while gathering multibeam data from 5 m altitude at the end of it the docking motion command was triggered even though the auv had left the ds and therefore it could receive acoustic range updates during the whole mission we forced the auv to localize the ds using the sog filter with al thus the auv started the star pattern trajectory that is performed to increase the observability of the ds ranges the range only localization process can be seen in more detail in fig 21 the algorithm starts by initializing a set of gaussians that cover all the position probability space fig 21a according to the first range measurement the vehicle initiates the star pattern trajectory and the incoming range measurements quickly narrow the probability of the ds position to two possible locations that are in agreement with all the received measurements fig 21b after performing the first turn new incoming ranges narrow down the uncertainty of the docking station position below the established threshold σ t h 1 5 at this point the vehicle moves to one side of the determined position in order to decrease the uncertainty of the ellipse down to σ d s 0 7 in its main axis fig 21c and d it is worth noting that this successful localization benefited from very consistent range measurements provided through sunset arriving every 5s range measurements can be affected by various types of non gaussian noise like surface bounces wrap returns and background noise yoerger et al 2007 in the presented experiments the measured ranges are not affected by those problems due to the small distance between the auv and the ds and because there were no obstacles in the vicinity leaving a direct reception for modem communication and range measurements this correct reception can be observed in fig 22 where measured ranges over time during the localization and approach to the ds show a smooth shape without outliers given the favorable conditions the range update rate was constant at 0 2 h z in the final approach to the docking station the optical tracking system is started in order to have a better precision on the ds location as well as a faster update rate at this point the docking command executes a search pattern in which the auv approaches the estimated position of the ds from 10 m to 4 m and every 2 m the auv performs a sweeping movement turning from 90deg to the left to 90deg to the right this behavior terminates when the ds is detected with this simple search pattern we ensure that the vision based system will be able to detect the light beacons even when the error in the sog filter estimation is up to 2 8 m i e 95 of cases when σ 0 7 the maximum distance of operation for the optical tracking depends strongly on the visibility conditions for this particular experiment the visibility was considered poor the structural elements of the ds were not visible at distances greater than 3 m however the light beacons could be properly detected up to a maximum distance of 7 m allowing to complete the docking approach without difficulty visibility conditions can be appreciated in fig 23 once the vision based system is able to estimate consistently several times the ds pose a landmark is initialized in the ekf localization system and every time that a new vision based measure or a range measure is obtained the position of both auv and ds is updated in the navigation filter see section 3 after introducing the landmark in the ekf the guidance module moves the auv to a waypoint placed 10 m in front of the ds pose available in the state vector and initializes the terminal homing phase while approaching the ds following the los path if the estimated distance by the optical tracking is under 1 5 m and there is ambient light the approach used to detect the ds changes and the algorithm tries to estimate the relative position of it using the ar markers instead of the light beacons when the system was on tracking mode it was able to provide updates at a maximum of 15 h z which corresponds to the capture frame rate of the camera because acoustic ranges light beacons and ar marker measurements are equally used to update the ds position in the ekf slam filter the position of these three elements with respect to the ds frame must be properly calibrated fig 24 compares the distance between the auv and the ds estimated according to the acoustic ranges light beacons and ar markers all methods show a high degree of agreement with the trajectory estimated offline once the ds position was known precisely with differences smaller than 30 cm the background colors in the plot represent the number of light beacons inside the fov of the camera this is depending on the orientation of the auv a different number of light beacons are inside the fov of the camera due to the fact that the orientation of the ds is known a priori even when only two of the light beacons have been identified it is possible to estimate the relative pose for this particular mission the optical track was lost between seconds 15 to 25 due to a reorientation of the auv to correctly approach the ds from second 45 onwards when the distance is smaller than 1 5 m the optical tracking was based on ar markers from the plot we can conclude that the optical tracking worked when the lights were in the camera fov and in a distance of less than 7 m the tracking was lost at 1 5 m moment in which the tracking method changed to ar markers detection the uncertainty of the ds position according to the visual estimates is shown in fig 25 the plot includes the uncertainty in the detection of the ds in the image but excludes the uncertainty in the transformation between the camera and the auv and the uncertainty related with the camera calibration peaks in the uncertainty plot appear when only two or three lights are visible instead of four fig 26 shows the bathymetric data collected along several survey missions that were autonomously commanded and executed in different locations although the data might not be very valuable in terms of mapping utility because the area was extremely flat and with scarcity of features it serves as a proof of concept and testifies to the whole concept of the loon dock being able to remotely command and retrieve large amounts of data from a persistently deployed auv through a ds 6 conclusions and future work this paper has presented the docking solution implemented in the context of the loon dock project in order to demonstrate the remote operation and data transmission of a survey auv from internet we have designed and built a docking station for sparus ii auv providing passive and active guidance mechanisms a latching system high bandwidth data communications and visual feedback the active guidance for docking is based on two complementary and cost effective systems two acoustic modems using only range information within a sog filter to detect the ds from mid distances and a vision based system composed of a set of light beacons and visual markers used in the terminal homing phase the combination of a mid accuracy mid range method with a high accuracy short range method allows us to reliably dock the auv the system has been extensively tested with trials ranging from a controlled water tank environment to more realistic sea operation conditions successful validation of all the involved parts i e auv navigation control acoustic communications and autonomous docking capabilities has been conducted despite the presence of currents and very poor water visibility the main downside identified in our docking approach arises in the presence of strong water currents that are not aligned with the docking station sparus ii being a torpedo shaped vehicle underactuated in sway can only deal with lateral currents by changing its heading this has two negative effects first by adapting the heading to compensate the currents the vehicle is more prone to lose sight of the light beacons during the terminal homing and second if the misalignment with the docking is larger than 30 the vehicle cannot physically enter inside the funnel receptacle for this reason as a future work it is important to deal with the automatic alignment of the ds with the currents notice that the proposed design is already able to rotate the ds funnel receptacle and only a system to measure the water currents and an actuator to move it accordingly would have to be added besides a battery recharging mechanism will be also integrated in the future to complete the system and enable its persistent deployment through longer time spans acknowledgement this work was supported by the eu funded project loon dock sunrise sensing monitoring and actuating in the underwater world through a federated research infrastructure extending the future internet fp7 ict 2013 10 611449
