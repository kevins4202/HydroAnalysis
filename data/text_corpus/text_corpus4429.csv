frequently observed with the cavity covering part of the vehicle body and the exposing part under transient hydrodynamic load korpriva et al kopriva et al 2005 experimentally investigated the

researches much efforts have been done for the global flow structures and corresponding hydrodynamic characteristics of the ventilated partial cavitation under different flow conditions to better

diameter is d 0 02m fig 3 based on the diameter of the axisymmetric body 0 02m and the angle of attack 0 is about 9 so the blockage effect has been ignored in the present work further investigation of the blockage effect on the cavitating flow and corresponding hydrodynamic characteristics will be conducted in future work the ventilation pipe is two fifths of the axisymmetric body in diameter and the ventilated flow speed and pressure are controlled by a control valve to avoid the non uniform of the ventilated gas flow due to the gravity effect two rows of air injection holes are distributed

and smear out the flow structures within a given grid resolution range to offer a more satisfactory resolution the effective viscosity be reduced by imposing a filter on the turbulence model as set values of the filter size are smaller than the length scales returned by the conventional rans model the turbulent scales smaller than the filter size could not be resolved in the paper the filter

4atm and the ventilated flow rate q in ranges from 0 to 800l h thus the froude number and the air entrainment coefficient are defined as 13 f r u g d 1 2 14 c q q in u d 2 where u is the average velocity q in is the volume flow of gas and d is the diameter of the body the ventilated cavitating flow is simulated on the computing platform of the cfx solver the computational domain and boundary conditions are given according to the experimental setup a no slip boundary condition is imposed on the test body surface and boundaries of the tunnel a constant turbulent intensity of 2 set at the inlet boundary which is consistent to the measured value in the experiment the inlet boundary of the domain is set as the opening boundary both for the liquid and gas phases with the inlet velocity of the gas injection set as the bulk mass flow rate the ventilated cavitation simulations have been initialized with the steady state fully wetted solutions with density of the liquid water at 25 c is ρ

the value of y at the wall is smaller than 45 three meshes which give a constant refinement ratio r n fine n course 1 414 are used in the grid convergence study where n is the grid nodes number as shown in table 1 the relative error is estimated based on richardson extrapolation ji et al 2017 long et al 2019 as the relative errors are less than 1 the results for mesh iii are considered as mesh independent so the subsequent simulations are performed with the meshing scheme of mesh iii the time integration scheme is a second order backward euler algorithm and the spatial derivatives are computed using a second order upwind scheme the time step chosen for the simulation is δt 5 10 4s based on convergence studies 4 results and discussion 4 1 global multiphase structures in ventilated partial cavitating flows figs 5 and 6 shows the evolution of cavity length and corresponding typical ventilated partial cavitating flow patterns also the pressure contours on the test body are shown in the simulations the isosurface of 10 gas volume fraction is used to illustrate the cavity boundary good agreement can be obtained between the experimental and numerical results to better illustrate the comparison between the test and computational results the mean square errors between the experimental and numerical results has been calculated which is 0 08 according to the flow patterns the ventilated cavity around the axisymmetric body experiences three stages rapid growth growth with small pulsation and periodic shedding during the first stage the ventilated gas flow upstream and downstream from the ventilated hole and a ring shape cavity is formed around the axisymmetric body with the cavity length increasing dramatically as shown in fig 5 and fig 6 a b meanwhile the re entrant jet generates due to the pressure gradient at the rear part of the attached cavity and moves towards the shoulder of the axisymmetric body resulting that the forepart of the attached cavity appears transparent and the rear part in a fuzzy shape as shown in fig 6 b as the re entrant jet encounters the main flow part of the attached cavity breaks off due to the interaction of the two opposite flows as shown in fig 6 c affected by the continuous ventilated gas flow the concave deformation occurs on the gas liquid interface of the cracked cavity and three dimensional effect of the ventilated cavity can be obviously observed around the axisymmetric body as shown in fig 6 d after that the cavity development transits from the rapid growth to growth with small pulsation during this stage as shown in fig 5 the growth rate of the maximum cavity length declines with small pulsation this is because the attached cavity develops accompanied with the continuous shedding of the small scale detached cavities at the rear part of the attached cavity as shown in fig 6 e and f until t t 0 108 5 ms the attached cavity develops to the maximum following by a significant fluctuation of the cavity length during this stage large scale detached cavity sheds quasi periodically as shown in fig 6 g it should be noted that the cavity shapes are extremely dissymmetrical along the circumference of the axisymmetric body in other words three dimensional characteristics are extremely impressive in the unsteady cavitating flows around an axisymmetric body this is also mentioned by lindau lindau et al 2002 and hu hu et al 2015 further investigation of the three dimensional effect on the ventilated cavitating flows and corresponding hydrodynamic characteristics will be conducted in future work fig 7 shows the evolution of the predicted pressure coefficient around the axisymmetric body at different sections for the section at x d 0 5 and x d 1 the evolution of pressure coefficients is markedly different from that at the other sections which is affected by the high speed gas flow from the ventilated hole as for the section from x d 1 5 to x d 4 a pressure peak appears successively when the attached cavity gradually reached each section position and then drop dramatically to the saturated vapor pressure as the attached cavity covers the position as for the pressure fluctuation occurred after the attached cavity covering the position such as the section at x d 1 5 x d 2 and x d 2 5 this is due to the shedding of the small scale detached cavities at the rear part of the attached cavity while for the pressure fluctuation before the pressure peaks such as the section at x d 3 5 and x d 4 this is because of the disturbance caused by the upstream detached shedding cavities when it develops to the third stage high amplitude and low frequency variation of the pressure coefficients can be obviously observed which is corresponding to the periodical shedding of the large scale detached cavities to further investigate the relationship between re entrant jet and cavity shedding fig 8 shows the evolution of the velocity distribution inside the ventilated cavity where the solid red line indicates the cavity boundary it can be seen from fig 8 a that the re entrant jet mainly moves upstream along the wall of the axisymmetric body when meets with the ventilation gas flow it is pushed far away from the axisymmetric body resulting to the rising of the cavity diameter and the discontinuity of the cavity boundary curvature the rolled up re entrant jet flow downstream with the main flow meanwhile the concave cavity occurs at the position where the cavity boundary curvature changes significantly as shown in fig 8 b with the attached cavity develops the concave position moves downstream and even deeper as shown in fig 8 c until the concave cavity boundary reaches to the re entrant jet near the wall the latter part of the attached cavity with a rising cavity diameter breaks off with the attached cavity and large scale detached cavity is formed and shed downstream as shown in fig 8 d 4 2 the influence of angle of attack on the ventilated partial cavitating flows to further investigate the effect of the asymmetry on the unsteady shedding behaviors of ventilated partial cavitating flow fig 9 shows the typical ventilated cavitating flow patterns at different angles of attack α in which the froude number fr 15 66 and the gas entrainment coefficient c q 0 06 reasonable agreement can be obtained between the experimental and numerical results with the mean square error between the measured and predicted cavity pattern is 0 18 0 12 and 0 07 for the axisymmetric body with α 0 5 and 8 respectively as shown in fig 9 a at α 0 symmetrical attached cavity is formed and develops around the axisymmetric body which is filled with the gas liquid mixture and appears non transparent with the increase of the angle of attack the attached cavity develops asymmetrically with the attached cavity length on the opposing stream surface is longer than that on the confronted stream surface moreover the non transparent gas liquid mixture region is gradually concentrated on the opposing stream surface and the attached cavity on the confronted stream surface appears transparent as shown in fig 9 b when the angle of attack is further increased to 8 the cavity asymmetry is more obvious and the transparent cavity region increases with the non transparent gas liquid mixture only existed at the end of the attached cavity as shown in fig 9 c in order to further investigate the influence of the angle of attack on the ventilated cavity patterns and flow structures fig 10 shows the water volume fraction at different cross sections of the axisymmetric body with different angles of attack when the main attached cavity keeps steady the cavity boundary is illustrated with the isosurface of 10 gas volume fraction it can be seen that when α 0 the gas volume fraction at different cross sections distribute uniformly in the circumferential direction with the attached cavity diameter increasing along the flow direction until x d 2 5 then fluctuating slightly between x d 2 5 and x d 3 5 and finally decreasing until the end of the attached cavity when the angle of attack increases to α 5 the gas volume fraction at the cross section x d 0 5 which is near the shoulder of the axisymmetric body remains uniform in the circumferential direction as shown in fig 10 b while the gas volume fraction at the latter cross sections is accumulated upwards and finally exhibits as the crescent shape as the angle of attack further increases to α 8 the axial position of the cross section with a crescent shape distribution of the gas volume fraction is much closer to the head of the axisymmetric body indicating that the greater the angle of attack the more asymmetrical cavity is obtained what s more assuming that the pressure gradient has no component along the attached cavity closure line the re entrant jet velocity is directed in the opposite direction of the incident flow as the angle of attack α 0 while as the angle of attack increases the cavity closure line is inclined and with the increase of the angle of attack the angle of inclination for the attached cavity closure line decreases according to the conservation of the tangential momentum the re entrant jet velocity has two components that are perpendicular and along the closure line this is also mentioned by de lange de lange et al 1994 and franc 2001 to further investigate the effect of the angles of attack on the ventilated partial cavitation fig 11 shows the predicted pressure distribution at both confronted and opposing stream surface of the axisymmetric body with different angles of attack as the angle of attack increases the high pressure region corresponding to the attached cavity closure at the confronted stream surface moves upstream and that at the opposing stream surface remains almost steady this is because the angle of attack mainly affect the attached cavity length at the confronted stream surface of axisymmetric body and has little effect on the attached cavity length at the opposing stream surface as the relative thickness of the attached cavity and the re entrant jet is an important factor for the detached cavity shedding in order to reveal the cavity shedding mechanism of the axisymmetric body at different angles of attack fig 12 shows the attached cavity and re entrant jet boundary on the cross section at x d 2 with different angles of attack when the angle of attack α 0 the attached cavity is much thicker than the re entrant jet layer and the interaction between the re entrant jet and the ventilated gas flow is weak so that the re entrant jet can reach to the head of the attached cavity resulting to the partial shedding of the ventilated cavity with the increases of the angle of attack of the axisymmetric body the maximum thickness of the re entrant jet is close to the attached cavity boundary and there is a strong interaction between the re entrant jet and ventilation gas flow resulting that the re entrant jet mainly exists in the rear region of the cavity which is corresponding to the small scale detached cavity shedding at the end of the attached cavity 5 conclusions experimental and numerical studies have been conducted for an axisymmetric body to investigate the unsteady shedding behaviors of ventilated partial cavitating flow high speed visualization technique has been adopted to present the global multiphase structures and numerical simulation has been combined to further investigate the cavity shedding mechanism the primary findings include 1 the ventilated cavity around the axisymmetric body experiences three stages rapid growth growth with small pulsation and periodic shedding during the rapid growth stage the ventilated gas flow upstream and downstream from the ventilated hole and a ring shape cavity is formed around the axisymmetric body along with the interaction between the main attached cavity and the re entrant jet during the growth with small pulsation stage the attached cavity develops accompanied with the continuous shedding of the small scale detached cavities at the rear part of the attached cavity resulting that the growth rate of the maximum cavity length declines with small pulsation during the periodic shedding stage large scale detached cavity sheds quasi periodically accompanied with a significant fluctuation of the attached cavity length 2 the re entrant jet has a significant role on the unsteady cavity shedding behaviors the re entrant jet generated due to the pressure gradient and moves upstream along the wall of the axisymmetric body when meets with the ventilation gas flow the re entrant jet is pushed far away from the axisymmetric body resulting to the rising of the attached cavity diameter and the discontinuity of the cavity boundary curvature which leads to the attached cavity depressed inward until the concave cavity boundary reaches to the re entrant jet near the wall the latter part of the attached cavity with a rising cavity diameter breaks off with the attached cavity and large scale detached cavity is formed and shed downstream 3 the angle of attack influence the ventilated partial cavitating flow patterns symmetrical cavity is formed and develops around the axisymmetric body with the angle of attack α 0 the attached cavity develops asymmetrically with the angle of attack α 5 and 8 the non transparent gas liquid mixture region is gradually concentrated on the opposing stream surface and the transparent cavity region increases on the confronted stream surface author

conditions are given according to the experimental setup a no slip boundary condition is imposed on the test body surface and boundaries of the tunnel a constant turbulent intensity of 2 set at the inlet boundary which is consistent to the measured value in the experiment the inlet boundary of the domain is set as the opening boundary both for the liquid and gas phases with the inlet velocity of the gas injection set as the bulk mass flow rate the ventilated cavitation simulations have been initialized with the steady state fully wetted solutions with density of the liquid water at 25 c is ρ l 998 kg m3 viscosity μ l ρ l ν l 1 139 10 3 pa s and density of the air air at 25 c is ρ g 1 185 kg m3 viscosity μ g 18 31 10 6 pa s the 3d mesh as shown in fig 4 is composed of 1300000 elements and the value of y at the wall is smaller than 45 three meshes which give a constant refinement ratio r n fine n course 1 414 are used in the grid convergence study where n is the grid nodes number as shown in table 1 the relative error is estimated based on richardson extrapolation ji et al 2017 long et al 2019 as the relative errors are less than 1 the results for mesh iii are considered as mesh independent so the subsequent simulations are performed with the meshing scheme of mesh iii the time integration scheme is a second order backward euler algorithm and the spatial derivatives are computed using a second order upwind scheme the time step chosen for the simulation is δt 5 10 4s based on convergence studies 4 results and discussion 4 1 global multiphase structures in ventilated partial cavitating flows figs 5 and 6 shows the evolution of cavity length and corresponding typical ventilated partial cavitating flow patterns also the pressure contours on the test body are shown in the simulations the isosurface of 10 gas volume fraction is used to illustrate the cavity boundary good agreement can be obtained between the experimental and numerical results to better illustrate the comparison between the test and computational results the mean square errors between the experimental and numerical results has been calculated which is 0 08 according to the flow patterns the ventilated cavity around the axisymmetric body experiences three stages rapid growth growth with small pulsation and periodic shedding during the first stage the ventilated gas flow upstream and downstream from the ventilated hole and a ring shape cavity is formed around the axisymmetric body with the cavity length increasing dramatically as shown in fig 5 and fig 6 a b meanwhile the re entrant jet generates due to the pressure gradient at the rear part of the attached cavity and moves towards the shoulder of the axisymmetric body resulting that the forepart of the attached cavity appears transparent and the rear part in a fuzzy shape as shown in fig 6 b as the re entrant jet encounters the main flow part of the attached cavity breaks off due to the interaction of the two opposite flows as shown in fig 6 c affected by the continuous ventilated gas flow the concave deformation occurs on the gas liquid interface of the cracked cavity and three dimensional effect of the ventilated cavity can be obviously observed around the axisymmetric body as shown in fig 6 d after that the cavity development transits from the rapid growth to growth with small pulsation during this stage as shown in fig 5 the growth rate of the maximum cavity length declines with small pulsation this is because the attached cavity develops accompanied with the continuous shedding of the small scale detached cavities at the rear part of the attached cavity as shown in fig 6 e and f until t t 0 108 5 ms the attached cavity develops to the maximum following by a significant fluctuation of the cavity length during this stage large scale detached cavity sheds quasi periodically as shown in fig 6 g it should be noted that the cavity shapes are extremely dissymmetrical along the circumference of the axisymmetric body in other words three dimensional characteristics are extremely impressive in the unsteady cavitating flows around an axisymmetric body this is also mentioned by lindau lindau et al 2002 and hu hu et al 2015 further investigation of the three dimensional effect on the ventilated cavitating flows and corresponding hydrodynamic characteristics will be conducted in future work fig 7 shows the evolution of the predicted pressure coefficient around the axisymmetric body at different sections for the section at x d 0 5 and x d 1 the evolution of pressure coefficients is markedly different from that at the other sections which is affected by the high speed gas flow from the ventilated hole as for the section from x d 1 5 to x d 4 a pressure peak appears successively when the attached cavity gradually reached each section position and then drop dramatically to the saturated vapor pressure as the attached cavity covers the position as for the pressure fluctuation occurred after the attached cavity covering the position such as the section at x d 1 5 x d 2 and x d 2 5 this is due to the shedding of the small scale detached cavities at the rear part of the attached cavity while for the pressure fluctuation before the pressure peaks such as the section at x d 3 5 and x d 4 this is because of the disturbance caused by the upstream detached shedding cavities when it develops to the third stage high amplitude and low frequency variation of the pressure coefficients can be obviously observed which is corresponding to the periodical shedding of the large scale detached cavities to further investigate the relationship between re entrant jet and cavity shedding fig 8 shows the evolution of the velocity distribution inside the ventilated cavity where the solid red line indicates the cavity boundary it can be seen from fig 8 a that the re entrant jet mainly moves upstream along the wall of the axisymmetric body when meets with the ventilation gas flow it is pushed far away from the axisymmetric body resulting to the rising of the cavity diameter and the discontinuity of the cavity boundary curvature the rolled up re entrant jet flow downstream with the main flow meanwhile the concave cavity occurs at the position where the cavity boundary curvature changes significantly as shown in fig 8 b with the attached cavity develops the concave position moves downstream and even deeper as shown in fig 8 c until the concave cavity boundary reaches to the re entrant jet near the wall the latter part of the attached cavity with a rising cavity diameter breaks off with the attached cavity and large scale detached cavity is formed and shed downstream as shown in fig 8 d 4 2 the influence of angle of attack on the ventilated partial cavitating flows to further investigate the effect of the asymmetry on the unsteady shedding behaviors of ventilated partial cavitating flow fig 9 shows the typical ventilated cavitating flow patterns at different angles of attack α in which the froude number fr 15 66 and the gas entrainment coefficient c q 0 06 reasonable agreement can be obtained between the experimental and numerical results with the mean square error between the measured and predicted cavity pattern is 0 18 0 12 and 0 07 for the axisymmetric body with α 0 5 and 8 respectively as shown in fig 9 a at α 0 symmetrical attached cavity is formed and develops around the axisymmetric body which is filled with the gas liquid mixture and appears non transparent with the increase of the angle of attack the attached cavity develops asymmetrically with the attached cavity length on the opposing stream surface is longer than that on the confronted stream surface moreover the non transparent gas liquid mixture region is gradually concentrated on the opposing stream surface and the attached cavity on the confronted stream surface appears transparent as shown in fig 9 b when the angle of attack is further increased to 8 the cavity asymmetry is more obvious and the transparent cavity region increases with the non transparent gas liquid mixture only existed at the end of the attached cavity as shown in fig 9 c in order to further investigate the influence of the angle of attack on the ventilated cavity patterns and flow structures fig 10 shows the water volume fraction at different cross sections of the axisymmetric body with different angles of attack when the main attached cavity keeps steady the cavity boundary is illustrated with the isosurface of 10 gas volume fraction it can be seen that when α 0 the gas volume fraction at different cross sections distribute uniformly in the circumferential direction with the attached cavity diameter increasing along the flow direction until x d 2 5 then fluctuating slightly between x d 2 5 and x d 3 5 and finally decreasing until the end of the attached cavity when the angle of attack increases to α 5 the gas volume fraction at the cross section x d 0 5 which is near the shoulder of the axisymmetric body remains uniform in the circumferential direction as shown in fig 10 b while the gas volume fraction at the latter cross sections is accumulated upwards and finally exhibits as the crescent shape as the angle of attack further increases to α 8 the axial position of the cross section with a crescent shape distribution of the gas volume fraction is much closer to the head of the axisymmetric body indicating that the greater the angle of attack the more asymmetrical cavity is obtained what s more assuming that the pressure gradient has no component along the attached cavity closure line the re entrant jet velocity is directed in the opposite direction of the incident flow as the angle of attack α 0 while as the angle of attack increases the cavity closure line is inclined and with the increase of the angle of attack the angle of inclination for the attached cavity closure line decreases according to the conservation of the tangential momentum the re entrant jet velocity has two components that are perpendicular and along the closure line this is also mentioned by de lange de lange et al 1994 and franc 2001 to further investigate the effect of the angles of attack on the ventilated partial cavitation fig 11 shows the predicted pressure distribution at both confronted and opposing stream surface of the axisymmetric body with different angles of attack as the angle of attack increases the high pressure region corresponding to the attached cavity closure at the confronted stream surface moves upstream and that at the opposing stream surface remains almost steady this is because the angle of attack mainly affect the attached cavity length at the confronted stream surface of axisymmetric body and has little effect on the attached cavity length at the opposing stream surface as the relative thickness of the attached cavity and the re entrant jet is an important factor for the detached cavity shedding in order to reveal the cavity shedding mechanism of the axisymmetric body at different angles of attack fig 12 shows the attached cavity and re entrant jet boundary on the cross section at x d 2 with different angles of attack when the angle of attack α 0 the attached cavity is much thicker than the re entrant jet layer and the interaction between the re entrant jet and the ventilated gas flow is weak so that the re entrant jet can reach to the head of the attached cavity resulting to the partial shedding of the ventilated cavity with the increases of the angle of attack of the axisymmetric body the maximum thickness of the re entrant jet is close to the attached cavity boundary and there is a strong interaction between the re entrant jet and ventilation gas flow resulting that the re entrant jet mainly exists in the rear region of the cavity which is corresponding to the small scale detached cavity shedding at the end of the attached cavity 5 conclusions experimental and numerical studies have been conducted for an axisymmetric body to investigate the unsteady shedding behaviors of ventilated partial cavitating flow high speed visualization technique has been adopted to present the global multiphase structures and numerical simulation has been combined to further investigate the cavity shedding mechanism the primary findings include 1 the ventilated cavity around the axisymmetric body experiences three stages rapid growth growth with small pulsation and periodic shedding during the rapid growth stage the ventilated gas flow upstream and downstream from the ventilated hole and a ring shape cavity is formed around the axisymmetric body along with the interaction between the main attached cavity and the re entrant jet during the growth with small pulsation stage the attached cavity develops accompanied with the continuous shedding of the small scale detached cavities at the rear part of the attached cavity resulting that the growth rate of the maximum cavity length declines with small pulsation during the periodic shedding stage large scale detached cavity sheds quasi periodically accompanied with a significant fluctuation of the attached cavity length 2 the re entrant jet has a significant role on the unsteady cavity shedding behaviors the re entrant jet generated due to the pressure gradient and moves upstream along the wall of the axisymmetric body when meets with the ventilation gas flow the re entrant jet is pushed far away from the axisymmetric body resulting to the rising of the attached cavity diameter and the discontinuity of the cavity boundary curvature which leads to the attached cavity depressed inward until the concave cavity boundary reaches to the re entrant jet near the wall the latter part of the attached cavity with a rising cavity diameter breaks off with the attached cavity and large scale detached cavity is formed and shed downstream 3 the angle of attack influence the ventilated partial cavitating flow patterns symmetrical cavity is formed and develops around the axisymmetric body with the angle of attack α 0 the attached cavity develops asymmetrically with the angle of attack α 5 and 8 the non transparent gas liquid mixture region is gradually concentrated on the opposing stream surface and the transparent cavity region increases on the confronted stream surface author

properties including seabed porosity permeability coefficient and shear modulus on seismic response of breakwater and the momentary liquefaction of seabed keywords breakwater seawater seabed bedrock system accurate absorbing boundary fluid poroelastic solid media seismic response momentary liquefaction 1 introduction breakwaters are one kind of hydraulic structures to protect from siltation of the alluvial soil and wave erosion to the coastline and to protect humans living near the coastline however relevant reports of the failure of breakwaters are not uncommon during strong earthquakes in the past two decades iai and kameoka 1993 sumer et al 2002 yüksel et al 2006 once the breakwaters are destroyed by earthquakes the damage will be unimaginable therefore it is of great significance to do in depth research on the seismic performance dynamic characteristics and failure mechanism of breakwaters during earthquakes generally there are two main kinds of environmental loadings for offshore structures one is the hydrodynamic loading induced by ocean waves and current the other is the earthquake loading ye and jeng 2013 dynamic responses and stability of marine structure under wave and current loadings have been numerically investigated by many researchers sarpkaya 2004 sumer 2009 young et al 2009 jeng 2003 to analyze the dynamic response of marine structure or seabed under hydrodynamic loading wave and current induced pressure derived from linear or nonlinear wave theory is simply applied to surface of seabed or structure in the research liu et al 2014 he 2017 wen and wang 2015 due to above techniques belong to non coupled ones the dynamic interactions among water seabed and marine structures have not been considered in recent years great progress has been achieved in numerical research li et al 2018 liao et al 2018a b tong et al 2017 on the dynamic response of marine structures under hydrodynamic loading in which one way coupling method with consideration of water structure interaction and seabed structure interaction is applied in models however the seabed water interaction is neglected in those models research on dynamic response of offshore structures and liquefaction of surrounding seabed induced by earthquake is relatively limited in the literature physic experiment kiara et al 2001 memos et al 2000 liu and zhu 2001 cihan and yuksel 2011 cihan et al 2012 were developed to evaluate the dynamic characters and stability of the breakwater under earthquake they found that breakwater will failure under strong earthquakes although the physic experiment is a fundamental method its high cost time consumption and distortion caused by scaled model are still inevitable barriers in studying the seismic response of breakwater numerical method as an alternative tool has become a more popular approach to investigating seismic response of the breakwater because of its low cost and good repeatability among there yang et al 2014 2016 established a finite element coupled model to analyze the seismic response of breakwater water foundation system with fluid structure interaction jafarian et al 2010 evaluated the earthquake induced permanent displacement of breakwater on a liquefiable layer in which accumulated excess pore water pressure model was embedded in the software flac to model pore pressure response due to lacking of poroelastic model for simulating sediment in above research yang et al 2014 2016 jafarian et al 2010 the influence of sediment on dynamic response of breakwater was ignored ye and jeng assessed the seismic response of a poroelastic unsaturated seabed and a rubble mound breakwater by two dimension 2d and three dimension 3d finite element model ye 2012 ye and jeng 2013 where the fixed boundary was applied on the left and right lateral sides of the seabed in their models a relatively large finite element zone was required to eliminate effect of the lateral boundary condition on the dynamic response in the region of interest besides both water structure interaction and seabed water interaction were ignored in their models chen and huang chen 2000 chen and huang 2002 developed a coupled model to estimate the seismic response of breakwater seawater seabed system in which the underneath bedrock haven t been incorporated into the numerical model in fact surrounding media of breakwater in ocean environment consist of water seabed and underlying bedrock however to the authors best knowledge the accurate model that can rigourously consider interaction between breakwater water seabed and underlying bedrock has not been available in the literature during solving seismic response of the breakwater the objective of this study is to develop a new robust frequency domain finite element model for seismic response of breakwater seawater seabed bedrock system with full consideration of interactions among them the rest part of this paper is organised as follows the seismic response problem of the breakwater seawater seabed bedrock system is stated in section 2 in section 3 an accurate absorbing boundary condition abc for far field of infinite domain is proposed in the frequency domain combination of the proposed abc equivalent input seismic loads and near field finite element equation the coupled model to evaluate the seismic response of breakwater water seabed bedrock system is obtained in section 4 numerical examples are given in section 5 to demonstrate the effectiveness of the coupled model the above coupled model is applied to investigate the effects of slope angle of breakwater water depth and seabed soil properties here including porosity permeability coefficient and shear modulus on seismic responses of the breakwater and the momentary liquefaction of seabed in the region near to the breakwater in section 6 conclusions follow in section 7 2 problem statement a typical 2d configuration of breakwater water seabed bedrock system under seismic motion is shown in fig 1 where the cartesian coordinate system x y is adopted in the model the origin of the cartesian coordinate system is located inside breakwater for numerical evaluation to the seismic response of breakwater seawater seabed bedrock system using finite element method fem two straight line shaped artificial boundaries are introduced to divide the whole domain into finite domain d left infinite domain ω l and right infinite domain ω r as shown in fig 1 the finite domain d that contains the breakwater can be numerically simulated by only fem the domain of breakwater is modeled as fluid saturated poroelastic medium with the relevant larger stiffness coefficients the breakwater and seabed foundation are tied together at the foundation breakwater interface where the contact nonlinearity is not considered assumed the surface of breakwater emerged from seawater is permeable and free the left or right infinite domain on both sides of the breakwater structure consist of water of depth d 1 seabed of total thickness d 2 and bedrock of total thickness d 3 they can be represented as the horizontally layered fluid poroelastic solid media with the surface interfacial and bottom physical boundaries denoted as γ s γ sp γ ps and γ r respectively the poroelastic medium for the breakwater and seabed is a kind of two phase medium whose governing equation has been developed by the biot s theory biot 1956a b biot 2004 and its equivalent form zienkiewicz 1982 zienkiewicz et al 1980 zienkiewicz and shiomi 1984 after truncating the infinite domain by introducing artificial boundaries abcs and the equivalent loads should be imposed on γ bl and γ br of the finite domain d to efficiently and accurately complete the finite element evaluation to breakwater seawater seabed bedrock system in the paper the left and right abcs will be mathematically derived from the following problem defined in ω l and ω r respectively the equivalent loads will also be obtained by combining 1d site response and the proposed abcs 2 1 wave equations 2 1 1 fluid medium for water the water is assumed to be an ideal compressible fluid medium whose governing equations are shown as

discretize the wave equation along y direction in the next section 7 l x l 1 y l 2 with l 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 t l 2 0 0 1 0 1 0 t taking the first order partial derivative with respect to time t of both sides of equation 6 a and substituting equation 7 into equation 6 b obtains the equivalent wave equations as 8 a q 2 k 2 ρ f 2 g 2 p 2 x 2 2 p 2 y 2 α 2 u x 2 x α 2 u y 2 y p 2 8 b a 11 2 2 u 2 x 2 a

generally considered as a horizontally layered solid medium the governing equations are shown as follows the constitutive equation is 9 σ 3 d 3 l u 3 with d 3 λ 3 2 g 3 λ 3 0 λ 3 λ 3 2 g 3 0 0 0 g 3 where σ 3 σ x 3 σ y 3 τ x y 3 t and u 3 u x 3 u y 3 t are the stress and displacement vectors respectively and λ 3 and g 3 are the lame constants the differential operator l is the same as that in above subsection the dynamic equilibrium equation is 10 l t σ 3 ρ 3 u 3 where ρ 3 is the density substituting equation 9 into equation 10 the wave equation of the displacement can be written as follows 11 l t d 3 l u 3 ρ 3 u 3 in the same way as presented in equation 8 the equivalent wave equation can be obtained as follows by substituting equation 7 into equation 11 12 a 11 3 2 u 3 x 2 a 12

linearized free surface condition 13 a p 1 ρ 1 g u y 1 for static water condition 13 b p 1 0 2 2 2 interface condition between fluid and poroelastic media the normal displacement continuity condition between the fluid medium and the fluid phase of poroelastic medium is satisfied at the interface the pressure of the fluid medium is in equilibrium with the pore pressure and the normal total stress of the poroelastic medium respectively the tangential total stress is assumed to be zero these requirements at the interface γ sp y y 1 d 1 can be written as listed in equation 14 14 a w n 2 u n 2 u n

al 2011 to make the problem determinate equation 14 a is added herein 2 2 3 interface condition between poroelastic and solid media the displacement continuity condition between the solid skeleton of poroelastic medium and the underneath solid medium should be satisfied at the interface it is assumed that the solid medium is impermeable which leads to the normal displacement of the pore fluid relative to the solid skeleton being zero besides the stress is also in equilibrium between the two media these conditions at the interface γ ps y y 2 d 1 d 2 are written as listed in equation 15 15 a u 2 u 3 15 b w n 2 0 15 c σ n 2 σ n 3 15 d s n 2 s n 3 with reference to yang 2001 these conditions are basically the same as those at the interface between the poroelastic medium and the solid medium

standard finite element assembly the other coefficient matrices can be assembled from those given in subsections 3 1 to 3 3 as follows image 1 where the symbol x represents the sum of the matrix elements at the interface between two kinds of media it should be noted that the matrix m a derives from linearized free surface condition as presented in subsection 2 2 1 similarly both matrixes v a and h a are adopted to match fluid and seabed layer in the same way as presented in equation 27 general nodal force vector along whole γ br can be obtained by assembling equations 18 22 23 and 26 by applying the interface conditions equations 14b and 15a the relationship between the general nodal force vector y b r and correspondingly general nodal displacement vector x b r p u x u y t along

general force and general displacement on the artificial boundary is obtained in this section the general nodal displacement vector along whole γ br satisfies following transformation 29 x b r x t x b r x ω e i ω t x b r k ω e i ω t k x where i is the imaginary unit k is the wavenumber in x direction ω is the circular frequency the x b r is the values of x b r in the frequency domain and x b r is the values of x b r in the frequency wavenumber domain the general force vector in equation 28 can be written in the same form as equation 29 by using equation 29 equation 27 can be transformed from the time space domain into following frequency wavenumber domain 30 k 2 b p i ω g p 0 0 0 b x x b x y 0 b y x b y y i k 0 ω 2 t x 0 s x e 1 x x e 2 x x e 1 x x e 2 x y s y e 1 y x e 2 y x e 1 y y e 2

after specifying the bottom boundary condition of bedrock equation 30 forms the eigenvalue problem on the wavenumber k in frequency wavenumber domain the eigenvalue problem can be solved by the method applied in the paper waas 1972 the frequency domain general nodal displacement solution along whole artificial boundary is a linear combination of the eigenvector from equation 30 it can be written as follows 31 x b r φ e x q where e x is the diagonal matrix of the diagonal entries e i k i x r where the k i is all the eigenvalues of equation 30 satisfying the radiation condition and x r is the x coordinate at right side of finite domain φ is the eigenvector matrix containing all the corresponding column eigenvectors and q is the undetermined coefficient column vector after transformation of equation 28 into the frequency domain the general nodal force vector of finite domain along whole γ br can be obtained as follows 32 y b r b x b r x e x b r with b b 1 i ω b 2 substituting equation 31 into equation 32 and then combining the result with equation 33 to eliminate the undermined coefficient q the dynamic stiffness relation along γ br can be obtained as follows 33 y b r s b r x b r with the dynamic stiffness matrix s b r i b φ κ φ 1 e where k is the diagonal matrix with the diagonal entries as all eigenvalues k i of equation 30 satisfying the radiation condition it should be noticed that the radiation condition is different between left artificial boundary and right those waas 1972 equation 33 is the frequency domain abc along whole γ br in the same way as presented in equation 33 the dynamic stiffness matrix s b l along whole γ bl can be also obtained as follows 34 y b l s b l x b l it should be noted that there are three obvious advantages of the proposed frequency domain abc compared to the existing those in time domain first after coupling with frequency domain finite element it can be used to estimate the amplification characteristic of the dynamic response of structures or topography that is independent of the input condition second instability phenomena will not be a concern during solving the accurate artificial boundary in this method however the frequency domain method can only be used to solve the linear elasticity or equivalent linearization problem in addition the time domain method is applicable to both linear and nonlinear problems but application of high precision artificial boundary conditions in the time domain may encounter the instability phenomenon third the proposed frequency domain method in this paper can easily account for hysteretic damping of the soils and the structures by the correspondence principle and the coupling procedure in this paper does not adopt any approximation 4 finite element coupled equation of breakwater water seabed bedrock system by combination the proposed abc and one dimension site response the accurate method applied to assess the seismic response of breakwater water seabed bedrock system is presented in this section in detail 4 1 finite element equation in the time domain the finite domain also can be discretized by the standard finite element technology in 2d space after the spatial discretization to above three kinds of media on the basis of full consideration about the interface conditions 13 16 the finite element equation can be obtained as follows 35 m r r m r b l m r

boundary right artificial boundary and the finite domain d respectively m c and k are the mass damping and stiffness matrices respectively and the definitions of x and y are the same as that in section 3 y r a denotes the loading acting on finite domain y b l a and y b r a are the force of infinite domain truncated by the artificial boundary on finite domain under the action of external loadings such as earthquakes 4 2 coupled equation equation 35 can be transformed into the frequency domain by fourier transformation it can be written as follows 36 ω 2 m r r i ω c r r k r r ω 2 m r b

r a x b l a x b r a y r a y b l a y b r a the total response at the artificial boundary can be decomposed into the scattering field response and the free field response based on the idea proposed in paper liu et al 2019 the total general nodal displacement and force vectors at the artificial boundary can be written as follows the total general nodal displacement vectors satisfy 37 a x b l a x b l x b l f a n d x b r a x b r x b r f and the total general nodal force vectors satisfy 37 b y b l a y b l y b l f a n d y b r a y b r y b r f where the superscript f denote the free fields the free field response at right artificial boundary is the result of 1d site response analysis under the action of horizontal or vertical seismic motion it should be noted that 1d site analysis can only reflect stratigraphic effects to reflect topographic irregularities in free field the relevant analytical methods zhang et al 2019a b can be applied to evaluate topographic effects the 1d site response satisfies the condition as presented in the equation 16 the equations satisfying the above condition can be obtained from a special case of equation 30 for wavenumber k 0 as follows 38 ω 2 m p 0 v y v a 0 m x x 0 0 0 m y y i ω j p 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 k p 0 0 h x k x x k x y h y h a k y x k y y x b r f 0 f b x f b y where the f b x f b y t is the force vector corresponding to displacement satisfying the above condition similarly the free field response at left artificial boundary can be also obtained the nodal forces y b l f and y b r f of free field part at the artificial boundary can be also obtained from a special case of equation 32 for x 0 as follows 39 y b l f e x b l f a n d y b r f e x b r f the scattering field can be accurately simulated by the proposed abc namely the scattering field displacement results satisfies the above equation 33 substitute equation 37 a into equations 33 and 34 then put the result and equation 39 into equation 37 b and finally into equation 36 after some manipulations the finite element equation in frequency domain can be obtained as follows 40 ω 2 m r r i ω c r r k r r ω 2 m r b l i ω c r b l k r b l ω 2 m r b r i ω c r b r k r b r ω 2

accuracy of the proposed abc then by free field problem the verification of the site response and seismic input method is carried out in the subsection 5 2 and finally by more practical finite element model of breakwater water seabed bedrock system further verification is presented in the subsection 5 3 5 1 abc validation abc fem coupling model of ocean site as shown in the fig 2 is established to verify the accuracy of abc the material constants of the ocean site are listed in table 1 the width of the abc fem coupled model is 6m an impulsive loading is applied at viewpoint d at the seabed surface the time history of the impulsive loading is written as 41 f t 16 t 3 h t 4 t 0 25 3 h t 0 25 6 t 0 5 3 h t 0 5 4 t 0 75 3 h t 0 75 t 1 3 h t 1 where t is time and h t is heaviside function the time history of the impulsive loading and the amplitude of its fourier spectrum are shown in fig 3 the mesh size of 0 2 m is used for spatial discretization the time step size is 0 002 s in the time domain analysis to find reliable reference results to the above problem extended 2d finite element model with a sufficiently large width of 300m in time domain is also used to solve this problem this large model can ensure that the interested region is not affected by the wave reflected back from the truncated boundary such computational time consuming solution in time domain is used as a reference one to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed abc the reason to solve the reference model in time domain is that the size of model in time domain within the period of interest can be easily determined by the wave velocity in the media but it is difficult to determine the appropriate dimensions of the model in the frequency domain it is pointed that the results using the proposed abc need to be transformed from the frequency to time domain by fourier transformation so as to be verified against the reference results the vertical displacement and pore pressure results at viewpoint d are shown in fig 4 moreover fig 5 a b and 5c show the spatial distributions of pore pressure horizontal displacement and vertical displacement in the ocean site at the time t 0 3s respectively left and right parts of the fig 5 are the results from partial extended model 20m x 20m and abc fem coupled model respectively it can be observed from figs 4 and 5 that the results from abc fem coupling model are completely consistent with the reference one from extended model indicating the high accuracy of the abc 5 2 seismic input validation in order to verify the correctness of the site response and seismic input methods the seismic free field problem as shown in the fig 6 is firstly presented in this section the width of the abc fem coupled model are 4 m the material constants are the same as those in the section 5 1 fig 7 shows the comparison of the results from the abc fem coupled model and the free field response reference under the vertical dirac impulse shown in fig 3 fig 7 consists of four subfigures namely a time histories of water pressure at water surface b time histories of pore pressure at seabed surface c vertical displacement at seabed surface and d vertical displacement at seabed bottom similarly fig 8 shows the comparison of the results under the horizontal dirac impulse time histories of pressures at water surface and seabed surface are not given in the case of horizontal excitation because their values are equal to zero it can be seen from figs 7 and 8 that comparison of the results from abc fem coupled model and reference are completely consistent indicating the correctness of the site response and seismic input methods 5 3 coupled model of breakwater water seabed bedrock system validation as shown in fig 9 the above method is applied herein to estimate the dynamic response of breakwater water seabed bedrock system under the horizontal dirac impulse to further verify the effectiveness of the above method except for material of breakwater the system material parameters are the same as those in section 5 2 material constants of the breakwater are listed in table 2 because of the high accuracy of proposed abc and considering the high efficiency of computation the artificial boundaries are located at two toes of the breakwater to form the smallest abc fem coupled model in this point the width l l and l r is zero to obtain the reference results extended abc fem coupled model with a larger width l l and l r of 40 m is also used to solve the seismic response of the system in the extended abc fem coupled model left and right artificial boundaries are located at a relatively distant location remaining geometry parameters of system are listed in table 3 two models should obtain the same results as long as the proposed method is effective fig 10 shows the comparison of the time history results of pore pressure horizontal acceleration and vertical acceleration at viewpoint a from the abc fem coupled model and the extended abc fem coupled model moreover fig 11 shows the spatial distributions of pore pressure horizontal acceleration and vertical acceleration in the system at the time t 0 3s left and right parts of fig 11 are the results from extended abc fem coupled model and abc fem coupled model respectively it can be seen from figs 10 and 11 that comparison of the results from the above two models are completely consistent indicating the effectiveness of the method in evaluating the dynamic response of breakwater water seabed bedrock system 6 seismic response of breakwater seawater seabed bedrock system the actual seismic motion record in the section is served as earthquake input to access the seismic response of breakwater seawater seabed bedrock system as shown in fig 9 abc fem coupled model with width l r l l 0 is used to simulate the seismic response of the system in sections 6 1 and 6 2 firstly in the subsection 6 1 preliminary analyses were performed to achieve two goals 1 to investigate the effects of linearized free surface condition on seismic response of breakwater 2 to seek unfavorable location about dynamic response of breakwater with different slope angle and then the effects of typical parameters such as slope angel θ water depth d 1 and seabed soil characteristics including porosity n 2 permeability coefficient k 2 and shear modulus g 2 on seismic response of breakwater are respectively discussed in the subsection 6 2 through a sensitivity analysis in addition the liquefaction analysis of underneath seabed foundation is presented in the subsection 6 3 via extended abc fem coupled model with width l r l l 40 6 1 preliminary analyses in the subsection for the purpose of more practical application the above method is applied to estimate the seismic response of breakwater seawater seabed bedrock system in this section the kobe seismic motion record served as input earthquake wave is shown in fig 12 the material and geometry parameters of the abc fem coupled model for the system are the same as those in section 5 3 6 1 1 effect of linearized free surface condition comparisons between linearized free surface condition case and static water case are made to examine the effects of free surface condition to seismic response of breakwater for linearized free surface condition case the abc fem coupled model are the same as those in subsection 5 3 in which the surface small wave is considered through equation 13 a for static water case it is assumed that the water is at rest so that water pressure remains zeros at the free surface as presented in equation 13 b the spatial distributions of the horizontal acceleration ratio β x vertical acceleration ratio β y and pore pressure ratio β p at the breakwater structure surface with slope angles θ 75 is displayed to quantificationally evaluate the effect of linearized free surface condition under horizontal seismic motion the β i i x y are the horizontal i x or vertical i y amplification factors defined as the ratio of the maximum horizontal or vertical acceleration at breakwater surface to the maximum horizontal acceleration at seabed surface of a flat ocean site due to the value of pore pressure at seabed surface of a flat ocean site under horizontal seismic motion is equal to zero β p is defined as the ratio of pore pressure at breakwater surface to hydrostatic pressure at seabed surface for the above two cases under horizontal seismic motion fig 13 shows the comparisons results of seismic response at the breakwater structure surface illustrating the negligible effect of linear free surface condition on the seismic response of breakwater fig 14 shows the comparisons results of seismic response at the breakwater structure surface under vertical seismic motion in the moment the β i i x y are amplification factors defined as the ratio of the maximum horizontal or vertical acceleration at breakwater surface of the system to the maximum vertical acceleration at seabed surface of a flat ocean site likewise β p is also defined as the ratio of pore pressure at breakwater surface to hydrostatic pressure at seabed surface the same conclusions also can be obtained from fig 14 for the case of vertical seismic motion in fact the experimental tests conducted by memos et al 2000 have been indicated that the dynamic pressure acting on seabed and breakwater induced by small surface wave generally accounts for a small percentage of the total pressure therefore linearized surface wave condition generally can be neglected during the evaluation to seismic response of breakwater 6 1 2 unfavorable location about dynamic response in breakwater with different slope angles under the horizontal seismic motion fig 15 also shows spatial distributions of the horizontal acceleration ratio β x vertical acceleration ratio β y and pore pressure ratio β p at the breakwater structure surface when slope angles θ of breakwater are 45 60 and 75 respectively it can be observed from the results in fig 15 that the spatial distribution shapes of β x along the breakwater surface are basically the same as the geometries of the breakwater with different slope angle due to the influence of the breakwater a certain quantity of vertical acceleration and pore pressure is recorded on the breakwater surface and the maximum value of vertical acceleration is about 40 110 of the horizontal acceleration at seabed surface of a flat ocean site for different slope angel the ratio β y decreases as the distance from the location of left and right top corners of breakwater increases and it reaches a maximum value near the left and right top corners of breakwater and reaches a minimum value at the center of the breakwater surface in addition the slope angel has significant effect on β p β x and β y larger the slope angle leads to larger acceleration amplification factor β x and β y near the left and right top corners of the breakwater but smaller the slope angle leads to larger pore pressure ratio β p near the toe of the breakwater under vertical seismic motion a numerical investigation similar to one described in the above paragraph is performed on the breakwater seawater seabed bedrock system due to the influence of the breakwater structure as shown in the fig 16 a certain quantity of horizontal acceleration is also recorded in the breakwater surface and the maximum value of horizontal acceleration is only about 5 15 of the vertical acceleration at seabed surface of a flat ocean site for different slope angel β y decreases as the distance from the center of the breakwater top increases β y reaches a maximum value at the center of the breakwater top the slope angel has relative more significant effect on β y larger the slope angle leads to larger vertical acceleration amplification factor β y near the center of the breakwater top because pore pressure ratio β p at identical depth of water is same the effect of slope angel on β p is relative smaller 6 2 sensitivity analysis in this section the influences of slope angle of breakwater θ water depth d 1 and seabed foundation properties here including the seabed porosity n 2 permeability coefficient k 2 and shear modulus g 2 on seismic response of breakwater are examined by a sensitivity analysis to obtain relative reliable conclusion five seismic motion records as shown in table 4 are selected as input earthquake waves the five earthquake records in the table 4 are denoted as record 1 record 2 record 3 record 4 and record 5 respectively the peak accelerations of the above earthquake records are modulated to 0 2g in this section the left top corner of breakwater is selected as the viewpoint under horizontal earthquake action through the above analysis in subsection 6 1 2 due to the vertical acceleration reaches a maximum value at the center of the breakwater top under vertical earthquake action the center of the breakwater top is selected as the viewpoint in this case unless otherwise indicated geometry and material parameters of numerical examples in the part are the same as those in subsection 5 3 6 2 1 effect of slope angle on seismic response of breakwater fig 17 shows the seismic peak response at viewpoints of breakwater with different slope angles θ θ 30 90 δ θ 15 under the horizontal seismic motion it is obvious in fig 17 that the seismic responses including horizontal acceleration vertical acceleration horizontal displacement and vertical displacement amplitude increases with the increasing of the inclination angle fig 18 shows the seismic peak response at viewpoints of breakwater with different slope angle under vertical seismic motion the horizontal acceleration and horizontal displacement at viewpoint are not given in this case because their value in the selected viewpoint is equal to zero it is obvious in fig 16 that compared with the effect of slope angle on the peak response under horizontal seismic motion the slope angel has insignificant effect on seismic peak response under vertical seismic motion 6 2 2 effect of water depth on seismic response of breakwater to evaluate effect of water depth on the seismic response of breakwater numerical investigation similar to the one described in above subsection is performed the dimensionless parameter are introduced as β a a d a f u l l and β u u d u f u l l where a d and u d are the peak acceleration and displacement at the viewpoint with different water depth d 1 d 1 3 15 m δ d 1 3 m under the above five earthquake records respectively a f u l l and u f u l l are the corresponding peak acceleration and displacement when the water depth is 15m respectively fig 19 shows the seismic peak response at the viewpoint of breakwater surrounded by different depth seawater under horizontal seismic motion it is obvious in fig 19 that the seismic responses including horizontal acceleration and displacement amplitude decreases with the increasing of water depth similarly under the vertical earthquake action the corresponding results are also shown in fig 20 it can be observed from fig 20 that the seismic response decreases with the increasing of water depth the reason may be that seismic motion energy is dissipated by the radiation damping of water 6 2 3 effect of seabed porosity on seismic response of breakwater in this part numerical investigation is performed to examine the sensitivity of seismic response of breakwater to the change of seabed porosity in the case except for seabed porosity n 2 the material parameters for the system are the same as those in the section 5 3 the dimensionless parameters β a a n 2 a and β u u n 2 u are adopted to quantitatively evaluate the effect of seabed porosity in which a n 2 and u n 2 are the peak acceleration and displacement at the selected viewpoints of breakwater built on seabed foundation with different porosity n 2 n 2 0 1 0 6 δ n 2 0 1 under the above five earthquake records respectively a and u are the corresponding peak acceleration and displacement when the seabed porosity is n 2 0 1 respectively fig 21 shows the seismic peak response including peak horizontal acceleration and displacement at the viewpoint of breakwater built on seabed with different porosity under horizontal seismic motion similarly under the vertical seismic motion the corresponding results are also shown in fig 22 it can be observed from figs 21 and 22 that there are less changes of peak displacement compared with peak acceleration with changes in seabed porosity the relative bigger shift of peak acceleration with changes in porosity can be seen under vertical seismic motion except for responses from record 4 under vertical seismic motion peak vertical acceleration response observed at the viewpoint of breakwater decreases as the increasing of seabed porosity 6 2 4 effect of seabed permeability on seismic response of breakwater in this part numerical examples are given to examine the effect of seabed foundation permeability to seismic response of breakwater figs 23 and 24 illustrate the peak response at viewpoints of breakwater built on seabed foundation with different permeability coefficient k 2 in figs 23 and 24 the dimensionless parameters β a a k 2 a and β u u k 2 u are employed in which a k 2 and u k 2 are the peak acceleration and displacement at the selected viewpoints of breakwater built on seabed foundation with different permeability coefficient k 2 k 2 10 3m s 10 4m s 10 5m s 10 6m s and 10 7m s respectively a and u are the peak acceleration and displacement as permeability coefficient k 2 is equal to 1 0 3 m s respectively as shown in the figs 23 and 24 there are evident differences in seismic peak response of breakwater built on seabed foundation with different permeability illustrating the significant effect of seabed foundation permeability on the seismic response of breakwater it can be seen from fig 23 the peak horizontal acceleration response at viewpoint undergoes continuous raise when permeability coefficient increases from 10 6m s to 10 3m s except for peak response from record 4 horizontal peak displacement increases with the increasing of permeability coefficient as shown in the fig 23 for the case of vertical seismic motion peak responses including vertical acceleration and displacement evidently increase with the increasing of permeability coefficient as shown in the fig 24 6 2 5 effect of seabed shear modulus on seismic response of breakwater figs 25 and 26 show the peak responses at the viewpoints of breakwater built on the seabed foundation with different shear modulus g 2 g 2 6 67 mpa 96 67 mpa δ g 2 30 mpa under the above five earthquake records similarly the dimensionless parameters β a a g 2 a and β u u g 2 u are used to evaluate the influence of shear modulus on seismic response of breakwater in which a g 2 and u g 2 are the peak acceleration and displacement at the selected viewpoints of breakwater built on seabed foundation with different shear modulus g 2 respectively a and u are the corresponding peak acceleration and displacement as shear modulus g 2 is equal to 6 67 mpa respectively from figs 25 and 26 it is found that shear modulus g 2 of the seabed foundation has more significant effect on the seismic response of breakwater than those from porosity and permeability of seabed foundation by comparison fig 25 with fig 26 we will find the influence of shear modulus on the seismic response of breakwater under horizontal earthquake is more noticeable than case under vertical earthquake as shown in the figs 25 and 26 the peak displacements at viewpoints reduce with the increasing of shear modulus but it can be seen from fig 26 that the opposite was true for the acceleration response under the vertical seismic motion 6 3 momentary liquefaction analysis relevant studies through experimental tests and numerical simulations reveal that the failure of breakwaters under earthquake become more severe when the liquefaction in underneath foundation occurs therefore the liquefaction analysis for foundation soil is indispensable if the structure is built on the liquefiable foundation generally as pointed in the reference sumer 2009 there are two generation mechanism of excess pore pressure in the seabed under the external loads such as earthquake wave storm and tsunami pore pressure that is directly generated by cycling excitation induced by earthquake and wave is often named as momentary pore pressure however pore pressure induced by the unrecoverable contraction of relatively loose soil skeleton under extreme load such as storm and tsunami is residual pore pressure in most marine seabed earthquake induced soil response is momentary in nature except for those induced by some extreme loading condition so the momentary liquefaction for breakwater seawater seabed bedrock system with three kinds of slope angle of breakwater θ i e 45 60 and 75 is evaluated in this section the liquefaction criterion proposed by jeng 1997 as presented in the inequation 42 is applied to characterize momentary liquefaction analysis for underneath seabed foundation the liquefaction criterion is also used in the references sui et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 in which the seabed consolidation induced by the breakwater weight is considered 42 p 2 p s s σ y 0 where p 2 is the momentary pore pressure response inside seabed foundation under seismic motion p s s is the pore pressure on seabed surface and σ y 0 is the initial vertical effective stress induced by gravity during the consolidation process it is noted that the seabed consolidation and section shape of breakwater should be taken into account to compute the initial vertical effective stress the spatial distribution of the initial vertical effective stress is shown in fig 27 it can be seen that the initial vertical effective stress is symmetrically distributed on the x y plane for brevity record 1 as shown in table 4 is selected as horizontal or vertical seismic motion in the liquefaction analysis under horizontal seismic motion at the time when peak pore pressure occurs spatial distributions of pore pressure and liquefaction zones are shown in fig 28 respectively as shown in fig 28 the pore pressure induced by horizontal seismic motion is antisymmetric it can be also observed from the figure the distribution of liquefaction zones in finite element model with various slope angle of breakwater is significantly different the main liquefaction zones distribute at the surface of seabed and the toe location of breakwater with the increasing of breakwater slope the liquefaction zones get larger similarly under the vertical seismic motion spatial distributions of pore pressure and liquefaction zones are shown in fig 29 it can be seen from the figure that the spatial distribution of pore pressure and liquefaction zones are both symmetric under the vertical seismic motion with the increase of breakwater slope the liquefaction zones get smaller as shown in the figs 28 and 29 the liquefaction zones distribute mainly at seabed surface and near the toe location of breakwater the reasons are as follows although the seismic wave induced dynamic pore pressure in upper part of seabed is less than that in lower part of seabed the seismic wave induced transient liquefaction still occurs in the upper part of seabed due to the fact that the overburdened weight of soil is relatively small in upper part of seabed load induced by gravity of breakwater disappears in the toe location resulting in the decrease of initial vertical effective stress pore pressure response near the toe location of the breakwater happen to a sharp increase as shown in the figs 28 and 29 7 conclusions this paper develops a new robust frequency domain model to evaluate the seismic response of breakwater water seabed bedrock system with full consideration of interactions among them the model contains near field finite element model accurate absorbing boundary condition abc and seismic wave input after verifying the accuracy of abc seismic wave input and coupled model of breakwater water seabed bedrock system the proposed model is used to investigate the seismic response of the breakwater and surrounding seabed the main conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 the proposed abc is accurate except for the error due to the spatial discretization along the depth direction combining of the proposed abc equivalent input seismic loads and near field finite element equation the obtained model is accurate in application of evaluating the seismic response of breakwater water seabed bedrock system 2 as the slope angle of the breakwater increases the peak response of the breakwater under horizontal seismic motion increases while the slope angle has insignificant effect on the peak response of the breakwater under vertical seismic motion peak response of the breakwater under horizontal or vertical seismic motion decreases with the increasing of water depth the reason may be that seismic motion energy is dissipated by the radiation damping of water and it is found that shear modulus of the seabed foundation has more significant effect on the seismic response of breakwater than those from porosity and permeability of seabed foundation 3 under horizontal or vertical seismic motion the main liquefaction zones distribute at the surface of seabed and toe location of the breakwater with the increasing of breakwater slope angle the liquefaction zones under horizontal seismic motion get larger while the liquefaction zones under vertical seismic motion decrease with the increasing of the slope angle because the final expression of the proposed abc is frequency domain dependent the method in solving the seismic response of breakwater water seabed bedrock system belongs to frequency domain method therefore the above proposed method can only solve the linear elasticity or equivalent linearization problem moreover only momentary liquefaction analysis can be carried out the time domain abc obtained from the proposed frequency domain abc should be studied to solve nonlinear problem and residual liquefaction in the near future author contributions statement zhao mi conceptualization methodology writing

system accurate absorbing boundary fluid poroelastic solid media seismic response momentary liquefaction 1 introduction breakwaters are one kind of hydraulic structures to protect from siltation of the alluvial soil and wave erosion to the coastline and to protect humans living near the coastline however relevant reports of the failure of breakwaters are not uncommon during strong earthquakes in the past two decades iai and kameoka 1993 sumer et al 2002 yüksel et al 2006 once the breakwaters are destroyed by earthquakes the damage will be unimaginable therefore it is of great significance to do in depth research on the seismic performance dynamic characteristics and failure mechanism of breakwaters during earthquakes generally there are two main kinds of environmental loadings for offshore structures one is the hydrodynamic loading induced by ocean waves and current the other is the earthquake loading ye and jeng 2013 dynamic responses and stability of marine structure under wave and current loadings have been numerically investigated by many researchers sarpkaya 2004 sumer 2009 young et al 2009 jeng 2003 to analyze the dynamic response of marine structure or seabed under hydrodynamic loading wave and current induced pressure derived from linear or nonlinear wave theory is simply applied to surface of seabed or structure in the research liu et al 2014 he 2017 wen and wang 2015 due to above techniques belong to non coupled ones the dynamic interactions among water seabed and marine structures have not been considered in recent years great progress has been achieved in numerical research li et al 2018 liao et al 2018a b tong et al 2017 on the dynamic response of marine structures under hydrodynamic loading in which one way coupling method with consideration of water structure interaction and seabed structure interaction is applied in models however the seabed water interaction is neglected in those models research on dynamic response of offshore structures and liquefaction of surrounding seabed induced by earthquake is relatively limited in the literature physic experiment kiara et al 2001 memos et al 2000 liu and zhu 2001 cihan and yuksel 2011 cihan et al 2012 were developed to evaluate the dynamic characters and stability of the breakwater under earthquake they found that breakwater will failure under strong earthquakes although the physic experiment is a fundamental method its high cost time consumption and distortion caused by scaled model are still inevitable barriers in studying the seismic response of breakwater numerical method as an alternative tool has become a more popular approach to investigating seismic response of the breakwater because of its low cost and good repeatability among there yang et al 2014 2016 established a finite element coupled model to analyze the seismic response of breakwater water foundation system with fluid structure interaction jafarian et al 2010 evaluated the earthquake induced permanent displacement of breakwater on a liquefiable layer in which accumulated excess pore water pressure model was embedded in the software flac to model pore pressure response due to lacking of poroelastic model for simulating sediment in above research yang et al 2014 2016 jafarian et al 2010 the influence of sediment on dynamic response of breakwater was ignored ye and jeng assessed the seismic response of a poroelastic unsaturated seabed and a rubble mound breakwater by two dimension 2d and three dimension 3d finite element model ye 2012 ye and jeng 2013 where the fixed boundary was applied on the left and right lateral sides of the seabed in their models a relatively large finite element zone was required to eliminate effect of the lateral boundary condition on the dynamic response in the region of interest besides both water structure interaction and seabed water interaction were ignored in their models chen and huang chen 2000 chen and huang 2002 developed a coupled model to estimate the seismic response of breakwater seawater seabed system in which the underneath bedrock haven t been incorporated into the numerical model in fact surrounding media of breakwater in ocean environment consist of water seabed and underlying bedrock however to the authors best knowledge the accurate model that can rigourously consider interaction between breakwater water seabed and underlying bedrock has not been available in the literature during solving seismic response of the breakwater the objective of this study is to develop a new robust frequency domain finite element model for seismic response of breakwater seawater seabed bedrock system with full consideration of interactions among them the rest part of this paper is organised as follows the seismic response problem of the breakwater seawater seabed bedrock system is stated in section 2 in section 3 an accurate absorbing boundary condition abc for far field of infinite domain is proposed in the frequency domain combination of the proposed abc equivalent input seismic loads and near field finite element equation the coupled model to evaluate the seismic response of breakwater water seabed bedrock system is obtained in section 4 numerical examples are given in section 5 to demonstrate the effectiveness of the coupled model the above coupled model is applied to investigate the effects of slope angle of breakwater water depth and seabed soil properties here including porosity permeability coefficient and shear modulus on seismic responses of the breakwater and the momentary liquefaction of seabed in the region near to the breakwater in section 6 conclusions follow in section 7 2 problem statement a typical 2d configuration of breakwater water seabed bedrock system under seismic motion is shown in fig 1 where the cartesian coordinate system x y is adopted in the model the origin of the cartesian coordinate system is located inside breakwater for numerical evaluation to the seismic response of breakwater seawater seabed bedrock system using finite element method fem two straight line shaped artificial boundaries are introduced to divide the whole domain into finite domain d left infinite domain ω l and right infinite domain ω r as shown in fig 1 the finite domain d that contains the breakwater can be numerically simulated by only fem the domain of breakwater is modeled as fluid saturated poroelastic medium with the relevant larger stiffness coefficients the breakwater and seabed foundation are tied together at the foundation breakwater interface where the contact nonlinearity is not considered assumed the surface of breakwater emerged from seawater is permeable and free the left or right infinite domain on both sides of the breakwater structure consist of water of depth d 1 seabed of total thickness d 2 and bedrock of total thickness d 3 they can be represented as the horizontally layered fluid poroelastic solid media with the surface interfacial and bottom physical boundaries denoted as γ s γ sp γ ps and γ r respectively the poroelastic medium for the breakwater and seabed is a kind of two phase medium whose governing equation has been developed by the biot s theory biot 1956a b biot 2004 and its equivalent form zienkiewicz 1982 zienkiewicz et al 1980 zienkiewicz and shiomi 1984 after truncating the infinite domain by introducing artificial boundaries abcs and the equivalent loads should be imposed on γ bl and γ br of the finite domain d to efficiently and accurately complete the finite element evaluation to breakwater seawater seabed bedrock system in the paper the left and right abcs will be mathematically derived from the following problem defined in ω l and ω r respectively the equivalent loads will also be obtained by combining 1d site response and the proposed abcs 2 1 wave equations 2 1 1 fluid medium for water the water is assumed to be an ideal compressible fluid medium whose governing equations are shown as

where the p consists sequentially of p 1 and p 2 by combining the same degree of freedom at the interface between the fluid and poroelastic media the u x and u y consists sequentially of u x 2 and u x 3 and of u y 2 and u y 3 respectively by combining the same degree of freedom at the interface between the poroelastic and solid media the load vector at the right hand side of equation 27 can also be obtained as follows f x 0 τ x y 3 y y 4 f y 0 σ y 3 y y 4 some coefficient matrices are extended from those given in subsections 3 1 to 3 3 by adding some zero elements k p k 1 0 0 0 h a h i 0 h i 0 1

standard finite element assembly the other coefficient matrices can be assembled from those given in subsections 3 1 to 3 3 as follows image 1 where the symbol x represents the sum of the matrix elements at the interface between two kinds of media it should be noted that the matrix m a derives from linearized free surface condition as presented in subsection 2 2 1 similarly both matrixes v a and h a are adopted to match fluid and seabed layer in the same way as presented in equation 27 general nodal force vector along whole γ br can be obtained by assembling equations 18 22 23 and 26 by applying the interface conditions equations 14b and 15a the relationship between the general nodal force vector y b r and correspondingly general nodal displacement vector x b r p u x u y t along whole γ br of finite domain d can be obtained as follows 28 y b r b 1 x b r x b 2 x b r x e x b r b 1 b p 0 0 0 b x x b x y 0 b y x b y y b 2 g p 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 e 0 0 0 s x e 1 x x e 1 x x s y e 1 y

general force and general displacement on the artificial boundary is obtained in this section the general nodal displacement vector along whole γ br satisfies following transformation 29 x b r x t x b r x ω e i ω t x b r k ω e i ω t k x where i is the imaginary unit k is the wavenumber in x direction ω is the circular frequency the x b r is the values of x b r in the frequency domain and x b r is the values of x b r in the frequency wavenumber domain the general force vector in equation 28 can be written in the same form as equation 29 by using equation 29 equation 27 can be transformed from the time space domain into following frequency wavenumber domain 30 k 2 b p i ω g p 0 0 0 b x x b x y 0 b y x b y y i k 0 ω 2 t x 0 s x e 1 x x e 2 x x e 1 x x e 2 x y s y e 1 y x e 2 y x e 1 y y e 2

after specifying the bottom boundary condition of bedrock equation 30 forms the eigenvalue problem on the wavenumber k in frequency wavenumber domain the eigenvalue problem can be solved by the method applied in the paper waas 1972 the frequency domain general nodal displacement solution along whole artificial boundary is a linear combination of the eigenvector from equation 30 it can be written as follows 31 x b r φ e x q where e x is the diagonal matrix of the diagonal entries e i k i x r where the k i is all the eigenvalues of equation 30 satisfying the radiation condition and x r is the x coordinate at right side of finite domain φ is the eigenvector matrix containing all the corresponding column eigenvectors and q is the undetermined coefficient column vector after transformation of equation 28 into the frequency domain the general nodal force vector of finite domain along whole γ br can be obtained as follows 32 y b r b x b r x e x b r with b b 1 i ω b 2 substituting equation 31 into equation 32 and then combining the result with equation 33 to eliminate the undermined coefficient q the dynamic stiffness relation along γ br can be obtained as follows 33 y b r s b r x b r with the dynamic stiffness matrix s b r i b φ κ φ 1 e where k is the diagonal matrix with the diagonal entries as all eigenvalues k i of equation 30 satisfying the radiation condition it should be noticed that the radiation condition is different between left artificial boundary and right those waas 1972 equation 33 is the frequency domain abc along whole γ br in the same way as presented in equation 33 the dynamic stiffness matrix s b l along whole γ bl can be also obtained as follows 34 y b l s b l x b l it should be noted that there are three obvious advantages of the proposed frequency domain abc compared to the existing those in time domain first after coupling with frequency domain finite element it can be used to estimate the amplification characteristic of the dynamic response of structures or topography that is independent of the input condition second instability phenomena will not be a concern during solving the accurate artificial boundary in this method however the frequency domain method can only be used to solve the linear elasticity or equivalent linearization problem in addition the time domain method is applicable to both linear and nonlinear problems but application of high precision artificial boundary conditions in the time domain may encounter the instability phenomenon third the proposed frequency domain method in this paper can easily account for hysteretic damping of the soils and the structures by the correspondence principle and the coupling procedure in this paper does not adopt any approximation 4 finite element coupled equation of breakwater water seabed bedrock system by combination the proposed abc and one dimension site response the accurate method applied to assess the seismic response of breakwater water seabed bedrock system is presented in this section in detail 4 1 finite element equation in the time domain the finite domain also can be discretized by the standard finite element technology in 2d space after the spatial discretization to above three kinds of media on the basis of full consideration about the interface conditions 13 16 the finite element equation can be obtained as follows 35 m r r m r b l m r

boundary right artificial boundary and the finite domain d respectively m c and k are the mass damping and stiffness matrices respectively and the definitions of x and y are the same as that in section 3 y r a denotes the loading acting on finite domain y b l a and y b r a are the force of infinite domain truncated by the artificial boundary on finite domain under the action of external loadings such as earthquakes 4 2 coupled equation equation 35 can be transformed into the frequency domain by fourier transformation it can be written as follows 36 ω 2 m r r i ω c r r k r r ω 2 m r b

r a x b l a x b r a y r a y b l a y b r a the total response at the artificial boundary can be decomposed into the scattering field response and the free field response based on the idea proposed in paper liu et al 2019 the total general nodal displacement and force vectors at the artificial boundary can be written as follows the total general nodal displacement vectors satisfy 37 a x b l a x b l x b l f a n d x b r a x b r x b r f and the total general nodal force vectors satisfy 37 b y b l a y b l y b l f a n d y b r a y b r y b r f where the superscript f denote the free fields the free field response at right artificial boundary is the result of 1d site response analysis under the action of horizontal or vertical seismic motion it should be noted that 1d site analysis can only reflect stratigraphic effects to reflect topographic irregularities in free field the relevant analytical methods zhang et al 2019a b can be applied to evaluate topographic effects the 1d site response satisfies the condition as presented in the equation 16 the equations satisfying the above condition can be obtained from a special case of equation 30 for wavenumber k 0 as follows 38 ω 2 m p 0 v y v a 0 m x x 0 0 0 m y y i ω j p 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 k p 0 0 h x k x x k x y h y h a k y x k y y x b r f 0 f b x f b y where the f b x f b y t is the force vector corresponding to displacement satisfying the above condition similarly the free field response at left artificial boundary can be also obtained the nodal forces y b l f and y b r f of free field part at the artificial boundary can be also obtained from a special case of equation 32 for x 0 as follows 39 y b l f e x b l f a n d y b r f e x b r f the scattering field can be accurately simulated by the proposed abc namely the scattering field displacement results satisfies the above equation 33 substitute equation 37 a into equations 33 and 34 then put the result and equation 39 into equation 37 b and finally into equation 36 after some manipulations the finite element equation in frequency domain can be obtained as follows 40 ω 2 m r r i ω c r r k r r ω 2 m r b l i ω c r b l k r b l ω 2 m r b r i ω c r b r k r b r ω 2

accuracy of the proposed abc then by free field problem the verification of the site response and seismic input method is carried out in the subsection 5 2 and finally by more practical finite element model of breakwater water seabed bedrock system further verification is presented in the subsection 5 3 5 1 abc validation abc fem coupling model of ocean site as shown in the fig 2 is established to verify the accuracy of abc the material constants of the ocean site are listed in table 1 the width of the abc fem coupled model is 6m an impulsive loading is applied at viewpoint d at the seabed surface the time history of the impulsive loading is written as 41 f t 16 t 3 h t 4 t 0 25 3 h t 0 25 6 t 0 5 3 h t 0 5 4 t 0 75 3 h t 0 75 t 1 3 h t 1 where t is time and h t is heaviside function the time history of the impulsive loading and the amplitude of its fourier spectrum are shown in fig 3 the mesh size of 0 2 m is used for spatial discretization the time step size is 0 002 s in the time domain analysis to find reliable reference results to the above problem extended 2d finite element model with a sufficiently large width of 300m in time domain is also used to solve this problem this large model can ensure that the interested region is not affected by the wave reflected back from the truncated boundary such computational time consuming solution in time domain is used as a reference one to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed abc the reason to solve the reference model in time domain is that the size of model in time domain within the period of interest can be easily determined by the wave velocity in the media but it is difficult to determine the appropriate dimensions of the model in the frequency domain it is pointed that the results using the proposed abc need to be transformed from the frequency to time domain by fourier transformation so as to be verified against the reference results the vertical displacement and pore pressure results at viewpoint d are shown in fig 4 moreover fig 5 a b and 5c show the spatial distributions of pore pressure horizontal displacement and vertical displacement in the ocean site at the time t 0 3s respectively left and right parts of the fig 5 are the results from partial extended model 20m x 20m and abc fem coupled model respectively it can be observed from figs 4 and 5 that the results from abc fem coupling model are completely consistent with the reference one from extended model indicating the high accuracy of the abc 5 2 seismic input validation in order to verify the correctness of the site response and seismic input methods the seismic free field problem as shown in the fig 6 is firstly presented in this section the width of the abc fem coupled model are 4 m the material constants are the same as those in the section 5 1 fig 7 shows the comparison of the results from the abc fem coupled model and the free field response reference under the vertical dirac impulse shown in fig 3 fig 7 consists of four subfigures namely a time histories of water pressure at water surface b time histories of pore pressure at seabed surface c vertical displacement at seabed surface and d vertical displacement at seabed bottom similarly fig 8 shows the comparison of the results under the horizontal dirac impulse time histories of pressures at water surface and seabed surface are not given in the case of horizontal excitation because their values are equal to zero it can be seen from figs 7 and 8 that comparison of the results from abc fem coupled model and reference are completely consistent indicating the correctness of the site response and seismic input methods 5 3 coupled model of breakwater water seabed bedrock system validation as shown in fig 9 the above method is applied herein to estimate the dynamic response of breakwater water seabed bedrock system under the horizontal dirac impulse to further verify the effectiveness of the above method except for material of breakwater the system material parameters are the same as those in section 5 2 material constants of the breakwater are listed in table 2 because of the high accuracy of proposed abc and considering the high efficiency of computation the artificial boundaries are located at two toes of the breakwater to form the smallest abc fem coupled model in this point the width l l and l r is zero to obtain the reference results extended abc fem coupled model with a larger width l l and l r of 40 m is also used to solve the seismic response of the system in the extended abc fem coupled model left and right artificial boundaries are located at a relatively distant location remaining geometry parameters of system are listed in table 3 two models should obtain the same results as long as the proposed method is effective fig 10 shows the comparison of the time history results of pore pressure horizontal acceleration and vertical acceleration at viewpoint a from the abc fem coupled model and the extended abc fem coupled model moreover fig 11 shows the spatial distributions of pore pressure horizontal acceleration and vertical acceleration in the system at the time t 0 3s left and right parts of fig 11 are the results from extended abc fem coupled model and abc fem coupled model respectively it can be seen from figs 10 and 11 that comparison of the results from the above two models are completely consistent indicating the effectiveness of the method in evaluating the dynamic response of breakwater water seabed bedrock system 6 seismic response of breakwater seawater seabed bedrock system the actual seismic motion record in the section is served as earthquake input to access the seismic response of breakwater seawater seabed bedrock system as shown in fig 9 abc fem coupled model with width l r l l 0 is used to simulate the seismic response of the system in sections 6 1 and 6 2 firstly in the subsection 6 1 preliminary analyses were performed to achieve two goals 1 to investigate the effects of linearized free surface condition on seismic response of breakwater 2 to seek unfavorable location about dynamic response of breakwater with different slope angle and then the effects of typical parameters such as slope angel θ water depth d 1 and seabed soil characteristics including porosity n 2 permeability coefficient k 2 and shear modulus g 2 on seismic response of breakwater are respectively discussed in the subsection 6 2 through a sensitivity analysis in addition the liquefaction analysis of underneath seabed foundation is presented in the subsection 6 3 via extended abc fem coupled model with width l r l l 40 6 1 preliminary analyses in the subsection for the purpose of more practical application the above method is applied to estimate the seismic response of breakwater seawater seabed bedrock system in this section the kobe seismic motion record served as input earthquake wave is shown in fig 12 the material and geometry parameters of the abc fem coupled model for the system are the same as those in section 5 3 6 1 1 effect of linearized free surface condition comparisons between linearized free surface condition case and static water case are made to examine the effects of free surface condition to seismic response of breakwater for linearized free surface condition case the abc fem coupled model are the same as those in subsection 5 3 in which the surface small wave is considered through equation 13 a for static water case it is assumed that the water is at rest so that water pressure remains zeros at the free surface as presented in equation 13 b the spatial distributions of the horizontal acceleration ratio β x vertical acceleration ratio β y and pore pressure ratio β p at the breakwater structure surface with slope angles θ 75 is displayed to quantificationally evaluate the effect of linearized free surface condition under horizontal seismic motion the β i i x y are the horizontal i x or vertical i y amplification factors defined as the ratio of the maximum horizontal or vertical acceleration at breakwater surface to the maximum horizontal acceleration at seabed surface of a flat ocean site due to the value of pore pressure at seabed surface of a flat ocean site under horizontal seismic motion is equal to zero β p is defined as the ratio of pore pressure at breakwater surface to hydrostatic pressure at seabed surface for the above two cases under horizontal seismic motion fig 13 shows the comparisons results of seismic response at the breakwater structure surface illustrating the negligible effect of linear free surface condition on the seismic response of breakwater fig 14 shows the comparisons results of seismic response at the breakwater structure surface under vertical seismic motion in the moment the β i i x y are amplification factors defined as the ratio of the maximum horizontal or vertical acceleration at breakwater surface of the system to the maximum vertical acceleration at seabed surface of a flat ocean site likewise β p is also defined as the ratio of pore pressure at breakwater surface to hydrostatic pressure at seabed surface the same conclusions also can be obtained from fig 14 for the case of vertical seismic motion in fact the experimental tests conducted by memos et al 2000 have been indicated that the dynamic pressure acting on seabed and breakwater induced by small surface wave generally accounts for a small percentage of the total pressure therefore linearized surface wave condition generally can be neglected during the evaluation to seismic response of breakwater 6 1 2 unfavorable location about dynamic response in breakwater with different slope angles under the horizontal seismic motion fig 15 also shows spatial distributions of the horizontal acceleration ratio β x vertical acceleration ratio β y and pore pressure ratio β p at the breakwater structure surface when slope angles θ of breakwater are 45 60 and 75 respectively it can be observed from the results in fig 15 that the spatial distribution shapes of β x along the breakwater surface are basically the same as the geometries of the breakwater with different slope angle due to the influence of the breakwater a certain quantity of vertical acceleration and pore pressure is recorded on the breakwater surface and the maximum value of vertical acceleration is about 40 110 of the horizontal acceleration at seabed surface of a flat ocean site for different slope angel the ratio β y decreases as the distance from the location of left and right top corners of breakwater increases and it reaches a maximum value near the left and right top corners of breakwater and reaches a minimum value at the center of the breakwater surface in addition the slope angel has significant effect on β p β x and β y larger the slope angle leads to larger acceleration amplification factor β x and β y near the left and right top corners of the breakwater but smaller the slope angle leads to larger pore pressure ratio β p near the toe of the breakwater under vertical seismic motion a numerical investigation similar to one described in the above paragraph is performed on the breakwater seawater seabed bedrock system due to the influence of the breakwater structure as shown in the fig 16 a certain quantity of horizontal acceleration is also recorded in the breakwater surface and the maximum value of horizontal acceleration is only about 5 15 of the vertical acceleration at seabed surface of a flat ocean site for different slope angel β y decreases as the distance from the center of the breakwater top increases β y reaches a maximum value at the center of the breakwater top the slope angel has relative more significant effect on β y larger the slope angle leads to larger vertical acceleration amplification factor β y near the center of the breakwater top because pore pressure ratio β p at identical depth of water is same the effect of slope angel on β p is relative smaller 6 2 sensitivity analysis in this section the influences of slope angle of breakwater θ water depth d 1 and seabed foundation properties here including the seabed porosity n 2 permeability coefficient k 2 and shear modulus g 2 on seismic response of breakwater are examined by a sensitivity analysis to obtain relative reliable conclusion five seismic motion records as shown in table 4 are selected as input earthquake waves the five earthquake records in the table 4 are denoted as record 1 record 2 record 3 record 4 and record 5 respectively the peak accelerations of the above earthquake records are modulated to 0 2g in this section the left top corner of breakwater is selected as the viewpoint under horizontal earthquake action through the above analysis in subsection 6 1 2 due to the vertical acceleration reaches a maximum value at the center of the breakwater top under vertical earthquake action the center of the breakwater top is selected as the viewpoint in this case unless otherwise indicated geometry and material parameters of numerical examples in the part are the same as those in subsection 5 3 6 2 1 effect of slope angle on seismic response of breakwater fig 17 shows the seismic peak response at viewpoints of breakwater with different slope angles θ θ 30 90 δ θ 15 under the horizontal seismic motion it is obvious in fig 17 that the seismic responses including horizontal acceleration vertical acceleration horizontal displacement and vertical displacement amplitude increases with the increasing of the inclination angle fig 18 shows the seismic peak response at viewpoints of breakwater with different slope angle under vertical seismic motion the horizontal acceleration and horizontal displacement at viewpoint are not given in this case because their value in the selected viewpoint is equal to zero it is obvious in fig 16 that compared with the effect of slope angle on the peak response under horizontal seismic motion the slope angel has insignificant effect on seismic peak response under vertical seismic motion 6 2 2 effect of water depth on seismic response of breakwater to evaluate effect of water depth on the seismic response of breakwater numerical investigation similar to the one described in above subsection is performed the dimensionless parameter are introduced as β a a d a f u l l and β u u d u f u l l where a d and u d are the peak acceleration and displacement at the viewpoint with different water depth d 1 d 1 3 15 m δ d 1 3 m under the above five earthquake records respectively a f u l l and u f u l l are the corresponding peak acceleration and displacement when the water depth is 15m respectively fig 19 shows the seismic peak response at the viewpoint of breakwater surrounded by different depth seawater under horizontal seismic motion it is obvious in fig 19 that the seismic responses including horizontal acceleration and displacement amplitude decreases with the increasing of water depth similarly under the vertical earthquake action the corresponding results are also shown in fig 20 it can be observed from fig 20 that the seismic response decreases with the increasing of water depth the reason may be that seismic motion energy is dissipated by the radiation damping of water 6 2 3 effect of seabed porosity on seismic response of breakwater in this part numerical investigation is performed to examine the sensitivity of seismic response of breakwater to the change of seabed porosity in the case except for seabed porosity n 2 the material parameters for the system are the same as those in the section 5 3 the dimensionless parameters β a a n 2 a and β u u n 2 u are adopted to quantitatively evaluate the effect of seabed porosity in which a n 2 and u n 2 are the peak acceleration and displacement at the selected viewpoints of breakwater built on seabed foundation with different porosity n 2 n 2 0 1 0 6 δ n 2 0 1 under the above five earthquake records respectively a and u are the corresponding peak acceleration and displacement when the seabed porosity is n 2 0 1 respectively fig 21 shows the seismic peak response including peak horizontal acceleration and displacement at the viewpoint of breakwater built on seabed with different porosity under horizontal seismic motion similarly under the vertical seismic motion the corresponding results are also shown in fig 22 it can be observed from figs 21 and 22 that there are less changes of peak displacement compared with peak acceleration with changes in seabed porosity the relative bigger shift of peak acceleration with changes in porosity can be seen under vertical seismic motion except for responses from record 4 under vertical seismic motion peak vertical acceleration response observed at the viewpoint of breakwater decreases as the increasing of seabed porosity 6 2 4 effect of seabed permeability on seismic response of breakwater in this part numerical examples are given to examine the effect of seabed foundation permeability to seismic response of breakwater figs 23 and 24 illustrate the peak response at viewpoints of breakwater built on seabed foundation with different permeability coefficient k 2 in figs 23 and 24 the dimensionless parameters β a a k 2 a and β u u k 2 u are employed in which a k 2 and u k 2 are the peak acceleration and displacement at the selected viewpoints of breakwater built on seabed foundation with different permeability coefficient k 2 k 2 10 3m s 10 4m s 10 5m s 10 6m s and 10 7m s respectively a and u are the peak acceleration and displacement as permeability coefficient k 2 is equal to 1 0 3 m s respectively as shown in the figs 23 and 24 there are evident differences in seismic peak response of breakwater built on seabed foundation with different permeability illustrating the significant effect of seabed foundation permeability on the seismic response of breakwater it can be seen from fig 23 the peak horizontal acceleration response at viewpoint undergoes continuous raise when permeability coefficient increases from 10 6m s to 10 3m s except for peak response from record 4 horizontal peak displacement increases with the increasing of permeability coefficient as shown in the fig 23 for the case of vertical seismic motion peak responses including vertical acceleration and displacement evidently increase with the increasing of permeability coefficient as shown in the fig 24 6 2 5 effect of seabed shear modulus on seismic response of breakwater figs 25 and 26 show the peak responses at the viewpoints of breakwater built on the seabed foundation with different shear modulus g 2 g 2 6 67 mpa 96 67 mpa δ g 2 30 mpa under the above five earthquake records similarly the dimensionless parameters β a a g 2 a and β u u g 2 u are used to evaluate the influence of shear modulus on seismic response of breakwater in which a g 2 and u g 2 are the peak acceleration and displacement at the selected viewpoints of breakwater built on seabed foundation with different shear modulus g 2 respectively a and u are the corresponding peak acceleration and displacement as shear modulus g 2 is equal to 6 67 mpa respectively from figs 25 and 26 it is found that shear modulus g 2 of the seabed foundation has more significant effect on the seismic response of breakwater than those from porosity and permeability of seabed foundation by comparison fig 25 with fig 26 we will find the influence of shear modulus on the seismic response of breakwater under horizontal earthquake is more noticeable than case under vertical earthquake as shown in the figs 25 and 26 the peak displacements at viewpoints reduce with the increasing of shear modulus but it can be seen from fig 26 that the opposite was true for the acceleration response under the vertical seismic motion 6 3 momentary liquefaction analysis relevant studies through experimental tests and numerical simulations reveal that the failure of breakwaters under earthquake become more severe when the liquefaction in underneath foundation occurs therefore the liquefaction analysis for foundation soil is indispensable if the structure is built on the liquefiable foundation generally as pointed in the reference sumer 2009 there are two generation mechanism of excess pore pressure in the seabed under the external loads such as earthquake wave storm and tsunami pore pressure that is directly generated by cycling excitation induced by earthquake and wave is often named as momentary pore pressure however pore pressure induced by the unrecoverable contraction of relatively loose soil skeleton under extreme load such as storm and tsunami is residual pore pressure in most marine seabed earthquake induced soil response is momentary in nature except for those induced by some extreme loading condition so the momentary liquefaction for breakwater seawater seabed bedrock system with three kinds of slope angle of breakwater θ i e 45 60 and 75 is evaluated in this section the liquefaction criterion proposed by jeng 1997 as presented in the inequation 42 is applied to characterize momentary liquefaction analysis for underneath seabed foundation the liquefaction criterion is also used in the references sui et al 2017 zhao et al 2017 in which the seabed consolidation induced by the breakwater weight is considered 42 p 2 p s s σ y 0 where p 2 is the momentary pore pressure response inside seabed foundation under seismic motion p s s is the pore pressure on seabed surface and σ y 0 is the initial vertical effective stress induced by gravity during the consolidation process it is noted that the seabed consolidation and section shape of breakwater should be taken into account to compute the initial vertical effective stress the spatial distribution of the initial vertical effective stress is shown in fig 27 it can be seen that the initial vertical effective stress is symmetrically distributed on the x y plane for brevity record 1 as shown in table 4 is selected as horizontal or vertical seismic motion in the liquefaction analysis under horizontal seismic motion at the time when peak pore pressure occurs spatial distributions of pore pressure and liquefaction zones are shown in fig 28 respectively as shown in fig 28 the pore pressure induced by horizontal seismic motion is antisymmetric it can be also observed from the figure the distribution of liquefaction zones in finite element model with various slope angle of breakwater is significantly different the main liquefaction zones distribute at the surface of seabed and the toe location of breakwater with the increasing of breakwater slope the liquefaction zones get larger similarly under the vertical seismic motion spatial distributions of pore pressure and liquefaction zones are shown in fig 29 it can be seen from the figure that the spatial distribution of pore pressure and liquefaction zones are both symmetric under the vertical seismic motion with the increase of breakwater slope the liquefaction zones get smaller as shown in the figs 28 and 29 the liquefaction zones distribute mainly at seabed surface and near the toe location of breakwater the reasons are as follows although the seismic wave induced dynamic pore pressure in upper part of seabed is less than that in lower part of seabed the seismic wave induced transient liquefaction still occurs in the upper part of seabed due to the fact that the overburdened weight of soil is relatively small in upper part of seabed load induced by gravity of breakwater disappears in the toe location resulting in the decrease of initial vertical effective stress pore pressure response near the toe location of the breakwater happen to a sharp increase as shown in the figs 28 and 29 7 conclusions this paper develops a new robust frequency domain model to evaluate the seismic response of breakwater water seabed bedrock system with full consideration of interactions among them the model contains near field finite element model accurate absorbing boundary condition abc and seismic wave input after verifying the accuracy of abc seismic wave input and coupled model of breakwater water seabed bedrock system the proposed model is used to investigate the seismic response of the breakwater and surrounding seabed the main conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 the proposed abc is accurate except for the error due to the spatial discretization along the depth direction combining of the proposed abc equivalent input seismic loads and near field finite element equation the obtained model is accurate in application of evaluating the seismic response of breakwater water seabed bedrock system 2 as the slope angle of the breakwater increases the peak response of the breakwater under horizontal seismic motion increases while the slope angle has insignificant effect on the peak response of the breakwater under vertical seismic motion peak response of the breakwater under horizontal or vertical seismic motion decreases with the increasing of water depth the reason may be that seismic motion energy is dissipated by the radiation damping of water and it is found that shear modulus of the seabed foundation has more significant effect on the seismic response of breakwater than those from porosity and permeability of seabed foundation 3 under horizontal or vertical seismic motion the main liquefaction zones distribute at the surface of seabed and toe location of the breakwater with the increasing of breakwater slope angle the liquefaction zones under horizontal seismic motion get larger while the liquefaction zones under vertical seismic motion decrease with the increasing of the slope angle because the final expression of the proposed abc is frequency domain dependent the method in solving the seismic response of breakwater water seabed bedrock system belongs to frequency domain method therefore the above proposed method can only solve the linear elasticity or equivalent linearization problem moreover only momentary liquefaction analysis can be carried out the time domain abc obtained from the proposed frequency domain abc should be studied to solve nonlinear problem and residual liquefaction in the near future author contributions statement zhao mi conceptualization methodology writing

clukey and morrison 1993 cao et al 2002 the mechanisms of the reverse end bearing failure under undrained conditions were investigated systematically more recently through experimental work mana et al 2013 and numerical simulations chatterjee et al 2013 however the uplift capacity of the bucket foundations is influenced by the degree of drainage of excess pore pressure which primarily depends on the rate of loading hydraulic conductivity of the soil and the length of the drainage path erbrich 1994 examined the tensile capacity of a suction bucket foundation on a dense silica sand and found

thieken et al 2014 shen et al 2017 and the cyclic foundation response cerfontaine et al 2016 for buckets in sand under different drainage conditions drained and undrained uplift tests in clay were

model all of the calculations were carried out using the abaqus program version 6 11 3 dassault systèmes 2011 2 1 finite element mesh and material properties axisymmetrical models were established to analyse the vertical pullout capacity of the bucket foundations the outside diameter of the bucket foundation maintained constant of d 5 m bucket foundations fall different category from suction piles

75 and 1 with a thickness of t 0 03 m which is typical of field conditions dnv gl 2017 the value of the wall thickness for design is selected to ensure the structural capacity during installation phase and in the operational phase the skirt tip resistance only contributes a small proportion to the foundation capacity all of the results presented in this paper are the normalised quantities which are independent of the selected dimensions the bucket foundations were pre embedded in the subsoil and modeled as a rigid body with a reference point rp at the level of top plate the pullout load can be recovered from the rp for given vertical displacement the foundations were modeled using the first order axisymmetrical quadrilaterals with reduced integration refer to cax4r for the abaqus standard element index since the top plates and the skirts were impermeable the soil domain was discretised using the first order axisymmetrical quadrilaterals with pore pressure refer to cax4p since that second order elements are unfavorable in problems involving contacts the mesh boundaries extended a distance of 10d from the edge and the tip of the foundation based on the mesh check to isolate the boundary effect fig 2 the mesh of the model has been verified to be fine enough for the analysis intermediate between the top plate and the soil plug was a layer of water elements with a thickness of tw 0 01 m to simulate the possible gap filled with pore water during extraction under partially drained conditions the provision of the water elements can transfer the pore pressure between the soil and the lid but not effective stress the water elements were first adopted by cao et al 2002 for finite element analysis of behavior of suction buckets in clay and by thieken et al 2014 for the suction buckets in sand under tension the water elements are normal coupled pore fluid elements assigned with linear elastic property with very low elastic modulus and a high permeability thieken et al 2014 verified that the effect of the water elements on the pullout capacity was negligible given that the young modulus of the water elements ew was sufficiently small not transmitting significant effective tensile stress the same value of ew 1 10 8kpa was taken in this paper as suggested by thieken et al 2014 the poisson s ratio of the water elements was defined as 0 495 since the pore water was considered incompressible the water elements were modeled using the element type of cax4p with a void ratio of ew 1 and permeability kw 1 m s 2 2 boundary conditions and interface properties the nodal displacement at the vertical side of the mesh was constrained in the radial direction and fixed at the base fig 2 pore water flow was permitted across top frees surface but not across the side and base boundaries of the mesh flow across the external vertical sides or base of the mesh was not expected as the zones of excess pore pressure generation were confined close to the foundation remote from the external boundaries the top and bottom of the water element were fully bonded with the top plate and soil plug respectively the tangential behavior of the interface between the external and internal surface of the skirt and the soil was rough where the limit shaft friction was defined by the shear strength of the soil hard contact was used to model the normal behavior of the interface and no separation was permitted considering the pure vertical motion of the foundation finite sliding tracking approach was employed for the simulation where the large deformation between the skirts and the soil was involved the skirt tip of the bucket was fully boned with the soil and no water elements were included 2 3 soil parameters the critical state soil mechanics model in abaqus clay plasticity was used with model parameters to represent modified cam clay mcc roscoe and burland 1968 the implementation of mcc in abaqus uses a mises surface in the π plane and associated flow by defining the flow stress ratio as unity the numerical parameters used for the analysis are summarised in table 1 the soil was initially k0 consolidated with k0 1 sinϕ tc where ϕ tc is the friction angle for the triaxial compression conditions a uniform surcharge σvs 6 kpa was applied at the upper soil surface to provide a nominal non zero value of shear strength at the mudline the undrained shear strength profile was determined from the mcc input parameters using the expression proposed by potts and zdravkovic 1999 1 s u σ v 1 2 k 0 3 g θ c o s θ 1 a 2 2 1 κ λ with g θ s i n ϕ c s c o s θ 1 3 s i n ϕ c s s i n θ a 3 1 k 0 g 30 1 2 k 0 where θ is the lode s angle and ϕ c s the critical state angle of shearing resistance the value of θ is taken as 0 and 30 to present the shear strength under plane strain and triaxial compression condition respectively 2 4 analysis procedure after establishing the in situ stress conditions the bucket foundation was preloaded instantaneously to a proportion of the undrained vertical bearing capacity vu which is equivalent to the undrained tensile capacity to represent the self weight of the superstructure and the ballast allowing for generation of the excess pore pressure subsequently the preload was held constant and dissipation of the pore pressure was permitted the bucket foundation was then pulled out vertically to failure under displacement control with varying normalised velocities v 10 4 10 3 10 2 0 1 1 10 100 and 500 the normalised velocity was defined as 2 v v s c v w s c v t where v is the uplift velocity w is the vertical displacement t is the time for the action of the uplift load and s is the characteristic length of the drainage path expressed as mana et al 2014 3 s l m i n π 1 0 14 d l the coefficient of consolidation cv was calculated 4 c v k 1 e 0 σ v 0 λ γ w where k is the soil permeability λ is slope of the normally consolidated line in e ln p plane γw is the unit weight of the pore water e0 and σ v0 are the initial void ratio and in situ effective vertical stress 3 results 3 1 uplift capacities under undrained and drained conditions the variation of the uplift force ftot versus the foundation displacement is plotted as a function of the normalised uplift velocity v for l d 0 5 in fig 3 the uplift capacity presented in fig 3 converged to that for v 100 even though the adopted largest normalised velocity was 500 and no further reduction in the uplift capacity occurred when the value of v was below 10 3 fig 3 shows that the tensile capacity reduced from the upper limit for v 102 to the lower limit for 10 3 as the uplift velocity decreased three modes of failure were proposed by deng and carter 2002 corresponding to different drainage conditions as shown in fig 4 the development of the components including the suction force fwp i e the integration negative excess pore pressure across the base plate the external frictional force fext and internal frictional force fint are plotted in fig 5 together with the total uplift force as a function of the vertical displacement w for v 102 and 10 3 which bracket the foundation reaction under the fast loading rate the suction beneath the top plate has no sufficient time to dissipate fig 5a the contours of the foundation displacement relative to the soil for v 102 are presented in fig 6 a where the displacement of the whole soil plug is evident and the deformation of the water elements is hardly visible indicating that the detachment of top plate from the soil plug is prevented by the suction beneath the top plate the relative shear deformation of the soil localised at the external surface of the shaft implies that only the external frictional resistance is mobilised the total displacement vectors of the soil representing the failure mechanisms are shown in fig 6b for v 102 compared with fig 4a for the undrained uplift fig 3 indicates that no more additional capacity can be mobilised when the uplift velocity v 102 and fig 6 shows the reverse end bearing failure mechanism has been fully mobilised at v 102 therefore the undrained condition can be confirmed to be achieved by v 102 by contrast drained condition can be verified via negligible suction pressure during extraction fig 5b leading to the detachment of the top plate from the soil plug and the formation of a gap fig 4b significant expansion of the water elements indicates that the top plate separated from the soil plug under the action of pullout loading for v 10 3 in the absence of the suction fig 7 the vertical displacement vectors localised at the shaft indicate only shear failure occurs across the internal and external surface of the shaft fig 7 it is convinced by the fe results that the drained condition is achieved by an uplift velocity of v 10 3 under undrained condition the overall tensile capacity of the bucket foundations can be estimated from reverse end bearing capacity at the tip level and from the external friction along the shaft the uplift capacity of the foundation is given by 5 f u n c v s u 0 a α s u a v g a e x t where ncv is the end bearing capacity factor su0 is the undrained shear strength under triaxial extension at the tip level α is the shaft friction ratio i e the ratio of the mobilised shear stress to the undrained shear strength su avg is the average undrained shear strength over the shaft and aext is the external surface area of the shaft the fe results of the undrained tensile capacity for l d 0 5 were plotted in fig 5 together with the upper and lower bound limits for the compressive bearing capacity martin 2001 comparison of the fe results of the dimensionless uplift capacity fu asu0 are summarised in table 2 with the analytical solutions for other aspect ratios martin 2001 indicating nearly full reverse end bearing was achieved as observed in the centrifuge tests mana et al 2013 the fe results of the external friction show excellent agreement with the prediction of second part of equation 5 with α 1 and the calculated end bearing capacity factor was 8 6 for l d 0 5 compared with the ncv 9 suggested in api 2011 the values of ncv varied from 9 8 for l d 0 1 to 7 7 for l d 1 based on the fe results the soil resistance of the foundations under fully drained conditions is governed by shaft friction along the external and internal surface i e 6 f d a e x t a i n t τ d a v g where aint is the surface area of the internal face of the shaft and τd avg the average limit shear stress over the length of the shaft the derivation of τd avg is provided in appendix a the fe results of the shaft friction agree well the analytical value that derived from equation 6 fig 5b comparison of the fe results of the undrained and drained capacity with analytical solutions confirms the viability of the fe modelling 3 2 partially drained uplift capacity for bucket foundations for intermediate uplift velocity the suction can only partially dissipate and the soil failure generally occurs across the bottom of the bucket fig 4c unlike the undrained case where the contributions of the submerged weight of the soil plug and the overburden cancel out contributions to the pullout resistance for partially drained condition consist of the suction the submerged weight of the soil plug and the external friction the contribution of the submerged weight is reflected by mobilisation of the internal friction which ensures the equilibrium of the soil plug the variations of the suction developed at the top plate mobilised external and internal friction are shown in fig 8 for varying v respectively the magnitude of the suction decreased with decreasing uplift velocity indicating flow of the pore water from outside into the inside of the foundation fig 8a the mobilised internal shaft friction is linked to the relative shear deformation of the soil plug to the foundation increasing as the uplift velocity decreased and the suction dissipated fig 8c by contrast the available external shaft resistance increased as the normalised velocity reduced from v 102 to v 1 after which any decrease in the uplift velocity led to reduced external shaft resistance till the drained capacity was achieved the two distinct responses of the development of the external and internal friction were found by thieken et al 2014 however the results are explained here from two perspectives first the magnitude of the excess pore pressure por inside the soil plug and outside the skirt is shown in fig 9 for v 102 10 1 and 10 2 the suction developed within the soil plug cannot dissipate for v 102 fig 9a and a flow field had no time to form so that the negative excess pore pressure extended deeper into the soil below the skirt tip the zone close to the external shaft was not influenced under partially drained conditions a proportion of the suction within the plug dissipate outside of the skirts and the influenced zone along the external shaft increased with decreasing v fig 9b and c as v reduced further when the drained condition was achieved the suction dissipated mainly inside the skirts which is generally less than 1 kpa fig 9d the contour of the excess pore pressure reflected the extent and magnitude of increase in the effective stress and hence the external friction therefore the stress paths in the p q and e ln p plane for a representative soil element see fig 2 at the depth of 0 75 l are presented in fig 10 for different normalised velocities to look more insights into the variation of the external shaft friction for v 102 the void ratio e maintained at the initial value and the mobilised shear stress is equivalent to the in situ shear strength as the uplift velocity v reduced from 102 to 1 the suction can partially dissipate with the influenced zone extending towards outside of the skirts fig 9b and c leading to an increase in effective stress and volume contraction of the soil elements fig 10b and hence an increase in the shear strength fig 10a the stress path for v 1 shows the most significant increase in the mobilised shear strength however as the normalised uplift velocity decreased further and become less than 0 01 the time required for completion of the extraction was sufficient for inflow of the water into the element to compensate the volume expansion so that the generation of the negative excess pore pressure was negligible within the soil plug and in vicinity of the external skirts therefore the stress path for v 10 2 virtually followed the initial yield surface fig 10a the effective stress decreased as a result of the volume expansion of the soil elements therefore the mobilised external friction increased first to the maximum value as v reduced from 102 to 1 and then decreased until the drained condition was approached the variation of the uplift capacities with the normalised of velocity is presented in fig 11 as a function of the foundation aspect ratios the uplift capacity increases from the drained limit to the undrained limit with increasing uplift velocity for given foundation aspect ratio a unique response using equation 7 was proposed to describe the normalised uplift capacities for any given drainage condition as shown in fig 12 a 7 f f d f u f d 1 1 v v 50 1 09 where v50 is the normalised velocity at which the pullout resistance defines the average of the undrained and drained limits the values of v50 show a linear function of the foundation aspect ratio fig 12b 8 v 50 0 73 l d 0 037 ultimately the uplift capacity can be expressed explicitly as a function of the pullout velocity soil permeability and foundation geometry by substituting equations 2 3 and 8 into equation 7 giving 9 f f u f d 1 v d l d 0 14 c v 0 73 l d 0 037 1 09 f d 3 3 uplift capacity of the bucket foundations considering preloading the effect of the vertical preloading due to the self weight of the superstructure or the additional ballast is investigated in this section the excess pore pressure due to the preloading dissipates and the shear strength of the soil increases due to the soil consolidation fig 13 shows an example of the variation of uplift capacity for v 100 with increasing magnitude of vertical preload fp following the completion of the full primary consolidation for the aspect ratio of l d 0 5 the undrained and drained uplift capacities following the completion of the fully primary consolidation are shown in fig 14 a and b as a function of the vertical preloading fp fu the gain in the uplift capacity due to the consolidation linearly increases with increasing vertical preload the undrained and drained uplift capacities can be predicted using equation 10a and b respectively 10a f c u f u 1 1 0 47 l d f p f u 10b f c d f d 1 0 735 0 41 l d f p f u the gain in the undrained uplift capacity is dominant by the increase of the soil shear strength at the tip level whereas the increase in drained capacity is owing to the set up of the skirt friction therefore the gradient in equation 10 b is significantly smaller than equation 10 a the response of the variation of the uplift capacity considering the effect of preloading is plotted in fig 15 by taking advantage of the strategies for normalisation where the corresponding undrained and drained limits due to consolidation are adopted the responses for different magnitudes of preload are practically identical for given aspect ratio and consistent with the corresponding case when the preload is absent therefore the following equation with identical format of equation 9 can be used to describe the response of the capacity for given uplift velocity fc 11 f c f c d f c u f c d 1 1 v v 50 1 09 where the fcu and fcd are respectively the undrained and drained uplift capacity and v50 the normalised uplift velocity at which the normalised resistance is midway between fcu and fcd equation 8 3 4 design procedures an example application for a bucket foundation is presented in this section to demonstrate the procedure to estimate the uplift capacity using the results obtained from the numerical analyses the input parameters including the foundation geometry soil properties and the preload are summarised in table 3 assuming the excess pore pressure fully dissipates at the end of life of service of the foundation the following steps show the procedure to determine the capacity of the bucket foundation under uplift velocity of v 8 33 mm h the calculated results for the individual step below are presented in table 4 step 1 calculate the undrained and drained limits of the uplift capacity without preloading using equations 5 and 6 respectively step 2 estimate the length of the drainage path for given l d with equation 3 and calculate the normalised uplift velocity using equation 2 step 3 estimate v50 by equation 8 step 4 predict the undrained and drained uplift capacity considering the effect of preloading using equation 10a and b respectively step 5 determine the uplift capacity for given velocity using equation 11 4 conclusions the tensile capacity of bucket foundation in clay has been investigated through finite element analysis the effects of the foundation aspect ratio the rate of pullout relative to the soil permeability and the vertical preloading have been examined systematically aspects of the research outcome include the uplift capacity can be determined from the reverse end bearing capacity and the external shaft resistance drained capacity is ultimately achieved where the frictional resistance along external and internal surface governs the failure the undrained and drained tensile capacity following the completion of the primary consolidation increase linearly with increasing preloading an analytical solution is proposed for predicting the tensile capacity of bucket foundations with various different aspect ratios and under different drainage conditions finally a design

between the soil and the lid but not effective stress the water elements were first adopted by cao et al 2002 for finite element analysis of behavior of suction buckets in clay and by thieken et al 2014 for the suction buckets in sand under tension the water elements are normal coupled pore fluid elements assigned with linear elastic property with very low elastic modulus and a high permeability thieken et al 2014 verified that the effect of the water elements on the pullout capacity was negligible given that the young modulus of the water elements ew was sufficiently small not transmitting significant effective tensile stress the same value of ew 1 10 8kpa was taken in this paper as suggested by thieken et al 2014 the poisson s ratio of the water elements was defined as 0 495 since the pore water was considered incompressible the water elements were modeled using the element type of cax4p with a void ratio of ew 1 and permeability kw 1 m s 2 2 boundary conditions and interface properties the nodal displacement at the vertical side of the mesh was constrained in the radial direction and fixed at the base fig 2 pore water flow was permitted across top frees surface but not across the side and base boundaries of the mesh flow across the external vertical sides or base of the mesh was not expected as the zones of excess pore pressure generation were confined close to the foundation remote from the external boundaries the top and bottom of the water element were fully bonded with the top plate and soil plug respectively the tangential behavior of the interface between the external and internal surface of the skirt and the soil was rough where the limit shaft friction was defined by the shear strength of the soil hard contact was used to model the normal behavior of the interface and no separation was permitted considering the pure vertical motion of the foundation finite sliding tracking approach was employed for the simulation where the large deformation between the skirts and the soil was involved the skirt tip of the bucket was fully boned with the soil and no water elements were included 2 3 soil parameters the critical state soil mechanics model in abaqus clay plasticity was used with model parameters to represent modified cam clay mcc roscoe and burland 1968 the implementation of mcc in abaqus uses a mises surface in the π plane and associated flow by defining the flow stress ratio as unity the numerical parameters used for the analysis are summarised in table 1 the soil was initially k0 consolidated with k0 1 sinϕ tc where ϕ tc is the friction angle for the triaxial compression conditions a uniform surcharge σvs 6 kpa was applied at the upper soil surface to provide a nominal non zero value of shear strength at the mudline the undrained shear strength profile was determined from the mcc input parameters using the expression proposed by potts and zdravkovic 1999 1 s u σ v 1 2 k 0 3 g θ c o s θ 1 a 2 2 1 κ λ with g θ s i n ϕ c s c o s θ 1 3 s i n ϕ c s s i n θ a 3 1 k 0 g 30 1 2 k 0 where θ is the lode s angle and ϕ c s the critical state angle of shearing resistance the value of θ is taken as 0 and 30 to present the shear strength under plane strain and triaxial compression condition respectively 2 4 analysis procedure after establishing the in situ stress conditions the bucket foundation was preloaded instantaneously to a proportion of the undrained vertical bearing capacity vu which is equivalent to the undrained tensile capacity to represent the self weight of the superstructure and the ballast allowing for generation of the excess pore pressure subsequently the preload was held constant and dissipation of the pore pressure was permitted the bucket foundation was then pulled out vertically to failure under displacement control with varying normalised velocities v 10 4 10 3 10 2 0 1 1 10 100 and 500 the normalised velocity was defined as 2 v v s c v w s c v t where v is the uplift velocity w is the vertical displacement t is the time for the action of the uplift load and s is the characteristic length of the drainage path expressed as mana et al 2014 3 s l m i n π 1 0 14 d l the coefficient of consolidation cv was calculated 4 c v k 1 e 0 σ v 0 λ γ w where k is the soil permeability λ is slope of the normally consolidated line in e ln p plane γw is the unit weight of the pore water e0 and σ v0 are the initial void ratio and in situ effective vertical stress 3 results 3 1 uplift capacities under undrained and drained conditions the variation of the uplift force ftot versus the foundation displacement is plotted as a function of the normalised uplift velocity v for l d 0 5 in fig 3 the uplift capacity presented in fig 3 converged to that for v 100 even though the adopted largest normalised velocity was 500 and no further reduction in the uplift capacity occurred when the value of v was below 10 3 fig 3 shows that the tensile capacity reduced from the upper limit for v 102 to the lower limit for 10 3 as the uplift velocity decreased three modes of failure were proposed by deng and carter 2002 corresponding to different drainage conditions as shown in fig 4 the development of the components including the suction force fwp i e the integration negative excess pore pressure across the base plate the external frictional force fext and internal frictional force fint are plotted in fig 5 together with the total uplift force as a function of the vertical displacement w for v 102 and 10 3 which bracket the foundation reaction under the fast loading rate the suction beneath the top plate has no sufficient time to dissipate fig 5a the contours of the foundation displacement relative to the soil for v 102 are presented in fig 6 a where the displacement of the whole soil plug is evident and the deformation of the water elements is hardly visible indicating that the detachment of top plate from the soil plug is prevented by the suction beneath the top plate the relative shear deformation of the soil localised at the external surface of the shaft implies that only the external frictional resistance is mobilised the total displacement vectors of the soil representing the failure mechanisms are shown in fig 6b for v 102 compared with fig 4a for the undrained uplift fig 3 indicates that no more additional capacity can be mobilised when the uplift velocity v 102 and fig 6 shows the reverse end bearing failure mechanism has been fully mobilised at v 102 therefore the undrained condition can be confirmed to be achieved by v 102 by contrast drained condition can be verified via negligible suction pressure during extraction fig 5b leading to the detachment of the top plate from the soil plug and the formation of a gap fig 4b significant expansion of the water elements indicates that the top plate separated from the soil plug under the action of pullout loading for v 10 3 in the absence of the suction fig 7 the vertical displacement vectors localised at the shaft indicate only shear failure occurs across the internal and external surface of the shaft fig 7 it is convinced by the fe results that the drained condition is achieved by an uplift velocity of v 10 3 under undrained condition the overall tensile capacity of the bucket foundations can be estimated from reverse end bearing capacity at the tip level and from the external friction along the shaft the uplift capacity of the foundation is given by 5 f u n c v s u 0 a α s u a v g a e x t where ncv is the end bearing capacity factor su0 is the undrained shear strength under triaxial extension at the tip level α is the shaft friction ratio i e the ratio of the mobilised shear stress to the undrained shear strength su avg is the average undrained shear strength over the shaft and aext is the external surface area of the shaft the fe results of the undrained tensile capacity for l d 0 5 were plotted in fig 5 together with the upper and lower bound limits for the compressive bearing capacity martin 2001 comparison of the fe results of the dimensionless uplift capacity fu asu0 are summarised in table 2 with the analytical solutions for other aspect ratios martin 2001 indicating nearly full reverse end bearing was achieved as observed in the centrifuge tests mana et al 2013 the fe results of the external friction show excellent agreement with the prediction of second part of equation 5 with α 1 and the calculated end bearing capacity factor was 8 6 for l d 0 5 compared with the ncv 9 suggested in api 2011 the values of ncv varied from 9 8 for l d 0 1 to 7 7 for l d 1 based on the fe results the soil resistance of the foundations under fully drained conditions is governed by shaft friction along the external and internal surface i e 6 f d a e x t a i n t τ d a v g where aint is the surface area of the internal face of the shaft and τd avg the average limit shear stress over the length of the shaft the derivation of τd avg is provided in appendix a the fe results of the shaft friction agree well the analytical value that derived from equation 6 fig 5b comparison of the fe results of the undrained and drained capacity with analytical solutions confirms the viability of the fe modelling 3 2 partially drained uplift capacity for bucket foundations for intermediate uplift velocity the suction can only partially dissipate and the soil failure generally occurs across the bottom of the bucket fig 4c unlike the undrained case where the contributions of the submerged weight of the soil plug and the overburden cancel out contributions to the pullout resistance for partially drained condition consist of the suction the submerged weight of the soil plug and the external friction the contribution of the submerged weight is reflected by mobilisation of the internal friction which ensures the equilibrium of the soil plug the variations of the suction developed at the top plate mobilised external and internal friction are shown in fig 8 for varying v respectively the magnitude of the suction decreased with decreasing uplift velocity indicating flow of the pore water from outside into the inside of the foundation fig 8a the mobilised internal shaft friction is linked to the relative shear deformation of the soil plug to the foundation increasing as the uplift velocity decreased and the suction dissipated fig 8c by contrast the available external shaft resistance increased as the normalised velocity reduced from v 102 to v 1 after which any decrease in the uplift velocity led to reduced external shaft resistance till the drained capacity was achieved the two distinct responses of the development of the external and internal friction were found by thieken et al 2014 however the results are explained here from two perspectives first the magnitude of the excess pore pressure por inside the soil plug and outside the skirt is shown in fig 9 for v 102 10 1 and 10 2 the suction developed within the soil plug cannot dissipate for v 102 fig 9a and a flow field had no time to form so that the negative excess pore pressure extended deeper into the soil below the skirt tip the zone close to the external shaft was not influenced under partially drained conditions a proportion of the suction within the plug dissipate outside of the skirts and the influenced zone along the external shaft increased with decreasing v fig 9b and c as v reduced further when the drained condition was achieved the suction dissipated mainly inside the skirts which is generally less than 1 kpa fig 9d the contour of the excess pore pressure reflected the extent and magnitude of increase in the effective stress and hence the external friction therefore the stress paths in the p q and e ln p plane for a representative soil element see fig 2 at the depth of 0 75 l are presented in fig 10 for different normalised velocities to look more insights into the variation of the external shaft friction for v 102 the void ratio e maintained at the initial value and the mobilised shear stress is equivalent to the in situ shear strength as the uplift velocity v reduced from 102 to 1 the suction can partially dissipate with the influenced zone extending towards outside of the skirts fig 9b and c leading to an increase in effective stress and volume contraction of the soil elements fig 10b and hence an increase in the shear strength fig 10a the stress path for v 1 shows the most significant increase in the mobilised shear strength however as the normalised uplift velocity decreased further and become less than 0 01 the time required for completion of the extraction was sufficient for inflow of the water into the element to compensate the volume expansion so that the generation of the negative excess pore pressure was negligible within the soil plug and in vicinity of the external skirts therefore the stress path for v 10 2 virtually followed the initial yield surface fig 10a the effective stress decreased as a result of the volume expansion of the soil elements therefore the mobilised external friction increased first to the maximum value as v reduced from 102 to 1 and then decreased until the drained condition was approached the variation of the uplift capacities with the normalised of velocity is presented in fig 11 as a function of the foundation aspect ratios the uplift capacity increases from the drained limit to the undrained limit with increasing uplift velocity for given foundation aspect ratio a unique response using equation 7 was proposed to describe the normalised uplift capacities for any given drainage condition as shown in fig 12 a 7 f f d f u f d 1 1 v v 50 1 09 where v50 is the normalised velocity at which the pullout resistance defines the average of the undrained and drained limits the values of v50 show a linear function of the foundation aspect ratio fig 12b 8 v 50 0 73 l d 0 037 ultimately the uplift capacity can be expressed explicitly as a function of the pullout velocity soil permeability and foundation geometry by substituting equations 2 3 and 8 into equation 7 giving 9 f f u f d 1 v d l d 0 14 c v 0 73 l d 0 037 1 09 f d 3 3 uplift capacity of the bucket foundations considering preloading the effect of the vertical preloading due to the self weight of the superstructure or the additional ballast is investigated in this section the excess pore pressure due to the preloading dissipates and the shear strength of the soil increases due to the soil consolidation fig 13 shows an example of the variation of uplift capacity for v 100 with increasing magnitude of vertical preload fp following the completion of the full primary consolidation for the aspect ratio of l d 0 5 the undrained and drained uplift capacities following the completion of the fully primary consolidation are shown in fig 14 a and b as a function of the vertical preloading fp fu the gain in the uplift capacity due to the consolidation linearly increases with increasing vertical preload the undrained and drained uplift capacities can be predicted using equation 10a and b respectively 10a f c u f u 1 1 0 47 l d f p f u 10b f c d f d 1 0 735 0 41 l d f p f u the gain in the undrained uplift capacity is dominant by the increase of the soil shear strength at the tip level whereas the increase in drained capacity is owing to the set up of the skirt friction therefore the gradient in equation 10 b is significantly smaller than equation 10 a the response of the variation of the uplift capacity considering the effect of preloading is plotted in fig 15 by taking advantage of the strategies for normalisation where the corresponding undrained and drained limits due to consolidation are adopted the responses for different magnitudes of preload are practically identical for given aspect ratio and consistent with the corresponding case when the preload is absent therefore the following equation with identical format of equation 9 can be used to describe the response of the capacity for given uplift velocity fc 11 f c f c d f c u f c d 1 1 v v 50 1 09 where the fcu and fcd are respectively the undrained and drained uplift capacity and v50 the normalised uplift velocity at which the normalised resistance is midway between fcu and fcd equation 8 3 4 design procedures an example application for a bucket foundation is presented in this section to demonstrate the procedure to estimate the uplift capacity using the results obtained from the numerical analyses the input parameters including the foundation geometry soil properties and the preload are summarised in table 3 assuming the excess pore pressure fully dissipates at the end of life of service of the foundation the following steps show the procedure to determine the capacity of the bucket foundation under uplift velocity of v 8 33 mm h the calculated results for the individual step below are presented in table 4 step 1 calculate the undrained and drained limits of the uplift capacity without preloading using equations 5 and 6 respectively step 2 estimate the length of the drainage path for given l d with equation 3 and calculate the normalised uplift velocity using equation 2 step 3 estimate v50 by equation 8 step 4 predict the undrained and drained uplift capacity considering the effect of preloading using equation 10a and b respectively step 5 determine the uplift capacity for given velocity using equation 11 4 conclusions the tensile capacity of bucket foundation in clay has been investigated through finite element analysis the effects of the foundation aspect ratio the rate of pullout relative to the soil permeability and the vertical preloading have been examined systematically aspects of the research outcome include the uplift capacity can be determined from the reverse end bearing capacity and the external shaft resistance drained capacity is ultimately achieved where the frictional resistance along external and internal surface governs the failure the undrained and drained tensile capacity following the completion of the primary consolidation increase linearly with increasing preloading an analytical solution is proposed for predicting the tensile capacity of bucket foundations with various different aspect ratios and under different drainage conditions finally a design

22148,the paper presents a hybrid method in frequency domain to predict the wave induced motions on ships advancing in waves a meshless cylinder surface in this solution is taken as the control surface by which the whole fluid domain is divided into the interior domain and exterior domain the velocity potential and its normal derivative on the meshless cylindrical control surface are expanded into laguerre fourier series the forward speed green function is adopted in the exterior domain the rankine green function is used in the interior domain and the cubic b spline technique is induced to compute the higher order derivatives of the velocity potential on the interior domain free surface the exterior domain and interior domain are connected by the continuous condition of fluid on the control surface the excellent level of agreement with the known semi analytical solutions and experimental measurements reveals that the present method is efficient and reliable to assess the seakeeping performance of ship with forward speed keywords hybrid method meshless cylindrical control surface laguerre fourier series cubic b spline ship motions forward speed 1 introduction ships advancing in waves with higher speed will experience larger amplitude motions and thus more serious wave loads which will threaten the safety of ship structure datta et al 2013 marónponce et al 2005 the influence of forward speed is critical and needs to be fully accounted for therefore prediction of wave induced motions of a ship with forward speed is important for the ship design a lot of researches on the potential flow theory has been carried out in the last couple of decades the principle methods can be classified in three basic types the rankine panel method sclavounos and nakos 1988 nakos 1990a 1990b 1991 1994 sclavounos et al 1994 sclavounos and ohkusu 1995 kring 1994 sclavounos 1995 making use of the rankine source function the free surface green function method chang 1977 kobayashi 2009 inglis and price 1982 guevel and bougis 1982 wu 1989 hoff 1990 jankowshi 1990 and the hybrid method combining the above mentioned two methods as the rankine source has a simple form of 1 r with r denoting the distance between the field point and the source point and suits for various of free surface boundary conditions the rankine panel method can be successfully applied to the seakeeping problems of ship with forward speed however large number of elements need to be distributed on the free surface which indicates the formidable numerical burdens and reduces the efficiency in addition as numerical beach technology is induced to prohibit the reflection of outgoing waves the results obtained by different numerical proceeding methods are always different the boundary element method associated with the free surface green function which is required to integrate over each discretized panel is conventional approach to solve the hydrodynamic problem this method works well in some particular cases like wave body interaction without forward speed unfortunately it fails to be generalized to the problem of the free surface flow induced by a ship advancing in waves the boundary integral can be reduced to an integral over the body surface and along the waterline as the forward speed green function satisfies the linear free surface boundary condition the source potential is singular and highly oscillatory when both field and source points are in the vicinity of the free surface chen and wu 2001 the difficulties associated with the numerical evaluations about the integrations of the forward speed green function over the waterline segments are a major stumbling block hindering the development of this method to circumvent the difficulties encountered in the above mentioned two methods and make full use of their advantages the hybrid method is proposed by zhang zhang et al 1998 for the first time the whole fluid domain is divided into exterior domain and interior domain by a control surface of which the form is arbitrary in the exterior domain which is defined from the control surface to the infinity the free surface green function is adopted without need to set the numerical beach in the interior domain where the floating body is present the rankine source is used only the part of free surface inside the control surface is needed to be divided which promotes the efficiency the exterior domain and interior domain are connected with the condition that the fluid is continuous across the control surface although the frequency domain method is of practical use for design unfortunately there are fewer studies of the hybrid method in frequency domain ten chen igor and chen 2010 have ever adopted a hemi sphere as the control surface and taken the legendre polynomials and fourier series as the elementary functions to express the potentials on the control surface analytically but it is realized that the integral of the green function on the hemi sphere control surface is difficult to be calculated the frequency domain hybrid method still has to be perfected as the implementation of the numerical method is enormously affected by the form of the control surface in this work the frequency domain hybrid method based on a meshless cylinder control surface is studied the computing process is simplified as the horizontal and vertical variables on the control surface are kept to be independent the velocity potential and its normal derivative on the analytical control surface are expressed in the form of fourier laguerre series and the relationship between them called dn which serves as the control surface boundary condition for solving the interior domain can be obtained by establishing the integral equations with the forward speed green function in the exterior domain the integration of the forward speed green function on the waterline of the control surface can be performed analytically and the numerical difficulties induced by the singularity and high oscillations are avoided meanwhile in the interior domain the cubic b spline technique is induced to give continuous representations of the velocity potential and its higher order derivatives on the free surface from which the unknowns in the linear free surface boundary condition are translated into the control point of the cubic b spline the integral equations are established in the interior domain with application of rankine source based on the second green s identity finally the velocity potentials of the fluid domain are solved with boundary conditions of the interior domain and the relationship dn actually much advance work has been done and zero speed hydrodynamic problems have been solved with current method successfully li et al 2016a whereby the hybrid method is further applied to predict the motions of the ship with forward speed in this study the validation is made through comparisons with the semi analytical solution of a submerged sphere and the experimental measurements on wigley ⅲ hull 2 statement of the mathematical problem to investigate the wave field around a freely floating vessel which advances through waves two different frames of reference are defined as illustrated in fig 1 the cartesian coordinate system x x y z is fixed in space with the positive x axis pointing downstream and z axis downwards in this frame the vessel oscillates about its mean position while translating at a constant forward speed u the right handed coordinate system x x y z moves with the vessel at the same speed x axis points in the direction of forward speed and z points vertically downwards x y plane coincides with the undisturbed free surface the origin of the coordinates is located right above the center of gravity in the frame x the physical problem may be alternatively considered as a vessel undergoing an oscillatory motion in the presence of an uniform incoming flow of velocity u in the direction of the negative x axis β denotes the heading angle and β 0 indicates the following sea under the assumptions of inviscid and incompressible fluid and irrotational flow the theory of velocity potential is developed to investigate the fluid region ω surrounding the ship in the frame x the total velocity potential φ x y z t can be decomposed into the steady potential ϕ x y z due to unit forward speed and time periodic unsteady potential ϕ x y z 1 φ x y z t u x u ϕ x y z re ϕ x y z e i ω t among them both ϕ and ϕ satisfy the laplace equation in the whole fluid domain ω and an appropriate radiation

ϕ n n 1 on the mean body surface s 0 where the normal vector on s 0 points inwards the body surface and n 1 is its component in the x direction and 4 ϕ 0 on the bottom s b of infinite depth the time periodic unsteady potential can be further written as 5 ϕ j 1 6 η j ϕ j a 0 ϕ 0 ϕ 7 in which ϕ j j 1 6 is the radiation potentials induced by the six degrees of free oscillations of the body and η j j 1 6 are the corresponding motion amplitudes including phases ϕ 0 and ϕ 7 are the potentials of incident and diffracted waves respectively a 0 a 7 is the incoming wave amplitude for an incoming wave at a frequency ω 0 the incident potential ϕ 0 can be expressed as 6 ϕ 0 i g ω 0 e ν 0 z i x cos β y sin β where ν 0 ω 0 2 g is the wavenumber the components of the radiation and diffraction potentials

ship with forward speed as shown in fig 2 the whole fluid field surrounding the vessel is divided into exterior domain and interior domain in which the free surface green function and rankine source are adopted respectively the arrows in fig 2 which point towards fluid in the exterior domain and outwards interior domain indicate the normal vector on the boundary consisted of the body surface s 0 mean free surface s f and control surface s c 3 1 the series expansion method of velocity potential to implement the calculation conveniently a cylindrical coordinate system ρ φ z is further defined and the origin is fixed at the same position with that of the frame x these two systems have the following relationship 14 x y z ρ cos φ ρ sin φ z the velocity potential ϕ φ z on the control surface is the function of the circumferential and vertical variables and can be expanded into fourier laguerre series as 15 ϕ φ z m n 0 ϕ n m ℓ n z e i m φ where l n z is n th order laguerre polynomial ℓ n z l n z e z 2 is the n th order laguerre function ϕ n m is coefficient of the series expansion and can be solved by orthogonal properties of laguerre function and fourier series 16 ϕ n m 1 2 π 0 π π ϕ φ

f 2 f f k cos θ and f u g l f ω l g l denotes the reference length we should realize that the expression of g f involves x ξ η y and z ζ instead of x ξ y η and z ζ as usual this difference is due to the positive z axis pointing downwards instead of upwards as is most often done in the literature the forward speed green function satisfies the linear free surface boundary condition 22 g n g ζ 1 g ω

method to compute the forward speed green function in cylindrical coordinate system is proposed in li et al 2018 unlike classical formulations based on the integration in wave number first the integration in circumference variable is performed analytically by using the theorem of residues the resultant expression in single wavenumber integral is well suited for its integration on the

this study and the unknowns in the free surface condition of the interior domain are translated into the control points of cubic b spline when the source point and field point are both on the free surface the singularity of the integrand can be removed by subtracting a singular term which can be evaluated analytically the relative work will be introduced here briefly as the details have been published in li et al 2016b the free surface p u v can be expressed by the cubic b spline as 34 p u v j 0 t i 0 s d i j n i k u n j k v where u v is the parameter point which can be parameterized from

validate the correctness of the hybrid method a submerged sphere and wigley ⅲ hull are taken for examples the numerical results are compared with the semi analytical results and experimental measurements respectively 4 1 submerged sphere a submerged sphere is studied in this paper and the calculation model is depicted in fig 3 the depth of the submergence h is twice the radius of the sphere a 1 0 and the radius of the control surface is defined as ρ 0 1 5 there are 200 panels on the sphere and 1225 panels corresponding to the parameters of b spline s 36 t 36 on the free surface the added mass μ i j and damping coefficients λ i j for a froude number f n u g a 0 4 are evaluated by the hybrid method with the fourier laguerre expansion consisting of 11 terms of laguerre function m 0 10 and 21 terms of fourier series n 10 10 the numerical results are compared with the semi analytical results given by wu wu and taylor 1988 and shown in figs 4 6 the abscissae are the non dimensionalized wavenumber ν 0 a the solutions are non dimensionalized as a i j μ i j ρ w v and b i j 2 λ i j ω ρ w v where v denotes the volume of the body from figs 4 6 we can see the present calculation agrees very well with wu s results this reveals that the hybrid method is efficient to solve the easier hydrodynamic problems of a submerged body and makes the results more reliable when predicting the motions of the ship piercing the free surface 4 2 wigley ⅲ hull wigley ⅲ hull is further calculated in this study the non dimensional hull shape is defined in the coordinate system x

provides the dimensional hull model the center of gravity x g y g z g locates at the origin o 0 0 0 and the radius of inertia for pitch is defined as r yy 0 75 the calculation model for wigley ⅲ is illustrated in fig 7 the body and the free surface are divided into 200 and 1500 elements the corresponding parameters of b spline on the free surface are s 102 and t 17 the radius of the control surface ρ 0 is 200 m taking the efficiency and accuracy into account simultaneously the terms of laguerre function and fourier series up to n 10 n n n and m 40 m m m have been retained respectively

software co developed by harbin engineering university and ccs for predicting the motions and wave induced loads with zero speed green function and the encounter frequency method when solving the forward speed problem the numerical results of hydrodynamic coefficients are in better agreement with the experimental measurements than those calculated by walcs with encounter frequency method especially for the damping coefficients b 33 and b 55 the exciting forces are further presented in figs 12 and 13 again the numerical and experimental results are very close to each other this reveals that the exciting forces have been evaluated exactly then the motions can be predicted from figs 14 and 15 we can see that the amplitude of motion in heave predicted by walcs with the traditional encounter frequency method is much larger than the experiments and the frequency where the maximum of amplitude of pitch motion occurs is also larger fortunately the numerical results obtained by the present hybrid method indicate a good agreement with the experimental measurements in addition the motions at f n 0 are further evaluated and presented in figs 16 and 17 compared with the case of f n 0 3 the influence of forward speed is obvious the higher speed induces larger amplitude motions this reveals the great meaning to devise a robust method adequately accounting for forward speed effects 5 conclusion in this paper the hybrid method with a meshless cylinder control surface is proposed to predict the motions of the ship with forward speed the conclusion can be drawn as follows 1 in the exterior domain the integration of the forward speed green function on the waterline of the control surface shown in 28 and 29 can be performed analytically the numerical difficulties induced by the singularity and high oscillations are avoided 2 the relationship dn between the velocity potential and its normal derivatives on the control surface just relates to the forward speed u and encounter frequency ω the identical dn matrix can be applied to different vessels this is one benefit over the other methods 3 in the interior domain the coefficients defined by 49 52 and 55 is connected with ship hull and only need to be calculated one time for different cases of speed u and frequency ω the calculated amount is reduced and the efficiency is thus promoted 4 cubic b spline technology is applied to express the velocity potential as well as its first and second derivatives about x on the free surface successfully the unknowns in the free surface boundary condition are transformed into the control points which are further evaluated with the galerkin method in the integral equation 5 the numerical results show that the hybrid method with a meshless cylinder control surface in this paper is practical and reliable this work not only provides an efficient way but also broadens the thought to evaluate the hydrodynamic problem with forward speed the hybrid method in this paper is appropriate for predicting the motion of the displacement ship as the linear free surface boundary condition 7 is adopted while greater efforts should be made in the future to perfect the present study as which is in its primary stage firstly more validations are needed especially for hulls of more complex form and the numerical results are expected to be more stable secondly the steady potential shall be taken into account in the free surface boundary condition when solving the radiation and diffraction potentials last but not least as the rankine source is adopted in the interior domain the present method can be developed to account for nonlinear and viscous effects author contribution statement hui li visualization supervision writing reviewing and editing lizhu hao data

22148,the paper presents a hybrid method in frequency domain to predict the wave induced motions on ships advancing in waves a meshless cylinder surface in this solution is taken as the control surface by which the whole fluid domain is divided into the interior domain and exterior domain the velocity potential and its normal derivative on the meshless cylindrical control surface are expanded into laguerre fourier series the forward speed green function is adopted in the exterior domain the rankine green function is used in the interior domain and the cubic b spline technique is induced to compute the higher order derivatives of the velocity potential on the interior domain free surface the exterior domain and interior domain are connected by the continuous condition of fluid on the control surface the excellent level of agreement with the known semi analytical solutions and experimental measurements reveals that the present method is efficient and reliable to assess the seakeeping performance of ship with forward speed keywords hybrid method meshless cylindrical control surface laguerre fourier series cubic b spline ship motions forward speed 1 introduction ships advancing in waves with higher speed will experience larger amplitude motions and thus more serious wave loads which will threaten the safety of ship structure datta et al 2013 marónponce et al 2005 the influence of forward speed is critical and needs to be fully accounted for therefore prediction of wave induced motions of a ship with forward speed is important for the ship design a lot of researches on the potential flow theory has been carried out in the last couple of decades the principle methods can be classified in three basic types the rankine panel method sclavounos and nakos 1988 nakos 1990a 1990b 1991 1994 sclavounos et al 1994 sclavounos and ohkusu 1995 kring 1994 sclavounos 1995 making use of the rankine source function the free surface green function method chang 1977 kobayashi 2009 inglis and price 1982 guevel and bougis 1982 wu 1989 hoff 1990 jankowshi 1990 and the hybrid method combining the above mentioned two methods as the rankine source has a simple form of 1 r with r denoting the distance between the field point and the source point and suits for various of free surface boundary conditions the rankine panel method can be successfully applied to the seakeeping problems of ship with forward speed however large number of elements need to be distributed on the free surface which indicates the formidable numerical burdens and reduces the efficiency in addition as numerical beach technology is induced to prohibit the reflection of outgoing waves the results obtained by different numerical proceeding methods are always different the boundary element method associated with the free surface green function which is required to integrate over each discretized panel is conventional approach to solve the hydrodynamic problem this method works well in some particular cases like wave body interaction without forward speed unfortunately it fails to be generalized to the problem of the free surface flow induced by a ship advancing in waves the boundary integral can be reduced to an integral over the body surface and along the waterline as the forward speed green function satisfies the linear free surface boundary condition the source potential is singular and highly oscillatory when both field and source points are in the vicinity of the free surface chen and wu 2001 the difficulties associated with the numerical evaluations about the integrations of the forward speed green function over the waterline segments are a major stumbling block hindering the development of this method to circumvent the difficulties encountered in the above mentioned two methods and make full use of their advantages the hybrid method is proposed by zhang zhang et al 1998 for the first time the whole fluid domain is divided into exterior domain and interior domain by a control surface of which the form is arbitrary in the exterior domain which is defined from the control surface to the infinity the free surface green function is adopted without need to set the numerical beach in the interior domain where the floating body is present the rankine source is used only the part of free surface inside the control surface is needed to be divided which promotes the efficiency the exterior domain and interior domain are connected with the condition that the fluid is continuous across the control surface although the frequency domain method is of practical use for design unfortunately there are fewer studies of the hybrid method in frequency domain ten chen igor and chen 2010 have ever adopted a hemi sphere as the control surface and taken the legendre polynomials and fourier series as the elementary functions to express the potentials on the control surface analytically but it is realized that the integral of the green function on the hemi sphere control surface is difficult to be calculated the frequency domain hybrid method still has to be perfected as the implementation of the numerical method is enormously affected by the form of the control surface in this work the frequency domain hybrid method based on a meshless cylinder control surface is studied the computing process is simplified as the horizontal and vertical variables on the control surface are kept to be independent the velocity potential and its normal derivative on the analytical control surface are expressed in the form of fourier laguerre series and the relationship between them called dn which serves as the control surface boundary condition for solving the interior domain can be obtained by establishing the integral equations with the forward speed green function in the exterior domain the integration of the forward speed green function on the waterline of the control surface can be performed analytically and the numerical difficulties induced by the singularity and high oscillations are avoided meanwhile in the interior domain the cubic b spline technique is induced to give continuous representations of the velocity potential and its higher order derivatives on the free surface from which the unknowns in the linear free surface boundary condition are translated into the control point of the cubic b spline the integral equations are established in the interior domain with application of rankine source based on the second green s identity finally the velocity potentials of the fluid domain are solved with boundary conditions of the interior domain and the relationship dn actually much advance work has been done and zero speed hydrodynamic problems have been solved with current method successfully li et al 2016a whereby the hybrid method is further applied to predict the motions of the ship with forward speed in this study the validation is made through comparisons with the semi analytical solution of a submerged sphere and the experimental measurements on wigley ⅲ hull 2 statement of the mathematical problem to investigate the wave field around a freely floating vessel which advances through waves two different frames of reference are defined as illustrated in fig 1 the cartesian coordinate system x x y z is fixed in space with the positive x axis pointing downstream and z axis downwards in this frame the vessel oscillates about its mean position while translating at a constant forward speed u the right handed coordinate system x x y z moves with the vessel at the same speed x axis points in the direction of forward speed and z points vertically downwards x y plane coincides with the undisturbed free surface the origin of the coordinates is located right above the center of gravity in the frame x the physical problem may be alternatively considered as a vessel undergoing an oscillatory motion in the presence of an uniform incoming flow of velocity u in the direction of the negative x axis β denotes the heading angle and β 0 indicates the following sea under the assumptions of inviscid and incompressible fluid and irrotational flow the theory of velocity potential is developed to investigate the fluid region ω surrounding the ship in the frame x the total velocity potential φ x y z t can be decomposed into the steady potential ϕ x y z due to unit forward speed and time periodic unsteady potential ϕ x y z 1 φ x y z t u x u ϕ x y z re ϕ x y z e i ω t among them both ϕ and ϕ satisfy the laplace equation in the whole fluid domain ω and an appropriate radiation condition at infinity based on the linear hydrodynamic theory the steady potential satisfies 2 u 2 g 2 x 2 ϕ z ϕ 0 on the undisturbed free surface s f z 0 where g is the acceleration due to gravity 3 ϕ n n 1 on the mean body surface s 0 where the normal vector on s 0 points inwards the body surface and n 1 is its component in the x direction and 4 ϕ 0 on the bottom s b of infinite depth the time periodic unsteady potential can be further written as 5 ϕ j 1 6 η j ϕ j a 0 ϕ 0 ϕ 7 in which ϕ j j 1 6 is the radiation potentials induced by the six degrees of free oscillations of the body and η j j

mean free surface s f and control surface s c 3 1 the series expansion method of velocity potential to implement the calculation conveniently a cylindrical coordinate system ρ φ z is further defined and the origin is fixed at the same position with that of the frame x these two systems have the following relationship 14 x y z ρ cos φ ρ sin φ z the velocity potential ϕ φ z on the control surface is the function of the circumferential and vertical variables and can be expanded into fourier laguerre series as 15 ϕ φ z m n 0 ϕ n m ℓ n z e i m φ where l n z is n th order laguerre polynomial ℓ n z l n z e z 2 is the n th order laguerre function ϕ n m is coefficient of the series expansion and can be solved by orthogonal properties of laguerre function and fourier series 16 ϕ n m 1 2 π 0 π π ϕ φ

f 2 f f k cos θ and f u g l f ω l g l denotes the reference length we should realize that the expression of g f involves x ξ η y and z ζ instead of x ξ y η and z ζ as usual this difference is due to the positive z axis pointing downwards instead of upwards as is most often done in the literature the forward speed green function satisfies the linear free surface boundary condition 22 g n g ζ 1 g ω

this study and the unknowns in the free surface condition of the interior domain are translated into the control points of cubic b spline when the source point and field point are both on the free

sphere a 1 0 and the radius of the control surface is defined as ρ 0 1 5 there are 200 panels on the sphere and 1225 panels corresponding to the parameters of b spline s 36 t 36 on the free surface the added mass μ i j and damping coefficients λ i j for a froude number f n u g a 0 4 are evaluated by the hybrid method with the fourier laguerre expansion consisting of 11 terms of laguerre function m 0 10 and 21 terms of fourier series n 10 10 the numerical results are compared with the semi analytical results given by wu wu and taylor 1988 and shown in figs 4 6 the abscissae are the non dimensionalized wavenumber ν 0 a the solutions are non dimensionalized as a i j μ i j ρ w v and b i j 2 λ i j ω ρ w v where v denotes the volume of the body from figs 4 6 we can see the present calculation agrees very well with wu s results this reveals that the hybrid method is efficient to solve the easier hydrodynamic problems of a submerged body and makes the results more reliable when predicting the motions of the ship piercing the free surface 4 2 wigley ⅲ hull wigley ⅲ hull is further calculated in this study the non dimensional hull shape is defined in the coordinate system x

software co developed by harbin engineering university and ccs for predicting the motions and wave induced loads with zero speed green function and the encounter frequency method when solving the forward speed problem the numerical results of hydrodynamic coefficients are in better agreement with the experimental measurements than those calculated by walcs with encounter frequency method especially for the damping coefficients b 33 and b 55 the exciting forces are further presented in figs 12 and 13 again the numerical and experimental results are very close to each other this reveals that the exciting forces have been evaluated exactly then the motions can be predicted from figs 14 and 15 we can see that the amplitude of motion in heave predicted by walcs with the traditional encounter frequency method is much larger than the experiments and the frequency where the maximum of amplitude of pitch motion occurs is also larger fortunately the numerical results obtained by the present hybrid method indicate a good agreement with the experimental measurements in addition the motions at f n 0 are further evaluated and presented in figs 16 and 17 compared with the case of f n 0 3 the influence of forward speed is obvious the higher speed induces larger amplitude motions this reveals the great meaning to devise a robust method adequately accounting for forward speed effects 5 conclusion in this paper the hybrid method with a meshless cylinder control surface is proposed to predict the motions of the ship with forward speed the conclusion can be drawn as follows 1 in the exterior domain the integration of the forward speed green function on the waterline of the control surface shown in 28 and 29 can be performed analytically the numerical difficulties induced by the singularity and high oscillations are avoided 2 the relationship dn between the velocity potential and its normal derivatives on the control surface just relates to the forward speed u and encounter frequency ω the identical dn matrix can be applied to different vessels this is one benefit over the other methods 3 in the interior domain the coefficients defined by 49 52 and 55 is connected with ship hull and only need to be calculated one time for different cases of speed u and frequency ω the calculated amount is reduced and the efficiency is thus promoted 4 cubic b spline technology is applied to express the velocity potential as well as its first and second derivatives about x on the free surface successfully the unknowns in the free surface boundary condition are transformed into the control points which are further evaluated with the galerkin method in the integral equation 5 the numerical results show that the hybrid method with a meshless cylinder control surface in this paper is practical and reliable this work not only provides an efficient way but also broadens the thought to evaluate the hydrodynamic problem with forward speed the hybrid method in this paper is appropriate for predicting the motion of the displacement ship as the linear free surface boundary condition 7 is adopted while greater efforts should be made in the future to perfect the present study as which is in its primary stage firstly more validations are needed especially for hulls of more complex form and the numerical results are expected to be more stable secondly the steady potential shall be taken into account in the free surface boundary condition when solving the radiation and diffraction potentials last but not least as the rankine source is adopted in the interior domain the present method can be developed to account for nonlinear and viscous effects author contribution statement hui li visualization supervision writing reviewing and editing lizhu hao data

start from the steady state of self propulsion then different types of stopping maneuver is carried out by controlling the propeller and rudder in addition deep and shallow water conditions are both computed to illustrate the water depth effect on the stopping performance the predicted trajectory and ship speed of different stopping maneuvers are presented and analyzed detail information of flow visualizations including pressure distribution and wake flow during stopping maneuver are discussed to explain the stopping behavior it is concluded that the turning circle maneuver is the most preferable way to avoid the collision in open sea however if the ship needs to stop in port or waterways then the reversing propeller rp is better due to the fact that it meets the relatively shorter lateral deviation keywords ship stopping maneuver overset grid method reversing propeller cfd simulation 1 introduction in recent years cargo ships such as container ship bulk carrier tend to become larger to reduce the cost of shipping and thus improve transport efficiency however a larger size of ship will worsen the maneuverability and accidents can easily occur in the crowded ports or channels therefore it is of great importance to study the stopping ability of large ships to prevent the ship from collision and to ensure the safety of a ship sailing near the port especially in shallow water since the operation on propeller and rudder changes the course of ship the trajectory of stopping maneuver is not a straight line as shown in fig 1 good stopping ability means minimum stopping distance also known as track reach horizontal distance or lateral distance and yaw angle generally reversing propeller is the most common operation when a large ship needs to brake to prevent collision in the procedure of stopping maneuver the bow will turn port or starboard side because of the side forces at the aft caused by the reversing propeller the existence of the lateral force caused by reversing propeller is found by chislett and smitt 1972 through ship model test apart from the reversing propeller approach several other operations on propeller and rudder such as turning rudder while reversing propeller turning rudder while stopping the engine also have some influences on the stopping ability when the obstacle is in the open sea turning circle maneuver can also be a preferable way to avoid the collision while in the meantime reduce the load of engine the stopping ability is a key standard to examine the ship performance traditionally empirical formula method and experimental method are used to evaluate the stopping ability of ships the requirements of an actual ship stopping experiment with free running facility are very difficult to achieve and the test cost is very high therefore estimation of ship stopping ability through numerical simulation is preferred at present numerical study of ship stopping maneuver still relies on captive model test at first mathematical model is established and the related hydrodynamic derivatives are separated then the ship hydrodynamic is predicted through either experiments or numerical simulations at last the ship maneuvering motion is calculated from the obtained parameters two kinds of mathematical model i e abkowitz model abkowitz 1980 and mmg model yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 were proposed to describe the maneuvering motion equations with different aspects of the way of the forces acting on the ship propeller and rudder and their interaction this approach has been widely used in the prediction of ship stopping ability crane 1967 used a non linear mathematical model with experimentally determined coefficients approach to do computations of stopping maneuvers it was concluded that the merits of various methods for improving stopping performance depend largely on ship speed of approach hooft 1970 presented the results of model experiments on a series 60 model regarding the governing factors in respect of the controllability during the stopping maneuver and gave a quasi stationary solution of the equations of motion in the horizontal plane dong et al 1996 used a mathematical model to compute ship motion in crash stopping and proposed a new method to deal with hydrodynamic forces and moments of propeller based on the principle of ship propulsion and maneuverability good agreements were achieved by comparing with sea trials and experiments lu 2007 conducted simulations of ship stopping motion by reverse propulsion where the stopping maneuver was calculated based on mmg model yabuki et al 2006 conducted experimental and numerical studies that aimed at investigating the characteristics of the stopping motion of a ship with a single controllable pitch propeller cpp and single rudder they used the mathematical model and considered the wind force ueno et al 2017 carried out numerical predictions for stopping maneuver of model scale kvlcc1 ship and proposed a j and speed correction jsc method to give predictions of full scale ship performance the stopping maneuver is simulated based on a three degree of freedom mathematical model free running model tests on ship stopping maneuver were also performed and compared with the numerical results although the most previous researches of stopping maneuver using mathematical model are convenient they cannot analyze the detailed interaction between the propeller and the ship among several approaches to predict ship maneuverability numerical simulation of free running ship with actual rotating propellers and turning rudders is the most reliant way to predict the complex flow interactions during ship maneuvering motion so far dynamic overset grid technique has been successfully applied to solve the problem of large amplitude ship motions and complex motion of ship hull propeller rudder interaction carrica et al 2012 performed the simulations of turn and zigzag maneuver using a self developed solver cfdship iowa and the operation of rudders were achieved by the dynamic overset grid technique while the rotating propellers were using body force model mofidi and carrica 2014 further extended their work by using the direct simulation of free running zigzag maneuver of kcs ship model where ship maneuver with actual rotating propeller and turning rudder were computed in calm water the results were promising when compared with the experiment although the authors emphasized that the computational cost in direct calculating free running ships was still very high after that carrica et al 2016 further investigated the direct simulation of zigzag maneuver of kcs ship model in shallow water recently dubbioso et al 2017 and muscari et al 2017 conducted cfd investigations of hydrodynamic loads on propellers in steady and transient maneuvers using overset grid approach shen et al 2015 implemented the dynamic overset grid module to the open source cfd software openfoam and presented some applications to the ship maneuvering motions wang et al 2017 2018 used the same approach to simulate the free running ship with applications to self propulsion zigzag maneuver turning circle maneuver in both calm water and waves which showed that the dynamic overset grid approach is a suitable and reliable way to predict strong interactions between ship hull propeller and rudder in the present paper the author uses the self developed naoe foam sjtu solver wang et al 2019a based on overset grid technique to directly simulate the ship stopping maneuver with rotating propellers and turning rudders the main purpose of this study is to propose an accurate way to predict the performance of ship stopping maneuver based on viscous flow computations actually this study not only considers the standard stopping maneuver also known as the full astern stopping maneuver but also carries out other types of maneuvers with the purpose of investigating the different ship performance through the operation on propeller and rudder main parameters of stopping maneuver such as the stopping distance the lateral distance are presented and compared with the available experiment detailed analysis and comparison of the pressure distribution and the wake flow around the ship are also presented the paper is organized as follows numerical methods including the naoe foam sjtu solver and numerical schemes are illustrated then the geometry model computational grid are presented self propulsion simulation is discussed firstly and then the detailed simulations of different types of maneuvers i e reversing propeller no propeller case inertia stop case turning circle are described subsequently finally a brief conclusion is drawn 2 numerical methods in the present study numerical simulations for ship stopping maneuvers are performed with the ship hydrodynamics cfd solver naoe foam sjtu which is developed on the open source platform openfoam and has the overset grid capability the solver includes a full 6dof motion module with a hierarchy of bodies therefore it is very convenient to achieve the numerical computations of free running ship based on the dynamic overset grid module and the 6dof motion with moving component different kinds of ship maneuvers can be simulated so far the present solver has the ability of simulating ship self propulsion zigzag maneuver turning circle maneuver and course keeping maneuver based on the control of movement of propeller and rudder fig 2 illustrates the diagram of the 6dof motion module in naoe foam sjtu solver the original modules in openfoam such as rans vof and turbulence models are marked with blue color these modules are further modified for sparse matrix solvers to excluded non active cells when using dynamic overset grid the stopping maneuver in the present study is simulated incorporating with the reversing propeller marked in red color module as we know it is rather difficult to reappear the actual operations in test case using cfd computations furthermore the present work mainly focuses on the integral values of stopping maneuver such as trajectory and velocity which are more or less dominated by the effects after the full astern execution considering the above aspects here we adopt the constant deacceleration approach to achieve the reversing control of the propeller the control mechanism of reversing propeller is by deaccelerate the rotational speed of propeller through 1 r r p r 0 k t t t p r 0 t t p where r r p is the rotational speed of reversing propeller r 0 is the original speed according to the corresponding ship speed k is the propeller accelerating rate here we use constant value 5 18r s2 and t p is the time when the rotational speed achieves the target value in addition turning circle maneuver is also used when considering the rudder reflection for the flow field calculation the present naoe foam sjtu solves the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations for unsteady turbulent flows around the advancing ship a volume of fluid vof approach with bounded compression technique is used berberović et al 2009 to capture the free surface the turbulence features are modeled by a blended k ω k ε shear stress transport sst turbulence model menter et al 2003 the velocity gradient near the wall is resolved by the wall function treatment up to now the naoe foam sjtu solver has been extensively validated various ship hydrodynamic cases e g ship resistance zha et al 2014 2015 seakeeping shen and wan 2013 2016 shen et al 2014 propulsion and maneuvering shen et al 2015 wang et al 2017 2018 2019b wang and wan 2018 the finite volume method fvm with unstructured grids is used to transform the governing equations from the physical space into the computational space the solution of the coupling velocity and pressure equations is obtained by using the pressure implicit with splitting of operator piso algorithm issa 1986 built in numerical schemes provided by openfoam are used to discretize the pdes and supported solvers are employed to solve the linear system of equations 3 geometry model and grid 3 1 geometry model the benchmark ship model kvlcc1 is used for the numerical simulations of ship stopping maneuver kvlcc1 is a single screw ship and it has been used as one of the benchmark models for cfd computation in previous 2008 simman workshop the geometric model is shown in fig 3 and main particulars of the ship model are listed in table 1 3 2 computational grid and boundary conditions the computational domain is divided into three parts the background grid the grid around the hull and the grid around propeller the unstructured grids are generated by the tool snappyhexmesh with the background grid generated by blockmesh as mentioned in the introduction part there are several computational grids used in the present work with consideration of different simulation conditions fig 4 shows the computational domain and overset grid arrangement in deep water and shallow water respectively in the present simulations the background domain extends to 1 5l x 3 0l 1 5l y 1 5l 1 0l z 0 5l and the range of hull domain is 0 15l x 1 2l 0 15l y 0 15l 0 2l z 0 2l for the shallow water case the range of z axis is the same with the corresponding water depth the grid spacing near wall is designed to meet the requirements using wall functions with y is around 30 the total grid number is 4 58 million and 4 35 million for the deep and shallow water case respectively the boundary conditions are shown in fig 4a the coordinate system and the definition of axis have also been shown in fig 4a the ship is moving forward instead of using inlet velocity thus the upstream boundary condition imposes zero velocity and zero gradient of pressure boundary conditions at downstream are identical with pressure outlet condition for the deep water case the bottom boundary condition imposes farfield condition while non slip boundary condition is applied for the bottom in shallow water case the grid size in the upstream and downstream is relatively coarse with the consideration of avoid reflection of ship waves by numerical dissipation 4 numerical simulations and discussions in the present work the self propulsion case is conducted firstly to validate the present cfd solver in predicting the hydrodynamic performance of free running kvlcc1 ship model with rotating propeller for the stopping maneuver using reversing propeller three conditions are considered no rudder port rudder and starboard rudder for the no propeller case inertia stop case port rudder and starboard rudder are carried out in the end a turning circle maneuver is also simulated to estimate the advance for the turning rudder cases the turning rate is the maximum rudder rate 24 5 deg s all the numerical simulations are conducted on the hpc cluster center in computational marine hydrodynamics lab cmhl shanghai jiao tong university each node consists of 2 cpus with 20 cores per node and 64 gb accessible memory intel xeon e5 2680v2 2 8 ghz 40 processors are assigned for each computation the time step is used to satisfy the requirement of the propeller rotation angle in each time step is no larger than 1 thus the time step is set relatively small with a value of 5 10 4 s and the corresponding courant number is about 0 15 in all the present simulations 4 1 self propulsion according to the free running kvlcc1 ship model experiments tsukada et al 2015 performed at national maritime research institute nmri basin the ship model is advancing in calm water with ship speed of 0 76 m s corresponding to the full scale ship 15 5kn the ship model is free to trim and sink during the simulation the ship speed is an input and a pi controller shen et al 2015 is used to control the rotational speed of propeller to achieve the equivalent between propeller thrust and the ship resistance at the corresponding target ship speed the self propulsion simulation starts from the steady state of the towing condition which means that the initial flow field for the self propulsion case is mapped from the steady flow of bare hull with corresponding ship speed fig 5 shows the time histories of the calculated rotational speed of propeller and the ship model speed under self propulsion condition the predicted results are also compared with the experimental data tsukada et al 2015 it can be seen that the predicted rotational speed of propeller is 17 02 r s when the ship reaches the target speed the calculated result is under predicted by 1 05 compared with the experimental data 17 2 r s from the time history of the instantaneous ship speed we can see that the ship speed firstly drops down due to the lower thrust provided by the propeller and the speed increases as the propeller rate speeds up and finally reaches the target ship speed it is proved that the numerical approach used in this paper can accurately predict the self propulsion performance of the kvlcc1 ship model which lays a good foundation for the simulations of stopping maneuver 4 2 reversing propeller generally reversing the propeller is the most common operation when a large ship needs to brake to prevent collision it is also known as the full astern stopping the simulation conditions are following the setup of experiments performed at nmri ueno et al 2017 where the model scale stopping maneuver starts with a speed of 0 4905 m s 10kn in full scale therefore a self propulsion simulation at this speed is firstly conducted and the predicted propeller rate of revolution is 10 52 r s since there is no available propeller rate data for this ship speed thus the full astern propeller rate of revolution 10 36 r s from the experiment ueno et al 2017 is used in the simulation of stopping maneuver the numerical computation of stopping maneuver starts from the steady state of self propulsion then the propeller is controlled to a reverse speed of 10 36 r s to carry out the crash astern stopping maneuver the authors who conducted the stopping maneuver experiments exclude the discussion of the duration time and we cannot do the exactly same control during the simulation the present simulations adopted the control mechanism as shown in eqn 1 to deaccelerate the propeller rate three degrees of freedom on the horizontal plane i e surge sway and yaw are released for the numerical simulations of reversing propeller and three conditions are simulated regarding to the rudder i e without rudder port rudder and starboard rudder the case of crash astern case without rudder turning is followed the experimental procedure and has been compared with the available data in this case and cases shown later the non dimensional parameters are used to identify the ship motion and trajectory the track reach and lateral distance are expressed as x l y l respectively non dimensional ship speed and time are defined as v v g l t t l g where l is the ship length and g is the acceleration of gravity the track reach and the lateral distance is calculated from the beginning point when the ship executes full astern to the end point when the ship speed is equals zero fig 6 shows the trajectory and ship speed comparisons between calculated results and the experimental data from nmri ueno et al 2017 because the x axis is point to the ship stern and the ship is advancing in the negative axis in the present paper the figure is mirrored in x axis it can be seen from the trajectory that the track reach and the lateral distance agree well with the experimental data the end point for simulation result is 3 90 0 673 is very close to the experimental measurement 4 02 0 703 the cfd result of stopping track is underestimated by 2 98 and the cfd result of lateral distance is 4 27 smaller than the experiment the predicted ship speed as shown in fig 6b matches well with the experiment for the time to complete stopping maneuver while some discrepancies are observed for the ship speed during the stopping process the predicted ship speed is smaller than that of the experimental data during the process which lead to the shorter travelled distance shown in fig 6a the overall agreement for the present simulation for the stopping maneuver indicates that the cfd approach adopted in this paper can accurately forecast the relevant parameters of stopping maneuver using reversing propeller providing an alternative way to evaluate ship stopping ability an interesting phenomenon can be noticed that the ship turns to the starboard side and the lateral distance can be as large as 0 7 l in order to find out the cause of ship turning the pressure distribution on the stern and the wake flow around ship hull and propeller are presented and analyzed the distribution of dynamic pressure on the ship hull at time instant t 18 35 is shown in fig 7 it can be seen that a high pressure zone on the starboard side of the aft hull is appeared during the stopping maneuver while the change of pressure distribution on the port side is very small compared with the starboard side the different pressure distribution between the opposite sides on the aft hull leads to a lateral force which pushes the tail to the port side and turns the bow to the starboard side fig 8 shows the wake flow around ship hull and propeller at the same time instant the horizontal section demonstrates how the reversing propeller works during the stopping maneuver the fluid near the propeller is propelled to the front and the corresponding force in the opposite direction on the propeller slows down the ship speed it can be seen from fig 8b that the propeller propels the fluid around it to the upper right and lower left the upward moving fluid gathers and impacts on the hull forming a high pressure zone on the right aft as shown in fig 7 this phenomenon is called the reversing effect turning the rudder to the port or starboard side has great effect on the stopping maneuver using reversing propeller which is also called the astern port starboard stopping in order to investigate the different behaviors for reversing propeller with turning rudders the conditions of turning rudder to port starboard side are also simulated the numerical calculations start from a speed of 0 4905 m s in model scale then the full astern propeller is executed and in the meantime the rudder turns 35 in two different directions with the maximum rudder rate fig 9 shows the comparison of trajectory and longitudinal velocity between three types of stopping maneuver reversing the propeller with no rudder and reversing the propeller when turning the rudder to the port or starboard side so far there is no experimental data at the same condition to validate the cfd results only comparisons between numerical results are presented here from the simulation results we can see that full astern port will turn the ship to an opposite direction compared with the original no rudder case the track reach or the stopping distance is around 3 7 l and the lateral distance is about 0 47 l for the astern port case both the track reach and the lateral distance are reduced with a decrease of 12 and 32 respectively as for the astern starboard case the stopping distance is approximately 4 78 l which is obviously larger than the other two cases the turning direction for the ship is the same as the no rudder case while the lateral distance is reduced significantly with a value of 0 22 l fig 9b shows the stopping time of the three stopping conditions the astern port case meets the shortest time to stop the ship while the astern starboard case experiences the longest time it can be concluded that the astern port case can stop the ship quickly while the astern starboard can decrease the lateral distance but with a longer time to stop the ship in order to find out the reasons why stopping parameters have the above changes the pressure distribution on the stern and wake flow around the ship hull during stopping maneuver are presented and analyzed as follows the distribution of dynamic pressure in the aft of ship hull for the astern port case is shown in fig 10 it can be seen that the reversing effect still exists with a high pressure zone on the starboard side on the ship hull while the pressure distribution on the port side is quite complicated comparing with the case of no rudder the amplitude of the high pressure is smaller for the port side the area of low pressure zone is larger and as a result the total transverse force acting on the aft of ship hull pushes the ship stern to port preventing the ship from turning to port side although the reversing effect exists for the astern port case the ship still turns to the port side shown in fig 9a therefore the rudder effect is stronger than the reversing effect and the rudder force takes the main part in the turning moment fig 11 demonstrates the comparisons of yaw moments between port side rudder and starboard side rudder the left figure shows the total yaw moment for the ship and the right figure depicts the yaw moment generated by the rudder it is obvious that the port side rudder can give an overall positive rudder yaw moment for the ship which explains why the port side rudder can lead to an opposite direction of lateral deviation in addition fig 12 shows that the rudder blocks the fluid from being pushing forward the propelled water on the starboard side has lower speed compared with previous no rudder case which means that the impact force is smaller causing lower pressure the force acting on the rudder makes the ship turn port side while the side effect caused by reversing propeller has an opposite effect the comprehensive interaction turns the ship finally to the port side and the lateral distance is decreased compared with no rudder case when conducted astern starboard the lateral distance is unexpectedly reduced this can be explained by fig 11 where the time histories of yaw moment are compared with the port side rudder case it can be found that the time history of rudder yaw moment is fluctuating around zero which means that the rudder deflection to starboard side associated with reversing propeller cannot provide effective turning moment to help the ship turn to port or starboard side this is one of the reasons that the lateral deviation is smaller in the astern starboard case in order to explain the rudder effect in the astern starboard case the distribution of dynamic pressure on rudder is presented in fig 13 it can be seen that the pressure distribution is quite complicated for both the windward and leeward side rudder reversing propeller accelerates the inflow of the rudder in the forehead of rudder and lead to the high fluid velocity which results in the lower pressure in the forehead but high pressure occurs in the after of the rudder due to the downstream wake flow of the ship hull and propeller the interlacing distribution of positive and negative pressure on the rudder decreases the rudder effect and thus the rudder cannot provide effective turning force fig 14 shows the dynamic pressure distribution on the aft of ship hull with the astern starboard case it is obvious that the reversing effect caused by reversing propeller nearly disappears there is no pressure increasing phenomenon on the starboard side of ship hull this is another reason that the astern starboard case meets the smallest lateral distance fig 15 shows the wake flow around propeller and rudder in astern starboard case it can be noticed that flow velocity around the rudder is very high because of the reversing propeller the rudder cannot obviously change the velocity of water passing by it relatively the reaction force on the rudder is too small to provide enough pressure to change the course of the ship because of the existence of rudder the direction of propelled water on the right side of the propeller has been changed there will be little water directly impacting on the ship tail making reversing effect nearly disappears it is concluded that the astern starboard case diminishes the reversing effect and the reversing propeller makes the rudder effect very bad therefore the longitudinal distance increases and in the meantime the lateral distance is significantly reduced compared to the no rudder case 4 3 inertia stop apart from the astern stopping maneuver an alternative way to avoid the collision with obstacle in the open sea is to stop the engine in this part the simulations are performed with no propeller to evaluate the inertia stop performance with the consideration of static propeller during the simulation has little influence on the result similarly three degrees of freedom on the horizontal plane are released with a same initial advancing speed of 0 4905 m s in model scale two cases for the inertia stop condition are carried out the investigate the rudder effect on the performance of stopping maneuver the rudder executes to 35 in model scale for both port and starboard side in addition two different water depth are used in this part to study the shallow water effect on the inertia stop case in deep water case the water depth is 5l while in shallow water case the water depth is 1 8d where l stands for the length of ship d means the draft of the ship the main difference for the shallow water and deep water case is the boundary condition at bottom which has been illustrated in section 3 2 fig 16 shows the comparison of trajectory and the time histories of ship longitudinal speed for the inertia stop case using full rudder in different water depth from the figure we can see that the ship changes its course due to the rudder deflection meanwhile the ship speed in longitudinal direction is gradually decreased to zero in shallow water the stopping distance is a bit larger than that in deep water while the lateral distance is smaller fig 16b also shows that the longitudinal speed of ship in shallow water decreases slower than that in deep water it can be concluded that the shallow water has a bad effect on the maneuverability of ship using the turning rudder flow visualizations such as pressure distribution wake flow are presented to investigate the shallow water effect on the inertia stop case the distribution of dynamic pressure on the aft of ship hull and rudder at time instant t 20 is shown in fig 17 it can be seen that the pressure distribution on rudder shows significant difference where the pressure on rudder is larger in deep water compared with shallow water case it indicates that the rudder effect is better in deep water and the ship has a relatively bad maneuverability in shallow water this also corresponds to the turning trajectory shown in fig 16a fig 18 presents the wake flow around ship hull and rudder in both deep water and shallow water case at t 20 it can be seen that flow velocity after the ship in shallow water is much larger than that in deep water in shallow water the relative velocity between fluid and rudder is lower which means there will be less water impacting on the rudder resulting in lower pressure so the rudder force is decreased in shallow water making it more difficult to change the course of ship 4 4 turning circle as we all know turning circle test is the main approach to estimate the ship turning ability although the turning circle maneuver with the actual rotating propeller is not a stopping maneuver it is discussed here due to the fact that it is also used to avoid the collision in the open sea for ease of comparison with different ways of stopping maneuvers mentioned above the numerical calculation for the turning circle maneuver also starts from the steady state of self propulsion the propeller rate of revolution is set to a constant value of 10 52 r s which is obtained from the self propulsion simulation to reach equivalent between the propeller thrust and the total resistance with corresponding speed of 0 4905 m s 10kn in full scale then turning circle maneuver is achieved by the turning a starboard rudder with 35 two different water depth same as section 4 3 are also considered in this part to study water depth effect on the turning behavior fig 19 shows the comparison of turning circle trajectories in different water depth since the free running simulation using cfd is very time consuming and the cfd computations only calculate the initial turning stage the grey lines are extrapolated by the computed results for the deep water case the diameter of turning circle in deep water is approximately 2 9l while the turning diameter in shallow water is about 4 3l here l denotes the ship length the water depth has a significant effect on the turning circle maneuver and the shallow water effect is more obvious than the inertia stop condition discussed in sect 4 3 turning ability in shallow water becomes worse fig 20 presents the ship speed under different water depth it can be seen that ship speed in shallow water is significantly lower than that in deep water meanwhile the ship speed in deep water decreases faster which means the course of ship changes quicker the turning ability is much better in deep water fig 21 shows the pressure distribution on the windward side of rudder under different water depth at t 24 it is obvious that the water depth has great effect on the pressure distribution the area of high pressure zone in deep water is significantly larger than that in shallow water therefore the rudder effect in deep water is better which means larger rudder force and larger turning moment apart from the difference of high pressure zone it can also be found that there are wavy wiggles of pressure on the rudder surface in order to explain this phenomenon the vortical structures around propellers and rudders are presented in fig 22 it is obvious that the pressure distribution is strongly affected by the vortices separated from the propeller and rudder the vortices on the rudder surface are discontinuous and this can explain the pressure wavy wiggles on rudder this phenomenon happens during the turning motion with large rudder deflection similar results can also be found in other cfd investigations regarding turning maneuvers jin et al 2019 fig 23 shows the free surface elevation for the turning circle maneuvers during the steady turn in both deep and shallow water it is obvious that the wave height of the bow wave in shallow water is higher than that of the deep water case generally the wave making will be more obvious with the increase of ship speed however in this case the shallow water experiences a lower ship speed while the bow wave is more severe it is mainly due to the shallow water effect where the flow can hardly pass through the ship hull therefore the bow wave is higher and as a result the wave making resistance is larger in shallow water case this explains why the ship speed is smaller at the beginning in shallow water as shown in fig 20 4 5 comparison of stopping parameters fig 24 and fig 25 show the comparison of trajectories and longitudinal ship speeds between different maneuvers in deep water simulated in this paper in the figures rp stands for the reversing propeller case rp p means reversing propeller with port rudder rp s means reversing propeller with starboard rudder ne means no propeller case inertia stop case with starboard rudder ap s means turning circle with actual rotating propeller and starboard rudder it can be seen from fig 24 that the rp case with port rudder meets the minimum stopping distance if the kvlcc1 ship model needs to be completely stopped and the rp case with starboard rudder experiences the minimum lateral deviation if the ship has no need to be stopped completely such as the ship advancing in open sea to avoid collision the turning circle maneuver can be the best choice since it has the minimum track reach fig 25 shows the longitudinal speed of ship model under different maneuvers it can be easily seen that the turning circle maneuver with actual propeller and full starboard rudder ap s costs the shortest time to stop the ship while the rp case with starboard rudder experiences the longest time to stop other stopping maneuvers have the similar stopping time to quantitively analyze the predicted data table 2 presents the comparison of the main parameters for the different kinds of ship maneuvers it can be concluded that the turning circle maneuver is the most preferable way to avoid the collision in open sea since it has the shortest time and minimum advance if the ship needs to stop in port or waterways then the reversing propeller rp is better with the fact that it meets the relatively shorter later deviation among the rp cases the port rudder can decrease the track reach while the starboard case will reduce the lateral distance 5 conclusions this paper presents the cfd simulations of kvlcc1 ship model with different maneuvers i e reversing propeller with without turning rudder no propeller case inertia stop case and the original turning circle maneuver shallow water conditions are also simulated to investigate the water depth effects on the ship maneuvers numerical computations are carried out using in house cfd solver naoe foam sjtu based on overset grid technique the numerical results of self propulsion and order astern case with no rudder agree well with the experimental data showing that the numerical method adopted in this paper is reliable in predicting stopping ability of ship in model scale reversing the propeller can quickly reduce the longitudinal speed of ship the propelled water affects the distribution of wake flow and the pressure on the aft of ship hull which further result in the course changing of ship also known as the reversing effect in addition the reversing propeller case with port rudder reduces the stopping distance while the starboard rudder increases the stopping distance and the lateral deviation is smaller the reason is that the existence of rudder changes the wake flow around rudder and pressure distribution on ship hull which diminishes the reversing effect inertia stop case and the traditional turning circle maneuver can be used when the obstacle is far away in open area it is found that rudder effect is relatively bad in shallow water and the stopping ability of ships in shallow water is worse it is concluded that the turning circle maneuver is the most preferable way to avoid the collision in open sea however if the ship needs to stop in port or waterways then the reversing propeller rp is better with the fact that it meets the relatively shorter lateral deviation among the rp cases the port rudder can decrease the track reach while the starboard case will reduce the lateral distance in the future more degrees of freedom can be considered to improve the accuracy of the present cfd

22149,the crowded waterways and worse maneuverability of large ships could cause more collision accidents therefore it is necessary to study stopping ability of ships to ensure the navigational safety

computed to illustrate the water depth effect on the stopping performance the predicted trajectory and ship speed of different stopping maneuvers are presented and analyzed detail information of flow visualizations including pressure distribution and wake flow during stopping maneuver are discussed to explain the stopping behavior it is concluded that the turning circle maneuver is the most preferable way to avoid the collision in open sea however if the ship needs to stop in port or waterways then the reversing propeller rp is better due to the fact that it meets the relatively shorter lateral deviation keywords ship stopping maneuver overset grid method reversing propeller cfd simulation 1 introduction in recent years cargo ships such as container ship bulk carrier tend to become larger to reduce the cost of shipping and thus improve transport efficiency however a larger size of ship will worsen the maneuverability and accidents can easily occur in the crowded ports or channels therefore it is of great importance to study the stopping ability of large ships to prevent the ship from collision and to ensure the safety of a ship sailing near the port especially in shallow water since the operation on propeller and rudder changes the course of ship the trajectory of stopping maneuver is not a straight line as shown in fig 1 good stopping ability means minimum stopping distance also known as track reach horizontal distance or lateral distance and yaw angle generally reversing propeller is the most common operation when a large ship needs to brake to prevent collision in the procedure of stopping maneuver the bow will turn port or starboard side because of the side forces at the aft caused by the reversing propeller the existence of the lateral force caused by reversing propeller is found by chislett and smitt 1972 through ship model test apart from the reversing propeller approach several other operations on propeller and rudder such as turning rudder while reversing propeller turning rudder while stopping the engine also have some influences on the stopping ability when the obstacle is in the open sea turning circle maneuver can also be a preferable way to avoid the collision while in the meantime reduce the load of engine the stopping ability is a key standard to examine the ship performance traditionally empirical formula method and experimental method are used to evaluate the stopping ability of ships the requirements of an actual ship stopping experiment with free running facility are very difficult to achieve and the test cost is very high therefore estimation of ship stopping ability through numerical simulation is preferred at present numerical study of ship stopping maneuver still relies on captive model test at first mathematical model is established and the related hydrodynamic derivatives are separated then the ship hydrodynamic is predicted through either experiments or numerical simulations at last the ship maneuvering motion is calculated from the obtained parameters two kinds of mathematical model i e abkowitz model abkowitz 1980 and mmg model yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 were proposed to describe the maneuvering motion equations with different aspects of the way of the forces acting on the ship propeller and rudder and their interaction this approach has been widely used in the prediction of ship stopping ability crane 1967 used a non linear mathematical model with experimentally determined coefficients approach to do computations of stopping maneuvers it was concluded that the merits of various methods for improving stopping performance depend largely on ship speed of approach hooft 1970 presented the results of model experiments on a series 60 model regarding the governing factors in respect of the controllability during the stopping maneuver and gave a quasi stationary solution of the equations of motion in the horizontal plane dong et al 1996 used a mathematical model to compute ship motion in crash stopping and proposed a new method to deal with hydrodynamic forces and moments of propeller based on the principle of ship propulsion and maneuverability good agreements were achieved by comparing with sea trials and experiments lu 2007 conducted simulations of ship stopping motion by reverse propulsion where the stopping maneuver was calculated based on mmg model yabuki et al 2006 conducted experimental and numerical studies that aimed at investigating the characteristics of the stopping motion of a ship with a single controllable pitch propeller cpp and single rudder they used the mathematical model and considered the wind force ueno et al 2017 carried out numerical predictions for stopping maneuver of model scale kvlcc1 ship and proposed a j and speed correction jsc method to give predictions of full scale ship performance the stopping maneuver is simulated based on a three degree of freedom mathematical model free running model tests on ship stopping maneuver were also performed and compared with the numerical results although the most previous researches of stopping maneuver using mathematical model are convenient they cannot analyze the detailed interaction between the propeller and the ship among several approaches to predict ship maneuverability numerical simulation of free running ship with actual rotating propellers and turning rudders is the most reliant way to predict the complex flow interactions during ship maneuvering motion so far dynamic overset grid technique has been successfully applied to solve the problem of large amplitude ship motions and complex motion of ship hull propeller rudder interaction carrica et al 2012 performed the simulations of turn and zigzag maneuver using a self developed solver cfdship iowa and the operation of rudders were achieved by the dynamic overset grid technique while the rotating propellers were using body force model mofidi and carrica 2014 further extended their work by using the direct simulation of free running zigzag maneuver of kcs ship model where ship maneuver with actual rotating propeller and turning rudder were computed in calm water the results were promising when compared with the experiment although the authors emphasized that the computational cost in direct calculating free running ships was still very high after that carrica et al 2016 further investigated the direct simulation of zigzag maneuver of kcs ship model in shallow water recently dubbioso et al 2017 and muscari et al 2017 conducted cfd investigations of hydrodynamic loads on propellers in steady and transient maneuvers using overset grid approach shen et al 2015 implemented the dynamic overset grid module to the open source cfd software openfoam and presented some applications to the ship maneuvering motions wang et al 2017 2018 used the same approach to simulate the free running ship with applications to self propulsion zigzag maneuver turning circle maneuver in both calm water and waves which showed that the dynamic overset grid approach is a suitable and reliable way to predict strong interactions between ship hull propeller and rudder in the present paper the author uses the self developed naoe foam sjtu solver wang et al 2019a based on overset grid technique to directly simulate the ship stopping maneuver with rotating propellers and turning rudders the main purpose of this study is to propose an accurate way to predict the performance of ship stopping maneuver based on viscous flow computations actually this study not only considers the standard stopping maneuver also known as the full astern stopping maneuver but also carries out other types of maneuvers with the purpose of investigating the different ship performance through the operation on propeller and rudder main parameters of stopping maneuver such as the stopping distance the lateral distance are presented and compared with the available experiment detailed analysis and comparison of the pressure distribution and the wake flow around the ship are also presented the paper is organized as follows numerical methods including the naoe foam sjtu solver and numerical schemes are illustrated then the geometry model computational grid are presented self propulsion simulation is discussed firstly and then the detailed simulations of different types of maneuvers i e reversing propeller no propeller case inertia stop case turning circle are described subsequently finally a brief conclusion is drawn 2 numerical methods in the present study numerical simulations for ship stopping maneuvers are performed with the ship hydrodynamics cfd solver naoe foam sjtu which is developed on the open source platform openfoam and has the overset grid capability the solver includes a full 6dof motion module with a hierarchy of bodies therefore it is very convenient to achieve the numerical computations of free running ship based on the dynamic overset grid module and the 6dof motion with moving component different kinds of ship maneuvers can be simulated so far the present solver has the ability of simulating ship self propulsion zigzag maneuver turning circle maneuver and course keeping maneuver based on the control of movement of propeller and rudder fig 2 illustrates the diagram of the 6dof motion module in naoe foam sjtu solver the original modules in openfoam such as rans vof and turbulence models are marked with blue color these modules are further modified for sparse matrix solvers to excluded non active cells when using dynamic overset grid the stopping maneuver in the present study is simulated incorporating with the reversing propeller marked in red color module as we know it is rather difficult to reappear the actual operations in test case using cfd computations furthermore the present work mainly focuses on the integral values of stopping maneuver such as trajectory and velocity which are more or less dominated by the effects after the full astern execution considering the above aspects here we adopt the constant deacceleration approach to achieve the reversing control of the propeller the control mechanism of reversing propeller is by deaccelerate the rotational speed of propeller through 1 r r p r 0 k t t t p r 0 t t p where r r p is the rotational speed of reversing propeller r 0 is the original speed according to the corresponding ship speed k is the propeller accelerating rate here we use constant value 5 18r s2 and t p is the time when the rotational speed achieves the target value in addition turning circle maneuver is also used when considering the rudder reflection for the flow field calculation the present naoe foam sjtu solves the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations for unsteady turbulent flows around the advancing ship a volume of fluid vof approach with bounded compression technique is used berberović et al 2009 to capture the free surface the turbulence features are modeled by a blended k ω k ε shear stress transport sst turbulence model menter et al 2003 the velocity gradient near the wall is resolved by the wall function treatment up to now the naoe foam sjtu solver has been extensively validated various ship hydrodynamic cases e g ship resistance zha et al 2014 2015 seakeeping shen and wan 2013 2016 shen et al 2014 propulsion and maneuvering shen et al 2015 wang et al 2017 2018 2019b wang and wan 2018 the finite volume method fvm with unstructured grids is used to transform the governing equations from the physical space into the computational space the solution of the coupling velocity and pressure equations is obtained by using the pressure implicit with splitting of operator piso algorithm issa 1986 built in numerical schemes provided by openfoam are used to discretize the pdes and supported solvers are employed to solve the linear system of equations 3 geometry model and grid 3 1 geometry model the benchmark ship model kvlcc1 is used for the numerical simulations of ship stopping maneuver kvlcc1 is a single screw ship and it has been used as one of the benchmark models for cfd computation in previous 2008 simman workshop the geometric model is shown in fig 3 and main particulars of the ship model are listed in table 1 3 2 computational grid and boundary conditions the computational domain is divided into three parts the background grid the grid around the hull and the grid around propeller the unstructured grids are generated by the tool snappyhexmesh with the background grid generated by blockmesh as mentioned in the introduction part there are several computational grids used in the present work with consideration of different simulation conditions fig 4 shows the computational domain and overset grid arrangement in deep water and shallow water respectively in the present simulations the background domain extends to 1 5l x 3 0l 1 5l y 1 5l 1 0l z 0 5l and the range of hull domain is 0 15l x 1 2l 0 15l y 0 15l 0 2l z 0 2l for the shallow water case the range of z axis is the same with the corresponding water depth the grid spacing near wall is designed to meet the requirements using wall functions with y is around 30 the total grid number is 4 58 million and 4 35 million for the deep and shallow water case respectively the boundary conditions are shown in fig 4a the coordinate system and the definition of axis have also been shown in fig 4a the ship is moving forward instead of using inlet velocity thus the upstream boundary condition imposes zero velocity and zero gradient of pressure boundary conditions at downstream are identical with pressure outlet condition for the deep water case the bottom boundary condition imposes farfield condition while non slip boundary condition is applied for the bottom in shallow water case the grid size in the upstream and downstream is relatively coarse with the consideration of avoid reflection of ship waves by numerical dissipation 4 numerical simulations and discussions in the present work the self propulsion case is conducted firstly to validate the present cfd solver in predicting the hydrodynamic performance of free running kvlcc1 ship model with rotating propeller for the stopping maneuver using reversing propeller three conditions are considered no rudder port rudder and starboard rudder for the no propeller case inertia stop case port rudder and starboard rudder are carried out in the end a turning circle maneuver is also simulated to estimate the advance for the turning rudder cases the turning rate is the maximum rudder rate 24 5 deg s all the numerical simulations are conducted on the hpc cluster center in computational marine hydrodynamics lab cmhl shanghai jiao tong university each node consists of 2 cpus with 20 cores per node and 64 gb accessible memory intel xeon e5 2680v2 2 8 ghz 40 processors are assigned for each computation the time step is used to satisfy the requirement of the propeller rotation angle in each time step is no larger than 1 thus the time step is set relatively small with a value of 5 10 4 s and the corresponding courant number is about 0 15 in all the present simulations 4 1 self propulsion according to the free running kvlcc1 ship model experiments tsukada et al 2015 performed at national maritime research institute nmri basin the ship model is advancing in calm water with ship speed of 0 76 m s corresponding to the full scale ship 15 5kn the ship model is free to trim and sink during the simulation the ship speed is an input and a pi controller shen et al 2015 is used to control the rotational speed of propeller to achieve the equivalent between propeller thrust and the ship resistance at the corresponding target ship speed the self propulsion simulation starts from the steady state of the towing condition which means that the initial flow field for the self propulsion case is mapped from the steady flow of bare hull with corresponding ship speed fig 5 shows the time histories of the calculated rotational speed of propeller and the ship model speed under self propulsion condition the predicted results are also compared with the experimental data tsukada et al 2015 it can be seen that the predicted rotational speed of propeller is 17 02 r s when the ship reaches the target speed the calculated result is under predicted by 1 05 compared with the experimental data 17 2 r s from the time history of the instantaneous ship speed we can see that the ship speed firstly drops down due to the lower thrust provided by the propeller and the speed increases as the propeller rate speeds up and finally reaches the target ship speed it is proved that the numerical approach used in this paper can accurately predict the self propulsion performance of the kvlcc1 ship model which lays a good foundation for the simulations of stopping maneuver 4 2 reversing propeller generally reversing the propeller is the most common operation when a large ship needs to brake to prevent collision it is also known as the full astern stopping the simulation conditions are following the setup of experiments performed at nmri ueno et al 2017 where the model scale stopping maneuver starts with a speed of 0 4905 m s 10kn in full scale therefore a self propulsion simulation at this speed is firstly conducted and the predicted propeller rate of revolution is 10 52 r s since there is no available propeller rate data for this ship speed thus the full astern propeller rate of revolution 10 36 r s from the experiment ueno et al 2017 is used in the simulation of stopping maneuver the numerical computation of stopping maneuver starts from the steady state of self propulsion then the propeller is controlled to a reverse speed of 10 36 r s to carry out the crash astern stopping maneuver the authors who conducted the stopping maneuver experiments exclude the discussion of the duration time and we cannot do the exactly same control during the simulation the present simulations adopted the control mechanism as shown in eqn 1 to deaccelerate the propeller rate three degrees of freedom on the horizontal plane i e surge sway and yaw are released for the numerical simulations of reversing propeller and three conditions are simulated regarding to the rudder i e without rudder port rudder and starboard rudder the case of crash astern case without rudder turning is followed the experimental procedure and has been compared with the available data in this case and cases shown later the non dimensional parameters are used to identify the ship motion and trajectory the track reach and lateral distance are expressed as x l y l respectively non dimensional ship speed and time are defined as v v g l t t l g where l is the ship length and g is the acceleration of gravity the track reach and the lateral distance is calculated from the beginning point when the ship executes full astern to the end point when the ship speed is equals zero fig 6 shows the trajectory and ship speed comparisons between calculated results and the experimental data from nmri ueno et al 2017 because the x axis is point to the ship stern and the ship is advancing in the negative axis in the present paper the figure is mirrored in x axis it can be seen from the trajectory that the track reach and the lateral distance agree well with the experimental data the end point for simulation result is 3 90 0 673 is very close to the experimental measurement 4 02 0 703 the cfd result of stopping track is underestimated by 2 98 and the cfd result of lateral distance is 4 27 smaller than the experiment the predicted ship speed as shown in fig 6b matches well with the experiment for the time to complete stopping maneuver while some discrepancies are observed for the ship speed during the stopping process the predicted ship speed is smaller than that of the experimental data during the process which lead to the shorter travelled distance shown in fig 6a the overall agreement for the present simulation for the stopping maneuver indicates that the cfd approach adopted in this paper can accurately forecast the relevant parameters of stopping maneuver using reversing propeller providing an alternative way to evaluate ship stopping ability an interesting phenomenon can be noticed that the ship turns to the starboard side and the lateral distance can be as large as 0 7 l in order to find out the cause of ship turning the pressure distribution on the stern and the wake flow around ship hull and propeller are presented and analyzed the distribution of dynamic pressure on the ship hull at time instant t 18 35 is shown in fig 7 it can be seen that a high pressure zone on the starboard side of the aft hull is appeared during the stopping maneuver while the change of pressure distribution on the port side is very small compared with the starboard side the different pressure distribution between the opposite sides on the aft hull leads to a lateral force which pushes the tail to the port side and turns the bow to the starboard side fig 8 shows the wake flow around ship hull and propeller at the same time instant the horizontal section demonstrates how the reversing propeller works during the stopping maneuver the fluid near the propeller is propelled to the front and the corresponding force in the opposite direction on the propeller slows down the ship speed it can be seen from fig 8b that the propeller propels the fluid around it to the upper right and lower left the upward moving fluid gathers and impacts on the hull forming a high pressure zone on the right aft as shown in fig 7 this phenomenon is called the reversing effect turning the rudder to the port or starboard side has great effect on the stopping maneuver using reversing propeller which is also called the astern port starboard stopping in order to investigate the different behaviors for reversing propeller with turning rudders the conditions of turning rudder to port starboard side are also simulated the numerical calculations start from a speed of 0 4905 m s in model scale then the full astern propeller is executed and in the meantime the rudder turns 35 in two different directions with the maximum rudder rate fig 9 shows the comparison of trajectory and longitudinal velocity between three types of stopping maneuver reversing the propeller with no rudder and reversing the propeller when turning the rudder to the port or starboard side so far there is no experimental data at the same condition to validate the cfd results only comparisons between numerical results are presented here from the simulation results we can see that full astern port will turn the ship to an opposite direction compared with the original no rudder case the track reach or the stopping distance is around 3 7 l and the lateral distance is about 0 47 l for the astern port case both the track reach and the lateral distance are reduced with a decrease of 12 and 32 respectively as for the astern starboard case the stopping distance is approximately 4 78 l which is obviously larger than the other two cases the turning direction for the ship is the same as the no rudder case while the lateral distance is reduced significantly with a value of 0 22 l fig 9b shows the stopping time of the three stopping conditions the astern port case meets the shortest time to stop the ship while the astern starboard case experiences the longest time it can be concluded that the astern port case can stop the ship quickly while the astern starboard can decrease the lateral distance but with a longer time to stop the ship in order to find out the reasons why stopping parameters have the above changes the pressure distribution on the stern and wake flow around the ship hull during stopping maneuver are presented and analyzed as follows the distribution of dynamic pressure in the aft of ship hull for the astern port case is shown in fig 10 it can be seen that the reversing effect still exists with a high pressure zone on the starboard side on the ship hull while the pressure distribution on the port side is quite complicated comparing with the case of no rudder the amplitude of the high pressure is smaller for the port side the area of low pressure zone is larger and as a result the total transverse force acting on the aft of ship hull pushes the ship stern to port preventing the ship from turning to port side although the reversing effect exists for the astern port case the ship still turns to the port side shown in fig 9a therefore the rudder effect is stronger than the reversing effect and the rudder force takes the main part in the turning moment fig 11 demonstrates the comparisons of yaw moments between port side rudder and starboard side rudder the left figure shows the total yaw moment for the ship and the right figure depicts the yaw moment generated by the rudder it is obvious that the port side rudder can give an overall positive rudder yaw moment for the ship which explains why the port side rudder can lead to an opposite direction of lateral deviation in addition fig 12 shows that the rudder blocks the fluid from being pushing forward the propelled water on the starboard side has lower speed compared with previous no rudder case which means that the impact force is smaller causing lower pressure the force acting on the rudder makes the ship turn port side while the side effect caused by reversing propeller has an opposite effect the comprehensive interaction turns the ship finally to the port side and the lateral distance is decreased compared with no rudder case when conducted astern starboard the lateral distance is unexpectedly reduced this can be explained by fig 11 where the time histories of yaw moment are compared with the port side rudder case it can be found that the time history of rudder yaw moment is fluctuating around zero which means that the rudder deflection to starboard side associated with reversing propeller cannot provide effective turning moment to help the ship turn to port or starboard side this is one of the reasons that the lateral deviation is smaller in the astern starboard case in order to explain the rudder effect in the astern starboard case the distribution of dynamic pressure on rudder is presented in fig 13 it can be seen that the pressure distribution is quite complicated for both the windward and leeward side rudder reversing propeller accelerates the inflow of the rudder in the forehead of rudder and lead to the high fluid velocity which results in the lower pressure in the forehead but high pressure occurs in the after of the rudder due to the downstream wake flow of the ship hull and propeller the interlacing distribution of positive and negative pressure on the rudder decreases the rudder effect and thus the rudder cannot provide effective turning force fig 14 shows the dynamic pressure distribution on the aft of ship hull with the astern starboard case it is obvious that the reversing effect caused by reversing propeller nearly disappears there is no pressure increasing phenomenon on the starboard side of ship hull this is another reason that the astern starboard case meets the smallest lateral distance fig 15 shows the wake flow around propeller and rudder in astern starboard case it can be noticed that flow velocity around the rudder is very high because of the reversing propeller the rudder cannot obviously change the velocity of water passing by it relatively the reaction force on the rudder is too small to provide enough pressure to change the course of the ship because of the existence of rudder the direction of propelled water on the right side of the propeller has been changed there will be little water directly impacting on the ship tail making reversing effect nearly disappears it is concluded that the astern starboard case diminishes the reversing effect and the reversing propeller makes the rudder effect very bad therefore the longitudinal distance increases and in the meantime the lateral distance is significantly reduced compared to the no rudder case 4 3 inertia stop apart from the astern stopping maneuver an alternative way to avoid the collision with obstacle in the open sea is to stop the engine in this part the simulations are performed with no propeller to evaluate the inertia stop performance with the consideration of static propeller during the simulation has little influence on the result similarly three degrees of freedom on the horizontal plane are released with a same initial advancing speed of 0 4905 m s in model scale two cases for the inertia stop condition are carried out the investigate the rudder effect on the performance of stopping maneuver the rudder executes to 35 in model scale for both port and starboard side in addition two different water depth are used in this part to study the shallow water effect on the inertia stop case in deep water case the water depth is 5l while in shallow water case the water depth is 1 8d where l stands for the length of ship d means the draft of the ship the main difference for the shallow water and deep water case is the boundary condition at bottom which has been illustrated in section 3 2 fig 16 shows the comparison of trajectory and the time histories of ship longitudinal speed for the inertia stop case using full rudder in different water depth from the figure we can see that the ship changes its course due to the rudder deflection meanwhile the ship speed in longitudinal direction is gradually decreased to zero in shallow water the stopping distance is a bit larger than that in deep water while the lateral distance is smaller fig 16b also shows that the longitudinal speed of ship in shallow water decreases slower than that in deep water it can be concluded that the shallow water has a bad effect on the maneuverability of ship using the turning rudder flow visualizations such as pressure distribution wake flow are presented to investigate the shallow water effect on the inertia stop case the distribution of dynamic pressure on the aft of ship hull and rudder at time instant t 20 is shown in fig 17 it can be seen that the pressure distribution on rudder shows significant difference where the pressure on rudder is larger in deep water compared with shallow water case it indicates that the rudder effect is better in deep water and the ship has a relatively bad maneuverability in shallow water this also corresponds to the turning trajectory shown in fig 16a fig 18 presents the wake flow around ship hull and rudder in both deep water and shallow water case at t 20 it can be seen that flow velocity after the ship in shallow water is much larger than that in deep water in shallow water the relative velocity between fluid and rudder is lower which means there will be less water impacting on the rudder resulting in lower pressure so the rudder force is decreased in shallow water making it more difficult to change the course of ship 4 4 turning circle as we all know turning circle test is the main approach to estimate the ship turning ability although the turning circle maneuver with the actual rotating propeller is not a stopping maneuver it is discussed here due to the fact that it is also used to avoid the collision in the open sea for ease of comparison with different ways of stopping maneuvers mentioned above the numerical calculation for the turning circle maneuver also starts from the steady state of self propulsion the propeller rate of revolution is set to a constant value of 10 52 r s which is obtained from the self propulsion simulation to reach equivalent between the propeller thrust and the total resistance with corresponding speed of 0 4905 m s 10kn in full scale then turning circle maneuver is achieved by the turning a starboard rudder with 35 two different water depth same as section 4 3 are also considered in this part to study water depth effect on the turning behavior fig 19 shows the comparison of turning circle trajectories in different water depth since the free running simulation using cfd is very time consuming and the cfd computations only calculate the initial turning stage the grey lines are extrapolated by the computed results for the deep water case the diameter of turning circle in deep water is approximately 2 9l while the turning diameter in shallow water is about 4 3l here l denotes the ship length the water depth has a significant effect on the turning circle maneuver and the shallow water effect is more obvious than the inertia stop condition discussed in sect 4 3 turning ability in shallow water becomes worse fig 20 presents the ship speed under different water depth it can be seen that ship speed in shallow water is significantly lower than that in deep water meanwhile the ship speed in deep water decreases faster which means the course of ship changes quicker the turning ability is much better in deep water fig 21 shows the pressure distribution on the windward side of rudder under different water depth at t 24 it is obvious that the water depth has great effect on the pressure distribution the area of high pressure zone in deep water is significantly larger than that in shallow water therefore the rudder effect in deep water is better which means larger rudder force and larger turning moment apart from the difference of high pressure zone it can also be found that there are wavy wiggles of pressure on the rudder surface in order to explain this phenomenon the vortical structures around propellers and rudders are presented in fig 22 it is obvious that the pressure distribution is strongly affected by the vortices separated from the propeller and rudder the vortices on the rudder surface are discontinuous and this can explain the pressure wavy wiggles on rudder this phenomenon happens during the turning motion with large rudder deflection similar results can also be found in other cfd investigations regarding turning maneuvers jin et al 2019 fig 23 shows the free surface elevation for the turning circle maneuvers during the steady turn in both deep and shallow water it is obvious that the wave height of the bow wave in shallow water is higher than that of the deep water case generally the wave making will be more obvious with the increase of ship speed however in this case the shallow water experiences a lower ship speed while the bow wave is more severe it is mainly due to the shallow water effect where the flow can hardly pass through the ship hull therefore the bow wave is higher and as a result the wave making resistance is larger in shallow water case this explains why the ship speed is smaller at the beginning in shallow water as shown in fig 20 4 5 comparison of stopping parameters fig 24 and fig 25 show the comparison of trajectories and longitudinal ship speeds between different maneuvers in deep water simulated in this paper in the figures rp stands for the reversing propeller case rp p means reversing propeller with port rudder rp s means reversing propeller with starboard rudder ne means no propeller case inertia stop case with starboard rudder ap s means turning circle with actual rotating propeller and starboard rudder it can be seen from fig 24 that the rp case with port rudder meets the minimum stopping distance if the kvlcc1 ship model needs to be completely stopped and the rp case with starboard rudder experiences the minimum lateral deviation if the ship has no need to be stopped completely such as the ship advancing in open sea to avoid collision the turning circle maneuver can be the best choice since it has the minimum track reach fig 25 shows the longitudinal speed of ship model under different maneuvers it can be easily seen that the turning circle maneuver with actual propeller and full starboard rudder ap s costs the shortest time to stop the ship while the rp case with starboard rudder experiences the longest time to stop other stopping maneuvers have the similar stopping time to quantitively analyze the predicted data table 2 presents the comparison of the main parameters for the different kinds of ship maneuvers it can be concluded that the turning circle maneuver is the most preferable way to avoid the collision in open sea since it has the shortest time and minimum advance if the ship needs to stop in port or waterways then the reversing propeller rp is better with the fact that it meets the relatively shorter later deviation among the rp cases the port rudder can decrease the track reach while the starboard case will reduce the lateral distance 5 conclusions this paper presents the cfd simulations of kvlcc1 ship model with different maneuvers i e reversing propeller with without turning rudder no propeller case inertia stop case and the original turning circle maneuver shallow water conditions are also simulated to investigate the water depth effects on the ship maneuvers numerical computations are carried out using in house cfd solver naoe foam sjtu based on overset grid technique the numerical results of self propulsion and order astern case with no rudder agree well with the experimental data showing that the numerical method adopted in this paper is reliable in predicting stopping ability of ship in model scale reversing the propeller can quickly reduce the longitudinal speed of ship the propelled water affects the distribution of wake flow and the pressure on the aft of ship hull which further result in the course changing of ship also known as the reversing effect in addition the reversing propeller case with port rudder reduces the stopping distance while the starboard rudder increases the stopping distance and the lateral deviation is smaller the reason is that the existence of rudder changes the wake flow around rudder and pressure distribution on ship hull which diminishes the reversing effect inertia stop case and the traditional turning circle maneuver can be used when the obstacle is far away in open area it is found that rudder effect is relatively bad in shallow water and the stopping ability of ships in shallow water is worse it is concluded that the turning circle maneuver is the most preferable way to avoid the collision in open sea however if the ship needs to stop in port or waterways then the reversing propeller rp is better with the fact that it meets the relatively shorter lateral deviation among the rp cases the port rudder can decrease the track reach while the starboard case will reduce the lateral distance in the future more degrees of freedom can be considered to improve the accuracy of the present cfd simulation in addition larger scale ship model should also be simulated to evaluate the scale effects on the stopping maneuver author statement jianhua wang conceptualization methodology software
