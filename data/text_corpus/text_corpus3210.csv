fixation and negative emission technologies seem ever more necessary smith et al 2015 microalgae are one of the most efficient carbon capture species in nature effortlessly transforming inorganic carbon into complex organics in aquatic environments ooms et al 2016 microalgae driven carbon sequestration is an effective approach for blue carbon sinks dargusch and thomas 2012 macreadie et al 2019 with 1 8 2 4 kg of co2 sequestered per kg of microalgae biomass lu et al 2018 in addition the production and application of clean biofuels is an effective way to mitigate global warming and resolve the energy crisis liu et al 2012 tilman et al 2009 notably microalgal photosynthesis provides a sustainable pathway for the synthesis of high energy density liquid biofuels melis 2012 ooms et al 2016 microalgae are extremely promising as a feedstock for the third generation of biofuels georgianna and mayfield 2012 because of their high biomass productivity phukan et al 2011 fast growth rate duffy et al 2009 and low carbon footprint medeiros et al 2015 meanwhile there are numerous downstream uses for the microalgae biomass including feedstocks for health products parsons et al 2020 animal and fish feeds harun et al 2010 nutrient rich soil amendments and bioplastics production lu et al 2018 therefore the large scale industrial production of microalgae has attracted great interest large quantities of water are required for microalgae production and the cultivation process occupies the largest water footprint murphy and allen 2011 typically producing microalgae in a photobioreactor requires 200 500 kg of water per kg of wet biomass murphy and allen 2011 in addition 2 000 kg of water per kg of dry biomass is required when cultivation occurs in open runway ponds yang et al 2011 furthermore the soluble algae products saps and residual nutrients in the microalgal wastewater pose severe challenges to wastewater treatment microalgal wastewater recycling is an effective strategy for reducing the water footprint of the process treating microalgal wastewaters and improving resource efficiency georgianna and mayfield 2012 it has been reported that the wastewater recycling process reduces the inputs of nutrients and water by 55 and 84 respectively yang et al 2011 microalgal wastewater recycling has demonstrated enormous potential in enhancing ecological sustainability as improvements in resource efficiency are a prerequisite for ecological sustainability however there have been controversies surrounding the effect of recycled wastewater on the growth of microalgae some saps such as fatty acids inhibit microalgae growth bosma et al 2008 accumulated ions e g na k ca2 can gradually change the composition and physicochemical properties of the recycled wastewater which hinders the growth of microalgae hadj romdhane et al 2012 contrarily a pilot scale study demonstrated that halotolerant algae can be semi continuously cultured in recycled wastewaters for over 5 months to produce more biomass fon sing et al 2014 the biomass energy yield can be increased through wastewater recycling park et al 2013 to verify the feasibility of producing microalgae with recycled wastewaters it is necessary to investigate the characteristics of recycled wastewaters and then explore the mechanisms of microalgae growth in recycled wastewaters in addition dynamic simulations of microalgae production can not only predict the characteristic parameters for growth but also optimize operational design which can provide scientific guidance for industrial production most studies on microalgae growth models have focused on optimizing culture conditions albarello et al 2019 biomass productivity predictions huesemann et al 2016 and microalgal cytology predictions smith et al 2019 however these models do not address the effects of saps and residual nutrients in wastewaters on microalgae growth which is critical for the dynamic simulation of microalgae production with recycled wastewaters therefore it is essential to establish a microalgae growth model suitable for wastewater recycling systems herein a microalgal wastewater cyclic cultivation technology awc2t was proposed to reduce the water footprint and environmental pollution for microalgae production and improve resource efficiency a novel microalgae growth model agm was established for dynamic simulations and optimization of the operational scheme in addition this study investigated the characteristics of the recycled wastewater and figured out the effects and mechanisms of recycling wastewater on microalgae growth furthermore scenario simulations illustrated the excellent long term performance of awc2t meanwhile the techno economic analysis tea and the life cycle assessment lca compared the economic and environmental suitability outcomes between the awc2t and non cyclic technology the overall results provide specific guidance for microalgae production factories 2 overview of wastewater recycling cultivation system 2 1 description of microalgal wastewater cyclic cultivation technology to practice the wastewater recycling strategy a promising microalgal wastewater cyclic cultivation technology awc2t was proposed based on the concepts of a circular economy and clean production awc2t makes up for the deficiencies of non cyclic technology by allowing for high level resource recoveries which is a brown carbon offset methodology dargusch and thomas 2012 microalgae production is divided into two processes cultivation and harvesting fig 1 aeration keeps the microalgae in suspension exposing the cells to nutrients and light co2 provides a carbon source for the autotrophic growth of microalgae and neutralizes ph increases by the consumption of nitrate and phosphate chi et al 2013 the microalgae are harvested after they have reached a stable phase of growth the microalgae powders are obtained by first dewatering remaining dewatering carruthers et al 2019 and desiccation in turn in contrast with the direct discharge of wastewater that occurs during non recycling technology fig 1 the wastewater in the awc2t re enters the medium preparation unit for adjustments to achieve suitable microalgal growth conditions such as the replenishment of nutrients and adjustments to ph the adjusted wastewater is then used for microalgae cultivation forming a closed loop 2 2 establishment of the microalgae growth model modeling is essential for dynamic simulations of microalgae production in the awc2t system microalgae mainly grow autotrophically via photosynthesis fig 2 the respiration secretion natural death sedimentation and predation of microalgae indicate the existence of microalgae decay in the system some large molecular weight colloids and granular organic substances released by the decayed microalgae cannot be directly utilized by microalgae and accumulate in water extracellular enzymes can hydrolyze these substances into available nutrients gujer et al 1995 it is presumed that the nutrient sources of microalgae fall into two categories the first category is that of artificially added inorganic nutrients the second category is that of available nutrients from hydrolysis various nutrients will be adsorbed on the cell surface and then transported across the cell membrane to be used inside the cell which are the processes of adsorption and ingestion respectively the awc2t system operates under nutrient restricted conditions according to the monod model mierle 1985 microalgae growth can be quantitatively expressed by the concentration of nutrients the monod model is a dynamic description of nutrient ingestion by microalgae under steady state conditions and does not apply to nutrient restricted conditions dodds 1995 istvanovics and herodek 1995 however the ingestion rate of nutrients by microalgae is variable the droop model droop and r 1968 shows that phytoplankton cells can store nutrients and they release nutrients through respiration excretion and lysis therefore microalgae growth is also related to the nutrient concentration inside the cell the absorption rate of nutrients is a function of the external nutrient concentration and cell state microalgae growth is synergistically affected by the 3 levels of nutrient concentrations the nutrients in the water the nutrients on the surface of cells and nutrients inside the cells a novel microalgae growth model agm was established as shown in table 1 agm is a simplified model that only considers essential nutrients which are the structural molecules that constitute the cells and participate in the cell metabolism as shown in fig 3 the low mean absolute relative errors ε verified the accuracy of the agm simulation otherwise sensitivity analysis of the microalgae biomass output was performed fig s1 considering the variations and uncertainties of the parameters involved in the agm 3 materials and methods 3 1 experimental design chlorella pyrenoidosa fachb 9 the institute of hydrobiology at the chinese academy of sciences was cultured in a 1 l erlenmeyer flask an artificially modified basal medium with low n kno3 250 mg l 1 and p kh2po4 250 mg l 1 was used to achieve shortened culture times and higher lipid yields ngan et al 2015 the initial microalgae concentration was approximately 0 1 g l 1 the temperature was set as 25 2 the light intensity was about 5000 lux and the light dark ratio was 14 10 aeration 4 vol co2 with a total flow rate of 4 16 l min 1 provided the carbon source allowing the microalgae to be suspended in the culture and fully exposed to the nutrients and to light the microalgae were harvested by centrifugation at 2000 g for 5 min after they reached a stable phase of growth after each batch of microalgae harvesting the concentrations of the residual no3 and po4 3 in the recycled culture were determined and the nano3 and kh2po4 were replenished in the recycled culture to make the concentrations of no3 and po4 3 consistent with the initial medium n p the adjusted culture was reused to cultivate the next batch of microalgae after sterilization to explore the effect of nutrient replenishment on the microalgae growth in the wastewater recycling process a comparative experiment was designed to recycle the harvested wastewater without nutrient replenishment for subsequent microalgae cultivation after sterilization n p eight batches of cultivation were conducted in sequence for a total of 64 days 3 2 analytical method 3 2 1 assays of biomass intracellular components lipid peroxidation and enzyme activities according to the linear relationship between the microalgae biomass concentration and the od680 the microalgae biomass concentrations were determined by optical density measurements at a wavelength of 680 nm total lipids were measured by the chloroform methanol method zheng et al 2012 the lipid content was defined as the dry weight ratio of the extracted lipids to biomass the pigment content was calculated using an amended method by lichtenthaler lichtenthaler 1987 3 2 2 characterization methods for microalgae recycled wastewater dissolved organic carbon doc was determined by a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan to measure the sap contents polysaccharide contents were measured by the anthrone sulfuric acid method zhao et al 2017 specific ultraviolet absorbance suva is the ratio of uv254 to doc which reflects the degree of aromatization of the organic matter in the wastewater the fluorescence spectra of the saps were obtained using a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7100 fl hitachi japan phytohormones were quantified based on a uhplc ms ms platform which was performed on an agilent 1290 infinity ii uhplc system coupled to a 6470a triple quadrupole mass spectrometry santa clara ca us molecular weight mw distributions were analyzed by high performance size exclusion chromatography lc 20ad shimadzu japan the concentrations of no3 and po4 3 were measured according to the chinese state environmental protection agency standard methods sepa 2002 the concentrations of so4 2 and cl were measured by ion chromatography ic 2010plus shimadzu japan trace elements and metal ions were measured by icp oes optima 2100dv perkinelmer us salinity was measured by a conductivity meter rex ddsj 308f 3 2 3 uncertainty and sensitivity analysis a monte carlo analysis wang et al 2019 was conducted to generate the operational uncertainties and simulate the long term performance of the awc2t system with a random variation of 5 for the culture period and a random variation of 10 for the dosage of n p and microalgae inoculation twenty hypothetical microalgae production factories were simulated to run in parallel for the operational data in addition the monte carlo method was also conducted to identify the factors that played crucial roles in determining the production cost key parameters including the prices of water nutrients biomass and electricity and the recycling proportion were selected to conduct a sensitivity analysis on the return on production cost ropc the magnitude of variations in key parameters was set to 20 ropc was defined as the ratio of the total revenue to the production cost the factory was considered profitable when the ropc was greater than 1 the calculation of ropc was based on actual market prices and was calculated as follows ropc m p biom ass 1 n c 0 c v p v p w 1 j i h p e where m is the total mass of microalgae biomass kg and p biom ass is the price of the microalgae biomass kg 1 the nutrient concentrations before inoculation and after harvesting are represented by c0 kg m 3 and c kg m 3 respectively the total volume of water is expressed as v m3 where p is the unit price of the various nutrients kg 1 p w is the price of the water m 3 p e is the price of electricity kwh 1 i represents the power of the electrical equipment kw h is the working time of the electrical equipment h and n and j are the numbers of nutrients and electrical equipment respectively 3 2 4 statistical analysis the results in this study are expressed as arithmetic means the standard deviations of three replicates one way analysis of variance was used for the statistical analyses 3 3 scenario description to evaluate the performance of the awc2t system a microalgae production factory was assumed within the scenario chlorella proteinosa is cultured in 173 sets of solar lit photobioreactors amer et al 2011 with a total volume of 100 000 m³ the factory is located in yunnan province china which receives long term solar radiation and has a suitable temperature the factory operates 24 h daily 7 days per week which amounts to 8 300 h y 1 taking the ropc as the fitness function the optimal solution of the agm calculated by the genetic algorithm is set as the optimal operational scheme of the microalgae production factory that is the microalgae culturing period is 201 75 h per batch and the initial concentrations of n and p are 42 4 mg l 1 and 47 3 mg l 1 respectively the awc2t is used to produce microalgae biomass producing 41 batches per year the other nutrient concentrations are the same as those in the basal medium 3 3 1 economic assumptions a techno economic analysis tea was carried out to estimate and compare the economics of the awc2t and non cyclic technology system the lifetime of the above microalgae production factory is 20 years including 2 years of construction empowerment adjustment period and 18 years of production the revenue comes from sales and all products microalgae powder are sold all the assumptions are based on chinese market prices and literature reports davis et al 2011 masri et al 2019 sui et al 2020 the detailed economic assumptions are presented in table 2 and tables s2 s3 s4 3 3 2 lca method in this study lca was performed on 8 batches of microalgae produced by the aforementioned factory in other words the functional unit was 2 212 52 t of microalgae dry biomass the accounting boundaries included direct material consumption energy consumption such as stirring aeration pumping dewatering and desiccation and environmental pollution emissions during the entire life cycle of the microalgae production process the inventory consisted of experimental results and simulation outputs potential environmental impacts were assessed by using the cml ia baseline v3 05 eu25 method in a simapro software sun et al 2019 following the iso guidelines the selected impact categories were abiotic depletion abiotic depletion fossil fuels acidification eutrophication global warming gwp 100a ozone layer depletion odp human toxicity terrestrial ecotoxicity marine aquatic ecotoxicity fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity and photochemical oxidation 4 results and discussion 4 1 characterization of microalgae recycled wastewater 4 1 1 variation of common components characterization of the recycled wastewater contributed to revealing the effects and mechanisms of recycling wastewater on microalgae the composition and properties of the wastewater varied greatly during the wastewater recycling process many inorganic nutrients remained in the wastewater after microalgae harvesting table s5 c n and p are essential nutrients for microalgae growth the carbon source co2 provided by aeration was always sufficient each batch of microalgae cultivation consumed about 99 5 and 25 of n and p respectively fig 3b c and table s5 hence n and p had to be replenished the other inorganic nutrients were still sufficient for meeting the needs for subsequent microalgae growth after 8 cycles in addition the salinity of the n p culture increased by 0 01 0 02 per batch table s6 because of evaporation and nutrient replenishment the ph of the wastewater was slightly elevated due to the consumption of nitrate and phosphate nutrient replenishment and aeration could neutralize the ph organic matters namely saps were released into the wastewater by excretion and cell lysis the accumulation of saps resulted in a 2 37 fold increase in the doc of the n p culture fig 4 a the microalgae biomass in the n p culture was much higher than that in the n p culture so more saps were released in the n p culture the main components of the saps were identified as polysaccharides humic substances proteins amino acids and nucleic acids wang and zhang 2010 according to fig 4a polysaccharides accounted for the majority of the saps in the recycled wastewater the polysaccharide concentrations in the n p culture and the n p culture of the 8 batch were about 10 times and 3 times higher than those of the 1 batch respectively after 8 batches of cultivation the proportion of polysaccharides in the saps increased by 27 84 and 14 12 in the n p and n p cultures respectively the eem spectra fig s2 of the saps showed that proteins gradually decreased in the n p culture but slightly increased in the n p culture a significant increase in humic substances was observed in the recycled cultures fig 4b and fig s2 similar to polysaccharides the increment of humic substances in the n p culture was more than that in the n p culture suva decreased in the n p culture but increased slightly in the n p culture fig 4b in general microorganisms degrade amino acids berger and heppel 1974 tyrosine like proteins tryptophan like proteins and humic substances for endogenous metabolism when nutrients are scarce leading to a decrease in proteins and the degree of aromatization of the organic matters in the n p culture interestingly phytohormones were identified in the recycled wastewater mainly jasmonic acid ja salicylic acid sa indole 3 acetic acid iaa and isopentenyladenine ip fig 4c in addition isopentenyladenosine trans zeatin and trans zeatin riboside were also detected in the recycled wastewater which were not investigated due to their extremely low concentrations 0 002 ng ml 1 according to fig 4c the total amount of phytohormones in the n p culture was higher than that in the n p culture ja and sa accounted for the majority of the phytohormones since ja and sa can induce microalgae to resist stress zhao et al 2019 microalgae in the awc2t system with low nutrients and high salinity are likely to produce more ja and sa to enhance the defense system the content of ja was generally higher than that of sa suggesting that ja may be the major defense phytohormone of microalgae in the awc2t system moreover ip remained at low concentrations during the recycling process iaa increased gradually in the n p culture but was not detected in the recycled n p culture except for iaa no clear trends were observed for other phytohormones 4 1 2 molecular weight distributions of the saps in recycled wastewater the mw of the saps was distributed into three regions 1 103 d 103 107 d and 107 1013 d fig 4d the large mw 107 1013 d saps were confirmed mainly derived from the decay and lysis of microalgae cells wang and zhang 2010 and consisted of organic colloids and large mw polysaccharides the saps with mw between 103 d and 107 d were mostly humic substances and medium mw polysaccharides which were the main components of the recycled wastewater accounting for about 83 88 in the n p culture and 91 64 in the n p culture the saps of small mw 1 103 d mainly consisted of amino acids aliphatic compounds and small mw polysaccharides during the wastewater recycling process the saps of large mw and small mw distinctly increased while the saps of medium mw decreased indicating that the mw of the saps showed a trend toward polarization the variations in the mw distribution were more significant in the n p culture which was determined by the microalgae biomass 4 2 effect and mechanism of recycling wastewater on microalgae after 8 batches of cultivation 2 72 g l 1 microalgae dry biomass was obtained in the n p culture which was 273 higher than that in the n p culture fig 5 a low microalgae biomass was observed in the recycled n p culture confocal microscopic analysis also revealed that the number of cells in the n p culture was markedly lower than that in the n p culture at the same dilution fig 5b the microalgae biomass in the n p culture increased by 11 after 8 batches of cultivation fig 5a meanwhile the growth rate of microalgae increased during the recycling process fig 5c leading to a shortening of the lag phase and the log phase of growth it has been reported that the presence of sap can enhance the growth of microalgae baker 1994 amino acids humic substances small organic acids and polysaccharides can act as additional carbon and nitrogen sources which facilitates the microalgae growth in the recycled culture berger and heppel 1974 farooq et al 2015 additionally phytohormones are signaling molecules released by cell lysis and accumulated in the recycled wastewater playing an important role in the physiological and biochemical processes of microalgae the main function of iaa is to regulate cell elongation and division for the n p culture the accumulated iaa fig 4c could promote the growth of microalgae leading to an increase in biomass and growth rate further the high levels of ja and sa in the recycled cultures fig 4c could promote the defense response of microalgae in the awc2t system by intriguing the expression of defense genes thomma bart et al 1998 and regulating the antioxidant system mirshekari et al 2019 thus enhancing the growth of microalgae during the recycling process in summary the sap played a role not only in providing nutrients but also in regulating microalgal metabolism thus enhancing microalgae growth in the awc2t system the total lipid content of the 8 batch microalgae cultured in the n p culture and the n p culture was 37 65 and 47 32 higher than that of the 1 batch microalgae respectively fig 5d increases in the number and volume of lipid droplets were observed in the 8 batch of nile red stained cells fig 5b indicating the potential of microalgae to accumulate neutral lipids in the awc2t system the increasing salinity of the recycled culture was a stress to microalgae several studies have demonstrated that salinity stress and nitrogen starvation enhance microalgal lipid accumulation phukan et al 2011 wang et al 2019 the microalgae were under nitrogen starved conditions during the late growth stage fig 3b and the nitrogen deficiency was more severe in the n p culture therefore the lipid content of microalgae cultured in the n p culture was higher than that in the n p culture fig 5d since ja and sa can regulate the carbon flow distribution lee et al 2016 and iaa can improve the activity of key enzymes involved in the carbon fixation mechanism of microalgae guldhe et al 2019 the accumulation of these phytohormones might contribute to the increase of microalgal lipids the total pigment content decreased during the recycling process fig 5e because microalgae preferentially synthesized lipids to store energy nitrogen is a necessity for chlorophyll synthesis the chlorophyll content of the microalgae in the n p culture was lower than that in the n p culture which was due to the lack of nitrogen in the n p culture low chlorophyll fluorescence was observed in the n p culture fig 5b the microalgae gradually turned from green to yellowish green due to the decrease in chlorophyll but the carotenoid content remained stable which may be because microalgae require the antioxidant capacity of carotenoids to resist oxidative stresses caused by adversity pérez lópez et al 2014 although the microalgal chlorophyll decreased the microalgae in the n p culture showed superior growth performance indicating the feasibility of producing microalgae using awc2t 4 3 performance of microalgal wastewater recycling cultivation system hitherto the effect and role of the recycled wastewater on microalgae have been addressed and the feasibility of awc2t has also been verified however evaluating the performance of awc2t is of great significance for practical applications the long term performance of the hypothetical microalgae production factory was dynamically simulated by the agm fig s3 confirmed the accuracy of the simulation according to the simulated results the annual output of dry microalgae biomass was about 11339 18 t fig 6 a and a high heating value hhv of about 2 38 10 8 mj would be obtained by converting biomass into biocrude oil via hydrothermal liquefaction zhou et al 2013 the biomass output was essentially the same at different recycling proportions indicating the recycling proportions of wastewater had little influence on microalgae production suggesting the potential of awc2t for long term stable production about 20 410 52 27 214 02 t of co2 could be fixed per year by microalgal photosynthesis in this factory it was equivalent to co2 emissions of 277 58 370 11 tj crude oil or 318 4 424 54 tj natural gas liquids during stationary combustion 2006 ipcc guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories a total of 93 9 of the carbon fixed by the system flowed into the microalgae biomass and 6 1 flowed to the wastewater in the form of extracellular organic matter fig 6b the recycling of 100 of the microalgal wastewater would save 0 3 n and 54 36 p the concentration of n was the major limiting factor of this system and n was nearly exhausted before harvest fig 3b so the replenishment of n was much higher than that of other nutrients as shown in figs 6c d the replenishment of the nutrients varied slightly between the different microalgae production batches the magnitude of the variation in nutrient replenishment gradually increased as the recycling proportion raised the largest variation occurred when the recycling proportion of wastewater was 100 because of the high uncertainty brought about by the high recycling proportion the higher the recycling proportion of wastewater was the lower the resource consumption 100 recycling of wastewater had the highest resource efficiency and was most conducive to ecological sustainability sustainable development maximizes the net benefits of economic development on the premise of maintaining the quality of natural resources and the services they provide barbier 2005 the ropc reflects the rate of return on resource and energy inputs and measures the relationship between benefits and costs the simulation results showed that the ropc would rise exponentially with an increase in the recycling proportion of wastewater figs 6a c d the ropc value of 100 recycling was 7 times higher than that of no recycling revealing that awc2t would greatly improve the economy of microalgae production the economic benefits would be maximized at the recycling proportion of 100 therefore we believe that a recycling proportion of 100 was optimal for practical microalgae production a sensitivity analysis of the ropc was carried out by taking into account the fluctuation of market prices and the uncertainties of operation except for biomass price other prices were negatively correlated with the ropc figs 7 a e in the awc2t system the amount of water per batch was 361 times higher than biomass yield fig 6a and at least 10 000 times higher than nutrient requirements figs 6c d resulting in the highest sensitivity of recycling proportion fig 7f water and biomass were identified as the most influential aggregated categories for the ropc in actual production priority should be given to factors related to water and biomass for regulating production costs followed by nutrients and electricity related factors 4 4 techno economic analysis the tea in this study investigated the comprehensive economic impact of awc2t on microalgae production according to table 2 awc2t reduced the production costs for microalgae rendering the production of microalgae based biofuels economically viable the production cost was divided into the total capital expenditure tce and the total operating expenditure toe sui et al 2020 awc2t reduced production expenditure by reducing the toe resulting in a 9 52 reduction in the total production cost tpc the operational expenditure opex and productive expenditure prex of awc2t were reduced by 25 01 and 90 24 respectively although tax expenditure accounted for a large proportion of the toe a specific analysis of the tax expenditure was not carried out in this tea because it was not adjustable compared with non cyclic technology the net present value npv and internal rate of return irr of the awc2t increased by 6 88 and 9 14 respectively considering the time value of the currency the awc2t had a higher return on investment greater profitability and stronger risk resistance capacity exhibiting excellent economic suitability furthermore the allocation of economic costs for microalgae production between the two technologies was significantly different fig 8 a the awc2t significantly reduced the impact of the prex leading to the shift in the key economic control targets during actual production considering the variations in economic parameters in practice a sensitivity analysis of npv and irr was conducted with a variation of 20 the impacts of the six economic parameters on the npv and irr were consistent fig 8b both the npv and irr were markedly and positively affected by the output and price of microalgae indicating the output and price played crucial roles in the profitability and risk resistance capacity of the factory meanwhile the sensitivity of irr was affected by infrastructure expenditure inex and major equipment expenditure mee revealing that tce was closely related to the risk resistance capacity in addition the sensitivities of economic parameters of the awc2t were mostly lower than those of the non cyclic technology especially the sensitivity indices of prex which differed nearly 11 times signifying the awc2t system had a high contingency capacity and operational stability 4 5 life cycle environmental impact assessment an assessment of the life cycle environmental impacts of microalgae production is necessary which helps reveal many previously unknown environmental impacts the environmental impacts of the awc2t were substantially lower than those of the non cyclic technology on account of the bare waste discharge and minimal resource consumption of the awc2t system fig 9 a in particular fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity and eutrophication of the awc2t were reduced by 99 97 and 99 6 respectively compared with those of the non cyclic technology lca is a cradle to grave overall assessment it should be noted that negative impacts on the atmosphere inevitably occurred throughout the entire life cycle of the microalgae production greenhouse gases ghgs mainly came from the upstream production of feedstocks and energy consumption the global warming potential of awc2t was approximately 1 3 of that of the non cyclic technology over 100 years indicating that awc2t was superior in effective mitigation of global warming wastewater treatment factories have been recognized as one of the largest emitters of ghgs lu et al 2018 the wastewater recycling strategy significantly reduced the carbon footprint of the subsequent wastewater treatment in addition the abiotic depletion of the awc2t was reduced by 71 6 compared to the non cyclic technology indicating the high resource efficiency of the awc2t hence the awc2t demonstrated superior environmental suitability compared with the non cyclic technology the environmental impacts of microalgae production mainly depended on four impact factors electricity water nutrients and waste fig 9b wastewater containing saps and residual nutrients was the dominant waste discharged from the factory for the non cyclic technology the contribution proportions of waste to eutrophication and aquatic ecotoxicity were more than 90 the awc2t significantly reduced the environmental impact of waste which was beneficial to human health and the health of aquatic environments the contributions of nutrients and electricity were emphasized since the awc2t reduced the environmental impacts of water the high contribution proportion of nutrients was mainly caused by the upstream production transportation and waste disposal china s electricity profile mainly depends on burning fossil fuels which has manifested in the depletion of the ozone layer and an increase in ecotoxicity this study investigated the sensitivity of electricity water nutrients and waste to the total environmental impact of the entire life cycle of microalgae production with a variation of 20 according to fig 9c waste was the most sensitive impact factor for the two technologies however there was a positive correlation between the amount of waste and the output of microalgae to reduce negative environmental impacts while maintaining microalgae output it is necessary to regulate the other three impact factors that were positively correlated with the total environmental impact for the non cyclic technology electricity water and nutrients were much less sensitive than waste indicating a low feasibility for reducing the total environmental impact by regulating these three impact factors however the sensitivities of these three impact factors for the awc2t were relatively high especially the sensitivity of nutrients for the awc2t was 37 times higher than that for the non cyclic technology compared with the non cyclic technology it was more feasible for awc2t to regulate the environmental impacts suggesting the awc2t had a great controllability of environmental impacts 5 conclusions recycled wastewater not only enhanced the biomass and lipids but also accelerated the growth rate of microalgae revealing the feasibility of the awc2t in addition the accumulated saps not only provided nutrients for microalgae growth but also regulated the microalgal metabolism thus enhancing microalgae growth in the awc2t system the scenario simulation for large scale microalgae production illustrated the long term production stability and high resource efficiency of the awc2t furthermore the tea demonstrated the awc2t had great profitability strong risk resistance and high operation stability the environmental suitability of the awc2t was highlighted by comparing the life cycle environmental impacts of the awc2t and non cyclic technology credit authorship contribution statement jingjing sun conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation writing original

algae product techno economic analysis life cycle assessment 1 introduction global warming is potentially the greatest environmental and public health threat of this century wang et al 2020 carbon fixation and negative emission technologies seem ever more necessary smith et al 2015 microalgae are one of the most efficient carbon capture species in nature effortlessly transforming inorganic carbon into complex organics in aquatic environments ooms et al 2016 microalgae driven carbon sequestration is an effective approach for blue carbon sinks dargusch and thomas 2012 macreadie et al 2019 with 1 8 2 4 kg of co2 sequestered per kg of microalgae biomass lu et al 2018 in addition the production and application of clean biofuels is an effective way to mitigate global warming and resolve the energy crisis liu et al 2012 tilman et al 2009 notably microalgal photosynthesis provides a sustainable pathway for the synthesis of high energy density liquid biofuels melis 2012 ooms et al 2016 microalgae are extremely promising as a feedstock for the third generation of biofuels georgianna and mayfield 2012 because of their high biomass productivity phukan et al 2011 fast growth rate duffy et al 2009 and low carbon footprint medeiros et al 2015 meanwhile there are numerous downstream uses for the microalgae biomass including feedstocks for health products parsons et al 2020 animal and fish feeds harun et al 2010 nutrient rich soil amendments and bioplastics production lu et al 2018 therefore the large scale industrial production of microalgae has attracted great interest large quantities of water are required for microalgae production and the cultivation process occupies the largest water footprint murphy and allen 2011 typically producing microalgae in a photobioreactor requires 200 500 kg of water per kg of wet biomass murphy and allen 2011 in addition 2 000 kg of water per kg of dry biomass is required when cultivation occurs in open runway ponds yang et al 2011 furthermore the soluble algae products saps and residual nutrients in the microalgal wastewater pose severe challenges to wastewater treatment microalgal wastewater recycling is an effective strategy for reducing the water footprint of the process treating microalgal wastewaters and improving resource efficiency georgianna and mayfield 2012 it has been reported that the wastewater recycling process reduces the inputs of nutrients and water by 55 and 84 respectively yang et al 2011 microalgal wastewater recycling has demonstrated enormous potential in enhancing ecological sustainability as improvements in resource efficiency are a prerequisite for ecological sustainability however there have been controversies surrounding the effect of recycled wastewater on the growth of microalgae some saps such as fatty acids inhibit microalgae growth bosma et al 2008 accumulated ions e g na k ca2 can gradually change the composition and physicochemical properties of the recycled wastewater which hinders the growth of microalgae hadj romdhane et al 2012 contrarily a pilot scale study demonstrated that halotolerant algae can be semi continuously cultured in recycled wastewaters for over 5 months to produce more biomass fon sing et al 2014 the biomass energy yield can be increased through wastewater recycling park et al 2013 to verify the feasibility of producing microalgae with recycled wastewaters it is necessary to investigate the characteristics of recycled wastewaters and then explore the mechanisms of microalgae growth in recycled wastewaters in addition dynamic simulations of microalgae production can not only predict the characteristic parameters for growth but also optimize operational design which can provide scientific guidance for industrial production most studies on microalgae growth models have focused on optimizing culture conditions albarello et al 2019 biomass productivity predictions huesemann et al 2016 and microalgal cytology predictions smith et al 2019 however these models do not address the effects of saps and residual nutrients in wastewaters on microalgae growth which is critical for the dynamic simulation of microalgae production with recycled wastewaters therefore it is essential to establish a microalgae growth model suitable for wastewater recycling systems herein a microalgal wastewater cyclic cultivation technology awc2t was proposed to reduce the water footprint and environmental pollution for microalgae production and improve resource efficiency a novel microalgae growth model agm was established for dynamic simulations and optimization of the operational scheme in addition this study investigated the characteristics of the recycled wastewater and figured out the effects and mechanisms of recycling wastewater on microalgae growth furthermore scenario simulations illustrated the excellent long term performance of awc2t meanwhile the techno economic analysis tea and the life cycle assessment lca compared the economic and environmental suitability outcomes between the awc2t and non cyclic technology the overall results provide specific guidance for microalgae production factories 2 overview of wastewater recycling cultivation system 2 1 description of microalgal wastewater cyclic cultivation technology to practice the wastewater recycling strategy a promising microalgal wastewater cyclic cultivation technology awc2t was proposed based on the concepts of a circular economy and clean production awc2t makes up for the deficiencies of non cyclic technology by allowing for high level resource recoveries which is a brown carbon offset methodology dargusch and thomas 2012 microalgae production is divided into two processes cultivation and harvesting fig 1 aeration keeps the microalgae in suspension exposing the cells to nutrients and light co2 provides a carbon source for the autotrophic growth of microalgae and neutralizes ph increases by the consumption of nitrate and phosphate chi et al 2013 the microalgae are harvested after they have reached a stable phase of growth the microalgae powders are obtained by first dewatering remaining dewatering carruthers et al 2019 and desiccation in turn in contrast with the direct discharge of wastewater that occurs during non recycling technology fig 1 the wastewater in the awc2t re enters the medium preparation unit for adjustments to achieve suitable microalgal growth conditions such as the replenishment of nutrients and adjustments to ph the adjusted wastewater is then used for microalgae cultivation forming a closed loop 2 2 establishment of the microalgae growth model modeling is essential for dynamic simulations of microalgae production in the awc2t system microalgae mainly grow autotrophically via photosynthesis fig 2 the respiration secretion natural death sedimentation and predation of microalgae indicate the existence of microalgae decay in the system some large molecular weight colloids and granular organic substances released by the decayed microalgae cannot be directly utilized by microalgae and accumulate in water extracellular enzymes can hydrolyze these substances into available nutrients gujer et al 1995 it is presumed that the nutrient sources of microalgae fall into two categories the first category is that of artificially added inorganic nutrients the second category is that of available nutrients from hydrolysis various nutrients will be adsorbed on the cell surface and then transported across the cell membrane to be used inside the cell which are the processes of adsorption and ingestion respectively the awc2t system operates under nutrient restricted conditions according to the monod model mierle 1985 microalgae growth can be quantitatively expressed by the concentration of nutrients the monod model is a dynamic description of nutrient ingestion by microalgae under steady state conditions and does not apply to nutrient restricted conditions dodds 1995 istvanovics and herodek 1995 however the ingestion rate of nutrients by microalgae is variable the droop model droop and r 1968 shows that phytoplankton cells can store nutrients and they release nutrients through respiration excretion and lysis therefore microalgae growth is also related to the nutrient concentration inside the cell the absorption rate of nutrients is a function of the external nutrient concentration and cell state microalgae growth is synergistically affected by the 3 levels of nutrient concentrations the nutrients in the water the nutrients on the surface of cells and nutrients inside the cells a novel microalgae growth model agm was established as shown in table 1 agm is a simplified model that only considers essential nutrients which are the structural molecules that constitute the cells and participate in the cell metabolism as shown in fig 3 the low mean absolute relative errors ε verified the accuracy of the agm simulation otherwise sensitivity analysis of the microalgae biomass output was performed fig s1 considering the variations and uncertainties of the parameters involved in the agm 3 materials and methods 3 1 experimental design chlorella pyrenoidosa fachb 9 the institute of hydrobiology at the chinese academy of sciences was cultured in a 1 l erlenmeyer flask an artificially modified basal medium with low n kno3 250 mg l 1 and p kh2po4 250 mg l 1 was used to achieve shortened culture times and higher lipid yields ngan et al 2015 the initial microalgae concentration was approximately 0 1 g l 1 the temperature was set as 25 2 the light intensity was about 5000 lux and the light dark ratio was 14 10 aeration 4 vol co2 with a total flow rate of 4 16 l min 1 provided the carbon source allowing the microalgae to be suspended in the culture and fully exposed to the nutrients and to light the microalgae were harvested by centrifugation at 2000 g for 5 min after they reached a stable phase of growth after each batch of microalgae harvesting the concentrations of the residual no3 and po4 3 in the recycled culture were determined and the nano3 and kh2po4 were replenished in the recycled culture to make the concentrations of no3 and po4 3 consistent with the initial medium n p the adjusted culture was reused to cultivate the next batch of microalgae after sterilization to explore the effect of nutrient replenishment on the microalgae growth in the wastewater recycling process a comparative experiment was designed to recycle the harvested wastewater without nutrient replenishment for subsequent microalgae cultivation after sterilization n p eight batches of cultivation were conducted in sequence for a total of 64 days 3 2 analytical method 3 2 1 assays of biomass intracellular components lipid peroxidation and enzyme activities according to the linear relationship between the microalgae biomass concentration and the od680 the microalgae biomass concentrations were determined by optical density measurements at a wavelength of 680 nm total lipids were measured by the chloroform methanol method zheng et al 2012 the lipid content was defined as the dry weight ratio of the extracted lipids to biomass the pigment content was calculated using an amended method by lichtenthaler lichtenthaler 1987 3 2 2 characterization methods for microalgae recycled wastewater dissolved organic carbon doc was determined by a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan to measure the sap contents polysaccharide contents were measured by the anthrone sulfuric acid method zhao et al 2017 specific ultraviolet absorbance suva is the ratio of uv254 to doc which reflects the degree of aromatization of the organic matter in the wastewater the fluorescence spectra of the saps were obtained using a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7100 fl hitachi japan phytohormones were quantified based on a uhplc ms ms platform which was performed on an agilent 1290 infinity ii uhplc system coupled to a 6470a triple quadrupole mass spectrometry santa clara ca us molecular weight mw distributions were analyzed by high performance size exclusion chromatography lc 20ad shimadzu japan the concentrations of no3 and po4 3 were measured according to the chinese state environmental protection agency standard methods sepa 2002 the concentrations of so4 2 and cl were measured by ion chromatography ic 2010plus shimadzu japan trace elements and metal ions were measured by icp oes optima 2100dv perkinelmer us salinity was measured by a conductivity meter rex ddsj 308f 3 2 3 uncertainty and sensitivity analysis a monte carlo analysis wang et al 2019 was conducted to generate the operational uncertainties and simulate the long term performance of the awc2t system with a random variation of 5 for the culture period and a random variation of 10 for the dosage of n p and microalgae inoculation twenty hypothetical microalgae production factories were simulated to run in parallel for the operational data in addition the monte carlo method was also conducted to identify the factors that played crucial roles in determining the production cost key parameters including the prices of water nutrients biomass and electricity and the recycling proportion were selected to conduct a sensitivity analysis on the return on production cost ropc the magnitude of variations in key parameters was set to 20 ropc was defined as the ratio of the total revenue to the production cost the factory was considered profitable when the ropc was greater than 1 the calculation of ropc was based on actual market prices and was calculated as follows ropc m p biom ass 1 n c 0 c v p v p w 1 j i h p e where m is the total mass of microalgae biomass kg and p biom ass is the price of the microalgae biomass kg 1 the nutrient concentrations before inoculation and after harvesting are represented by c0 kg m 3 and c kg m 3 respectively the total volume of water is expressed as v m3 where p is the unit price of the various nutrients kg 1 p w is the price of the water m 3 p e is the price of electricity kwh 1 i represents the power of the electrical equipment kw h is the working time of the electrical equipment h and n and j are the numbers of nutrients and electrical equipment respectively 3 2 4 statistical analysis the results in this study are expressed as arithmetic means the standard deviations of three replicates one way analysis of variance was used for the statistical analyses 3 3 scenario description to evaluate the performance of the awc2t system a microalgae production factory was assumed within the scenario chlorella proteinosa is cultured in 173 sets of solar lit photobioreactors amer et al 2011 with a total volume of 100 000 m³ the factory is located in yunnan province china which receives long term solar radiation and has a suitable temperature the factory operates 24 h daily 7 days per week which amounts to 8 300 h y 1 taking the ropc as the fitness function the optimal solution of the agm calculated by the genetic algorithm is set as the optimal operational scheme of the microalgae production factory that is the microalgae culturing period is 201 75 h per batch and the initial concentrations of n and p are 42 4 mg l 1 and 47 3 mg l 1 respectively the awc2t is used to produce microalgae biomass producing 41 batches per year the other nutrient concentrations are the same as those in the basal medium 3 3 1 economic assumptions a techno economic analysis tea was carried out to estimate and compare the economics of the awc2t and non cyclic technology system the lifetime of the above microalgae production factory is 20 years including 2 years of construction empowerment adjustment period and 18 years of production the revenue comes from sales and all products microalgae powder are sold all the assumptions are based on chinese market prices and literature reports davis et al 2011 masri et al 2019 sui et al 2020 the detailed economic assumptions are presented in table 2 and tables s2 s3 s4 3 3 2 lca method in this study lca was performed on 8 batches of microalgae produced by the aforementioned factory in other words the functional unit was 2 212 52 t of microalgae dry biomass the accounting boundaries included direct material consumption energy consumption such as stirring aeration pumping dewatering and desiccation and environmental pollution emissions during the entire life cycle of the microalgae production process the inventory consisted of experimental results and simulation outputs potential environmental impacts were assessed by using the cml ia baseline v3 05 eu25 method in a simapro software sun et al 2019 following the iso guidelines the selected impact categories were abiotic depletion abiotic depletion fossil fuels acidification eutrophication global warming gwp 100a ozone layer depletion odp human toxicity terrestrial ecotoxicity marine aquatic ecotoxicity fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity and photochemical oxidation 4 results and discussion 4 1 characterization of microalgae recycled wastewater 4 1 1 variation of common components characterization of the recycled wastewater contributed to revealing the effects and mechanisms of recycling wastewater on microalgae the composition and properties of the wastewater varied greatly during the wastewater recycling process many inorganic nutrients remained in the wastewater after microalgae harvesting table s5 c n and p are essential nutrients for microalgae growth the carbon source co2 provided by aeration was always sufficient each batch of microalgae cultivation consumed about 99 5 and 25 of n and p respectively fig 3b c and table s5 hence n and p had to be replenished the other inorganic nutrients were still sufficient for meeting the needs for subsequent microalgae growth after 8 cycles in addition the salinity of the n p culture increased by 0 01 0 02 per batch table s6 because of evaporation and nutrient replenishment the ph of the wastewater was slightly elevated due to the consumption of nitrate and phosphate nutrient replenishment and aeration could neutralize the ph organic matters namely saps were released into the wastewater by excretion and cell lysis the accumulation of saps resulted in a 2 37 fold increase in the doc of the n p culture fig 4 a the microalgae biomass in the n p culture was much higher than that in the n p culture so more saps were released in the n p culture the main components of the saps were identified as polysaccharides humic substances proteins amino acids and nucleic acids wang and zhang 2010 according to fig 4a polysaccharides accounted for the majority of the saps in the recycled wastewater the polysaccharide concentrations in the n p culture and the n p culture of the 8 batch were about 10 times and 3 times higher than those of the 1 batch respectively after 8 batches of cultivation the proportion of polysaccharides in the saps increased by 27 84 and 14 12 in the n p and n p cultures respectively the eem spectra fig s2 of the saps showed that proteins gradually decreased in the n p culture but slightly increased in the n p culture a significant increase in humic substances was observed in the recycled cultures fig 4b and fig s2 similar to polysaccharides the increment of humic substances in the n p culture was more than that in the n p culture suva decreased in the n p culture but increased slightly in the n p culture fig 4b in general microorganisms degrade amino acids berger and heppel 1974 tyrosine like proteins tryptophan like proteins and humic substances for endogenous metabolism when nutrients are scarce leading to a decrease in proteins and the degree of aromatization of the organic matters in the n p culture interestingly phytohormones were identified in the recycled wastewater mainly jasmonic acid ja salicylic acid sa indole 3 acetic acid iaa and isopentenyladenine ip fig 4c in addition isopentenyladenosine trans zeatin and trans zeatin riboside were also detected in the recycled wastewater which were not investigated due to their extremely low concentrations 0 002 ng ml 1 according to fig 4c the total amount of phytohormones in the n p culture was higher than that in the n p culture ja and sa accounted for the majority of the phytohormones since ja and sa can induce microalgae to resist stress zhao et al 2019 microalgae in the awc2t system with low nutrients and high salinity are likely to produce more ja and sa to enhance the defense system the content of ja was generally higher than that of sa suggesting that ja may be the major defense phytohormone of microalgae in the awc2t system moreover ip remained at low concentrations during the recycling process iaa increased gradually in the n p culture but was not detected in the recycled n p culture except for iaa no clear trends were observed for other phytohormones 4 1 2 molecular weight distributions of the saps in recycled wastewater the mw of the saps was distributed into three regions 1 103 d 103 107 d and 107 1013 d fig 4d the large mw 107 1013 d saps were confirmed mainly derived from the decay and lysis of microalgae cells wang and zhang 2010 and consisted of organic colloids and large mw polysaccharides the saps with mw between 103 d and 107 d were mostly humic substances and medium mw polysaccharides which were the main components of the recycled wastewater accounting for about 83 88 in the n p culture and 91 64 in the n p culture the saps of small mw 1 103 d mainly consisted of amino acids aliphatic compounds and small mw polysaccharides during the wastewater recycling process the saps of large mw and small mw distinctly increased while the saps of medium mw decreased indicating that the mw of the saps showed a trend toward polarization the variations in the mw distribution were more significant in the n p culture which was determined by the microalgae biomass 4 2 effect and mechanism of recycling wastewater on microalgae after 8 batches of cultivation 2 72 g l 1 microalgae dry biomass was obtained in the n p culture which was 273 higher than that in the n p culture fig 5 a low microalgae biomass was observed in the recycled n p culture confocal microscopic analysis also revealed that the number of cells in the n p culture was markedly lower than that in the n p culture at the same dilution fig 5b the microalgae biomass in the n p culture increased by 11 after 8 batches of cultivation fig 5a meanwhile the growth rate of microalgae increased during the recycling process fig 5c leading to a shortening of the lag phase and the log phase of growth it has been reported that the presence of sap can enhance the growth of microalgae baker 1994 amino acids humic substances small organic acids and polysaccharides can act as additional carbon and nitrogen sources which facilitates the microalgae growth in the recycled culture berger and heppel 1974 farooq et al 2015 additionally phytohormones are signaling molecules released by cell lysis and accumulated in the recycled wastewater playing an important role in the physiological and biochemical processes of microalgae the main function of iaa is to regulate cell elongation and division for the n p culture the accumulated iaa fig 4c could promote the growth of microalgae leading to an increase in biomass and growth rate further the high levels of ja and sa in the recycled cultures fig 4c could promote the defense response of microalgae in the awc2t system by intriguing the expression of defense genes thomma bart et al 1998 and regulating the antioxidant system mirshekari et al 2019 thus enhancing the growth of microalgae during the recycling process in summary the sap played a role not only in providing nutrients but also in regulating microalgal metabolism thus enhancing microalgae growth in the awc2t system the total lipid content of the 8 batch microalgae cultured in the n p culture and the n p culture was 37 65 and 47 32 higher than that of the 1 batch microalgae respectively fig 5d increases in the number and volume of lipid droplets were observed in the 8 batch of nile red stained cells fig 5b indicating the potential of microalgae to accumulate neutral lipids in the awc2t system the increasing salinity of the recycled culture was a stress to microalgae several studies have demonstrated that salinity stress and nitrogen starvation enhance microalgal lipid accumulation phukan et al 2011 wang et al 2019 the microalgae were under nitrogen starved conditions during the late growth stage fig 3b and the nitrogen deficiency was more severe in the n p culture therefore the lipid content of microalgae cultured in the n p culture was higher than that in the n p culture fig 5d since ja and sa can regulate the carbon flow distribution lee et al 2016 and iaa can improve the activity of key enzymes involved in the carbon fixation mechanism of microalgae guldhe et al 2019 the accumulation of these phytohormones might contribute to the increase of microalgal lipids the total pigment content decreased during the recycling process fig 5e because microalgae preferentially synthesized lipids to store energy nitrogen is a necessity for chlorophyll synthesis the chlorophyll content of the microalgae in the n p culture was lower than that in the n p culture which was due to the lack of nitrogen in the n p culture low chlorophyll fluorescence was observed in the n p culture fig 5b the microalgae gradually turned from green to yellowish green due to the decrease in chlorophyll but the carotenoid content remained stable which may be because microalgae require the antioxidant capacity of carotenoids to resist oxidative stresses caused by adversity pérez lópez et al 2014 although the microalgal chlorophyll decreased the microalgae in the n p culture showed superior growth performance indicating the feasibility of producing microalgae using awc2t 4 3 performance of microalgal wastewater recycling cultivation system hitherto the effect and role of the recycled wastewater on microalgae have been addressed and the feasibility of awc2t has also been verified however evaluating the performance of awc2t is of great significance for practical applications the long term performance of the hypothetical microalgae production factory was dynamically simulated by the agm fig s3 confirmed the accuracy of the simulation according to the simulated results the annual output of dry microalgae biomass was about 11339 18 t fig 6 a and a high heating value hhv of about 2 38 10 8 mj would be obtained by converting biomass into biocrude oil via hydrothermal liquefaction zhou et al 2013 the biomass output was essentially the same at different recycling proportions indicating the recycling proportions of wastewater had little influence on microalgae production suggesting the potential of awc2t for long term stable production about 20 410 52 27 214 02 t of co2 could be fixed per year by microalgal photosynthesis in this factory it was equivalent to co2 emissions of 277 58 370 11 tj crude oil or 318 4 424 54 tj natural gas liquids during stationary combustion 2006 ipcc guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories a total of 93 9 of the carbon fixed by the system flowed into the microalgae biomass and 6 1 flowed to the wastewater in the form of extracellular organic matter fig 6b the recycling of 100 of the microalgal wastewater would save 0 3 n and 54 36 p the concentration of n was the major limiting factor of this system and n was nearly exhausted before harvest fig 3b so the replenishment of n was much higher than that of other nutrients as shown in figs 6c d the replenishment of the nutrients varied slightly between the different microalgae production batches the magnitude of the variation in nutrient replenishment gradually increased as the recycling proportion raised the largest variation occurred when the recycling proportion of wastewater was 100 because of the high uncertainty brought about by the high recycling proportion the higher the recycling proportion of wastewater was the lower the resource consumption 100 recycling of wastewater had the highest resource efficiency and was most conducive to ecological sustainability sustainable development maximizes the net benefits of economic development on the premise of maintaining the quality of natural resources and the services they provide barbier 2005 the ropc reflects the rate of return on resource and energy inputs and measures the relationship between benefits and costs the simulation results showed that the ropc would rise exponentially with an increase in the recycling proportion of wastewater figs 6a c d the ropc value of 100 recycling was 7 times higher than that of no recycling revealing that awc2t would greatly improve the economy of microalgae production the economic benefits would be maximized at the recycling proportion of 100 therefore we believe that a recycling proportion of 100 was optimal for practical microalgae production a sensitivity analysis of the ropc was carried out by taking into account the fluctuation of market prices and the uncertainties of operation except for biomass price other prices were negatively correlated with the ropc figs 7 a e in the awc2t system the amount of water per batch was 361 times higher than biomass yield fig 6a and at least 10 000 times higher than nutrient requirements figs 6c d resulting in the highest sensitivity of recycling proportion fig 7f water and biomass were identified as the most influential aggregated categories for the ropc in actual production priority should be given to factors related to water and biomass for regulating production costs followed by nutrients and electricity related factors 4 4 techno economic analysis the tea in this study investigated the comprehensive economic impact of awc2t on microalgae production according to table 2 awc2t reduced the production costs for microalgae rendering the production of microalgae based biofuels economically viable the production cost was divided into the total capital expenditure tce and the total operating expenditure toe sui et al 2020 awc2t reduced production expenditure by reducing the toe resulting in a 9 52 reduction in the total production cost tpc the operational expenditure opex and productive expenditure prex of awc2t were reduced by 25 01 and 90 24 respectively although tax expenditure accounted for a large proportion of the toe a specific analysis of the tax expenditure was not carried out in this tea because it was not adjustable compared with non cyclic technology the net present value npv and internal rate of return irr of the awc2t increased by 6 88 and 9 14 respectively considering the time value of the currency the awc2t had a higher return on investment greater profitability and stronger risk resistance capacity exhibiting excellent economic suitability furthermore the allocation of economic costs for microalgae production between the two technologies was significantly different fig 8 a the awc2t significantly reduced the impact of the prex leading to the shift in the key economic control targets during actual production considering the variations in economic parameters in practice a sensitivity analysis of npv and irr was conducted with a variation of 20 the impacts of the six economic parameters on the npv and irr were consistent fig 8b both the npv and irr were markedly and positively affected by the output and price of microalgae indicating the output and price played crucial roles in the profitability and risk resistance capacity of the factory meanwhile the sensitivity of irr was affected by infrastructure expenditure inex and major equipment expenditure mee revealing that tce was closely related to the risk resistance capacity in addition the sensitivities of economic parameters of the awc2t were mostly lower than those of the non cyclic technology especially the sensitivity indices of prex which differed nearly 11 times signifying the awc2t system had a high contingency capacity and operational stability 4 5 life cycle environmental impact assessment an assessment of the life cycle environmental impacts of microalgae production is necessary which helps reveal many previously unknown environmental impacts the environmental impacts of the awc2t were substantially lower than those of the non cyclic technology on account of the bare waste discharge and minimal resource consumption of the awc2t system fig 9 a in particular fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity and eutrophication of the awc2t were reduced by 99 97 and 99 6 respectively compared with those of the non cyclic technology lca is a cradle to grave overall assessment it should be noted that negative impacts on the atmosphere inevitably occurred throughout the entire life cycle of the microalgae production greenhouse gases ghgs mainly came from the upstream production of feedstocks and energy consumption the global warming potential of awc2t was approximately 1 3 of that of the non cyclic technology over 100 years indicating that awc2t was superior in effective mitigation of global warming wastewater treatment factories have been recognized as one of the largest emitters of ghgs lu et al 2018 the wastewater recycling strategy significantly reduced the carbon footprint of the subsequent wastewater treatment in addition the abiotic depletion of the awc2t was reduced by 71 6 compared to the non cyclic technology indicating the high resource efficiency of the awc2t hence the awc2t demonstrated superior environmental suitability compared with the non cyclic technology the environmental impacts of microalgae production mainly depended on four impact factors electricity water nutrients and waste fig 9b wastewater containing saps and residual nutrients was the dominant waste discharged from the factory for the non cyclic technology the contribution proportions of waste to eutrophication and aquatic ecotoxicity were more than 90 the awc2t significantly reduced the environmental impact of waste which was beneficial to human health and the health of aquatic environments the contributions of nutrients and electricity were emphasized since the awc2t reduced the environmental impacts of water the high contribution proportion of nutrients was mainly caused by the upstream production transportation and waste disposal china s electricity profile mainly depends on burning fossil fuels which has manifested in the depletion of the ozone layer and an increase in ecotoxicity this study investigated the sensitivity of electricity water nutrients and waste to the total environmental impact of the entire life cycle of microalgae production with a variation of 20 according to fig 9c waste was the most sensitive impact factor for the two technologies however there was a positive correlation between the amount of waste and the output of microalgae to reduce negative environmental impacts while maintaining microalgae output it is necessary to regulate the other three impact factors that were positively correlated with the total environmental impact for the non cyclic technology electricity water and nutrients were much less sensitive than waste indicating a low feasibility for reducing the total environmental impact by regulating these three impact factors however the sensitivities of these three impact factors for the awc2t were relatively high especially the sensitivity of nutrients for the awc2t was 37 times higher than that for the non cyclic technology compared with the non cyclic technology it was more feasible for awc2t to regulate the environmental impacts suggesting the awc2t had a great controllability of environmental impacts 5 conclusions recycled wastewater not only enhanced the biomass and lipids but also accelerated the growth rate of microalgae revealing the feasibility of the awc2t in addition the accumulated saps not only provided nutrients for microalgae growth but also regulated the microalgal metabolism thus enhancing microalgae growth in the awc2t system the scenario simulation for large scale microalgae production illustrated the long term production stability and high resource efficiency of the awc2t furthermore the tea demonstrated the awc2t had great profitability strong risk resistance and high operation stability the environmental suitability of the awc2t was highlighted by comparing the life cycle environmental impacts of the awc2t and non cyclic technology credit authorship contribution statement jingjing sun conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation writing original

16051,antimony trioxide sb2o3 is one of the primary forms of sb in the environment and its dissolution significantly impacts the migration and bioavailability of sb however the dissolution of sb2o3 coupled with abiotic redox of mn processes is unclear here we investigated the kinetics of sb2o3 dissolution in the presence of the ubiquitous mn ii by kinetic experiments spectroscopies density functional theory calculations and the chemical kinetic modeling the oxidative dissolution of sb2o3 was catalyzed by mn ii through the in situ generated amorphous mn oxides mnox under oxic conditions during which the generation of mn iii is a critical step in sb v release the released sb v was partially retained on mnox through bidentate binuclear corner sharing complexes as revealed by extended x ray absorption fine structure analysis the coexistent morphological forms of sb2o3 i e senarmontite and valentinite exhibited distinct dissolution patterns valentinite showed higher activity in catalyzing mn ii oxidation and faster oxidative dissolution than senarmontite due to its higher surface energy and lower conduction band minimum of its exposed facets these abiotic processes can extrapolate to other metal loid s hydr oxides further supplying for the comprehensive understanding of the redox transformation of mn graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords surface catalyzed oxidation oxidative dissolution kinetics chemical reaction model antimony trioxide manganese 1 introduction antimony sb is considered a priority pollutant by the united states environmental protection agency and its oxides sb2o3 is classified as possible carcinogens by the international agency for research on cancer filella et al 2009b international agency for research on cancer world health organization 2022 sb2o3 is one of the primary forms of sb in the environment enriched in sediments and soils via anthropogenic activities filella et al 2009a hu et al 2014 as well as microbial dissimilatory reduction abin and hollibaugh 2014 lai et al 2016 yamamura et al 2021 the dissolution of sb2o3 can profoundly alter mobility and bioavailability of sb and such process can be significantly accelerated by organic ligands increasing temperature and visible radiation hu and he 2017 hu et al 2014 zotov et al 2003 the coupling sb iii oxidation after its release into water or sediment environments affects the geochemical fate of sb oorts et al 2008 which generates more soluble and mobile sb v oxyanions and could further elevate the potential risk of sb migration mn oxides coexist with sb and significantly control sb redox transformation and solubility in sediments chen et al 2003 doherty et al 2021 under oxygen deficient conditions mn oxides were largely dissolved and released mn ii and pre adsorbed sb which could be subsequently reduced to dissolved sb iii or solid sb2o3 through the microbial dissimilatory process lai et al 2016 yamamura et al 2021 on the other hand mn ii could be oxidized back to mn oxides in sediments when water table dropped with the infiltration of air homoncik et al 2010 williams and oostrom 2000 these mn oxides mainly contributed to the oxidation of dissolved sb iii sun et al 2019 2018 wang et al 2012 recent finding has also suggested that an elevated dissolution potential could arise from the oxidative dissolution of sb2o3 minerals when encountered with mn oxides shan et al 2020 however such dissolution process slowed down with prolonged reaction time shan et al 2020 and similar kinetic patterns have also been observed in cases of uo2 and cr iii minerals pan et al 2019 qian et al 2020 wang et al 2013 the surface passivation along with the mn oxides depletion was suggested as the possible mechanism that hindered the dissolution kinetics however during the oxidation process of mn ii in realistic redox transition zones the in situ generation of mn oxides can provide a continuous thermodynamic driving force for the dissolution reaction of metal loid minerals including sb2o3 the abiotic mn ii oxidation by dissolved oxygen do dominates under neutral and alkaline conditions especially in the presence of solid surfaces the surface catalyzed mn ii oxidation occurred in goethite hematite ferrihydrite lepidocrocite silica and alumina suspensions by electron transfer from surface complexes or through electrochemical pathway davies and morgan 1989 inoue et al 2019 lan et al 2017 meanwhile the reactive mn species could be also produced from the reactions between mn ii and the surface of metal loid minerals and were believed to continuously drive the oxidative dissolution of u iv or cr iii minerals into dissolved u vi or cr vi namgung et al 2014 wang et al 2014 recently a facet dependent oxidation of mn ii on hematite indicated the facets containing highly reactive binding sites could induce distinct nucleation and growth behaviors of mn oxides liu et al 2021 furthermore the intrinsic property of exposed facets on metal loid minerals could also alter the surface reactivity exhibiting facet dependent dissolution or oxidation process of minerals including pyrite and cadmium sulfide huang et al 2021 zhu et al 2018 senarmontite and valentinite are the principal morphologic forms of sb2o3 with different exposed facets biver and shotyk 2013 and are the main secondary minerals in soils and sediments nearby some sb mining sites roper et al 2012 with typical ambient ph above 8 due to the coexistence of calcite and dolomite filella et al 2009a however to date little attention has been paid on mn ii oxidation on their exposed facets and their subsequent effect on sb mobilization under alkaline conditions here the reaction mechanisms of complex heterogeneous processes involving simultaneous surface catalyzed oxidative precipitation of mn oxides and dissolution of metal loid minerals are evaluated systematically by molecular spectroscopies and elementary kinetic modeling the primary objectives of this study are i to access the critical step in the coupled process of mn redox cycling and sb2o3 oxidative dissolution ii to evaluate surface effect on the dissolution of valentinite and senarmontite as well as mn ii oxidation by density functional theory dft calculations iii to apply chemical kinetic modeling in describing the proposed mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical reagents the details of the chemical reagents used in this study can be found by referring to text s1 2 2 sb2o3 dissolution kinetic experiments the sb2o3 dissolution kinetic experiments were conducted in screw top 40 ml amber vials to avoid photo induced processes which affected sb2o3 oxidation dissolution hu et al 2014 and mn redox cycling learman et al 2011 by generating reactive oxygen species aliquots of 25 ml sb2o3 suspensions 1 166 g l 1 in 50 mm kno3 were buffered with 50 mm mops ph 7 and ph 8 or ches ph 9 namgung et al 2014 various mn ii stock solution volumes were pipetted into the vials to make the mn ii initial concentrations of 0 0 05 0 5 and 5 mm to evaluate the potential involving of mn iii in the oxidative dissolution 0 5 and 5 mm pp were added to sb2o3 suspension with 5 mm mn ii addition at ph 9 all vials were placed on a reciprocating shaker 200 rpm in the dark at 25 2 c for 7 days an aliquot of suspension 1 ml was withdrawn at selected time intervals followed by vigorously shaken and filtered through 0 22 µm pes membranes after completion of the last sampling the residual solids were washed twice in water freeze dried transferred to aluminum foil wrapped tubes and stored in a desiccator an additional experiment was carried out inside an anoxic glovebox aw 400sg electrotek uk to evaluate the dissolved oxygen do effect on sb2o3 dissolution in the presence of mn ii this assay was followed the same procedure described above except gas purging for 1 h with n2 prior to the start of kinetic experiments 2 3 mn ii oxidation in the absence of sb2o3 to evaluate the aqueous mn ii oxidation by do same procedures were adopted as described above but in the absence of sb2o3 the solids were washed twice in water after 7 days freeze dried transferred to aluminum foil wrapped tubes and stored in a desiccator 2 4 analysis of dissolved metal concentrations and characterization of solid phases the dissolved sb and mn were determined by hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry and flame atomic adsorption spectrometry respectively phase identification and characterization of solid samples were conducted by x ray diffraction analysis xrd scanning electron microscope sem high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps sb k edge x ray absorption structure xas spectroscopies were conducted at the beamline bl14w1 of the shanghai synchrotron radiation facility ssrf in transmission mode the detailed methods can be found in text s2 2 5 dft calculations dft calculations were performed using the vienna ab initio simulation package vasp kresse and hafner 1993 detailed information is provided in text s3 2 6 kinetic modeling the collected kinetic data of the oxidative dissolution of sb2o3 and the dissolved mn ii were modeled using kintecus v6 50 ianni 2018 the reaction networks table 1 were set according to the proposed mechanisms in this study as well as previous reports shi et al 2018 van benschoten et al 1992 the dynamics of sb species and mn ii in solution were modeled simultaneously and sbtot was obtained by adding modeled sb iii and sb v concentrations sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the relative importance of each reaction for sb v generation based on the model output further information regarding model construction simplifications and assumptions can be referred to text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 oxidative dissolution of sb2o3 in the presence of mn ii the oxic sb2o3 dissolution experiments indicated that the release of dissolved sb was substantially promoted up to 1 2 3 3 and 12 folds as compared to that in the absence of aqueous mn ii with 30 7 75 4 and 90 6 of the total dissolved sb sbtot to be oxidized to sb v sb v when 0 05 0 5 and 5 mm of mn ii was added after 7 days at ph 9 respectively fig 1 no significant promotion of the sb2o3 dissolution or sb iii oxidation at ph 7 and 8 were observed in the presence of mn ii fig s5 in the absence of mn ii the equilibrium concentration of dissolved sb 30 μm was reached within 2 h and remained constant till day 7 in the ph range of 7 9 which agreed with previous study as the ph independent process was primarily limited by the solubility of sb2o3 fig 1a hu et al 2014 zotov et al 2003 under anoxic conditions sb2o3 dissolution reached a steady state within 1 day and no sb v was detected which were almost invariable regarding ph and the concentration of mn ii added fig s6 the dynamics of dissolved mn ii during sb2o3 dissolution were also analyzed the removal rates k obs of mn ii in the presence and absence of sb2o3 can be simplistically described by a pseudo first order rate law text s5 the k obs were 0 048 0 589 and 7 739 day 1 when initial mn ii addition increased from 0 05 to 0 5 to 5 mm respectively in the presence of sb2o3 at ph 9 under oxic condition fig s7 table s4 while no significant change was observed in mn ii concentration without do fig s8 however the k obs of mn ii removal in the absence of sb2o3 were 0 067 1 001 and 14 550 day 1 which were higher than in the presence of sb2o3 at ph 9 the observations were contradicted to the common understanding of catalytic oxidation of mn ii on the surface of metal oxides davies and morgan 1989 liu et al 2021 during which the removal rates should be accelerated by the presence of heterogeneous surface reaction indicating the likely involvement of an alternative redox mechanism on sb2o3 surface as discussed later to further explore the redox states of mnox on the surface of these solids at ph 9 the high resolution xps spectra of mn2p3 2 were obtained and conducted for peak fitting of mn ii mn iii and mn iv fig s9 table s5 the peak intensity of the 5 mm mn ii addition was higher than that of 0 5 mm addition indicating more mnox generated on sb2o3 alongside the higher mn ii addition the peak for mn 2p3 2 of 0 05 mm mn ii addition was negligible due to its low load on the mineral surface data not shown the peak fitting indicated mn iii became the dominant species on sb2o3 surface with its proportion increased from 59 51 to 77 08 while the proportion of mn ii on sb2o3 surface decreased from 23 81 to 11 14 when the addition of mn ii increased from 0 5 to 5 mm the changes in the remaining solid phase after sb2o3 dissolution experiments in the presence of mn ii at ph 7 9 were further identified by xrd and sem the xrd results indicated that the pristine commercial sb2o3 used in this study consisted of a mixture of two polymorphs valentinite and senarmontite fig s10 these two structures coexist ubiquitously in naturally occurring antimony oxides biver and shotyk 2013 after sb2o3 dissolution experiment no evident new peaks but a weak hump appeared in xrd spectra from around 15 2θ to 35 2θ with 5 mm mn ii addition at ph 9 which indicated the possible formation of amorphous mnox the relative amounts of valentinite valentinite and senarmontite senarmontite were estimated by the integral intensity of their xrd patterns the valentinite were 90 8 88 2 85 5 and 81 9 and senarmontite were 9 2 11 8 14 5 18 1 when the initial mn ii concentrations increased from 0 0 05 0 5 and 5 mm respectively the sem results indicated that senarmontite showed large octahedron shape with edge length of 2 μm and valentinite exhibited nanobelt shape with 1 μm in width and 0 2 μm in length either in dense bundles or in separate particles fig 2 a c in addition the number and size of valentinite particles significantly decreased with increasing mn ii addition fig 2a c these results together indicated valentinite was preferentially dissolved and consistent with previous studies biver and shotyk 2013 which may arise from their different morphologies size and surface reactivity and subsequent catalytic effect exerted on mn redox process 3 2 contribution of surface effects on sb2o3 dissolution and mn ii oxidation the combination of sem and hrtem revealed the morphologies and surface structures of the two sb2o3 polymorphs senarmontite exposed predominantly the equivalent facets of 111 as the lattice fringes of 0 32 and 0 28 nm spacings observed in hrtem image corresponded to 222 and 400 planes pereira et al 2012 zhang et al 2001 respectively fig 2d the orthogonal planes of 010 and 002 of valentinite were observed with 1 25 and 0 27 nm lattice fringe spacings respectively suggesting the particle were elongated along 100 direction with exposing side facets including 010 110 and a small fraction of 310 as well as base facet 002 fig 2e which were consistent with previous study vuković et al 2014 the surface energies of different sb2o3 facets were calculated by the dft method table s2 the 111 facets of face centered cubic senarmontite has a surface energy of 0 053 10 2 j m 2 being the most stable facet the 010 110 and 310 facets of orthorhombic valentinite have higher surface energy 6 197 2 266 and 10 081 10 2 j m 2 respectively than senarmontite the significant difference in surface energies of different facets of valentinite and senarmontite hinted that distinct thermodynamic reaction potentials would be expected for different sb2o3 phases as results of the differences in morphology and facets beside particle size from a theoretical perspective it supported the above findings from kinetic experiments as well as previous study that valentinite is a comparatively metastable phase biver and shotyk 2013 a further examination of the hrtem images figs 2d e s11 showed that significant amorphous phases were formed on the surface of sb2o3 during the dissolution reaction in the presence of 0 05 or 0 5 mm mn ii under oxic condition at ph 9 line scan and mapping results of tem and sem spectra indicated the generation of amorphous mnox was more evident with higher mn ii addition figs 2f s12 which agreed with the solution chemistry and the xps results therefore based on the aforementioned observations and literature reports the reaction of mn ii oxidation was assumed to proceed via interfacial catalytic pathway or electrochemical pathway both pathways were further examined by theoretical calculations for the interfacial catalytic pathway facets 010 110 and 310 of valentinite with higher surface energies than facet 111 of senarmontite table s2 are more reactive and thus should facilitate the adsorption of mn ii and o2 promoting mn ii oxidation by increasing their local concentrations lan et al 2017 luo et al 2020 furthermore these high surface energy facets may be also prone to stabilize the transient product between mn ii and o2 lowering the activation energy for the electron transfer between them davies and morgan 1989 for the electrochemical pathway it was reported that the difference between the absolute energy of electrons es in suspension and the absolute energy of the conduction band minimum ecbm for semiconductor was crucial in determining mn ii oxidation if the es in suspension is higher than ecbm for minerals electrons can flow from mn ii to minerals without contact with each other lan et al 2017 in this study the es of the hypothetical mn ii mn iii ox redox couples are 4 61 4 55 and 4 49 ev at 0 05 0 5 and 5 mm mn ii respectively the corresponding es of the mn ii mn iv ox redox couples are 4 73 4 71 and 4 68 ev respectively the experimentally determined ecbm for bulk sb2o3 is 4 82 ev xu and schoonen 2000 while different band structures especially conduction band edges would be expected for the different exposed facets of valentinite and senarmontite due to the unique electronic configuration at each facet which were further estimated by dft calculations text s3 the results showed that the ecbm of various valentinite facets especially 010 and 110 6 31 and 4 90 ev respectively were more negative than that of senarmontite 4 15 ev fig s13 thus the es of mn ii mn iii ox redox couples were substantially higher than the ecbm of valentinite facets 010 and 110 in the mn ii concentration ranges currently investigated while the energy difference of es of mn ii mn iv ox redox couples and ecbm of valentinite facets were smaller therefore sb2o3 surface enabled electron to spontaneously transfer from mn ii to o2 through the conduction band especially facets 010 and 110 of valentinite and mn iii ox rather than mn iv ox was preferentially formed which was consistent with xps results of mn together both the interfacial catalytic pathway and electrochemical pathway contributed to the oxidation of mn ii in the presence of sb2o3 and the processes were significantly facet dependent however once mnox was generated and coated on the sb2o3 mineral surface the catalytic sites would be gradually occupied by mnox due to its amorphous nature and large surface area which is often two orders of magnitudes greater than sb2o3 sun et al 2018 meanwhile mnox produced by oxidation of mn ii can be reduced by sb iii or sb2o3 minerals during which the mn ii was recycled and thus delayed the apparent consumption of mn ii fig s7 3 3 generation of mn iii during surface catalytic formation of mnox the oxidation of mn ii by do resulted in the formation of mn iii species which was believed to play an important role in sb iii oxidation and subsequent release of sb v therefore pp an efficient mn iii chelating agent was used to determine the underlying mechanism of mn iii and sb2o3 reactions qian et al 2019 the kinetic results in the presence of pp showed that when the ratio of pp to mn increased from 0 to 0 1 the rate of sbtot release was significantly decreased and sb v in the solution was more than 90 moreover the oxidative dissolution process of sb2o3 was completely inhibited when the ratio further increased to 1 fig 3 with the increasing ratio of pp to mn the removal rates of dissolved mn slowed down the dissolved mn iii pp complex was hypothesized to be generated under such conditions and is prone to disproportionate to mn ii and mn iv oxides at ph 9 klewicki and morgan 1998 qian et al 2019 which explained the slow decrease of the dissolved mn in this study however the solid mn oxides seemed to be redox inert to the dissolved sb iii and sb2o3 and currently this process is not fully understood previous studies have showed that pp can effectively promote dissolved as iii oxidation by mn iv oxide birnessite through chelating the surface mn iii precipitation due to the higher affinity and electron transfer rate between as iii and mn iv than mn iii ying et al 2020 however in this study mn iii species were considered as critical products in the oxidative dissolution of sb2o3 despite the lower ability of mn iii to oxidize sb iii than mn iv sun et al 2018 the continuous formation of mn iii ox could still provide a continuous thermodynamic driving force for the oxidative dissolution of sb2o3 therefore the addition of pp could chelate mn iii and inhibit the formation of mn iii ox terminating the oxidative dissolution process furthermore it is unlikely that pp affected the process through hindering mn ii oxidation given its much lower affinity to mn ii davies 1969 3 4 fate of sb during the mn catalyzed dissolution of sb2o3 by mn ii both liquid solid and solid solid reactions could happen between sb and mnox during the oxidative dissolution process the dissolved sb iii released from the equilibrium dissolution of sb2o3 was oxidized by the coated mnox liquid solid reaction recently we demonstrated that mn iv and mn iii on the edge sites of mnox were the key reactive mn species in both oxidation and adsorption of sb in solution the direct electron transfer occurred once dissolved sb iii adsorption inner sphere complexation to these reactive sites with generation and release of sb v and mn ii these sites were then partly blocked with sb v and mn ii during passivation process thus decreasing the rate constant of oxidation sun et al 2018 for solid solid reactions the physical proximity of valentinite senarmontite and mnox created locations where the reaction occurred predominately nevertheless electron transfers require enough orbital overlap which is more accessible in liquid solid reactions than in solid solid reactions ginder vogel et al 2010 alternatively as previously proposed the transient intermediates of two solids with high reactivity might have played a role within their close proximity liu et al 2002 wang et al 2013 the electron transfer between the intermediates could also lead to the ultimate production of sb v and mn ii at the interfaces of two minerals the sb on the remaining samples were further characterized by xps xanes and exafs because the surface sensitive xps characterization probes into the elemental speciation of the first 10 nm towards the interior of minerals it reflects the accumulation and redox states of sb on mnox surface thickness 20 nm wu et al 2019 the significant decrease of sb3d3 2 peak intensity as well as the atomic percentages of sb iii sb iii on the surface of solids only occurred with 0 5 and 5 mm mn ii addition at ph 9 fig s9b the evident oxidation of sb iii was observed as binding energy of sb 3d3 2 shifted to the higher energy 540 2 ev when the initial mn ii concentration increased from 0 05 to 0 5 mm and 5 mm at ph 9 miao et al 2014 suggested that the formation of the inner sphere surface complex of sb v on fe oxides increased the sb 3d3 2 peak to 540 4 ev as compared to bulk sb v minerals 539 6 ev thus the peak position of sb v in this study also indicated the formation of the possible sb o mn inner sphere complex on the mnox sun et al 2019 along with the surface characterization by xps the bulk structural characteristics of samples at atomic level were further explored by xanes and exafs spectra fig 4 and table s5 the normalized sb k edge xanes spectra and the edge positions of the two solid samples collected at day 7 in 0 5 and 5 mm mn ii treatments at ph 9 under oxic condition were showed in fig 4a the adsorption edges of two samples were between those of reference sb2o3 and ksb oh 6 and the adsorption edge of the sample with 5 mm mn ii addition shifted to higher energy these results indicated the bulk sb redox state was intermediate between iii and v and the higher mn ii addition increased the content of sb v in the solid sample sun et al 2019 wu et al 2019 which agreed with the kinetic experiment fig 1b and xps results fig s9b that more sb v was released and accumulated on the solid sample with 5 mm mn ii addition the shell by shell fitting results exhibited that the coordination numbers of sb o in the first shell were 4 6 and 5 1 respectively and the bond lengths were both 1 99 å the octahedrally coordinated sb v associated with 6 o atoms while the coordination number for trigonal pyramidally coordinated sb iii is 3 scheinost et al 2006 the coordination numbers of the sample in 5 mm mn ii treatment were slightly higher than those in 0 5 mm mn ii table s6 which also agreed with the xps and xanes results moreover the coordination of sb mn at about 3 5 å and sb sb at about 3 6 å were detected in the shell by shell fitting fig 4b and table s6 the presence of sb mn shell at 3 5 3 6 å strongly suggested the bidentate binuclear corner sharing complexes between the octahedron sbo6 of sb v and the octahedron mno6 unit of mnox which has also been observed with laboratory samples of sb v adsorption on birnessite sun et al 2019 and enrichment of sb on natural marine ferromanganese oxides qin et al 2019 3 5 proposed mechanism and verification with kinetic modeling according to the abovementioned supportive evidence mechanisms of the oxidative dissolution of sb2o3 mediated by abiotic mn redox cycling are proposed in graphic abstract firstly the dissolution equilibrium of valentinite and senarmontite was described in eqs 1 4 the surface catalytic mn ii oxidation by do could initially proceed via surface catalytic pathway or electrochemical pathway on the different sb2o3 valentinite and senarmontite facets eq 5 followed by imnox precipitation eq 6 imnox was assumed to be initially formed on the surface of sb2o3 and internal and accessible for reaction with sb2o3 while inaccessible to sb iii in solution then the catalytic sites were gradually occupied by the newly formed imnox and mn ii continuously adsorbed on imnox eq 7 and was oxidized to mnox eq 8 mnox was formed at the imnox solution interface which was assumed to be external and responsible for sb iii oxidation mnox underwent the passivation process by forming passivated mnox pmnox eq 9 sb iii was oxidized by mnox eq 10 and pmnox eq 11 via the liquid solid reactions respectively senarmontite and valentinite were oxidized by imnox solid solid reactions eqs 12 and 13 the oxidation product sb v could undergo adsorption desorption process on the surface of mnox eqs 14 and 15 the abovementioned reactions were summarized in table 1 and further verified by kinetic modeling generally the rate constants between the 3 different mn ii concentrations varied within 1 or 2 orders of magnitudes which was possibly due to the different reactivity of the formed mnox lan et al 2017 the sem and dft results in this study together with previous study biver and shotyk 2013 suggested a higher reactivity of valentinite than senarmontite as also indicated by the high rate constants of valentinite eqs 1 3 12 and 13 the rate constants of mn ii oxidation by do were ranged between 1 1 10 2 1 0 10 1 m 1s 1 with various mn ii additions in the presence of sb2o3 and higher than its absence 1 0 10 2 m 1s 1 table s3 eq 5 which consistent with catalytic mn ii oxidation on sb2o3 surface sensitivity analyses showed the large positive normalized sensitivity coefficients nscs of eq 5 at the 1st day of the whole reaction fig s14 suggesting the critical role of mn iii in the formation of sb v the rate constants of mnox precipitation eq 6 represented by imnox varied from 9 2 10 2 to 1 0 103 and 1 5 1014 m 1s 1 as mn ii concentration increased from 0 05 0 5 and 5 mm respectively similar variance was also observed with mn ii oxidation in the absence of sb2o3 table s3 eq s6 these can be explained that the precipitation process of mn ii involved sequential processes of hydrolysis polymer formation and aggregation on sb2o3 driven and accelerated by supersaturation of mn ii in solution as well as heterogeneous nucleation on the sb2o3 surface jung and jun 2015 therefore higher mn ii concentration induced the significantly higher rates of mnox precipitation the adsorption rate constants of mn ii on imnox heterogeneous oxidation eq 7 and pmnox passivation eq 9 in the presence of sb2o3 were lower than those in the absence of sb2o3 eq s7 which is likely due to the ion pair formation between the cation mn ii and the oxyanion sb v in the solution the calculated rate constant for the heterogeneous mn ii oxidation reaction eq 8 was approximately 1 order of magnitude greater than the homogeneous reaction or reaction on the surface of sb2o3 this is due to the much higher affinity of mn ii to imnox than sb2o3 and the inner sphere complexation favoring the electron transfer step between mn ii and do thermodynamically davies and morgan 1989 the active sites on mnox were partly covered with particle aggregation under high mn ii addition limiting the contact with sb iii and decreasing the rate constant eq 10 the pmnox was formed by the adsorption of mn ii on freshly formed mn iii oxides and could hinder the oxidation of sb iii sun et al 2019 which was also supported by the negative nscs of eq 9 that the passivation process significantly hindered the generation of sb v fig s14 the chemical kinetic model verified these coupled mechanisms while the differences between experimental observations and modeling indicated that certain processes were not included during model simplification the relatively large deviation occurred in modeling sb2o3 dissolution with 0 05 mm mn ii addition likely because sb iii or sb2o3 was oxidized by some active transient intermediates of mn species e g short lived mn iii intermediates after the surface catalysis wang et al 2014 and accelerated the release of mn ii which might be covered by significant precipitation process with high mn ii addition 0 5 and 5 mm 4 conclusions in this study the oxidative dissolution of sb2o3 was significantly promoted when different amount of mn ii was added at ph 9 under oxic condition respectively while such promoted dissolution was not observed at ph 7 and 8 or under anoxic condition at ph 7 9 amorphous mnox was formed through the surface catalytic mn ii oxidation by do on valentinite and senarmontite mn iii formation being the critical step mnox could oxidize the dissolved sb iii as well as solid sb2o3 which promoted sb2o3 dissolution valentinite showed higher activity in catalyzing mn ii oxidation and faster oxidative dissolution than senarmontite due to its higher surface energy and lower conduction band minimum of its exposed facets declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

16051,antimony trioxide sb2o3 is one of the primary forms of sb in the environment and its dissolution significantly impacts the migration and bioavailability of sb however the dissolution of sb2o3 coupled with abiotic redox of mn processes is unclear here we investigated the kinetics of sb2o3 dissolution in the presence of the ubiquitous mn ii by kinetic experiments spectroscopies density functional theory calculations and the chemical kinetic modeling the oxidative dissolution of sb2o3 was catalyzed by mn ii through the in situ generated amorphous mn oxides mnox under oxic conditions during which the generation of mn iii is a critical step in sb v release the released sb v was partially retained on mnox through bidentate binuclear corner sharing complexes as revealed by extended x ray absorption fine structure analysis the coexistent morphological forms of sb2o3 i e senarmontite and valentinite exhibited distinct dissolution patterns valentinite showed higher activity in catalyzing mn ii oxidation and faster oxidative dissolution than senarmontite due to its higher surface energy and lower conduction band minimum of its exposed facets these abiotic processes can extrapolate to other metal loid s hydr oxides further supplying for the comprehensive understanding of the redox transformation of mn graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords surface catalyzed oxidation oxidative dissolution kinetics chemical reaction model antimony trioxide manganese 1 introduction antimony sb is considered a priority pollutant by the united states environmental protection agency and its oxides sb2o3 is classified as possible carcinogens by the international agency for research on cancer filella et al 2009b international agency for research on cancer world health organization 2022 sb2o3 is one of the primary forms of sb in the environment enriched in sediments and soils via anthropogenic activities filella et al 2009a hu et al 2014 as well as microbial dissimilatory reduction abin and hollibaugh 2014 lai et al 2016 yamamura et al 2021 the dissolution of sb2o3 can profoundly alter mobility and bioavailability of sb and such process can be significantly accelerated by organic ligands increasing temperature and visible radiation hu and he 2017 hu et al 2014 zotov et al 2003 the coupling sb iii oxidation after its release into water or sediment environments affects the geochemical fate of sb oorts et al 2008 which generates more soluble and mobile sb v oxyanions and could further elevate the potential risk of sb migration mn oxides coexist with sb and significantly control sb redox transformation and solubility in sediments chen et al 2003 doherty et al 2021 under oxygen deficient conditions mn oxides were largely dissolved and released mn ii and pre adsorbed sb which could be subsequently reduced to dissolved sb iii or solid sb2o3 through the microbial dissimilatory process lai et al 2016 yamamura et al 2021 on the other hand mn ii could be oxidized back to mn oxides in sediments when water table dropped with the infiltration of air homoncik et al 2010 williams and oostrom 2000 these mn oxides mainly contributed to the oxidation of dissolved sb iii sun et al 2019 2018 wang et al 2012 recent finding has also suggested that an elevated dissolution potential could arise from the oxidative dissolution of sb2o3 minerals when encountered with mn oxides shan et al 2020 however such dissolution process slowed down with prolonged reaction time shan et al 2020 and similar kinetic patterns have also been observed in cases of uo2 and cr iii minerals pan et al 2019 qian et al 2020 wang et al 2013 the surface passivation along with the mn oxides depletion was suggested as the possible mechanism that hindered the dissolution kinetics however during the oxidation process of mn ii in realistic redox transition zones the in situ generation of mn oxides can provide a continuous thermodynamic driving force for the dissolution reaction of metal loid minerals including sb2o3 the abiotic mn ii oxidation by dissolved oxygen do dominates under neutral and alkaline conditions especially in the presence of solid surfaces the surface catalyzed mn ii oxidation occurred in goethite hematite ferrihydrite lepidocrocite silica and alumina suspensions by electron transfer from surface complexes or through electrochemical pathway davies and morgan 1989 inoue et al 2019 lan et al 2017 meanwhile the reactive mn species could be also produced from the reactions between mn ii and the surface of metal loid minerals and were believed to continuously drive the oxidative dissolution of u iv or cr iii minerals into dissolved u vi or cr vi namgung et al 2014 wang et al 2014 recently a facet dependent oxidation of mn ii on hematite indicated the facets containing highly reactive binding sites could induce distinct nucleation and growth behaviors of mn oxides liu et al 2021 furthermore the intrinsic property of exposed facets on metal loid minerals could also alter the surface reactivity exhibiting facet dependent dissolution or oxidation process of minerals including pyrite and cadmium sulfide huang et al 2021 zhu et al 2018 senarmontite and valentinite are the principal morphologic forms of sb2o3 with different exposed facets biver and shotyk 2013 and are the main secondary minerals in soils and sediments nearby some sb mining sites roper et al 2012 with typical ambient ph above 8 due to the coexistence of calcite and dolomite filella et al 2009a however to date little attention has been paid on mn ii oxidation on their exposed facets and their subsequent effect on sb mobilization under alkaline conditions here the reaction mechanisms of complex heterogeneous processes involving simultaneous surface catalyzed oxidative precipitation of mn oxides and dissolution of metal loid minerals are evaluated systematically by molecular spectroscopies and elementary kinetic modeling the primary objectives of this study are i to access the critical step in the coupled process of mn redox cycling and sb2o3 oxidative dissolution ii to evaluate surface effect on the dissolution of valentinite and senarmontite as well as mn ii oxidation by density functional theory dft calculations iii to apply chemical kinetic modeling in describing the proposed mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical reagents the details of the chemical reagents used in this study can be found by referring to text s1 2 2 sb2o3 dissolution kinetic experiments the sb2o3 dissolution kinetic experiments were conducted in screw top 40 ml amber vials to avoid photo induced processes which affected sb2o3 oxidation dissolution hu et al 2014 and mn redox cycling learman et al 2011 by generating reactive oxygen species aliquots of 25 ml sb2o3 suspensions 1 166 g l 1 in 50 mm kno3 were buffered with 50 mm mops ph 7 and ph 8 or ches ph 9 namgung et al 2014 various mn ii stock solution volumes were pipetted into the vials to make the mn ii initial concentrations of 0 0 05 0 5 and 5 mm to evaluate the potential involving of mn iii in the oxidative dissolution 0 5 and 5 mm pp were added to sb2o3 suspension with 5 mm mn ii addition at ph 9 all vials were placed on a reciprocating shaker 200 rpm in the dark at 25 2 c for 7 days an aliquot of suspension 1 ml was withdrawn at selected time intervals followed by vigorously shaken and filtered through 0 22 µm pes membranes after completion of the last sampling the residual solids were washed twice in water freeze dried transferred to aluminum foil wrapped tubes and stored in a desiccator an additional experiment was carried out inside an anoxic glovebox aw 400sg electrotek uk to evaluate the dissolved oxygen do effect on sb2o3 dissolution in the presence of mn ii this assay was followed the same procedure described above except gas purging for 1 h with n2 prior to the start of kinetic experiments 2 3 mn ii oxidation in the absence of sb2o3 to evaluate the aqueous mn ii oxidation by do same procedures were adopted as described above but in the absence of sb2o3 the solids were washed twice in water after 7 days freeze dried transferred to aluminum foil wrapped tubes and stored in a desiccator 2 4 analysis of dissolved metal concentrations and characterization of solid phases the dissolved sb and mn were determined by hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry and flame atomic adsorption spectrometry respectively phase identification and characterization of solid samples were conducted by x ray diffraction analysis xrd scanning electron microscope sem high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps sb k edge x ray absorption structure xas spectroscopies were conducted at the beamline bl14w1 of the shanghai synchrotron radiation facility ssrf in transmission mode the detailed methods can be found in text s2 2 5 dft calculations dft calculations were performed using the vienna ab initio simulation package vasp kresse and hafner 1993 detailed information is provided in text s3 2 6 kinetic modeling the collected kinetic data of the oxidative dissolution of sb2o3 and the dissolved mn ii were modeled using kintecus v6 50 ianni 2018 the reaction networks table 1 were set according to the proposed mechanisms in this study as well as previous reports shi et al 2018 van benschoten et al 1992 the dynamics of sb species and mn ii in solution were modeled simultaneously and sbtot was obtained by adding modeled sb iii and sb v concentrations sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the relative importance of each reaction for sb v generation based on the model output further information regarding model construction simplifications and assumptions can be referred to text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 oxidative dissolution of sb2o3 in the presence of mn ii the oxic sb2o3 dissolution experiments indicated that the release of dissolved sb was substantially promoted up to 1 2 3 3 and 12 folds as compared to that in the absence of aqueous mn ii with 30 7 75 4 and 90 6 of the total dissolved sb sbtot to be oxidized to sb v sb v when 0 05 0 5 and 5 mm of mn ii was added after 7 days at ph 9 respectively fig 1 no significant promotion of the sb2o3 dissolution or sb iii oxidation at ph 7 and 8 were observed in the presence of mn ii fig s5 in the absence of mn ii the equilibrium concentration of dissolved sb 30 μm was reached within 2 h and remained constant till day 7 in the ph range of 7 9 which agreed with previous study as the ph independent process was primarily limited by the solubility of sb2o3 fig 1a hu et al 2014 zotov et al 2003 under anoxic conditions sb2o3 dissolution reached a steady state within 1 day and no sb v was detected which were almost invariable regarding ph and the concentration of mn ii added fig s6 the dynamics of dissolved mn ii during sb2o3 dissolution were also analyzed the removal rates k obs of mn ii in the presence and absence of sb2o3 can be simplistically described by a pseudo first order rate law text s5 the k obs were 0 048 0 589 and 7 739 day 1 when initial mn ii addition increased from 0 05 to 0 5 to 5 mm respectively in the presence of sb2o3 at ph 9 under oxic condition fig s7 table s4 while no significant change was observed in mn ii concentration without do fig s8 however the k obs of mn ii removal in the absence of sb2o3 were 0 067 1 001 and 14 550 day 1 which were higher than in the presence of sb2o3 at ph 9 the observations were contradicted to the common understanding of catalytic oxidation of mn ii on the surface of metal oxides davies and morgan 1989 liu et al 2021 during which the removal rates should be accelerated by the presence of heterogeneous surface reaction indicating the likely involvement of an alternative redox mechanism on sb2o3 surface as discussed later to further explore the redox states of mnox on the surface of these solids at ph 9 the high resolution xps spectra of mn2p3 2 were obtained and conducted for peak fitting of mn ii mn iii and mn iv fig s9 table s5 the peak intensity of the 5 mm mn ii addition was higher than that of 0 5 mm addition indicating more mnox generated on sb2o3 alongside the higher mn ii addition the peak for mn 2p3 2 of 0 05 mm mn ii addition was negligible due to its low load on the mineral surface data not shown the peak fitting indicated mn iii became the dominant species on sb2o3 surface with its proportion increased from 59 51 to 77 08 while the proportion of mn ii on sb2o3 surface decreased from 23 81 to 11 14 when the addition of mn ii increased from 0 5 to 5 mm the changes in the remaining solid phase after sb2o3 dissolution experiments in the presence of mn ii at ph 7 9 were further identified by xrd and sem the xrd results indicated that the pristine commercial sb2o3 used in this study consisted of a mixture of two polymorphs valentinite and senarmontite fig s10 these two structures coexist ubiquitously in naturally occurring antimony oxides biver and shotyk 2013 after sb2o3 dissolution experiment no evident new peaks but a weak hump appeared in xrd spectra from around 15 2θ to 35 2θ with 5 mm mn ii addition at ph 9 which indicated the possible formation of amorphous mnox the relative amounts of valentinite valentinite and senarmontite senarmontite were estimated by the integral intensity of their xrd patterns the valentinite were 90 8 88 2 85 5 and 81 9 and senarmontite were 9 2 11 8 14 5 18 1 when the initial mn ii concentrations increased from 0 0 05 0 5 and 5 mm respectively the sem results indicated that senarmontite showed large octahedron shape with edge length of 2 μm and valentinite exhibited nanobelt shape with 1 μm in width and 0 2 μm in length either in dense bundles or in separate particles fig 2 a c in addition the number and size of valentinite particles significantly decreased with increasing mn ii addition fig 2a c these results together indicated valentinite was preferentially dissolved and consistent with previous studies biver and shotyk 2013 which may arise from their different morphologies size and surface reactivity and subsequent catalytic effect exerted on mn redox process 3 2 contribution of surface effects on sb2o3 dissolution and mn ii oxidation the combination of sem and hrtem revealed the morphologies and surface structures of the two sb2o3 polymorphs senarmontite exposed predominantly the equivalent facets of 111 as the lattice fringes of 0 32 and 0 28 nm spacings observed in hrtem image corresponded to 222 and 400 planes pereira et al 2012 zhang et al 2001 respectively fig 2d the orthogonal planes of 010 and 002 of valentinite were observed with 1 25 and 0 27 nm lattice fringe spacings respectively suggesting the particle were elongated along 100 direction with exposing side facets including 010 110 and a small fraction of 310 as well as base facet 002 fig 2e which were consistent with previous study vuković et al 2014 the surface energies of different sb2o3 facets were calculated by the dft method table s2 the 111 facets of face centered cubic senarmontite has a surface energy of 0 053 10 2 j m 2 being the most stable facet the 010 110 and 310 facets of orthorhombic valentinite have higher surface energy 6 197 2 266 and 10 081 10 2 j m 2 respectively than senarmontite the significant difference in surface energies of different facets of valentinite and senarmontite hinted that distinct thermodynamic reaction potentials would be expected for different sb2o3 phases as results of the differences in morphology and facets beside particle size from a theoretical perspective it supported the above findings from kinetic experiments as well as previous study that valentinite is a comparatively metastable phase biver and shotyk 2013 a further examination of the hrtem images figs 2d e s11 showed that significant amorphous phases were formed on the surface of sb2o3 during the dissolution reaction in the presence of 0 05 or 0 5 mm mn ii under oxic condition at ph 9 line scan and mapping results of tem and sem spectra indicated the generation of amorphous mnox was more evident with higher mn ii addition figs 2f s12 which agreed with the solution chemistry and the xps results therefore based on the aforementioned observations and literature reports the reaction of mn ii oxidation was assumed to proceed via interfacial catalytic pathway or electrochemical pathway both pathways were further examined by theoretical calculations for the interfacial catalytic pathway facets 010 110 and 310 of valentinite with higher surface energies than facet 111 of senarmontite table s2 are more reactive and thus should facilitate the adsorption of mn ii and o2 promoting mn ii oxidation by increasing their local concentrations lan et al 2017 luo et al 2020 furthermore these high surface energy facets may be also prone to stabilize the transient product between mn ii and o2 lowering the activation energy for the electron transfer between them davies and morgan 1989 for the electrochemical pathway it was reported that the difference between the absolute energy of electrons es in suspension and the absolute energy of the conduction band minimum ecbm for semiconductor was crucial in determining mn ii oxidation if the es in suspension is higher than ecbm for minerals electrons can flow from mn ii to minerals without contact with each other lan et al 2017 in this study the es of the hypothetical mn ii mn iii ox redox couples are 4 61 4 55 and 4 49 ev at 0 05 0 5 and 5 mm mn ii respectively the corresponding es of the mn ii mn iv ox redox couples are 4 73 4 71 and 4 68 ev respectively the experimentally determined ecbm for bulk sb2o3 is 4 82 ev xu and schoonen 2000 while different band structures especially conduction band edges would be expected for the different exposed facets of valentinite and senarmontite due to the unique electronic configuration at each facet which were further estimated by dft calculations text s3 the results showed that the ecbm of various valentinite facets especially 010 and 110 6 31 and 4 90 ev respectively were more negative than that of senarmontite 4 15 ev fig s13 thus the es of mn ii mn iii ox redox couples were substantially higher than the ecbm of valentinite facets 010 and 110 in the mn ii concentration ranges currently investigated while the energy difference of es of mn ii mn iv ox redox couples and ecbm of valentinite facets were smaller therefore sb2o3 surface enabled electron to spontaneously transfer from mn ii to o2 through the conduction band especially facets 010 and 110 of valentinite and mn iii ox rather than mn iv ox was preferentially formed which was consistent with xps results of mn together both the interfacial catalytic pathway and electrochemical pathway contributed to the oxidation of mn ii in the presence of sb2o3 and the processes were significantly facet dependent however once mnox was generated and coated on the sb2o3 mineral surface the catalytic sites would be gradually occupied by mnox due to its amorphous nature and large surface area which is often two orders of magnitudes greater than sb2o3 sun et al 2018 meanwhile mnox produced by oxidation of mn ii can be reduced by sb iii or sb2o3 minerals during which the mn ii was recycled and thus delayed the apparent consumption of mn ii fig s7 3 3 generation of mn iii during surface catalytic formation of mnox the oxidation of mn ii by do resulted in the formation of mn iii species which was believed to play an important role in sb iii oxidation and subsequent release of sb v therefore pp an efficient mn iii chelating agent was used to determine the underlying mechanism of mn iii and sb2o3 reactions qian et al 2019 the kinetic results in the presence of pp showed that when the ratio of pp to mn increased from 0 to 0 1 the rate of sbtot release was significantly decreased and sb v in the solution was more than 90 moreover the oxidative dissolution process of sb2o3 was completely inhibited when the ratio further increased to 1 fig 3 with the increasing ratio of pp to mn the removal rates of dissolved mn slowed down the dissolved mn iii pp complex was hypothesized to be generated under such conditions and is prone to disproportionate to mn ii and mn iv oxides at ph 9 klewicki and morgan 1998 qian et al 2019 which explained the slow decrease of the dissolved mn in this study however the solid mn oxides seemed to be redox inert to the dissolved sb iii and sb2o3 and currently this process is not fully understood previous studies have showed that pp can effectively promote dissolved as iii oxidation by mn iv oxide birnessite through chelating the surface mn iii precipitation due to the higher affinity and electron transfer rate between as iii and mn iv than mn iii ying et al 2020 however in this study mn iii species were considered as critical products in the oxidative dissolution of sb2o3 despite the lower ability of mn iii to oxidize sb iii than mn iv sun et al 2018 the continuous formation of mn iii ox could still provide a continuous thermodynamic driving force for the oxidative dissolution of sb2o3 therefore the addition of pp could chelate mn iii and inhibit the formation of mn iii ox terminating the oxidative dissolution process furthermore it is unlikely that pp affected the process through hindering mn ii oxidation given its much lower affinity to mn ii davies 1969 3 4 fate of sb during the mn catalyzed dissolution of sb2o3 by mn ii both liquid solid and solid solid reactions could happen between sb and mnox during the oxidative dissolution process the dissolved sb iii released from the equilibrium dissolution of sb2o3 was oxidized by the coated mnox liquid solid reaction recently we demonstrated that mn iv and mn iii on the edge sites of mnox were the key reactive mn species in both oxidation and adsorption of sb in solution the direct electron transfer occurred once dissolved sb iii adsorption inner sphere complexation to these reactive sites with generation and release of sb v and mn ii these sites were then partly blocked with sb v and mn ii during passivation process thus decreasing the rate constant of oxidation sun et al 2018 for solid solid reactions the physical proximity of valentinite senarmontite and mnox created locations where the reaction occurred predominately nevertheless electron transfers require enough orbital overlap which is more accessible in liquid solid reactions than in solid solid reactions ginder vogel et al 2010 alternatively as previously proposed the transient intermediates of two solids with high reactivity might have played a role within their close proximity liu et al 2002 wang et al 2013 the electron transfer between the intermediates could also lead to the ultimate production of sb v and mn ii at the interfaces of two minerals the sb on the remaining samples were further characterized by xps xanes and exafs because the surface sensitive xps characterization probes into the elemental speciation of the first 10 nm towards the interior of minerals it reflects the accumulation and redox states of sb on mnox surface thickness 20 nm wu et al 2019 the significant decrease of sb3d3 2 peak intensity as well as the atomic percentages of sb iii sb iii on the surface of solids only occurred with 0 5 and 5 mm mn ii addition at ph 9 fig s9b the evident oxidation of sb iii was observed as binding energy of sb 3d3 2 shifted to the higher energy 540 2 ev when the initial mn ii concentration increased from 0 05 to 0 5 mm and 5 mm at ph 9 miao et al 2014 suggested that the formation of the inner sphere surface complex of sb v on fe oxides increased the sb 3d3 2 peak to 540 4 ev as compared to bulk sb v minerals 539 6 ev thus the peak position of sb v in this study also indicated the formation of the possible sb o mn inner sphere complex on the mnox sun et al 2019 along with the surface characterization by xps the bulk structural characteristics of samples at atomic level were further explored by xanes and exafs spectra fig 4 and table s5 the normalized sb k edge xanes spectra and the edge positions of the two solid samples collected at day 7 in 0 5 and 5 mm mn ii treatments at ph 9 under oxic condition were showed in fig 4a the adsorption edges of two samples were between those of reference sb2o3 and ksb oh 6 and the adsorption edge of the sample with 5 mm mn ii addition shifted to higher energy these results indicated the bulk sb redox state was intermediate between iii and v and the higher mn ii addition increased the content of sb v in the solid sample sun et al 2019 wu et al 2019 which agreed with the kinetic experiment fig 1b and xps results fig s9b that more sb v was released and accumulated on the solid sample with 5 mm mn ii addition the shell by shell fitting results exhibited that the coordination numbers of sb o in the first shell were 4 6 and 5 1 respectively and the bond lengths were both 1 99 å the octahedrally coordinated sb v associated with 6 o atoms while the coordination number for trigonal pyramidally coordinated sb iii is 3 scheinost et al 2006 the coordination numbers of the sample in 5 mm mn ii treatment were slightly higher than those in 0 5 mm mn ii table s6 which also agreed with the xps and xanes results moreover the coordination of sb mn at about 3 5 å and sb sb at about 3 6 å were detected in the shell by shell fitting fig 4b and table s6 the presence of sb mn shell at 3 5 3 6 å strongly suggested the bidentate binuclear corner sharing complexes between the octahedron sbo6 of sb v and the octahedron mno6 unit of mnox which has also been observed with laboratory samples of sb v adsorption on birnessite sun et al 2019 and enrichment of sb on natural marine ferromanganese oxides qin et al 2019 3 5 proposed mechanism and verification with kinetic modeling according to the abovementioned supportive evidence mechanisms of the oxidative dissolution of sb2o3 mediated by abiotic mn redox cycling are proposed in graphic abstract firstly the dissolution equilibrium of valentinite and senarmontite was described in eqs 1 4 the surface catalytic mn ii oxidation by do could initially proceed via surface catalytic pathway or electrochemical pathway on the different sb2o3 valentinite and senarmontite facets eq 5 followed by imnox precipitation eq 6 imnox was assumed to be initially formed on the surface of sb2o3 and internal and accessible for reaction with sb2o3 while inaccessible to sb iii in solution then the catalytic sites were gradually occupied by the newly formed imnox and mn ii continuously adsorbed on imnox eq 7 and was oxidized to mnox eq 8 mnox was formed at the imnox solution interface which was assumed to be external and responsible for sb iii oxidation mnox underwent the passivation process by forming passivated mnox pmnox eq 9 sb iii was oxidized by mnox eq 10 and pmnox eq 11 via the liquid solid reactions respectively senarmontite and valentinite were oxidized by imnox solid solid reactions eqs 12 and 13 the oxidation product sb v could undergo adsorption desorption process on the surface of mnox eqs 14 and 15 the abovementioned reactions were summarized in table 1 and further verified by kinetic modeling generally the rate constants between the 3 different mn ii concentrations varied within 1 or 2 orders of magnitudes which was possibly due to the different reactivity of the formed mnox lan et al 2017 the sem and dft results in this study together with previous study biver and shotyk 2013 suggested a higher reactivity of valentinite than senarmontite as also indicated by the high rate constants of valentinite eqs 1 3 12 and 13 the rate constants of mn ii oxidation by do were ranged between 1 1 10 2 1 0 10 1 m 1s 1 with various mn ii additions in the presence of sb2o3 and higher than its absence 1 0 10 2 m 1s 1 table s3 eq 5 which consistent with catalytic mn ii oxidation on sb2o3 surface sensitivity analyses showed the large positive normalized sensitivity coefficients nscs of eq 5 at the 1st day of the whole reaction fig s14 suggesting the critical role of mn iii in the formation of sb v the rate constants of mnox precipitation eq 6 represented by imnox varied from 9 2 10 2 to 1 0 103 and 1 5 1014 m 1s 1 as mn ii concentration increased from 0 05 0 5 and 5 mm respectively similar variance was also observed with mn ii oxidation in the absence of sb2o3 table s3 eq s6 these can be explained that the precipitation process of mn ii involved sequential processes of hydrolysis polymer formation and aggregation on sb2o3 driven and accelerated by supersaturation of mn ii in solution as well as heterogeneous nucleation on the sb2o3 surface jung and jun 2015 therefore higher mn ii concentration induced the significantly higher rates of mnox precipitation the adsorption rate constants of mn ii on imnox heterogeneous oxidation eq 7 and pmnox passivation eq 9 in the presence of sb2o3 were lower than those in the absence of sb2o3 eq s7 which is likely due to the ion pair formation between the cation mn ii and the oxyanion sb v in the solution the calculated rate constant for the heterogeneous mn ii oxidation reaction eq 8 was approximately 1 order of magnitude greater than the homogeneous reaction or reaction on the surface of sb2o3 this is due to the much higher affinity of mn ii to imnox than sb2o3 and the inner sphere complexation favoring the electron transfer step between mn ii and do thermodynamically davies and morgan 1989 the active sites on mnox were partly covered with particle aggregation under high mn ii addition limiting the contact with sb iii and decreasing the rate constant eq 10 the pmnox was formed by the adsorption of mn ii on freshly formed mn iii oxides and could hinder the oxidation of sb iii sun et al 2019 which was also supported by the negative nscs of eq 9 that the passivation process significantly hindered the generation of sb v fig s14 the chemical kinetic model verified these coupled mechanisms while the differences between experimental observations and modeling indicated that certain processes were not included during model simplification the relatively large deviation occurred in modeling sb2o3 dissolution with 0 05 mm mn ii addition likely because sb iii or sb2o3 was oxidized by some active transient intermediates of mn species e g short lived mn iii intermediates after the surface catalysis wang et al 2014 and accelerated the release of mn ii which might be covered by significant precipitation process with high mn ii addition 0 5 and 5 mm 4 conclusions in this study the oxidative dissolution of sb2o3 was significantly promoted when different amount of mn ii was added at ph 9 under oxic condition respectively while such promoted dissolution was not observed at ph 7 and 8 or under anoxic condition at ph 7 9 amorphous mnox was formed through the surface catalytic mn ii oxidation by do on valentinite and senarmontite mn iii formation being the critical step mnox could oxidize the dissolved sb iii as well as solid sb2o3 which promoted sb2o3 dissolution valentinite showed higher activity in catalyzing mn ii oxidation and faster oxidative dissolution than senarmontite due to its higher surface energy and lower conduction band minimum of its exposed facets declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

16052,chlorine dioxide clo2 is commonly used as an alternative disinfectant to chlorine because it has a high bactericidal effect and may produce limited concentrations of halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps however previous studies have reported that free available chlorine fac was produced when clo2 reacted with some compounds such as phenol leading to the formation of halogenated dbps in this study aliphatic amines was found to react rapidly with clo2 to form significant amount of fac and its related dbps this study investigated the formation of fac when clo2 reacts with six model aliphatic amines including primary amines secondary amines and tertiary amines fac was formed immediately as clo2 was added to the precursor solution the maximum yield of fac even reached 45 based on consumed clo2 when clo2 reacted with 20 μm methylamine at a dose of 10 μm which is close to a realistic maximum dose about 0 8 mg l in the u s the reactivity of amines to result fac follows the sequence tertiary amines secondary amines primary amines it was verified that the addition of aliphatic amines may enhance the formation of fac during clo2 oxidation in actual water samples organic chloramines and other chlorinated dbps such as cyanogen chloride were detected when clo2 was used as the sole oxidant of real water samples this study demonstrated that chlorine related byproducts may also be formed in the presence of organic amines during clo2 treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chlorine dioxide aliphatic amines free available chlorine membrane introduction mass spectrometry disinfection byproducts 1 introduction although chlorine is the most commonly used disinfectant in water treatment the formation of a large amount of disinfection byproducts dbps has caused wide concern because of their potential toxicity to human health du et al 2017 luo et al 2020 watson et al 2012 zhong et al 2019 more than 600 dbps have been discovered thus far luo et al 2020 stalter et al 2016 chlorine dioxide clo2 was used as an alternative disinfectant to chlorine since it produces much less regulated halogenated dbps shmeis et al 2009 li et al 1996 padhi et al 2019 vertova et al 2019 the primary dbps of clo2 are chlorite clo2 50 70 and chlorate clo3 0 30 and limited halogenated dbps yang et al 2021 it also has a high bactericidal effect over a wide ph range luo et al 2020 wen et al 2017 in addition clo2 can effectively control the taste and odor of source water by oxidizing iron and manganese into insoluble forms and removing them by filtration chen et al 2016 for these reasons clo2 has been widely used in public water systems as a pre oxidant or disinfectant wang et al 2012 ye et al 2019 although extensive research has been conducted to understand the reaction of clo2 in aqueous matrices only a few studies have focused on the formation of fac during this process it has been reported that hypochlorous acid hocl is formed during the clo2 disinfection process gan et al 2020 ravacha et al 1986 wajon et al 1982 phenols are one of the abundant moieties and react with clo2 to form hocl gan et al 2020 the mechanism involves one electron transfer followed by rapid decay of the phenoxyl oclo adduct as an intermediate rouge et al 2018 wajon et al 1982 in addition hocl can also be released when clo2 reacts with unsaturated olefins sulfur containing compounds aniline and some amino acids gan et al 2020 in general one electron is transferred from organic molecules to clo2 and the organic molecules are converted to free radicals then the free radicals will combine with oxygen atom of clo2 and release hocl gan et al 2020 wajon et al 1982 as a result chlorine related dbps may also be formed from the reaction of clo2 according to a previous study under drinking water treatment conditions clo2 degradation induces the in situ formation of free available chlorine fac including hocl ocl and cl2 resulting in the formation of substantial levels of halogenated dbps rouge et al 2018 studies have shown that a significant reduction in ndma formation was observed in the clo2 oxidation of amines gan et al 2015 lee et al 2007a uzun et al 2018 amines are considered the main precursors of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma during chlorination ndma has attracted much attention due to its high mutagenicity carcinogenicity and frequent detection andrzejewski and nawrocki 2009 uzun et al 2018 amines are widely present in the environment and have many natural and industrial sources methylamine ma dimethylamine dma ethylamine ea and diethylamine dea are the most commonly detected amines in surface water and the total concentration of them can even reach 139 μg l poste et al 2014 secondary amines including dma 0 79 0 88 μg l or 0 018 0 020 μm and dea 0 38 0 24 μg l or 0 0052 0 0033 μm were detected in groundwater and dma 1 78 1 51 μg l or 0 0396 0 0336 μm and dea 0 54 0 29 μg l or 0 0074 0 0040 μm were detected in river water in jialu river basin china ma et al 2012 the mechanism of aliphatic amines and clo2 reaction is shown as scheme s1 gan et al 2020 hull et al 1967 in the reaction tertiary amines were oxidized to secondary amines and clo2 was transformed to clo2 no hocl was detected rosenblatt et al 1967 however it has been reported that volatile organic chloramines including n chlorodimethylamine ch3 2ncl and dichloromethylamine ch3ncl2 were formed during the reaction of clo2 and some organic amine dye pollutants hu et al 2020 since ch3 2ncl and ch3ncl2 are the dominant volatile dbps during chlorination of these dye pollutants e et al 2019 guo et al 2021 fac resulting from the reaction of clo2 and organic amine dye pollutants may be the key to the formation of halogenated organic amines however due to the complex structure of organic amine dyes the mechanism of fac formation remains uncertain the preliminary results showed that ch3 2ncl was also formed during the reaction of clo2 and dimethylamine the results suggested that fac may be formed in the presence of clo2 and organic aliphatic amines the objective of the present study is to investigate the formation of fac resulting from the reaction of organic amines and clo2 to simplify the reaction six organic aliphatic amines with the simplest structure ma dma trimethylamine tma ea dea and triethylamine tea were selected as the model compounds fig s1 si 15nh4cl combined with membrane introduction mass spectrometry mims was employed to determine fac by analyzing the mass peak at m z 52 15nh2cl a possible reaction pathway of the release of fac in the reaction of clo2 with aliphatic amines was proposed additionally the influence of aliphatic amines on fac formation and related halo dbps in natural water were also examined 2 material and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals used in this study unless otherwise noted were purchased as reagent grade chemicals from j k scientific sodium hydrogen phosphate potassium dihydrogen phosphate sodium chlorite 80 and ma were purchased from alfa aesar dpd n n diethyl p phenylenediamine was purchased from acros organics dma 33 aqueous was purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd more detailed information about the main chemicals was showed in table s1 all solutions were used without further purification and prepared in distilled deionized water 2 2 experimental procedures clo2 stock solution was prepared by mixing 5 g sodium chlorite powder and 5 g sodium bisulfate monohydrate powder into 250 ml water sequentially in a 250 ml sealed glass bottle for two h hu et al 2020 ye et al 2013 the stock solution was kept in the dark at 4 c the concentration of clo2 stock solution was analysed by dpd fas titration it shows a signal as fac and 0 2 g glycine was added to 100 ml of sample to quench free chlorine before the titration apha 1998 all experiments in this study unless otherwise noted used 0 01 m phosphate buffer to achieve a ph of 7 0 solutions of aliphatic amine precursors were prepared at an initial concentration of 20 μm clo2 was added at clo2 precursor clo2 p molar ratios of 0 2 0 5 1 0 2 0 and 4 0 the experiment was carried out in an air tight 100 ml glass bottle unless otherwise noted the sampling reaction time was 8 h for tma and tea the sampling reaction time was 60 min the reaction solutions were protected from light at room temperature 10 ml sample was taken by a pipette into a 10 ml tube for detection and each experiment was sampled for 5 7 times in 8 h or monitored continuously for 60 min it has been verified that the increase of headspace during the reaction had little influence on the loss of clo2 the ph of the solution was adjusted by adding naoh or hcl 1 m rouge et al 2018 for fac quantification as previous studies reported nh4cl could be an appropriate fac quencher resulting in nh2cl as the product hu et al 2020 rouge et al 2018 mims is an optimized analytical method for measuring nh2cl li and blatchley 2009 however as shown in fig s2a and s2b the characteristic peaks of clo2 and nh2cl overlapped at m z 51 in the mass spectrum this would lead to a large error in the quantitative calculation therefore 15n labeled nh4cl was selected in this study to quench fac to 15nh2cl the mass spectrum of 15nh2cl was shown in fig s2c the characteristic peak at m z 52 was used for the quantitative calculation of 15nh2cl although nh4cl reacts significantly fast with fac k 2 7 104 m 1 s 1 rouge et al 2018 the formation of chloramines cannot be avoided because the reaction between fac and organic aliphatic amines such as dma is also fast k 8 9 103 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 0 deborde and von gunten 2008 excess 15nh4cl was used to ensure that fac was translated to 15nh2cl instead of organic chloramines approximately 200 μm 15n labeled nh4cl 10 times the concentration of precursors was added to the aqueous solution at the beginning of the reaction the content of organic chloramines was less than 5 when 15nh4cl was added to this system as a result the fac formed in this system was represented by the formation of 15nh2cl in the following descriptions unless otherwise noted fac in clo2 stock solution was transformed to 15nh2cl and measured by mims the result showed that there was approximate 0 28 μm free chlorine existed in 20 μm clo2 stock solution all the fac data have been modified by deducting the free chlorine in clo2 solution to investigate the formation of fac during the oxidation of aliphatic amines with clo2 in the actual water environment four natural water samples and tap water were collected in 600 ml bottles with screw caps from different locations in henan and beijing china the water samples were kept in frozen conditions and analyzed within 6 months experiments were conducted in the presence and absence of 20 μm dma which was selected as the model aliphatic amine precursor 15n labeled nh4cl was added to natural water samples to assess the formation potential of fac 2 3 analytical methods free chlorine stock solution was measured by uv absorbance at 292 nm εocl 350 m 1 cm 1 25 c and ph 9 5 lian et al 2014 mims combined with dpd fas titration was used to measure the concentrations of clo2 15nh2cl and other volatile dbps in this research guo et al 2021 lee et al 2007b li and blatchley 2007 the mims system used in this research was based on a modification of a shimadzu gc ms qp2010 mass spectrum scan mode 50 m z 200 and selected ion monitoring coupled with ei were used to identify and quantify possible dbps li and blatchley 2007 shang and blatchley 1999 other details of the configuration and setup for the mims system and operational conditions can be obtained from a previous study shang and blatchley 1999 the mass to charge ratios m z of the molecular ions at m z 52 61 67 and 78 were used to quantify 15nh2cl cyanogen chloride cncl clo2 and ch3 2ncl respectively it was verified that 15nh4cl does not react with clo2 fig s3 the limit of detection lod was listed in table s2 cl clo2 clo3 no3 and no2 were measured using a dionex ics 600 ion chromatographic ic system waltham usa with a 4 5 mm na2co3 0 8 mm nahco3 eluent at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 and a 50 μl sample injection loop the column was dionex ionpac as23 4 250 mm thermo scientific the samples were purged with nitrogen for 30 min to remove the residual clo2 thoroughly before ic analysis the lod of these anions was listed in table s3 all compound identifications by mims or ic were confirmed by analysis of standard solutions the molar yields of fac were calculated by dividing the concentration of fac by the amount of clo2 consumed following eq 1 1 fac yield fac formed μ m cl o 2 consumed μ m 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 formation of chloramines from reactions of clo2 and dma dbps and clo2 were monitored by mims during the reaction of clo2 and dma at a clo2 p molar ratio of 0 5 ch3 2ncl was identified as the major volatile dbp as shown in fig 1 the concentration of ch3 2ncl increased with the reaction time and reached 0 24 μm after 8 h as a previous study reported ch3 2ncl was produced during chlorination of dma guo et al 2021 however the tendency of ch3 2ncl formation in this study is different from that of dma chlorination during chlorination ch3 2ncl was formed immediately when chlorine was added and then decayed slightly at a low cl p ratio 1 0 and a small amount of ch3ncl2 was also formed at the same time guo et al 2021 in contrast during the reaction between clo2 and dma the concentration of ch3 2ncl increased with increasing reaction time and there was no tendency to decrease in 8 h overall the reaction between clo2 and dma follows pseudo second order reaction kinetics fig s4 no detectable ch3ncl2 was found to be formed in the reaction these results indicated that fac may form in situ during the reaction between dma and clo2 due to the low concentration of fac only ch3 2ncl generated in the system and ch3ncl2 cannot be formed 3 2 quantification of fac from reactions of clo2 with aliphatic amines to further prove that fac was formed from the reactions of clo2 with aliphatic amines 15n labeled nh4cl was employed to quench the in situ formed fac fig 2 shows the formation of fac and the consumption of clo2 as a function of time for the reaction between clo2 and model methyl amines at clo2 p ratio of 1 0 the rate constant of fac formation from ma and dma was 1 7 103 m 1 s 1 and 4 3 103 m 1 s 1 respectively then fac formation increased relatively slow after 3 h the results of the reaction of ethyl amines and clo2 were shown in fig s5 the data showed similar results with methyl amines the tendency of fac formation was similar to the reaction of clo2 with phenol or natural organic matter rouge et al 2018 however for tertiary amines tma and tea the concentration of fac decreased significantly after 30 min that may be due to the consumption of the fac indicator 15nh2cl reacting with other compounds in the reaction system the fac formation rate constant from tma was 4 4 103 m 1 s 1 dma showed the highest fac concentration of 1 3 μm approximately 17 based on consumed clo2 after 3 h while tma and tea showed the highest fac concentration of 0 4 μm at reaction time of 30 min the trend of clo2 consumption was tertiary amines secondary amines primary amines which is consistent with the literatures rosenblatt et al 1967 terhalle et al 2018 for secondary and primary amines although the formation of fac stabilized after one hour clo2 continued to be consumed it indicated that the formation of fac was only part of the reaction between amines and clo2 other reactions occurred in the reaction system at the same time and resulting in the consumption of clo2 it has been reported that the second order rate constant of clo2 and triethylamine is approximately 102 times faster than that of diethylamine rosenblatt et al 1963 for tertiary amines the consumption rate of clo2 was much faster than other amines and clo2 almost exhausted in 60 min in this system however the yield of fac was relatively low and decreased significantly after 30 min the results indicated that fac formation resulting from tertiary amines was different from primary and secondary amines in the reaction with clo2 before fac formed tertiary amines need to be converted to secondary amines and aldehyde by clo2 oxidation and the reaction rate is fast k 2 1 105 m 1 s 1 scheme s1 in addition clo2 was quickly consumed in the process due to the high reactivity of nh2cl with aldehyde k 2 8 0 1 104 m 1 s 1 nh2cl was likely to be consumed by the reaction with aldehyde resulting from tertiary amines and clo2 pedersen et al 1999 in addition nh2cl can also react with residual amines such as with dma to form ndma choi and valentine 2002 this is also a way to consume nh2cl as a result fac signals decreased in 30 min overall the formation of fac was observed in all the six aliphatic amine precursor cases it was confirmed that aliphatic amines have the potential to form fac during the clo2 oxidation in addition in situ formed fac may have the potential to generate halogenated dbps the conclusion can also explain the results of previous study on the formation of ch3 2ncl in the reaction between clo2 and organic dyes with dimethylamine functional group hu et al 2020 3 3 effect of clo2 doses on fac formation to assess the influence of different clo2 doses on the formation of fac six aliphatic amines were treated with clo2 at clo2 p ratio ranging from 0 2 to 4 0 fac was monitored by adding 15nh4cl to the reaction solution before adding clo2 the formation of fac in 8 h tma and tea in 30 min and maximum yields were shown in fig s6 and fig 3 respectively as shown in fig s6 the concentrations of fac produced in 8 h by clo2 and six aliphatic amines ranged from 0 2 μm to 2 3 μm and generally increased with the increasing of clo2 dose however when the dosage of clo2 was excessive the precursors might be more easily oxidized by other pathways and resulted in the decrease of fac for example the maximum fac concentration resulting from ea was 1 0 μm at clo2 p ratio 2 0 and decreased to less than 0 2 μm at clo2 p ratio 4 0 compared with other amines tertiary amines were shown to be less active to produce fac at different clo2 p ratio which is consistent with the results above the yields of fac were calculated based on the maximum concentrations of fac and consumed clo2 as shown in fig 3 the highest yields of fac were found at clo2 p ratio 0 5 in most of cases the reactivity of amines with clo2 to result fac follows the sequence tertiary amines secondary amines primary amines for methyl amines fig 3a ma showed the highest fac yield of 45 and then decreased to 5 as clo2 p ratio increased from 0 5 to 4 0 the results indicated that the pathway to produce fac was not dominated at high dose of clo2 p ratio in addition excess clo2 was likely to lead to other oxidation reactions in the system previous study has confirmed that although amine reaction has been completed clo2 continues to be consumed rosenblatt et al 1963 indicating that there are other reactions occurred in the system at the same time ethyl amines had the similar results to methyl amines fig 3b the highest fac yields were observed during the reaction of ea and clo2 at clo2 p ratio 0 5 these results suggested that ma or ea have similar reactivity with phenol when reacting with clo2 to form fac according to the literatures approximately 40 50 of fac was formed per mole of chlorine dioxide during the reaction between phenol and chlorine dioxide rouge et al 2018 terhalle et al 2018 3 4 formation of inorganic products the concentrations of clo2 clo3 and cl in 10 μm clo2 stock solution were measured by ic to be 0 31 μm 7 32 μm and 8 59 μm respectively they was relatively stable in 24 h given the high background of clo3 and cl in the system it is hard to distinguish them from clo2 and amine products on the other hand clo2 can be quantified because of its low background and high yield in the system the inorganic products clo2 and clo3 were measured in the reaction of dma and clo2 the results showed that there was no observable clo3 formed during this process as shown in fig s7a and s7b the rapid formation of clo2 and fac was observed at the beginning of the reaction to 1 h and then increased relatively slowly this trend was consistent with the consumption of clo2 fig s7c the concentrations of clo2 and fac were approximately 1 4 μm to 7 1 μm and 1 4 μm to 2 3 μm at the clo2 p ratio 0 5 to 2 0 respectively at clo2 p ratio 0 5 the concentration of fac was close to clo2 and the yield of fac based on consumed clo2 was approximately 45 as the dosages of clo2 increased the proportion of clo2 formation was increased compared with fac after 1 h the concentration of fac was reached an apparent plateau and tended to be stable however clo2 was still consumed with a relatively slow increase in the formation of clo2 these results indicate that the one electron transfer between the aliphatic amines and clo2 is a critical step in fac formation and the generated amine radicals combine with chlorine dioxide for further decomposition to generate fac the total concentration of clo2 and fac was calculated at 1 h as shown in fig s8 approximately 28 62 clo2 was formed within 1 h at clo2 p ratio 0 5 to 2 0 the yields of fac ranged from 15 to 30 the result was consistent with previous study that amines exhibited clo2 yields 50 at high clo2 p ratio the total concentration of clo2 and fac was accounting for 58 84 of the consumed clo2 the missing parts may be cl and clo3 it was reported that the yields of clo3 from clo2 oxidation of amines were below 10 and amines have the potential to further reduce clo2 to cl just like sulfur containing compounds gan et al 2019 it is likely cl and clo3 account for missing atomic chlorine recovery however high background in clo2 stock solution makes it difficult to quantify in addition considering the complexity of amines oxidation some chlorinated products may be produced in the reaction system no2 and no3 were also monitored at the same time however the results showed that neither no2 nor no3 was formed during this process it indicated that the nitrogen of aliphatic amine may stay in organic n 3 5 effect of ph on fac formation previous study has shown that the reaction rate of amines and clo2 increased with ph increasing from 4 70 to 7 11 rosenblatt et al 1963 to assess the influence of ph on the formation of fac during the reaction of amines and clo2 experiments were carried out at ph from 5 0 to 11 0 dma pka 10 73 0 10 was selected as model precursor to react with clo2 however the stability of nh2cl is highly correlated with ph and is easy to form and stabilize at alkaline condition soulard et al 1981 it is not appropriate to use it to study the ph effect of fac formation to avoid the problem ch3 2ncl was monitored as the unique volatile dbp in the absence of 15nh4cl as discussed above due to the complex clo2 oxidation reaction system a part of fac formed by dma and clo2 was likely to be lost and could not produce ch3 2ncl as a result the concentration of ch3 2ncl only represent part of fac formed in the system since different ph has little effect on ch3 2ncl formation in chlorination over a wide ph range 5 0 to 11 0 guo et al 2021 fig s9 ch3 2ncl is more suitable for evaluating the effect of ph on the formation of fac during the reaction of between dma and clo2 the effect of ph on the ch3 2ncl formation by the reaction of dma and clo2 was shown in fig 4 from ph 5 0 to 11 0 the maximum concentration of ch3 2ncl approximately 0 11 μm appeared at ph 6 0 and 11 0 respectively however the clo2 consumption was increased with the increasing of ph fig s10 these results confirmed that there were various reaction pathways in the reaction between dma and clo2 and the formation of fac was only one of them in addition the rate limiting step of the formation of fac from the reaction between dma and clo2 was ph related the reaction of clo2 and amines was accelerated under alkaline conditions and the formation of fac was also favorable at ph 6 0 these results suggest that the reaction of clo2 and amine and the release of fac may be two independent rate limiting steps in fac formation 3 6 fac formation pathways during oxidation of aliphatic amine with clo2 as described above clo2 was the dominant product of clo2 in the system indicating that one electron transfer pathway was the main reaction mechanism base on the results above a possible fac formation pathway was proposed in scheme 1 the primary step of this oxidation process involves one electron transfer between the aliphatic amines and clo2 to produce amine radical and clo2 then aliphatic amine oclo adduct is formed and decays rapidly in addition hocl release at the same time for primary aliphatic amines nitroso alkane was the additional product when r was a methyl group the product was to be nitrosomethane it would like to tautomerize to a more stable formaldehyde oxime long et al 2001 for secondary amines an intermediate oxoammonium salt was formed and it is a chemically active oxidant and even reacts with precursors and form dimethylhydroxylamine the process would lead to more consumption of the precursors this hypothesis was consistent with the results for the highest fac yields at clo2 p ratios of 0 5 or 0 2 fig 3 however due to the low concentration of dimethylhydroxylamine it was hardly detected it indicated that the oxidation of amines was miscellaneous and resulting in a very complex reaction system the hypothesis of fac formation mechanism is consistent with the result of ph as shown in fig 4 there are two favorable ph conditions for the formation of fac as described in scheme 1 under acidic conditions the release of hocl was accelerated considering the relatively favorable condition for ch3 2ncl formation was ph 7 0 it was reasonable that the maximum concentration of fac was found at ph 6 0 in addition it was reported that the apparent rate constants for clo2 oxidation of amine compounds generally increase with increasing ph because the deprotonated species are stronger electron donors lee et al 2007a as a result although the first step was not conductive to form hocl the electron transfer between the aliphatic amines and clo2 was enhanced at higher ph which may promote the release of hocl as a result higher concentration of ch3 2ncl was found to be formed at ph 11 0 these results indicated that removal of an electron from aliphatic amine by clo2 to form an amine radical and clo2 may be the rate limiting step for the formation of hocl which has been proved in the reaction of clo2 and phenol wajon et al 1982 3 7 formation of fac in natural water treatment by clo2 there is a wide range of amines compounds and many have been detected in the environment and are recognized as toxic organic pollutants forgacs et al 2004 guo et al 2021 wang et al 2011 to assess the influence of aliphatic amines on fac formation in environmental water four natural water samples and tap water collected were treated with 5 mg l clo2 the parameters of these water samples are listed in detail in table s4 however there are many impurities in all natural water systems and some of them could also react with clo2 and form hocl at the same time the function of aliphatic amines that may exist in natural waters is difficult to be identified dma is an important pollutant in wastewater that exists in primary effluent and typically ranges from 30 to 80 μg l mitch and sedlak 2004 therefore additional dma was added as model compound to the water samples since fac precursors may be present in high concentrations in real water samples 20 μm dma was chosen to spike in water samples to make the difference more pronounced fac was monitored by adding 15nh4cl the result was shown in fig 5 approximately 0 5 6 0 μm fac was formed in original water samples after oxidation by clo2 for 2 h while 1 0 6 1 μm fac was measured after 20 μm dma added it was obviously that the addition of dma increased the concentration of fac the concentration of fac in the oxidation process of tap water was even increased by 116 after 20 μm dma added this result verified that aliphatic amines have positive effect on fac formation in clo2 disinfection of natural water the volatile dbps were also measured by mims including trichloramine chloroform chcl3 dichloroacetonitrile dichloromethlyamine cncl and ch3 2ncl only cncl and ch3 2ncl were detected and the other products were all lower than lod it was because although a large amount of excess 15nh4cl was added to quench in situ formed fac there were still other chlorinated dbps generated due to the fast formation rate such as ch3 2ncl k 8 9 103 m 1 s 1 deborde and von gunten 2008 and cncl k 1 22 109 m 1 s 1 gerritsen and margerum 1990 the time course concentrations of fac cncl and ch3 2ncl resulting from tap water and water sample 3 were shown in fig s11 and s12 respectively the results showed that the addition of dma has a certain impact and increased the concentration and formation rate of fac in addition the consumption of clo2 was increased at the same time a large amount of ch3 2ncl were generated in addition to ch3 2ncl a small amount of cncl was also formed in the system as shown in fig s11 0 01 μm cncl was generated in first 4 h and then decreased below the detection limit at 8 h in tap water after dma was spiked in the water sample the formation of cncl was promoted slightly to 0 02 μm with no decreasing trend in 8 h in addition cncl formation was slightly decreased in the spiked water samples when the concentrations of dbps were high fig s12 it is because the precursors of cncl in the water sample need to compete with the relatively high concentration of dma for inadequate fac overall the addition of amines could increase the formation of fac and then increase the concentration of chlorinated dbps the formation of ch3 2ncl and cncl indicated that fac in situ formed in natural water samples was partially consumed it means that the fac concentration calculated was underestimated in addition studies have shown organic chloramines have high potential adverse effects on human health bull et al 2011 how et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 it is reported that ch3ncl2 has approximately three orders of magnitude more toxic than chcl3 e et al 2019 ch3 2ncl may also have high risk to human health cncl is a volatile and toxic asphyxiant that can affect multiple organs such as the central nervous cardiovascular and pulmonary systems abu soud et al 2012 the formation of these chlorinated dbps should be concerning during clo2 disinfection in the presence of amine precursors 4 conclusions this study demonstrates that aliphatic amines could form fac when react with clo2 it is a new type of precursors with potential to form fac in clo2 oxidation aliphatic amines similar as phenol can quickly react with clo2 to form fac and up to 45 of clo2 can be converted to fac at low clo2 p ratios in addition organic chloramines and other dbps can also be formed during this process experiments in real waters showed that the presence of aliphatic amines can promote the formation of fac in real water matrices because amines are ubiquitous in surface water they may make a contribution to the formation of fac when clo2 is used as a pre oxidant or disinfectant in water treatment plant the concentration of fac can be increased by 2 5 116 when 20 μm dma is present in natural water it will make the clo2 disinfection system more complicated although the yields of fac generated are relatively low during real water treatment large amounts of halogenated dbps such as cncl and ch3 2ncl may be formed during the clo2 treatment of certain amine containing wastewater as a result the fac formation potential of aliphatic amines should be of concern and need further study the results confirmed that in addition to amines with specific structures or functional groups there are some compounds that may react with clo2 to form fac the in situ formation of fac may be more than what we estimated in the clo2 oxidation systems

16052,chlorine dioxide clo2 is commonly used as an alternative disinfectant to chlorine because it has a high bactericidal effect and may produce limited concentrations of halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps however previous studies have reported that free available chlorine fac was produced when clo2 reacted with some compounds such as phenol leading to the formation of halogenated dbps in this study aliphatic amines was found to react rapidly with clo2 to form significant amount of fac and its related dbps this study investigated the formation of fac when clo2 reacts with six model aliphatic amines including primary amines secondary amines and tertiary amines fac was formed immediately as clo2 was added to the precursor solution the maximum yield of fac even reached 45 based on consumed clo2 when clo2 reacted with 20 μm methylamine at a dose of 10 μm which is close to a realistic maximum dose about 0 8 mg l in the u s the reactivity of amines to result fac follows the sequence tertiary amines secondary amines primary amines it was verified that the addition of aliphatic amines may enhance the formation of fac during clo2 oxidation in actual water samples organic chloramines and other chlorinated dbps such as cyanogen chloride were detected when clo2 was used as the sole oxidant of real water samples this study demonstrated that chlorine related byproducts may also be formed in the presence of organic amines during clo2 treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chlorine dioxide aliphatic amines free available chlorine membrane introduction mass spectrometry disinfection byproducts 1 introduction although chlorine is the most commonly used disinfectant in water treatment the formation of a large amount of disinfection byproducts dbps has caused wide concern because of their potential toxicity to human health du et al 2017 luo et al 2020 watson et al 2012 zhong et al 2019 more than 600 dbps have been discovered thus far luo et al 2020 stalter et al 2016 chlorine dioxide clo2 was used as an alternative disinfectant to chlorine since it produces much less regulated halogenated dbps shmeis et al 2009 li et al 1996 padhi et al 2019 vertova et al 2019 the primary dbps of clo2 are chlorite clo2 50 70 and chlorate clo3 0 30 and limited halogenated dbps yang et al 2021 it also has a high bactericidal effect over a wide ph range luo et al 2020 wen et al 2017 in addition clo2 can effectively control the taste and odor of source water by oxidizing iron and manganese into insoluble forms and removing them by filtration chen et al 2016 for these reasons clo2 has been widely used in public water systems as a pre oxidant or disinfectant wang et al 2012 ye et al 2019 although extensive research has been conducted to understand the reaction of clo2 in aqueous matrices only a few studies have focused on the formation of fac during this process it has been reported that hypochlorous acid hocl is formed during the clo2 disinfection process gan et al 2020 ravacha et al 1986 wajon et al 1982 phenols are one of the abundant moieties and react with clo2 to form hocl gan et al 2020 the mechanism involves one electron transfer followed by rapid decay of the phenoxyl oclo adduct as an intermediate rouge et al 2018 wajon et al 1982 in addition hocl can also be released when clo2 reacts with unsaturated olefins sulfur containing compounds aniline and some amino acids gan et al 2020 in general one electron is transferred from organic molecules to clo2 and the organic molecules are converted to free radicals then the free radicals will combine with oxygen atom of clo2 and release hocl gan et al 2020 wajon et al 1982 as a result chlorine related dbps may also be formed from the reaction of clo2 according to a previous study under drinking water treatment conditions clo2 degradation induces the in situ formation of free available chlorine fac including hocl ocl and cl2 resulting in the formation of substantial levels of halogenated dbps rouge et al 2018 studies have shown that a significant reduction in ndma formation was observed in the clo2 oxidation of amines gan et al 2015 lee et al 2007a uzun et al 2018 amines are considered the main precursors of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma during chlorination ndma has attracted much attention due to its high mutagenicity carcinogenicity and frequent detection andrzejewski and nawrocki 2009 uzun et al 2018 amines are widely present in the environment and have many natural and industrial sources methylamine ma dimethylamine dma ethylamine ea and diethylamine dea are the most commonly detected amines in surface water and the total concentration of them can even reach 139 μg l poste et al 2014 secondary amines including dma 0 79 0 88 μg l or 0 018 0 020 μm and dea 0 38 0 24 μg l or 0 0052 0 0033 μm were detected in groundwater and dma 1 78 1 51 μg l or 0 0396 0 0336 μm and dea 0 54 0 29 μg l or 0 0074 0 0040 μm were detected in river water in jialu river basin china ma et al 2012 the mechanism of aliphatic amines and clo2 reaction is shown as scheme s1 gan et al 2020 hull et al 1967 in the reaction tertiary amines were oxidized to secondary amines and clo2 was transformed to clo2 no hocl was detected rosenblatt et al 1967 however it has been reported that volatile organic chloramines including n chlorodimethylamine ch3 2ncl and dichloromethylamine ch3ncl2 were formed during the reaction of clo2 and some organic amine dye pollutants hu et al 2020 since ch3 2ncl and ch3ncl2 are the dominant volatile dbps during chlorination of these dye pollutants e et al 2019 guo et al 2021 fac resulting from the reaction of clo2 and organic amine dye pollutants may be the key to the formation of halogenated organic amines however due to the complex structure of organic amine dyes the mechanism of fac formation remains uncertain the preliminary results showed that ch3 2ncl was also formed during the reaction of clo2 and dimethylamine the results suggested that fac may be formed in the presence of clo2 and organic aliphatic amines the objective of the present study is to investigate the formation of fac resulting from the reaction of organic amines and clo2 to simplify the reaction six organic aliphatic amines with the simplest structure ma dma trimethylamine tma ea dea and triethylamine tea were selected as the model compounds fig s1 si 15nh4cl combined with membrane introduction mass spectrometry mims was employed to determine fac by analyzing the mass peak at m z 52 15nh2cl a possible reaction pathway of the release of fac in the reaction of clo2 with aliphatic amines was proposed additionally the influence of aliphatic amines on fac formation and related halo dbps in natural water were also examined 2 material and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals used in this study unless otherwise noted were purchased as reagent grade chemicals from j k scientific sodium hydrogen phosphate potassium dihydrogen phosphate sodium chlorite 80 and ma were purchased from alfa aesar dpd n n diethyl p phenylenediamine was purchased from acros organics dma 33 aqueous was purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd more detailed information about the main chemicals was showed in table s1 all solutions were used without further purification and prepared in distilled deionized water 2 2 experimental procedures clo2 stock solution was prepared by mixing 5 g sodium chlorite powder and 5 g sodium bisulfate monohydrate powder into 250 ml water sequentially in a 250 ml sealed glass bottle for two h hu et al 2020 ye et al 2013 the stock solution was kept in the dark at 4 c the concentration of clo2 stock solution was analysed by dpd fas titration it shows a signal as fac and 0 2 g glycine was added to 100 ml of sample to quench free chlorine before the titration apha 1998 all experiments in this study unless otherwise noted used 0 01 m phosphate buffer to achieve a ph of 7 0 solutions of aliphatic amine precursors were prepared at an initial concentration of 20 μm clo2 was added at clo2 precursor clo2 p molar ratios of 0 2 0 5 1 0 2 0 and 4 0 the experiment was carried out in an air tight 100 ml glass bottle unless otherwise noted the sampling reaction time was 8 h for tma and tea the sampling reaction time was 60 min the reaction solutions were protected from light at room temperature 10 ml sample was taken by a pipette into a 10 ml tube for detection and each experiment was sampled for 5 7 times in 8 h or monitored continuously for 60 min it has been verified that the increase of headspace during the reaction had little influence on the loss of clo2 the ph of the solution was adjusted by adding naoh or hcl 1 m rouge et al 2018 for fac quantification as previous studies reported nh4cl could be an appropriate fac quencher resulting in nh2cl as the product hu et al 2020 rouge et al 2018 mims is an optimized analytical method for measuring nh2cl li and blatchley 2009 however as shown in fig s2a and s2b the characteristic peaks of clo2 and nh2cl overlapped at m z 51 in the mass spectrum this would lead to a large error in the quantitative calculation therefore 15n labeled nh4cl was selected in this study to quench fac to 15nh2cl the mass spectrum of 15nh2cl was shown in fig s2c the characteristic peak at m z 52 was used for the quantitative calculation of 15nh2cl although nh4cl reacts significantly fast with fac k 2 7 104 m 1 s 1 rouge et al 2018 the formation of chloramines cannot be avoided because the reaction between fac and organic aliphatic amines such as dma is also fast k 8 9 103 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 0 deborde and von gunten 2008 excess 15nh4cl was used to ensure that fac was translated to 15nh2cl instead of organic chloramines approximately 200 μm 15n labeled nh4cl 10 times the concentration of precursors was added to the aqueous solution at the beginning of the reaction the content of organic chloramines was less than 5 when 15nh4cl was added to this system as a result the fac formed in this system was represented by the formation of 15nh2cl in the following descriptions unless otherwise noted fac in clo2 stock solution was transformed to 15nh2cl and measured by mims the result showed that there was approximate 0 28 μm free chlorine existed in 20 μm clo2 stock solution all the fac data have been modified by deducting the free chlorine in clo2 solution to investigate the formation of fac during the oxidation of aliphatic amines with clo2 in the actual water environment four natural water samples and tap water were collected in 600 ml bottles with screw caps from different locations in henan and beijing china the water samples were kept in frozen conditions and analyzed within 6 months experiments were conducted in the presence and absence of 20 μm dma which was selected as the model aliphatic amine precursor 15n labeled nh4cl was added to natural water samples to assess the formation potential of fac 2 3 analytical methods free chlorine stock solution was measured by uv absorbance at 292 nm εocl 350 m 1 cm 1 25 c and ph 9 5 lian et al 2014 mims combined with dpd fas titration was used to measure the concentrations of clo2 15nh2cl and other volatile dbps in this research guo et al 2021 lee et al 2007b li and blatchley 2007 the mims system used in this research was based on a modification of a shimadzu gc ms qp2010 mass spectrum scan mode 50 m z 200 and selected ion monitoring coupled with ei were used to identify and quantify possible dbps li and blatchley 2007 shang and blatchley 1999 other details of the configuration and setup for the mims system and operational conditions can be obtained from a previous study shang and blatchley 1999 the mass to charge ratios m z of the molecular ions at m z 52 61 67 and 78 were used to quantify 15nh2cl cyanogen chloride cncl clo2 and ch3 2ncl respectively it was verified that 15nh4cl does not react with clo2 fig s3 the limit of detection lod was listed in table s2 cl clo2 clo3 no3 and no2 were measured using a dionex ics 600 ion chromatographic ic system waltham usa with a 4 5 mm na2co3 0 8 mm nahco3 eluent at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 and a 50 μl sample injection loop the column was dionex ionpac as23 4 250 mm thermo scientific the samples were purged with nitrogen for 30 min to remove the residual clo2 thoroughly before ic analysis the lod of these anions was listed in table s3 all compound identifications by mims or ic were confirmed by analysis of standard solutions the molar yields of fac were calculated by dividing the concentration of fac by the amount of clo2 consumed following eq 1 1 fac yield fac formed μ m cl o 2 consumed μ m 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 formation of chloramines from reactions of clo2 and dma dbps and clo2 were monitored by mims during the reaction of clo2 and dma at a clo2 p molar ratio of 0 5 ch3 2ncl was identified as the major volatile dbp as shown in fig 1 the concentration of ch3 2ncl increased with the reaction time and reached 0 24 μm after 8 h as a previous study reported ch3 2ncl was produced during chlorination of dma guo et al 2021 however the tendency of ch3 2ncl formation in this study is different from that of dma chlorination during chlorination ch3 2ncl was formed immediately when chlorine was added and then decayed slightly at a low cl p ratio 1 0 and a small amount of ch3ncl2 was also formed at the same time guo et al 2021 in contrast during the reaction between clo2 and dma the concentration of ch3 2ncl increased with increasing reaction time and there was no tendency to decrease in 8 h overall the reaction between clo2 and dma follows pseudo second order reaction kinetics fig s4 no detectable ch3ncl2 was found to be formed in the reaction these results indicated that fac may form in situ during the reaction between dma and clo2 due to the low concentration of fac only ch3 2ncl generated in the system and ch3ncl2 cannot be formed 3 2 quantification of fac from reactions of clo2 with aliphatic amines to further prove that fac was formed from the reactions of clo2 with aliphatic amines 15n labeled nh4cl was employed to quench the in situ formed fac fig 2 shows the formation of fac and the consumption of clo2 as a function of time for the reaction between clo2 and model methyl amines at clo2 p ratio of 1 0 the rate constant of fac formation from ma and dma was 1 7 103 m 1 s 1 and 4 3 103 m 1 s 1 respectively then fac formation increased relatively slow after 3 h the results of the reaction of ethyl amines and clo2 were shown in fig s5 the data showed similar results with methyl amines the tendency of fac formation was similar to the reaction of clo2 with phenol or natural organic matter rouge et al 2018 however for tertiary amines tma and tea the concentration of fac decreased significantly after 30 min that may be due to the consumption of the fac indicator 15nh2cl reacting with other compounds in the reaction system the fac formation rate constant from tma was 4 4 103 m 1 s 1 dma showed the highest fac concentration of 1 3 μm approximately 17 based on consumed clo2 after 3 h while tma and tea showed the highest fac concentration of 0 4 μm at reaction time of 30 min the trend of clo2 consumption was tertiary amines secondary amines primary amines which is consistent with the literatures rosenblatt et al 1967 terhalle et al 2018 for secondary and primary amines although the formation of fac stabilized after one hour clo2 continued to be consumed it indicated that the formation of fac was only part of the reaction between amines and clo2 other reactions occurred in the reaction system at the same time and resulting in the consumption of clo2 it has been reported that the second order rate constant of clo2 and triethylamine is approximately 102 times faster than that of diethylamine rosenblatt et al 1963 for tertiary amines the consumption rate of clo2 was much faster than other amines and clo2 almost exhausted in 60 min in this system however the yield of fac was relatively low and decreased significantly after 30 min the results indicated that fac formation resulting from tertiary amines was different from primary and secondary amines in the reaction with clo2 before fac formed tertiary amines need to be converted to secondary amines and aldehyde by clo2 oxidation and the reaction rate is fast k 2 1 105 m 1 s 1 scheme s1 in addition clo2 was quickly consumed in the process due to the high reactivity of nh2cl with aldehyde k 2 8 0 1 104 m 1 s 1 nh2cl was likely to be consumed by the reaction with aldehyde resulting from tertiary amines and clo2 pedersen et al 1999 in addition nh2cl can also react with residual amines such as with dma to form ndma choi and valentine 2002 this is also a way to consume nh2cl as a result fac signals decreased in 30 min overall the formation of fac was observed in all the six aliphatic amine precursor cases it was confirmed that aliphatic amines have the potential to form fac during the clo2 oxidation in addition in situ formed fac may have the potential to generate halogenated dbps the conclusion can also explain the results of previous study on the formation of ch3 2ncl in the reaction between clo2 and organic dyes with dimethylamine functional group hu et al 2020 3 3 effect of clo2 doses on fac formation to assess the influence of different clo2 doses on the formation of fac six aliphatic amines were treated with clo2 at clo2 p ratio ranging from 0 2 to 4 0 fac was monitored by adding 15nh4cl to the reaction solution before adding clo2 the formation of fac in 8 h tma and tea in 30 min and maximum yields were shown in fig s6 and fig 3 respectively as shown in fig s6 the concentrations of fac produced in 8 h by clo2 and six aliphatic amines ranged from 0 2 μm to 2 3 μm and generally increased with the increasing of clo2 dose however when the dosage of clo2 was excessive the precursors might be more easily oxidized by other pathways and resulted in the decrease of fac for example the maximum fac concentration resulting from ea was 1 0 μm at clo2 p ratio 2 0 and decreased to less than 0 2 μm at clo2 p ratio 4 0 compared with other amines tertiary amines were shown to be less active to produce fac at different clo2 p ratio which is consistent with the results above the yields of fac were calculated based on the maximum concentrations of fac and consumed clo2 as shown in fig 3 the highest yields of fac were found at clo2 p ratio 0 5 in most of cases the reactivity of amines with clo2 to result fac follows the sequence tertiary amines secondary amines primary amines for methyl amines fig 3a ma showed the highest fac yield of 45 and then decreased to 5 as clo2 p ratio increased from 0 5 to 4 0 the results indicated that the pathway to produce fac was not dominated at high dose of clo2 p ratio in addition excess clo2 was likely to lead to other oxidation reactions in the system previous study has confirmed that although amine reaction has been completed clo2 continues to be consumed rosenblatt et al 1963 indicating that there are other reactions occurred in the system at the same time ethyl amines had the similar results to methyl amines fig 3b the highest fac yields were observed during the reaction of ea and clo2 at clo2 p ratio 0 5 these results suggested that ma or ea have similar reactivity with phenol when reacting with clo2 to form fac according to the literatures approximately 40 50 of fac was formed per mole of chlorine dioxide during the reaction between phenol and chlorine dioxide rouge et al 2018 terhalle et al 2018 3 4 formation of inorganic products the concentrations of clo2 clo3 and cl in 10 μm clo2 stock solution were measured by ic to be 0 31 μm 7 32 μm and 8 59 μm respectively they was relatively stable in 24 h given the high background of clo3 and cl in the system it is hard to distinguish them from clo2 and amine products on the other hand clo2 can be quantified because of its low background and high yield in the system the inorganic products clo2 and clo3 were measured in the reaction of dma and clo2 the results showed that there was no observable clo3 formed during this process as shown in fig s7a and s7b the rapid formation of clo2 and fac was observed at the beginning of the reaction to 1 h and then increased relatively slowly this trend was consistent with the consumption of clo2 fig s7c the concentrations of clo2 and fac were approximately 1 4 μm to 7 1 μm and 1 4 μm to 2 3 μm at the clo2 p ratio 0 5 to 2 0 respectively at clo2 p ratio 0 5 the concentration of fac was close to clo2 and the yield of fac based on consumed clo2 was approximately 45 as the dosages of clo2 increased the proportion of clo2 formation was increased compared with fac after 1 h the concentration of fac was reached an apparent plateau and tended to be stable however clo2 was still consumed with a relatively slow increase in the formation of clo2 these results indicate that the one electron transfer between the aliphatic amines and clo2 is a critical step in fac formation and the generated amine radicals combine with chlorine dioxide for further decomposition to generate fac the total concentration of clo2 and fac was calculated at 1 h as shown in fig s8 approximately 28 62 clo2 was formed within 1 h at clo2 p ratio 0 5 to 2 0 the yields of fac ranged from 15 to 30 the result was consistent with previous study that amines exhibited clo2 yields 50 at high clo2 p ratio the total concentration of clo2 and fac was accounting for 58 84 of the consumed clo2 the missing parts may be cl and clo3 it was reported that the yields of clo3 from clo2 oxidation of amines were below 10 and amines have the potential to further reduce clo2 to cl just like sulfur containing compounds gan et al 2019 it is likely cl and clo3 account for missing atomic chlorine recovery however high background in clo2 stock solution makes it difficult to quantify in addition considering the complexity of amines oxidation some chlorinated products may be produced in the reaction system no2 and no3 were also monitored at the same time however the results showed that neither no2 nor no3 was formed during this process it indicated that the nitrogen of aliphatic amine may stay in organic n 3 5 effect of ph on fac formation previous study has shown that the reaction rate of amines and clo2 increased with ph increasing from 4 70 to 7 11 rosenblatt et al 1963 to assess the influence of ph on the formation of fac during the reaction of amines and clo2 experiments were carried out at ph from 5 0 to 11 0 dma pka 10 73 0 10 was selected as model precursor to react with clo2 however the stability of nh2cl is highly correlated with ph and is easy to form and stabilize at alkaline condition soulard et al 1981 it is not appropriate to use it to study the ph effect of fac formation to avoid the problem ch3 2ncl was monitored as the unique volatile dbp in the absence of 15nh4cl as discussed above due to the complex clo2 oxidation reaction system a part of fac formed by dma and clo2 was likely to be lost and could not produce ch3 2ncl as a result the concentration of ch3 2ncl only represent part of fac formed in the system since different ph has little effect on ch3 2ncl formation in chlorination over a wide ph range 5 0 to 11 0 guo et al 2021 fig s9 ch3 2ncl is more suitable for evaluating the effect of ph on the formation of fac during the reaction of between dma and clo2 the effect of ph on the ch3 2ncl formation by the reaction of dma and clo2 was shown in fig 4 from ph 5 0 to 11 0 the maximum concentration of ch3 2ncl approximately 0 11 μm appeared at ph 6 0 and 11 0 respectively however the clo2 consumption was increased with the increasing of ph fig s10 these results confirmed that there were various reaction pathways in the reaction between dma and clo2 and the formation of fac was only one of them in addition the rate limiting step of the formation of fac from the reaction between dma and clo2 was ph related the reaction of clo2 and amines was accelerated under alkaline conditions and the formation of fac was also favorable at ph 6 0 these results suggest that the reaction of clo2 and amine and the release of fac may be two independent rate limiting steps in fac formation 3 6 fac formation pathways during oxidation of aliphatic amine with clo2 as described above clo2 was the dominant product of clo2 in the system indicating that one electron transfer pathway was the main reaction mechanism base on the results above a possible fac formation pathway was proposed in scheme 1 the primary step of this oxidation process involves one electron transfer between the aliphatic amines and clo2 to produce amine radical and clo2 then aliphatic amine oclo adduct is formed and decays rapidly in addition hocl release at the same time for primary aliphatic amines nitroso alkane was the additional product when r was a methyl group the product was to be nitrosomethane it would like to tautomerize to a more stable formaldehyde oxime long et al 2001 for secondary amines an intermediate oxoammonium salt was formed and it is a chemically active oxidant and even reacts with precursors and form dimethylhydroxylamine the process would lead to more consumption of the precursors this hypothesis was consistent with the results for the highest fac yields at clo2 p ratios of 0 5 or 0 2 fig 3 however due to the low concentration of dimethylhydroxylamine it was hardly detected it indicated that the oxidation of amines was miscellaneous and resulting in a very complex reaction system the hypothesis of fac formation mechanism is consistent with the result of ph as shown in fig 4 there are two favorable ph conditions for the formation of fac as described in scheme 1 under acidic conditions the release of hocl was accelerated considering the relatively favorable condition for ch3 2ncl formation was ph 7 0 it was reasonable that the maximum concentration of fac was found at ph 6 0 in addition it was reported that the apparent rate constants for clo2 oxidation of amine compounds generally increase with increasing ph because the deprotonated species are stronger electron donors lee et al 2007a as a result although the first step was not conductive to form hocl the electron transfer between the aliphatic amines and clo2 was enhanced at higher ph which may promote the release of hocl as a result higher concentration of ch3 2ncl was found to be formed at ph 11 0 these results indicated that removal of an electron from aliphatic amine by clo2 to form an amine radical and clo2 may be the rate limiting step for the formation of hocl which has been proved in the reaction of clo2 and phenol wajon et al 1982 3 7 formation of fac in natural water treatment by clo2 there is a wide range of amines compounds and many have been detected in the environment and are recognized as toxic organic pollutants forgacs et al 2004 guo et al 2021 wang et al 2011 to assess the influence of aliphatic amines on fac formation in environmental water four natural water samples and tap water collected were treated with 5 mg l clo2 the parameters of these water samples are listed in detail in table s4 however there are many impurities in all natural water systems and some of them could also react with clo2 and form hocl at the same time the function of aliphatic amines that may exist in natural waters is difficult to be identified dma is an important pollutant in wastewater that exists in primary effluent and typically ranges from 30 to 80 μg l mitch and sedlak 2004 therefore additional dma was added as model compound to the water samples since fac precursors may be present in high concentrations in real water samples 20 μm dma was chosen to spike in water samples to make the difference more pronounced fac was monitored by adding 15nh4cl the result was shown in fig 5 approximately 0 5 6 0 μm fac was formed in original water samples after oxidation by clo2 for 2 h while 1 0 6 1 μm fac was measured after 20 μm dma added it was obviously that the addition of dma increased the concentration of fac the concentration of fac in the oxidation process of tap water was even increased by 116 after 20 μm dma added this result verified that aliphatic amines have positive effect on fac formation in clo2 disinfection of natural water the volatile dbps were also measured by mims including trichloramine chloroform chcl3 dichloroacetonitrile dichloromethlyamine cncl and ch3 2ncl only cncl and ch3 2ncl were detected and the other products were all lower than lod it was because although a large amount of excess 15nh4cl was added to quench in situ formed fac there were still other chlorinated dbps generated due to the fast formation rate such as ch3 2ncl k 8 9 103 m 1 s 1 deborde and von gunten 2008 and cncl k 1 22 109 m 1 s 1 gerritsen and margerum 1990 the time course concentrations of fac cncl and ch3 2ncl resulting from tap water and water sample 3 were shown in fig s11 and s12 respectively the results showed that the addition of dma has a certain impact and increased the concentration and formation rate of fac in addition the consumption of clo2 was increased at the same time a large amount of ch3 2ncl were generated in addition to ch3 2ncl a small amount of cncl was also formed in the system as shown in fig s11 0 01 μm cncl was generated in first 4 h and then decreased below the detection limit at 8 h in tap water after dma was spiked in the water sample the formation of cncl was promoted slightly to 0 02 μm with no decreasing trend in 8 h in addition cncl formation was slightly decreased in the spiked water samples when the concentrations of dbps were high fig s12 it is because the precursors of cncl in the water sample need to compete with the relatively high concentration of dma for inadequate fac overall the addition of amines could increase the formation of fac and then increase the concentration of chlorinated dbps the formation of ch3 2ncl and cncl indicated that fac in situ formed in natural water samples was partially consumed it means that the fac concentration calculated was underestimated in addition studies have shown organic chloramines have high potential adverse effects on human health bull et al 2011 how et al 2017 jiang et al 2019 it is reported that ch3ncl2 has approximately three orders of magnitude more toxic than chcl3 e et al 2019 ch3 2ncl may also have high risk to human health cncl is a volatile and toxic asphyxiant that can affect multiple organs such as the central nervous cardiovascular and pulmonary systems abu soud et al 2012 the formation of these chlorinated dbps should be concerning during clo2 disinfection in the presence of amine precursors 4 conclusions this study demonstrates that aliphatic amines could form fac when react with clo2 it is a new type of precursors with potential to form fac in clo2 oxidation aliphatic amines similar as phenol can quickly react with clo2 to form fac and up to 45 of clo2 can be converted to fac at low clo2 p ratios in addition organic chloramines and other dbps can also be formed during this process experiments in real waters showed that the presence of aliphatic amines can promote the formation of fac in real water matrices because amines are ubiquitous in surface water they may make a contribution to the formation of fac when clo2 is used as a pre oxidant or disinfectant in water treatment plant the concentration of fac can be increased by 2 5 116 when 20 μm dma is present in natural water it will make the clo2 disinfection system more complicated although the yields of fac generated are relatively low during real water treatment large amounts of halogenated dbps such as cncl and ch3 2ncl may be formed during the clo2 treatment of certain amine containing wastewater as a result the fac formation potential of aliphatic amines should be of concern and need further study the results confirmed that in addition to amines with specific structures or functional groups there are some compounds that may react with clo2 to form fac the in situ formation of fac may be more than what we estimated in the clo2 oxidation systems

importantly explore the tolerance of pn a to atmac c16 and the key resistant strain nitrogen removal efficiency was influenced by environmental and extreme levels of atmac c16 through mainly affecting the anammox hzsb gene two types of anammox candidatus jettenia and candidatus kuenenia were enriched under the pressure of atmac c16 which allowed pn a system to maintain good nitrogen removal performance atmac c16 might cause the hormesis of entire microbial population in pn a system leading to the enhancement of cell viability atmac c16 decreased the relative abundances of most antibiotics resistance genes args but significantly enriched qacs resistance genes qrgs the tolerance of pn a system to atmac c16 might be strengthened by inducing the efflux pumps encoding genes qach 01 02 microbial hosts dynamic and co selection mechanism among args and qrgs resulted in the opposite trends of qacedeltal 01 02 and qach 01 02 pseudoxanthomonas mexicana was identified as the atmac c16 resistant strain and its resistance to 10 mg l atmac c16 might not only obtain by capturing the qach gene but also benefit from its own efflux pump system therefore from the perspective of the transmission of resistance genes especially for qrgs the spread risk of qrgs and atmac c16 resistant strain in pn a technique should be taken seriously graphical abstract image graphical abstract

quaternary ammonium compounds qacs have been widely consumed as disinfectants and surfactants worldwide levy and marshall 2004 which are active ingredients in hospital personal care products and household cleaners recent years due to the pandemic of covid 19 the usage of qacs is increased significantly to limit the transmission of disease dewey et al 2021 however in addition to being effective component in alleviating the burden of disease or virus qacs seem to result in negative impacts on human health and the environment hora et al 2020 for instance the increased consumption of qacs can increase the loads to wastewater treatment plants and further raise the opportunity of qacs being discharged into the external environment agathokleous et al 2022 although a considerable amount of qacs can be removed in wastewater treatment plants residual qacs of 20 300 μg l in effluent have been detected hora and arnold 2020 especially qacs are detected at level up to mg l in effluent of hospital di nica et al 2017 hora et al 2020 and more seriously qacs are found to be up to 10 times effluent level in influent wastewater and adsorbed to activated sludge hora et al 2020 therefore monitoring of exposure of biological treatment processes in wastewater treatment plants to qacs is helpful to comprehend their biological toxicity to microorganisms and risk assessment of bio accumulation potential hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride atmac c16 is a major type of qacs and found to be contained in cosmetics and hair conditioners zheng et al 2021 which is also frequently detected in the environment and exhibits considerable antimicrobial activities zheng et al 2021 up to now most studies focused on the interaction between benzylalkyldimethylammonium compounds bacs and biological treatment processes in wastewater treatment plants for example previous study found that bacs can be transformed during process of denitrification and nitrate can still be reduced to n2 under pressure of 25 mg l bac tezel and pavlostathis 2009 chen et al found that 5 0 mg l of bac decreases ammonium removal efficiency and causes membrane fouling in membrane bioreactors chen et al 2018 however little is known about the potential impacts of atmac c16 on activated sludge and performance of biological wastewater treatment processes especially on partial nitrification anammox pn a system pn a technique as one of the most innovative wastewater biological treatment process lackner et al 2014 has already been recognized as a sustainable biological process for nitrogen removal li et al 2020d pn a system has a micro aerobic environment and provides ideal environment for the survival of anammox and other functional bacteria which might cause the emergence of many complicated and unneglected variations in the presence of atmac c16 it is still unknown that how atmac c16 with different levels affect the system performance by affecting the functional microorganisms and overall microbial activity previous study proposed that too high level of qacs can inhibit the microbial activity tandukar et al 2013 while too low level of qacs may not be used as carbon source by microorganisms hora et al 2020 therefore exploring the multi directional impacts of atmac c16 on nitrogen removal functional microbes and genes of pn a system at microbiological level is of great meaningful to fill the gap in the insights of interaction mechanism between atmac c16 and pn a system furthermore in subsequent practical applications when pn a system encounters water quality fluctuations caused by different concentrations of atmac c16 the fundamental causes of n removal performance and microbial activity responses can be quickly identified and effectively dealt with the excessive consumption of qacs may not only cause the proliferation of qacs resistant bacteria but also develop antibiotic resistance bacteria agathokleous et al 2022 most studies on qacs resistance and cross resistance focused on bacs previous study found that the resistance of an aerobic sediment microbial system to bacs and several antibiotics tetracycline and ciprofloxacin is simultaneously enhanced after exposing to sub inhibitory levels of bacs tandukar et al 2013 another research was that co resistance is responsible for the emergence of antibiotic resistance namely bacs resistance genes and antibiotic resistance genes args are co located in a same host sequence hora et al 2020 studies found that bacs can decrease the susceptibility of some species to several antibiotics but several studies loughlin et al 2002 merchel and tagkopoulos 2019 also reached the opposite conclusion i e the susceptibility of microbes to antibiotics is increased however the research on the resistance of atmac c16 to microorganism in activated sludge and the corresponding resistant strain was still in deficiency especially for pn a system based on biofilm in this study it had high density of biomass complex microorganisms and a changeable microbial environment atmac c16 related resistance genes such as qac genes might be induced by atmac c16 and spread through horizontal gene transfer hgt depending on cell to cell contact of such dense microbial population which need to be explored and clarified importantly whether the qac genes are harbored in atmac c16 resistant strains and by what mode of transmission hgt or co selection in the pn a system has not been reported in previous studies previous study also proposed that integrons inti1 harbor qac genes encoding efflux pump amos et al 2018 which grant the microbes to capture other args through hgt in addition to integrons other mobile genetic elements mges such as transposases are also reported to be associated with qac genes merchel and tagkopoulos 2019 therefore the long term impacts of atmac c16 on the fates of args qacs related resistance genes qrgs mges and the corresponding resistant microbes in pn a system need to be deeply explored in this study pn a system was successively applied with atmac c16 to explore the responses of system performances and the ability of tolerance to different concentrations of atmac c16 in addition to the nitrogen removal performance and the corresponding functional genes the reactive oxygen species ros cell viability and lactate dehydrogenase ldh were also determined throughout the operational process to assess the microbial activity in the presence of atmac c16 importantly the qrgs and the resistance mechanisms were revealed to evaluate the emergence risk of qrgs furthermore the enriched bacteria under 10 mg l atmac c16 were isolated and identified by method of pure culture to decipher the specific atmac c16 resistant strain which might be the hosts harboring qac this study might provide comprehensive insights on the interactions between various levels of atmac c16 and pn a system especially on the propagation of qrgs and atmac c16 resistant strain in pn a technique in the practical application of pn a it might make it possible to identify the propagation pattern of qrgs and args and then carry out the corresponding risk management 2 materials and methods 2 1 operation of pn a system in present study pn a system has been successfully started up and already running for a period in a cylindrical lab sequencing batch reactor with the total effective volume of 8 l initially aerobic granular sludge from a pilot scale sequencing batch reactor li et al 2020b was selected as the inoculated sludge due to its excellent solid liquid separation performance and long sludge retention time it was used for the initial biofilm formation and start up of pn a system the biofilm carriers were biowater technology bwtx which were strung together by strings and fixed on a stainless steel frame with the filling ratio of 70 during the stable operation of the pn a system the dissolved oxygen level and temperature was maintained at 1 5 mg l and 30 2 c respectively based on the stable pn a system atmac c16 was applied to this pn a system with the increasing level from 0 5 to 10 mg l the atmac c16 was divided into four grades low concentration i e environmental concentration 0 5 mg l moderate concentration 1 0 and 2 0 mg l high concentration 5 0 mg l and extreme concentration 10 mg l the pn a system was operated to treat the synthetic wastewater which consisted of 70 mg l ammonium nitrogen nh4 n 15 mg l orthophosphate po4 3 p and 1 25 g l nahco3 2 2 sample collection and microbiological analysis seven sludge samples named as seed pn1 pn2 pn3 pn4 pn5 and pn6 were collected during the whole pn a operational process which was divided into six stages in detail pn a system was in a steady nitrogen removal state before the addition of atmac c16 which was defined as stage 1 the process of adding 0 5 1 0 2 0 5 0 and 10 mg l atmac c16 was considered as stage 2 3 4 5 and 6 respectively the initial seed sludge sample was named as seed not the original aerobic granular sludge sample but the sludge sample corresponding to the first successful start up of the pn a system sample pn1 6 was collected at the end of stage 1 6 respectively in addition water samples were collected for the measure of nh4 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n and nitrate nitrogen no3 n every 3 4 days according to the standard methods apha 2005 a part of sludge sample was collected to execute the biochemical analysis such as ros cell viability and ldh within 2 h another part of sludge was used to extract dna to determine the key functional genes involved in pn a system including ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob amoa gene denitrifying bacteria dnb genes nirg nirs and nosz and anammox hzsb genes all the primers of functional genes were given table s1 for further microbial genome level analysis illumina novaseq pe250 platform was used for the high throughput sequencing normalization reads of 77 170 sequences based on the 16s rrna gene v3 v4 region and the data was uploaded to sequence read archive with the accession number of prjna781670 2 3 determination of cellular enzyme activity of pn a system to clarify the damage of atmac c16 to microorganisms in pn a system the cellular enzyme activity including ros cell viability and ldh were detected under atmac c16 load with continuous gradient increase for the ros level it was measured by a ros assay kit beyotime china which selected 2 7 dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate as a fluorescent probe moreover the cell viability was determined by cell counting kit 8 cck 8 kit beyotime china according to the kit instructions ldh was determined by ldh cytotoxicity assay kit beyotime china a microplate detector pt 3502b china with 96 well plates was applied to detect the ros excitation wavelength 488 nm emission wavelength 525 nm cell viability wavelength of 450 nm and ldh wavelength of 490 nm 2 4 atmac c16 resistance assessment to estimate the tolerance of pn a system to atmac c16 five qrgs including qace qacedelta1 01 02 and qach 01 02 were investigated for args the target args selected in this study covered the resistance genes corresponding to many common antibiotics including four aminoglycoside resistance genes aac 6 ib aada strb and apha two macrolide resistance genes erea and ermf three sulfonamide resistance genes sul1 sul2 and sul3 and three tetracycline resistance genes teta tetg and tetq these args were also used to explore the co selection relationships with qrgs meanwhile three types of mges including a transposase tp614 two integrons inti1 and inti3 and an insertion is613 which included some important types of mges were investigated to assess the risk of propagating of qrgs through the way of hgt the detail primers of all the args qrgs and mges were listed table s1 all the real time qpcr of resistance genes were conducted on wafergen smartchip real time pcr system in technical triplicates the detailed amplification procedure and the calculation of the relative abundance of resistance genes were according to previous studies zhu et al 2013a zhu et al 2017 2 5 identification and isolation of atmac c16 resistance bacteria to further identify the microorganisms resistant to atmac c16 a micro cosmic experiment was designed and implemented firstly minimal salt medium was prepared by dissolving a group of nutrients including nh4 2so4 2 0 g mgso4 7h2o 0 2 g cacl2 2h2o 0 01 g feso4 7h2o 0 001 g na2hpo4 12h2o 1 5 g kh2po4 1 5 g and agar 18 g in 1 l distilled water after that minimal salt medium was sterilized and added with atmac c16 10 mg l and then it was poured into several sterile petri dishes for standby secondly appropriate amount of sludge was collected and settled naturally for 30 min hence 1 0 ml supernatant was diluted 10 100 and 1000 times then they were applied on petri dishes thirdly different morphologies of colonies growing in the petri dishes were selected for further purification and the purified products were sequenced and finally compared in the national center for biotechnology information ncbi database to obtain the information of target strains these isolated strains would be considered as atmac c16 resistant strains which might be helpful to the risk assessment of drug resistance in pn a system 2 6 oligotypes identification for the resistant taxa the oligotypes of target resistant taxa obtained from results of high throughput sequencing were analyzed to further identify the base sequences which were possibly involved in qacs resistance mechanism the analysis procedure of oligotypes performed on quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime was based on 98 of operational taxonomic unit otu division level shannon entropy was calculated through analyze entropy script in the oligotyping pipeline based on the sequencing results of qacs resistant bacteria the calculation procedure of oligotyping for qacs resistance taxon was kept operating until the oligotypes purity score 100 reads was 0 90 and more specific information of analysis procedures for oligotypes were presented in previous research eren et al 2014 2 7 bioinformatics analysis mantel test was implemented in pcord 5 to clarify the correlations between resistance genes profile and bacterial population paleontological statistics past was adopted to generate principal coordinate analysis pcoa similarity percentage simper analysis one way anova and redundancy analysis rda tbtools chen et al 2020 was applied to create heat map the correlations between bacterial taxa and resistance genes were revealed by spearman s rank correlation coefficients srccs afterwards cytoscape 3 3 0 was applied to create the network visualization among args qrgs and mges at the same time the co occurrence pattern between potential degrading bacteria and qrgs was established 3 results and discussion 3 1 performances variation of pn a and the fates of n related functional genes the environmental atmac c16 0 5 mg l significantly p 0 05 affected the nh4 n and tin removal efficiencies fig 1 a b the potential reason might be that pn a system had never been exposed to atmac c16 before when the system suddenly suffered from the atmac c16 for the first time the nitrogen removal efficiency could be significantly impacted even the concentration of atmac c16 was low however they gradually recovered not only that the average nitrogen removal caused by anammox decreased from 74 9 stage 1 to 61 5 stage 2 but recovered to 67 3 and 72 2 in stage 3 and 4 respectively pn a system seemed to be resistant to moderate 1 0 and 2 0 mg l atmac c16 after adapting to 0 5 mg l atmac c16 for a period of time therefore the background concentration of atmac c16 presented in wastewater might not be undesirable to some extent because at least it might grant the pn a system the stronger ability to resist up to 2 0 mg l atmac c16 even under the high level of atmac c16 5 0 mg l stage 5 the average tin loss caused by anammox just only decreased slightly to 64 8 higher than stage 2 indicating that pn a system showed strong adaptability and tolerance to atmac c16 however extreme level 10 mg l of atmac c16 significantly inhibited the nh4 n and tin removal efficiencies in the initial stage 6 the average n loss caused by anammox sharply decreased to 57 2 fig 1 b but eventually recovered to 71 8 although the system had been acclimated by low and medium concentration atmac c16 before the toxic effect of extreme concentration of atmac c16 on pn a system might be significantly improved which might temporarily inhibit the activity of multiple functional microorganisms so as to inhibit the nitrogen removal efficiency in stage 1 5 the proportion of n loss caused by anammox and other pathways such as denitrification accounted for 97 4 and 1 8 of the loss of tin respectively however these two percentages decreased to 88 7 and increased to 7 3 respectively in stage 6 in stage 6 the tin removal of pn a system benefited from the joint effect of anammox process and other pathways all these changes might be related to the variations of a series of functional genes involved in the nitrogen removal in pn a system in present pn a the variation of tin loss had significant positive correlation with n loss caused by anammox r2 0 8414 p 0 01 fig 1 c implying that most n was removed by anammox even under extreme level of atmac c16 meanwhile since there was no carbon source in the pn a system the proportion of n loss caused by other way such as denitrification was very small however extreme level of atmac c16 10 mg l might be considered as a type of carbon source which could be utilized by microorganism which made other nitrogen removal process such as denitrification reinvigorate fig 1 d presented the variations of relative abundances normalized to 16s rrna genes of aob amoa narg nosz nars and hzsb genes the aob amoa gene seemed to be more vulnerable to atmac c16 than other n related genes especially in stage 6 the relative abundances of aob amoa and hzsb genes significantly decreased which might destroy the proportional balance between nh4 n and no2 n and weaken the anammox process fig 1 e showed a schematic diagram of pn a including functional genes and clarified the n removal pathway n removal by anammox or other ways kartal et al 2010 li et al 2019 previous study proposed that the coexistence of aob and anammox bacteria in pn a system is favorable for nitrogen removal chen et al 2019 hzsb was the dominant functional gene accounted for 87 5 91 8 and this pn a had almost no carbon source therefore the impacts of atmac c16 on pn a were mainly achieved by breaking the nitrogen balance and inhibiting anammox bacteria from the perspective of the recovery performance of pn a several atmac c16 resistant bacteria might play a key role in preventing system collapse eventually anammox bacteria could execute the removal of n while resisting atmac c16 however the emergence and disseminate of multi drug resistant genes might also be caused by co selection mechanism among genes li et al 2015 3 2 microbial community response and the corresponding biological activity microbial community as the crucial participants in pn a system would be more or less affected by atmac c16 one of the direct results was the fluctuation of functional genes mentioned above which further affected the performances of the system such as nh4 n or tin and the corresponding removal efficiencies as shown in fig 2 a three types of anammox bacteria candidatus jettenia candidatus kuenenia and candidatus brocadia presented different variational trends in detail candidatus jettenia gradually increased from 0 02 in seed to 2 62 in pn6 along with the addition of atmac c16 with an increase multiple of 130 it could be seen that the relative abundance of candidatus brocadia was surprisingly high in seed 5 32 which might be the key reason why the pn a system could maintain good tin removal performance the proliferation of anammox bacteria were inhibited when pn a system encountered atmac c16 for the first time 0 5 mg l which was consistent with the results of nitrogen removal in fig 1 subsequently due to the strong adaptability of candidatus kuenenia and candidatus brocadia they were significantly enriched in stage of moderate level 1 0 and 2 0 mg l however high 5 0 mg l and extreme levels 10 mg l of atmac c16 sharply inhibited the proliferation of candidatus brocadia and had slight effect on candidatus kuenenia it could be concluded that different concentrations of atmac c16 might lead to differentiation of different types of anammox bacteria candidatus brocadia presented significant difference from candidatus jettenia and candidatus kuenenia fig s1 atmac c16 seemed unable to poison all types of anammox bacteria which made a considerable part of anammox bacteria such as candidatus jettenia candidatus kuenenia survive in pn a system to maintain good nitrogen removal performance although the relative abundance of anammox bacteria was not high on the whole 0 13 2 62 it seemed that this might not affect the nitrogen removal which meant that these finally survived anammox bacteria in pn a system after the addition of atmac c16 were sufficient to undertake nitrogen removal previous study also reported that anammox bacteria with the relative abundance of 0 11 can be responsible for the n loss and improve the nitrogen removal in a full scale municipal wastewater treatment plant li et al 2019 it was worth noting that several bacteria such as arenimonas hyphomicrobium and pseudofulvimonas were enriched eventually in pn6 fig 2 a and they have functions of denitrification wang et al 2021 even though denitratisoma a denitrifiers zhang et al 2019 showed decreasing tendency along with the increase level of atmac c16 the relative abundance of it in pn6 was also comparable to arenimonas hyphomicrobium and pseudofulvimonas hyphomicrobium was reported to have the capability of transforming nitrate to nitrite langone et al 2014 in addition denitrifiers arenimonas has capability of autotrophic metabolisms which can survive in environment with limited carbon source wang et al 2020 the enrichments of these denitrifiers might be one of the reasons of that the nitrogen removal performance of pn a system could be maintained even the anammox bacteria were inhibited as shown in fig 2 b the cell viability of all samples collected at the end of each stage showed increasing trend indicating that the cell viability of the entire microbial community was enhanced after pn a system adapted to each level of atmac c16 the potential reason might be due to the hormesis caused by atmac c16 disinfectant such as qacs hrubec et al 2021 can induce hormesis in microorganisms and furthermore the effect of hormesis may facilitate the development and spread of drug resistance agathokleous et al 2022 cell viability values were measured at the end of each stage which could reflect that pn a system had good adaptability and recovery ability to each atmac c16 concentration even though nh4 n and tin removal efficiencies were significantly inhibited at the beginning of stage 6 extreme level they were restored in the middle and late phases of stage 6 therefore the inhibitions of nh4 n and tin removal efficiencies and the enhanced cell viability of the entire microbial community at extreme level were not contradictory the ros level was enhanced when the pn a system was stimulated by 0 5 2 0 mg l atmac c16 while it decreased gradually under high 5 0 mg l and extreme level 10 mg l of atmac c16 previous study reported that the external toxic substances such as triclosan can stimulate microbial cells to generate oxidative stress response thereby increasing the production of ros lu et al 2018 it could not be neglected that the ros accumulation is responsible for the sharing mechanism of antibacterial drugs which can cause dna damage dharmaraja 2017 li et al 2021b in addition the level of ldh can positively reflect the degree of cell damage or lysis which might cause the release dong et al 2019 and spread of intracellular resistance genes li et al 2021a the variational trend of ldh level in pn a system was similar to that of ros fig 2 b but it did not seem to significantly affect the microbial activity the decreasing microbial diversity observed species might be one of the reasons to that previous study also found similar decreasing trend of microbial community diversity after long term exposure of aerobic microbial system to bacs tandukar et al 2013 several bacteria such as denitrifiers denitratisoma and nitrosomonas aob could not survive and be washed out finally under the pressure of atmac c16 which allowed the remaining bacteria such as drug resistant bacteria to obtain ample living space then it was reasonable to speculate that atmac c16 might change the distribution of qrgs and other types of resistance genes through affecting the microbial population and levels of cell viability ros and ldh 3 3 emergence of resistance genes and the corresponding resistance mechanisms as shown in fig 3 a 76 resistance gene detected in present study decreased eventually only qace qacedeltal 01 02 and is613 were enriched in pn6 in each sample qrgs were the most dominant resistance genes followed by sulfonamides related resistance gene and mges fig 3 b the total relative abundance of resistance genes was on the rise in general which was determined by qrgs occupying an absolute dominant abundance fig 3 c except for qrgs the total relative abundances of other types of args or mges showed decreasing trends the potential possible reason might be that the continuous pressure of atmac c16 on pn a system made the microorganisms produce qrgs through genetic mutations and then the qrgs were enriched though horizontal or vertical transfer previous study proposed that antibiotics sulfamethoxazole and enrofloxacin can select their corresponding args sul and tet during wastewater treatment process li et al 2020a zhang et al 2016a atmac c16 a type of surfactant might not cause the enrichment of other types of resistance genes including args i e sul tet and mges i e inti1 and tp614 but reduce their relative abundances previous study also found that surfactant rhamnolipid and tween 80 decreases the relative abundances of args and inti1 zhang et al 2016b which was similar to the efficacy of atmac c16 in addition the overall pattern of resistance gene profile revealed by pcoa was significantly shifted from seed to pn6 under the increasing pressure of atmac c16 with the coordinate1 and coordinate2 of 77 3 and 16 7 respectively fig 3 d simper analysis showed that qrgs contributed the most 66 38 to the evolution of resistance gene profile and followed by sulfonamides related resistance gene 30 37 indicating that qrgs were mainly responsible for shaping the profile of resistance genes all the args and qrgs were divided into three categories according to the resistance mechanism zhang et al 2016a fig 3 e antibiotic deactivation aac 6 ib aada strb erea and apha efflux pumps qace qacedelta1 01 qacedelta1 02 qach 01 qach 02 and tetg and cellular protection sul1 sul2 sul3 teta tetq and ermf obviously resistance genes with mechanism of efflux pumps had the highest total relative abundance efflux pumps as a transport protein pandey et al 2020 has the function of excreting toxic substrates such as antibiotics from intracellular space to the external environment webber 2003 the enrichments of efflux pumps encoding genes might explain the decreases of most types of args the relative abundances of most resistance genes in seed were high which might be due to that seed was developed from the initially inoculated aerobic granular sludge the aerobic granular sludge itself may harbor a considerable number of various resistance genes during its formation process li et al 2020c and probably had adsorbed a certain amount of residual toxic substances such as antibiotics presented in wastewater resistance genes with efflux pumps mechanism might promote the efflux of background toxic substances and reduce the frequency of induction of several resistance genes previous study also proposed that mechanisms of efflux pumps play important role in resisting qacs tandukar et al 2013 the tolerance of pn a system to atmac c16 was enhanced mainly through inducing the efflux pumps encoding genes qach 01 02 3 4 spread and co occurrence module of resistance genes and the tracking of potential hosts the pn a system presented significant differences in various types of resistance genes p 0 05 before and after loading treatments fig 4 a qrgs seemed to be more susceptible to fluctuations in the face of atmac c16 than other types of resistance genes and followed by sulfonamide related resistance genes the potential reason for that might be due to the different spread module for instance fig 4 b except for qrgs all the other args were significantly positively correlated pearson s r 0 9845 p 0 01 with mges tp614 inti1 and inti3 while for qrgs they had positive correlation with is613 pearson s r 0 8509 p 0 01 hgt might act as an important role to cause the spread of most resistance genes in the pn a system pn a system based on biofilm had compact and density microorganism which increases the opportunity for microorganisms to contact each other and is conducive to the occurrence of hgt yang et al 2013 however the hgt of qrgs and args were conducted by different mges except for the mechanism of efflux pumps the decreasing of args might be caused by mges tp614 inti1 and inti3 which might be a common phenomenon and also observed in other environments such as membrane bioreactors yang et al 2013 swine farms zhu et al 2013b and soil chen et al 2017 in present study sulfonamide related resistance genes as the most dominant args were significantly positively correlated with integrons inti1 and inti3 fig 4 c previous studies also found similar relationships between suls and integrons li et al 2020a subirats et al 2018 suls are difficult to be removed and frequently detected in various environments chen and zhang 2013 and they also have a certain positive co selection relationship with qrgs qacedelta1 01 and qacedelta1 02 fig 4 d it was worth noting that qacedeltal 01 and qacedeltal 02 presented opposite trends to qace qach 01 and qach 02 which might be related with the different potential microbial hosts and co selection mechanism among qrgs and args as shown in fig 4 e f the co occurrence among bacterial taxon args qrgs mges and biochemical factors atmac c16 ldh and cell viability was analyzed and visualized by network analysis network is an appropriate analytical method for tracking the possible potential hosts of resistance genes and is widely conducted to decipher the prospective relationships among various environmental factors microbes and resistance genes in complex environment ling et al 2016 it was obvious that aminoglycoside resistance genes apha strb and aada sulfonamide resistance genes sul1 sul2 and sul3 tetracycline resistance genes teta tetg and tetq and macrolide ermf were positively correlated with inti1 inti3 and tp614 p 0 01 fig 4 e they were carried by these mges and reduced accordingly meanwhile the co occurrence between these args and qacedelta1 01 and qacedelta1 02 were also observed denitratisoma ignavibacterium and nitrosomonas were positively correlated with most args p 0 01 which might be considered as their potential possible microbial hosts the decrease of denitratisoma ignavibacterium and nitrosomonas might mainly be responsible for the reduction of args therefore the co selection between args and qacedelta1 01 02 might mainly be responsible for the decreasing of qacedelta1 01 02 while for qace qach 01 and qach 02 fig 4 f they were found to have positive correlations p 0 01 with many microbial taxa such as candidatus kuenenia candidatus jettenia arenimonas and pseudoxanthomonas these microbes might be the potential possible hosts of qace qach 01 and qach 02 and could resist extreme concentrations 10 mg l of atmac c16 therefore the increase of qace qach 01 and qach 02 might mainly be caused by the atmac c16 resistant strain which gradually be selected and eventually enriched under continuous pressure of atmac c16 and this might be the key reason for the different variation of qacedeltal 01 02 and qach 01 02 in addition qach was reported as a multidrug resistance gene which confers a broader resistance phenotype heir et al 1998 therefore its hosts might have the potential capability of resisting a variety of drugs and thus survive and be enriched there is an inextricable relationship between microbes and resistance genes and the evolution of bacterial population play a key role in altering the profiles of resistance genes chen et al 2016 in present study the results of mantel test bray curtis distance between microbial communities and resistance gene profiles also illuminated that bacterial population was significantly correlated with profiles of resistance genes p 0 05 even though the continuously increasing level of atmac c16 had a certain negative effect on nitrogen removal of pn a system but had a positive impact on the cell viability of overall microbial population there were significant positive correlations p 0 01 among these enriched bacteria fig s2 indicating that they might have reached a synergistic effect initially so that their overall ability to resist atmac c16 might be greater than that of individual therefore the atmac c16 strains was pure cultured and identified for further qac resistance research 3 5 isolation identification and oligotyping analysis of atmac c16 resistant strain at the end of stage 6 10 mg l some typical biofilm on the carrier and a certain amount of effluent were sampled and fully mixed after vortexing and sonicating which allowed the target resistant strains to be fully suspended in the liquid after 24 72 h of incubation 37 c only one resistant strain was successfully isolated fig 5 a and identified as pseudoxanthomonas mexicana sequence id cp060028 1 query cover 99 e value 0 0 by ncbi fig 5 b this species belonged to genus pseudoxanthomonas which was enriched from 0 39 in seed to 2 31 in pn6 and it might have the ability to resist 10 mg l atmac c16 previous study reported that pseudoxanthomonas sp has the ability of biosurfactant production nayak et al 2009 which might grant it the innate ability to resist atmac c16 pseudomonas species is enriched after the long term exposure of aerobic microbial communities to bacs and found to be the bac resistant species hora et al 2020 tandukar et al 2013 network analysis also revealed that pseudoxanthomonas had significant positive correlation with qach 01 and qach 02 fig 4 f and it might be the potential host harboring qrgs furthermore the open reading frame orf of the complete sequence of pseudoxanthomonas mexicana was explored by ncbi and two orfs were found fig s3 the base position from 34 174 named as orf1 the longest orf was aligned to antibacterial biocide metalresistance genes bacmet version 2 0 database http bacmet biomedicine gu se the comparison result showed that orf1 was considered to have the function of encoding the protein of multidrug efflux system trans membrane the resistance of pseudoxanthomonas mexicana to 10 mg l atmac c16 might not only be obtained capturing the qach gene but also benefit from its own efflux pump system which made it have a certain ability to resist the invasion of contaminant previous study also reported the elevation in resistance is mainly attributed to the selection of bacteria that carry efflux pumps elements hora et al 2020 in addition the oligotyping analysis was performed and displayed in fig 5 c oligotyping is often used to deciphered the ecotypes of various microbes eren et al 2014 kleindienst et al 2016 for pseudoxanthomonas its total distribution of oligotypes presented decreasing trends during the whole process of pn a system in addition cta and tgc were observed to be the dominant oligotypes of pseudoxanthomonas indicating that these two oligotypes might play important roles in resisting atmac c16 not only that the oligotypes of other bacteria fig s4 such as hyphomicrobium arenimonas and dongia also presented the similar trends especially in samples pn5 and pn6 which was applied with the high and extreme level of atmac c16 respectively it seemed that decreasing trends of oligotyping distribution might be conducive to the survival of these atmac c16 resistant strains notably the survival of these atmac c16 resistant strains strengthened the ability of pn a to resist level up to 10 mg l atmac c16 however from the perspective of the transmission of resistance genes especially for qrgs these atmac c16 resistant strains might also provide the possibility for the pn a to cause a certain degree of resistance gene transmission which should be taken seriously 4 conclusion the environmental 0 5 mg l and extreme 10 mg l levels of atmac c16 might affect the nitrogen removal performance mainly by inhibiting the anammox hzsb gene atmac c16 allowed candidatus jettenia 2 62 and candidatus kuenenia 0 13 to survive to maintain good nitrogen removal performance and might enhance the cell viability of pn a system atmac c16 seemed to be easier to select qrgs and decrease the abundance of most args efflux pumps encoding genes qach contributed to the tolerance of pn a system to 10 mg l atmac c16 microbial hosts dynamic and co selection mechanism among args and qrgs contributed to the fates of qacedeltal 01 02 and qach 01 02 respectively pseudoxanthomonas mexicana was the only successfully isolated atmac c16 resistant strain in present study which might be the host harboring qach pn a system presented good tolerance in the face of various levels of atmac c16 however the propagation of qrgs and atmac c16 resistant strain in the system should not be ignored in terms of practical application the resistant strain pseudoxanthomonas mexicana could be massively purified and isolated and used as a type of biological enhancer in pn a system to strengthen its resistance to the attack of atmac c16 declaration of

16053,hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride atmac c16 is a kind of quaternary ammonium compound qacs which is extensively consumed as disinfectants antimicrobials and surfactants here the partial nitrification anammox pn a system was exposed to different levels of atmac c16 0 10 mg l and the main objective was to reveal the long term microbiological responses of pn a system to atmac c16 importantly explore the tolerance of pn a to atmac c16 and the key resistant strain nitrogen removal efficiency was influenced by environmental and extreme levels of atmac c16 through mainly affecting the anammox hzsb gene two types of anammox candidatus jettenia and candidatus kuenenia were enriched under the pressure of atmac c16 which allowed pn a system to maintain good nitrogen removal performance atmac c16 might cause the hormesis of entire microbial population in pn a system leading to the enhancement of cell viability atmac c16 decreased the relative abundances of most antibiotics resistance genes args but significantly enriched qacs resistance genes qrgs the tolerance of pn a system to atmac c16 might be strengthened by inducing the efflux pumps encoding genes qach 01 02 microbial hosts dynamic and co selection mechanism among args and qrgs resulted in the opposite trends of qacedeltal 01 02 and qach 01 02 pseudoxanthomonas mexicana was identified as the atmac c16 resistant strain and its resistance to 10 mg l atmac c16 might not only obtain by capturing the qach gene but also benefit from its own efflux pump system therefore from the perspective of the transmission of resistance genes especially for qrgs the spread risk of qrgs and atmac c16 resistant strain in pn a technique should be taken seriously graphical abstract image graphical abstract

quaternary ammonium compounds qacs have been widely consumed as disinfectants and surfactants worldwide levy and marshall 2004 which are active ingredients in hospital personal care products and household cleaners recent years due to the pandemic of covid 19 the usage of qacs is increased significantly to limit the transmission of disease dewey et al 2021 however in addition to being effective component in alleviating the burden of disease or virus qacs seem to result in negative impacts on human health and the environment hora et al 2020 for instance the increased consumption of qacs can increase the loads to wastewater treatment plants and further raise the opportunity of qacs being discharged into the external environment agathokleous et al 2022 although a considerable amount of qacs can be removed in wastewater treatment plants residual qacs of 20 300 μg l in effluent have been detected hora and arnold 2020 especially qacs are detected at level up to mg l in effluent of hospital di nica et al 2017 hora et al 2020 and more seriously qacs are found to be up to 10 times effluent level in influent wastewater and adsorbed to activated sludge hora et al 2020 therefore monitoring of exposure of biological treatment processes in wastewater treatment plants to qacs is helpful to comprehend their biological toxicity to microorganisms and risk assessment of bio accumulation potential hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride atmac c16 is a major type of qacs and found to be contained in cosmetics and hair conditioners zheng et al 2021 which is also frequently detected in the environment and exhibits considerable antimicrobial activities zheng et al 2021 up to now most studies focused on the interaction between benzylalkyldimethylammonium compounds bacs and biological treatment processes in wastewater treatment plants for example previous study found that bacs can be transformed during process of denitrification and nitrate can still be reduced to n2 under pressure of 25 mg l bac tezel and pavlostathis 2009 chen et al found that 5 0 mg l of bac decreases ammonium removal efficiency and causes membrane fouling in membrane bioreactors chen et al 2018 however little is known about the potential impacts of atmac c16 on activated sludge and performance of biological wastewater treatment processes especially on partial nitrification anammox pn a system pn a technique as one of the most innovative wastewater biological treatment process lackner et al 2014 has already been recognized as a sustainable biological process for nitrogen removal li et al 2020d pn a system has a micro aerobic environment and provides ideal environment for the survival of anammox and other functional bacteria which might cause the emergence of many complicated and unneglected variations in the presence of atmac c16 it is still unknown that how atmac c16 with different levels affect the system performance by affecting the functional microorganisms and overall microbial activity previous study proposed that too high level of qacs can inhibit the microbial activity tandukar et al 2013 while too low level of qacs may not be used as carbon source by microorganisms hora et al 2020 therefore exploring the multi directional impacts of atmac c16 on nitrogen removal functional microbes and genes of pn a system at microbiological level is of great meaningful to fill the gap in the insights of interaction mechanism between atmac c16 and pn a system furthermore in subsequent practical applications when pn a system encounters water quality fluctuations caused by different concentrations of atmac c16 the fundamental causes of n removal performance and microbial activity responses can be quickly identified and effectively dealt with the excessive consumption of qacs may not only cause the proliferation of qacs resistant bacteria but also develop antibiotic resistance bacteria agathokleous et al 2022 most studies on qacs resistance and cross resistance focused on bacs previous study found that the resistance of an aerobic sediment microbial system to bacs and several antibiotics tetracycline and ciprofloxacin is simultaneously enhanced after exposing to sub inhibitory levels of bacs tandukar et al 2013 another research was that co resistance is responsible for the emergence of antibiotic resistance namely bacs resistance genes and antibiotic resistance genes args are co located in a same host sequence hora et al 2020 studies found that bacs can decrease the susceptibility of some species to several antibiotics but several studies loughlin et al 2002 merchel and tagkopoulos 2019 also reached the opposite conclusion i e the susceptibility of microbes to antibiotics is increased however the research on the resistance of atmac c16 to microorganism in activated sludge and the corresponding resistant strain was still in deficiency especially for pn a system based on biofilm in this study it had high density of biomass complex microorganisms and a changeable microbial environment atmac c16 related resistance genes such as qac genes might be induced by atmac c16 and spread through horizontal gene transfer hgt depending on cell to cell contact of such dense microbial population which need to be explored and clarified importantly whether the qac genes are harbored in atmac c16 resistant strains and by what mode of transmission hgt or co selection in the pn a system has not been reported in previous studies previous study also proposed that integrons inti1 harbor qac genes encoding efflux pump amos et al 2018 which grant the microbes to capture other args through hgt in addition to integrons other mobile genetic elements mges such as transposases are also reported to be associated with qac genes merchel and tagkopoulos 2019 therefore the long term impacts of atmac c16 on the fates of args qacs related resistance genes qrgs mges and the corresponding resistant microbes in pn a system need to be deeply explored in this study pn a system was successively applied with atmac c16 to explore the responses of system performances and the ability of tolerance to different concentrations of atmac c16 in addition to the nitrogen removal performance and the corresponding functional genes the reactive oxygen species ros cell viability and lactate dehydrogenase ldh were also determined throughout the operational process to assess the microbial activity in the presence of atmac c16 importantly the qrgs and the resistance mechanisms were revealed to evaluate the emergence risk of qrgs furthermore the enriched bacteria under 10 mg l atmac c16 were isolated and identified by method of pure culture to decipher the specific atmac c16 resistant strain which might be the hosts harboring qac this study might provide comprehensive insights on the interactions between various levels of atmac c16 and pn a system especially on the propagation of qrgs and atmac c16 resistant strain in pn a technique in the practical application of pn a it might make it possible to identify the propagation pattern of qrgs and args and then carry out the corresponding risk management 2 materials and methods 2 1 operation of pn a system in present study pn a system has been successfully started up and already running for a period in a cylindrical lab sequencing batch reactor with the total effective volume of 8 l initially aerobic granular sludge from a pilot scale sequencing batch reactor li et al 2020b was selected as the inoculated sludge due to its excellent solid liquid separation performance and long sludge retention time it was used for the initial biofilm formation and start up of pn a system the biofilm carriers were biowater technology bwtx which were strung together by strings and fixed on a stainless steel frame with the filling ratio of 70 during the stable operation of the pn a system the dissolved oxygen level and temperature was maintained at 1 5 mg l and 30 2 c respectively based on the stable pn a system atmac c16 was applied to this pn a system with the increasing level from 0 5 to 10 mg l the atmac c16 was divided into four grades low concentration i e environmental concentration 0 5 mg l moderate concentration 1 0 and 2 0 mg l high concentration 5 0 mg l and extreme concentration 10 mg l the pn a system was operated to treat the synthetic wastewater which consisted of 70 mg l ammonium nitrogen nh4 n 15 mg l orthophosphate po4 3 p and 1 25 g l nahco3 2 2 sample collection and microbiological analysis seven sludge samples named as seed pn1 pn2 pn3 pn4 pn5 and pn6 were collected during the whole pn a operational process which was divided into six stages in detail pn a system was in a steady nitrogen removal state before the addition of atmac c16 which was defined as stage 1 the process of adding 0 5 1 0 2 0 5 0 and 10 mg l atmac c16 was considered as stage 2 3 4 5 and 6 respectively the initial seed sludge sample was named as seed not the original aerobic granular sludge sample but the sludge sample corresponding to the first successful start up of the pn a system sample pn1 6 was collected at the end of stage 1 6 respectively in addition water samples were collected for the measure of nh4 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n and nitrate nitrogen no3 n every 3 4 days according to the standard methods apha 2005 a part of sludge sample was collected to execute the biochemical analysis such as ros cell viability and ldh within 2 h another part of sludge was used to extract dna to determine the key functional genes involved in pn a system including ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob amoa gene denitrifying bacteria dnb genes nirg nirs and nosz and anammox hzsb genes all the primers of functional genes were given table s1 for further microbial genome level analysis illumina novaseq pe250 platform was used for the high throughput sequencing normalization reads of 77 170 sequences based on the 16s rrna gene v3 v4 region and the data was uploaded to sequence read archive with the accession number of prjna781670 2 3 determination of cellular enzyme activity of pn a system to clarify the damage of atmac c16 to microorganisms in pn a system the cellular enzyme activity including ros cell viability and ldh were detected under atmac c16 load with continuous gradient increase for the ros level it was measured by a ros assay kit beyotime china which selected 2 7 dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate as a fluorescent probe moreover the cell viability was determined by cell counting kit 8 cck 8 kit beyotime china according to the kit instructions ldh was determined by ldh cytotoxicity assay kit beyotime china a microplate detector pt 3502b china with 96 well plates was applied to detect the ros excitation wavelength 488 nm emission wavelength 525 nm cell viability wavelength of 450 nm and ldh wavelength of 490 nm 2 4 atmac c16 resistance assessment to estimate the tolerance of pn a system to atmac c16 five qrgs including qace qacedelta1 01 02 and qach 01 02 were investigated for args the target args selected in this study covered the resistance genes corresponding to many common antibiotics including four aminoglycoside resistance genes aac 6 ib aada strb and apha two macrolide resistance genes erea and ermf three sulfonamide resistance genes sul1 sul2 and sul3 and three tetracycline resistance genes teta tetg and tetq these args were also used to explore the co selection relationships with qrgs meanwhile three types of mges including a transposase tp614 two integrons inti1 and inti3 and an insertion is613 which included some important types of mges were investigated to assess the risk of propagating of qrgs through the way of hgt the detail primers of all the args qrgs and mges were listed table s1 all the real time qpcr of resistance genes were conducted on wafergen smartchip real time pcr system in technical triplicates the detailed amplification procedure and the calculation of the relative abundance of resistance genes were according to previous studies zhu et al 2013a zhu et al 2017 2 5 identification and isolation of atmac c16 resistance bacteria to further identify the microorganisms resistant to atmac c16 a micro cosmic experiment was designed and implemented firstly minimal salt medium was prepared by dissolving a group of nutrients including nh4 2so4 2 0 g mgso4 7h2o 0 2 g cacl2 2h2o 0 01 g feso4 7h2o 0 001 g na2hpo4 12h2o 1 5 g kh2po4 1 5 g and agar 18 g in 1 l distilled water after that minimal salt medium was sterilized and added with atmac c16 10 mg l and then it was poured into several sterile petri dishes for standby secondly appropriate amount of sludge was collected and settled naturally for 30 min hence 1 0 ml supernatant was diluted 10 100 and 1000 times then they were applied on petri dishes thirdly different morphologies of colonies growing in the petri dishes were selected for further purification and the purified products were sequenced and finally compared in the national center for biotechnology information ncbi database to obtain the information of target strains these isolated strains would be considered as atmac c16 resistant strains which might be helpful to the risk assessment of drug resistance in pn a system 2 6 oligotypes identification for the resistant taxa the oligotypes of target resistant taxa obtained from results of high throughput sequencing were analyzed to further identify the base sequences which were possibly involved in qacs resistance mechanism the analysis procedure of oligotypes performed on quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime was based on 98 of operational taxonomic unit otu division level shannon entropy was calculated through analyze entropy script in the oligotyping pipeline based on the sequencing results of qacs resistant bacteria the calculation procedure of oligotyping for qacs resistance taxon was kept operating until the oligotypes purity score 100 reads was 0 90 and more specific information of analysis procedures for oligotypes were presented in previous research eren et al 2014 2 7 bioinformatics analysis mantel test was implemented in pcord 5 to clarify the correlations between resistance genes profile and bacterial population paleontological statistics past was adopted to generate principal coordinate analysis pcoa similarity percentage simper analysis one way anova and redundancy analysis rda tbtools chen et al 2020 was applied to create heat map the correlations between bacterial taxa and resistance genes were revealed by spearman s rank correlation coefficients srccs afterwards cytoscape 3 3 0 was applied to create the network visualization among args qrgs and mges at the same time the co occurrence pattern between potential degrading bacteria and qrgs was established 3 results and discussion 3 1 performances variation of pn a and the fates of n related functional genes the environmental atmac c16 0 5 mg l significantly p 0 05 affected the nh4 n and tin removal efficiencies fig 1 a b the potential reason might be that pn a system had never been exposed to atmac c16 before when the system suddenly suffered from the atmac c16 for the first time the nitrogen removal efficiency could be significantly impacted even the concentration of atmac c16 was low however they gradually recovered not only that the average nitrogen removal caused by anammox decreased from 74 9 stage 1 to 61 5 stage 2 but recovered to 67 3 and 72 2 in stage 3 and 4 respectively pn a system seemed to be resistant to moderate 1 0 and 2 0 mg l atmac c16 after adapting to 0 5 mg l atmac c16 for a period of time therefore the background concentration of atmac c16 presented in wastewater might not be undesirable to some extent because at least it might grant the pn a system the stronger ability to resist up to 2 0 mg l atmac c16 even under the high level of atmac c16 5 0 mg l stage 5 the average tin loss caused by anammox just only decreased slightly to 64 8 higher than stage 2 indicating that pn a system showed strong adaptability and tolerance to atmac c16 however extreme level 10 mg l of atmac c16 significantly inhibited the nh4 n and tin removal efficiencies in the initial stage 6 the average n loss caused by anammox sharply decreased to 57 2 fig 1 b but eventually recovered to 71 8 although the system had been acclimated by low and medium concentration atmac c16 before the toxic effect of extreme concentration of atmac c16 on pn a system might be significantly improved which might temporarily inhibit the activity of multiple functional microorganisms so as to inhibit the nitrogen removal efficiency in stage 1 5 the proportion of n loss caused by anammox and other pathways such as denitrification accounted for 97 4 and 1 8 of the loss of tin respectively however these two percentages decreased to 88 7 and increased to 7 3 respectively in stage 6 in stage 6 the tin removal of pn a system benefited from the joint effect of anammox process and other pathways all these changes might be related to the variations of a series of functional genes involved in the nitrogen removal in pn a system in present pn a the variation of tin loss had significant positive correlation with n loss caused by anammox r2 0 8414 p 0 01 fig 1 c implying that most n was removed by anammox even under extreme level of atmac c16 meanwhile since there was no carbon source in the pn a system the proportion of n loss caused by other way such as denitrification was very small however extreme level of atmac c16 10 mg l might be considered as a type of carbon source which could be utilized by microorganism which made other nitrogen removal process such as denitrification reinvigorate fig 1 d presented the variations of relative abundances normalized to 16s rrna genes of aob amoa narg nosz nars and hzsb genes the aob amoa gene seemed to be more vulnerable to atmac c16 than other n related genes especially in stage 6 the relative abundances of aob amoa and hzsb genes significantly decreased which might destroy the proportional balance between nh4 n and no2 n and weaken the anammox process fig 1 e showed a schematic diagram of pn a including functional genes and clarified the n removal pathway n removal by anammox or other ways kartal et al 2010 li et al 2019 previous study proposed that the coexistence of aob and anammox bacteria in pn a system is favorable for nitrogen removal chen et al 2019 hzsb was the dominant functional gene accounted for 87 5 91 8 and this pn a had almost no carbon source therefore the impacts of atmac c16 on pn a were mainly achieved by breaking the nitrogen balance and inhibiting anammox bacteria from the perspective of the recovery performance of pn a several atmac c16 resistant bacteria might play a key role in preventing system collapse eventually anammox bacteria could execute the removal of n while resisting atmac c16 however the emergence and disseminate of multi drug resistant genes might also be caused by co selection mechanism among genes li et al 2015 3 2 microbial community response and the corresponding biological activity microbial community as the crucial participants in pn a system would be more or less affected by atmac c16 one of the direct results was the fluctuation of functional genes mentioned above which further affected the performances of the system such as nh4 n or tin and the corresponding removal efficiencies as shown in fig 2 a three types of anammox bacteria candidatus jettenia candidatus kuenenia and candidatus brocadia presented different variational trends in detail candidatus jettenia gradually increased from 0 02 in seed to 2 62 in pn6 along with the addition of atmac c16 with an increase multiple of 130 it could be seen that the relative abundance of candidatus brocadia was surprisingly high in seed 5 32 which might be the key reason why the pn a system could maintain good tin removal performance the proliferation of anammox bacteria were inhibited when pn a system encountered atmac c16 for the first time 0 5 mg l which was consistent with the results of nitrogen removal in fig 1 subsequently due to the strong adaptability of candidatus kuenenia and candidatus brocadia they were significantly enriched in stage of moderate level 1 0 and 2 0 mg l however high 5 0 mg l and extreme levels 10 mg l of atmac c16 sharply inhibited the proliferation of candidatus brocadia and had slight effect on candidatus kuenenia it could be concluded that different concentrations of atmac c16 might lead to differentiation of different types of anammox bacteria candidatus brocadia presented significant difference from candidatus jettenia and candidatus kuenenia fig s1 atmac c16 seemed unable to poison all types of anammox bacteria which made a considerable part of anammox bacteria such as candidatus jettenia candidatus kuenenia survive in pn a system to maintain good nitrogen removal performance although the relative abundance of anammox bacteria was not high on the whole 0 13 2 62 it seemed that this might not affect the nitrogen removal which meant that these finally survived anammox bacteria in pn a system after the addition of atmac c16 were sufficient to undertake nitrogen removal previous study also reported that anammox bacteria with the relative abundance of 0 11 can be responsible for the n loss and improve the nitrogen removal in a full scale municipal wastewater treatment plant li et al 2019 it was worth noting that several bacteria such as arenimonas hyphomicrobium and pseudofulvimonas were enriched eventually in pn6 fig 2 a and they have functions of denitrification wang et al 2021 even though denitratisoma a denitrifiers zhang et al 2019 showed decreasing tendency along with the increase level of atmac c16 the relative abundance of it in pn6 was also comparable to arenimonas hyphomicrobium and pseudofulvimonas hyphomicrobium was reported to have the capability of transforming nitrate to nitrite langone et al 2014 in addition denitrifiers arenimonas has capability of autotrophic metabolisms which can survive in environment with limited carbon source wang et al 2020 the enrichments of these denitrifiers might be one of the reasons of that the nitrogen removal performance of pn a system could be maintained even the anammox bacteria were inhibited as shown in fig 2 b the cell viability of all samples collected at the end of each stage showed increasing trend indicating that the cell viability of the entire microbial community was enhanced after pn a system adapted to each level of atmac c16 the potential reason might be due to the hormesis caused by atmac c16 disinfectant such as qacs hrubec et al 2021 can induce hormesis in microorganisms and furthermore the effect of hormesis may facilitate the development and spread of drug resistance agathokleous et al 2022 cell viability values were measured at the end of each stage which could reflect that pn a system had good adaptability and recovery ability to each atmac c16 concentration even though nh4 n and tin removal efficiencies were significantly inhibited at the beginning of stage 6 extreme level they were restored in the middle and late phases of stage 6 therefore the inhibitions of nh4 n and tin removal efficiencies and the enhanced cell viability of the entire microbial community at extreme level were not contradictory the ros level was enhanced when the pn a system was stimulated by 0 5 2 0 mg l atmac c16 while it decreased gradually under high 5 0 mg l and extreme level 10 mg l of atmac c16 previous study reported that the external toxic substances such as triclosan can stimulate microbial cells to generate oxidative stress response thereby increasing the production of ros lu et al 2018 it could not be neglected that the ros accumulation is responsible for the sharing mechanism of antibacterial drugs which can cause dna damage dharmaraja 2017 li et al 2021b in addition the level of ldh can positively reflect the degree of cell damage or lysis which might cause the release dong et al 2019 and spread of intracellular resistance genes li et al 2021a the variational trend of ldh level in pn a system was similar to that of ros fig 2 b but it did not seem to significantly affect the microbial activity the decreasing microbial diversity observed species might be one of the reasons to that previous study also found similar decreasing trend of microbial community diversity after long term exposure of aerobic microbial system to bacs tandukar et al 2013 several bacteria such as denitrifiers denitratisoma and nitrosomonas aob could not survive and be washed out finally under the pressure of atmac c16 which allowed the remaining bacteria such as drug resistant bacteria to obtain ample living space then it was reasonable to speculate that atmac c16 might change the distribution of qrgs and other types of resistance genes through affecting the microbial population and levels of cell viability ros and ldh 3 3 emergence of resistance genes and the corresponding resistance mechanisms as shown in fig 3 a 76 resistance gene detected in present study decreased eventually only qace qacedeltal 01 02 and is613 were enriched in pn6 in each sample qrgs were the most dominant resistance genes followed by sulfonamides related resistance gene and mges fig 3 b the total relative abundance of resistance genes was on the rise in general which was determined by qrgs occupying an absolute dominant abundance fig 3 c except for qrgs the total relative abundances of other types of args or mges showed decreasing trends the potential possible reason might be that the continuous pressure of atmac c16 on pn a system made the microorganisms produce qrgs through genetic mutations and then the qrgs were enriched though horizontal or vertical transfer previous study proposed that antibiotics sulfamethoxazole and enrofloxacin can select their corresponding args sul and tet during wastewater treatment process li et al 2020a zhang et al 2016a atmac c16 a type of surfactant might not cause the enrichment of other types of resistance genes including args i e sul tet and mges i e inti1 and tp614 but reduce their relative abundances previous study also found that surfactant rhamnolipid and tween 80 decreases the relative abundances of args and inti1 zhang et al 2016b which was similar to the efficacy of atmac c16 in addition the overall pattern of resistance gene profile revealed by pcoa was significantly shifted from seed to pn6 under the increasing pressure of atmac c16 with the coordinate1 and coordinate2 of 77 3 and 16 7 respectively fig 3 d simper analysis showed that qrgs contributed the most 66 38 to the evolution of resistance gene profile and followed by sulfonamides related resistance gene 30 37 indicating that qrgs were mainly responsible for shaping the profile of resistance genes all the args and qrgs were divided into three categories according to the resistance mechanism zhang et al 2016a fig 3 e antibiotic deactivation aac 6 ib aada strb erea and apha efflux pumps qace qacedelta1 01 qacedelta1 02 qach 01 qach 02 and tetg and cellular protection sul1 sul2 sul3 teta tetq and ermf obviously resistance genes with mechanism of efflux pumps had the highest total relative abundance efflux pumps as a transport protein pandey et al 2020 has the function of excreting toxic substrates such as antibiotics from intracellular space to the external environment webber 2003 the enrichments of efflux pumps encoding genes might explain the decreases of most types of args the relative abundances of most resistance genes in seed were high which might be due to that seed was developed from the initially inoculated aerobic granular sludge the aerobic granular sludge itself may harbor a considerable number of various resistance genes during its formation process li et al 2020c and probably had adsorbed a certain amount of residual toxic substances such as antibiotics presented in wastewater resistance genes with efflux pumps mechanism might promote the efflux of background toxic substances and reduce the frequency of induction of several resistance genes previous study also proposed that mechanisms of efflux pumps play important role in resisting qacs tandukar et al 2013 the tolerance of pn a system to atmac c16 was enhanced mainly through inducing the efflux pumps encoding genes qach 01 02 3 4 spread and co occurrence module of resistance genes and the tracking of potential hosts the pn a system presented significant differences in various types of resistance genes p 0 05 before and after loading treatments fig 4 a qrgs seemed to be more susceptible to fluctuations in the face of atmac c16 than other types of resistance genes and followed by sulfonamide related resistance genes the potential reason for that might be due to the different spread module for instance fig 4 b except for qrgs all the other args were significantly positively correlated pearson s r 0 9845 p 0 01 with mges tp614 inti1 and inti3 while for qrgs they had positive correlation with is613 pearson s r 0 8509 p 0 01 hgt might act as an important role to cause the spread of most resistance genes in the pn a system pn a system based on biofilm had compact and density microorganism which increases the opportunity for microorganisms to contact each other and is conducive to the occurrence of hgt yang et al 2013 however the hgt of qrgs and args were conducted by different mges except for the mechanism of efflux pumps the decreasing of args might be caused by mges tp614 inti1 and inti3 which might be a common phenomenon and also observed in other environments such as membrane bioreactors yang et al 2013 swine farms zhu et al 2013b and soil chen et al 2017 in present study sulfonamide related resistance genes as the most dominant args were significantly positively correlated with integrons inti1 and inti3 fig 4 c previous studies also found similar relationships between suls and integrons li et al 2020a subirats et al 2018 suls are difficult to be removed and frequently detected in various environments chen and zhang 2013 and they also have a certain positive co selection relationship with qrgs qacedelta1 01 and qacedelta1 02 fig 4 d it was worth noting that qacedeltal 01 and qacedeltal 02 presented opposite trends to qace qach 01 and qach 02 which might be related with the different potential microbial hosts and co selection mechanism among qrgs and args as shown in fig 4 e f the co occurrence among bacterial taxon args qrgs mges and biochemical factors atmac c16 ldh and cell viability was analyzed and visualized by network analysis network is an appropriate analytical method for tracking the possible potential hosts of resistance genes and is widely conducted to decipher the prospective relationships among various environmental factors microbes and resistance genes in complex environment ling et al 2016 it was obvious that aminoglycoside resistance genes apha strb and aada sulfonamide resistance genes sul1 sul2 and sul3 tetracycline resistance genes teta tetg and tetq and macrolide ermf were positively correlated with inti1 inti3 and tp614 p 0 01 fig 4 e they were carried by these mges and reduced accordingly meanwhile the co occurrence between these args and qacedelta1 01 and qacedelta1 02 were also observed denitratisoma ignavibacterium and nitrosomonas were positively correlated with most args p 0 01 which might be considered as their potential possible microbial hosts the decrease of denitratisoma ignavibacterium and nitrosomonas might mainly be responsible for the reduction of args therefore the co selection between args and qacedelta1 01 02 might mainly be responsible for the decreasing of qacedelta1 01 02 while for qace qach 01 and qach 02 fig 4 f they were found to have positive correlations p 0 01 with many microbial taxa such as candidatus kuenenia candidatus jettenia arenimonas and pseudoxanthomonas these microbes might be the potential possible hosts of qace qach 01 and qach 02 and could resist extreme concentrations 10 mg l of atmac c16 therefore the increase of qace qach 01 and qach 02 might mainly be caused by the atmac c16 resistant strain which gradually be selected and eventually enriched under continuous pressure of atmac c16 and this might be the key reason for the different variation of qacedeltal 01 02 and qach 01 02 in addition qach was reported as a multidrug resistance gene which confers a broader resistance phenotype heir et al 1998 therefore its hosts might have the potential capability of resisting a variety of drugs and thus survive and be enriched there is an inextricable relationship between microbes and resistance genes and the evolution of bacterial population play a key role in altering the profiles of resistance genes chen et al 2016 in present study the results of mantel test bray curtis distance between microbial communities and resistance gene profiles also illuminated that bacterial population was significantly correlated with profiles of resistance genes p 0 05 even though the continuously increasing level of atmac c16 had a certain negative effect on nitrogen removal of pn a system but had a positive impact on the cell viability of overall microbial population there were significant positive correlations p 0 01 among these enriched bacteria fig s2 indicating that they might have reached a synergistic effect initially so that their overall ability to resist atmac c16 might be greater than that of individual therefore the atmac c16 strains was pure cultured and identified for further qac resistance research 3 5 isolation identification and oligotyping analysis of atmac c16 resistant strain at the end of stage 6 10 mg l some typical biofilm on the carrier and a certain amount of effluent were sampled and fully mixed after vortexing and sonicating which allowed the target resistant strains to be fully suspended in the liquid after 24 72 h of incubation 37 c only one resistant strain was successfully isolated fig 5 a and identified as pseudoxanthomonas mexicana sequence id cp060028 1 query cover 99 e value 0 0 by ncbi fig 5 b this species belonged to genus pseudoxanthomonas which was enriched from 0 39 in seed to 2 31 in pn6 and it might have the ability to resist 10 mg l atmac c16 previous study reported that pseudoxanthomonas sp has the ability of biosurfactant production nayak et al 2009 which might grant it the innate ability to resist atmac c16 pseudomonas species is enriched after the long term exposure of aerobic microbial communities to bacs and found to be the bac resistant species hora et al 2020 tandukar et al 2013 network analysis also revealed that pseudoxanthomonas had significant positive correlation with qach 01 and qach 02 fig 4 f and it might be the potential host harboring qrgs furthermore the open reading frame orf of the complete sequence of pseudoxanthomonas mexicana was explored by ncbi and two orfs were found fig s3 the base position from 34 174 named as orf1 the longest orf was aligned to antibacterial biocide metalresistance genes bacmet version 2 0 database http bacmet biomedicine gu se the comparison result showed that orf1 was considered to have the function of encoding the protein of multidrug efflux system trans membrane the resistance of pseudoxanthomonas mexicana to 10 mg l atmac c16 might not only be obtained capturing the qach gene but also benefit from its own efflux pump system which made it have a certain ability to resist the invasion of contaminant previous study also reported the elevation in resistance is mainly attributed to the selection of bacteria that carry efflux pumps elements hora et al 2020 in addition the oligotyping analysis was performed and displayed in fig 5 c oligotyping is often used to deciphered the ecotypes of various microbes eren et al 2014 kleindienst et al 2016 for pseudoxanthomonas its total distribution of oligotypes presented decreasing trends during the whole process of pn a system in addition cta and tgc were observed to be the dominant oligotypes of pseudoxanthomonas indicating that these two oligotypes might play important roles in resisting atmac c16 not only that the oligotypes of other bacteria fig s4 such as hyphomicrobium arenimonas and dongia also presented the similar trends especially in samples pn5 and pn6 which was applied with the high and extreme level of atmac c16 respectively it seemed that decreasing trends of oligotyping distribution might be conducive to the survival of these atmac c16 resistant strains notably the survival of these atmac c16 resistant strains strengthened the ability of pn a to resist level up to 10 mg l atmac c16 however from the perspective of the transmission of resistance genes especially for qrgs these atmac c16 resistant strains might also provide the possibility for the pn a to cause a certain degree of resistance gene transmission which should be taken seriously 4 conclusion the environmental 0 5 mg l and extreme 10 mg l levels of atmac c16 might affect the nitrogen removal performance mainly by inhibiting the anammox hzsb gene atmac c16 allowed candidatus jettenia 2 62 and candidatus kuenenia 0 13 to survive to maintain good nitrogen removal performance and might enhance the cell viability of pn a system atmac c16 seemed to be easier to select qrgs and decrease the abundance of most args efflux pumps encoding genes qach contributed to the tolerance of pn a system to 10 mg l atmac c16 microbial hosts dynamic and co selection mechanism among args and qrgs contributed to the fates of qacedeltal 01 02 and qach 01 02 respectively pseudoxanthomonas mexicana was the only successfully isolated atmac c16 resistant strain in present study which might be the host harboring qach pn a system presented good tolerance in the face of various levels of atmac c16 however the propagation of qrgs and atmac c16 resistant strain in the system should not be ignored in terms of practical application the resistant strain pseudoxanthomonas mexicana could be massively purified and isolated and used as a type of biological enhancer in pn a system to strengthen its resistance to the attack of atmac c16 declaration of

16054,advanced oxidation processes aops have been increasingly studied and practiced for micropollutant abatement in drinking water treatment and potable water reuse this study conducted the multi angle comparison of the uv chlorine uv monochloramine uv nh2cl and uv chlorine dioxide uv clo2 aops with respect to reactive species generation micropollutant degradation byproduct formation and toxicity change the concentrations of radicals ho cl and clo generated in the three aops followed the order of uv chlorine uv nh2cl uv clo2 at an oxidant dose of 70 μm an irradiation wavelength of 254 nm and a ph of 7 5 the concentration of ozone generated in the uv clo2 aop was higher than that in the uv chlorine aop while ozone was not generated in the uv nh2cl aop the effects of ph ph 6 0 7 5 and 9 0 and uv wavelength 254 nm 285 nm and 300 nm on the three aops were evaluated and compared using the radical and ozone concentrations determined in this study the pseudo first order degradation rate constants of 24 micropollutants by the three aops were predicted and compared when the three aops were used to treat the water containing the same concentration of natural organic matter the formation of total organic chlorine tocl and the organic byproduct associated toxicity followed the same order of uv chlorine uv nh2cl uv clo2 on the contrary the inorganic byproduct associated toxicity followed the order of uv clo2 uv chlorine uv nh2cl due to the high concentrations of chlorite and chlorate formed in the uv clo2 aop findings in this study offer fundamental information useful for the selection and operation of aops for micropollutant abatement in drinking water treatment and potable water reuse graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords advanced oxidation process chlorine based disinfectants micropollutants disinfection byproducts dbps uv wavelength 1 introduction chlorine based disinfectants including chlorine monochloramine nh2cl and chlorine dioxide clo2 can generate reactive species upon uv irradiation and form the uv chlorine uv nh2cl and uv clo2 advanced oxidation processes aops key reactions for reactive species generation are listed in table s1 cosson and ernst 1994 patton et al 2017 remucal and manley 2016 sun et al 2019 those processes have been studied at bench and pilot scales and are promising for micropollutant abatement in drinking water treatment and potable water reuse because 1 they take advantage of the chlorine based disinfectants and uvc irradiation used for water disinfection 2 only require simple modifications on existing treatment trains and 3 the chemicals can subsequently be used for residual protection without needing additional quenching or removal alam et al 2008 li et al 2018 sun et al 2019 yin et al 2018ab previous literature has demonstrated that the uv chlorine uv nh2cl and uv clo2 aops can be used to degrade micropollutants in water li et al 2018 liu and hu 2020 patton et al 2017 tian et al 2020 yin et al 2018b however the multi angle comparison of these aops under the comparable and environmentally relevant conditions with respect to reactive species generation micropollutant degradation byproduct formation and the byproduct associated toxicity change has not been well addressed such comparison is essential to offer important information in understanding the advantages and drawbacks of the aops and guiding engineers and water practitioners to select the most effective but least problematic process for micropollutant abatement towards drinking water treatment and potable water reuse a few previous studies compared the three or two of the three aops with respect to the degradation kinetics of specific micropollutants but those comparisons have some intrinsic limitations for example the degradation rate constants of iopamidol by the three aops were reported to follow the order of uv chlorine uv nh2cl uv clo2 under the comparable experimental conditions the same initial oxidant dosage of 200 µm under the irradiation of low pressure uv at 254 nm tian et al 2020 however the initial dosage of the three oxidants was 200 µm which is unrealistically high for drinking water treatment or potable water reuse in another study the uv chlorine aop was reported to have higher degradation efficiency for benzotriazole tolyltriazole and desethylatrazine than the uv clo2 aop under the comparable experimental conditions the same initial oxidant dosage of 6 0 mg l 1 under the irradiation of low pressure uv at 254 nm while the mechanisms responsible for the better performance of the uv chlorine aop over the uv clo2 aop were not discussed sichel et al 2011 the uv chlorine aop was reported to be more efficient than the uv nh2cl aop in degrading diatrizoate the same initial oxidant dosage of 25 µm under the irradiation of low pressure uv at 254 nm but less efficient than the uv nh2cl aop in degrading benzoate and 1 4 dioxane the same initial oxidant dosage of 70 µm under the irradiation of low pressure uv at 254 nm chuang et al 2017 wu et al 2019 it should be noted that the previous comparisons of different aops were all limited to the degradation of one or a few specific micropollutants such comparisons might be bias towards a specific aop due to the specific reactivity of the tested micropollutant s towards specific reactive species to overcome this limitation this study herein proposed to compare the steady state concentrations of reactive species generated in the three aops which can be further used to calculate and predict the pseudo first order degradation rate constants of any micropollutants as long as the second order rate constants of the micropollutant towards the reactive species e g ho cl clo and ozone and the chlorine based disinfectants chlorine nh2cl and clo2 are available in the literature the concentrations of reactive species in the aops are affected by several operational and environmental factors such as uv wavelength and ph guo et al 2017 kwon et al 2020 previous studies reported that the photodecay rate constants of chlorine nh2cl and clo2 were all wavelength dependent cosson and ernst 1994 yin et al 2018aa yin et al 2020 however the differences in the concentrations of reactive species generated in the uv chlorine uv nh2cl and uv clo2 aops at the same uv wavelength other than 254 nm remain largely unknown ph significantly affects chlorine speciation and reactive species generation in the uv chlorine aop bulman et al 2019 while its impact on the reactive species generation in the uv nh2cl and uv clo2 aops seems less significant kong et al 2021 yin et al 2020 however the differences in the concentrations of reactive species generated in the three aops at the same ph other than ph 7 0 are unclear the formation of undesired byproducts remains a concern of aops especially when the processes involve chlorine based disinfectants such as chlorine nh2cl and clo2 bulman and remucal 2020 kong et al 2021 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 it has been reported that the total concentrations of trichloromethane dichloroacetonitrile trichloroacetonitrile trichloroacetaldehyde and trichloronitromethane formed from iopamidol degradation in the three aops followed the order of uv chlorine uv nh2cl uv clo2 tian et al 2020 in another study the uv nh2cl aop was reported to generate lower concentrations of trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids in degrading 1 6 mg l 1 of ibuprofen or naproxen compared to the uv chlorine aop at the same oxidant dosage of 300 µm li et al 2020 however the abovementioned comparisons can hardly reflect the real world practice because the oxidant dosage 200 300 µm or micropollutant dosage 1 6 mg l 1 in those studies are unrealistically high moreover the micropollutants are not the major precursor of the undesired byproducts because their concentrations in real surface water or drinking water are usually low ng l 1 µg l 1 guo et al 2018 instead the dissolved organic matter dom with a concentration level of mg l 1 is the major precursor of the undesired byproducts formed in the three aops sun et al 2019 however the comparisons of the formation of organic byproducts from dom as well as the byproduct associated toxicity in the three aops remain unaddressed undesired inorganic byproducts e g chlorite chlorate nitrite or nitrate have also been reported to be generated from uv photolysis of chlorine nh2cl or clo2 cosson and ernst 1994 kishimoto 2019 kong et al 2021 li and blatchley 2009 the formation of inorganic byproducts as well as the inorganic byproduct associated toxicity in the uv chlorine uv nh2cl and uv clo2 aops have never been compared either this study was thus designed to fill the knowledge gaps as aforementioned by conducting multi angle comparisons among the uv chlorine uv nh2cl and uv clo2 aops the reactive species concentrations in the three aops were determined and compared and used to predict the degradation rate constants of 24 micropollutants with relatively high occurrence in surface water guo et al 2018 luo et al 2014 mathon et al 2021 the comparison was also made with varied phs ph 6 0 7 5 and 9 0 and uv irradiation wavelengths 254 nm 285 nm and 300 nm the concentrations of organic and inorganic byproducts formed in the three aops were determined and compared and used to calculate the toxicity the findings are expected to offer fundamental information useful for the selection and operation of aops for micropollutant abatement in drinking water treatment and potable water reuse 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials chemicals and materials used in this study were described in detail in text s1 in si details of the preparation of stock solutions of chlorine nh2cl and clo2 were shown in text s2 in si 2 2 uv exposure a bench scale uv irradiator consisting of four low pressure uv lamps 254 nm g15t8 10 w sankyo denki housed in a shuttered box with a collimating tube extending from the bottom fig s2 was used in the photochemical experiments at the uv wavelength of 254 nm quasi collimated uv light emitting diode uv led devices aquisense technologies were used in photochemical experiments at the uv wavelength of 285 or 300 nm fig s3 the two wavelengths were chosen because the uv leds at the two wavelengths are with relatively high energy efficiency yin et al 2018aa and both chlorine and clo2 have relatively high absorption coefficients at the two wavelengths fig s4 the emission spectra of the uv leds are shown in fig s5 the average incident fluence rates e0 in the reactor table s2 were measured by the iodide iodate chemical actinometry bolton and linden 2003 rahn 1997 details about incident fluence rate measurement was described in text s3 2 3 experimental procedures a buffered solution of 20 ml was spiked with one of the oxidant stock solutions chlorine nh2cl and clo2 to give an initial oxidant concentration of 70 µm the oxidant dosage level of 70 µm 5 mg l 1 as cl2 was used because it is practical or close to the real operational condition see detailed justification in text s4 the solution was buffered at ph 6 0 and 7 5 using 5 mm phosphate buffer and at ph 9 0 using 5 mm borate buffer 5 μm of nitrobenzene nb benzoic acid ba and 1 4 dimethoxybenzene dmob were added into the reacting solution as probe compounds and their degradation rate constants were used to determine the concentrations of radicals generated from uv photolysis of chlorine nh2cl or clo2 see details of this method in text s5 in si the mixed solution was then exposed to uv light at one of the three uv wavelengths 254 nm 285 nm and 300 nm each time the reactor with a diameter and a height of 60 mm and 16 mm respectively as shown in fig s2 was covered by a quartz sheet to prevent evaporation of chemicals during uv irradiation as the water depth is 0 71 cm fig s2 and the uvt values at corresponding wavelengths are all higher than 90 in this study the photodecay of oxidants was considered to be independent of the depth of the water layer hofman caris et al 2015 samples were collected at pre determined time intervals quenched with freshly prepared sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 at a na2s2o3 to chlorine molar ratio of 1 5 1 and analysed for the residual concentrations of the probe compounds the uv incident time 900 sec might be higher than that in the real practice e g a few sec because it would be very challenging to finish these steps within a very short period time if a high intensity fluence rate uv lamp was used and significant errors might be involved by doing so to determine the concentrations of ozone generated from uv photolysis of chlorine nh2cl or clo2 experiments were conducted in a similar manner except that cinnamic acid was added as the probe compound instead of adding nb ba and dmob see details of this method in text s6 in si forsyth et al 2013 to evaluate the concentrations of inorganic and organic byproducts formed in the three aops experiments were conducted in a similar manner in the absence of probe compounds with adding 1 0 mgc l 1 of suwannee river natural organic matter srnom isolate into the solution samples were collected after 15 min exposure to uv radiation quenched and analysed for the concentrations of inorganic and organic byproducts see details of quenching and sample pre treatment methods in text s7 in si details of the analytical methods for determining the concentrations of oxidants probe compounds and inorganic and organic byproducts are shown in text s8 in si apha awwa wef 2005 all experiments were conducted in duplicate the data were expressed as mean standard deviation of the two duplicate experiments statistical significance p 0 05 was evaluated by one way analysis of variance anova on origin 8 0 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of radical and ozone generation in the three aops 3 1 1 generation of radicals and ozone under the baseline conditions the concentrations of ho cl clo and ozone hereafter referred to as ho ss cl ss clo ss and o3 generated in the uv chlorine uv nh2cl and uv clo2 aops under the baseline conditions oxidant 0 70 µm ph 7 5 uv wavelength 254 nm and uv fluence 306 9 mj cm 2 were determined and compared cl2 was not considered due to its relatively low reactivity towards the probe compounds or micropollutants see detailed explanation in text s9 in si the determined concentrations of radicals and ozone in the three aops are listed in table 1 under the baseline conditions ho ss in the uv chlorine aop was 1 20 and 4 25 times higher than that in the uv nh2cl and uv clo2 aops respectively table 1 p 0 05 cl ss in the uv chlorine aop was 1 16 and 5 79 times higher than that in the uv nh2cl and uv clo2 aops respectively table 1 p 0 05 it should be emphasized that the differences in ho ss and cl ss were still within one order of magnitude therefore the differences in degradation of micropollutants reactive only towards ho and cl are expected to be marginal in the three aops on the other hand clo ss in the uv chlorine aop was much higher 2 orders of magnitudes than the other two aops table 1 therefore the uv chlorine aop would be much more efficient in degrading micropollutants that are highly reactive towards clo e g bezafibrate gemfibrozil and erythromycin guo et al 2018 o3 followed the order of uv clo2 uv chlorine p 0 05 ozone was generated in the uv clo2 aop at a level of 10 7 m which was 6 0 times higher than that in the uv chlorine aop table 1 meanwhile a negligible amount of ozone lower than the detection limit of 5 0 10 9 m was generated in the uv nh2cl aop table 1 ozone was formed from the reaction between dissolved oxygen o2 and the ground state oxygen atom o 3p eq s5 in table s1 bulman et al 2019 the o 3p can be generated from uv photolysis of hypochlorite eq s3 in table s1 or clo2 eq s20 in table s1 but not from nh2cl li and blatchley 2009 this explained why ozone was generated in the uv clo2 and uv chlorine aops but not in the uv nh2cl aop the results suggested that the uv clo2 aop might be more efficient in degrading micropollutants that are highly reactive towards ozone e g 17α ethynylestradiol 17β estradiol and roxithromycin compared to the other two aops huber et al 2003 mathon et al 2021 3 1 2 effect of ph the effect of ph on the radical and ozone concentrations in the three aops were examined and compared oxidant 0 70 µm ph 6 0 7 5 or 9 0 uv wavelength 254 nm and uv fluence 306 9 mj cm 2 at ph 6 0 ho ss cl ss and clo ss in the three aops all followed the general order of uv chlorine uv nh2cl uv clo2 p 0 05 while o3 followed the order of uv clo2 uv chlorine p 0 05 fig 1 and table s3 with increasing ph from 6 0 to 7 5 ho ss cl ss and o3 decreased and clo ss increased in the uv chlorine aop fig s6 p 0 05 while the radical and ozone concentrations in the uv nh2cl and uv clo2 aops were barely changed fig s6 p 0 05 therefore although the ho ss cl ss and clo ss in the three aops still followed the general order of uv chlorine uv nh2cl uv clo2 p 0 05 the difference in ho ss and cl ss between the uv chlorine and the other two aops became smaller while the difference in clo ss became larger o3 still followed the order of uv clo2 uv chlorine p 0 05 fig 1 but the differences between the uv clo2 and the uv chlorine aop became larger further increasing the ph to 9 0 ho ss cl ss and o3 further decreased and clo ss further increased in the uv chlorine aop fig s6 p 0 05 while the radical and ozone concentrations in the uv nh2cl and uv clo2 aops remained unchanged fig s6 p 0 05 consequently the order of ho ss and cl ss changed to uv nh2cl uv chlorine uv clo2 at ph 9 0 ho ss in the uv nh2cl aop 4 62 10 14 m was 1 44 times and 3 42 times higher than that in the uv chlorine 3 21 10 14 m and uv clo2 1 35 10 14 m aops respectively table s3 cl ss in the uv nh2cl aop 7 12 10 15 m was 4 24 times and 5 79 times higher than that in the uv chlorine 1 68 10 15 m and uv clo2 1 23 10 15 m aops respectively table s3 the uv nh2cl aop might perform slightly better than the other two aops for the degradation of micropollutants that are only reactive towards ho ss or cl ss under such conditions while the difference in degradation might be small since the difference in ho ss and cl ss was within one order of magnitude the order of clo ss remained unchanged uv chlorine uv nh2cl uv clo2 but the difference in clo ss became even larger between the uv chlorine and the other two aops fig 1 o3 still followed the order of uv clo2 uv chlorine uv nh2cl fig 1 but the differences between the uv clo2 and the other two aops became even larger in the uv chlorine aop ho ss and cl ss decreased with increasing ph from 6 0 to 9 0 which was mainly attributed to 1 the shift of hocl to ocl with increasing ph pka of hocl is 7 53 and 2 the stronger scavenging effect of ocl than hocl towards ho and cl table s4 chuang et al 2017 o3 in the uv chlorine aop also decreased with increasing ph which was mainly because of the enhanced scavenging effect of ocl on o 3p k o 3 p c l o 9 40 109 m 1 s 1 with increasing ph remucal and manley 2016 in contrast clo ss increased with increasing ph likely because ho and cl were transformed to clo via ocl scavenging eqs s7 and s8 in table s1 the insignificant impact of ph on the radical and ozone concentrations in the uv nh2cl and uv clo2 aops was mainly because nh2cl and clo2 were stable in solution at ph ranging from 6 0 to 9 0 this was supported by the supplementary test results that 5 0 of the nh2cl and clo2 were decayed under the experimental conditions see details in text s10 in si the results suggested that the differences in the degradation of micropollutants that are reactive only towards ho and cl might be marginal within one order of magnitude in the three aops at different phs while the advantage of uv chlorine aop in degrading micropollutants that are highly reactive towards clo became more significant under alkaline conditions the uv clo2 aop may outcompete the uv chlorine aop in degrading micropollutants that are highly reactive towards ozone at different phs the effects of nom bicarbonate and buffers phosphate and borate on the reactive species concentrations in the three aops were also investigated and discussed in text s11 3 1 3 effect of uv wavelength as mentioned in the introduction uv photolysis of chlorine nh2cl and clo2 are all wavelength dependent flesch et al 1999 yin et al 2018aa yin et al 2020 however the comparison of the uv chlorine uv nh2cl and uv clo2 aops at the uv wavelength other than 254 nm remains unaddressed meanwhile new monochromatic uv radiation sources e g uv leds emitting uv light at different wavelengths have emerged as promising alternatives to the conventional mercury based uv lamps chen et al 2017 song et al 2016 therefore the effect of uv wavelength on radical and ozone concentrations in the three aops was evaluated and compared oxidant 0 70 µm ph 7 5 uv wavelength 254 285 or 300 nm the radical and ozone concentrations determined at different uv wavelengths were normalized by uv fluences and the results are shown in fig 2 at a uv irradiation wavelength of 254 nm the radical concentrations in the three aops followed the order of uv chlorine uv nh2cl uv clo2 at uv irradiation wavelengths of 285 nm and 300 nm the radical concentrations followed a different order of uv chlorine uv clo2 uv nh2cl and the differences between the uv chlorine and uv clo2 aops became smaller the ozone concentration in the uv clo2 aop was 6 0 and 1 5 times higher than that in the uv chlorine aop at 254 and 285 nm respectively and it was comparable to that in the uv chlorine aop at 300 nm the different trends of radical concentrations in the three aops at different uv wavelengths were attributed to the different wavelength dependencies of chlorine nh2cl and clo2 as shown in fig s7 the concentrations of radicals ho cl and clo and ozone in the uv chlorine and uv clo2 aops all increased with increasing uv wavelength from 254 to 300 nm p 0 05 in contrast the concentrations of radicals ho cl and clo in the uv nh2cl aop decreased with increasing wavelength from 254 to 300 nm p 0 05 note ozone was not generated in the uv nh2cl aop so it was not discussed consistent with previous findings yin et al 2018a yin et al 2020 the wavelength dependencies on reactive species generation were well supported by the wavelength dependencies on the molar absorption coefficients of chlorine nh2cl and clo2 fig s4 which followed the same trends as the uv wavelength increased from 254 to 300 nm the results suggested that the uv radiation sources at longer uv wavelengths 254 300 nm are promising alternatives to the low pressure uv lamp in driving the uv chlorine and uv clo2 aops the uv clo2 aop can be more efficient than the uv nh2cl aop in generating reactive species at a longer uv wavelength e g 300 nm while it can hardly outcompete the uv chlorine aop 3 2 prediction and comparison of micropollutant degradation in the three aops as many micropollutants are reactive towards the reactive species though to different extents among different micropollutants and different reactive species their degradation rate constants contributed by the reactive species k m p p r e d i c t e d can be calculated and predicted by multiplying the concentrations of the reactive species that were determined in this study with the second order rate constants of the micropollutants towards the reactive species ho cl clo and ozone that were collected from the literature table s5 see detailed calculation methods in text s12 the contribution of the oxidant precursors chlorine nh2cl and clo2 on the micropollutant degradation can also be predicted by multiplying the initial concentrations of the oxidant precursors with the second order rate constants of the micropollutants towards the oxidant precursors table s5 k m p p r e d i c t e d of 24 micropollutants in the three aops are shown in fig 3 based on the predominant contributor s to the degradation the 24 micropollutants were categorized into three groups groups ⅰ ii and iii all the micropollutants exhibit high reactivities towards the radicals ho cl and clo k m p r a d i c a l 106 1010 m 1 s 1 table s5 gan et al 2020 mathon et al 2021 the categorization was thus made based on whether the micropollutants are reactive towards ozone and or the oxidant precursors chlorine nh2cl and clo2 for example micropollutants that exhibit high reactivities towards ozone k m p o z o n e 105 m 1 s 1 and or the oxidant precursors chlorine nh2cl and clo2 k m p o x i d a n t 50 m 1 s 1 are categorized into group i including sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim carbamazepine diclofenac 17β estradiol estrone 17α ethynylestradiol phenol roxithromycin naproxen gemfibrozil and ofloxacin these micropollutants contain electron rich and ozone reactive moieties such as phenol aniline amine and ether oxide groups r1 o r2 mathon et al 2021 muñoz and von sonntag 2000 for those micropollutants the k m p p r e d i c t e d followed the general order of uv clo2 uv chlorine uv nh2cl the only one exception case in group i was ofloxacin the degradation of which followed the order of uv chlorine uv clo2 uv nh2cl this was due to the much higher 80 times reactivity of ofloxacin towards chlorine than clo2 table s5 micropollutants that exhibit moderate reactivity towards ozone k m p o z o n e 103 m 1 s 1 and or the oxidant precursors k m p o x i d a n t 1 0 m 1 s 1 are categorized into group ii including metoprolol erythromycin and atenolol these micropollutants are secondary amines or compounds containing ketone groups which are known to be less reactive towards ozone mathon et al 2021 sharma 2008 the k m p p r e d i c t e d of the micropollutants in group ii followed the order of uv chlorine uv clo2 uv nh2cl micropollutants that exhibit low reactivity towards ozone k m p o z o n e 103 m 1 s 1 and or the oxidant precursors k m p o x i d a n t 1 0 m 1 s 1 are categorized into group iii including theophylline caffeine atrazine metronidazole bezafibrate clofibric acid ibuprofen iopromide and primidone these micropollutants are carboxylic acids amides or compounds containing derivatives of n c n bonds which are known to be refractory to the oxidation by ozone chlorine nh2cl or clo2 mathon et al 2021 the k m p p r e d i c t e d of the micropollutants in group iii followed the order of uv chlorine uv nh2cl uv clo2 to validate the predicted degradation rate constants two micropollutants phenol and ibuprofen were selected and their degradation rate constants were determined via experiments and compared with the predicted ones fig s8 as shown in fig 3 and fig s8 the values obtained from the experiments and the prediction were comparable with differences k e x p k m p p r e d i c t e d k m p p r e d i c t e d smaller than 20 the results suggested that the prediction was well validated against the experimental results and the degradation rate constants of other micropollutants can be predicted by using the method established in this study the above results clearly demonstrated the limitations of comparing different aops by just comparing the degradation rate constants of a specific micropollutant s because such comparison is bias towards a specific aop due to the specific reactivity of the tested micropollutant s towards specific reactive species and or oxidants instead by using the method established in this study the degradation efficiencies of different micropollutants contributed by the reactive species ho cl clo and ozone and the oxidant precursors chlorine nh2cl and clo2 in the three aops can be predicted and compared as long as the second order rate constants of the micropollutants towards the reactive species and oxidant precursors are available 3 3 comparison of byproduct formation and toxicity in the three aops 3 3 1 formation of inorganic byproducts and the associated toxicity formation of undesired byproducts is one of the major concerns of aops in real water treatment practices it is known that some inorganic and organic byproducts can be formed from uv photolysis of chlorine nh2cl and clo2 kong et al 2021 li and blatchley 2009 sun et al 2016 the formation of inorganic byproducts including chlorite clo2 chlorate clo3 nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 in the three aops were examined in the presence of 1 0 mg c l 1 of srnom under the baseline conditions oxidant 0 70 µm ph 7 5 uv wavelength 254 nm and uv fluence 306 9 mj cm 2 clo2 0 20 mg l 1 as clo2 was formed in the uv clo2 aop but it was undetectable lower than the detection limit of 0 015 mg l 1 as clo2 in the uv chlorine and uv nh2cl aops table s6 the molar yield of clo2 in the uv clo2 aop was calculated to be 14 9 the clo2 formation was mainly attributed to the reaction between clo2 and srnom through the one electron transfer pathway gan et al 2019 the concentrations of clo3 formed in the uv chlorine aop 0 10 mg l 1 as clo3 was 44 lower than that in the uv clo2 aop 0 18 mg l 1 as clo3 noted that the background clo3 in the chlorine and clo2 stock solutions was considered and deducted in the calculation table s6 a negligible amount of clo3 lower than the detection limit of 0 015 mg l 1 as clo3 was formed in the uv nh2cl aop in the uv chlorine aop clo3 can only be formed from clo2 oxidation by chlorine and the reactive species cheng et al 2019 remucal and manley 2016b however the formation of clo2 in the uv chlorine aop was very limited and it was below the detection limit 0 015 mg l 1 as clo2 as discussed above in contrast in the uv clo2 aop the reaction between srnom and clo2 could directly generate clo3 molar yield 10 and clo2 molar yield 40 70 gan et al 2019 and clo2 could be further oxidized by the reactive species and or clo2 to form clo3 bulman et al 2019 zuo et al 1997 those explained why the uv chlorine aop formed a lower concentration of clo3 than the uv clo2 aop under the comparable experimental conditions although insignificant amount of clo2 and clo3 was formed in the uv nh2cl aop no2 0 11 mg l 1 as no2 and no3 0 13 mg l 1 as no3 were formed as the byproducts the molar yields of no2 and no3 were calculated to be 17 4 and 15 3 respectively the formation pathways of no2 and no3 during uv photolysis of nh2cl at ph 7 5 in the absence of nom were reported by li and blatchley 2009 with a yield of 44 4 and 9 7 for no2 and no3 respectively the higher yield of no3 in this study might be attributed to the direct formation of no3 from the reactions between nh2cl and srnom vikesland et al 1998 as a radical scavenger no2 generated in the uv nh2cl aop was one of the reasons for the lower concentrations of reactive species in the uv nh2cl aop than those in the uv chlorine aop hofman caris et al 2015 yin et al 2020 although no3 can be photolyzed and generate radicals its effect was negligible considering the low concentration of no3 0 13 mg l 1 as no3 the inorganic byproduct associated additive toxicity was calculated using a toxicity potency weighting method details provided in text s13 in si chuang and mitch 2017 cuthbertson et al 2019 zeng et al 2016 as shown in fig 4 a the inorganic byproduct associated additive toxicity in the three aops followed the order of uv clo2 uv chlorine uv nh2cl the higher inorganic byproduct associated additive toxicity in the uv clo2 aop than that in the uv chlorine aop was consistent with the higher concentrations of clo2 and clo3 formed in the former aop table s6 the much lower inorganic byproduct associated additive toxicity in the uv nh2cl aop compared to the other two aops was attributed to the much lower toxic potencies of no2 no3 than clo2 clo3 table s7 3 3 2 formation of organic byproducts and the associated toxicity the concentrations of organic byproducts formed in the three aops in the presence of 1 0 mg c l 1 of srnom were determined and compared under the baseline conditions oxidant 0 70 µm ph 7 5 uv wavelength 254 nm and uv fluence 306 9 mj cm 2 as shown in fig 4b the concentrations of total organic chlorine tocl formed in the three aops followed the order of uv chlorine uv nh2cl uv clo2 the concentrations of tocl generated from srnom in the uv chlorine 137 6 µg l 1 and uv clo2 31 5 µg l 1 aops were at the same level as the values reported previously under the similar experimental conditions 100 300 µg l 1 in the uv chlorine aop and 30 µg l 1 in the uv clo2 aop kong et al 2021 ruan et al 2021 comparison regarding the concentration of tocl generated from srnom in the uv nh2cl aop was not conducted because the corresponding value was not available in the literature moreover oxidant precursors chlorine nh2cl and clo2 were the main contributors to the tocl formation fig 4b because compared to the cases without uv irradiation the uv chlorine aops only enhanced the tocl formation by 24 1 and the enhancement was insignificant in the other two aops p 0 05 fig 4b the larger enhancement in the uv chlorine aop was consistent with the higher generation of radicals ho cl and clo than the other two aops considering that the radicals ho cl and clo have been reported to enhance the chloro organic byproduct formation from nom lei et al 2021 yeom et al 2021 the concentration of tobr was negligible 1 2 µg l 1 as cl in all treated samples due to the absence of inorganic and organic bromine e g bromide and bromine containing organics in the simulated solution containing 70 µm of oxidants 1 mgc l 1 of srnom and 5 mm of phosphate buffer however in the presence of 0 5 mg l 1 of bromide ion br the concentrations of tox in the uv chlorine and uv clo2 aops were found to be comparable p 0 05 and were much higher than that in the uv nh2cl aop see details in text s14 and fig s9 besides tocl and tobr seven selected chloro organic byproducts including trichloropropanone tcp dichloropropanone dcp dichloroacetonitrile dcan chloral hydrate ch trichloromethane tcm trichloroacetic acid tcaa and dichloroacetic acid dcaa were determined in the three aops fig 4c the summed concentrations of the seven chloro organic byproducts were also at the same level as the value reported previously under the similar experimental conditions kong et al 2021 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 and followed the similar order as tocl concentration uv chlorine uv nh2cl uv clo2 the formation of organic byproducts from the three aops with post oxidation for 24 h were also found to follow the same order uv chlorine uv nh2cl uv clo2 text s15 and fig s10 the toxic potency weighted byproduct concentrations of the seven selected chloro organic byproducts were calculated and the results are shown in fig 4d the organic byproduct associated additive toxicity in the three aops followed the order of uv chlorine uv nh2cl uv clo2 p 0 05 the order was consistent with the tocl concentration and the summed concentrations of the seven selected chloro organic byproducts fig 4c as shown in fig 4d despite the predominance of tcm and dcaa with respect to the mass concentrations in the three aops their contributions to the overall toxicity were much lower on the contrary dcan and ch had dominant contributions to the organic byproduct associated additive toxicity in the three aops transformation products of certain micropollutants may also contribute the toxicity of the treated water aghdam et al 2017 yang et al 2021 while nom contributed more than the transformation products of micropollutants to the toxicity of the treated water see details in text s16 the results demonstrated that although the uv chlorine aop generated higher concentrations of radicals ho cl and clo than the uv nh2cl and uv clo2 aops it also formed higher concentrations of chloro organic byproducts and had higher organic byproduct associated toxicity the intrinsic trade off between radical generation and byproduct formation or toxicity was clearly demonstrated the results also demonstrated that although the uv clo2 aop showed the lowest organic byproduct associated additive toxicity it showed the highest inorganic byproduct associated additive toxicity it should be noted that the inorganic and organic byproduct associated additive toxicities were not summed up in this study because they were reported to show a synergistic relationship rather than the additive relationship though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear han and zhang 2018 the evaluation on the overall toxicity in the three aops by incorporating both organic and inorganic byproduct associated toxicities is recommended for future investigation 4 conclusions this study demonstrated the bright and dark sides of uv photolysis of three chlorine based disinfectants chlorine nh2cl and clo2 by conducting a comparative study with respect to the reactive species generation micropollutant degradation byproduct formation and toxicity change in the uv chlorine uv nh2cl and uv clo2 aops under several environmentally relevant conditions a few practical implications can be drawn from the findings of this study 1 there is no best uv aop there is an intrinsic trade off between radical generation and byproduct formation or toxicity the uv chlorine aop is more efficient in degrading micropollutants that are highly reactive towards radicals ho cl and clo but it is more sensitive to ph of the water and forms higher concentrations of chloro organic byproducts and poses higher organic byproduct associated toxicity the uv clo2 aop is more efficient in degrading micropollutants that are highly reactive towards ozone but it forms higher concentrations of clo2 and clo3 and poses higher inorganic byproduct associated toxicity 2 the reactive species concentrations in the uv clo2 and uv chlorine aops increased with increasing uv wavelength from 254 nm to 300 nm uv leds at longer uv wavelengths e g uvb a ranges are recommended to drive the two aops with consideration of the relatively higher wall plug efficiency and lower cost of uvb a leds compared to the uvc leds kebbi et al 2020 and their mercury free feature 3 although the uv nh2cl aop generates lower concentrations of ho cl and clo than the uv chlorine aop the reactive nitrogen species rns nh2 no and no2 are reported to be generated and contribute to micropollutant degradation wu et al 2019 technological advancements are needed to quantify the concentrations of rns and their contributions to micropollutant degradation byproduct

16054,advanced oxidation processes aops have been increasingly studied and practiced for micropollutant abatement in drinking water treatment and potable water reuse this study conducted the multi angle comparison of the uv chlorine uv monochloramine uv nh2cl and uv chlorine dioxide uv clo2 aops with respect to reactive species generation micropollutant degradation byproduct formation and toxicity change the concentrations of radicals ho cl and clo generated in the three aops followed the order of uv chlorine uv nh2cl uv clo2 at an oxidant dose of 70 μm an irradiation wavelength of 254 nm and a ph of 7 5 the concentration of ozone generated in the uv clo2 aop was higher than that in the uv chlorine aop while ozone was not generated in the uv nh2cl aop the effects of ph ph 6 0 7 5 and 9 0 and uv wavelength 254 nm 285 nm and 300 nm on the three aops were evaluated and compared using the radical and ozone concentrations determined in this study the pseudo first order degradation rate constants of 24 micropollutants by the three aops were predicted and compared when the three aops were used to treat the water containing the same concentration of natural organic matter the formation of total organic chlorine tocl and the organic byproduct associated toxicity followed the same order of uv chlorine uv nh2cl uv clo2 on the contrary the inorganic byproduct associated toxicity followed the order of uv clo2 uv chlorine uv nh2cl due to the high concentrations of chlorite and chlorate formed in the uv clo2 aop findings in this study offer fundamental information useful for the selection and operation of aops for micropollutant abatement in drinking water treatment and potable water reuse graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords advanced oxidation process chlorine based disinfectants micropollutants disinfection byproducts dbps uv wavelength 1 introduction chlorine based disinfectants including chlorine monochloramine nh2cl and chlorine dioxide clo2 can generate reactive species upon uv irradiation and form the uv chlorine uv nh2cl and uv clo2 advanced oxidation processes aops key reactions for reactive species generation are listed in table s1 cosson and ernst 1994 patton et al 2017 remucal and manley 2016 sun et al 2019 those processes have been studied at bench and pilot scales and are promising for micropollutant abatement in drinking water treatment and potable water reuse because 1 they take advantage of the chlorine based disinfectants and uvc irradiation used for water disinfection 2 only require simple modifications on existing treatment trains and 3 the chemicals can subsequently be used for residual protection without needing additional quenching or removal alam et al 2008 li et al 2018 sun et al 2019 yin et al 2018ab previous literature has demonstrated that the uv chlorine uv nh2cl and uv clo2 aops can be used to degrade micropollutants in water li et al 2018 liu and hu 2020 patton et al 2017 tian et al 2020 yin et al 2018b however the multi angle comparison of these aops under the comparable and environmentally relevant conditions with respect to reactive species generation micropollutant degradation byproduct formation and the byproduct associated toxicity change has not been well addressed such comparison is essential to offer important information in understanding the advantages and drawbacks of the aops and guiding engineers and water practitioners to select the most effective but least problematic process for micropollutant abatement towards drinking water treatment and potable water reuse a few previous studies compared the three or two of the three aops with respect to the degradation kinetics of specific micropollutants but those comparisons have some intrinsic limitations for example the degradation rate constants of iopamidol by the three aops were reported to follow the order of uv chlorine uv nh2cl uv clo2 under the comparable experimental conditions the same initial oxidant dosage of 200 µm under the irradiation of low pressure uv at 254 nm tian et al 2020 however the initial dosage of the three oxidants was 200 µm which is unrealistically high for drinking water treatment or potable water reuse in another study the uv chlorine aop was reported to have higher degradation efficiency for benzotriazole tolyltriazole and desethylatrazine than the uv clo2 aop under the comparable experimental conditions the same initial oxidant dosage of 6 0 mg l 1 under the irradiation of low pressure uv at 254 nm while the mechanisms responsible for the better performance of the uv chlorine aop over the uv clo2 aop were not discussed sichel et al 2011 the uv chlorine aop was reported to be more efficient than the uv nh2cl aop in degrading diatrizoate the same initial oxidant dosage of 25 µm under the irradiation of low pressure uv at 254 nm but less efficient than the uv nh2cl aop in degrading benzoate and 1 4 dioxane the same initial oxidant dosage of 70 µm under the irradiation of low pressure uv at 254 nm chuang et al 2017 wu et al 2019 it should be noted that the previous comparisons of different aops were all limited to the degradation of one or a few specific micropollutants such comparisons might be bias towards a specific aop due to the specific reactivity of the tested micropollutant s towards specific reactive species to overcome this limitation this study herein proposed to compare the steady state concentrations of reactive species generated in the three aops which can be further used to calculate and predict the pseudo first order degradation rate constants of any micropollutants as long as the second order rate constants of the micropollutant towards the reactive species e g ho cl clo and ozone and the chlorine based disinfectants chlorine nh2cl and clo2 are available in the literature the concentrations of reactive species in the aops are affected by several operational and environmental factors such as uv wavelength and ph guo et al 2017 kwon et al 2020 previous studies reported that the photodecay rate constants of chlorine nh2cl and clo2 were all wavelength dependent cosson and ernst 1994 yin et al 2018aa yin et al 2020 however the differences in the concentrations of reactive species generated in the uv chlorine uv nh2cl and uv clo2 aops at the same uv wavelength other than 254 nm remain largely unknown ph significantly affects chlorine speciation and reactive species generation in the uv chlorine aop bulman et al 2019 while its impact on the reactive species generation in the uv nh2cl and uv clo2 aops seems less significant kong et al 2021 yin et al 2020 however the differences in the concentrations of reactive species generated in the three aops at the same ph other than ph 7 0 are unclear the formation of undesired byproducts remains a concern of aops especially when the processes involve chlorine based disinfectants such as chlorine nh2cl and clo2 bulman and remucal 2020 kong et al 2021 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 it has been reported that the total concentrations of trichloromethane dichloroacetonitrile trichloroacetonitrile trichloroacetaldehyde and trichloronitromethane formed from iopamidol degradation in the three aops followed the order of uv chlorine uv nh2cl uv clo2 tian et al 2020 in another study the uv nh2cl aop was reported to generate lower concentrations of trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids in degrading 1 6 mg l 1 of ibuprofen or naproxen compared to the uv chlorine aop at the same oxidant dosage of 300 µm li et al 2020 however the abovementioned comparisons can hardly reflect the real world practice because the oxidant dosage 200 300 µm or micropollutant dosage 1 6 mg l 1 in those studies are unrealistically high moreover the micropollutants are not the major precursor of the undesired byproducts because their concentrations in real surface water or drinking water are usually low ng l 1 µg l 1 guo et al 2018 instead the dissolved organic matter dom with a concentration level of mg l 1 is the major precursor of the undesired byproducts formed in the three aops sun et al 2019 however the comparisons of the formation of organic byproducts from dom as well as the byproduct associated toxicity in the three aops remain unaddressed undesired inorganic byproducts e g chlorite chlorate nitrite or nitrate have also been reported to be generated from uv photolysis of chlorine nh2cl or clo2 cosson and ernst 1994 kishimoto 2019 kong et al 2021 li and blatchley 2009 the formation of inorganic byproducts as well as the inorganic byproduct associated toxicity in the uv chlorine uv nh2cl and uv clo2 aops have never been compared either this study was thus designed to fill the knowledge gaps as aforementioned by conducting multi angle comparisons among the uv chlorine uv nh2cl and uv clo2 aops the reactive species concentrations in the three aops were determined and compared and used to predict the degradation rate constants of 24 micropollutants with relatively high occurrence in surface water guo et al 2018 luo et al 2014 mathon et al 2021 the comparison was also made with varied phs ph 6 0 7 5 and 9 0 and uv irradiation wavelengths 254 nm 285 nm and 300 nm the concentrations of organic and inorganic byproducts formed in the three aops were determined and compared and used to calculate the toxicity the findings are expected to offer fundamental information useful for the selection and operation of aops for micropollutant abatement in drinking water treatment and potable water reuse 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials chemicals and materials used in this study were described in detail in text s1 in si details of the preparation of stock solutions of chlorine nh2cl and clo2 were shown in text s2 in si 2 2 uv exposure a bench scale uv irradiator consisting of four low pressure uv lamps 254 nm g15t8 10 w sankyo denki housed in a shuttered box with a collimating tube extending from the bottom fig s2 was used in the photochemical experiments at the uv wavelength of 254 nm quasi collimated uv light emitting diode uv led devices aquisense technologies were used in photochemical experiments at the uv wavelength of 285 or 300 nm fig s3 the two wavelengths were chosen because the uv leds at the two wavelengths are with relatively high energy efficiency yin et al 2018aa and both chlorine and clo2 have relatively high absorption coefficients at the two wavelengths fig s4 the emission spectra of the uv leds are shown in fig s5 the average incident fluence rates e0 in the reactor table s2 were measured by the iodide iodate chemical actinometry bolton and linden 2003 rahn 1997 details about incident fluence rate measurement was described in text s3 2 3 experimental procedures a buffered solution of 20 ml was spiked with one of the oxidant stock solutions chlorine nh2cl and clo2 to give an initial oxidant concentration of 70 µm the oxidant dosage level of 70 µm 5 mg l 1 as cl2 was used because it is practical or close to the real operational condition see detailed justification in text s4 the solution was buffered at ph 6 0 and 7 5 using 5 mm phosphate buffer and at ph 9 0 using 5 mm borate buffer 5 μm of nitrobenzene nb benzoic acid ba and 1 4 dimethoxybenzene dmob were added into the reacting solution as probe compounds and their degradation rate constants were used to determine the concentrations of radicals generated from uv photolysis of chlorine nh2cl or clo2 see details of this method in text s5 in si the mixed solution was then exposed to uv light at one of the three uv wavelengths 254 nm 285 nm and 300 nm each time the reactor with a diameter and a height of 60 mm and 16 mm respectively as shown in fig s2 was covered by a quartz sheet to prevent evaporation of chemicals during uv irradiation as the water depth is 0 71 cm fig s2 and the uvt values at corresponding wavelengths are all higher than 90 in this study the photodecay of oxidants was considered to be independent of the depth of the water layer hofman caris et al 2015 samples were collected at pre determined time intervals quenched with freshly prepared sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 at a na2s2o3 to chlorine molar ratio of 1 5 1 and analysed for the residual concentrations of the probe compounds the uv incident time 900 sec might be higher than that in the real practice e g a few sec because it would be very challenging to finish these steps within a very short period time if a high intensity fluence rate uv lamp was used and significant errors might be involved by doing so to determine the concentrations of ozone generated from uv photolysis of chlorine nh2cl or clo2 experiments were conducted in a similar manner except that cinnamic acid was added as the probe compound instead of adding nb ba and dmob see details of this method in text s6 in si forsyth et al 2013 to evaluate the concentrations of inorganic and organic byproducts formed in the three aops experiments were conducted in a similar manner in the absence of probe compounds with adding 1 0 mgc l 1 of suwannee river natural organic matter srnom isolate into the solution samples were collected after 15 min exposure to uv radiation quenched and analysed for the concentrations of inorganic and organic byproducts see details of quenching and sample pre treatment methods in text s7 in si details of the analytical methods for determining the concentrations of oxidants probe compounds and inorganic and organic byproducts are shown in text s8 in si apha awwa wef 2005 all experiments were conducted in duplicate the data were expressed as mean standard deviation of the two duplicate experiments statistical significance p 0 05 was evaluated by one way analysis of variance anova on origin 8 0 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of radical and ozone generation in the three aops 3 1 1 generation of radicals and ozone under the baseline conditions the concentrations of ho cl clo and ozone hereafter referred to as ho ss cl ss clo ss and o3 generated in the uv chlorine uv nh2cl and uv clo2 aops under the baseline conditions oxidant 0 70 µm ph 7 5 uv wavelength 254 nm and uv fluence 306 9 mj cm 2 were determined and compared cl2 was not considered due to its relatively low reactivity towards the probe compounds or micropollutants see detailed explanation in text s9 in si the determined concentrations of radicals and ozone in the three aops are listed in table 1 under the baseline conditions ho ss in the uv chlorine aop was 1 20 and 4 25 times higher than that in the uv nh2cl and uv clo2 aops respectively table 1 p 0 05 cl ss in the uv chlorine aop was 1 16 and 5 79 times higher than that in the uv nh2cl and uv clo2 aops respectively table 1 p 0 05 it should be emphasized that the differences in ho ss and cl ss were still within one order of magnitude therefore the differences in degradation of micropollutants reactive only towards ho and cl are expected to be marginal in the three aops on the other hand clo ss in the uv chlorine aop was much higher 2 orders of magnitudes than the other two aops table 1 therefore the uv chlorine aop would be much more efficient in degrading micropollutants that are highly reactive towards clo e g bezafibrate gemfibrozil and erythromycin guo et al 2018 o3 followed the order of uv clo2 uv chlorine p 0 05 ozone was generated in the uv clo2 aop at a level of 10 7 m which was 6 0 times higher than that in the uv chlorine aop table 1 meanwhile a negligible amount of ozone lower than the detection limit of 5 0 10 9 m was generated in the uv nh2cl aop table 1 ozone was formed from the reaction between dissolved oxygen o2 and the ground state oxygen atom o 3p eq s5 in table s1 bulman et al 2019 the o 3p can be generated from uv photolysis of hypochlorite eq s3 in table s1 or clo2 eq s20 in table s1 but not from nh2cl li and blatchley 2009 this explained why ozone was generated in the uv clo2 and uv chlorine aops but not in the uv nh2cl aop the results suggested that the uv clo2 aop might be more efficient in degrading micropollutants that are highly reactive towards ozone e g 17α ethynylestradiol 17β estradiol and roxithromycin compared to the other two aops huber et al 2003 mathon et al 2021 3 1 2 effect of ph the effect of ph on the radical and ozone concentrations in the three aops were examined and compared oxidant 0 70 µm ph 6 0 7 5 or 9 0 uv wavelength 254 nm and uv fluence 306 9 mj cm 2 at ph 6 0 ho ss cl ss and clo ss in the three aops all followed the general order of uv chlorine uv nh2cl uv clo2 p 0 05 while o3 followed the order of uv clo2 uv chlorine p 0 05 fig 1 and table s3 with increasing ph from 6 0 to 7 5 ho ss cl ss and o3 decreased and clo ss increased in the uv chlorine aop fig s6 p 0 05 while the radical and ozone concentrations in the uv nh2cl and uv clo2 aops were barely changed fig s6 p 0 05 therefore although the ho ss cl ss and clo ss in the three aops still followed the general order of uv chlorine uv nh2cl uv clo2 p 0 05 the difference in ho ss and cl ss between the uv chlorine and the other two aops became smaller while the difference in clo ss became larger o3 still followed the order of uv clo2 uv chlorine p 0 05 fig 1 but the differences between the uv clo2 and the uv chlorine aop became larger further increasing the ph to 9 0 ho ss cl ss and o3 further decreased and clo ss further increased in the uv chlorine aop fig s6 p 0 05 while the radical and ozone concentrations in the uv nh2cl and uv clo2 aops remained unchanged fig s6 p 0 05 consequently the order of ho ss and cl ss changed to uv nh2cl uv chlorine uv clo2 at ph 9 0 ho ss in the uv nh2cl aop 4 62 10 14 m was 1 44 times and 3 42 times higher than that in the uv chlorine 3 21 10 14 m and uv clo2 1 35 10 14 m aops respectively table s3 cl ss in the uv nh2cl aop 7 12 10 15 m was 4 24 times and 5 79 times higher than that in the uv chlorine 1 68 10 15 m and uv clo2 1 23 10 15 m aops respectively table s3 the uv nh2cl aop might perform slightly better than the other two aops for the degradation of micropollutants that are only reactive towards ho ss or cl ss under such conditions while the difference in degradation might be small since the difference in ho ss and cl ss was within one order of magnitude the order of clo ss remained unchanged uv chlorine uv nh2cl uv clo2 but the difference in clo ss became even larger between the uv chlorine and the other two aops fig 1 o3 still followed the order of uv clo2 uv chlorine uv nh2cl fig 1 but the differences between the uv clo2 and the other two aops became even larger in the uv chlorine aop ho ss and cl ss decreased with increasing ph from 6 0 to 9 0 which was mainly attributed to 1 the shift of hocl to ocl with increasing ph pka of hocl is 7 53 and 2 the stronger scavenging effect of ocl than hocl towards ho and cl table s4 chuang et al 2017 o3 in the uv chlorine aop also decreased with increasing ph which was mainly because of the enhanced scavenging effect of ocl on o 3p k o 3 p c l o 9 40 109 m 1 s 1 with increasing ph remucal and manley 2016 in contrast clo ss increased with increasing ph likely because ho and cl were transformed to clo via ocl scavenging eqs s7 and s8 in table s1 the insignificant impact of ph on the radical and ozone concentrations in the uv nh2cl and uv clo2 aops was mainly because nh2cl and clo2 were stable in solution at ph ranging from 6 0 to 9 0 this was supported by the supplementary test results that 5 0 of the nh2cl and clo2 were decayed under the experimental conditions see details in text s10 in si the results suggested that the differences in the degradation of micropollutants that are reactive only towards ho and cl might be marginal within one order of magnitude in the three aops at different phs while the advantage of uv chlorine aop in degrading micropollutants that are highly reactive towards clo became more significant under alkaline conditions the uv clo2 aop may outcompete the uv chlorine aop in degrading micropollutants that are highly reactive towards ozone at different phs the effects of nom bicarbonate and buffers phosphate and borate on the reactive species concentrations in the three aops were also investigated and discussed in text s11 3 1 3 effect of uv wavelength as mentioned in the introduction uv photolysis of chlorine nh2cl and clo2 are all wavelength dependent flesch et al 1999 yin et al 2018aa yin et al 2020 however the comparison of the uv chlorine uv nh2cl and uv clo2 aops at the uv wavelength other than 254 nm remains unaddressed meanwhile new monochromatic uv radiation sources e g uv leds emitting uv light at different wavelengths have emerged as promising alternatives to the conventional mercury based uv lamps chen et al 2017 song et al 2016 therefore the effect of uv wavelength on radical and ozone concentrations in the three aops was evaluated and compared oxidant 0 70 µm ph 7 5 uv wavelength 254 285 or 300 nm the radical and ozone concentrations determined at different uv wavelengths were normalized by uv fluences and the results are shown in fig 2 at a uv irradiation wavelength of 254 nm the radical concentrations in the three aops followed the order of uv chlorine uv nh2cl uv clo2 at uv irradiation wavelengths of 285 nm and 300 nm the radical concentrations followed a different order of uv chlorine uv clo2 uv nh2cl and the differences between the uv chlorine and uv clo2 aops became smaller the ozone concentration in the uv clo2 aop was 6 0 and 1 5 times higher than that in the uv chlorine aop at 254 and 285 nm respectively and it was comparable to that in the uv chlorine aop at 300 nm the different trends of radical concentrations in the three aops at different uv wavelengths were attributed to the different wavelength dependencies of chlorine nh2cl and clo2 as shown in fig s7 the concentrations of radicals ho cl and clo and ozone in the uv chlorine and uv clo2 aops all increased with increasing uv wavelength from 254 to 300 nm p 0 05 in contrast the concentrations of radicals ho cl and clo in the uv nh2cl aop decreased with increasing wavelength from 254 to 300 nm p 0 05 note ozone was not generated in the uv nh2cl aop so it was not discussed consistent with previous findings yin et al 2018a yin et al 2020 the wavelength dependencies on reactive species generation were well supported by the wavelength dependencies on the molar absorption coefficients of chlorine nh2cl and clo2 fig s4 which followed the same trends as the uv wavelength increased from 254 to 300 nm the results suggested that the uv radiation sources at longer uv wavelengths 254 300 nm are promising alternatives to the low pressure uv lamp in driving the uv chlorine and uv clo2 aops the uv clo2 aop can be more efficient than the uv nh2cl aop in generating reactive species at a longer uv wavelength e g 300 nm while it can hardly outcompete the uv chlorine aop 3 2 prediction and comparison of micropollutant degradation in the three aops as many micropollutants are reactive towards the reactive species though to different extents among different micropollutants and different reactive species their degradation rate constants contributed by the reactive species k m p p r e d i c t e d can be calculated and predicted by multiplying the concentrations of the reactive species that were determined in this study with the second order rate constants of the micropollutants towards the reactive species ho cl clo and ozone that were collected from the literature table s5 see detailed calculation methods in text s12 the contribution of the oxidant precursors chlorine nh2cl and clo2 on the micropollutant degradation can also be predicted by multiplying the initial concentrations of the oxidant precursors with the second order rate constants of the micropollutants towards the oxidant precursors table s5 k m p p r e d i c t e d of 24 micropollutants in the three aops are shown in fig 3 based on the predominant contributor s to the degradation the 24 micropollutants were categorized into three groups groups ⅰ ii and iii all the micropollutants exhibit high reactivities towards the radicals ho cl and clo k m p r a d i c a l 106 1010 m 1 s 1 table s5 gan et al 2020 mathon et al 2021 the categorization was thus made based on whether the micropollutants are reactive towards ozone and or the oxidant precursors chlorine nh2cl and clo2 for example micropollutants that exhibit high reactivities towards ozone k m p o z o n e 105 m 1 s 1 and or the oxidant precursors chlorine nh2cl and clo2 k m p o x i d a n t 50 m 1 s 1 are categorized into group i including sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim carbamazepine diclofenac 17β estradiol estrone 17α ethynylestradiol phenol roxithromycin naproxen gemfibrozil and ofloxacin these micropollutants contain electron rich and ozone reactive moieties such as phenol aniline amine and ether oxide groups r1 o r2 mathon et al 2021 muñoz and von sonntag 2000 for those micropollutants the k m p p r e d i c t e d followed the general order of uv clo2 uv chlorine uv nh2cl the only one exception case in group i was ofloxacin the degradation of which followed the order of uv chlorine uv clo2 uv nh2cl this was due to the much higher 80 times reactivity of ofloxacin towards chlorine than clo2 table s5 micropollutants that exhibit moderate reactivity towards ozone k m p o z o n e 103 m 1 s 1 and or the oxidant precursors k m p o x i d a n t 1 0 m 1 s 1 are categorized into group ii including metoprolol erythromycin and atenolol these micropollutants are secondary amines or compounds containing ketone groups which are known to be less reactive towards ozone mathon et al 2021 sharma 2008 the k m p p r e d i c t e d of the micropollutants in group ii followed the order of uv chlorine uv clo2 uv nh2cl micropollutants that exhibit low reactivity towards ozone k m p o z o n e 103 m 1 s 1 and or the oxidant precursors k m p o x i d a n t 1 0 m 1 s 1 are categorized into group iii including theophylline caffeine atrazine metronidazole bezafibrate clofibric acid ibuprofen iopromide and primidone these micropollutants are carboxylic acids amides or compounds containing derivatives of n c n bonds which are known to be refractory to the oxidation by ozone chlorine nh2cl or clo2 mathon et al 2021 the k m p p r e d i c t e d of the micropollutants in group iii followed the order of uv chlorine uv nh2cl uv clo2 to validate the predicted degradation rate constants two micropollutants phenol and ibuprofen were selected and their degradation rate constants were determined via experiments and compared with the predicted ones fig s8 as shown in fig 3 and fig s8 the values obtained from the experiments and the prediction were comparable with differences k e x p k m p p r e d i c t e d k m p p r e d i c t e d smaller than 20 the results suggested that the prediction was well validated against the experimental results and the degradation rate constants of other micropollutants can be predicted by using the method established in this study the above results clearly demonstrated the limitations of comparing different aops by just comparing the degradation rate constants of a specific micropollutant s because such comparison is bias towards a specific aop due to the specific reactivity of the tested micropollutant s towards specific reactive species and or oxidants instead by using the method established in this study the degradation efficiencies of different micropollutants contributed by the reactive species ho cl clo and ozone and the oxidant precursors chlorine nh2cl and clo2 in the three aops can be predicted and compared as long as the second order rate constants of the micropollutants towards the reactive species and oxidant precursors are available 3 3 comparison of byproduct formation and toxicity in the three aops 3 3 1 formation of inorganic byproducts and the associated toxicity formation of undesired byproducts is one of the major concerns of aops in real water treatment practices it is known that some inorganic and organic byproducts can be formed from uv photolysis of chlorine nh2cl and clo2 kong et al 2021 li and blatchley 2009 sun et al 2016 the formation of inorganic byproducts including chlorite clo2 chlorate clo3 nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 in the three aops were examined in the presence of 1 0 mg c l 1 of srnom under the baseline conditions oxidant 0 70 µm ph 7 5 uv wavelength 254 nm and uv fluence 306 9 mj cm 2 clo2 0 20 mg l 1 as clo2 was formed in the uv clo2 aop but it was undetectable lower than the detection limit of 0 015 mg l 1 as clo2 in the uv chlorine and uv nh2cl aops table s6 the molar yield of clo2 in the uv clo2 aop was calculated to be 14 9 the clo2 formation was mainly attributed to the reaction between clo2 and srnom through the one electron transfer pathway gan et al 2019 the concentrations of clo3 formed in the uv chlorine aop 0 10 mg l 1 as clo3 was 44 lower than that in the uv clo2 aop 0 18 mg l 1 as clo3 noted that the background clo3 in the chlorine and clo2 stock solutions was considered and deducted in the calculation table s6 a negligible amount of clo3 lower than the detection limit of 0 015 mg l 1 as clo3 was formed in the uv nh2cl aop in the uv chlorine aop clo3 can only be formed from clo2 oxidation by chlorine and the reactive species cheng et al 2019 remucal and manley 2016b however the formation of clo2 in the uv chlorine aop was very limited and it was below the detection limit 0 015 mg l 1 as clo2 as discussed above in contrast in the uv clo2 aop the reaction between srnom and clo2 could directly generate clo3 molar yield 10 and clo2 molar yield 40 70 gan et al 2019 and clo2 could be further oxidized by the reactive species and or clo2 to form clo3 bulman et al 2019 zuo et al 1997 those explained why the uv chlorine aop formed a lower concentration of clo3 than the uv clo2 aop under the comparable experimental conditions although insignificant amount of clo2 and clo3 was formed in the uv nh2cl aop no2 0 11 mg l 1 as no2 and no3 0 13 mg l 1 as no3 were formed as the byproducts the molar yields of no2 and no3 were calculated to be 17 4 and 15 3 respectively the formation pathways of no2 and no3 during uv photolysis of nh2cl at ph 7 5 in the absence of nom were reported by li and blatchley 2009 with a yield of 44 4 and 9 7 for no2 and no3 respectively the higher yield of no3 in this study might be attributed to the direct formation of no3 from the reactions between nh2cl and srnom vikesland et al 1998 as a radical scavenger no2 generated in the uv nh2cl aop was one of the reasons for the lower concentrations of reactive species in the uv nh2cl aop than those in the uv chlorine aop hofman caris et al 2015 yin et al 2020 although no3 can be photolyzed and generate radicals its effect was negligible considering the low concentration of no3 0 13 mg l 1 as no3 the inorganic byproduct associated additive toxicity was calculated using a toxicity potency weighting method details provided in text s13 in si chuang and mitch 2017 cuthbertson et al 2019 zeng et al 2016 as shown in fig 4 a the inorganic byproduct associated additive toxicity in the three aops followed the order of uv clo2 uv chlorine uv nh2cl the higher inorganic byproduct associated additive toxicity in the uv clo2 aop than that in the uv chlorine aop was consistent with the higher concentrations of clo2 and clo3 formed in the former aop table s6 the much lower inorganic byproduct associated additive toxicity in the uv nh2cl aop compared to the other two aops was attributed to the much lower toxic potencies of no2 no3 than clo2 clo3 table s7 3 3 2 formation of organic byproducts and the associated toxicity the concentrations of organic byproducts formed in the three aops in the presence of 1 0 mg c l 1 of srnom were determined and compared under the baseline conditions oxidant 0 70 µm ph 7 5 uv wavelength 254 nm and uv fluence 306 9 mj cm 2 as shown in fig 4b the concentrations of total organic chlorine tocl formed in the three aops followed the order of uv chlorine uv nh2cl uv clo2 the concentrations of tocl generated from srnom in the uv chlorine 137 6 µg l 1 and uv clo2 31 5 µg l 1 aops were at the same level as the values reported previously under the similar experimental conditions 100 300 µg l 1 in the uv chlorine aop and 30 µg l 1 in the uv clo2 aop kong et al 2021 ruan et al 2021 comparison regarding the concentration of tocl generated from srnom in the uv nh2cl aop was not conducted because the corresponding value was not available in the literature moreover oxidant precursors chlorine nh2cl and clo2 were the main contributors to the tocl formation fig 4b because compared to the cases without uv irradiation the uv chlorine aops only enhanced the tocl formation by 24 1 and the enhancement was insignificant in the other two aops p 0 05 fig 4b the larger enhancement in the uv chlorine aop was consistent with the higher generation of radicals ho cl and clo than the other two aops considering that the radicals ho cl and clo have been reported to enhance the chloro organic byproduct formation from nom lei et al 2021 yeom et al 2021 the concentration of tobr was negligible 1 2 µg l 1 as cl in all treated samples due to the absence of inorganic and organic bromine e g bromide and bromine containing organics in the simulated solution containing 70 µm of oxidants 1 mgc l 1 of srnom and 5 mm of phosphate buffer however in the presence of 0 5 mg l 1 of bromide ion br the concentrations of tox in the uv chlorine and uv clo2 aops were found to be comparable p 0 05 and were much higher than that in the uv nh2cl aop see details in text s14 and fig s9 besides tocl and tobr seven selected chloro organic byproducts including trichloropropanone tcp dichloropropanone dcp dichloroacetonitrile dcan chloral hydrate ch trichloromethane tcm trichloroacetic acid tcaa and dichloroacetic acid dcaa were determined in the three aops fig 4c the summed concentrations of the seven chloro organic byproducts were also at the same level as the value reported previously under the similar experimental conditions kong et al 2021 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 and followed the similar order as tocl concentration uv chlorine uv nh2cl uv clo2 the formation of organic byproducts from the three aops with post oxidation for 24 h were also found to follow the same order uv chlorine uv nh2cl uv clo2 text s15 and fig s10 the toxic potency weighted byproduct concentrations of the seven selected chloro organic byproducts were calculated and the results are shown in fig 4d the organic byproduct associated additive toxicity in the three aops followed the order of uv chlorine uv nh2cl uv clo2 p 0 05 the order was consistent with the tocl concentration and the summed concentrations of the seven selected chloro organic byproducts fig 4c as shown in fig 4d despite the predominance of tcm and dcaa with respect to the mass concentrations in the three aops their contributions to the overall toxicity were much lower on the contrary dcan and ch had dominant contributions to the organic byproduct associated additive toxicity in the three aops transformation products of certain micropollutants may also contribute the toxicity of the treated water aghdam et al 2017 yang et al 2021 while nom contributed more than the transformation products of micropollutants to the toxicity of the treated water see details in text s16 the results demonstrated that although the uv chlorine aop generated higher concentrations of radicals ho cl and clo than the uv nh2cl and uv clo2 aops it also formed higher concentrations of chloro organic byproducts and had higher organic byproduct associated toxicity the intrinsic trade off between radical generation and byproduct formation or toxicity was clearly demonstrated the results also demonstrated that although the uv clo2 aop showed the lowest organic byproduct associated additive toxicity it showed the highest inorganic byproduct associated additive toxicity it should be noted that the inorganic and organic byproduct associated additive toxicities were not summed up in this study because they were reported to show a synergistic relationship rather than the additive relationship though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear han and zhang 2018 the evaluation on the overall toxicity in the three aops by incorporating both organic and inorganic byproduct associated toxicities is recommended for future investigation 4 conclusions this study demonstrated the bright and dark sides of uv photolysis of three chlorine based disinfectants chlorine nh2cl and clo2 by conducting a comparative study with respect to the reactive species generation micropollutant degradation byproduct formation and toxicity change in the uv chlorine uv nh2cl and uv clo2 aops under several environmentally relevant conditions a few practical implications can be drawn from the findings of this study 1 there is no best uv aop there is an intrinsic trade off between radical generation and byproduct formation or toxicity the uv chlorine aop is more efficient in degrading micropollutants that are highly reactive towards radicals ho cl and clo but it is more sensitive to ph of the water and forms higher concentrations of chloro organic byproducts and poses higher organic byproduct associated toxicity the uv clo2 aop is more efficient in degrading micropollutants that are highly reactive towards ozone but it forms higher concentrations of clo2 and clo3 and poses higher inorganic byproduct associated toxicity 2 the reactive species concentrations in the uv clo2 and uv chlorine aops increased with increasing uv wavelength from 254 nm to 300 nm uv leds at longer uv wavelengths e g uvb a ranges are recommended to drive the two aops with consideration of the relatively higher wall plug efficiency and lower cost of uvb a leds compared to the uvc leds kebbi et al 2020 and their mercury free feature 3 although the uv nh2cl aop generates lower concentrations of ho cl and clo than the uv chlorine aop the reactive nitrogen species rns nh2 no and no2 are reported to be generated and contribute to micropollutant degradation wu et al 2019 technological advancements are needed to quantify the concentrations of rns and their contributions to micropollutant degradation byproduct
