3590,high atmospheric dry and wet deposition of dissolved organic carbon doc may contribute to net ecosystem carbon balance necb but the input and output fluxes of doc and their transport processes in a catchment remain unclear here to elucidate the importance of doc in necb from the view of earth s critical zone we measured the water fluxes of inputs precipitation throughfall and stemflow and outputs soil leachate surface flow interflow streamflow and groundwater and their doc concentrations in a subtropical plantation headwater catchment our results showed that dry doc deposition from plant derived dust and exudates 22 317 kg c km 2 yr 1 was about 4 5 times higher than the wet doc deposition from precipitation 4966 kg c km 2 yr 1 and accounted for 3 88 and 0 86 of the net ecosystem c productivity nep 5 75 105 kg c km 2 yr 1 respectively in comparison doc fluxes in stream and groundwater were 5912 and 3905 kg c km 2 yr 1 indicating that soil buffered doc flux was 17 466 kg c km 2 yr 1 and accounted for 3 04 of nep a positive correlation between doc and ph and total dissolved solids in soil leachate indicated that the biophysical and chemical absorption bridged the interaction between soil minerals and organic carbon our results underline the importance of including plant derived doc deposition in carbon sink estimations in subtropical plantation headwater catchments

export in a headwater stream in a pristine boreal fen in sweden accounted for 50 of necb while dissolved organic carbon doc accounted for 70 of the total aquatic carbon campeau et al 2017 doc is a highly mobile and reactive carbon pool present in plant canopy stream and in groundwater leachate fig 1 it is also an important link between labile and stable soil organic carbon kindler et al 2011 toosi et al 2012 high biodegradability of riverine doc resulted in subsequently releasing co2 to the atmosphere potentially intensifying global warming liu and wang 2021 mann et al 2015 vonk et al 2015 a complete understanding of doc fluxes and their transport processes at a headwater catchment scale requires an earth s critical zone approach from plant canopy down to streamflow and groundwater richter and billings 2015 li et al 2017 generally precipitation and vegetation regulate doc inputs in headwater catchments and influence organic carbon budgets from regional to global scales campeau et al 2017 chen et al 2017 marx et al 2017 yet most studies have focused on canopy interception effect studies on estimating the fluxes of plant derived doc and its contribution to necb is lacked chen et al 2017 precipitation not only contributes doc directly by atmospheric wet deposition but also collects plant derived doc including accumulated plant exudates and dry deposition from vegetation canopy and stem chiwa et al 2004 levia et al 2011 the process of throughfall and stemflow can remove doc from canopies and stems in forest ecosystems staelens et al 2006a staelens et al 2006b levia et al 2011 for example chen et al 2017 found that doc fluxes in bulk precipitation throughfall and stemflow were critically important to soil carbon sequestration in a cold temperate broadleaf deciduous forest in central japan and should be accounted for in carbon balance of forest ecosystems plant derived doc contains abundant organic acids and shows higher bioavailability in throughfall and stemflow than doc in precipitation and stream waters howard et al 2018 previous studies have found canopy exchange of base cations and dissolution of weak organic acids lead to acid neutralizing capacity of throughfall and stemflow tan et al 2018 sun et al 2021 however in the context of high atmospheric acid deposition zhang et al 2022 the connection between doc concentration and ph in throughfall and stemflow is still unclear the dynamics of doc in soil organic layer to deep subsoil regulate doc balance in headwater catchments by buffering exogenous carbon input and soil organic carbon soc leaching kindler et al 2011 li et al 2017 composition and characteristics of doc vary in streamflow and groundwater surface flow and interflow and in soil solutions from topsoil to deep soil kindler et al 2011 li et al 2018 song et al 2019 the doc composition was considered as the primary driver influencing doc biodegradability in small streams liu and wang 2021 accompanied by a leaching process plant derived compounds hydrophilic fraction aromatic carbon and lignin phenols decrease with soil depth while microbial compounds increase in abundance kaiser and kalbitz 2012 majority about 70 of doc leached from residue amended 13c ryegrass residue addition soils originated from native soc toosi et al 2012 using 14c labeled doc tracking hagedorn et al 2015 found that most 80 on average of litter doc was retained in soils aboveground doc leaching into soil as discrete pulses during precipitation events serves as an efficient way to offset soil organic carbon loss sokol and bradford 2019 however the study on quantitative estimation of soil buffered doc during leaching process is few in headwater catchments doc transport through the soil profile is controlled by a series of sorption and desorption processes and microbial processing kaiser and kalbitz 2012 cotrufo et al 2015 roth et al 2019 molecular changes in doc during its passage through soils include a dynamic exchange between plant derived doc and mineral stabilized soil organic carbon kaiser and kalbitz 2012 roth et al 2019 minerals stabilize organic carbon mainly in four ways complexation reactions ligand exchange interaction cation bridges hydrophobic effects and van der waals forces arnarson and keil 2000 barré et al 2014 therefore the factors including ph oxidation reduction potential orp ionic strength that affect interactions between minerals and organic carbon also affect doc transport in soil and even in headwater streams hagedorn et al 2012 musolff et al 2017 kopáček et al 2018 sanclements et al 2018 musolff et al 2017 showed that the release of organic carbon in streams was linked to declining nitrogen deposition because low nitrate led to iron iii reduction and thus fe oc disintegration sanclements et al 2018 supposed that decreased sulfur deposition led to increasing ph and decreasing ionic strength which would further increase solubility of soc and increase doc flux to streams kopáček et al 2018 showed that n cycling strongly influenced doc leaching and mechanisms of doc leaching related to ph and orp varied over periods 1997 2017 following a disturbance in an unmanaged european mountain forest in addition changes in ph and orp may affect extracellular enzyme activities and microbial composition fierer 2017 kang et al 2018 higher ph promoted phenol oxidase activities and enhanced doc concentration in pore water kang et al 2018 the dominant mechanism varies with environmental factors and is still controversial in headwater stream systems kalbitz et al 2017 this limits the estimation of aquatic doc flux in headwater catchments barré et al 2014 nep in subtropical forests in china is comparable to that of southeastern united states and western european forests in the 1980s to 2010s and therefore serves as an important carbon sink of terrestrial ecosystems yu et al 2014 he et al 2019 however lateral doc fluxes remain unclear and lead to great uncertainty to necb of terrestrial ecosystems gao and yu 2020 in subtropical area in china seasonal high precipitation leads to substantial doc deposition and soil leaching in addition the zonal red soil in subtropical area in china accumulates abundant iron and aluminum oxides which have strong adsorption to doc ying et al 2013 sun et al 2015 therefore the plant derived and soil buffered doc limits the comprehensive understanding of necb in a subtropical plantation headwater catchment in consideration of uncertain doc inputs and outputs of headwater catchments and their contributions to necb the fluxes of plant derived and soil buffered doc and the underlying mechanisms need a comprehensive assessment here we measured doc fluxes and dominant hydrochemistry in precipitation throughfall stemflow soil solution surface flow interflow streamflow and groundwater in a headwater catchment in a subtropical forest plantation in southwestern china our objectives were to quantify doc input fluxes from atmospheric wet and plant derived deposition and doc export fluxes with streamflow and groundwater and clarify the role of plant derived and soil buffered doc fluxes in necb and clarify the underlying mechanisms of variation in these fluxes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this study was conducted in xiangxi catchment a headwater stream catchment located in

precipitation streamflow and groundwater measurement streamflow in xiangxi stream was measured from january 2019 to december 2020 in a downstream location in a triangular weir every 10 min using a cs451 submersible pressure transducer campbell scientific inc usa and a dl1000w datalogger beijing truwel instruments inc china song et al 2021 stream water samples were collected upstream midstream and downstream at least twice a month during rainy seasons march to august and once a month during dry seasons september to february of the following year during october to december of 2019 a prolonged drought caused the stream to dry up and no samples were collected differences in doc concentration in all components were examined with a one way analysis of variance anova precipitation was measured every hour with a maws301 automatic meteorological station vaisala finland bulk precipitation samples were taken manually after precipitation events using a rain gauge groundwater samples were taken from 3 wells from upstream to downstream twice a month as a total 56 rounds of samples in stream and groundwater and 61 precipitation sample were collected all water samples were transported to the laboratory within an hour of collection and then refrigerated 2 2 2 throughfall stemflow and soil leachate measurement four transects were established in the headwater catchment based on vegetation types along stream to quantify forest hydrological processes in 2019 and 2020 specifically throughfall samples were collected and their volumes were measured with 9 rain barrels φ 10 cm in each transect from the top to bottom of the slope stemflow samples were collected from 20 trees of four dominant species 5 trees for each species with a range of diameter at breast height from 6 7 to 35 2 cm in this catchment soil leachate in main soil layers litter and at 10 20 40 80 and 100 cm depth were collected in three sites per transect at least once a month using zero pressure for litter layer and negative pressure ceramic sampler for soil solution below 10 cm respectively as a total 28 rounds of samples in throughfall and stemflow and 19 rounds of samples in soil leachate were collected during study period 2 2 3 surface flow and interflow leachate measurement in runoff plots three runoff plots 5 m 20 m were constructed to measure surface flow and interflow leachate fig 2 first ditches of four sides in each plot were excavated to the bedrock layer 88 136 cm and a width of 60 cm the ditches were filled with concrete 15 20 cm thickness except the downslope side to insulate the runoff plot the remaining downslope edge was first filled with concrete to 10 15 cm depth and then coated with polymer cement waterproof material to create interflow flume a permeable stratum made up of crushed granite rocks packed in nylon gauze was built above the interflow flume the upper layer of the permeable stratum was built as surface flow flume with concrete and waterproof material the surface flow flume was 10 cm lower than the soil in runoff plots two large buckets 1 0 m3 with drainage pvc hoses were used to sample total surface flow and interflow the amount of runoff was measured with water flowmeter after each precipitation event as a total 22 round of samples in surface flow and interflow were collected during study period soil moisture was monitored in four layers 10 20 40 and 100 cm in the upslope middle and downslope of the runoff plot using a soil moisture sensor and a cx 23x datalogger campbell scientific inc usa 2 2 4 doc concentrations and

electrical conductivity total dissolved solids tds and redox potential orp of precipitation throughfall stemflow soil solution stream and groundwater and surface flow and interflow leachate were determined with a portable ph meter ultrameter 6ii myron l company usa filtered samples were acidified with phosphoric acid and their total dissolved carbon dtc concentration and dic concentrations was measured using a toc analyzer vario toc cube elementar germany doc was calculated by subtracting dic from dtc iavorivska et al 2016 2 3 net carbon balance in headwater catchment annual doc balance at catchment scale was calculated with the following equation f plant f p f stream f g f soil where fplant and fp were net input doc fluxes kg c km 2 yr 1 in plant derived dust and exudates and in precipitation respectively fstream and fg were output doc fluxes in streamflow and groundwater respectively fsoil was soil buffered doc flux the net input doc fluxes in precipitation fp and plant derived exudates and dust fplant were calculated on an annual basis as follows f p c p f tf f sf p f plant f tf f sf f tf c tf c p f tf p f sf c sf c p f sf p where cp ctf and csf were weighted mean doc concentration mg l 1 based on water discharge in precipitation throughfall and stemflow respectively p was total precipitation mm yr 1 outside the forest ftf and fsf were the proportions of throughfall and stemflow accounted for total precipitation respectively ftf and fsf were doc fluxes kg c km 2 yr 1 in throughfall and stemflow respectively the output doc fluxes in streamflow fstream and groundwater fg were calculated with the loadest model runkel et al 2004 song et al 2021 f stream l o a d e s t q stream c stream f g l o a d e s t q g c g where fstream and fg were doc fluxes kg c

downstream weir qg was groundwater discharge mm calculated with the xinanjiang model song et al 2021 in addition ecosystem nep was measured with an eddy covariance system mounted on a tower at 39 6 m above ground with an open path co2 h2o analyzer li 7500 li cor inc usa and a three dimensional sonic anemometer csat3 campbell scientific inc usa flux variables were sampled at 10 hz online using a cr5000 datalogger model cr5000 campbell scientific inc usa and post 30 min mean fluxes were calculated wen et al 2006 wen et al 2010 3 results 3 1 net carbon balance and its components in a headwater catchment total annual doc flux in throughfall 25 576 kg c km 2 yr 1 and stemflow 1707 kg c km 2 yr 1 was 27 283 kg c km 2 yr 1 and export doc fluxes in streamflow and groundwater were 5912 and 3905 kg c km 2 yr 1 respectively table 1 the deficit between input and export doc fluxes buffered by soil was 17 466 kg c km 2 yr 1 for comparison soil buffered doc fluxes would be 4851 kg c km 2 yr 1 without considering doc deposition by vegetation net doc fluxes derived from precipitation subtracting canopy interception of 19 5 were 4966 kg c km 2 yr 1 the net input fluxes of plant derived doc were 22 317 kg c km 2 yr 1 in addition the nep in this subtropical catchment ecosystem was 6 38 105 in 2019 and 5 11 105 kg c km 2 yr 1 in 2020 therefore soil buffered doc served as an effective carbon sink that accounted for 3 04 of nep plant derived doc accounted for 3 88 of nep affected by the subtropical monsoon climate doc fluxes in precipitation streamflow and groundwater exhibited seasonal variability fig 3 most of the doc transport 90 from precipitation to stream and groundwater occurred in wet season march to august daily doc flux in precipitation were estimated at up to 410 kg c km 2 day 1 which accounted for 6 6 of the annual doc flux 3 2 doc concentrations from vegetation canopy to stream water and groundwater doc concentrations from vegetation canopy to stream water and groundwater showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing fig 4 doc concentration in throughfall and stemflow was significantly higher than that in precipitation p 0 01 doc concentration increased from the litter layer to topsoil at 10 cm depth and then decreased from topsoil to deep subsoil doc concentration in litter leachate was also higher than that of throughfall p 0 01 doc concentration significantly decreased from topsoil 0 10 cm to middle subsoil 10 40 cm and deep subsoil 40 100 cm p 0 01 due to differences in hydrological flow paths doc concentration in surface flow was higher than that in interflow p 0 01 while it had no significant difference with that in litter leachate p 0 55 dynamics of doc concentration in atmosphere plant soil continuum reflected doc enrichment in plants and surface soil leaching and subsoil absorption processes 3 3 dependence of plant derived doc concentrations on ph doc concentrations in stemflow and throughfall were significantly higher than those in precipitation p 0 001 doc was positively negatively and non significantly correlated with ph in throughfall r 0 41 p 0 005 stemflow r 0 66 p 0 001 and precipitation r 0 19 p 0 382 respectively fig 5 linear regression further showed the dependence of plant derived doc concentrations on ph correlations between doc and ph in stemflow and throughfall were exactly the opposite stemflow had more doc but lower ph than throughfall p 0 001 3 4 dependence of soil buffered doc on hydrochemical factors though both the litter layer and topsoil 0 10 cm acted as doc sources in doc leaching process the relationships between doc concentration and ph in litter leachate negative and topsoil solution positive were opposite table 2 fig 6 doc was also negatively correlated with ph in the middle subsoil but not correlated in deep subsoil the ph in litter leachate was significantly lower than that in all soil solutions p 0 01 doc concentrations were positively correlated with tds in litter leachate and all soil solutions p 0 01 the relationships between doc and ph and between doc and tds in surface flow were similar to those of litter leachate due to similar hydrological paths fig 6 affected by soil doc leaching and absorption processes both relationships between doc and ph and between doc and tds in interflow streamflow and groundwater were insignificant in addition orp were higher than 100 mv and had insignificant correlations with doc concentrations in all water samples table 2 4 discussion 4 1 contribution of plant derived doc to net ecosystem carbon balance 4 1 1 input fluxes from plant derived and precipitation doc total doc input fluxes from plant derived 22 317 kg c km 2 year 1 and precipitation doc 4966 kg c km 2 year 1 were 27 283 kg c km 2 year 1 table 1 plants affect doc deposition through canopy interception and leaching from plant surfaces levia et al 2011 in this study the canopy intercepted 1203 kg c km 2 year 1 of precipitation doc which was equivalent to 4 41 of the total doc input fluxes both dust deposited in the canopies and leaf exudates contribute doc in throughfall and stemflow levia et al 2011 gonzalez ollauri et al 2020 the plant derived doc in throughfall and stemflow dominated 81 8 of total doc input fluxes as the highest doc concentration but minimum water volume 2 3 of precipitation stemflow accounted for 7 02 of plant derived doc fluxes however stemflow together with root induced preferential flow formed a unique double funneling channel gonzalez ollauri et al 2020 through which the highly concentrated and bioavailable doc infiltrated the soil around plant roots most likely affecting the activity of rhizosphere microorganisms and nutrient absorption by plant roots van der putten et al 2013 sokol and bradford 2019 bulk precipitation doc flux 6169 kg c km 2 year 1 in the headwater catchment in this study was in the high range compared to global mean fluxes 3400 3300 kg c km 2 year 1 iavorivska et al 2016 first precipitation in this subtropical area was higher 1438 mm year 1 than the global mean due to the subtropical monsoon climate second precipitation doc concentration at our site 4 29 mg l 1 was also higher than the global mean 2 64 1 9 mg l 1 iavorivska et al 2016 possible sources of doc in precipitation were fuel and biomass burning biogenic aerosols and volatile organic carbon voc coelho et al 2008 pantelaki et al 2018 voc emissions from forests pinus fir picea quercus and so on might be primary source of vocs in precipitation klinger et al 2002 yu et al 2017 our headwater catchment had a high vocs emission 2 68 g c m 2 yr 1 which was higher than the mean concentration in china 1 35 g c m 2 yr 1 and europe 0 51 g c m 2 yr 1 simpson et al 1999 klinger et al 2002 dissolution of land surface vocs may contribute to high doc concentration in precipitation in our site 4 1 2 plant derived doc regulated by dust and exudates dry dust and leaf exudates leached with throughfall while organic matter formed by the degradation of the tree outer bark was washed by stemflow differences in sources and residence time led to the different characteristics of doc in throughfall and stemflow levia et al 2011 chen et al 2017 degradation of slash pine masson pine and fir bark would release acidic organic compounds and simultaneously increase the doc content and reduce ph of stemflow keiluweit et al 2015 the negative relationship between doc and ph in stemflow at our site table 2 indicated a contribution by the dissolution of plant derived acid organic compounds additionally differences in ph between throughfall and precipitation indicated the canopy s buffering effect on precipitation ph howard et al 2018 during canopy leaching ion exchange between precipitation and canopy may contribute to the buffering of throughfall ph levia et al 2011 the longer contact time between stemflow and tree trunk than that between precipitation and canopy is beneficial to organic acid dissolution fröberg et al 2007 bioavailability and solubility of doc in canopy leachate stemflow and litter leachate is generally higher than that of doc in soil kopáček et al 2017 howard et al 2018 kopáček et al 2018 in an indoor culture experiment 36 73 of the doc in throughfall was mineralized within 4 days howard et al 2018 plant derived macromolecular organic matter is first degraded to small molecule organic matter roth et al 2019 sokol and bradford 2019 after infiltrating into the soil plant derived small molecule organic matter rapidly decreased while soil derived macromolecular organic matter increased with soil depth kaiser and kalbitz 2012 scott and rothstein 2014 this indicates that plant derived organic carbon is preferentially decomposed by microorganisms and transformed into macromolecular microbial organic carbon which is then complexed with soil minerals for protection against further decomposition roth et al 2019 4 2 contribution of soil buffered doc to net ecosystem carbon balance 4 2 1 soil buffered doc as a carbon sink soil served as a carbon sink by immobilizing doc 17466 kg c km 2 yr 1 namely 3 04 of nep in this subtropical plantation headwater catchment table 1 the dynamics of doc leaching from litter and topsoil and doc absorption in subsoil 10 cm regulated the deficit between aboveground doc input and total output fluxes chen et al 2021 found that plant carbon input was the major contributor to topsoil 10 cm carbon destabilization and mineral protection by iron and aluminum oxides and cations became more important in preserving som in middle subsoil 20 cm studies also found that plant derived doc is mostly held in the surface soil while doc in deep subsoil was sourced mainly from microbial metabolites and upper soil doc leaching schwesig et al 2003 müller et al 2009 toosi et al 2012 our study found that the adsorption effect on plant derived doc of exists in whole soil profile 0 100 cm which could apparently increase soil sequestration of exogenous doc a soil column leaching study found that exogenous doc is mostly adsorbed by iron and aluminum oxides in topsoil 5 5 cm müller et al 2009 while doc in subsoil is derived from by products of extracellular enzyme decomposition and microbial assimilation toosi et al 2012 though laboratory based studies have shown that exogenous doc primes soil respiration soil immobilization of exogenous doc still serves as a short term carbon sink zhou et al 2016 kaiser and kalbitz 2012 proposed a view of cycling downwards to describe doc leaching from surface soil to deep soil during leaching process both adsorption of reactive minerals and microbial transformation buffered doc inputs and outputs generally 70 of the doc in the soil solution originated from soil sources rather than exogenous doc müller et al 2009 scott and rothstein 2014 east asian monsoon subtropical forests in china exhibited an average nep of 362 39 g c m 2 year 1 in the 1990 s and 2000 s yu et al 2014 due to the frequency of precipitation and low surface runoff coefficient about 64 of input doc was sequestered by soil at our site the soil buffered doc served as an overlooked carbon sink and accounted for about 4 82 of the average nep in subtropical forests in china 4 2 2 soil buffered doc regulated by biophysical and chemical adsorption soil buffering of doc is a systematic process which includes adsorption on reactive minerals microbial transformations and re release into the soil solution during doc leaching through the soil profile kaiser and kalbitz 2012 scott and rothstein 2014 lee et al 2018 leinemann et al 2018 doc with high aromaticity high molecular weight and low biodegradability is easily adsorbed by soil while doc with low aromaticity relatively small molecular weight and high biodegradability is more likely to be released into water bodies kaiser and kalbitz 2012 scott and rothstein 2014 main factors affecting mineral adsorption of doc include ph ionic strength and redox potential hagedorn et al 2012 musolff et al 2017 kopáček et al 2018 sanclements et al 2018 both ph and tds positively correlated with doc concentration in the soil profile in this study table 2 indicating that acidity change and ionic strength mechanisms affected solubility of organic carbon in soil sanclements et al 2012 sanclements et al 2018 studies found the hydroxyl oh groups on fe al oxides could form covalent bonds between som carboxyl and phenolic oh groups through ligand exchange that results in the direct and strong adsorption of som finley et al 2018 soc solubility increases with increasing ph as hydroxide ions decrease protonation of carboxylic functional groups neutralize positive charges and lead to more hydrophilic organic matter ekström et al 2011 sanclements et al 2018 concentration of tds in soil solution is closely related to ionic strength and reflects electrical conductivity sastre de vicente 2004 tiemeyer et al 2017 the hydrochemical characteristics tds ionic strength and electrical conductivity were based on basic cations k na ca2 mg2 etc and main anions so4 2 no3 cl co3 2 hco3 etc several studies have shown that high ionic strength reduces doc concentrations hruška et al 2009 clark et al 2011 the negatively charged mineral surfaces could adsorb the negatively charged som through polyvalent cation bridging formed by cations such as ca2 and mg2 rowley et al 2018 singh et al 2018 tiemeyer et al 2017 also found positive correlations between doc and electrical conductivity in soil solution in a field study hruška et al 2009 found that long term increases in stream water doc were correlated with only modest increases in stream ph but large declines in ionic strength in a catchment in germany the reason for these differences may be that cation concentrations may be too low to cause coagulation and bridging until an inflection point at which ionic strength begins to decrease doc concentrations under field conditions tiemeyer et al 2017 furthermore the positive correlations between doc and tds may be attributed to soil hydrologic processes the strong leaching effect in this subtropical plantation led to synchronous leaching of doc and ions high orp indicates a redox environment that limits iron reduction and fe ligand doc release barré et al 2014 however the relatively high orp 100mv in all water samples in our study indicated a constant redox environment that led to insignificant relationships between orp and doc fig 6 the high orp facilitated complexation reactions between organic carbon and soil minerals lending stability to soil organic carbon musolff et al 2017 tiemeyer et al 2017 5 conclusions the net plant derived doc flux 22 317 kg c km 2 yr 1 was about 4 5 times higher than the net doc flux in precipitation 4 966 kg c km 2 yr 1 accounting for 3 88 of nep in this headwater catchment in the subtropical forest plantation soil buffered doc served as a carbon sink for 17 466 kg c km 2 yr 1 accounting for 3 04 of nep plant derived doc contributed 81 8 of total doc input fluxes and should not be overlooked positive correlations between doc and ph in soil solutions indicated that reducing soil acidification was help to soil sequestration of plant derived doc the dynamic exchange of plant derived doc and soil buffered doc resulted in a substantial carbon sink our results stressed the importance of both wet and dry deposition of doc and the soil buffer function on doc inputs and outputs in the subtropical plantation ecosystem these doc translocation processes should be considered in future study of necb declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china 41830860 42171035

toosi et al 2012 high biodegradability of riverine doc resulted in subsequently releasing co2 to the atmosphere potentially intensifying global warming liu and wang 2021 mann et al 2015 vonk et al 2015 a complete understanding of doc fluxes and their transport processes at a headwater catchment scale requires an earth s critical zone approach from plant canopy down to streamflow and groundwater richter and billings 2015 li et al 2017 generally precipitation and vegetation regulate doc inputs in headwater catchments and influence organic carbon budgets from regional to global scales campeau et al 2017 chen et al 2017 marx et al 2017 yet most studies have focused on canopy interception effect studies on estimating the fluxes of plant derived doc and its contribution to necb is lacked chen et al 2017 precipitation not only contributes doc directly by atmospheric wet deposition but also collects plant derived doc including accumulated plant exudates and dry deposition from vegetation canopy and stem chiwa et al 2004 levia et al 2011 the process of throughfall and stemflow can remove doc from canopies and stems in forest ecosystems staelens et al 2006a staelens et al 2006b levia et al 2011 for example chen et al 2017 found that doc fluxes in bulk precipitation throughfall and stemflow were critically important to soil carbon sequestration in a cold temperate broadleaf deciduous forest in central japan and should be accounted for in carbon balance of forest ecosystems plant derived doc contains abundant organic acids and shows higher bioavailability in throughfall and stemflow than doc in precipitation and stream waters howard et al 2018 previous studies have found canopy exchange of base cations and dissolution of weak organic acids lead to acid neutralizing capacity of throughfall and stemflow tan et al 2018 sun et al 2021 however in the context of high atmospheric acid deposition zhang et al 2022 the connection between doc concentration and ph in throughfall and stemflow is still unclear the dynamics of doc in soil organic layer to deep subsoil regulate doc balance in headwater catchments by buffering exogenous carbon input and soil organic carbon soc leaching kindler et al 2011 li et al 2017 composition and characteristics of doc vary in streamflow and groundwater surface flow and interflow and in soil solutions from topsoil to deep soil kindler et al 2011 li et al 2018 song et al 2019 the doc composition was considered as the primary driver influencing doc biodegradability in small streams liu and wang 2021 accompanied by a leaching process plant derived compounds hydrophilic fraction aromatic carbon and lignin phenols decrease with soil depth while microbial compounds increase in abundance kaiser and kalbitz 2012 majority about 70 of doc leached from residue amended 13c ryegrass residue addition soils originated from native soc toosi et al 2012 using 14c labeled doc tracking hagedorn et al 2015 found that most 80 on average of litter doc was retained in soils aboveground doc leaching into soil as discrete pulses during precipitation events serves as an efficient way to offset soil organic carbon loss sokol and bradford 2019 however the study on quantitative estimation of soil buffered doc during leaching process is few in headwater catchments doc transport through the soil profile is controlled by a series of sorption and desorption processes and microbial processing kaiser and kalbitz 2012 cotrufo et al 2015 roth et al 2019 molecular changes in doc during its passage through soils include a dynamic exchange between plant derived doc and mineral stabilized soil organic carbon kaiser and kalbitz 2012 roth et al 2019 minerals stabilize organic carbon mainly in four ways complexation reactions ligand exchange interaction cation bridges hydrophobic effects and van der waals forces arnarson and keil 2000 barré et al 2014 therefore the factors including ph oxidation reduction potential orp ionic strength that affect interactions between minerals and organic carbon also affect doc transport in soil and even in headwater streams hagedorn et al 2012 musolff et al 2017 kopáček et al 2018 sanclements et al 2018 musolff et al 2017 showed that the release of organic carbon in streams was linked to declining nitrogen deposition because low nitrate led to iron iii reduction and thus fe oc disintegration sanclements et al 2018 supposed that decreased sulfur deposition led to increasing ph and decreasing ionic strength which would further increase solubility of soc and increase doc flux to streams kopáček et al 2018 showed that n cycling strongly influenced doc leaching and mechanisms of doc leaching related to ph and orp varied over periods 1997 2017 following a disturbance in an unmanaged european mountain forest in addition changes in ph and orp may affect extracellular enzyme activities and microbial composition fierer 2017 kang et al 2018 higher ph promoted phenol oxidase activities and enhanced doc concentration in pore water kang et al 2018 the dominant mechanism varies with environmental factors and is still controversial in headwater stream systems kalbitz et al 2017 this limits the estimation of aquatic doc flux in headwater catchments barré et al 2014 nep in subtropical forests in china is comparable to that of southeastern united states and western european forests in the 1980s to 2010s and therefore serves as an important carbon sink of terrestrial ecosystems yu et al 2014 he et al 2019 however lateral doc fluxes remain unclear and lead to great uncertainty to necb of terrestrial ecosystems gao and yu 2020 in subtropical area in china seasonal high precipitation leads to substantial doc deposition and soil leaching in addition the zonal red soil in subtropical area in china accumulates abundant iron and aluminum oxides which have strong adsorption to doc ying et al 2013 sun et al 2015 therefore the plant derived and soil buffered doc limits the comprehensive understanding of necb in a subtropical plantation headwater catchment in consideration of uncertain doc inputs and outputs of headwater catchments and their contributions to necb the fluxes of plant derived and soil buffered doc and the underlying mechanisms need a comprehensive assessment here we measured doc fluxes and dominant hydrochemistry in precipitation throughfall stemflow soil solution surface flow interflow streamflow and groundwater in a headwater catchment in a subtropical forest plantation in southwestern china our objectives were to quantify doc input fluxes from atmospheric wet and plant derived deposition and doc export fluxes with streamflow and groundwater and clarify the role of plant derived and soil buffered doc fluxes in necb and clarify the underlying mechanisms of variation in these fluxes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this study was conducted in xiangxi catchment a headwater stream catchment located in

precipitation streamflow and groundwater measurement streamflow in xiangxi stream was measured from january 2019 to december 2020 in a downstream location in a triangular weir every 10 min using a cs451 submersible pressure transducer campbell scientific inc usa and a dl1000w datalogger beijing truwel instruments inc china song et al 2021 stream water samples were collected upstream midstream and downstream at least twice a month during rainy seasons march to august and once a month during dry seasons september to february of the following year during october to december of 2019 a prolonged drought caused the stream to dry up and no samples were collected differences in doc concentration in all components were examined with a one way analysis of variance anova precipitation was measured every hour with a maws301 automatic meteorological station vaisala finland bulk precipitation samples were taken manually after precipitation events using a rain gauge groundwater samples were taken from 3 wells from upstream to downstream twice a month as a total 56 rounds of samples in stream and groundwater and 61 precipitation sample were collected all water samples were transported to the laboratory within an hour of collection and then refrigerated 2 2 2 throughfall stemflow and soil leachate measurement four transects were established in the headwater catchment based on vegetation types along stream to quantify forest hydrological processes in 2019 and 2020 specifically throughfall samples were collected and their volumes were measured with 9 rain barrels φ 10 cm in each transect from the top to bottom of the slope stemflow samples were collected from 20 trees of four dominant species 5 trees for each species with a range of diameter at breast height from 6 7 to 35 2 cm in this catchment soil leachate in main soil layers litter and at 10 20 40 80 and 100 cm depth were collected in three sites per transect at least once a month using zero pressure for litter layer and negative pressure ceramic sampler for soil solution below 10 cm respectively as a total 28 rounds of samples in throughfall and stemflow and 19 rounds of samples in soil leachate were collected during study period 2 2 3 surface flow and interflow leachate measurement in runoff plots three runoff plots 5 m 20 m were constructed to measure surface flow and interflow leachate fig 2 first ditches of four sides in each plot were excavated to the bedrock layer 88 136 cm and a width of 60 cm the ditches were filled with concrete 15 20 cm thickness except the downslope side to insulate the runoff plot the remaining downslope edge was first filled with concrete to 10 15 cm depth and then coated with polymer cement waterproof material to create interflow flume a permeable stratum made up of crushed granite rocks packed in nylon gauze was built above the interflow flume the upper layer of the permeable stratum was built as surface flow flume with concrete and waterproof material the surface flow flume was 10 cm lower than the soil in runoff plots two large buckets 1 0 m3 with drainage pvc hoses were used to sample total surface flow and interflow the amount of runoff was measured with water flowmeter after each precipitation event as a total 22 round of samples in surface flow and interflow were collected during study period soil moisture was monitored in four layers 10 20 40 and 100 cm in the upslope middle and downslope of the runoff plot using a soil moisture sensor and a cx 23x datalogger campbell scientific inc usa 2 2 4 doc concentrations and hydrochemical analyses all water samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm mixed cellulose membrane jiuding gaoke co ltd china and stored at 4 in the laboratory basic water chemistry properties ph electrical conductivity total dissolved solids tds and redox potential orp of precipitation throughfall stemflow soil solution stream and groundwater and surface flow and interflow leachate were determined with a portable ph meter ultrameter 6ii myron l company usa filtered samples were acidified with phosphoric acid and their total dissolved carbon dtc concentration and dic concentrations was measured using a toc analyzer vario toc cube elementar germany doc was calculated by subtracting dic from dtc iavorivska et al 2016 2 3 net carbon balance in headwater catchment annual doc balance at catchment scale was calculated with the following equation f plant f p f stream f g f soil where fplant and fp were net input doc fluxes kg c km 2 yr 1 in plant derived dust and exudates and in precipitation respectively fstream and fg were output doc fluxes in streamflow and groundwater respectively fsoil was soil buffered doc flux the net input doc fluxes in precipitation fp and plant derived exudates and dust fplant were calculated on an annual basis as follows f p c p f tf f sf p f plant f tf f sf f tf c tf c p f tf p f sf c sf c p f sf p where cp ctf and csf were weighted mean doc concentration mg l 1 based on water discharge in precipitation throughfall and stemflow respectively p was total precipitation mm yr 1 outside the forest ftf and fsf were the proportions of throughfall and stemflow accounted for total precipitation respectively ftf and fsf were doc fluxes kg c km 2 yr 1 in throughfall and stemflow respectively the output doc fluxes in streamflow fstream and groundwater fg were calculated with the loadest model runkel et al 2004 song et al 2021 f stream l o a d e s t q stream c stream f g l o a d e s t q g c g where fstream and fg were doc fluxes kg c

downstream weir qg was groundwater discharge mm calculated with the xinanjiang model song et al 2021 in addition ecosystem nep was measured with an eddy covariance system mounted on a tower at 39 6 m above ground with an open path co2 h2o analyzer li 7500 li cor inc usa and a three dimensional sonic anemometer csat3 campbell scientific inc usa flux variables were sampled at 10 hz online using a cr5000 datalogger model cr5000 campbell scientific inc usa and post 30 min mean fluxes were calculated wen et al 2006 wen et al 2010 3 results 3 1 net carbon balance and its components in a headwater catchment total annual doc flux in throughfall 25 576 kg c km 2 yr 1 and stemflow 1707 kg c km 2 yr 1 was 27 283 kg c km 2 yr 1 and export doc fluxes in streamflow and groundwater were 5912 and 3905 kg c km 2 yr 1 respectively table 1 the deficit between input and export doc fluxes buffered by soil was 17 466 kg c km 2 yr 1 for comparison soil buffered doc fluxes would be 4851 kg c km 2 yr 1 without considering doc deposition by vegetation net doc fluxes derived from precipitation subtracting canopy interception of 19 5 were 4966 kg c km 2 yr 1 the net input fluxes of plant derived doc were 22 317 kg c km 2 yr 1 in addition the nep in this subtropical catchment ecosystem was 6 38 105 in 2019 and 5 11 105 kg c km 2 yr 1 in 2020 therefore soil buffered doc served as an effective carbon sink that accounted for 3 04 of nep plant derived doc accounted for 3 88 of nep affected by the subtropical monsoon climate doc fluxes in precipitation streamflow and groundwater exhibited seasonal variability fig 3 most of the doc transport 90 from precipitation to stream and groundwater occurred in wet season march to august daily doc flux in precipitation were estimated at up to 410 kg c km 2 day 1 which accounted for 6 6 of the annual doc flux 3 2 doc concentrations from vegetation canopy to stream water and groundwater doc concentrations from vegetation canopy to stream water and groundwater showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing fig 4 doc concentration in throughfall and stemflow was significantly higher than that in precipitation p 0 01 doc concentration increased from the litter layer to topsoil at 10 cm depth and then decreased from topsoil to deep subsoil doc concentration in litter leachate was also higher than that of throughfall p 0 01 doc concentration significantly decreased from topsoil 0 10 cm to middle subsoil 10 40 cm and deep subsoil 40 100 cm p 0 01 due to differences in hydrological flow paths doc concentration in surface flow was higher than that in interflow p 0 01 while it had no significant difference with that in litter leachate p 0 55 dynamics of doc concentration in atmosphere plant soil continuum reflected doc enrichment in plants and surface soil leaching and subsoil absorption processes 3 3 dependence of plant derived doc concentrations on ph doc concentrations in stemflow and throughfall were significantly higher than those in precipitation p 0 001 doc was positively negatively and non significantly correlated with ph in throughfall r 0 41 p 0 005 stemflow r 0 66 p 0 001 and precipitation r 0 19 p 0 382 respectively fig 5 linear regression further showed the dependence of plant derived doc concentrations on ph correlations between doc and ph in stemflow and throughfall were exactly the opposite stemflow had more doc but lower ph than throughfall p 0 001 3 4 dependence of soil buffered doc on hydrochemical factors though both the litter layer and topsoil 0 10 cm acted as doc sources in doc leaching process the relationships between doc concentration and ph in litter leachate negative and topsoil solution positive were opposite table 2 fig 6 doc was also negatively correlated with ph in the middle subsoil but not correlated in deep subsoil the ph in litter leachate was significantly lower than that in all soil solutions p 0 01 doc concentrations were positively correlated with tds in litter leachate and all soil solutions p 0 01 the relationships between doc and ph and between doc and tds in surface flow were similar to those of litter leachate due to similar hydrological paths fig 6 affected by soil doc leaching and absorption processes both relationships between doc and ph and between doc and tds in interflow streamflow and groundwater were insignificant in addition orp were higher than 100 mv and had insignificant correlations with doc concentrations in all water samples table 2 4 discussion 4 1 contribution of plant derived doc to net ecosystem carbon balance 4 1 1 input fluxes from plant derived and precipitation doc total doc input fluxes from plant derived 22 317 kg c km 2 year 1 and precipitation doc 4966 kg c km 2 year 1 were 27 283 kg c km 2 year 1 table 1 plants affect doc deposition through canopy interception and leaching from plant surfaces levia et al 2011 in this study the canopy intercepted 1203 kg c km 2 year 1 of precipitation doc which was equivalent to 4 41 of the total doc input fluxes both dust deposited in the canopies and leaf exudates contribute doc in throughfall and stemflow levia et al 2011 gonzalez ollauri et al 2020 the plant derived doc in throughfall and stemflow dominated 81 8 of total doc input fluxes as the highest doc concentration but minimum water volume 2 3 of precipitation stemflow accounted for 7 02 of plant derived doc fluxes however stemflow together with root induced preferential flow formed a unique double funneling channel gonzalez ollauri et al 2020 through which the highly concentrated and bioavailable doc infiltrated the soil around plant roots most likely affecting the activity of rhizosphere microorganisms and nutrient absorption by plant roots van der putten et al 2013 sokol and bradford 2019 bulk precipitation doc flux 6169 kg c km 2 year 1 in the headwater catchment in this study was in the high range compared to global mean fluxes 3400 3300 kg c km 2 year 1 iavorivska et al 2016 first precipitation in this subtropical area was higher 1438 mm year 1 than the global mean due to the subtropical monsoon climate second precipitation doc concentration at our site 4 29 mg l 1 was also higher than the global mean 2 64 1 9 mg l 1 iavorivska et al 2016 possible sources of doc in precipitation were fuel and biomass burning biogenic aerosols and volatile organic carbon voc coelho et al 2008 pantelaki et al 2018 voc emissions from forests pinus fir picea quercus and so on might be primary source of vocs in precipitation klinger et al 2002 yu et al 2017 our headwater catchment had a high vocs emission 2 68 g c m 2 yr 1 which was higher than the mean concentration in china 1 35 g c m 2 yr 1 and europe 0 51 g c m 2 yr 1 simpson et al 1999 klinger et al 2002 dissolution of land surface vocs may contribute to high doc concentration in precipitation in our site 4 1 2 plant derived doc regulated by dust and exudates dry dust and leaf exudates leached with throughfall while organic matter formed by the degradation of the tree outer bark was washed by stemflow differences in sources and residence time led to the different characteristics of doc in throughfall and stemflow levia et al 2011 chen et al 2017 degradation of slash pine masson pine and fir bark would release acidic organic compounds and simultaneously increase the doc content and reduce ph of stemflow keiluweit et al 2015 the negative relationship between doc and ph in stemflow at our site table 2 indicated a contribution by the dissolution of plant derived acid organic compounds additionally differences in ph between throughfall and precipitation indicated the canopy s buffering effect on precipitation ph howard et al 2018 during canopy leaching ion exchange between precipitation and canopy may contribute to the buffering of throughfall ph levia et al 2011 the longer contact time between stemflow and tree trunk than that between precipitation and canopy is beneficial to organic acid dissolution fröberg et al 2007 bioavailability and solubility of doc in canopy leachate stemflow and litter leachate is generally higher than that of doc in soil kopáček et al 2017 howard et al 2018 kopáček et al 2018 in an indoor culture experiment 36 73 of the doc in throughfall was mineralized within 4 days howard et al 2018 plant derived macromolecular organic matter is first degraded to small molecule organic matter roth et al 2019 sokol and bradford 2019 after infiltrating into the soil plant derived small molecule organic matter rapidly decreased while soil derived macromolecular organic matter increased with soil depth kaiser and kalbitz 2012 scott and rothstein 2014 this indicates that plant derived organic carbon is preferentially decomposed by microorganisms and transformed into macromolecular microbial organic carbon which is then complexed with soil minerals for protection against further decomposition roth et al 2019 4 2 contribution of soil buffered doc to net ecosystem carbon balance 4 2 1 soil buffered doc as a carbon sink soil served as a carbon sink by immobilizing doc 17466 kg c km 2 yr 1 namely 3 04 of nep in this subtropical plantation headwater catchment table 1 the dynamics of doc leaching from litter and topsoil and doc absorption in subsoil 10 cm regulated the deficit between aboveground doc input and total output fluxes chen et al 2021 found that plant carbon input was the major contributor to topsoil 10 cm carbon destabilization and mineral protection by iron and aluminum oxides and cations became more important in preserving som in middle subsoil 20 cm studies also found that plant derived doc is mostly held in the surface soil while doc in deep subsoil was sourced mainly from microbial metabolites and upper soil doc leaching schwesig et al 2003 müller et al 2009 toosi et al 2012 our study found that the adsorption effect on plant derived doc of exists in whole soil profile 0 100 cm which could apparently increase soil sequestration of exogenous doc a soil column leaching study found that exogenous doc is mostly adsorbed by iron and aluminum oxides in topsoil 5 5 cm müller et al 2009 while doc in subsoil is derived from by products of extracellular enzyme decomposition and microbial assimilation toosi et al 2012 though laboratory based studies have shown that exogenous doc primes soil respiration soil immobilization of exogenous doc still serves as a short term carbon sink zhou et al 2016 kaiser and kalbitz 2012 proposed a view of cycling downwards to describe doc leaching from surface soil to deep soil during leaching process both adsorption of reactive minerals and microbial transformation buffered doc inputs and outputs generally 70 of the doc in the soil solution originated from soil sources rather than exogenous doc müller et al 2009 scott and rothstein 2014 east asian monsoon subtropical forests in china exhibited an average nep of 362 39 g c m 2 year 1 in the 1990 s and 2000 s yu et al 2014 due to the frequency of precipitation and low surface runoff coefficient about 64 of input doc was sequestered by soil at our site the soil buffered doc served as an overlooked carbon sink and accounted for about 4 82 of the average nep in subtropical forests in china 4 2 2 soil buffered doc regulated by biophysical and chemical adsorption soil buffering of doc is a systematic process which includes adsorption on reactive minerals microbial transformations and re release into the soil solution during doc leaching through the soil profile kaiser and kalbitz 2012 scott and rothstein 2014 lee et al 2018 leinemann et al 2018 doc with high aromaticity high molecular weight and low biodegradability is easily adsorbed by soil while doc with low aromaticity relatively small molecular weight and high biodegradability is more likely to be released into water bodies kaiser and kalbitz 2012 scott and rothstein 2014 main factors affecting mineral adsorption of doc include ph ionic strength and redox potential hagedorn et al 2012 musolff et al 2017 kopáček et al 2018 sanclements et al 2018 both ph and tds positively correlated with doc concentration in the soil profile in this study table 2 indicating that acidity change and ionic strength mechanisms affected solubility of organic carbon in soil sanclements et al 2012 sanclements et al 2018 studies found the hydroxyl oh groups on fe al oxides could form covalent bonds between som carboxyl and phenolic oh groups through ligand exchange that results in the direct and strong adsorption of som finley et al 2018 soc solubility increases with increasing ph as hydroxide ions decrease protonation of carboxylic functional groups neutralize positive charges and lead to more hydrophilic organic matter ekström et al 2011 sanclements et al 2018 concentration of tds in soil solution is closely related to ionic strength and reflects electrical conductivity sastre de vicente 2004 tiemeyer et al 2017 the hydrochemical characteristics tds ionic strength and electrical conductivity were based on basic cations k na ca2 mg2 etc and main anions so4 2 no3 cl co3 2 hco3 etc several studies have shown that high ionic strength reduces doc concentrations hruška et al 2009 clark et al 2011 the negatively charged mineral surfaces could adsorb the negatively charged som through polyvalent cation bridging formed by cations such as ca2 and mg2 rowley et al 2018 singh et al 2018 tiemeyer et al 2017 also found positive correlations between doc and electrical conductivity in soil solution in a field study hruška et al 2009 found that long term increases in stream water doc were correlated with only modest increases in stream ph but large declines in ionic strength in a catchment in germany the reason for these differences may be that cation concentrations may be too low to cause coagulation and bridging until an inflection point at which ionic strength begins to decrease doc concentrations under field conditions tiemeyer et al 2017 furthermore the positive correlations between doc and tds may be attributed to soil hydrologic processes the strong leaching effect in this subtropical plantation led to synchronous leaching of doc and ions high orp indicates a redox environment that limits iron reduction and fe ligand doc release barré et al 2014 however the relatively high orp 100mv in all water samples in our study indicated a constant redox environment that led to insignificant relationships between orp and doc fig 6 the high orp facilitated complexation reactions between organic carbon and soil minerals lending stability to soil organic carbon musolff et al 2017 tiemeyer et al 2017 5 conclusions the net plant derived doc flux 22 317 kg c km 2 yr 1 was about 4 5 times higher than the net doc flux in precipitation 4 966 kg c km 2 yr 1 accounting for 3 88 of nep in this headwater catchment in the subtropical forest plantation soil buffered doc served as a carbon sink for 17 466 kg c km 2 yr 1 accounting for 3 04 of nep plant derived doc contributed 81 8 of total doc input fluxes and should not be overlooked positive correlations between doc and ph in soil solutions indicated that reducing soil acidification was help to soil sequestration of plant derived doc the dynamic exchange of plant derived doc and soil buffered doc resulted in a substantial carbon sink our results stressed the importance of both wet and dry deposition of doc and the soil buffer function on doc inputs and outputs in the subtropical plantation ecosystem these

3591,traditional centralized water management systems have tended to fall short in delivering environmental and amenity benefits in urban areas water sensitive urban design wsud projects have been proposed as an alternative due to their ability to generate multiple benefits including improving water quality water supply aesthetics urban cooling spaces for recreation and habitat for biodiversity however in most cities investment in such systems has been relatively low in part due to the difficulty of monetizing the multifunctional benefits of wsud projects and including them in comprehensive economic analyses we describe the development testing and application of inffews investment framework for the economics of water sensitive cities an economic decision support system for investment in wsud projects inffews is based on a benefit cost analysis bca framework and is consistent with standard bca a prominent feature of the framework is its strong emphasis on quantifying the monetary equivalent values of intangible non market benefits from wsud projects development of the tools and their supporting materials has involved extensive consultation with intended users review of

quantifying the monetary equivalent values of intangible non market benefits from wsud projects development of the tools and their supporting materials has involved extensive consultation with intended users review of existing tools and primary research in this paper we describe the development process of the framework outline its main components and present some examples of its application we aim to draw lessons for wider and more effective application of these tools and other tools of this type 2 current investment decision making process in the urban water sector in australia the application of a systematic decision support system for investment decisions is common in the australian urban water sector cost effectiveness analysis multicriteria analysis and benefit cost analysis are the three most commonly used frameworks to evaluate projects furlong et al 2017 cost effectiveness analysis is used to find the least cost option to achieve a specified target or objective by comparing multiple solutions or options suitable to achieve the same objective cost effectiveness analysis sidesteps the need to compare projects that generate different types of benefits or to monetise the benefits however in reality different projects rarely generate exactly the same package of benefits and the approach taken in cost effectiveness analysis means that it is not possible to account for their differences smart water fund 2011 simplistic bca which focuses only on the financial benefit to the project organization or utility is often used however the types of benefits and costs used in these kinds of analyses are quite narrow for example furlong et al 2017 discussed case study applications of bca for infrastructure options in east pakenham and casey clyde victoria where a long run marginal cost concept was used to capture the savings in the utility s expenditure if a certain option is implemented the benefit of implementing a new system was estimated by the amount of additional capacity either removal of wastewater stormwater or addition of potable water simple bca could be useful for assessing projects which primarily generate water quantity benefits however they are not sufficient for assessing projects for which non financial intangible benefits e g aesthetics and biodiversity are important mann 2016 some water utilities and local governments rely on multi criteria analysis mca to assess projects with multiple types of benefits mca allows users to assign weights to different types of benefits and costs lai et al 2008 the weights are usually derived from expert opinion or stakeholder consultations potential limitations of this approach include that participants may not be representative of the broader community they may hold personal biases regarding the various benefits of a project skrydstrup et al 2020 and that some mcas are not based on with project versus without project comparisons large organizations with adequate resources are more likely to employ comprehensive bcas some organisations have in house capabilities and resources to conduct such analyses while others engage external consultants local governments and smaller organizations often lack the capacity to undertake comprehensive bcas and they rely less on such analyses when making investment decisions as a consequence there has been a lack of rigorous assessment of different water management options and decisions often have not been based on net benefits in a recent review of the current status of integrated urban water management in australia the productivity commission 2020 recommended increasing the capacity of organizations to assess costs and benefits across the whole water cycle incorporate the interrelationships and consider a broad range of outcomes over different planning stages and scales two key challenges which inffews tools directly address are the lack of capacity to incorporate non market or intangible benefits and to understand the distributional impacts of costs and benefits of a proposed project 3 inffews in this section we present a brief overview of the development processes undertaken to develop the investment framework for economics of water sensitive cities inffews package and the different components of it 3 1 development and testing stages a thorough research based and end user focussed approach was undertaken to develop inffews to make it relevant to users the key steps followed to develop the package are presented in fig 1 and described below 3 1 1 literature review at the initial stage of the development process an extensive review of australian and international literature on non market values of water sensitive systems and practices was carried out the review identified more than 180 studies and the results have been summarized in gunawardena et al 2017 standard textbooks and government policy documents were reviewed to ensure that the framework reflects the best practice guidelines guidelines for conducting bca are published by most state governments and the national government in australia these were reviewed to ensure that the bca tool developed would be compliant with government requirements 3 1 2 review of existing databases several national and international databases on non market values of environmental goods and services were reviewed e g nyc green infrastructure co benefits calculator set social and environment tool by mja ciria best benefits of suds tool ecological accounting protocol a tool to calculate the opportunity cost of drainage infrastructure catchment investment analysis tool ciat usgs benefit transfer toolkit https sciencebase usgs gov benefit transfer crc for bushfire and natural hazards value tool database threatened species database environmental valuation reference inventory https www evri ca en splashify splash set social and environment tool by water corporation and envalue it was found that while these databases contain much useful information they do not contain adequate information necessary to evaluate water sensitive projects in australia iftekhar et al 2017 see appendix a for a review of the databases considered during the development of the tool 3 1 3 review of existing tools at first information was collected about available tools for bca or related purposes the following bca tools were reviewed catchment management investment standard detailed guidelines on investment and a tool inffer investment framework for environmental resources the i tree suite of tools awrcoe recycled water economic assessment tool and blackspot funding benefit cost ratio tool pannell 2017 where possible a copy of each tool was obtained and run on microcomputer the main characteristics and key strengths and weaknesses were captured for each tool it was found that the existing bca tools vary widely in their user friendliness structure comprehensiveness and level of support most tend to be focused on a relatively narrow context such as projects for catchments urban trees urban drainage or water recycling each of which has a dedicated bca tool from somewhere in the world there was no existing bca tool that is usable across a broad range of investment types i e all of the above project types and more and is specifically designed for projects with a focus on water sensitive outcomes ciria best is designed to deal with a wide ranging set of benefits that are relevant to water sensitive city projects but it does not provide a full bca inffer is broadly relevant but it is not specifically designed for water sensitive city projects there is incomplete information available about the levels of usage of the various tools but overall stakeholder consultations suggest that most existing tools are used much less than hoped or expected for example the catchment management investment standard and its spreadsheet tool catchment investment analysis tool ciat were commissioned by the water services association of australia but it has had limited usage since see appendix b for a review of the bca tools considered during the development of the tool 3 1 4 stakeholder consultations one to one interviews with a wide range of stakeholders were carried out to understand their needs relevant tool developers and economists experienced in conducting bca were consulted to draw on their experience with developing and applying bca tools 3 1 5 development of the tools based on the feedback from the experts stakeholder consultations literature review review of bca guidelines and review of existing tools beta versions of the tools were developed and shared with more than 50 organizations 3 1 6 training the main developers of the tools provided training workshops in major cities in australia over two years 18 training sessions were conducted plus several webinars on average in each session there were 25 participants from a wide range of organizations utilities local government state government consultants academia and other research bodies the participants were asked to bring their own examples of projects to the training sessions this exercise not only provided hands on training to the participants but also allowed the developers to find bugs and opportunities to improve the tools the first completed version of the tools was released at the beginning of 2020 3 2 a brief description of functionality and different components inffews uses a standard bca framework that is fully consistent with the existing australian government guidelines it includes a benefit cost analysis tool pannell 2020b a value tool providing evidence on non market values iftekhar et al 2020a and extensive documentation to guide their application and decision making processes iftekhar et al 2020b pannell 2020a pannell 2020c pannell 2020d both the bca tool and value tool are spreadsheet based spreadsheet based tools are flexible and adaptable have required level of in built functionality and are familiar to end users olavson and fry 2008 a brief description of the two main components is presented below 3 2 1 the inffews benefit cost analysis bca tool the main purpose of the bca tool is to evaluate compare and rank projects this is done by estimating the net present value npv and benefit cost ratio bcr for each project to apply the tool the user goes through several steps clear definition of the project scenario identification of relevant types of benefits and costs quantification of those benefits and costs and attribution of costs and benefits to different stakeholders fig 2 calculations factor in cooperation with the project by relevant private individuals or businesses or other partner organisations and the risks of project failure results npv and bcr are calculated globally for all of the identified stakeholders and for the project organisation alone 3 2 1 1 definition of the scenarios in the first step the users have to define the with project and without project scenarios the without project scenario is used as the baseline and the difference between the without and with project scenarios guides the estimation of benefits and costs over the lifespan of the analysis the timing of benefits and costs are specified and discounting is used to express all benefits and costs as present values 3 2 1 2 consideration of diverse types of benefits the bca tool explicitly recognises the various types of ways that the benefits of a water sensitive project can be measured it has the capacity to incorporate benefit information in eight different ways 1 benefit per person on average or per household for a particular population 2 benefit per user specified unit 3 benefit per unit of abatement of a pollutant 4 total or aggregate benefit per year 5 delay or reduction in a cost 6 improved condition of an environmental or community asset expressed as a proportional benefit for the asset as a whole 7 reduced probability of a risky event occurring e g a flood and or reduced severity of losses if the risky event does occur and 8 custom benefits specified year by year the bca tool uses these benefit categories to collect the data for the necessary calculations 3 2 1 3 consideration of different types of cost the major categories of costs a water sensitive project could incur are the costs of initial project implementation including cash costs to the funder in kind costs to the lead organisation and private costs to participants ongoing costs to maintain the benefits generated by the project the opportunity cost of the funds invested in the projects which determines the discount rate and the cost of collecting funds through the tax system the excess burden of taxation the tool has full flexibility in terms of consideration of different types of costs 3 2 1 4 attribution of costs and benefits to different stakeholders one of the key features of the bca tool is the allocation of costs and benefits to different stakeholders users are asked to specify the allocation of each cost and benefit item across the affected stakeholders this information is later used to provide stakeholder level analysis of the distribution of benefits and costs 3 2 1 5 consideration of different types of project risks we mentioned above that one potential benefit resulting from a project or policy is a reduction in risk such as a flood event another relevant risk is the risk that the project fails to deliver its benefits there are several types of project risk that may be relevant technical risk socio political risk financial risk and management risk technical risk involves the failure of a project to deliver outcomes due to technical reasons such as natural calamities or engineering failure socio political risk could include community opposition to the project unwillingness of partner agencies to support the project or lack of conducive legal and institutional environment to implement the project financial risk refers to a lack of ongoing funding to maintain the project which is a challenge for many small scale water sensitive projects finally managerial risk could involve issues with poor governance and management of the project the bca tool guides the users to consider all these types of risks explicitly 3 2 1 6 adoption a factor in influencing the delivery of many water sensitive projects is the behaviour of a target group of community members or businesses who would need to adopt new practices for example a project might have a water savings target that relies on people s water conservation or their adoption of rainwater tanks however not everybody in the target group will actually adopt this behaviour benefits are adjusted to reflect judgements about the level of adoption that is realistic this is done by first estimating the benefits assuming full adoption and then scaling down the benefits to reflect judgements about the level of adoption that is realistic 3 2 1 7 outputs from the analysis the main evaluation metrics the bca tool produces are the bcr and npv which indicate whether it is worthwhile to invest in the project these are calculated for all of the identified stakeholders in aggregate and for the project organisation the body responsible for the project stakeholder specific costs and benefits information help in understanding the distributional consequences of a project and adopt appropriate decision rules for example overall results are not necessarily aligned with project organization results table 1 the overall npv might be positive but it might be negative for the project organization this is likely to influence decision making by the project organization or to prompt it to seek funding support from the project beneficiaries in addition to the aggregate results the tool also reports results for each benefit and each cost over time 3 2 1 8 sensitivity analysis and uncertainty the bca tool has an in built capacity that generates comprehensive sensitivity analysis this helps users to assess the impacts of uncertainty about the various inputs users specify simple discrete probability distributions for each benefit type as well as for adoption project risks and costs the tool employs a monte carlo approach conducting 1000 simulations based on random independent draws of the parameter values from the specified distributions based on the simulation results probability distributions are presented for npv and bcr this allows decision makers to assess how robust the results of the bca are in addition the tool calculates a sensitivity index for each benefit item adoption project risk and costs this uses the results of the simulations to indicate which of the factors has the greatest impact on the overall results this helps analysts or decision makers make judgements about which factors should be the main focus for collection of further information it also provides a break even value for each main variable which shows the percentage change in the variable needed to change the overall bcr to 1 together with the probability distributions described above this information helps decision makers to judge the robustness of results the tool also provides two simple sensitivity analyses that are required by some government agencies sensitivity to the discount rate and sensitivity to excluding the excess burden of taxation analysts are requested to record their information sources and are encouraged to submit their draft analysis for expert review the bca tool includes the facility for reviewers to record their comments about each part of the analysis and for analysts to record their responses to those comments the tool also provides the facility for analysts to rate the quality of the information used in the analysis further assisting decision makers to evaluate the analysis they have been given 3 2 1 9 quality assurance the tool provides a comprehensive checklist related to quality assurance of the analysis analysts are asked to enter information on whether and how they have responded to each item on the checklist and this too can be made available to decision makers to help them to make judgements about the quality of the analysis 3 2 1 10 comparing projects a separate spreadsheet is provided that facilitates the process of comparing bca results from different projects results for each project are imported into the comparison tool and decision makers can easily observe how their results vary 3 2 2 the inffews value tool lack of easily accessible information on the non market values of water sensitive projects has been identified as a major constraint to the building of strong business cases for those projects iftekhar et al 2018 iftekhar et al 2019 original non market valuation studies can be expensive and time consuming to carry out and require skills that may not be present in an organization benefit transfer is an established method that guides the extrapolation of the results of existing non market value studies to a new context benefit transfer methods have been applied to evaluate environmental policies in some countries including united states europe and australia newbold et al 2018 however successful application of benefit transfer method requires access to some technical expertise and good quality data iftekhar et al 2021b the value tool assists by collating and synthesising existing non market value information relevant to water sensitive systems and practices in australia the associated guideline provides detailed information about how to apply benefit transfer methods using the information contained in the tool the value tool has been designed to apply two of the most common benefit transfer methods unit value transfer and benefit function transfer boyle et al 2010 each is summarised briefly below 3 2 2 1 unit value transfer unit value transfer involves applying a single or a set of relevant non market value estimates to the project application site johnston et al 2015 if the context of the sites from which the original values were collected match the context of the new site for which the bca is being done then the original estimates could be applied directly such direct transfer of unit values from one site to another is the easiest but the crudest approach more often some adjustment is necessary as the study and application sites do not exactly match various socio economic and biophysical factors can be used to adjust unit values including income age group and the physical condition of the site navrud and ready 2007 the value tool allows the transfer of either adjusted or unadjusted unit values the current version of the tool contains 2 370 non market benefit values or records from 192 australian studies that are related to investment in water sensitive systems and practices eighty eight percent of them are economic estimates that could be directly used for benefit transfer the remaining number of records around 12 contain non economic estimates such as psychological well being measures based on some standard scale reduction in temperature due to green roofs etc which could be used in association with other economic values to estimate the total value of a project the records contained in the value tool have been classified in various ways to facilitate exploration and finding of suitable information one classification that establishes a direct connection between the bca tool and the value tool is based on benefit types the records have been divided into 20 different benefit types the top five benefit types with most records are improved opportunities for recreation 19 ecological improvement and biodiversity 18 improved security for water supply 18 reduced morbidity and improved health 12 and non monetized values 12 fig 3 to assist with the adjusted unit value transfer the tool provides seven types of information on each record iftekhar et al 2020b 1 study identification unique id for records and study citation and the title of the study 2 value classification value location i e where the data has been collected classification of the records according to benefit types theme value types and context 3 marginal change measures type of marginal changes e g consumer surplus implicit price cost etc definition of marginal change i e exactly how the values have been reported unit of measurement e g household person etc frequency of payment e g annual monthly etc adjusted monetary values based on the consumer price index original estimates the year used to adjust the estimates mean or median estimate reported confidence intervals of the estimates reported standard deviation of the original estimate payment method survey year cpi ratios and currency 4 sample characteristics the country of the study the state within which the study was located study location i e where the data has been collected the population of the study site number of respondents response rate sample age percentage of male mean sample income and education level 5 methodology the kind of valuation method used the broad category of method data collection method the number of valid respondents estimation models used 6 publication characteristics the full reference to the study the link to the original source of the study type of publication 7 quality assessment a subjective assessment by the tool developer whether the study was peer reviewed or not subjective assessment of the clarity of the definition of marginal change whether the study clearly specified variability of estimates whether there was sufficient background information on the study site a combined aggregate quality assessment score is reported 3 2 2 2 benefit function transfer non market valuation studies often report statistical models e g regression analysis that could be used to derive a statistical relationship between the non market value of a good or service e g a park and a set of explanatory variables such as the size of the park location of the park distance of houses from the park socio economic status of the local residents etc by applying site specific values for the explanatory variables it is possible to estimate the value of a project there are two main requirements of a benefit function transfer parameterised function from the original study and information about the set of variables in the value tool parametrized functions for selected benefits are given and the users are asked to provide information about relevant variables the value tool contains the following four types of parameterized functions for specific benefits 1 aesthetic benefit of wetlands bushland and golf courses parameterized functions of the relationship between percentage change in the property price with the average distance and size of a wetland bushland and golf courses based on pandit et al 2014 the user enters information on the mean area of the feature e g wetland and the mean distance of houses from it the percentage increase in median property price due to the feature e g wetland is calculated 2 salinity reduction benefit from stormwater management industry this function is based on kandulu et al 2014 the user provides information on the salinity levels for harvested water stormwater alternative sources e g river water and total volume of treated stormwater used in the industry the function calculates the monetary value of the salinity reduction benefits 3 salinity reduction benefit from stormwater management household this function is based on dandy et al 2014 the user provides information on salinity levels for harvested water stormwater alternative sources e g river water and the number of affected households the function calculates the monetary value of the salinity reduction benefits 4 flood damage look up tables these tables provide a relationship between flood depth and damage based on the state of queensland 2018 there are three separate look up tables for three types of damages to the household internal damage structural damage and external damage it also has two separate look up tables for small and medium sized businesses and large businesses the user can identify the monetary estimates of expected damage to different types of houses and businesses due to a flood with a certain depth 3 3 access to and future development of the tools the crc for water sensitive cities has completed its activities as of 2021 water sensitive cities australia wsca has been established to continue the work of the crcwsc both tools are accessible from wsca s website https watersensitivecities org au tools users can download the bca tool for free after registering at the site the value tool is also available for download from the site however access to the value tool requires a subscription fee unless the organization or individual is already a member of the crcwsc wsca five private consultancy farms with economics expertise have been engaged to provide training and support services to potential users of the tools the lead developers iftekhar and pannell of the tools will continue to work with the wsca to provide training engage in consultancy and research projects and update the tools regularly for example an upgrade of the bca tool was released in late 2021 an updated version of the value tool is being planned to be released in 2022 for international applications interested parties are encouraged to contact wsca and or the lead developers 4 applications of inffews the inffews package has been developed and designed to meet the needs of four main groups of users 1 large utilities and government agencies who have in house economic expertise and access to standard bca tools but may lack relevant non market value information 2 local governments and smaller organizations who may not have in house capacity to undertake comprehensive bcas and rely on external consultants to undertake bca work on their behalf 3 consultants who undertake bcas regularly but may lack relevant non market value information and 4 academics and researchers who are interested in the economic assessment of water sensitive systems and practices but may not have access to appropriate tools guidelines and data iftekhar et al 2017 the tool has been shared with more than 132 organizations among them 30 are consulting firms 24 councils 19 government departments and treasuries 14 utilities 10 academic and research organizations and 3 alliances the framework has been reviewed by several organizations and groups such as metropolitan investment and evaluation group victoria nsw treasury nsw public sector cost benefit analysis best practice group sa treasury melbourne water corporation conducted by marsden jacobs associates nsw department of planning industry and environment dpie and sydney water conducted by aurecon group they have been written into guidelines nsw department of planning industry and environment coastal management cba guidelines blacktown city council tender submission guidelines hunter valley tender submission guidelines and city west water position description the tools have been applied to a large number of case studies to evaluate water sensitive projects the examples in table 2 show that the tools have been used to assess and evaluate a wide range of water sensitive features such as rehabilitation of waterways constructed wetlands passive recreation area passive irrigation green roof integrated water management plans alternative water supply water sensitive infill options and water sensitive city planning options comments from users reveal that the tools are serving their intended purpose of facilitating comprehensive economic assessment of water sensitive projects 5 discussion and concluding remarks through our interactions with users of the tools several key reflections and lessons have emerged which could potentially be useful for future tool developers and users in other places it was very important to engage early with the end users to identify and co design the key features and attributes of the tools iftekhar et al 2017 we have followed a systematic stakeholder engagement process guided by a project steering committee consisting of experienced practitioners from different parts of the water industry siebentritt et al 2017 releasing beta versions provided end users with the opportunity to know the tools and trial them before testing them on real world case studies most of the current investment decision support systems used by water utilities and local governments lack the capacity to consider a whole of system views and focus mostly on their own organizational perspective focusing on own organizational perspective is quite acceptable for very well defined projects with a clear demarcation of benefits and costs attributable to a single agency inffews can be easily applied to evaluate such projects however many water sensitive projects do not have such a clear boundary they provide benefits of various types to a number of groups in the community adoption of inffews facilitates the evaluation of such projects as it captures the full range of benefit types and the distributions of costs and benefits i e who pays and who benefits it assists the user of the tools to adopt a holistic thinking process and consider all the possible stakeholders of a project in some organisations investment decisions have relied on cost effectiveness analysis however the adoption of inffews requires a shift from a cost effectiveness approach to a net benefit approach for decision making it places a more rigorous focus on outcomes rectifying one of the common limitations of the existing decision making process in the water sector productivity commission 2020 in the past many water sensitive projects have failed to get funding due to a lack of strong business cases demonstrating the full value of the projects incorporation of the value of intangible benefits i e non market benefits increases the likelihood that overall benefits will outweigh the costs of a water sensitive project the value tool provides curated detailed data on non market values which has made it easier to incorporate such information into the analysis the establishment of an industry standard investment decision framework and tools could increase the efficiency of analysis and decision making in the water sector inffews has reduced the cost of economic data collection and analysis thereby encouraging more bcas of water sensitive projects this will ultimately facilitate the adoption of those water sensitive projects with the greatest net benefits in conclusion many cities and urban areas in australia are going through major transformations due to population growth climate change and increasing demands for natural amenities policy makers and water utilities are facing challenges in meeting growing demands for water for potable agricultural industrial and environmental purposes the inffews package has the potential to meet a key gap in the urban water sector in australia i e a comprehensive evaluation framework and methodology to assess water sensitive projects and policies however the adoption and application of the tools are at an early stage upscaling and wider application of the tools will depend on end users seeing value in them having confidence in their accuracy and acceptability to funding agencies such as departments of treasury and finance and having confidence that necessary support is available credit authorship contribution statement md sayed iftekhar conceptualization methodology investigation software writing original draft writing

3591,traditional centralized water management systems have tended to fall short in delivering environmental and amenity benefits in urban areas water sensitive urban design wsud projects have been proposed as an alternative due to their ability to generate multiple benefits including improving water quality water supply aesthetics urban cooling spaces for recreation and habitat for biodiversity however in most cities investment in such systems has been relatively low in part due to the difficulty of monetizing the multifunctional benefits of wsud projects and including them in comprehensive economic analyses we describe the development testing and application of inffews investment framework for the economics of water sensitive cities an economic decision support system for investment in wsud projects inffews is based on a benefit cost analysis bca framework and is consistent with standard bca a prominent feature of the framework is its strong emphasis on quantifying the monetary equivalent values of intangible non market benefits from wsud projects development of the tools and their supporting materials has involved extensive consultation with intended users review of existing tools and primary research over eight years 2013 2020 the frameworks can be applied to business case development and decision making at multiple levels in public sector and private sector organisations keywords australia benefit transfer benefit cost analysis economic analysis nature based solutions non market values water sensitive urban design 1 introduction traditionally urban water management has been perceived as an engineering challenge disjointed parallel efforts have been taken to manage water quality public health water security reliability and sanitation wastewater drains and pipes have been considered as the main solution head 2014 however in the face of increasing population pressure growing demand for amenity and liveability improvement and climate change impacts traditional water management systems are facing challenges further there is increased pressure on water utilities to improve the efficiency of their investments iftekhar et al 2021a sandhu and wratten 2013 recognizing the limitations of traditional centralized water management systems the water sensitive urban design concept wsud has been developed the wsud concept integrates different stages of the urban water cycle including water supply stormwater groundwater and wastewater management into the urban design brown and farrelly 2009 to enhance sustainable urban development similar approaches are known as sustainable urban drainage systems suds best management practices bmp low impact development lid green infrastructure gi landscape based stormwater management lsm water smart development wsd integrated urban water management iuwm and active beautiful clean waters abc waters approach in different countries buurman et al 2021 wsud systems and practices generate multiple benefits including water supply water quality amenity biodiversity and urban heat mitigation some of these benefits are tangible and easily quantifiable such as water savings benefit on the other hand other types of benefits are intangible often distributed across a broad range of social groups locations and time and difficult to quantify for example the amenity benefit of street trees while the tangible benefits are easy to identify and incorporate into economic analysis intangible benefits are often difficult to include in economic assessments due to the lack of appropriate monetized values wong et al 2013 in such situations intangible benefits may be ignored in the formal investment decision framework resulting in wsud projects not being selected for investment gunawardena et al 2020 australia recognized the importance of adopting wsud concepts early radcliffe 2019 in the national water initiative nwi of 2004 innovation and capacity building to create water sensitive australian cities is a stated goal clause 92 p20 coag 2004 in a recent review the productivity commission 2020 found that current urban water management is effective in meeting the demand for safe water supply and wastewater disposal however the current system is lagging in integrating stormwater into the water cycle and delivering amenity and liveability benefits to residents to accelerate the transition of australian cities to becoming water sensitive a cooperative research centre for water sensitive cities crcwsc was established in 2012 by the australian government crcs are large scale initiatives with the objective of connecting academic research to industry and government to meet their needs the crcwsc had over 100 partners in industry and different levels of government during extensive consultations to formulate the research programs for the crcwsc the development of a comprehensive investment decision framework for the specific context of water sensitive cities was identified as a major need the crcwsc s partners including state government agencies local governments and water utilities identified the need for them to have a greater capacity for economic analysis that recognises the broader benefits of water sensitive cities in response the crc undertook an extensive research program over eight years 2013 2020 to develop an investment framework inffews investment framework for the economics of water sensitive cities inffews is based on a benefit cost analysis bca framework and is consistent with standard bca a prominent feature of the framework is its strong emphasis on quantifying the monetary equivalent values of intangible non market benefits from wsud projects development of the tools and their supporting materials has involved extensive consultation with intended users review of existing tools and primary research in this paper we describe the development process of the framework outline its main components and present some examples of its application we aim to draw lessons for wider and more effective application of these tools and other tools of this type 2 current investment decision making process in the urban water sector in australia the application of a systematic decision support system for investment decisions is common in the australian urban water sector cost effectiveness analysis multicriteria analysis and benefit cost analysis are the three most commonly used frameworks to evaluate projects furlong et al 2017 cost effectiveness analysis is used to find the least cost option to achieve a specified target or objective by comparing multiple solutions or options suitable to achieve the same objective cost effectiveness analysis sidesteps the need to compare projects that generate different types of benefits or to monetise the benefits however in reality different projects rarely generate exactly the same package of benefits and the approach taken in cost effectiveness analysis means that it is not possible to account for their differences smart water fund 2011 simplistic bca which focuses only on the financial benefit to the project organization or utility is often used however the types of benefits and costs used in these kinds of analyses are quite narrow for example furlong et al 2017 discussed case study applications of bca for infrastructure options in east pakenham and casey clyde victoria where a long run marginal cost concept was used to capture the savings in the utility s expenditure if a certain option is implemented the benefit of implementing a new system was estimated by the amount of additional capacity either removal of wastewater stormwater or addition of potable water simple bca could be useful for assessing projects which primarily generate water quantity benefits however they are not sufficient for assessing projects for which non financial intangible benefits e g aesthetics and biodiversity are important mann 2016 some water utilities and local governments rely on multi criteria analysis mca to assess projects with multiple types of benefits mca allows users to assign weights to different types of benefits and costs lai et al 2008 the weights are usually derived from expert opinion or stakeholder consultations potential limitations of this approach include that participants may not be representative of the broader community they may hold personal biases regarding the various benefits of a project skrydstrup et al 2020 and that some mcas are not based on with project versus without project comparisons large organizations with adequate resources are more likely to employ comprehensive bcas some organisations have in house capabilities and resources to conduct such analyses while others engage external consultants local governments and smaller organizations often lack the capacity to undertake comprehensive bcas and they rely less on such analyses when making investment decisions as a consequence there has been a lack of rigorous assessment of different water management options and decisions often have not been based on net benefits in a recent review of the current status of integrated urban water management in australia the productivity commission 2020 recommended increasing the capacity of organizations to assess costs and benefits across the whole water cycle incorporate the interrelationships and consider a broad range of outcomes over different planning stages and scales two key challenges which inffews tools directly address are the lack of capacity to incorporate non market or intangible benefits and to understand the distributional impacts of costs and benefits of a proposed project 3 inffews in this section we present a brief overview of the development processes undertaken to develop the investment framework for economics of water sensitive cities inffews package and the different components of it 3 1 development and testing stages a thorough research based and end user focussed approach was undertaken to develop inffews to make it relevant to users the key steps followed to develop the package are presented in fig 1 and described below 3 1 1 literature review at the initial stage of the development process an extensive review of australian and international literature on non market values of water sensitive systems and practices was carried out the review identified more than 180 studies and the results have been summarized in gunawardena et al 2017 standard textbooks and government policy documents were reviewed to ensure that the framework reflects the best practice guidelines guidelines for conducting bca are published by most state governments and the national government in australia these were reviewed to ensure that the bca tool developed would be compliant with government requirements 3 1 2 review of existing databases several national and international databases on non market values of environmental goods and services were reviewed e g nyc green infrastructure co benefits calculator set social and environment tool by mja ciria best benefits of suds tool ecological accounting protocol a tool to calculate the opportunity cost of drainage infrastructure catchment investment analysis tool ciat usgs benefit transfer toolkit https sciencebase usgs gov benefit transfer crc for bushfire and natural hazards value tool database threatened species database environmental valuation reference inventory https www evri ca en splashify splash set social and environment tool by water corporation and envalue it was found that while these databases contain much useful information they do not contain adequate information necessary to evaluate water sensitive projects in australia iftekhar et al 2017 see appendix a for a review of the databases considered during the development of the tool 3 1 3 review of existing tools at first information was collected about available tools for bca or related purposes the following bca tools were reviewed catchment management investment standard detailed guidelines on investment and a tool inffer investment framework for environmental resources the i tree suite of tools awrcoe recycled water economic assessment tool and blackspot funding benefit cost ratio tool pannell 2017 where possible a copy of each tool was obtained and run on microcomputer the main characteristics and key strengths and weaknesses were captured for each tool it was found that the existing bca tools vary widely in their user friendliness structure comprehensiveness and level of support most tend to be focused on a relatively narrow context such as projects for catchments urban trees urban drainage or water recycling each of which has a dedicated bca tool from somewhere in the world there was no existing bca tool that is usable across a broad range of investment types i e all of the above project types and more and is specifically designed for projects with a focus on water sensitive outcomes ciria best is designed to deal with a wide ranging set of benefits that are relevant to water sensitive city projects but it does not provide a full bca inffer is broadly relevant but it is not specifically designed for water sensitive city projects there is incomplete information available about the levels of usage of the various tools but overall stakeholder consultations suggest that most existing tools are used much less than hoped or expected for example the catchment management investment standard and its spreadsheet tool catchment investment analysis tool ciat were commissioned by the water services association of australia but it has had limited usage since see appendix b for a review of the bca tools considered during the development of the tool 3 1 4 stakeholder consultations one to one interviews with a wide range of stakeholders were carried out to understand their needs relevant tool developers and economists experienced in conducting bca were consulted to draw on their experience with developing and applying bca tools 3 1 5 development of the tools based on the feedback from the experts stakeholder consultations literature review review of bca guidelines and review of existing tools beta versions of the tools were developed and shared with more than 50 organizations 3 1 6 training the main developers of the tools provided training workshops in major cities in australia over two years 18 training sessions were conducted plus several webinars on average in each session there were 25 participants from a wide range of organizations utilities local government state government consultants academia and other research bodies the participants were asked to bring their own examples of projects to the training sessions this exercise not only provided hands on training to the participants but also allowed the developers to find bugs and opportunities to improve the tools the first completed version of the tools was released at the beginning of 2020 3 2 a brief description of functionality and different components inffews uses a standard bca framework that is fully consistent with the existing australian government guidelines it includes a benefit cost analysis tool pannell 2020b a value tool providing evidence on non market values iftekhar et al 2020a and extensive documentation to guide their application and decision making processes iftekhar et al 2020b pannell 2020a pannell 2020c pannell 2020d both the bca tool and value tool are spreadsheet based spreadsheet based tools are flexible and adaptable have required level of in built functionality and are familiar to end users olavson and fry 2008 a brief description of the two main components is presented below 3 2 1 the inffews benefit cost analysis bca tool the main purpose of the bca tool is to evaluate compare and rank projects this is done by estimating the net present value npv and benefit cost ratio bcr for each project to apply the tool the user goes through several steps clear definition of the project scenario identification of relevant types of benefits and costs quantification of those benefits and costs and attribution of costs and benefits to different stakeholders fig 2 calculations factor in cooperation with the project by relevant private individuals or businesses or other partner organisations and the risks of project failure results npv and bcr are calculated globally for all of the identified stakeholders and for the project organisation alone 3 2 1 1 definition of the scenarios in the first step the users have to define the with project and without project scenarios the without project scenario is used as the baseline and the difference between the without and with project scenarios guides the estimation of benefits and costs over the lifespan of the analysis the timing of benefits and costs are specified and discounting is used to express all benefits and costs as present values 3 2 1 2 consideration of diverse types of benefits the bca tool explicitly recognises the various types of ways that the benefits of a water sensitive project can be measured it has the capacity to incorporate benefit information in eight different ways 1 benefit per person on average or per household for a particular population 2 benefit per user specified unit 3 benefit per unit of abatement of a pollutant 4 total or aggregate benefit per year 5 delay or reduction in a cost 6 improved condition of an environmental or community asset expressed as a proportional benefit for the asset as a whole 7 reduced probability of a risky event occurring e g a flood and or reduced severity of losses if the risky event does occur and 8 custom benefits specified year by year the bca tool uses these benefit categories to collect the data for the necessary calculations 3 2 1 3 consideration of different types of cost the major categories of costs a water sensitive project could incur are the costs of initial project implementation including cash costs to the funder in kind costs to the lead organisation and private costs to participants ongoing costs to maintain the benefits generated by the project the opportunity cost of the funds invested in the projects which determines the discount rate and the cost of collecting funds through the tax system the excess burden of taxation the tool has full flexibility in terms of consideration of different types of costs 3 2 1 4 attribution of costs and benefits to different stakeholders one of the key features of the bca tool is the allocation of costs and benefits to different stakeholders users are asked to specify the allocation of each cost and benefit item across the affected stakeholders this information is later used to provide stakeholder level analysis of the distribution of benefits and costs 3 2 1 5 consideration of different types of project risks we mentioned above that one potential benefit resulting from a project or policy is a reduction in risk such as a flood event another relevant risk is the risk that the project fails to deliver its benefits there are several types of project risk that may be relevant technical risk socio political risk financial risk and management risk technical risk involves the failure of a project to deliver outcomes due to technical reasons such as natural calamities or engineering failure socio political risk could include community opposition to the project unwillingness of partner agencies to support the project or lack of conducive legal and institutional environment to implement the project financial risk refers to a lack of ongoing funding to maintain the project which is a challenge for many small scale water sensitive projects finally managerial risk could involve issues with poor governance and management of the project the bca tool guides the users to consider all these types of risks explicitly 3 2 1 6 adoption a factor in influencing the delivery of many water sensitive projects is the behaviour of a target group of community members or businesses who would need to adopt new practices for example a project might have a water savings target that relies on people s water conservation or their adoption of rainwater tanks however not everybody in the target group will actually adopt this behaviour benefits are adjusted to reflect judgements about the level of adoption that is realistic this is done by first estimating the benefits assuming full adoption and then scaling down the benefits to reflect judgements about the level of adoption that is realistic 3 2 1 7 outputs from the analysis the main evaluation metrics the bca tool produces are the bcr and npv which indicate whether it is worthwhile to invest in the project these are calculated for all of the identified stakeholders in aggregate and for the project organisation the body responsible for the project stakeholder specific costs and benefits information help in understanding the distributional consequences of a project and adopt appropriate decision rules for example overall results are not necessarily aligned with project organization results table 1 the overall npv might be positive but it might be negative for the project organization this is likely to influence decision making by the project organization or to prompt it to seek funding support from the project beneficiaries in addition to the aggregate results the tool also reports results for each benefit and each cost over time 3 2 1 8 sensitivity analysis and uncertainty the bca tool has an in built capacity that generates comprehensive sensitivity analysis this helps users to assess the impacts of uncertainty about the various inputs users specify simple discrete probability distributions for each benefit type as well as for adoption project risks and costs the tool employs a monte carlo approach conducting 1000 simulations based on random independent draws of the parameter values from the specified distributions based on the simulation results probability distributions are presented for npv and bcr this allows decision makers to assess how robust the results of the bca are in addition the tool calculates a sensitivity index for each benefit item adoption project risk and costs this uses the results of the simulations to indicate which of the factors has the greatest impact on the overall results this helps analysts or decision makers make judgements about which factors should be the main focus for collection of further information it also provides a break even value for each main variable which shows the percentage change in the variable needed to change the overall bcr to 1 together with the probability distributions described above this information helps decision makers to judge the robustness of results the tool also provides two simple sensitivity analyses that are required by some government agencies sensitivity to the discount rate and sensitivity to excluding the excess burden of taxation analysts are requested to record their information sources and are encouraged to submit their draft analysis for expert review the bca tool includes the facility for reviewers to record their comments about each part of the analysis and for analysts to record their responses to those comments the tool also provides the facility for analysts to rate the quality of the information used in the analysis further assisting decision makers to evaluate the analysis they have been given 3 2 1 9 quality assurance the tool provides a comprehensive checklist related to quality assurance of the analysis analysts are asked to enter information on whether and how they have responded to each item on the checklist and this too can be made available to decision makers to help them to make judgements about the quality of the analysis 3 2 1 10 comparing projects a separate spreadsheet is provided that facilitates the process of comparing bca results from different projects results for each project are imported into the comparison tool and decision makers can easily observe how their results vary 3 2 2 the inffews value tool lack of easily accessible information on the non market values of water sensitive projects has been identified as a major constraint to the building of strong business cases for those projects iftekhar et al 2018 iftekhar et al 2019 original non market valuation studies can be expensive and time consuming to carry out and require skills that may not be present in an organization benefit transfer is an established method that guides the extrapolation of the results of existing non market value studies to a new context benefit transfer methods have been applied to evaluate environmental policies in some countries including united states europe and australia newbold et al 2018 however successful application of benefit transfer method requires access to some technical expertise and good quality data iftekhar et al 2021b the value tool assists by collating and synthesising existing non market value information relevant to water sensitive systems and practices in australia the associated guideline provides detailed information about how to apply benefit transfer methods using the information contained in the tool the value tool has been designed to apply two of the most common benefit transfer methods unit value transfer and benefit function transfer boyle et al 2010 each is summarised briefly below 3 2 2 1 unit value transfer unit value transfer involves applying a single or a set of relevant non market value estimates to the project application site johnston et al 2015 if the context of the sites from which the original values were collected match the context of the new site for which the bca is being done then the original estimates could be applied directly such direct transfer of unit values from one site to another is the easiest but the crudest approach more often some adjustment is necessary as the study and application sites do not exactly match various socio economic and biophysical factors can be used to adjust unit values including income age group and the physical condition of the site navrud and ready 2007 the value tool allows the transfer of either adjusted or unadjusted unit values the current version of the tool contains 2 370 non market benefit values or records from 192 australian studies that are related to investment in water sensitive systems and practices eighty eight percent of them are economic estimates that could be directly used for benefit transfer the remaining number of records around 12 contain non economic estimates such as psychological well being measures based on some standard scale reduction in temperature due to green roofs etc which could be used in association with other economic values to estimate the total value of a project the records contained in the value tool have been classified in various ways to facilitate exploration and finding of suitable information one classification that establishes a direct connection between the bca tool and the value tool is based on benefit types the records have been divided into 20 different benefit types the top five benefit types with most records are improved opportunities for recreation 19 ecological improvement and biodiversity 18 improved security for water supply 18 reduced morbidity and improved health 12 and non monetized values 12 fig 3 to assist with the adjusted unit value transfer the tool provides seven types of information on each record iftekhar et al 2020b 1 study identification unique id for records and study citation and the title of the study 2 value classification value location i e where the data has been collected classification of the records according to benefit types theme value types and context 3 marginal change measures type of marginal changes e g consumer surplus implicit price cost etc definition of marginal change i e exactly how the values have been reported unit of measurement e g household person etc frequency of payment e g annual monthly etc adjusted monetary values based on the consumer price index original estimates the year used to adjust the estimates mean or median estimate reported confidence intervals of the estimates reported standard deviation of the original estimate payment method survey year cpi ratios and currency 4 sample characteristics the country of the study the state within which the study was located study location i e where the data has been collected the population of the study site number of respondents response rate sample age percentage of male mean sample income and education level 5 methodology the kind of valuation method used the broad category of method data collection method the number of valid respondents estimation models used 6 publication characteristics the full reference to the study the link to the original source of the study type of publication 7 quality assessment a subjective assessment by the tool developer whether the study was peer reviewed or not subjective assessment of the clarity of the definition of marginal change whether the study clearly specified variability of estimates whether there was sufficient background information on the study site a combined aggregate quality assessment score is reported 3 2 2 2 benefit function transfer non market valuation studies often report statistical models e g regression analysis that could be used to derive a statistical relationship between the non market value of a good or service e g a park and a set of explanatory variables such as the size of the park location of the park distance of houses from the park socio economic status of the local residents etc by applying site specific values for the explanatory variables it is possible to estimate the value of a project there are two main requirements of a benefit function transfer parameterised function from the original study and information about the set of variables in the value tool parametrized functions for selected benefits are given and the users are asked to provide information about relevant variables the value tool contains the following four types of parameterized functions for specific benefits 1 aesthetic benefit of wetlands bushland and golf courses parameterized functions of the relationship between percentage change in the property price with the average distance and size of a wetland bushland and golf courses based on pandit et al 2014 the user enters information on the mean area of the feature e g wetland and the mean distance of houses from it the percentage increase in median property price due to the feature e g wetland is calculated 2 salinity reduction benefit from stormwater management industry this function is based on kandulu et al 2014 the user provides information on the salinity levels for harvested water stormwater alternative sources e g river water and total volume of treated stormwater used in the industry the function calculates the monetary value of the salinity reduction benefits 3 salinity reduction benefit from stormwater management household this function is based on dandy et al 2014 the user provides information on salinity levels for harvested water stormwater alternative sources e g river water and the number of affected households the function calculates the monetary value of the salinity reduction benefits 4 flood damage look up tables these tables provide a relationship between flood depth and damage based on the state of queensland 2018 there are three separate look up tables for three types of damages to the household internal damage structural damage and external damage it also has two separate look up tables for small and medium sized businesses and large businesses the user can identify the monetary estimates of expected damage to different types of houses and businesses due to a flood with a certain depth 3 3 access to and future development of the tools the crc for water sensitive cities has completed its activities as of 2021 water sensitive cities australia wsca has been established to continue the work of the crcwsc both tools are accessible from wsca s website https watersensitivecities org au tools users can download the bca tool for free after registering at the site the value tool is also available for download from the site however access to the value tool requires a subscription fee unless the organization or individual is already a member of the crcwsc wsca five private consultancy farms with economics expertise have been engaged to provide training and support services to potential users of the tools the lead developers iftekhar and pannell of the tools will continue to work with the wsca to provide training engage in consultancy and research projects and update the tools regularly for example an upgrade of the bca tool was released in late 2021 an updated version of the value tool is being planned to be released in 2022 for international applications interested parties are encouraged to contact wsca and or the lead developers 4 applications of inffews the inffews package has been developed and designed to meet the needs of four main groups of users 1 large utilities and government agencies who have in house economic expertise and access to standard bca tools but may lack relevant non market value information 2 local governments and smaller organizations who may not have in house capacity to undertake comprehensive bcas and rely on external consultants to undertake bca work on their behalf 3 consultants who undertake bcas regularly but may lack relevant non market value information and 4 academics and researchers who are interested in the economic assessment of water sensitive systems and practices but may not have access to appropriate tools guidelines and data iftekhar et al 2017 the tool has been shared with more than 132 organizations among them 30 are consulting firms 24 councils 19 government departments and treasuries 14 utilities 10 academic and research organizations and 3 alliances the framework has been reviewed by several organizations and groups such as metropolitan investment and evaluation group victoria nsw treasury nsw public sector cost benefit analysis best practice group sa treasury melbourne water corporation conducted by marsden jacobs associates nsw department of planning industry and environment dpie and sydney water conducted by aurecon group they have been written into guidelines nsw department of planning industry and environment coastal management cba guidelines blacktown city council tender submission guidelines hunter valley tender submission guidelines and city west water position description the tools have been applied to a large number of case studies to evaluate water sensitive projects the examples in table 2 show that the tools have been used to assess and evaluate a wide range of water sensitive features such as rehabilitation of waterways constructed wetlands passive recreation area passive irrigation green roof integrated water management plans alternative water supply water sensitive infill options and water sensitive city planning options comments from users reveal that the tools are serving their intended purpose of facilitating comprehensive economic assessment of water sensitive projects 5 discussion and concluding remarks through our interactions with users of the tools several key reflections and lessons have emerged which could potentially be useful for future tool developers and users in other places it was very important to engage early with the end users to identify and co design the key features and attributes of the tools iftekhar et al 2017 we have followed a systematic stakeholder engagement process guided by a project steering committee consisting of experienced practitioners from different parts of the water industry siebentritt et al 2017 releasing beta versions provided end users with the opportunity to know the tools and trial them before testing them on real world case studies most of the current investment decision support systems used by water utilities and local governments lack the capacity to consider a whole of system views and focus mostly on their own organizational perspective focusing on own organizational perspective is quite acceptable for very well defined projects with a clear demarcation of benefits and costs attributable to a single agency inffews can be easily applied to evaluate such projects however many water sensitive projects do not have such a clear boundary they provide benefits of various types to a number of groups in the community adoption of inffews facilitates the evaluation of such projects as it captures the full range of benefit types and the distributions of costs and benefits i e who pays and who benefits it assists the user of the tools to adopt a holistic thinking process and consider all the possible stakeholders of a project in some organisations investment decisions have relied on cost effectiveness analysis however the adoption of inffews requires a shift from a cost effectiveness approach to a net benefit approach for decision making it places a more rigorous focus on outcomes rectifying one of the common limitations of the existing decision making process in the water sector productivity commission 2020 in the past many water sensitive projects have failed to get funding due to a lack of strong business cases demonstrating the full value of the projects incorporation of the value of intangible benefits i e non market benefits increases the likelihood that overall benefits will outweigh the costs of a water sensitive project the value tool provides curated detailed data on non market values which has made it easier to incorporate such information into the analysis the establishment of an industry standard investment decision framework and tools could increase the efficiency of analysis and decision making in the water sector inffews has reduced the cost of economic data collection and analysis thereby encouraging more bcas of water sensitive projects this will ultimately facilitate the adoption of those water sensitive projects with the greatest net benefits in conclusion many cities and urban areas in australia are going through major transformations due to population growth climate change and increasing demands for natural amenities policy makers and water utilities are facing challenges in meeting growing demands for water for potable agricultural industrial and environmental purposes the inffews package has the potential to meet a key gap in the urban water sector in australia i e a comprehensive evaluation framework and methodology to assess water sensitive projects and policies however the adoption and application of the tools are at an early stage upscaling and wider application of the tools will depend on end users seeing value in them having confidence in their accuracy and acceptability to funding agencies such as departments of treasury and finance

3592,large water resource projects may severely alter hydrological regimes and thus the habitat conditions for biota in wetlands plenty of habitat models for fish vegetation and invertebrates have been developed and widely used however there is a lack of effective models to assess the effects of water resource projects on waterbird habitat in wetlands this study developed a habitat model by integrating two dimensional hydrodynamic multicriteria evaluation cellular automata markov and habitat suitability modules hmh to evaluate the effects of hydraulic structures on the habitat of waterbirds in wetlands the developed hmh model was applied to the duchang provincial nature reserve dpnr of poyang lake in china which is an important conservation wetland in the ramsar convention for demonstration the hmh model analyzed the habitat suitability for grus leucogeranus a rare species in the region with a scheduled sluice under two different regulating rules named rule 1 and rule 2 and compared it to the habitat suitability without the sluice results showed that the sluice operations would increase the water body during dry seasons and thus increase the area of shallow water a preferential habitat to grus leucogeranus the sluice operation in rule 1 would either change the location or remarkably reduced the area of suitable habitat in the northern dpnr the sluice operation in rule 2 would either slightly increase the area or change the location of suitable habitats in the northern dpnr the study demonstrated that the developed method for habitat suitability assessment could provide a viable approach for eco hydrological management of wetlands keywords waterbird habitat model wetlands sluice multicriteria evaluation cellular automata markov 1 introduction dams and sluices are major infrastructure for water resource management but they can also cause adverse effects on established ecosystems bejarano et al 2018 wetlands have long been recognized as kidneys of the earth playing an essential role in water resource conservation and water quality improvement as an important component of global ecosystems wetlands are the main habitats for waterbirds alminagorta et al 2016 goymann et al 2010 meanwhile waterbirds are also important indicator organisms on the health of wetland ecosystems yao et al 2020 however wetland habitats for waterbirds continuously deteriorate due to various disturbances of which the most serious changes in the nature and function of wetland ecosystems are caused by dam and sluice constructions cardador et al 2015 mckenna et al 2017 previous studies have shown that construction of water control structures could seriously alter hydrological regimes and subsequently the habitat conditions for biota in rivers and lakes brennan and dodd 2009 chen et al 2020a jiao 2009 the proposed yangtze to huaihe water diversion project is estimated to cause 60 5 of the mudflats to disappear in caizi lake duo to the rising water level and thus seriously reduce the habitat availability for waterbirds li et al 2019 therefore it is essential to investigate the effects of dam and sluice construction on wetland habitats in recent years a number of models have been developed and widely utilized to assess fish plant and invertebrate habitats muñoz mas et al 2016 yi et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 by combining hydro environmental models and ecological requirements for organisms these models are capable of establishing the quantitative relationship between hydro environmental conditions and the distribution of suitable habitat for specific species in rivers and lakes chen et al 2020b thus these models can be applied to assess the effects of hydraulic structures on aquatic species habitat maddock et al 2016 however the conditions of terrestrial habitat for wetland waterbirds could be largely affected by flow regimes which has not been sufficiently considered in current aquatic habitat models dai et al 2020 in addition the currently available habitat models for waterbirds glad et al 2020 na et al 2015 tang et al 2016 are constructed by superimposing the existing environmental factors e g landscape type vegetation index and topographic condition and thus has limited capacity to assess the impacts of a planned hydraulic structure on habitats cellular automata markov have been widely applied to simulate and predict landscape dynamics guan et al 2011 jokar arsanjani et al 2013 varga et al 2019 getachew et al 2021 while changes in wetland landscapes are affected by multiple factors for instance are largely determined by hydrological regimes bornman et al 2008 yao et al 2020 you et al 2017 cellular automata markov approach alone cannot achieve the prediction of wetland landscape dynamics multicriteria evaluation mce approach that integrates geographic information and decisions has shown great capability to quantify comprehensive effects of multiple factors and is widely used in recent years kumar et al 2013 elaheh and suha 2018 wen et al 2021 getachew et al 2021 the mce could be utilized to produce the land suitability map of cellular automata markov models to quantify the impact of flow regime on the transition of land type getachew et al 2021 therefore there exists great potential to combine cellular automata markov and mce mce cellular automata markov to model landscape changes under multiple impacts by further integrating with a hydrodynamic module it is possible to establish an effective model to assess wetland waterbird habitats under hydrological interferences to achieve the above goal this study combined a two dimensional hydrodynamic module a mce cellular automata markov module and a habitat suitability module so that developed an integrated model hmh to assess habitat conditions for wetland waterbirds the capability of the developed hmh model was demonstrated by evaluating the impacts of a scheduled sluice on the habitat suitability of grus leucogeranus in the duchang provincial nature reserve dpnr of poyang lake china applications of the hmh model are expected to provide suggestions to the conservation of wetlands waterbirds under hydraulic engineering impacts which is essential to wetland water resource management 2 hmh model development 2 1 model variables and framework the selection of proper environmental factors is the first step in developing a model studies on the primary environmental factors influencing the living conditions of wetland waterbirds in winter kwon et al 2011 li et al 2019 tang et al 2016 yao et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 have shown that 1 the land cover represented by landscape type yao et al 2019 tang et al 2016 and 2 the availability of water represented by the distance to a water body are important factors for waterbird habitat for example they are found to be highly correlated with waterfowl species richness carvalho et al 2013 it is also noted that water depth is a determining factor for the habitat of waterbirds li et al 2019 yao et al 2019 the discrimination of deep and shallow water in water body of landscape type can be decided using the suitable habitat water depth of a study waterbird in this way the impact of water depth on waterbirds was included in landscape type besides waterbirds prefer to keep a suitable distance from humans in their selection of habitat de boer et al 2011 yao et al 2019 therefore three groups of major factors including surface condition landscape type water availability water body distance and human disturbance human activity distance were selected in the development of the hmh model fig 1 shows the framework of the proposed hmh model it consists of three main modules the 2d hydrodynamic module the mce cellular automata markov module and the habitat suitability module the main inputs for the hmh model include water level regulation rules of hydraulic structures digital elevation model dem data hydrological data remote sensing rs data and land use data the 2d hydrodynamic module is executed to calculate flow regimes under water level regulations of hydraulic structures the mce cellular automata markov module is then used to predict the landscape type with hydraulic structures based on rs images and the calculated flow regimes similarly the landscape type without hydraulic structure is determined on the basis of rs images geographic information system gis technology is used to calculate water body and human activity distance then the habitat suitability module is used to evaluate the habitat suitability and generate suitability maps for waterbirds with and without hydraulic structures on the basis of the obtained landscape type water body distance human activity distance and the habits preference of the waterbirds finally by comparing the habitat suitability maps the impacts of water resources project on wetland waterbird habitat are quantitatively assessed the details about the 2d hydrodynamic module the mce cellular automata markov module and the waterbird habitat module are elaborated below 2 2 the 2d hydrodynamic module the 2d hydrodynamic numerical model used in this study was the mike 21 fm copenhagen and denmark 2013 which applied a finite volume method and an unstructured triangular mesh to solve the 2d shallow water equations wang et al 2019a yang et al 2019 the governing equations are given as follows equation of mass conservation 1 z t h u x h v y 0 and the equation of momentum conservation 2 u t u u δ x v u δ y g z x g u u 2 v 2 c 2 h v t 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 v t u v δ x

flow velocity in the x and y directions m s respectively z is the water level m g is the gravitational acceleration m s2 c is the chézy coefficient m0 5 s and vt is the turbulent viscosity coefficient m2 s the dem data hydrological data and water level regulation rules of hydraulic structure are used as inputs of the 2d hydrodynamic module 2 3 mce cellular automata markov module the inputs of mce cellular automata markov module mainly require rs image dem data and the simulated flow regime from the 2d hydrodynamic module cellular automata paradigm is a complex dynamic system with discrete time space and state it has been widely used in the allocation simulation of changes in landscape type aliani et al 2019 the state of a cell at time t 1 depends on its state and the state of its neighboring cell at time t the model can be expressed using the following formula 3 s t 1 f s t n where s is the set of the cell state s t and s t 1 are the results of system state at the time of t and t 1 respectively n is the neighborhood range of the cell f is the state transition rule function of the interaction of cell in the neighborhood which is the core of cellular automata model the markov transfer matrix could be considered as the transition rule for cellular automata model which specifies the cell number or probability of landscape type transformation of two time intervals the landscape type of the two time intervals obtained from rs image data is used to generate the transfer matrix of markov probability a traditional method for exploring the quantity of changes in landscape type kamusoko et al 2009 the dynamic evolution of landscape could be considered as the markov process for instance the possible states in markov process could represent landscape types and the state transition probability could represent the amount or proportion of landscape types that transform to other landscapes the process of landscape type change can be expressed using the following formula 4 s t 1 p s t where s t and s t 1 represent the column vector of the landscape type at the time of t and t 1 respectively p is the matrix of transition probability of landscape type and the element pij represents the transition probability from classification i to j 5 p ij a ij j 1 n a ij 100 where aij is the area that classification i is converted to classification j based on the cellular automata markov model and landscape types of two time intervals the landscape type and spatial change in future can be simulated however this model takes insufficient account of irregular changes caused by the water regime in wetland therefore the land suitability map on the basis of mce analysis pramanik 2016 which can include the effect of water regime is regarded as a supplement to the transformation rule the constraint condition boolean standard based on the binarization of constraining conditions is used to restrict the analysis on a specific area and the constraint factor standard that defined the suitability of each cell were two standards for the mce analysis the effects of the elevation and flow regime on the transformation of landscape type in the wetland were analyzed by the mce method using the dem and simulated flow regime from the 2d hydrodynamic module respectively an analytic hierarchy process ahp was used to determine the weight of the various constraint factors of the landscape the weighted linear combination method was used to integrate each factor with its corresponding weight finally the constraint condition was superimposed to obtain the suitability distribution map of each landscape and the map was used as a supplement to the cellular automata state transition rule the following equation was used to calculate the suitability distribution map of a single landscape type 6 s i 1 m x i w i j 1 n c j where s represents the suitability index of a cell xi and wi are the score and the weight of the i th constraint factor respectively cj is the value of the j th constraint condition and m and n are the numbers of constraint factors and constraint conditions respectively the mce cellular automata markov module was implemented in the idrisi 17 0 software sabree ali et al 2020 2 4 habitat suitability module inputs of the habitat suitability module include landscape type water body distance and human activity distance based on the habits of the studied waterbirds the above environmental factors were translated into numerical values by scoring the habitat suitability index hsi method stow et al 2008 which evaluates the preference of a species to the environment by establishing functional relationships between the species and the environmental factors is adopted in the study the following equation was used to calculate the overall hsi of multiple environmental factors 7 hsi i 1 n w i f i where hsi is the overall score of habitat suitability w i and f i are the weight and suitability value of environmental factor i respectively and n is the number of included environmental factors in this study the weight was assessed using the ahp method 3 model application 3 1 study area poyang lake is listed as an important conservation wetland in the ramsar convention ji 2017 and located in jiangxi province china 28 25 n 29 45 n 115 48 e 116 44 e fig 2 the xiu river gang river fu river xin river and rao river feed into the poyang lake from west to east in a counterclockwise direction and the lake drains into the yangtze river at hukou to the north the water level of poyang lake exhibits considerable year round variations wherein the water area can exceed 4000 km2 at the highest summer flood stage in july august and decrease to less than 1000 km2 in dry periods thus exposing rivers channels and small sublakes shankman et al 2006 chen et al 2014 dronova et al 2016 each sublake consists of a shallow lake mudflats and grasslands poyang lake is also the largest habitat for waterbirds wintering in asia and is of global significance in protecting migratory birds of the east asian australasian flyway tang et al 2016 over 300 000 birds including several rare species visit poyang lake every winter ji et al 2007 some rare species include grus leucogeranus ciconia nigra otis tarda pelecanus philippensis platalea leucorodia and cygnus columbianus grus leucogeranus is listed as a critically endangered species by the international union for conservation of nature iucn and the number of these birds overwintering at poyang lake accounts for about 95 of their global population shao et al 2017 two national nature reserves namely poyang lake national nature reserve plnnr and nanjishan national nature reserve njnnr as well as the duchang provincial nature reserve dpnr are established in the main lake area to protect wintering waterbirds in poyang lake however in recent years the ecological status of the lake has deteriorated with early onset and prolonged dry seasons due to the climate change and intense human disturbance liu et al 2016 ye et al 2013 thus the jiangxi government of china has proposed the construction of a sluice at the outlet of the lake to regulate discharge from the lake to the yangtze river in an attempt to improve the wetland however the impact of such a structure on waterbirds habitat has raised great concerns guo et al 2016 lai et al 2017 dpnr is the largest nature reserve 411 km2 in the poyang lake region fig 2 the landform of dpnr is dominated by hills and lakeside plains with a wide water surface and low mountains a total of 230 species of birds including seven species on the china animal protection name list grus leucogeranus is regarded as the representative population have been observed in the wetland ji 2017 since a number of dish shaped sublakes in the whole lake are mainly regulated artificially their hydrological regimes are difficult to be accurately modeled yao et al 2019 therefore this study focused on the dpnr 3 2 model scenarios model scenarios were set on the basis of the water level regulation rules jiangxi provincial water resources department 2016 lai et al 2017 of the scheduled sluice fig 3 three scenarios were analyzed 1 the scenario without the sluice 2 the scenario with the sluice operated by rule 1 and 3 the scenario with the sluice operated by rule 2 in addition the government proposed an ambiguous rule in 2020 however only the lowest regulation water level of 9 5 m was mentioned in this rule therefore the rules of 2013 rule 1 and 2016 rule 2 were finally adopted the overwintering of grus leucogeranus in poyang lake can be divided into three periods hu 2012 as shown in fig 3 the habitat conditions for grus leucogeranus in the middle period december 8th 2010 were mainly analyzed because it was the peak time of overwintering waterbirds here the early november 06th 2010 and late january 25th 2011 overwintering periods of grus leucogeranus were also analyzed to investigate the temporal differences in the impact of the sluice 3 3 datasets table 1 shows the detailed data and their usage in this study the dem and hydrological data were converted into scatter and time series files respectively which were the fundamental inputs of the hydrodynamic model the change of landscape types from the date of october 21th 2010 to the date of november 6th 2010 was used to generate the markov transition probability matrix which is the calibrate time interval due to the similar water level trend with the operating rule of the poyang lake dam fig 3 then the changes from the date of november 6th 2010 to the date of december 8th 2010 were simulated which is the validation time interval similarly the landscape types of the date of january 25th 2011 were simulated on the basis of the landscape type of the date of november 22th 2010 and december 8th 2010 in addition the landscape type of november 6th 2010 without sluice was used as the landscape type of november 6th 2010 with sluice because the water level trend with without the operating rule of the sluice was similar during september 01th 2010 to november 06th 2010 fig 3 the support vector machine of supervised classification method in the envi 5 3 software which can obtain higher classification accuracy puertas et al 2013 was used to classify rs images for obtaining different landscape types according to qi et al 2014 the landscape types in the study area were divided into four classes namely water body soft mud hard mud and meadow on the basis of habit of waterbirds the high resolution images from google earth http earth google com were used to verify the supervised classification results zhu et al 2021 and 500 separate objects were assigned for accuracy assessment the total classification accuracies in this study were above 85 and could be used for later calculations the deep and shallow water was distinguished using a threshold i e 50 cm according to the habits of grus leucogeranus xia et al 2010 liu et al 2011 olsson and rogers 2009 for the situation with no sluice the water surface elevation was extracted with dem data and water bodies and the water depth was calculated by subtracting the dem from the water surface elevation for the situation with the scheduled sluice the water depth was calculated through the 2d hydrodynamic model after sufficient calibration 3 4 model configuration an unstructured mesh was used in the 2d hydrodynamic model of this study the mesh of rivers and dish shaped lakes within the model range was partially encrypted with a maximum element area of 10 000 m2 with the area of the unencrypted region set at about 80 000 m2 the manning coefficient m fig s1 and boundary conditions were set according to our previous study yao et al 2019 fig 4 represents the inflow and outflow boundaries of the model as well as the topographical representation of poyang lake the modeled water levels without a sluice during 2010 2011 were verified using three hydrological stations tangyin xingzi and duchang stations within and around the dpnr two evaluation indices including the average water level error difference between the simulated average water level and the observed average water level and the nash sutcliffe coefficient were adopted in this study nash sutcliffe coefficient is generally utilized to verify the precision of the hydrodynamic or hydrological model result and its value closer to 1 indicates better simulation performance yao et al 2019 after model verification the downstream boundary of the model without the sluice was replaced with the boundary of the scheduled sluice to simulate the flow regimes of the study area under the influence of sluice while all other boundary conditions were kept unchanged water regimes in the lake were calculated in accordance with the designed regulation rules in fig 3 the landscape types of october 21th 2010 and november 6th 2010 were used to generate the markov transition probability matrix table s1 using eqs 3 and 4 and the time interval parameters of the first and second images was set to 1 and the simulated images was set to 2 on the basis of the time interval of the images regard half a month as a cycle constraint factors including the continuous flooding day exposure day and water body distance were chosen on the basis of the relationship between the flow regime and change in the wetland landscape type bornman et al 2008 yao et al 2020 you et al 2017 lampela et al 2016 frei and peiffer 2016 as shown in text 1 in supporting information similarly the dem m was also selected as constraint factor following consideration of the relationship between elevation and landscape type at poyang lake dai et al 2020 you et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 the water body was selected as the constraint condition and the constraint condition was set to the binarized image water body 0 other types 1 the selected constraint factors were provided with various units and scales and thus the fuzzy model was utilized to generate standardized images of the constraint factors range from 0 to 255 the detailed steps were included in the supporting information text 2 the weights of the four factors were equally distributed the weight value of each factor was 0 25 due to the lack of the study on the importance of factors eq 6 was employed to generate the suitability maps fig s2 a c on the basis of the binarized and standardized images finally the combination of the suitability maps and markov transition probability matrix was used as the input of the cellular automata state transition rule the cellular automata markov model was set to a 5 5 filter defaults and the number of cellular automata cycles was set to 2 regard half a month as a cycle on the basis of the time interval of the simulated date december 8th 2010 and initial images date november 6th 2010 the landscapes with the sluice date december 8th 2010 were simulated using eq 5 and the initial landscapes date november 6th 2010 to verify the model the above steps were implemented to predict the landscapes without the sluice date december 8th 2010 and compared with the results with the observations extracted from the rs image of december 8th 2010 the confusion matrix jokar arsanjani et al 2013 was used to verify the simulation accuracy similarly the landscape types with the sluice of the date of january 25th 2011 were obtained shallow water areas with water depth less than 50 cm are mainly preferred by grus leucogeranus in the middle overwintering period liu et al 2011 tang et al 2016 therefore such areas were regarded as the habitat with very high suitability soft mud areas were favorable for the pecking of long beaked waterbirds liu et al 2011 and were regarded as the habitat with high suitability meadow areas could be regarded as the potential habitat for grus leucogeranus in the period burnham et al 2017 hard mud areas could be suitable for the pecking of grus leucogeranus after the moisture replenishment therefore meadow and hard mud areas were regarded as the habitat with moderate suitability table 2 summarized the preferential landscape type by grus leucogeranus in middle overwintering period similarly the preferential landscape types by grus leucogeranu in early and late overwintering periods are given in table s1 see hu 2012 the suitable types of water availability were classified on the basis of natural breaks method vehicles ships and construction activities were the main human disturbances in poyang lake and wang et al 2019b indicated the main factors affecting the habitat selection of cranes was the distance to settlement thus the distance to settlement road and dam were selected to characterize the human interference the higher the administrative level of a settlement the stronger human activity is imposed according to the previous study zhang 2016 the distance thresholds of suitable types in disturbance for grus leucogeranus were classified table 2 the ahp was used to determinate the weights of environmental factors the detailed steps of ahp and sensitivity analysis were included in text 3 in supporting information table 2 shows the weights determined by ahp and classification of the selected factors for the habitat suitability the human activity and the water body distances were calculated from the land use data and landscape type i e water body respectively waterbird habitat suitability for poyang lake was assessed by overlaying the factor layers in the arcgis 10 2 software anlauf et al 2018 these data layers were translated into numerical data prior to calculation of the hsi and all data were standardized by eq 8 finally the values of hsi were calculated using eq 7 waterbird habitat suitability was graded as very high 0 75 1 high 0 5 0 75 moderate 0 25 0 5 or poor 0 0 25 on the basis of the value of hsi tang et al 2016 8 f x x min x max x min where f is the normalized factor value x is the score of a factor and xmax and xmin are the minimum and maximum scores of the factor respectively 3 5 model results 3 5 1 validation of the 2d hydrodynamic module fig 5 shows the comparison between the observed and the simulated water levels from 2010 to 2011 at three hydrological stations tangyin xingzi and duchang stations around the dpnr in this study the simulated water levels at all three stations during 2010 2011 are in agreement with the observations the values of the averaged error and the nash sutcliffe coefficient were 0 1 m and 0 975 respectively for the tangyin station 0 2 m and 0 990 respectively for the xingzi station and 0 2 m and 0 992 respectively for duchang station overall the hydrodynamic modeling had sufficient precision and could be used for later calculations 3 5 2 validation of the mce cellular automata markov module fig 6 shows the mce cellular automata markov prediction map without the sluice and the real landscape type map from the rs image on 08 december 2010 table 3 shows the statistic results of the mce cellular automata markov prediction and the rs landscape type maps the predicted and the real landscape types were consistent for 08 december 2010 in various landscapes the simulation accuracy of water body was the best 96 5 and the simulation accuracy of soft mud was the worst 75 64 the total accuracy was 0 83 indicating that the mce cellular automata markov model established in this study had acceptable performance 3 5 3 performance of the hmh model in the middle overwintering period fig 7 a shows the spatial distribution of water body distance with and without sluice in the middle overwintering period table 4 shows the area and the proportion statistic of water body distance for grus leucogeranus the area with the very high suitability occupied 218 12 km2 accounting for 53 07 of the total study area table 4 whereas the area with the poor suitability comprised 45 99 km2 which equates to 11 19 of the total study area following sluice operation the areas with the very high suitability increased remarkably by 33 02 and 24 05 for rules 1 and 2 respectively compared with the original condition table 4 the area with water body distance greater than 1500 m still comprised the smallest portion which was 3 17 and 5 12 of the total study area for rules 1 and 2 respectively fig 7b shows the spatial distribution of landscape type with and without the sluice in the middle overwintering period table 5 shows the statistics for area and the proportion of landscape type for grus leucogeranus in the middle overwintering period in terms of the landscape type without employing the sluice hard mud occupied the largest area 155 43 km2 accounting for 37 82 of the total study area table 5 and deep water comprised the smallest area 20 22 km2 comprising 4 92 of the total study area in terms of the landscape type following sluice operation the soft and hard muds in the landscape type without the sluice were covered with shallow and deep water in rule 1 the deep water occupied the largest area 156 07 km2 which accounted for 37 97 of the total study area and a 33 05 increase compared with the landscape type without the sluice table 5 in contrast the hard mud comprised the smallest area 45 12 km2 making up 10 98 of the total study area and amounting to a 26 84 decrease compared with the landscape type without the sluice in rule 2 the meadow occupied the largest area 111 76 km2 which accounted for 27 19 of the total study area and a 1 29 increase compared with the landscape type without the sluice table 5 in comparison the soft mud comprised the smallest area 50 91 km2 which accounted for 12 39 of the total study area and a 4 25 decrease compared with the landscape type without the sluice fig 7c shows the spatial distribution of superimposed human activity distance with and without the sluice the distance maps for human activities were generated by superimposing all human activity factors in table 2 in this case study the spatial distribution of superimposed human activity distance from highways or rural township and county and city settlements produced no differences in scenarios with or without employment of the sluice this was mainly because the sluice operation would not change the locations of human activity related factors in addition the direct effects from sluice operations for example the noise from engines are negligible because the location of the sluice is more than 1200 m away from the reserve area fig 2 therefore the habitat suitability with regards to human activity disturbance with the planed sluice was the same as that without the sluice fig 8 shows the spatial feature of the habitat suitability without the sluice and with the sluice operation in rules 1 and 2 of the middle overwintering period table 6 shows the area and the proportion statistics of the habitat suitability for grus leucogeranus in the middle overwintering period in terms of the suitability without the sluice the suitable habitat area with very high and high suitability 214 83 km2 was evenly distributed in the southern and northern dpnr which accounted for 52 27 of the total study area table 6 the places with moderate suitability occupied the largest area 126 79 km2 which accounted for 30 85 of the total study area table 6 in addition the uncertainty analysis of habitat suitability was performed fig s6 on the basis of the sensitivity analysis of ahp the weight exerted a certain effect on the suitable habitat area but the law remained unchanged fig s6 the suitable habitat area of rule 1 was smaller than the areas of rule 2 and no sluice in terms of the suitability under the sluice operation in rule 1 the suitable habitat remained in the southern dpnr covering an area of 176 32 km2 this area accounted for 42 9 of the total study area representing a 9 37 decrease compared with the habitat without the sluice table 6 however the area with moderate suitability increased substantially in the northern dpnr this result was due to the water storage by the sluice which increased the area of water body but replaced the shallow water and mud with deep water causing a reduction in grus leucogeranus habitat the places with moderate suitability still occupied the largest area 201 72 km2 which accounted for 49 08 of the total study area suitability conditions following sluice operation in rule 2 showed that the suitable habitat 214 99 km2 remained in the southern and northern dpnr which accounted for 52 31 of the total study area essentially equal to the habitat without the sluice and a 9 41 increase compared with the habitat under the sluice operation in rule 1 table 6 however the location of suitable habitat moved southward in the northern dpnr this result was due to water storage by the sluice with suitable water level which increased the area of water body and replaced the hard mud with shallow water bringing benefits to grus leucogeranus habitation the area with moderate suitability still occupied the largest area 163 66 km2 which accounted for 39 82 of the total study area 3 5 4 performance of the hmh model in the start and lateness of the overwintering period fig 9 shows the spatial feature of the habitat suitability in the start and lateness of the overwintering period table 7 shows the area and the proportion statistics of the habitat suitability for grus leucogeranus in terms of the suitability in the start of overwintering period the suitable habitat 247 07 km2 was evenly distributed in the southern and northern dpnr accounting for 60 12 of the total study area table 7 the places with moderate suitability occupied the largest area 148 81 km2 accounting for 36 21 of the total study area table 6 the scheduled sluice had little impact on dpnr during this period due to the similar water level process with no sluice in late wintering period a large amount of soft mud is transformed into hard mud and meadow figs 7 and s5 and the suitable habitat 20 96 for g leucogeranus reduced significantly the sluice operation would change the location of the suitable habitat fig 9 due to the spatial shift of shallow water in the northern dpnr fig s5 meanwhile the suitable habitat 25 51 in the dpnr would be slightly increased under the sluice operation in rule 2 implying positive effect of the sluice on the habitat of g leucogeranus in the late overwintering period 4 discussion 4 1 significance of hydrological regime on waterbird habitat suitability hydrological regimes are the main driving factors of wetland ecological processes d odorico et al 2010 silvertown et al 1999 the feeding places migration behavior and spatial distribution of grus leucogeranus are highly dependent on the seasonal water level fluctuations liu et al 2011 xia et al 2010 have reported that water level is negatively related to habitat suitability for waterbirds at poyang lake due to the threshold water depth for living for example the maximum water depth for foraging of grus leucogeranus and cygnus columbianus is about 50 and 70 cm respectively xia et al 2010 the water level of the poyang lake was high at the beginning of the overwintering period about november to december of grus leucogeranus making mud and meadow with high elevations the main habitat as the water level gradually dropped in the middle period december to the january of following year the water depth of plnnr reached suitable condition for grus leucogeranus about 50 cm and the shallow water became the main habitat of grus leucogeranus the water level of plnnr gradually dropped down in late winter the january to march of following year then grus leucogeranus moved to the mud and shallow water of main lake near the dpnr hu 2012 in general the hydrological and hydrodynamic models were mainly applied to simulate the hydrological regimes in large seasonally flooded wetland because they can capture the water level process of dry wet alternation well yao et al 2020 yu et al 2020 however the hydrological model is not suitable for modelling the scenario with a planned hydraulic structure due to the backwater of the hydraulic structure neitsch et al 2011 therefore a 2d hydrodynamic model was used in this study to overcome this deficiency the hydrodynamic model could accurately simulate the hydrological regimes of poyang lake wetland with without the sluice demonstrating the superiority for hydrological regimes simulation in large seasonally flooded wetland it is noticed that the simulation results of the hydrodynamic model had relatively high error in dry season and the maximum deviation between simulated and observed water level reached about 0 5 m this may result in more water bodies and longer inundation days and thus affect the prediction of landscape type in mce cellular automata markov module the major reason is that the water surface of the studied area is largely disconnected due to low water level in dry season forming a number of scattered dish shaped small water bodies sublakes and such dynamic process is difficult to be accurately captured in hydrodynamic model yao et al 2019 however the problem can be remediated by obtaining more spatially intensive hydrological observation data to calibrate the hydrodynamic model the study could help decision makers to compare the effects of different water level dispatching plans and provide an effective reference for eco hydrological management of the wetlands 4 2 applicability of hmh model for waterbird habitat suitability evaluation some researchers have tried to use rs technology and the generalized linear model to evaluate the effects of hydraulic structures on habitats for waterbirds guan et al 2016 li et al 2019 however due to the limitations of rs observation in space and time this method has large uncertainties and is incapable of performing the multi scene simulation chen et al 2020b and yao et al 2019 attempted to establish a method to evaluate waterbird habitat using a single hydrodynamic model but they have not included waterbird habitat outside specific water bodies i e meadow mud etc this study developed an effective hmh model that could be used to predict the effect of a hydraulic structure on the complete habitat for waterbirds and assist in modelling wetland eco hydrological conditions the developed hmh model considered the impact of hydrological processes on the habitat in the mce cellular automata markov module which could provide a way to estimate ecological flows the minimum water flow to maintain the ecological balance for downstream biota for waterbirds through simulations of different scenarios the model could be used to assess the habitats for other waterbirds by adjusting the preferred habitat and threshold of deep and shallow water for example the habitat for tundra swan cygnus columbianus could be assessed by regarding mud and shallow water as the most suitable habitat and using 80 cm as the threshold for deep shallow water in habitat suitability module tang et al 2016 the model can also be extended to other regions for instance the everglades usa where wetlands are restored by building gates at the lake entrance brennan and dodd 2009 the habitat suitability of waterbird after gate construction can be evaluated by changing the inflow at the lake entrance in the hydrodynamic model according to the proposed operation plan 4 3 limitations and future studies in this study landscape type was used to characterize the preferred habitat of grus leucogeranus in its overwintering period dry season however food availability plays an important role in habitat preference the main food for grus leucogeranus is submerged vegetation which is mainly affected by the hydrological process in wet season chen et al 2020b therefore the relationship between hydrological processes in wet season and submerged vegetation should be considered in future modeling processes in addition the natural interval method which has been widely used to classify the suitability of environmental factor when relevant data is insufficient dong et al 2013 tang et al 2016 was adopted to classify the water body distance in this study in future the classification of water body distance should be based on detailed investigations of the relationship between water distance and distribution of grus leucogeranus the direct and indirect impacts of the sluice on the human activity distance was neglected in this study because the location of the sluice is far away from dpnr and the sluice operation would not change the locations of human activities however construction of water resource projects sometimes lead to human relocation due to land inundation tan and yao 2006 mavhura et al 2017 or uncomfortable noises from high flow discharge and machine operations lian et al 2017 celi et al 2016 these can directly or indirectly cause human activity impacts on the habitats of waterbirds the developed model holds the capability to assess these impacts incurred by human activities although they were neglected in this case study 5 conclusions an integrated habitat model which combines a hydrodynamic module a multicriteria evaluation cellular automata markov module and a habitat suitability module hmh was developed to assess the effects of sluice on the overwintering habitat of waterbirds the model was applied to poyang lake the largest wintering habitat for waterbirds in asia the impacts of the poyang lake sluice on the habitat suitability for grus leucogeranus in the dpnr were evaluated results showed that the sluice increased the capacity of water body during the dry season and exerted little effect on the habitats in the early overwintering period but remarkably affected reduced improved area or changed location the suitable habitats for grus leucogeranus in the northern dpnr during the middle and late overwintering periods in the middle overwintering period the sluice operation in rule 1 proposed by jiangxi provincial water resources department in 2013 decreased the proportions of suitable habitats compared with no sluice the sluice operation in rule 2 proposed by jiangxi provincial water resources department in 2016 had no remarkable influence on the suitable habitat area for grus leucogeranus but the location of the suitable habitat in the northern dpnr moved southward in the late overwintering period the location of the suitable habitat in the northern dpnr moved southward under the sluice operation and the sluice operation in rule 2 increased the proportions of suitable habitats compared with no sluice the developed hmh model which considers the impact of hydrological processes on waterbird habitat in the mce cellular automata markov module could make up for the deficit in the traditional aquatic habitat model that results in an inadequate assessment of the impacts of water resources projects on waterbird habitat due to the intermittent use of terrestrial habitats by waterbirds furthermore the hmh model could also provide an effective way to estimate ecological flows for waterbirds through the simulation of different scenarios the established new approach provides a viable way to assess the ecological impacts of water resource projects on wetlands and can be easily transferred to other similar studies credit authorship

3592,large water resource projects may severely alter hydrological regimes and thus the habitat conditions for biota in wetlands plenty of habitat models for fish vegetation and invertebrates have been developed and widely used however there is a lack of effective models to assess the effects of water resource projects on waterbird habitat in wetlands this study developed a habitat model by integrating two dimensional hydrodynamic multicriteria evaluation cellular automata markov and habitat suitability modules hmh to evaluate the effects of hydraulic structures on the habitat of waterbirds in wetlands the developed hmh model was applied to the duchang provincial nature reserve dpnr of poyang lake in china which is an important conservation wetland in the ramsar convention for demonstration the hmh model analyzed the habitat suitability for grus leucogeranus a rare species in the region with a scheduled sluice under two different regulating rules named rule 1 and rule 2 and compared it to the habitat suitability without the sluice results showed that the sluice operations would increase the water body during dry seasons and thus increase the area of shallow water a preferential habitat to grus leucogeranus the sluice operation in rule 1 would either change the location or remarkably reduced the area of suitable habitat in the northern dpnr the sluice operation in rule 2 would either slightly increase the area or change the location of suitable habitats in the northern dpnr the study demonstrated that the developed method for habitat suitability assessment could provide a viable approach for eco hydrological management of wetlands keywords waterbird habitat model wetlands sluice multicriteria evaluation cellular automata markov 1 introduction dams and sluices are major infrastructure for water resource management but they can also cause adverse effects on established ecosystems bejarano et al 2018 wetlands have long been recognized as kidneys of the earth playing an essential role in water resource conservation and water quality improvement as an important component of global ecosystems wetlands are the main habitats for waterbirds alminagorta et al 2016 goymann et al 2010 meanwhile waterbirds are also important indicator organisms on the health of wetland ecosystems yao et al 2020 however wetland habitats for waterbirds continuously deteriorate due to various disturbances of which the most serious changes in the nature and function of wetland ecosystems are caused by dam and sluice constructions cardador et al 2015 mckenna et al 2017 previous studies have shown that construction of water control structures could seriously alter hydrological regimes and subsequently the habitat conditions for biota in rivers and lakes brennan and dodd 2009 chen et al 2020a jiao 2009 the proposed yangtze to huaihe water diversion project is estimated to cause 60 5 of the mudflats to disappear in caizi lake duo to the rising water level and thus seriously reduce the habitat availability for waterbirds li et al 2019 therefore it is essential to investigate the effects of dam and sluice construction on wetland habitats in recent years a number of models have been developed and widely utilized to assess fish plant and invertebrate habitats muñoz mas et al 2016 yi et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 by combining hydro environmental models and ecological requirements for organisms these models are capable of establishing the quantitative relationship between hydro environmental conditions and the distribution of suitable habitat for specific species in rivers and lakes chen et al 2020b thus these models can be applied to assess the effects of hydraulic structures on aquatic species habitat maddock et al 2016 however the conditions of terrestrial habitat for wetland waterbirds could be largely affected by flow regimes which has not been sufficiently considered in current aquatic habitat models dai et al 2020 in addition the currently available habitat models for waterbirds glad et al 2020 na et al 2015 tang et al 2016 are constructed by superimposing the existing environmental factors e g landscape type vegetation index and topographic condition and thus has limited capacity to assess the impacts of a planned hydraulic structure on habitats cellular automata markov have been widely applied to simulate and predict landscape dynamics guan et al 2011 jokar arsanjani et al 2013 varga et al 2019 getachew et al 2021 while changes in wetland landscapes are affected by multiple factors for instance are largely determined by hydrological regimes bornman et al 2008 yao et al 2020 you et al 2017 cellular automata markov approach alone cannot achieve the prediction of wetland landscape dynamics multicriteria evaluation mce approach that integrates geographic information and decisions has shown great capability to quantify comprehensive effects of multiple factors and is widely used in recent years kumar et al 2013 elaheh and suha 2018 wen et al 2021 getachew et al 2021 the mce could be utilized to produce the land suitability map of cellular automata markov models to quantify the impact of flow regime on the transition of land type getachew et al 2021 therefore there exists great potential to combine cellular automata markov and mce mce cellular automata markov to model landscape changes under multiple impacts by further integrating with a hydrodynamic module it is possible to establish an effective model to assess wetland waterbird habitats under hydrological interferences to achieve the above goal this study combined a two dimensional hydrodynamic module a mce cellular automata markov module and a habitat suitability module so that developed an integrated model hmh to assess habitat conditions for wetland waterbirds the capability of the developed hmh model was demonstrated by evaluating the impacts of a scheduled sluice on the habitat suitability of grus leucogeranus in the duchang provincial nature reserve dpnr of poyang lake china applications of the hmh model are expected to provide suggestions to the conservation of wetlands waterbirds under hydraulic engineering impacts which is essential to wetland water resource management 2 hmh model development 2 1 model variables and framework the selection of proper environmental factors is the first step in developing a model studies on the primary environmental factors influencing the living conditions of wetland waterbirds in winter kwon et al 2011 li et al 2019 tang et al 2016 yao et al 2019 zhang et al 2014 have shown that 1 the land cover represented by landscape type yao et al 2019 tang et al 2016 and 2 the availability of water represented by the distance to a water body are important factors for waterbird habitat for example they are found to be highly correlated with waterfowl species richness carvalho et al 2013 it is also noted that water depth is a determining factor for the habitat of waterbirds li et al 2019 yao et al 2019 the discrimination of deep and shallow water in water body of landscape type can be decided using the suitable habitat water depth of a study waterbird in this way the impact of water depth on waterbirds was included in landscape type besides waterbirds prefer to keep a suitable distance from humans in their selection of habitat de boer et al 2011 yao et al 2019 therefore three groups of major factors including surface condition landscape type water availability water body distance and human disturbance human activity distance were selected in the development of the hmh model fig 1 shows the framework of the proposed hmh model it consists of three main modules the 2d hydrodynamic module the mce cellular automata markov module and the habitat suitability module the main inputs for the hmh model include water level regulation rules of hydraulic structures digital elevation model dem data hydrological data remote sensing rs data and land use data the 2d hydrodynamic module is executed to calculate flow regimes under water level regulations of hydraulic structures the mce cellular automata markov module is then used to predict the landscape type with hydraulic structures based on rs images and the calculated flow regimes similarly the landscape type without hydraulic structure is determined on the basis of rs images geographic information system gis technology is used to calculate water body and human activity distance then the habitat suitability module is used to evaluate the habitat suitability and generate suitability maps for waterbirds with and without hydraulic structures on the basis of the obtained landscape type water body distance human activity distance and the habits preference of the waterbirds finally by comparing the habitat suitability maps the impacts of water resources project on wetland waterbird habitat are quantitatively assessed the details about the 2d hydrodynamic module the mce cellular automata markov module and the waterbird habitat module are elaborated below 2 2 the 2d hydrodynamic module the 2d hydrodynamic numerical model used in this study was the mike 21 fm copenhagen and denmark 2013 which applied a finite volume method and an unstructured triangular mesh to solve the 2d shallow water equations wang et al 2019a yang et al 2019 the governing equations are given as follows equation of mass conservation 1 z t h u x h v y 0 and the equation of momentum conservation 2 u t u u δ x v u δ y g z x g u u 2 v 2 c 2 h v t 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 v t u v δ x v v δ y g z y g v u 2 v 2 c 2 h v t 2 v x 2 2 v y 2 where h is the water depth m s u and v are the flow velocities in the x and y directions m s respectively u and v are the components of the average flow velocity in the x and y directions m s respectively z is the water level m g is the gravitational acceleration m s2 c is the chézy coefficient m0 5 s and vt is the turbulent viscosity coefficient m2 s the dem data hydrological data and water level regulation rules of hydraulic structure are used as inputs of the 2d hydrodynamic module 2 3 mce cellular automata markov module the inputs of mce cellular automata markov module mainly require rs image dem data and the simulated flow regime from the 2d hydrodynamic module cellular automata paradigm is a complex dynamic system with discrete time space and state it has been widely used in the allocation simulation of changes in landscape type aliani et al 2019 the state of a cell at time t 1 depends on its state and the state of its neighboring cell at time t the model can be expressed using the following formula 3 s t 1 f s t n where s is the set of the cell state s t and s t 1 are the results of system state at the time of t and t 1 respectively n is the neighborhood range of the cell f is the state transition rule function of the interaction of cell in the neighborhood which is the core of cellular automata model the markov transfer matrix could be considered as the transition rule for cellular automata model which specifies the cell number or probability of landscape type transformation of two time intervals the landscape type of the two time intervals obtained from rs image data is used to generate the transfer matrix of markov probability a traditional method for exploring the quantity of changes in landscape type kamusoko et al 2009 the dynamic evolution of landscape could be considered as the markov process for instance the possible states in markov process could represent landscape types and the state transition probability could represent the amount or proportion of landscape types that transform to other landscapes the process of landscape type change can be expressed using the following formula 4 s t 1 p s t where s t and s t 1 represent the column vector of the landscape type at the time of t and t 1 respectively p is the matrix of transition probability of landscape type and the element pij represents the transition probability from classification i to j 5 p ij a ij j 1 n a ij 100 where aij is the area that classification i is converted to classification j based on the cellular automata markov model and landscape types of two time intervals the landscape type and spatial change in future can be simulated however this model takes insufficient account of irregular changes caused by the water regime in wetland therefore the land suitability map on the basis of mce analysis pramanik 2016 which can include the effect of water regime is regarded as a supplement to the transformation rule the constraint condition boolean standard based on the binarization of constraining conditions is used to restrict the analysis on a specific area and the constraint factor standard that defined the suitability of each cell were two standards for the mce analysis the effects of the elevation and flow regime on the transformation of landscape type in the wetland were analyzed by the mce method using the dem and simulated flow regime from the 2d hydrodynamic module respectively an analytic hierarchy process ahp was used to determine the weight of the various constraint factors of the landscape the weighted linear combination method was used to integrate each factor with its corresponding weight finally the constraint condition was superimposed to obtain the suitability distribution map of each landscape and the map was used as a supplement to the cellular automata state transition rule the following equation was used to calculate the suitability distribution map of a single landscape type 6 s i 1 m x i w i j 1 n c j where s represents the suitability index of a cell xi and wi are the score and the weight of the i th constraint factor respectively cj is the value of the j th constraint condition and m and n are the numbers of constraint factors and constraint conditions respectively the mce cellular automata markov module was implemented in the idrisi 17 0 software sabree ali et al 2020 2 4 habitat suitability module inputs of the habitat suitability module include landscape type water body distance and human activity distance based on the habits of the studied waterbirds the above environmental factors were translated into numerical values by scoring the habitat suitability index hsi method stow et al 2008 which evaluates the preference of a species to the environment by establishing functional relationships between the species and the environmental factors is adopted in the study the following equation was used to calculate the overall hsi of multiple environmental factors 7 hsi i 1 n w i f i where hsi is the overall score of habitat suitability w i and f i are the weight and suitability value of environmental factor i respectively and n is the number of included environmental factors in this study the weight was assessed using the ahp method 3 model application 3 1 study area poyang lake is listed as an important conservation wetland in the ramsar convention ji 2017 and located in jiangxi province china 28 25 n 29 45 n 115 48 e 116 44 e fig 2 the xiu river gang river fu river xin river and rao river feed into the poyang lake from west to east in a counterclockwise direction and the lake drains into the yangtze river at hukou to the north the water level of poyang lake exhibits considerable year round variations wherein the water area can exceed 4000 km2 at the highest summer flood stage in july august and decrease to less than 1000 km2 in dry periods thus exposing rivers channels and small sublakes shankman et al 2006 chen et al 2014 dronova et al 2016 each sublake consists of a shallow lake mudflats and grasslands poyang lake is also the largest habitat for waterbirds wintering in asia and is of global significance in protecting migratory birds of the east asian australasian flyway tang et al 2016 over 300 000 birds including several rare species visit poyang lake every winter ji et al 2007 some rare species include grus leucogeranus ciconia nigra otis tarda pelecanus philippensis platalea leucorodia and cygnus columbianus grus leucogeranus is listed as a critically endangered species by the international union for conservation of nature iucn and the number of these birds overwintering at poyang lake accounts for about 95 of their global population shao et al 2017 two national nature reserves namely poyang lake national nature reserve plnnr and nanjishan national nature reserve njnnr as well as the duchang provincial nature reserve dpnr are established in the main lake area to protect wintering waterbirds in poyang lake however in recent years the ecological status of the lake has deteriorated with early onset and prolonged dry seasons due to the climate change and intense human disturbance liu et al 2016 ye et al 2013 thus the jiangxi government of china has proposed the construction of a sluice at the outlet of the lake to regulate discharge from the lake to the yangtze river in an attempt to improve the wetland however the impact of such a structure on waterbirds habitat has raised great concerns guo et al 2016 lai et al 2017 dpnr is the largest nature reserve 411 km2 in the poyang lake region fig 2 the landform of dpnr is dominated by hills and lakeside plains with a wide water surface and low mountains a total of 230 species of birds including seven species on the china animal protection name list grus leucogeranus is regarded as the representative population have been observed in the wetland ji 2017 since a number of dish shaped sublakes in the whole lake are mainly regulated artificially their hydrological regimes are difficult to be accurately modeled yao et al 2019 therefore this study focused on the dpnr 3 2 model scenarios model scenarios were set on the basis of the water level regulation rules jiangxi provincial water resources department 2016 lai et al 2017 of the scheduled sluice fig 3 three scenarios were analyzed 1 the scenario without the sluice 2 the scenario with the sluice operated by rule 1 and 3 the scenario with the sluice operated by rule 2 in addition the government proposed an ambiguous rule in 2020 however only the lowest regulation water level of 9 5 m was mentioned in this rule therefore the rules of 2013 rule 1 and 2016 rule 2 were finally adopted the overwintering of grus leucogeranus in poyang lake can be divided into three periods hu 2012 as shown in fig 3 the habitat conditions for grus leucogeranus in the middle period december 8th 2010 were mainly analyzed because it was the peak time of overwintering waterbirds here the early november 06th 2010 and late january 25th 2011 overwintering periods of grus leucogeranus were also analyzed to investigate the temporal differences in the impact of the sluice 3 3 datasets table 1 shows the detailed data and their usage in this study the dem and hydrological data were converted into scatter and time series files respectively which were the fundamental inputs of the hydrodynamic model the change of landscape types from the date of october 21th 2010 to the date of november 6th 2010 was used to generate the markov transition probability matrix which is the calibrate time interval due to the similar water level trend with the operating rule of the poyang lake dam fig 3 then the changes from the date of november 6th 2010 to the date of december 8th 2010 were simulated which is the validation time interval similarly the landscape types of the date of january 25th 2011 were simulated on the basis of the landscape type of the date of november 22th 2010 and december 8th 2010 in addition the landscape type of november 6th 2010 without sluice was used as the landscape type of november 6th 2010 with sluice because the water level trend with without the operating rule of the sluice was similar during september 01th 2010 to november 06th 2010 fig 3 the support vector machine of supervised classification method in the envi 5 3 software which can obtain higher classification accuracy puertas et al 2013 was used to classify rs images for obtaining different landscape types according to qi et al 2014 the landscape types in the study area were divided into four classes namely water body soft mud hard mud and meadow on the basis of habit of waterbirds the high resolution images from google earth http earth google com were used to verify the supervised classification results zhu et al 2021 and 500 separate objects were assigned for accuracy assessment the total classification accuracies in this study were above 85 and could be used for later calculations the deep and shallow water was distinguished using a threshold i e 50 cm according to the habits of grus leucogeranus xia et al 2010 liu et al 2011 olsson and rogers 2009 for the situation with no sluice the water surface elevation was extracted with dem data and water bodies and the water depth was calculated by subtracting the dem from the water surface elevation for the situation with the scheduled sluice the water depth was calculated through the 2d hydrodynamic model after sufficient calibration 3 4 model configuration an unstructured mesh was used in the 2d hydrodynamic model of this study the mesh of rivers and dish shaped lakes within the model range was partially encrypted with a maximum element area of 10 000 m2 with the area of the unencrypted region set at about 80 000 m2 the manning coefficient m fig s1 and boundary conditions were set according to our previous study yao et al 2019 fig 4 represents the inflow and outflow boundaries of the model as well as the topographical representation of poyang lake the modeled water levels without a sluice during 2010 2011 were verified using three hydrological stations tangyin xingzi and duchang stations within and around the dpnr two evaluation indices including the average water level error difference between the simulated average water level and the observed average water level and the nash sutcliffe coefficient were adopted in this study nash sutcliffe coefficient is generally utilized to verify the precision of the hydrodynamic or hydrological model result and its value closer to 1 indicates better simulation performance yao et al 2019 after model verification the downstream boundary of the model without the sluice was replaced with the boundary of the scheduled sluice to simulate the flow regimes of the study area under the influence of sluice while all other boundary conditions were kept unchanged water regimes in the lake were calculated in accordance with the designed regulation rules in fig 3 the landscape types of october 21th 2010 and november 6th 2010 were used to generate the markov transition probability matrix table s1 using eqs 3 and 4 and the time interval parameters of the first and second images was set to 1 and the simulated images was set to 2 on the basis of the time interval of the images regard half a month as a cycle constraint factors including the continuous flooding day exposure day and water body distance were chosen on the basis of the relationship between the flow regime and change in the wetland landscape type bornman et al 2008 yao et al 2020 you et al 2017 lampela et al 2016 frei and peiffer 2016 as shown in text 1 in supporting information similarly the dem m was also selected as constraint factor following consideration of the relationship between elevation and landscape type at poyang lake dai et al 2020 you et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 the water body was selected as the constraint condition and the constraint condition was set to the binarized image water body 0 other types 1 the selected constraint factors were provided with various units and scales and thus the fuzzy model was utilized to generate standardized images of the constraint factors range from 0 to 255 the detailed steps were included in the supporting information text 2 the weights of the four factors were equally distributed the weight value of each factor was 0 25 due to the lack of the study on the importance of factors eq 6 was employed to generate the suitability maps fig s2 a c on the basis of the binarized and standardized images finally the combination of the suitability maps and markov transition probability matrix was used as the input of the cellular automata state transition rule the cellular automata markov model was set to a 5 5 filter defaults and the number of cellular automata cycles was set to 2 regard half a month as a cycle on the basis of the time interval of the simulated date december 8th 2010 and initial images date november 6th 2010 the landscapes with the sluice date december 8th 2010 were simulated using eq 5 and the initial landscapes date november 6th 2010 to verify the model the above steps were implemented to predict the landscapes without the sluice date december 8th 2010 and compared with the results with the observations extracted from the rs image of december 8th 2010 the confusion matrix jokar arsanjani et al 2013 was used to verify the simulation accuracy similarly the landscape types with the sluice of the date of january 25th 2011 were obtained shallow water areas with water depth less than 50 cm are mainly preferred by grus leucogeranus in the middle overwintering period liu et al 2011 tang et al 2016 therefore such areas were regarded as the habitat with very high suitability soft mud areas were favorable for the pecking of long beaked waterbirds liu et al 2011 and were regarded as the habitat with high suitability meadow areas could be regarded as the potential habitat for grus leucogeranus in the period burnham et al 2017 hard mud areas could be suitable for the pecking of grus leucogeranus after the moisture replenishment therefore meadow and hard mud areas were regarded as the habitat with moderate suitability table 2 summarized the preferential landscape type by grus leucogeranus in middle overwintering period similarly the preferential landscape types by grus leucogeranu in early and late overwintering periods are given in table s1 see hu 2012 the suitable types of water availability were classified on the basis of natural breaks method vehicles ships and construction activities were the main human disturbances in poyang lake and wang et al 2019b indicated the main factors affecting the habitat selection of cranes was the distance to settlement thus the distance to settlement road and dam were selected to characterize the human interference the higher the administrative level of a settlement the stronger human activity is imposed according to the previous study zhang 2016 the distance thresholds of suitable types in disturbance for grus leucogeranus were classified table 2 the ahp was used to determinate the weights of environmental factors the detailed steps of ahp and sensitivity analysis were included in text 3 in supporting information table 2 shows the weights determined by ahp and classification of the selected factors for the habitat suitability the human activity and the water body distances were calculated from the land use data and landscape type i e water body respectively waterbird habitat suitability for poyang lake was assessed by overlaying the factor layers in the arcgis 10 2 software anlauf et al 2018 these data layers were translated into numerical data prior to calculation of the hsi and all data were standardized by eq 8 finally the values of hsi were calculated using eq 7 waterbird habitat suitability was graded as very high 0 75 1 high 0 5 0 75 moderate 0 25 0 5 or poor 0 0 25 on the basis of the value of hsi tang et al 2016 8 f x x min x max x min where f is the normalized factor value x is the score of a factor and xmax and xmin are the minimum and maximum scores of the factor respectively 3 5 model results 3 5 1 validation of the 2d hydrodynamic module fig 5 shows the comparison between the observed and the simulated water levels from 2010 to 2011 at three hydrological stations tangyin xingzi and duchang stations around the dpnr in this study the simulated water levels at all three stations during 2010 2011 are in agreement with the observations the values of the averaged error and the nash sutcliffe coefficient were 0 1 m and 0 975 respectively for the tangyin station 0 2 m and 0 990 respectively for the xingzi station and 0 2 m and 0 992 respectively for duchang station overall the hydrodynamic modeling had sufficient precision and could be used for later calculations 3 5 2 validation of the mce cellular automata markov module fig 6 shows the mce cellular automata markov prediction map without the sluice and the real landscape type map from the rs image on 08 december 2010 table 3 shows the statistic results of the mce cellular automata markov prediction and the rs landscape type maps the predicted and the real landscape types were consistent for 08 december 2010 in various landscapes the simulation accuracy of water body was the best 96 5 and the simulation accuracy of soft mud was the worst 75 64 the total accuracy was 0 83 indicating that the mce cellular automata markov model established in this study had acceptable performance 3 5 3 performance of the hmh model in the middle overwintering period fig 7 a shows the spatial distribution of water body distance with and without sluice in the middle overwintering period table 4 shows the area and the proportion statistic of water body distance for grus leucogeranus the area with the very high suitability occupied 218 12 km2 accounting for 53 07 of the total study area table 4 whereas the area with the poor suitability comprised 45 99 km2 which equates to 11 19 of the total study area following sluice operation the areas with the very high suitability increased remarkably by 33 02 and 24 05 for rules 1 and 2 respectively compared with the original condition table 4 the area with water body distance greater than 1500 m still comprised the smallest portion which was 3 17 and 5 12 of the total study area for rules 1 and 2 respectively fig 7b shows the spatial distribution of landscape type with and without the sluice in the middle overwintering period table 5 shows the statistics for area and the proportion of landscape type for grus leucogeranus in the middle overwintering period in terms of the landscape type without employing the sluice hard mud occupied the largest area 155 43 km2 accounting for 37 82 of the total study area table 5 and deep water comprised the smallest area 20 22 km2 comprising 4 92 of the total study area in terms of the landscape type following sluice operation the soft and hard muds in the landscape type without the sluice were covered with shallow and deep water in rule 1 the deep water occupied the largest area 156 07 km2 which accounted for 37 97 of the total study area and a 33 05 increase compared with the landscape type without the sluice table 5 in contrast the hard mud comprised the smallest area 45 12 km2 making up 10 98 of the total study area and amounting to a 26 84 decrease compared with the landscape type without the sluice in rule 2 the meadow occupied the largest area 111 76 km2 which accounted for 27 19 of the total study area and a 1 29 increase compared with the landscape type without the sluice table 5 in comparison the soft mud comprised the smallest area 50 91 km2 which accounted for 12 39 of the total study area and a 4 25 decrease compared with the landscape type without the sluice fig 7c shows the spatial distribution of superimposed human activity distance with and without the sluice the distance maps for human activities were generated by superimposing all human activity factors in table 2 in this case study the spatial distribution of superimposed human activity distance from highways or rural township and county and city settlements produced no differences in scenarios with or without employment of the sluice this was mainly because the sluice operation would not change the locations of human activity related factors in addition the direct effects from sluice operations for example the noise from engines are negligible because the location of the sluice is more than 1200 m away from the reserve area fig 2 therefore the habitat suitability with regards to human activity disturbance with the planed sluice was the same as that without the sluice fig 8 shows the spatial feature of the habitat suitability without the sluice and with the sluice operation in rules 1 and 2 of the middle overwintering period table 6 shows the area and the proportion statistics of the habitat suitability for grus leucogeranus in the middle overwintering period in terms of the suitability without the sluice the suitable habitat area with very high and high suitability 214 83 km2 was evenly distributed in the southern and northern dpnr which accounted for 52 27 of the total study area table 6 the places with moderate suitability occupied the largest area 126 79 km2 which accounted for 30 85 of the total study area table 6 in addition the uncertainty analysis of habitat suitability was performed fig s6 on the basis of the sensitivity analysis of ahp the weight exerted a certain effect on the suitable habitat area but the law remained unchanged fig s6 the suitable habitat area of rule 1 was smaller than the areas of rule 2 and no sluice in terms of the suitability under the sluice operation in rule 1 the suitable habitat remained in the southern dpnr covering an area of 176 32 km2 this area accounted for 42 9 of the total study area representing a 9 37 decrease compared with the habitat without the sluice table 6 however the area with moderate suitability increased substantially in the northern dpnr this result was due to the water storage by the sluice which increased the area of water body but replaced the shallow water and mud with deep water causing a reduction in grus leucogeranus habitat the places with moderate suitability still occupied the largest area 201 72 km2 which accounted for 49 08 of the total study area suitability conditions following sluice operation in rule 2 showed that the suitable habitat 214 99 km2 remained in the southern and northern dpnr which accounted for 52 31 of the total study area essentially equal to the habitat without the sluice and a 9 41 increase compared with the habitat under the sluice operation in rule 1 table 6 however the location of suitable habitat moved southward in the northern dpnr this result was due to water storage by the sluice with suitable water level which increased the area of water body and replaced the hard mud with shallow water bringing benefits to grus leucogeranus habitation the area with moderate suitability still occupied the largest area 163 66 km2 which accounted for 39 82 of the total study area 3 5 4 performance of the hmh model in the start and lateness of the overwintering period fig 9 shows the spatial feature of the habitat suitability in the start and lateness of the overwintering period table 7 shows the area and the proportion statistics of the habitat suitability for grus leucogeranus in terms of the suitability in the start of overwintering period the suitable habitat 247 07 km2 was evenly distributed in the southern and northern dpnr accounting for 60 12 of the total study area table 7 the places with moderate suitability occupied the largest area 148 81 km2 accounting for 36 21 of the total study area table 6 the scheduled sluice had little impact on dpnr during this period due to the similar water level process with no sluice in late wintering period a large amount of soft mud is transformed into hard mud and meadow figs 7 and s5 and the suitable habitat 20 96 for g leucogeranus reduced significantly the sluice operation would change the location of the suitable habitat fig 9 due to the spatial shift of shallow water in the northern dpnr fig s5 meanwhile the suitable habitat 25 51 in the dpnr would be slightly increased under the sluice operation in rule 2 implying positive effect of the sluice on the habitat of g leucogeranus in the late overwintering period 4 discussion 4 1 significance of hydrological regime on waterbird habitat suitability hydrological regimes are the main driving factors of wetland ecological processes d odorico et al 2010 silvertown et al 1999 the feeding places migration behavior and spatial distribution of grus leucogeranus are highly dependent on the seasonal water level fluctuations liu et al 2011 xia et al 2010 have reported that water level is negatively related to habitat suitability for waterbirds at poyang lake due to the threshold water depth for living for example the maximum water depth for foraging of grus leucogeranus and cygnus columbianus is about 50 and 70 cm respectively xia et al 2010 the water level of the poyang lake was high at the beginning of the overwintering period about november to december of grus leucogeranus making mud and meadow with high elevations the main habitat as the water level gradually dropped in the middle period december to the january of following year the water depth of plnnr reached suitable condition for grus leucogeranus about 50 cm and the shallow water became the main habitat of grus leucogeranus the water level of plnnr gradually dropped down in late winter the january to march of following year then grus leucogeranus moved to the mud and shallow water of main lake near the dpnr hu 2012 in general the hydrological and hydrodynamic models were mainly applied to simulate the hydrological regimes in large seasonally flooded wetland because they can capture the water level process of dry wet alternation well yao et al 2020 yu et al 2020 however the hydrological model is not suitable for modelling the scenario with a planned hydraulic structure due to the backwater of the hydraulic structure neitsch et al 2011 therefore a 2d hydrodynamic model was used in this study to overcome this deficiency the hydrodynamic model could accurately simulate the hydrological regimes of poyang lake wetland with without the sluice demonstrating the superiority for hydrological regimes simulation in large seasonally flooded wetland it is noticed that the simulation results of the hydrodynamic model had relatively high error in dry season and the maximum deviation between simulated and observed water level reached about 0 5 m this may result in more water bodies and longer inundation days and thus affect the prediction of landscape type in mce cellular automata markov module the major reason is that the water surface of the studied area is largely disconnected due to low water level in dry season forming a number of scattered dish shaped small water bodies sublakes and such dynamic process is difficult to be accurately captured in hydrodynamic model yao et al 2019 however the problem can be remediated by obtaining more spatially intensive hydrological observation data to calibrate the hydrodynamic model the study could help decision makers to compare the effects of different water level dispatching plans and provide an effective reference for eco hydrological management of the wetlands 4 2 applicability of hmh model for waterbird habitat suitability evaluation some researchers have tried to use rs technology and the generalized linear model to evaluate the effects of hydraulic structures on habitats for waterbirds guan et al 2016 li et al 2019 however due to the limitations of rs observation in space and time this method has large uncertainties and is incapable of performing the multi scene simulation chen et al 2020b and yao et al 2019 attempted to establish a method to evaluate waterbird habitat using a single hydrodynamic model but they have not included waterbird habitat outside specific water bodies i e meadow mud etc this study developed an effective hmh model that could be used to predict the effect of a hydraulic structure on the complete habitat for waterbirds and assist in modelling wetland eco hydrological conditions the developed hmh model considered the impact of hydrological processes on the habitat in the mce cellular automata markov module which could provide a way to estimate ecological flows the minimum water flow to maintain the ecological balance for downstream biota for waterbirds through simulations of different scenarios the model could be used to assess the habitats for other waterbirds by adjusting the preferred habitat and threshold of deep and shallow water for example the habitat for tundra swan cygnus columbianus could be assessed by regarding mud and shallow water as the most suitable habitat and using 80 cm as the threshold for deep shallow water in habitat suitability module tang et al 2016 the model can also be extended to other regions for instance the everglades usa where wetlands are restored by building gates at the lake entrance brennan and dodd 2009 the habitat suitability of waterbird after gate construction can be evaluated by changing the inflow at the lake entrance in the hydrodynamic model according to the proposed operation plan 4 3 limitations and future studies in this study landscape type was used to characterize the preferred habitat of grus leucogeranus in its overwintering period dry season however food availability plays an important role in habitat preference the main food for grus leucogeranus is submerged vegetation which is mainly affected by the hydrological process in wet season chen et al 2020b therefore the relationship between hydrological processes in wet season and submerged vegetation should be considered in future modeling processes in addition the natural interval method which has been widely used to classify the suitability of environmental factor when relevant data is insufficient dong et al 2013 tang et al 2016 was adopted to classify the water body distance in this study in future the classification of water body distance should be based on detailed investigations of the relationship between water distance and distribution of grus leucogeranus the direct and indirect impacts of the sluice on the human activity distance was neglected in this study because the location of the sluice is far away from dpnr and the sluice operation would not change the locations of human activities however construction of water resource projects sometimes lead to human relocation due to land inundation tan and yao 2006 mavhura et al 2017 or uncomfortable noises from high flow discharge and machine operations lian et al 2017 celi et al 2016 these can directly or indirectly cause human activity impacts on the habitats of waterbirds the developed model holds the capability to assess these impacts incurred by human activities although they were neglected in this case study 5 conclusions an integrated habitat model which combines a hydrodynamic module a multicriteria evaluation cellular automata markov module and a habitat suitability module hmh was developed to assess the effects of sluice on the overwintering habitat of waterbirds the model was applied to poyang lake the largest wintering habitat for waterbirds in asia the impacts of the poyang lake sluice on the habitat suitability for grus leucogeranus in the dpnr were evaluated results showed that the sluice increased the capacity of water body during the dry season and exerted little effect on the habitats in the early overwintering period but remarkably affected reduced improved area or changed location the suitable habitats for grus leucogeranus in the northern dpnr during the middle and late overwintering periods in the middle overwintering period the sluice operation in rule 1 proposed by jiangxi provincial water resources department in 2013 decreased the proportions of suitable habitats compared with no sluice the sluice operation in rule 2 proposed by jiangxi provincial water resources department in 2016 had no remarkable influence on the suitable habitat area for grus leucogeranus but the location of the suitable habitat in the northern dpnr moved southward in the late overwintering period the location of the suitable habitat in the northern dpnr moved southward under the sluice operation and the sluice operation in rule 2 increased the proportions of suitable habitats compared with no sluice the developed hmh model which considers the impact of hydrological processes on waterbird habitat in the mce cellular automata markov module could make up for the deficit in the traditional aquatic habitat model that results in an inadequate assessment of the impacts of water resources projects on waterbird habitat due to the intermittent use of terrestrial habitats by waterbirds furthermore the hmh model could also provide an effective way to estimate ecological flows for waterbirds through the simulation of different scenarios the established new approach provides a viable way to assess the ecological impacts of water resource projects on wetlands and can be easily transferred to other similar studies credit authorship

3593,reliable and accurate multi step streamflow forecasting is of vital importance for the utilization of water resources and hydropower energy system in this paper a spatial deep learning model directed graph deep neural network is proposed for multi step streamflow forecasting the proposed model uses spatial information capture process and feature aggregation process to exploit multi site hydrological and meteorological information the spatial information capture process consists of multiple convolutional layers to extract the precipitation information of meteorological stations and the feature aggregation process uses the multi layer perceptron to aggregate the precipitation information and the streamflow information the proposed model is applied in a real world case study in the upstream of yangtze river basin experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms artificial neural network long short term memory network gated recurrent unit and convolutional neural network in terms of forecasting accuracy in addition to the forecast accuracy the hidden markov regression is employed to quantify the forecasting uncertainty given by the directed graph deep neural network the uncertainty estimation result demonstrates that the hidden markov regression is able to handle the heteroscedastic and non normal forecasting uncertainty given

network rmse root mean square error svr support vector regression she systeme hydrologique europeen topmodel a physically based flood forecasting model 1 introduction streamflow forecasting plays an important role in many aspects of water resources management such as water supply flood control and power generation accurate and reliable reservoir streamflow forecasting can help water resources managers make better decisions to increase power generation benefits reduce flood control risks and improve comprehensive utilization of water resources liu et al 2019 according to the mechanism of the forecasting model the existing streamflow forecasting methods are classified into three main categories physically based models conceptual models and empirical models devia et al 2015 physically based models usually simulate and predict the precipitation evaporation runoff etc in hydrological processes by solving partial differential equations of water movement such as she abbott et al 1986 ihdm rogers et al 1985 the advantage is that the model parameters have strict physical interpretation but it is difficult to solve the problem of excessive computational the conceptual models use approximate equations to describe the physical processes in the hydrological cycle on the basis of the mass conservation equation and momentum conservation equation such as arno todini 1996 and topmodel beven et al 1984 the approximate equation parameters of the conceptual model need to be calibrated with historical data and then a hydrological model for a specific area can be obtained the empirical models which are also called data driven models exploring the correlation between streamflow and forecast factors from historical hydrological data and then predict the streamflow for a forecast horizon based on the existing hydrological forecast factors the data driven models are simple in principle and convenient in application since the 1960 s the data driven model has been continuously developed and successfully applied in the field of hydrological forecasting such as multiple linear regression model lr diskin 1970 autoregressive ar salas et al 1985 autoregressive moving average arma salas and obeysekera 1982 and autoregressive integrated moving average model arima montanari et al 1997 however early data driven models are usually linear and it is difficult to capture the complex nonlinear characteristics of hydrological processes in hydrological models zhang et al 2015 with the rapid development of artificial intelligence and computer technology machine learning methods represented by neural networks nns have effectively solved the problem of fitting nonlinear sequences kohonen 1988 chiang et al 2004 applied a two step ahead recurrent neural network rnn to hydrological streamflow forecasting and used a real time recursive learning method to train model parameters compared with time series analysis methods such as arma the forecasting accuracy of the rnn model is higher chang et al 2004 wu et al 2009 established k nearest neighbors knn nn and support vector regression svr machine learning models to forecast monthly streamflow in different forecast horizon the research results found that the svr model is superior to other machine learning methods in most cases wu et al 2009 yang et al 2017 incorporated the atmospheric circulation index into the forecast factors of monthly streamflow forecasting and established three machine learning forecasting models random forest nn and svr and the results showed that all three machine learning models can obtain high forecast accuracy yang et al 2017 with the great improvement of the computing ability of computer central processor and graphics processor deep learning method has been widely used in many fields such as long term and short term memory network model lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 and gated recurrent unit network model gru cho et al 2014 in the field of speech recognition and convolution neural network model cnn ji et al 2013 in the field of image processing in recent years the deep learning method has been gradually applied to the field of hydrological forecast gao et al 2020 applied lstm and gru to short term streamflow forecasting and compared them with nn model the results showed that the performance of lstm and gru models in multi step streamflow forecasting was better than that of traditional nn models gao et al 2020 ni et al 2020 established a wavelet transform lstm model and a cnn lstm model for monthly streamflow forecasting and the results showed that the two models outperform traditional lstm when forecasting streamflow time series ni et al 2020 although the data driven models especially the deep learning method have been widely used in streamflow forecasting in recent years and have high forecasting accuracy apaydin et al 2021 fang et al 2021 kao et al 2021 there are some shortcomings 1 the data driven model is a black box model and the model parameters do not have physical interpretation in hydrological process yaseen et al 2015 2 most data driven models only give a single point of the forecast value which cannot quantify the uncertainty of the forecast ye et al 2016 the streamflow of the hydrological stations is mainly formed by precipitation runoff and confluence bourdin et al 2012 the streamflow at the downstream station has a strong correlation with the streamflow at the upstream station and the precipitation in the area therefore the hydrological model can be regarded as a directed graph structure recently many studies on extending deep learning approaches for graph data have emerged kip and welling 2016 seo et al 2018 which aim to handle graph data with complex relationships and interdependency between objects wu et al 2021 in order to quantify the uncertainty of forecast results bayesian model average duan et al 2007 lower upper bound estimate khosravi et al 2011 gaussian process regression sun et al 2014 hidden markov regression hmr liu et al 2018 and other methods have gradually emerged in this work we propose a directed graph deep neural network dgdnn for multi step daily streamflow forecasting and apply the hmr to quantify the uncertainty of forecast major contributions are outlined as follows 1 first and foremost a spatial deep learning model dgdnn is proposed for multi step streamflow forecasting different from the existing data driven model the proposed model uses spatial information capture process to simulate the rainfall runoff and uses feature aggregation process to simulate the confluence process which makes the model physically meaningful 2 hmr is applied to quantify the forecasting uncertainty given by dgdnn the uncertainty estimation result demonstrates that hmr is able to handle the heteroscedastic and non normal forecasting uncertainty given by dgdnn 3 the proposed model is applied to the upstream of yangtze river basin the results are compared with four machine learning techniques including ann lstm gru and cnn the results show that the proposed model outperforms all other four techniques in terms of rmse and nse the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the study data and problem description used in this paper the methodology of vbnn is given in detail in section 3 the methodology of dgdnn is given in detail in section 4 the experimental results of dgdnn and other comparison models are given in section 5 we give our conclusions 2 data and problem 2 1 data collection all hydrological stations and meteorological stations used in this paper are located on the upstream of yangtze river basin the river basin is bounded by longitudes 90 33 e to 112 25 e and latitudes 24 30 n to 35 45 n the dataset we used in this study consists of daily streamflow data from 7 hydrological stations and daily precipitation data from 83 meteorological stations the locations of these hydrological and meteorological stations are shown in fig 1 the data covers 12784 days 35 years from 1970 1 1 to 2004 12 31 the first 10220 days 28 years are used for model training and the remaining 2564 days 7 years are used for model validation in our research area pingshan station is located on the main stream of the yangtze river and its streamflow is related to the precipitation around the yalong river and jinsha river gaochang station and lijiawan station is located on the ming river and tuo river their streamflow is related to the precipitation around the ming river and tuo river the streamflow of zhutuo station is maily related to the streamflow of pingshan gaochang and lijiawan stations and the precipitation in the interval of four stations beibei station is located on the jialing river and its streamflow is related to the precipitation around the jialing river wulong station is located on the wu river and its streamflow is related to the precipitation around the wu river yichang station is the export of the upstream of yangtze river its streamflow is related to the streamflow of zhutuo beibei and wulong stations and the precipitation in the interval of four stations in general upstream meteorological information and hydrological information affect downstream streamflow while downstream hydrological information cannot affect upstream runoff there are also correlations between various meteorological stations therefore this spatial relationship can be constructed into a directed graph as shown in fig 2 in the figure the blue nodes represent hydrological sites red nodes represent meteorological stations blue arrows represent the influence of upstream streamflow on downstream streamflow and red arrows represent the influence of regional precipitation on hydrological station streamflow 2 2 problem description the three gorges project was built near the yichang station which has huge economic benefits for power generation flood control and water supply therefore the multi step daily streamflow forecasting of yichang station is necessary and important for water resources managers the objective of multi step daily streamflow forecasting is to use historical streamflow and precipitation variables in the whole study area to forecast the streamflow in the next several days this forecasting task can be called a sequence forecasting problem considering spatial information which can be formulated as follows 1 y t 1 y t k f x t j 1 x t w where k is the forecasting lead time j is the time steps of previous historical information x x t j 1 x t is the input sequence which consists of j times streamflow and precipitation variables x t pt 1 pt np it 1 it ni where pt i denotes the precipitation of the ith meteorological station at time t it i denotes the streamflow of the ith hydrological station at time t np and ni is the number of meteorological stations and hydrological stations y yt 1 yt k is the predicted streamflow sequence at target station w denotes the model parameters 3 methodology to solve the sequence forecasting problem considering spatial information a spatial deep learning model dgdnn is proposed in this paper in this section the traditional convolutional neural network cnn is introduce firstly then the proposed dgdnn is described in detail finally a probabilistic model is used to quantify forecasting uncertainty 3 1 convolutional neural network cnn cnn is a kind of neural network which uses convolution operations to extract spatial information the convolutional layer can be divided into 1 2 and 3 dimensions depending on the dimensions of the filter the main idea of convolution operations is to extract spatial information from local neighborhood on feature maps as for 1d cnn the input data is convolved by a 1d kernel and the output value at position j can be formulated as follows 2 x j l 1 f h 0 h l ω h l x r l b i r j 1 s l h where xi j 1 is the value at position j in the l th layer wh iis the kernel parameter value at position h biis the bias parameter in the l th layer f is the activation function it can be a linear function tanh function relu function and so on hl is the kernel size in the l th layer sl is the stride in the l th layer cnn has been widely used in image processing and it has been verified that it can effectively extract spatial information for classification or regression problems however cnn has the following problems in solving the problems of this paper 1 it is limited to undirected pictures or graphics and the problems in this study include a large number of directed graphs 2 convolution of two different types of information streamflow and precipitation will cause some information to be loss 3 2 directed graph deep neural network dgdnn to solve the limitations of cnn this paper proposes a dgdnn which considers the transmission of spatial precipitation information and multi site streamflow information in dgdnn the forward pass has two main processes a spatial information capture process and a feature aggregation process in the spatial information capture process the cnn layers are used to extract the precipitation information of all meteorological stations that affect a particular hydrological station this process just like the rainfall runoff process in hydrological model in the feature aggregation process the multi layer perceptron mlps are used to aggregate the precipitation information that has been extracted and the streamflow information of all hydrology stations that affect the hydrological station this process just like the streamflow confluence process in hydrological model fig 3 shows the spatial information capture process and a feature aggregation process of dgdnn in the process of rainfall runoff and converge the relationship between meteorological stations and hydrological site is a non directional graph model the runoff value is only affected to the rainfall in the basin above the station and the streamflow of downstream station is only affected by streamflow from upstream stations therefore the two processes can be formulated as follows 3 h p v c n n v p u u s p v 4 h i v m l p v i v h p v h i m m s i v 5 y σ h i 1 h i ni where v 1 ni is the index of hydrological station hpv is the hidden feature of spatial precipitation information sp v denotes the meteorological stations which affect the v th hydrological station hiv is the hidden feature after aggregation in v th hydrological station si v denotes the hydrological stations which affect the v th hydrological station σ is the output function it can be a linear function tanh function relu function and so on this paper uses a linear function to forecast the target streamflow y linear h i target mlp is recognized as a small ann model which consists of multiple fully connected layers the input layer is connected to the hidden layer by activation function f as follows 6 x j l 1 f i 1 n l w ij x i l b j where x j l 1 is the j th neuron in the fully connected layer wij represents the weight assigned to the i th layer in order to calculate the j th hidden neuron in dgdnn the spatial information capture process and feature aggregation process can effectively extract spatial precipitation information upstream streamflow information and historical streamflow information compared with traditional cnn it can express the direction of information transfer between nodes and distinguish precipitation and streamflow information which is more suitable for directed graph like hydrological forecast model in order to express the model more intuitively fig 4 shows the model framework used in this article in this deep learning framework each hydrological station performed a spatial information acquisition process and a feature aggregation process it is worth noting that in the feature aggregation process the downstream hydrological station considers the aggregation features of the upstream hydrological stations which is a recursive process therefore the most downstream hydrological station not only has a direct relationship with its neighboring hydrological stations and meteorological stations but also has a deeper indirect relationship with the hydrological stations and meteorological stations far away from it which enables the model to predict a longer forecast period through this framework we can finally use training dataset to optimize the model parameters and predict the target multi step streamflow using the trained model 3 3 forecasting uncertainty after training the above deep learning framework the multi step streamflow can be forecasted through the forward propagation by giving the precipitation spatial precipitation information and historical streamflow information of the basin however the prediction of the future streamflow is usually accompanied by uncertainty and the uncertainties of different forecast periods are also different therefore the hmr which can give a probability distribution of the streamflow liu et al 2018 is used in this paper to quantify the uncertainty of multi step streamflow forecast in hmr a hidden markov model hmm which joints forecasting streamflow of dgdnn and observed streamflow is first trained by the expectation maximization algorithm then the gaussian mixture regression is expanded to derive the conditional probability density function of the streamflow given the forecasting streamflow of dgdnn the hmm consists of hidden states and observation models where the hidden state variable obeys the first order markov process the probability of the hidden state zt only depends on the hidden state zt 1 in the previous period and the observation model depends on the hidden state variable therefore markov chain of the hidden states can be represented as a transition probabilities matrix a assuming that the observation model is a joint gaussian distribution the joint data can be divided into two subvectors x 1 x 2 where x 1 denotes the forecasting streamflow of dgdnn and x2 denotes the observed streamflow thus the mean vector and covariance matrix of the joint gaussian distribution in each state of the hmm can also be divided as follows 7 μ k μ 1 k μ 2 k k 11 k 12 k 21 k 22 k k 1 k where k is the number of states of the hmm the parameters of the hidden markov model are composed of a π μ and σ where πk is the initial probability of state k μk and σ k is the mean vector and covariance matrix of the k th joint gaussian distribution the baum welch algorithm is used to learn the parameters θ a π μ σ after learning the parameters of hmm for each hidden state k the conditional mean vector μk 2 1 and the conditional covariance matrix σk 2 1 can be obtained through the theorem of jointly gaussian distributions as follows 8 μ 2 1 k μ 2 k 21 k 11 k 1 x 1 μ 1 k 9 2 1 k 22 k 21 k 11 k 1 12 k finally according to the probability multiplication formula the total probability formula and the conditional probability formula the conditional probability distribution function of x 2 given x 1 can be derive as follows 10 p x t 2 x t 1 p x t 1 x t 2 p x t 1 k 1 k i 1 k h t 1 i a ik n x t 1 μ 1 k 11 k n x t 2 μ 2 1 k 2 1 k j 1 k i 1 k h t 1 i a ij n x t 1 μ 1 j 11 j k 1 k h t k n x t 2 μ 2 1 k 2 1 k 11 h t k i 1 k h t 1 i a ik n x t 1 μ 1 k 11 k j 1 k i 1 k h t 1 i a ij n x t 1 μ 1 j 11 j where ht k represents the hmm forward variable initialized with h 1 k πkn x1 1 μk 11 σk 11 k i 1 πkn x1 1 μi 11 σi 11 4 numerical results 4 1 model development and parameter settings to verify the performance of the proposed model dgdnn 4 forecasting models including the artificial neural network ann lstm gru and cnn are developed for comparison three predictor groups are taken into consideration for ann lstm and gru the first predictor group denoted as model in hereafter only exploits 7 day antecedent streamflow data of all hydrological stations the second predictor group denoted as model avep hereafter mainly exploits 7 day antecedent streamflow data of each hydrological station and the average precipitation in the basin the third predictor group denoted as model aallp hereafter exploits 7 day antecedent streamflow data of all hydrological stations and precipitation data of all meteorological stations in the basin next we will briefly introduce the four comparison models 1 ann ann is a popular machine learning model in the past few decades with its ability to mine the nonlinearity between data it has been widely used in the field of hydrological forecasting in this work the ann model is divided into three streamflow forecasting models ann in ann avep and ann aallp according to different predictor groups each ann model consists of an input layer one hidden layer and an output layer and the number of hidden layer nodes is 16 2 lstm lstm is a kind of rnn which is specially designed to solve the long term dependence problem of general rnn it has received extensive attention on sequence prediction problems recently similar to ann we also build three streamflow forecasting models lstm in lstm avep and lstm aallp according to different predictor groups each model consists of an input layer one hidden layer and an output layer and the number of hidden layer nodes is 8 3 gru gru is another type of rnn whose network structure is simpler than lstm and it takes less time to train the model according to different predictor groups gru is also divided into three groups of models gru in gru gru and gru aallp each gru model consists of an input layer one hidden layer and an output layer and the number of hidden layer nodes is 8 4 cnn with the development of the field of computer vision cnn has been widely used in the problem of image recognition the convolution operation in cnn can effectively identify spatial data information in this paper all streamflow and precipitation information factors are composed of a one dimensional tensor which is used as the input of the cnn then we use the output spatial features of the three layer one dimensional cnn as the input of the fully connected neural network and use the fully connected layer to forecast the multi step streamflow 5 dgdnn compared with cnn the proposed dgdnn in this paper considers the spatial characteristics of precipitation sites and hydrological stations which can better reflect the directional propagation of meteorological and hydrological characteristics in this paper dgdnn consists of 7 spatial information capture processes and 7 feature aggregation processes according to the characteristics of the basin in summary a total of 11 models have been developed in this paper all of which are performed on a single nvidia geforce 940mx gpu on python 3 6 and keras 2 2 4 with tensorflow 1 11 0 backend all models are trained by the adam optimizer with 300 epochs and also implemented using the keras package in python 4 2 comparison with other models to verify the forecast accuracy of 11 streamflow forecasting models root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse are used rmse reflects the degree of difference between the forecast streamflow and the observation streamflow a smaller value of rmse means better accuracy of the forecast nse reflects the similarity between the forecast streamflow and the observation streamflow the closer its value is to 1 the higher the forecast accuracy the rmse and nse values of multi step forecasting of the 11 models during the test time are given in table 1 and table 2 the best metrics are bolded it can be seen from the table that dgdnn performs better than cnn lstm allp gru allp and ann allp for all forecasting horizons in terms of rmse value these five models use the information of all hydrological and meteorological stations as forecasting factors the experimental results indicate that cnn performs better than lstm gru and ann when dealing with spatial information prediction problems dgdnn and cnn have a generally better performance than ann allp with 4 15 and 1 51 rmse improvements on average over all prediction tasks which is due to the convolution operation in dgdnn and cnn which can help the models capture meaningful spatial features from the underlying meteorological variables lstm allp and gru allp perform worse than ann allp for 1 3 day ahead forecasting tasks but perform better than ann allp for 4 7 day ahead forecasting tasks this phenomenon shows that the recurrent hidden states in lstm and gru can improve the forecasting accuracy for longer forecasting horizon nse pays more attention to evaluating the similarity between the forecasted streamflow process and the observed streamflow process from table 2 the results of nse and rmse are basically the same and dgdnn performs better than all other models in most of the comparisons for the three predictor groups of ann gru and lstm when the antecedent streamflow data and precipitation data of all meteorological stations are used as predictors the overall forecast accuracy of the models is the highest however the 1 day ahead forecast accuracy of gru allp and lstm allp is the worst among the three predictor groups this is because the dimensionality of the input meteorological information is too high which leads to an over fitting phenomenon when the lead time is less than 3 day there is no loop structure in the ann model so the dimensional growth of the input data has little effect on the ann fig 5 shows the 1 day ahead forecasting result of dgnn during the whole verification period from the figure we found that the forecast results of dgnn are very consistent with the observed streamflow during the verification period in order to compare the differences of each model more vividly fig 6 gives the multi step streamflow forecasting result of dgnn for 200 samples from april 10 1998 to october 28 1998 compared with lstm allp gru allp and ann allp it can be seen from the figure that the forecasted streamflow processes of the four models in the forecast horizon within 3 days are quite consistent with the observed streamflow while the forecasted streamflow processes with a forecast horizon of more than 3 days have lager errors with the observed streamflow from fig 6 a we can see that the forecasting results of the dgnn lstm allp gru allp and ann allp are relatively similar during the dry season but the forecasted streamflow of dgnn and ann allp is closer to the obseved streamflow than lstm allp and gru allp during the flood season this phenomenon indicates that dgnn and ann allp outperform lstm allp and gru allp when predict the 1 day flood streamflow although ann allp obtains high accuracy on the 1 day streamflow forecast its forecast accuracy decreases drastically with the increase of the forecast period as shown in fig 6 g dgnn lstm allp and gru allp outperform ann allp when the forecast horizon is more than 3 days in summary the proposed dgnn has the highest forecast accuracy among the 4 models in different forecast periods and different rain seasons in order to give the intuitive multi step forecast results of different models fig 7 plots the 1 7 day ahead forecast results of the four models in different time periods the four different time periods include the dry season fig 7 a period before the flood season fig 7 b the main flood season fig 7 c and period after the flood season fig 7 d the results indicate that the model proposed in this paper is able to predict the trend of the future streamflow which can provide reliable streamflow information for reservoir operation decision makers 4 3 uncertainty estimation based on the analysis of the results of the previous subsection dgnn has shown superior performance in forecast accuracy through comparison with other forecast models in addition to the forecasting accuracy this section mainly focuses on the estimation of forecasts uncertainty obtained by dgnn according to the existing research zhao et al 2016 streamflow data usually exhibit heteroscedasticity and non normality that is the uncertainty of the predicted streamflow is often much higher at high flow than at low flow and the distribution of forecast errors does not always obey the standard normal distribution traditional machine learning model and probabilistic forecasting model assume that the uncertainty has homoscedasticity characteristics and the forecast errors obey the normal distribution therefore when they are applied to estimate the uncertainty of streamflow forecasts a mathematical transformation method is needed to transform the original data into normal data firstly and then performs the mathematical inverse transformation after the forecast results are given these mathematical transformation methods such as box cox transformation method and log sinh transformation method enable traditional models to effectively estimate the heteroscedasticity characteristics of forecast uncertainty the advantage of the hmr method used in this paper is that the model itself has the ability to deal with the heteroscedasticity and non normality of forecast uncertainty without the mathematical transformation the principle is that each hidden state variable in hmr corresponds to a gaussian model and its forecasted distribution is a linear superposition of multiple gaussian distribution which does not need to perform homoscedasticity and normality assumptions on the original data and can fit any form of distribution fig 8 provides the comparisons of the 1 4 day ahead forecast mean and quantile range of the observed streamflow the light blue shade represents the 95 prediction interval the dark blue shade represents the 70 prediction interval the blue solid line represents the predicted mean of the streamflow and the red dotted line is the observed streamflow as shown in the figure the predicted mean is highly consistent with the true streamflow demonstrating that the accuracy of dgnn is high the uncertainty of the forecasts can be represented by the prediction interval the wider the interval the greater the uncertainty of the forecast it can be seen form the figure that the width of the forecast interval in the flood season is generally greater than the width of the forecast interval in the dry season which indicates that the uncertainty of the streamflow forecast in the flood season is greater than the uncertainty in the dry season the width of 1 day ahead streamflow forecast interval is very narrow and the width of the forecast interval gradually becomes wider with the increases of forecast horizon this phenomenon indicates that with the increases of forecast horizon the streamflow forecast error will become larger and the corresponding forecast uncertainty will also increase fig 9 shows comparison plots according to the 1 4 day ahead forecast mean from the figure dgnn obtains a linear relationship between the forecast and the observed streamflow which generally lies along the 1 1 line indicating that the forecasts appear to be consistent with the observed values as shown in the figure the forecast intervals are wider when the streamflow is extremely large and narrower when the streamflow is small in summary figs 8 9 demonstrate the ability of hmr to deal with the heteroscedasticity of forecast uncertainty hmr assumes that the probability forecast density function is a superposition of multiple gaussian distributions fig 10 shows two typical forecast probability density distributions it can be seen from the figure that the probability density given by hmr is a weighted superposition of k gaussian density functions when two or more weights are greater than 0 the probability density function given by hmr presents a non normal distribution as shown in fig 10 a when a certain weight is close to 1 and other weights are close to 0 the probability density function given by hmr also approaches the normal distribution as shown in fig 10 b the two figures prove that hmr does not require normal transformation of the data and can effectively describe the non normal characteristic of streamflow forecast uncertainty 5 discussion 5 1 main findings of the study the proposed dgnn uses spatial information capture process and feature aggregation process to exploit multi site hydrological and meteorological information moreover the hmr method is employed which is able to quantify the forecasting uncertainty given by the dgnn according to the experimental results we can find that the forecast streamflow sequence of dgnn is highly consistent with the observed streamflow sequence the nse value are larger than 0 98 for 1 3 day ahead forecasting tasks which can provide accurate streamflow information for reservoir managers in advance and increase the benefits of reservoir operation the estimation of streamflow forecast uncertainty shows that hmr is able to deal with the heteroscedasticity and non normality of streamflow uncertainty which provide a reliable forecast interval for reservoir managers thereby reducing the operation risks brought by forecast uncertainty 5 2 comparison with other studies the proposed dgnn is compared with four machine learning techniques including ann lstm gru and cnn in fact the model essentially is a black box model of meteorological and hydrological data from multiple sites and export flow data therefore dgnn is a data driven forecasting model the same as ann lstm and other models however unlike existing data driven models the proposed model uses spatial information capture process to simulate the rainfall runoff and uses feature aggregation process to simulate the confluence process which makes the model physically meaningful in addition to comparisons with machine learning models several recent studies kolluru et al 2020 xu et al 2021 found that simple linear model could play a good role in variable prediction which could help us to avoid the use of complex models and simplify calculation for their point we also apply the linear regression lr method to our case the rmse and nse values of dgnn cnn ann and lr are shown in table 3 in the table the rmse of lr is better than ann when the forecast horizon is less than 4 days but worse than ann when the forecast horizon is larger than 4 days the average rmse of lr is better than ann the average nse of lr is worse than ann dgdnn is better than lr in all cases these results indicate that the prediction accuracy of lr is similar to that of the ann model but lower than that of the dgdnn model which demonstrate that lr is a good prediction benchmark model for testing machine learning models 5 3 limitations and future directions although the proposed dgdnn model in this paper is proved to be an excellent streamflow forecasting model its application suffers from some limitations 1 the structure of the model is different for different forecast objects and the model needs to be established by analyzing the relationship between meteorological stations and hydrological stations 2 physical processes such as soil moisture and soil evaporation in meteorology are not considered in the model in the future more physical influencing factors can be considered in the model such as soil moisture climatic conditions etc moreover multi site streamflow forecasting is also the direction we need to study in the future 6 conclusion this study developed a novel spatial deep learning model directed graph deep neural network for multi step streamflow forecasting the proposed model is applied in a real world case study in the upstream of yangtze river basin the experimental results are compared with four machine learning techniques including artificial neural network long short term memory network gated recurrent unit and convolutional neural network the results show that the proposed model outperforms all other four techniques in terms of root mean square error and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient the uncertainty estimation is also shown and it demonstrates that the hidden markov regression is able to handle the heteroscedastic forecasting uncertainty given by the spatial deep learning model in summary the proposed deep learning method uses the idea of directed graphs to simulate the physical process of hydrological runoff formation so that the deep neural network model has an interpretable physical meaning the real world case study shows that the proposed method can obtain forecast results with both high accuracy and reliability which can provide reservoir managers with accurate and reliable streamflow forecasting information credit authorship

important role in many aspects of water resources management such as water supply flood control and power generation accurate and reliable reservoir streamflow forecasting can help water resources managers make better decisions to increase power generation benefits reduce flood control risks and improve comprehensive utilization of water resources liu et al 2019 according to the mechanism of the forecasting model the existing streamflow forecasting methods are classified into three main categories physically based models conceptual models and empirical models devia et al 2015 physically based models usually simulate and predict the precipitation evaporation runoff etc in hydrological processes by solving partial differential equations of water movement such as she abbott et al 1986 ihdm rogers et al 1985 the advantage is that the model parameters have strict physical interpretation but it is difficult to solve the problem of excessive computational the conceptual models use approximate equations to describe the physical processes in the hydrological cycle on the basis of the mass conservation equation and momentum conservation equation such as arno todini 1996 and topmodel beven et al 1984 the approximate equation parameters of the conceptual model need to be calibrated with historical data and then a hydrological model for a specific area can be obtained the empirical models which are also called data driven models exploring the correlation between streamflow and forecast factors from historical hydrological data and then predict the streamflow for a forecast horizon based on the existing hydrological forecast factors the data driven models are simple in principle and convenient in application since the 1960 s the data driven model has been continuously developed and successfully applied in the field of hydrological forecasting such as multiple linear regression model lr diskin 1970 autoregressive ar salas et al 1985 autoregressive moving average arma salas and obeysekera 1982 and autoregressive integrated moving average model arima montanari et al 1997 however early data driven models are usually linear and it is difficult to capture the complex nonlinear characteristics of hydrological processes in hydrological models zhang et al 2015 with the rapid development of artificial intelligence and computer technology machine learning methods represented by neural networks nns have effectively solved the problem of fitting nonlinear sequences kohonen 1988 chiang et al 2004 applied a two step ahead recurrent neural network rnn to hydrological streamflow forecasting and used a real time recursive learning method to train model parameters compared with time series analysis methods such as arma the forecasting accuracy of the rnn model is higher chang et al 2004 wu et al 2009 established k nearest neighbors knn nn and support vector regression svr machine learning models to forecast monthly streamflow in different forecast horizon the research results found that the svr model is superior to other machine learning methods in most cases wu et al 2009 yang et al 2017 incorporated the atmospheric circulation index into the forecast factors of monthly streamflow forecasting and established three machine learning forecasting models random forest nn and svr and the results showed that all three machine learning models can obtain high forecast accuracy yang et al 2017 with the great improvement of the computing ability of computer central processor and graphics processor deep learning method has been widely used in many fields such as long term and short term memory network model lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 and gated recurrent unit network model gru cho et al 2014 in the field of speech recognition and convolution neural network model cnn ji et al 2013 in the field of image processing in recent years the deep learning method has been gradually applied to the field of hydrological forecast gao et al 2020 applied lstm and gru to short term streamflow forecasting and compared them with nn model the results showed that the performance of lstm and gru models in multi step streamflow forecasting was better than that of traditional nn models gao et al 2020 ni et al 2020 established a wavelet transform lstm model and a cnn lstm model for monthly streamflow forecasting and the results showed that the two models outperform traditional lstm when forecasting streamflow time series ni et al 2020 although the data driven models especially the deep learning method have been widely used in streamflow forecasting in recent years and have high forecasting accuracy apaydin et al 2021 fang et al 2021 kao et al 2021 there are some shortcomings 1 the data driven model is a black box model and the model parameters do not have physical interpretation in hydrological process yaseen et al 2015 2 most data driven models only give a single point of the forecast value which cannot quantify the uncertainty of the forecast ye et al 2016 the streamflow of the hydrological stations is mainly formed by precipitation runoff and confluence bourdin et al 2012 the streamflow at the downstream station has a strong correlation with the streamflow at the upstream station and the precipitation in the area therefore the hydrological model can be regarded as a directed graph structure recently many studies on extending deep learning approaches for graph data have emerged kip and welling 2016 seo et al 2018 which aim to handle graph data with complex relationships and interdependency between objects wu et al 2021 in order to quantify the uncertainty of forecast results bayesian model average duan et al 2007 lower upper bound estimate khosravi et al 2011 gaussian process regression sun et al 2014 hidden markov regression hmr liu et al 2018 and other methods have gradually emerged in this work we propose a directed graph deep neural network dgdnn for multi step daily streamflow forecasting and apply the hmr to quantify the uncertainty of forecast major contributions are outlined as follows 1 first and foremost a spatial deep learning model dgdnn is proposed for multi step streamflow forecasting different from the existing data driven model the proposed model uses spatial information capture process to simulate the rainfall runoff and uses feature aggregation process to simulate the confluence process which makes the model physically meaningful 2 hmr is applied to quantify the forecasting uncertainty given by dgdnn the uncertainty estimation result demonstrates that hmr is able to handle the heteroscedastic and non normal forecasting uncertainty given by dgdnn 3 the proposed model is applied to the upstream of yangtze river basin the results are compared with four machine learning techniques including ann lstm gru and cnn the results show that the proposed model outperforms all other four techniques in terms of rmse and nse the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the study data and problem description used in this paper the methodology of vbnn is given in detail in section 3 the methodology of dgdnn is given in detail in section 4 the experimental results of dgdnn and other comparison models are given in section 5 we give our conclusions 2 data and problem 2 1 data collection all hydrological stations and meteorological stations used in this paper are located on the upstream of yangtze river basin the river basin is bounded by longitudes 90 33 e to 112 25 e and latitudes 24 30 n to 35 45 n the dataset we used in this study consists of daily streamflow data from 7 hydrological stations and daily precipitation data from 83 meteorological stations the locations of these hydrological and meteorological stations are shown in fig 1 the data covers 12784 days 35 years from 1970 1 1 to 2004 12 31 the first 10220 days 28 years are used for model training and the remaining 2564 days 7 years are used for model validation in our research area pingshan station is located on the main stream of the yangtze river and its streamflow is related to the precipitation around the yalong river and jinsha river gaochang station and lijiawan station is located on the ming river and tuo river their streamflow is related to the precipitation around the ming river and tuo river the streamflow of zhutuo station is maily related to the streamflow of pingshan gaochang and lijiawan stations and the precipitation in the interval of four stations beibei station is located on the jialing river and its streamflow is related to the precipitation around the jialing river wulong station is located on the wu river and its streamflow is related to the precipitation around the wu river yichang station is the export of the upstream of yangtze river its streamflow is related to the streamflow of zhutuo beibei and wulong stations and the precipitation in the interval of four stations in general upstream meteorological information and hydrological information affect downstream streamflow while downstream hydrological information cannot affect upstream runoff there are also correlations between various meteorological stations therefore this spatial relationship can be constructed into a directed graph as shown in fig 2 in the figure the blue nodes represent hydrological sites red nodes represent meteorological stations blue arrows represent the influence of upstream streamflow on downstream streamflow and red arrows represent the influence of regional precipitation on hydrological station streamflow 2 2 problem description the three gorges project was built near the yichang station which has huge economic benefits for power generation flood control and water supply therefore the multi step daily streamflow forecasting of yichang station is necessary and important for water resources managers the objective of multi step daily streamflow forecasting is to use historical streamflow and precipitation variables in the whole study area to forecast the streamflow in the next several days this forecasting task can be called a sequence forecasting problem considering spatial information which can be formulated as follows 1 y t 1 y t k f x t j 1 x t w where k is the forecasting lead time j is the time steps of previous historical information x x t j 1 x t is the input sequence which consists of j times streamflow and precipitation variables x t pt 1 pt np it 1 it ni where pt i denotes the precipitation of the ith meteorological station at time t it i denotes the streamflow of the ith hydrological station at time t np and ni is the number of meteorological stations and hydrological stations y yt 1 yt k is the predicted streamflow sequence at target station w denotes the model parameters 3 methodology to solve the sequence forecasting problem considering spatial information a spatial deep learning model dgdnn is proposed in this paper in this section the traditional convolutional neural network cnn is introduce firstly then the proposed dgdnn is described in detail finally a probabilistic model is used to quantify forecasting uncertainty 3 1 convolutional neural network cnn cnn is a kind of neural network which uses convolution operations to extract spatial information the convolutional layer can be divided into 1 2 and 3 dimensions depending on the dimensions of the filter the main idea of convolution operations is to extract spatial information from local neighborhood on feature maps as for 1d cnn the input data is convolved by a 1d kernel and the output value at position j can be formulated as follows 2 x j l 1 f h 0 h l ω h l x r l b i r j 1 s l h where xi j 1 is the value at position j in the l th layer wh iis the kernel parameter value at position h biis the bias parameter in the l th layer f is the activation function it can be a linear function tanh function relu function and so on hl is the kernel size in the l th layer sl is the stride in the l th layer cnn has been widely used in image processing and it has been verified that it can effectively extract spatial information for classification or regression problems however cnn has the following problems in solving the problems of this paper 1 it is limited to undirected pictures or graphics and the problems in this study include a large number of directed graphs 2 convolution of two different types of information streamflow and precipitation will cause some information to be loss 3 2 directed graph deep neural network dgdnn to solve the limitations of cnn this paper proposes a dgdnn which considers the transmission of spatial precipitation information and multi site streamflow information in dgdnn the forward pass has two main processes a spatial information capture process and a feature aggregation process in the spatial information capture process the cnn layers are used to extract the precipitation information of all meteorological stations that affect a particular hydrological station this process just like the rainfall runoff process in hydrological model in the feature aggregation process the multi layer perceptron mlps are used to aggregate the precipitation information that has been extracted and the streamflow information of all hydrology stations that affect the hydrological station this process just like the streamflow confluence process in hydrological model fig 3 shows the spatial information capture process and a feature aggregation process of dgdnn in the process of rainfall runoff and converge the relationship between meteorological stations and hydrological site is a non directional graph model the runoff value is only affected to the rainfall in the basin above the station and the streamflow of downstream station is only affected by streamflow from upstream stations therefore the two processes can be formulated as follows 3 h p v c n n v p u u s p v 4 h i v m l p v i v h p v h i m m s i v 5 y σ h i 1 h i ni where v 1 ni is the index of hydrological station hpv is the hidden feature of spatial precipitation information sp v denotes the meteorological stations which affect the v th hydrological station hiv is the hidden feature after aggregation in v th hydrological station si v denotes the hydrological stations which affect the v th hydrological station σ is the output function it can be a linear function tanh function relu function and so on this paper uses a linear function to forecast the target streamflow y linear h i target mlp is recognized as a small ann model which consists of multiple fully connected layers the input layer is connected to the hidden layer by activation function f as follows 6 x j l 1 f i 1 n l w ij x i l b j where x j l 1 is the j th neuron in the fully connected layer wij represents the weight assigned to the i th layer in order to calculate the j th hidden neuron in dgdnn the spatial information capture process and feature aggregation process can effectively extract spatial precipitation information upstream streamflow information and historical streamflow information compared with traditional cnn it can express the direction of information transfer between nodes and distinguish precipitation and streamflow information which is more suitable for directed graph like hydrological forecast model in order to express the model more intuitively fig 4 shows the model framework used in this article in this deep learning framework each hydrological station performed a spatial information acquisition process and a feature aggregation process it is worth noting that in the feature aggregation process the downstream hydrological station considers the aggregation features of the upstream hydrological stations which is a recursive process therefore the most downstream hydrological station not only has a direct relationship with its neighboring hydrological stations and meteorological stations but also has a deeper indirect relationship with the hydrological stations and meteorological stations far away from it which enables the model to predict a longer forecast period through this framework we can finally use training dataset to optimize the model parameters and predict the target multi step streamflow using the trained model 3 3 forecasting uncertainty after training the above deep learning framework the multi step streamflow can be forecasted through the forward propagation by giving the precipitation spatial precipitation information and historical streamflow information of the basin however the prediction of the future streamflow is usually accompanied by uncertainty and the uncertainties of different forecast periods are also different therefore the hmr which can give a probability distribution of the streamflow liu et al 2018 is used in this paper to quantify the uncertainty of multi step streamflow forecast in hmr a hidden markov model hmm which joints forecasting streamflow of dgdnn and observed streamflow is first trained by the expectation maximization algorithm then the gaussian mixture regression is expanded to derive the conditional probability density function of the streamflow given the forecasting streamflow of dgdnn the hmm consists of hidden states and observation models where the hidden state variable obeys the first order markov process the probability of the hidden state zt only depends on the hidden state zt 1 in the previous period and the observation model depends on the hidden state variable therefore markov chain of the hidden states can be represented as a transition probabilities matrix a assuming that the observation model is a joint gaussian distribution the joint data can be divided into two subvectors x 1 x 2 where x 1 denotes the forecasting streamflow of dgdnn and x2 denotes the observed streamflow thus the mean vector and covariance matrix of the joint gaussian distribution in each state of the hmm can also be divided as follows 7 μ k μ 1 k μ 2 k k 11 k 12 k 21 k 22 k k 1 k where k is the number of states of the hmm the parameters of the hidden markov model are composed of a π μ and σ where πk is the initial probability of state k μk and σ k is the mean vector and covariance matrix of the k th joint gaussian distribution the baum welch algorithm is used to learn the parameters θ a π μ σ after learning the parameters of hmm for each hidden state k the conditional mean vector μk 2 1 and the conditional covariance matrix σk 2 1 can be obtained through the theorem of jointly gaussian distributions as follows 8 μ 2 1 k μ 2 k 21 k 11 k 1 x 1 μ 1 k 9 2 1 k 22 k 21 k 11 k 1 12 k finally according to the probability multiplication formula the total probability formula and the conditional probability formula the conditional probability distribution function of x 2 given x 1 can be derive as follows 10 p x t 2 x t 1 p x t 1 x t 2 p x t 1 k 1 k i 1 k h t 1 i a ik n x t 1 μ 1 k 11 k n x t 2 μ 2 1 k 2 1 k j 1 k i 1 k h t 1 i a ij n x t 1 μ 1 j 11 j k 1 k h t k n x t 2 μ 2 1 k 2 1 k 11 h t k i 1 k h t 1 i a ik n x t 1 μ 1 k 11 k j 1 k i 1 k h t 1 i a ij n x t 1 μ 1 j 11 j where ht k represents the hmm forward variable initialized with h 1 k πkn x1 1 μk 11 σk 11 k i 1 πkn x1 1 μi 11 σi 11 4 numerical results 4 1 model development and parameter settings to verify the performance of the proposed model dgdnn 4 forecasting models including the artificial neural network ann lstm gru and cnn are developed for comparison three predictor groups are taken into consideration for ann lstm and gru the first predictor group denoted as model in hereafter only exploits 7 day antecedent streamflow data of all hydrological stations the second predictor group denoted as model avep hereafter mainly exploits 7 day antecedent streamflow data of each hydrological station and the average precipitation in the basin the third predictor group denoted as model aallp hereafter exploits 7 day antecedent streamflow data of all hydrological stations and precipitation data of all meteorological stations in the basin next we will briefly introduce the four comparison models 1 ann ann is a popular machine learning model in the past few decades with its ability to mine the nonlinearity between data it has been widely used in the field of hydrological forecasting in this work the ann model is divided into three streamflow forecasting models ann in ann avep and ann aallp according to different predictor groups each ann model consists of an input layer one hidden layer and an output layer and the number of hidden layer nodes is 16 2 lstm lstm is a kind of rnn which is specially designed to solve the long term dependence problem of general rnn it has received extensive attention on sequence prediction problems recently similar to ann we also build three streamflow forecasting models lstm in lstm avep and lstm aallp according to different predictor groups each model consists of an input layer one hidden layer and an output layer and the number of hidden layer nodes is 8 3 gru gru is another type of rnn whose network structure is simpler than lstm and it takes less time to train the model according to different predictor groups gru is also divided into three groups of models gru in gru gru and gru aallp each gru model consists of an input layer one hidden layer and an output layer and the number of hidden layer nodes is 8 4 cnn with the development of the field of computer vision cnn has been widely used in the problem of image recognition the convolution operation in cnn can effectively identify spatial data information in this paper all streamflow and precipitation information factors are composed of a one dimensional tensor which is used as the input of the cnn then we use the output spatial features of the three layer one dimensional cnn as the input of the fully connected neural network and use the fully connected layer to forecast the multi step streamflow 5 dgdnn compared with cnn the proposed dgdnn in this paper considers the spatial characteristics of precipitation sites and hydrological stations which can better reflect the directional propagation of meteorological and hydrological characteristics in this paper dgdnn consists of 7 spatial information capture processes and 7 feature aggregation processes according to the characteristics of the basin in summary a total of 11 models have been developed in this paper all of which are performed on a single nvidia geforce 940mx gpu on python 3 6 and keras 2 2 4 with tensorflow 1 11 0 backend all models are trained by the adam optimizer with 300 epochs and also implemented using the keras package in python 4 2 comparison with other models to verify the forecast accuracy of 11 streamflow forecasting models root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse are used rmse reflects the degree of difference between the forecast streamflow and the observation streamflow a smaller value of rmse means better accuracy of the forecast nse reflects the similarity between the forecast streamflow and the observation streamflow the closer its value is to 1 the higher the forecast accuracy the rmse and nse values of multi step forecasting of the 11 models during the test time are given in table 1 and table 2 the best metrics are bolded it can be seen from the table that dgdnn performs better than cnn lstm allp gru allp and ann allp for all forecasting horizons in terms of rmse value these five models use the information of all hydrological and meteorological stations as forecasting factors the experimental results indicate that cnn performs better than lstm gru and ann when dealing with spatial information prediction problems dgdnn and cnn have a generally better performance than ann allp with 4 15 and 1 51 rmse improvements on average over all prediction tasks which is due to the convolution operation in dgdnn and cnn which can help the models capture meaningful spatial features from the underlying meteorological variables lstm allp and gru allp perform worse than ann allp for 1 3 day ahead forecasting tasks but perform better than ann allp for 4 7 day ahead forecasting tasks this phenomenon shows that the recurrent hidden states in lstm and gru can improve the forecasting accuracy for longer forecasting horizon nse pays more attention to evaluating the similarity between the forecasted streamflow process and the observed streamflow process from table 2 the results of nse and rmse are basically the same and dgdnn performs better than all other models in most of the comparisons for the three predictor groups of ann gru and lstm when the antecedent streamflow data and precipitation data of all meteorological stations are used as predictors the overall forecast accuracy of the models is the highest however the 1 day ahead forecast accuracy of gru allp and lstm allp is the worst among the three predictor groups this is because the dimensionality of the input meteorological information is too high which leads to an over fitting phenomenon when the lead time is less than 3 day there is no loop structure in the ann model so the dimensional growth of the input data has little effect on the ann fig 5 shows the 1 day ahead forecasting result of dgnn during the whole verification period from the figure we found that the forecast results of dgnn are very consistent with the observed streamflow during the verification period in order to compare the differences of each model more vividly fig 6 gives the multi step streamflow forecasting result of dgnn for 200 samples from april 10 1998 to october 28 1998 compared with lstm allp gru allp and ann allp it can be seen from the figure that the forecasted streamflow processes of the four models in the forecast horizon within 3 days are quite consistent with the observed streamflow while the forecasted streamflow processes with a forecast horizon of more than 3 days have lager errors with the observed streamflow from fig 6 a we can see that the forecasting results of the dgnn lstm allp gru allp and ann allp are relatively similar during the dry season but the forecasted streamflow of dgnn and ann allp is closer to the obseved streamflow than lstm allp and gru allp during the flood season this phenomenon indicates that dgnn and ann allp outperform lstm allp and gru allp when predict the 1 day flood streamflow although ann allp obtains high accuracy on the 1 day streamflow forecast its forecast accuracy decreases drastically with the increase of the forecast period as shown in fig 6 g dgnn lstm allp and gru allp outperform ann allp when the forecast horizon is more than 3 days in summary the proposed dgnn has the highest forecast accuracy among the 4 models in different forecast periods and different rain seasons in order to give the intuitive multi step forecast results of different models fig 7 plots the 1 7 day ahead forecast results of the four models in different time periods the four different time periods include the dry season fig 7 a period before the flood season fig 7 b the main flood season fig 7 c and period after the flood season fig 7 d the results indicate that the model proposed in this paper is able to predict the trend of the future streamflow which can provide reliable streamflow information for reservoir operation decision makers 4 3 uncertainty estimation based on the analysis of the results of the previous subsection dgnn has shown superior performance in forecast accuracy through comparison with other forecast models in addition to the forecasting accuracy this section mainly focuses on the estimation of forecasts uncertainty obtained by dgnn according to the existing research zhao et al 2016 streamflow data usually exhibit heteroscedasticity and non normality that is the uncertainty of the predicted streamflow is often much higher at high flow than at low flow and the distribution of forecast errors does not always obey the standard normal distribution traditional machine learning model and probabilistic forecasting model assume that the uncertainty has homoscedasticity characteristics and the forecast errors obey the normal distribution therefore when they are applied to estimate the uncertainty of streamflow forecasts a mathematical transformation method is needed to transform the original data into normal data firstly and then performs the mathematical inverse transformation after the forecast results are given these mathematical transformation methods such as box cox transformation method and log sinh transformation method enable traditional models to effectively estimate the heteroscedasticity characteristics of forecast uncertainty the advantage of the hmr method used in this paper is that the model itself has the ability to deal with the heteroscedasticity and non normality of forecast uncertainty without the mathematical transformation the principle is that each hidden state variable in hmr corresponds to a gaussian model and its forecasted distribution is a linear superposition of multiple gaussian distribution which does not need to perform homoscedasticity and normality assumptions on the original data and can fit any form of distribution fig 8 provides the comparisons of the 1 4 day ahead forecast mean and quantile range of the observed streamflow the light blue shade represents the 95 prediction interval the dark blue shade represents the 70 prediction interval the blue solid line represents the predicted mean of the streamflow and the red dotted line is the observed streamflow as shown in the figure the predicted mean is highly consistent with the true streamflow demonstrating that the accuracy of dgnn is high the uncertainty of the forecasts can be represented by the prediction interval the wider the interval the greater the uncertainty of the forecast it can be seen form the figure that the width of the forecast interval in the flood season is generally greater than the width of the forecast interval in the dry season which indicates that the uncertainty of the streamflow forecast in the flood season is greater than the uncertainty in the dry season the width of 1 day ahead streamflow forecast interval is very narrow and the width of the forecast interval gradually becomes wider with the increases of forecast horizon this phenomenon indicates that with the increases of forecast horizon the streamflow forecast error will become larger and the corresponding forecast uncertainty will also increase fig 9 shows comparison plots according to the 1 4 day ahead forecast mean from the figure dgnn obtains a linear relationship between the forecast and the observed streamflow which generally lies along the 1 1 line indicating that the forecasts appear to be consistent with the observed values as shown in the figure the forecast intervals are wider when the streamflow is extremely large and narrower when the streamflow is small in summary figs 8 9 demonstrate the ability of hmr to deal with the heteroscedasticity of forecast uncertainty hmr assumes that the probability forecast density function is a superposition of multiple gaussian distributions fig 10 shows two typical forecast probability density distributions it can be seen from the figure that the probability density given by hmr is a weighted superposition of k gaussian density functions when two or more weights are greater than 0 the probability density function given by hmr presents a non normal distribution as shown in fig 10 a when a certain weight is close to 1 and other weights are close to 0 the probability density function given by hmr also approaches the normal distribution as shown in fig 10 b the two figures prove that hmr does not require normal transformation of the data and can effectively describe the non normal characteristic of streamflow forecast uncertainty 5 discussion 5 1 main findings of the study the proposed dgnn uses spatial information capture process and feature aggregation process to exploit multi site hydrological and meteorological information moreover the hmr method is employed which is able to quantify the forecasting uncertainty given by the dgnn according to the experimental results we can find that the forecast streamflow sequence of dgnn is highly consistent with the observed streamflow sequence the nse value are larger than 0 98 for 1 3 day ahead forecasting tasks which can provide accurate streamflow information for reservoir managers in advance and increase the benefits of reservoir operation the estimation of streamflow forecast uncertainty shows that hmr is able to deal with the heteroscedasticity and non normality of streamflow uncertainty which provide a reliable forecast interval for reservoir managers thereby reducing the operation risks brought by forecast uncertainty 5 2 comparison with other studies the proposed dgnn is compared with four machine learning techniques including ann lstm gru and cnn in fact the model essentially is a black box model of meteorological and hydrological data from multiple sites and export flow data therefore dgnn is a data driven forecasting model the same as ann lstm and other models however unlike existing data driven models the proposed model uses spatial information capture process to simulate the rainfall runoff and uses feature aggregation process to simulate the confluence process which makes the model physically meaningful in addition to comparisons with machine learning models several recent studies kolluru et al 2020 xu et al 2021 found that simple linear model could play a good role in variable prediction which could help us to avoid the use of complex models and simplify calculation for their point we also apply the linear regression lr method to our case the rmse and nse values of dgnn cnn ann and lr are shown in table 3 in the table the rmse of lr is better than ann when the forecast horizon is less than 4 days but worse than ann when the forecast horizon is larger than 4 days the average rmse of lr is better than ann the average nse of lr is worse than ann dgdnn is better than lr in all cases these results indicate that the prediction accuracy of lr is similar to that of the ann model but lower than that of the dgdnn model which demonstrate that lr is a good prediction benchmark model for testing machine learning models 5 3 limitations and future directions although the proposed dgdnn model in this paper is proved to be an excellent streamflow forecasting model its application suffers from some limitations 1 the structure of the model is different for different forecast objects and the model needs to be established by analyzing the relationship between meteorological stations and hydrological stations 2 physical processes such as soil moisture and soil evaporation in meteorology are not considered in the model in the future more physical influencing factors can be considered in the model such as soil moisture climatic conditions etc moreover multi site streamflow forecasting is also the direction we need to study in the future 6 conclusion this study developed a novel spatial deep learning model directed graph deep neural network for multi step streamflow forecasting the proposed model is applied in a real world case study in the upstream of yangtze river basin the experimental results are compared with four machine learning techniques including artificial neural network long short term memory network gated recurrent unit and convolutional neural network the results show that the proposed model outperforms all other four techniques in terms of root mean square error and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient the uncertainty estimation is also shown and it demonstrates that the hidden markov regression is able to handle the heteroscedastic forecasting uncertainty given by the spatial deep learning model in summary the proposed deep learning method uses the idea of directed graphs to simulate the physical process of hydrological runoff formation so that the deep neural network model has an interpretable physical meaning the real world case study shows that the proposed method can obtain forecast results with both high accuracy and reliability which can provide reservoir managers with accurate and reliable streamflow forecasting information credit authorship

3594,excessive anthropogenic nutrient input has resulted in eutrophication and algal blooms which have severely impacted the function and sustainability of aquatic ecosystems underscoring the need to implement nutrient management strategies it was assumed that the increasing rainfall during flood season would affect the stoichiometric ratio of total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp driving the nutrient limitation of algal growth in order to test this concept and explore corresponding nutrient management strategies nutrient addition bioassays were carried out in xiangxi bay one of the largest tributaries of the three gorges reservoir tgr china results indicated that nutrient limitation on algal growth fluctuated from nitrogen n to phosphorus p limitation n limitation dominated in the early flood season however the reduction of dissolved p accompanied with an increase of tn tp caused by an increase in extreme rainfall events intensified p limitation throughout the bay then p limitation was alleviated due to the reduction of rainfall and the process of impoundment after the flood season the variation of tn tp caused by the increasing of rainfall and flooding could be the main driving factor of the nutrient limitation shift in aquatic ecosystems mainly affected by external nutrient inputs nutrient dilution and enrichment bioassays showed that tn and tp concentration thresholds should be targeted at below 0 55 mg l and 0 057 0 064 mg l respectively to limit the growth of algae and maintain chlorophyll a below 30 μg l dual nutrient n p reductions were required for long term bloom mitigation in the entire basin this study provided a scientific basis for a nutrient management strategy to combat eutrophication and reduce algal bloom potentials in the tributaries of the tgr we recommend that long term determinations of nutrient limitation and nutrient threshold will be needed to control algal growth considering future anticipated changes in land use population density and the impacts of climate change keywords three gorges reservoir nutrient nitrogen phosphorus limitation algal bioassays extreme rainfall algal blooms nutrient thresholds 1 introduction it is well known that excessive anthropogenic nutrient loading has promoted eutrophication and the expansion of algal blooms on a global scale smith 2003 glibert and burford 2017 huisman et al 2018 ho et al 2019 seriously threatening the water quality security and sustainable development nitrogen n and phosphorus p are important nutrients mediating algal growth and bloom proliferation therefore controlling the input of n and p is considered to be an essential and effective way to mitigate these symptoms of water quality degradation lewis et al 2011 xu et al 2015a shan et al 2020 accurate assessment of nutrient limitation of algal growth in aquatic ecosystems is of fundamental importance in formulating nutrient input controls liang et al 2018 liu et al 2021 determining nutrient limitation of algal growth in the aquatic ecosystem is challenging because of the highly dynamic interactions of varying nutrient inputs rates of internal nutrient cycling and seasonal shifts in algal community composition and bloom potentials furthermore we are now aware that there is a great deal of variability in the long held paradigm that p limitation prevails in freshwater while n limitation characterizes marine systems hecky and kilham 1998 kagami et al 2013 ly et al 2014 o donnell et al 2017 with co limitation such as n p n fe p si increasingly reported along the freshwater to marine continuum guildford and hecky 2000 pilkaityte and razinkovas 2007 paerl et al 2011 2016 browning et al 2017 in addition nutrient limitation of aquatic ecosystem reflects seasonality in weather hydrology and algal community successional patterns xu et al 2015b wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 which translate into dynamic changes in nutrient concentration and stoichiometric ratio especially when considering climatic changes taking place warming increasing rainfall increasing water temperature etc particularly the increasing extreme rainfall and flooding which has been reported to play an important role in the dynamic change of nutrient chaffin et al 2014 woolway and merchant 2019 radbourne et al 2020 díaz torres et al 2021 it is therefore necessary to clarify the impacts of variations in nutrient inputs and utilization as well complex hydrologic and biogeochemical interactions on a seasonal scale such as flood season in order to assess nutrient limitation conditions on appropriate temporal and spatial scales effective nutrient management based on nutrient limitation knowledge has been implemented in some ecosystems for example p control was initially deemed successful in reducing the eutrophication in some freshwater systems schindler 2012 while more recent analyses indicate that dual n and p input controls will be needed to controlling eutrophication and harmful algal blooms along the freshwater to marine continuum paerl et al 2016 2018 wurtsbaugh et al 2019 in addition a season specific nutrient reduction strategy has been proposed based on seasonal nutrient limitation characteristics ma et al 2015 tong et al 2021 however a long term scientific and sustainable nutrient management strategy requires clear control targets which means establishing a nutrient threshold standard to protect the ecosystems from excessive nutrient enrichment and algal blooms chambers et al 2012 shan et al 2020 kim et al 2021 the nutrient threshold can be determined by the response of algal growth to a nutrient gradient with the assumption that algal growth can be controlled when the nutrient concentration is below the threshold xu et al 2015a cao et al 2016 thereby providing managers with more specific management objectives however developing thresholds is a challenge in aquatic ecosystems experiencing climatic temperature hydrology changes simultaneously with changes in nutrient inputs the three gorges reservoir tgr fig 1 is the largest reservoir in china algal blooms have proliferated in its tributaries due to the increasing nutrient loads upon its impoundment in 2003 zeng et al 2006 yang et al 2018b zhang et al 2020a cyanobacterial blooms have become more prevalent especially in the flood season with relatively higher temperature more stable stratification and higher light intensity wang et al 2011 xu et al 2021 previous studies have reported nutrient limitation of algal growth in the tgr for instance these studies reported p limitation on the mainstream and n limitation on xiangxi bay zhou et al 2009 while more recent studies showed p limitation of algal blooms in the pengxi river throughout the four seasons and in xiangxi bay in autumn li et al 2019 huang et al 2020 these studies also showed temporal and spatial variation in nutrient limitation in the tributary bays however these studies will not work in reflecting dynamic varying process of nutrient limitation of algal growth nor did these studies establish nutrient growth thresholds needed to control eutrophication algal blooms under the current pressure of human nutrient enrichment and climate change we hypothesized that the increasing rainfall during flood season would affect the tn tp and driving the shift of nutrient limitation of algal growth therefore we chose a representative tributary on the tgr for deploying nutrient manipulation bioassays nutrient dilution and enrichment bioassays during flood season the objectives were to 1 explore the spatio temporal variation of nutrient limitation on algal blooms during the flood season 2 clarify the impact of increasing extreme rainfall and flood on the nutrient limitation characteristic of algal growth 3 determine the response of algal growth to various nutrient regimes thus determine the nutrient thresholds needed to control algal growth on the increasing rainfall condition the study could help to provide the technical basis for a nutrient management strategy 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling sites the xiangxi river is located in the upstream of the three gorges dam tgd fig 1 and its mouth is about 32 km away from the tgd the length of its mainstream is 94 km and the basin area is 3183 km2 located in a subtropical continental monsoonal climate rainfall varies widely with an annual average rainfall of about 1100 mm song et al 2017 the flood season is mainly concentrated from june to mid september xiong et al 2018 wu et al 2021 accounting for about 60 of the annual rainfall the average annual upstream inflow is 40 18 m3 s a permanent backwater area was formed within a range of about 27 km from the estuary in xiangxi bay due to the impoundment of the tgr at the water level of 145 m and the countercurrent area was about 40 km at 175 m forming stratified density currents intruding into the bay from the mainstream this has an important influence on water temperature and other hydrodynamic conditions of the xiangxi bay ji et al 2017 according to the characteristics of xiangxi bay three sampling sites xx01 xx06 xx09 were established from the river mouth to the upstream xx01 in the downstream and close to the river mouth about 3 km xx06 in the middle reach and xx09 in the upstream and near the terminal of the permanent backwater area of the xiangxi bay respectively fig 1 our experimental site where the in situ bioassays were deployed was located in the middle reach of xiangxi bay xx06 which is not only affected by mainstream invasion but is also a high risk area for algal blooms yang et al 2018b 2 2 experimental methods 1 nutrient addition bioassays method for nutrient limitation of temporal and spatial variation nutrient addition bioassays were implemented every half a month to one month from june to september in 2020 to determine nutrient limitation of phytoplankton growth during the flood season water samples were collected from xx06 site 0 2 m below the water surface and dispensed in a large plastic container about 280 l thoroughly mixed and 4 l was dispensed into 5 l acid cleaned polyethylene chemically inert 85 par transparent cubitainers which were rinsed with river water before dispensing six treatments were set up and 10 mg l sodium bicarbonate nahco3 was supplied for each treatment including the control treatment to avoid inorganic carbon limitation three parallel samples were set up for each treatment three replicates and the methodology and procedures for deployment of the in situ bioassays conducted following paerl and bowles 1987 xu et al 2010 and huang et al 2020 six different treatments were administered table 1 no nutrient addition control n1 addition no3 n n2 addition nh3 n p addition p n1 and p addition n1 p n2 and p addition n2 p n1 was added as kno3 n2 was added as nh4cl with the concentration of n at 1 00 mg l p was added as k2hpo4 at a p concentration of 0 10 mg l the concentrations added were determined according to the nutrient concentration in the field huang et al 2020 after nutrient additions the cubitainers were incubated in situ to maintain the natural light and water temperature of the natural river while covered with one neutral density screen to minimize photoinhibition the day of sampling in the field nutrient additions and cultivation started was marked as day0 the days of incubation marked as day number were determined according to the growth of algae including the initial chl a at the beginning of the bioassays the entire bioassay was held to at most 3 5 days to reduce the potential container effects xu et al 2015a subsamples were collected for analysis of chlorophyll a chl a at 1 2 day intervals initial water samples in bioassays were also collected for analysis of chl a and initial condition of algal species compositions water samples were collected from xx01 xx06 and xx09 respectively for nutrient limitation bioassays at different regions on august 2nd 2020 and four different treatments were administered showed in table 2 the procedures for deployment were the same as the nutrient addition bioassays described above 2 nutrient dilution and enrichment bioassays method nutrient dilution bioassays during flood season were carried out during august 2020 water samples were collected on xx06 and diluted 30 to 70 respectively with the main ion solution mis containing si ca mg na etc table s1 and s2 which represented the water of xiangxi bay without n and p then the n and p were added separately or simultaneously to different treatments table s2 the no dilution 0 treatments were set as control the remaining methodological procedures were the same as nutrient addition bioassays to determine the algal growth limiting factors and the threshold for eutrophication abatement based on the response of algae to different nutrient concentrations xu et al 2015a cubitainers were incubated from august 7th day0 august 10th day3 water samples were collected for analysis of chl a tn and tp at 1 2 day intervals according to the growth of algae including the initial conditions at the beginning of the bioassay another enrichment bioassay during flood season was carried out in august 2020 to determine the response of algae growth to different n and p gradients water samples were collected at xx06 three replicates for each treatment and the gradient concentrations of n added as kno3 were set as 0 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 mg l with enough p 0 2 mg l the gradient concentrations of p added as k2hpo4 were set as 0 0 005 0 01 0 02 0 04 0 06 and 0 08 mg l with enough n 2 0 mg l the nutrients added daily over the first six days and the culture cycle was ten days water samples were collected every day for analysis of chl a to calculate growth rates especially the maximum growth rate for each nutrient gradient during the experiment then establish the response curves of phytoplankton growth kinetics using the monod equation to determine the nutrient threshold xu et al 2015a the algal growth could be controlled when the nutrient concentration is below the threshold the growth rate μ of each treatment was calculated according to the modified exponential growth equation xu et al 2015a μ l n x 2 x 1 t 2 t 1 where x1 is the concentration of chl a at the beginning of a certain interval t1 and x2 is the concentration of chl a at the end of a certain interval t2 t2 and t1 represented the time interval 2 3 water sample collection and analysis the samples from the nutrient addition bioassays were collected at 1 2 day intervals according to the experimental method daily surface samples in the field were collected at xx06 site from june to september in 2020 to determine the ambient tn tp and chl a for chemical and biological conditions analysis during the flood season daily surface samples collection at xx06 site for tn tp measurements were continued until october to track the variation of tn tp after the flood season tp tn and chl a were measured using spectrophotometric measurements following china s national standard method wang et al 2002 data on daily rainfall in xingshan site were sourced from meteorological data network of china the inflow of xiangxi bay were sourced from the official website of bureau of water resources and lakes of yichang http shj yichang gov cn and the data of daily water level wusong datum and inflow in the mainstream were sourced from the official website of china three gorges corporation 2 4 statistical analysis each set of data in the experiments was conducted in triplicate and the analytical result was the mean standard deviation sd of three measurements statistical significance 5 level of significance between different experimental treatments was analyzed using one way analysis of variance anova post hoc multiple comparisons were performed by least significant difference lsd p 0 05 after normal distribution test shapiro wilk and homogeneity of variance test levene post hoc multiple comparisons were performed by tamhane s t2 if not satisfied the homogeneity of variance the response curves of phytoplankton growth kinetics were established by nonlinear regression fitting on the basis of monod equation statistical analysis was implemented using origin 2021 and ibm spss statistics 22 3 results 3 1 characteristics of hydrological chemical and biological conditions during flood season the main sources of water in xiangxi bay are intrusions from the mainstream upstream inflow and rainfall confluence average value of monthly rainfall over ten years 2007 2016 and monthly rainfall in 2020 are showed in fig 2 the rainfall during the flood season accounted for about 60 of the annual rainfall the daily inflow water level in the mainstream and inflow rainfall in the upper reaches of xiangxi bay during the flood season in 2020 are showed in fig 3 five serial floods were entering the tgr during the flood season and the inflow on the tgr of the fifth flood reached the maximum about 75000 m3 s on august 20th the variation of daily water level was closely related to the inflow in the mainstream the lowest water level was 145 27 m before the formal flood season due to the increase of rainfall and inflow the water level in the mainstream began to rise at the end of june subsequently it showed a relatively lagged fluctuation with the inflow with a maximum of 167 48 m and a minimum of 153 26 m local rainfall during the flood season is mainly concentrated in june and july and the inflow was strongly affected by the rainfall in the upper reaches of xiangxi bay varying from 11 to 370 m3 s the daily concentration of tn and tp fig 4 a in the field varied greatly during flood season while relatively stable in october in 2020 the tn ranged from 0 645 to 3 441 mg l with an average value of 1 760 mg l the tp fluctuated greatly from an oligotrophic concentration of 0 013 mg l to hypereutrophic concentration of 0 142 mg l with an average value of 0 060 mg l the tn increased in early july higher than the average value and fluctuated steadily on other periods while the tp showed a decreasing trend from june to september as a whole and increased in october fig 4c the tn tp increased from june to july remained at a relatively high level from july to september and decreased in october fig 4d the concentration of chl a fig 4b represented phytoplankton biomass and 30 μg l was used as the threshold for an algal bloom in the tributaries of the tgr yao 2013 the daily chl a varied from 3 60 to 115 26 μg l with a large fluctuation above and below the bloom threshold in june and july the chl a varied from 20 23 to 112 68 μg l during the august to mid september basically in a state of persistent algal bloom and then the chl a eventually began to decrease from the mid september 3 2 characteristic nutrient limitation of phytoplankton growth in flood season 3 2 1 variation in nutrient limitation on phytoplankton growth in flood season the phytoplankton biomass chl a in nutrient addition bioassays during flood season are shown in fig 5 a total of six bioassays were conducted from june to september in 2020 treatments with n2 addition n2 and n2 p led to higher chl a in the bioassay began on june 18th fig 5a treatments with p addition p n1 p and n2 p showed a significantly p 0 05 higher chl a than others and chl a in n2 p combined addition led to highest production in early july fig 5b responses of chl a to p additions were both significantly p 0 05 higher than treatments without p addition in the bioassays from july 19th to september 7th fig 5c d e in late september treatments with n2 addition resulted in significantly p 0 05 higher chl a in prophase of cultivation p alone n2 alone addition treatments resulted in significantly p 0 05 higher chl a than n1 alone addition and control at the end of cultivation and n2 p combined addition treatment led to highest chl a fig 5f 3 2 2 nutrient limitation of phytoplankton growth at different regions during flood season the phytoplankton biomass chl a on the bioassays of different regions from august 2nd day0 august 5th day3 are shown in fig 6 the initial concentration of xx01 xx06 and xx09 were 24 83 0 63 μg l 26 85 1 38 μg l and 63 32 4 70 μg l respectively treatments of p additions in different regions all yielded significantly p 0 05 higher chl a production than without p addition on day1 similar responses appeared at the end of the incubation day3 though the chl a decreased in xx09 indicating p limitation at different regions and more p was needed on the upstream xx09 to maintain relatively high phytoplankton biomass 3 3 the responses of phytoplankton growth to nutrient dilutions and daily additions during flood season the chl a and growth rates on the dilution bioassay from august 7th day0 10th day3 are shown in fig 7 the concentrations of tn and tp for the different treatments on the dilution bioassay are shown in fig 8 the initial chl a of four dilution levels 0 30 50 and 70 varied from 24 03 18 48 12 92 and 6 54 μg l the corresponding tn and tp concentrations ranged from 1 94 1 44 1 11 0 55 mg l and 0 091 0 057 0 043 0 033 mg l respectively n1 alone additions had no acceleration on the increase of the chl a compared to the control among all the dilutions the corresponding chl a in those treatments for all the dilutions were lower than the bloom threshold of 30 μg l the p additions p and n1 p significantly p 0 05 promoted the growth of the algal growth among all the dilutions furthermore chl a was lower than 30 μg l until 70 dilution with enough p as for the growth rates all treatments with p additions showed a high growth rate at the beginning day1 among which the 70 dilution group was lower than the other three diluted groups with the consumption of nutrients the growth rates of all treatments decreased significantly as the nutrients in the cubitainers are not replenished as in the field the growth rates of the p additions were reduced to lower than 0 4 d 1 the treatments without p additions has adequate n while p was almost exhausted and showed negative growth rates the algal growth was controlled under the tn concentration 0 55 mg l of the treatments diluted with 70 and the concentration of tp 0 057 mg l in the 30 dilution group meanwhile the total biomass of algae did not exceed the bloom threshold growth rates in responses to daily addition n a and p b of varying concentrations during flood season in 2020 were showed in fig 9 the initial concentrations of tn and tp were 1 81 0 09 mg l and 0 037 0 014 respectively the growth curve fitted by nonlinear regression showed that the growth rate of natural phytoplankton in the n gradient controlled with enough p group reached to highest rapidly at a relatively low n concentration n was about 0 1 mg l due to the obvious p limitation during the experiment the growth rate of natural phytoplankton in the p gradient controlled group increased to the maximum until the p concentration reached about 0 03 0 04 mg l 4 discussion 4 1 p limitation intensity duration and range of tributaries during flood season the response of phytoplankton growth to nutrient additions in the bioassays fig 5 shows a distinct nutrient limitation variation of phytoplankton growth during flood season in 2020 the nutrient limitation variation was well corresponding to the characteristics of ambient tn tp and tn tp the nutrient addition bioassay in mid june showed a weak serial n2 limitation and p limitation started to show up in early july with a weak co limitation of n2 harpole et al 2011 this can be well explained with the increasing of tn decreasing of tp and increasing of tn tp from june to july fig 4c d a prominent p limitation from late july and lasted until the beginning of september due to the continuously decreasing tp during the flood season we observed the chl a in treatments without p addition decreased at the end of cultivation because water samples are incubated in closed containers with limited supply of nutrients however the addition of p greatly increased the intensity of the algal bloom the bioassay in late september showed a serial n2 limitation on the previous stage of cultivation as p addition has no effect on promoting the increasing of chl a this indicated that n2 was the main limiting factor an independent co limitation of n2 and p appeared at the end of the incubation period elser et al 2009 harpole et al 2011 while this may be reflected nutrient depletion due to the longer cultivation xu et al 2010 thus p was the secondary potential limiting factor actually tp has an increasing trend and tn tp has a decreasing trend from the late september to october fig 4c d explained the p limitation alleviation studies have shown that seasonal shifts in nutrient limitation of phytoplankton growth are common in many aquatic ecosystems xu et al 2010 rogers et al 2020 most nutrient limitation succession is caused by seasonal variation of internal nutrient dynamic changes or external input such as seasonal p release from sediments leading to the seasonal variation from significant n limitation in summer and autumn to p limitation in winter and spring in lake taihu paerl et al 2011 ding et al 2018 seasonal variation of hydrologic condition such as inflow storm and snowmelt could affect shifts in limitation characteristics in downstream lakes and reservoirs between n or p and even the limitation succession in a shorter period bukaveckas and crain 2002 andersen et al 2020 the present study showed a similar phenomenon that nutrient limitation of algal growth shift from n2 to p limitation then back to the main n2 limitation during flood season in 2020 our previous nutrient addition bioassay showed a potential serial n limitation of phytoplankton growth in xiangxi bay in early august in 2019 fig s1 however significant p limitation occurred from the early july in 2020 indicating an earlier p limitation or longer duration on the other hand the spatial distribution of nutrient limitation on algal growth is equally important xu et al 2013 gikuma njuru et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 for instance research in the north sea verified the offshore regional change from p to n limitation burson et al 2016 nutrient limitation of n p or even fe and other metal elements in lake taihu showed obvious regional characteristics xu et al 2015b zhang et al 2019 stratified density currents have been existed in xiangxi bay for a long time and the intrusions from the tgr could supply nutrients to the tributaries especially n as a result n decreased longitudinally from estuary towards the end of tributary bays abundant phosphate rock resources are deposited in the upstream basin of the xiangxi bay resulting higher p concentration in the upstream and lower in the middle reaches huang et al 2014 our previous nutrient addition bioassay of different regions conducted in late july 2019 fig s2 showed a significant n limitation in the upstream and potential p limitation in the middle reach the distribution of n and p could well explain the distinct regional distribution of nutrient limitation in xiangxi bay although n2 addition n2 and n2 p was not conducted in the bioassays at different regions the concurrent nutrient addition bioassay in xx06 fig 5d indicated that n2 addition has no effect on the algal growth the regional distribution of nutrient limitation during the flood season in 2020 was in contrast to the previous studies as p limitation was proven to exist in the whole xiangxi bay in early august 2020 fig 6 which showed a more extensive area of p limitation 4 2 the influence of extreme rainfall during flood season on p limitation in a tributary of the tgr the intensity and occurrence of rainfall events have increased significantly under the influence of climatic changes taking place lehmann et al 2015 giorgi et al 2019 it was reported that extreme rainfall events are occurring more frequently and the annual rainfall showed an increasing tendency in the tgr lü et al 2018 zhu et al 2021 typically the precipitation in the whole yangtze river basin was very abundant during flood season in 2020 and the peak discharge of the flood in the tgr has broken historical records fig 3 second only to 1954 the monthly rainfall of june and july in xiangxi bay was about 1 6 times than the average monthly rainfall over ten years 2007 2016 fig 2 characteristics of rainfall and its frequency distribution in a river basin play an important role in the nutrient input to the ecosystem it could significantly affect the nutrient concentration and stoichiometric ratios tn tp through direct atmospheric deposition and runoff nonpoint source pollution elser et al 2009 camarero and catalan 2012 xiong and hoyer 2018 thus driving the variation of nutrient limitation of phytoplankton growth as show previously the nutrient limitation of algal growth shift from n2 to p limitation in the early flood season and the p limitation persist until late september in the tributary of the tgr the nutrient limitation variation during the flood season was well supported by the variation of tn tp concentration and tn tp which could be affected by increasing the extreme rainfall first the increasing precipitation and runoff may bring more n load input to the water ecosystem and could exacerbate eutrophication sinha et al 2017 huang et al 2020 in particular agricultural watersheds are vulnerable to the impact of precipitation wet deposition under the influence of human activities e g n fertilizer applications increase the n concentration thus may lead to a shift from n limitation to p limitation williams et al 2017 which has also been verified in lake dianchi zhan et al 2017 wet deposition of the tgr indicated that the concentration of nh3 n was much higher than no3 n which may be related to ammonia emission from farmland in the reservoir basin zhang et al 2020b we measured the nutrient concentrations in the rainfall several times in july and verified this finding table s3 this can be more conducive to the rapid alleviation of n2 limitation and shift to p limitation in the early flood season which supported the results of our bioassays secondly we observed a dramatic decrease of the proportion of total dissolved phosphorus to tp tdp tp in flood season in 2020 fig s3 and the decreasing trend of tp during the flood season fig 4c this could further explain the observed intensive p limitation in 2020 among them that the suspended particles might play an important potential role many researches demonstrated that particle phosphorus pp could reach more than 90 of tp loss from farmland to the surrounding water carried by rainfall runoff bah et al 2020 the concentration of srp could not increase parallel with the corresponding rainfall davis et al 2015 higher concentration of suspended particles in the mainstream of the tgr with higher ability to adsorb dissolved p and particle settling tang et al 2018 wu et al 2021 may present a dilution effect for p concentration of the tributaries especially the dissolved p through density currents han et al 2018 yang et al 2018a leading to the reduction of p supply especially srp of the tributary in general the increase of rainfall intensity and frequency will increase the tn tp of the whole ecosystem and thus intensify of p limitation on the whole bay finally our bioassay in late september showed a recovery of n2 limitation and an alleviation of p limitation fig 5f this can be attributed to a decrease in rainfall from august to september followed by an increase in tp and a decrease in tn tp from the end of september to october fig 2 and fig 4 in addition the p limitation alleviation could be attributed to the initial impoundment of the tgr in mid september the variation of stratified density currents in the process of impoundment fig s5 will increase water exchange between mainstream and the tributaries zhao et al 2016 weaken the water temperature stratification in tributaries and destroy the appropriate environment for algae growth liu et al 2012 chuo et al 2019 which will help to reduce the algal blooms and accelerate the accumulation of nutrients comprehensively to ease nutrient limitation however nutrients input accompanied by the increasing extreme rainfall and flooding are not always leading to the variation of nutrient limitation the variation of tn tp and shift of nutrient limitation mainly driven by internal nutrient cycling e g seasonal p release from sediments in shallow eutrophication lakes such as lake taihu and chaohu paerl et al 2011 ding et al 2018 tong et al 2021 in contrast our study in the tributaries of the tgr supported that the variation of tn tp caused by the increasing of extreme rainfall and flooding is the main driving factor of the nutrient limitation succession in external nutrient inputs dominated systems this will be helpful to better identify the nutrient limitation and develop more scientific nutrient management under the climatic change 4 3 nutrient threshold needed to control for phytoplankton growth under extreme rainfall in flood season the flood season is a high occurrence season of algal blooms in the tributary bays of the tgr which is dominanted by cyanophyta and chlorophyta with cryptophyta or bacillariophyta as sub dominants wang et al 2011 chuo et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 similar dominant species of algal blooms occurred throughout our study during the flood season 2020 microcystis spp belong to cyanophyta as the dominant species with the highest initial frequency of occurrence species such as chlorella sp belong to chlorophyta and chroomonas acuta cryptomonas erosa belonging to the cryptophyta more appeared from late july to early august fig s6 to alleviate eutrophication and reduce the risk of algal bloom determining the nutrient threshold is the important foundation to clear reduction target in nutrient management strategies huo et al 2015 cao et al 2017 short term in situ dilution bioassays can identify the response of phytoplankton growth under nutrient reductions and thus can provide a reference for the nutrient threshold needed to control eutrophication paerl et al 1978 xu et al 2015a in our dilution bioassay the concentration of tn and tp that can limit algal growth and algal bloom are approximately 0 55 mg l and 0 057 mg l respectively the bioassays also indicated a significant p limitation in addition growth curve fig 9 in responses to daily n and p of varied concentrations additions indicating that the growth of algae could not be controlled until the concentration of spr below 0 03 0 04 mg l xu et al 2015a zeng et al 2016 in consideration of the average proportion of spr to tp during the flood season 2020 was about 47 estimated the threshold of tp needed to control eutrophication is about 0 064 mg l furthermore the maximum growth rate of algae can be restricted only when the n pulse nutrient addition concentration was controlled lower than 0 1 mg l due to obvious p limitation during the bioassay and original relatively abundant n thus the growth curve of n gradient controlled may not be representative many relevant studies have been carried out to determine the nutrient threshold to protect the ecosystems from excessive nutrient enrichment and algal blooms carleton et al 2009 chambers et al 2012 chen et al 2018 the concentration of tn and tp was recommended to be controlled under 0 8 mg l and 0 061 mg l respectively to prevent excessive cyanobacteria bloom in deep water greater than3 1 m lakes and reservoirs in the u s yuan and pollard 2015 and below 0 80 mg l and 0 05 mg l respectively to limit the growth of microcystis in lake taihu xu et al 2015a our bioassays showed that the control threshold of tn is about 0 55 mg l and tp is 0 057 0 064 mg l to alleviate eutrophication and reduce algal bloom chl a 30 μg l on the typical tributaries of the tgr the control threshold of tp concentration is similar to those freshwater systems while tn is relatively stricter possibly due to the intensified p limitation as the increasing tn tp and the originally severe overloaded n on the reservoir during the flood season xiang et al 2021 how to alleviate water eutrophication and reduce algal blooms is a global concern raising important scientific issue ho et al 2019 gobler 2020 the reduction of the nutrient load input is the most fundamental method to control algal bloom though it requires a long time to achieve which also applies to the tributaries of the tgr yang et al 2018a our results of the nutrient threshold of tn and tp can provide a reference for managers to set scientific nutrient management goals for alleviating eutrophication in the whole basin and formulate corresponding pollution load reduction measures in addition we recommend that p could be priority control relative to n especially in the context of increasing rainfall and flood as the incidence and intensity of the p limitation have increased in tributaries of the tgr li et al 2019 huang et al 2020 and the relatively economical way to remove from the water nevertheless the process of nutrient limitation succession also emphasizes the important role of n in algal growth n limitation or n and p co limitation indicating the need for n control which also can reduce the adverse effects of the reduced imbalance of n and p on the downstream ecosystems paerl et al 2018 besides high n concentration has been reported to lead to higher microcystin concentrations in water ecosystems davis et al 2015 thus we confirmed that implementing dual nutrient input controls over the long term will be more effective finally we recommend that long term determinations of nutrient limitation and nutrient threshold will be needed to control algal growth as a series of complex reactions of the aquatic ecosystems will respond to nutrient structure variation caused by the increasing impact of human activities further to take hydraulic retention time transparency phytoplankton composition etc comprehensively to determine the nutrient threshold for algal blooms control vuorio et al 2020 zou et al 2020 as well as the impact of future climate change increasing extreme rainfall global warming and rising atmospheric co2 etc on the standard of nutrient threshold and regularly improve the nutrient management solution will be more advantageous o neil et al 2012 huo et al 2019 wang et al 2020 5 conclusion the present study reports the characteristics and causes of the temporal and spatial distribution of nutrient limitations in a tributary bay of the tgr during flood season in 2020 as well as the nutrient thresholds needed to control eutrophication and reduce algal blooms nutrient limitation shift from n2 to p limitation then back to the main n2 limitation during the flood season the reduction of dissolved p accompanied by an increase of tn tp caused by the increasing rainfall and flooding intensified p limitation of algal growth of the whole bay the reduction of rainfall and the process of impoundment after the flood season combined to alleviate the p limitation the variation of tn tp caused by the increasing of rainfall and flooding could be the main driving factor of the nutrient limitation shift in external nutrient inputs dominated systems thus short term variation of nutrient limitation need be considered to develop more scientific nutrient management under the influence of climate change particularly in external nutrient inputs dominated systems nutrient dilution and enrichment bioassays indicated that algal blooms could be controlled chl a 30 μg l when the concentrations of tn and tp were lower than 0 55 mg l and 0 057 0 064 mg l respectively the control threshold of tn is relatively stricter possibly due to the intensified p limitation as the increasing tn tp and the severe overloaded n on the reservoir during the flood season thus more relates research is needed to verify this threshold p could be priority control short term while a long term nutrient management of the whole basin needs a dual control of n and p further we recommend sustained attention on nutrient limitation and long term determinations of nutrient threshold needed to control algal blooms as well as more comprehensive factors taken into consideration the present study is helpful to further understand the responses of algal growth to nutrient dynamics and can provide a reference for scientific nutrient management strategy declaration

3594,excessive anthropogenic nutrient input has resulted in eutrophication and algal blooms which have severely impacted the function and sustainability of aquatic ecosystems underscoring the need to implement nutrient management strategies it was assumed that the increasing rainfall during flood season would affect the stoichiometric ratio of total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp driving the nutrient limitation of algal growth in order to test this concept and explore corresponding nutrient management strategies nutrient addition bioassays were carried out in xiangxi bay one of the largest tributaries of the three gorges reservoir tgr china results indicated that nutrient limitation on algal growth fluctuated from nitrogen n to phosphorus p limitation n limitation dominated in the early flood season however the reduction of dissolved p accompanied with an increase of tn tp caused by an increase in extreme rainfall events intensified p limitation throughout the bay then p limitation was alleviated due to the reduction of rainfall and the process of impoundment after the flood season the variation of tn tp caused by the increasing of rainfall and flooding could be the main driving factor of the nutrient limitation shift in aquatic ecosystems mainly affected by external nutrient inputs nutrient dilution and enrichment bioassays showed that tn and tp concentration thresholds should be targeted at below 0 55 mg l and 0 057 0 064 mg l respectively to limit the growth of algae and maintain chlorophyll a below 30 μg l dual nutrient n p reductions were required for long term bloom mitigation in the entire basin this study provided a scientific basis for a nutrient management strategy to combat eutrophication and reduce algal bloom potentials in the tributaries of the tgr we recommend that long term determinations of nutrient limitation and nutrient threshold will be needed to control algal growth considering future anticipated changes in land use population density and the impacts of climate change keywords three gorges reservoir nutrient nitrogen phosphorus limitation algal bioassays extreme rainfall algal blooms nutrient thresholds 1 introduction it is well known that excessive anthropogenic nutrient loading has promoted eutrophication and the expansion of algal blooms on a global scale smith 2003 glibert and burford 2017 huisman et al 2018 ho et al 2019 seriously threatening the water quality security and sustainable development nitrogen n and phosphorus p are important nutrients mediating algal growth and bloom proliferation therefore controlling the input of n and p is considered to be an essential and effective way to mitigate these symptoms of water quality degradation lewis et al 2011 xu et al 2015a shan et al 2020 accurate assessment of nutrient limitation of algal growth in aquatic ecosystems is of fundamental importance in formulating nutrient input controls liang et al 2018 liu et al 2021 determining nutrient limitation of algal growth in the aquatic ecosystem is challenging because of the highly dynamic interactions of varying nutrient inputs rates of internal nutrient cycling and seasonal shifts in algal community composition and bloom potentials furthermore we are now aware that there is a great deal of variability in the long held paradigm that p limitation prevails in freshwater while n limitation characterizes marine systems hecky and kilham 1998 kagami et al 2013 ly et al 2014 o donnell et al 2017 with co limitation such as n p n fe p si increasingly reported along the freshwater to marine continuum guildford and hecky 2000 pilkaityte and razinkovas 2007 paerl et al 2011 2016 browning et al 2017 in addition nutrient limitation of aquatic ecosystem reflects seasonality in weather hydrology and algal community successional patterns xu et al 2015b wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 which translate into dynamic changes in nutrient concentration and stoichiometric ratio especially when considering climatic changes taking place warming increasing rainfall increasing water temperature etc particularly the increasing extreme rainfall and flooding which has been reported to play an important role in the dynamic change of nutrient chaffin et al 2014 woolway and merchant 2019 radbourne et al 2020 díaz torres et al 2021 it is therefore necessary to clarify the impacts of variations in nutrient inputs and utilization as well complex hydrologic and biogeochemical interactions on a seasonal scale such as flood season in order to assess nutrient limitation conditions on appropriate temporal and spatial scales effective nutrient management based on nutrient limitation knowledge has been implemented in some ecosystems for example p control was initially deemed successful in reducing the eutrophication in some freshwater systems schindler 2012 while more recent analyses indicate that dual n and p input controls will be needed to controlling eutrophication and harmful algal blooms along the freshwater to marine continuum paerl et al 2016 2018 wurtsbaugh et al 2019 in addition a season specific nutrient reduction strategy has been proposed based on seasonal nutrient limitation characteristics ma et al 2015 tong et al 2021 however a long term scientific and sustainable nutrient management strategy requires clear control targets which means establishing a nutrient threshold standard to protect the ecosystems from excessive nutrient enrichment and algal blooms chambers et al 2012 shan et al 2020 kim et al 2021 the nutrient threshold can be determined by the response of algal growth to a nutrient gradient with the assumption that algal growth can be controlled when the nutrient concentration is below the threshold xu et al 2015a cao et al 2016 thereby providing managers with more specific management objectives however developing thresholds is a challenge in aquatic ecosystems experiencing climatic temperature hydrology changes simultaneously with changes in nutrient inputs the three gorges reservoir tgr fig 1 is the largest reservoir in china algal blooms have proliferated in its tributaries due to the increasing nutrient loads upon its impoundment in 2003 zeng et al 2006 yang et al 2018b zhang et al 2020a cyanobacterial blooms have become more prevalent especially in the flood season with relatively higher temperature more stable stratification and higher light intensity wang et al 2011 xu et al 2021 previous studies have reported nutrient limitation of algal growth in the tgr for instance these studies reported p limitation on the mainstream and n limitation on xiangxi bay zhou et al 2009 while more recent studies showed p limitation of algal blooms in the pengxi river throughout the four seasons and in xiangxi bay in autumn li et al 2019 huang et al 2020 these studies also showed temporal and spatial variation in nutrient limitation in the tributary bays however these studies will not work in reflecting dynamic varying process of nutrient limitation of algal growth nor did these studies establish nutrient growth thresholds needed to control eutrophication algal blooms under the current pressure of human nutrient enrichment and climate change we hypothesized that the increasing rainfall during flood season would affect the tn tp and driving the shift of nutrient limitation of algal growth therefore we chose a representative tributary on the tgr for deploying nutrient manipulation bioassays nutrient dilution and enrichment bioassays during flood season the objectives were to 1 explore the spatio temporal variation of nutrient limitation on algal blooms during the flood season 2 clarify the impact of increasing extreme rainfall and flood on the nutrient limitation characteristic of algal growth 3 determine the response of algal growth to various nutrient regimes thus determine the nutrient thresholds needed to control algal growth on the increasing rainfall condition the study could help to provide the technical basis for a nutrient management strategy 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling sites the xiangxi river is located in the upstream of the three gorges dam tgd fig 1 and its mouth is about 32 km away from the tgd the length of its mainstream is 94 km and the basin area is 3183 km2 located in a subtropical continental monsoonal climate rainfall varies widely with an annual average rainfall of about 1100 mm song et al 2017 the flood season is mainly concentrated from june to mid september xiong et al 2018 wu et al 2021 accounting for about 60 of the annual rainfall the average annual upstream inflow is 40 18 m3 s a permanent backwater area was formed within a range of about 27 km from the estuary in xiangxi bay due to the impoundment of the tgr at the water level of 145 m and the countercurrent area was about 40 km at 175 m forming stratified density currents intruding into the bay from the mainstream this has an important influence on water temperature and other hydrodynamic conditions of the xiangxi bay ji et al 2017 according to the characteristics of xiangxi bay three sampling sites xx01 xx06 xx09 were established from the river mouth to the upstream xx01 in the downstream and close to the river mouth about 3 km xx06 in the middle reach and xx09 in the upstream and near the terminal of the permanent backwater area of the xiangxi bay respectively fig 1 our experimental site where the in situ bioassays were deployed was located in the middle reach of xiangxi bay xx06 which is not only affected by mainstream invasion but is also a high risk area for algal blooms yang et al 2018b 2 2 experimental methods 1 nutrient addition bioassays method for nutrient limitation of temporal and spatial variation nutrient addition bioassays were implemented every half a month to one month from june to september in 2020 to determine nutrient limitation of phytoplankton growth during the flood season water samples were collected from xx06 site 0 2 m below the water surface and dispensed in a large plastic container about 280 l thoroughly mixed and 4 l was dispensed into 5 l acid cleaned polyethylene chemically inert 85 par transparent cubitainers which were rinsed with river water before dispensing six treatments were set up and 10 mg l sodium bicarbonate nahco3 was supplied for each treatment including the control treatment to avoid inorganic carbon limitation three parallel samples were set up for each treatment three replicates and the methodology and procedures for deployment of the in situ bioassays conducted following paerl and bowles 1987 xu et al 2010 and huang et al 2020 six different treatments were administered table 1 no nutrient addition control n1 addition no3 n n2 addition nh3 n p addition p n1 and p addition n1 p n2 and p addition n2 p n1 was added as kno3 n2 was added as nh4cl with the concentration of n at 1 00 mg l p was added as k2hpo4 at a p concentration of 0 10 mg l the concentrations added were determined according to the nutrient concentration in the field huang et al 2020 after nutrient additions the cubitainers were incubated in situ to maintain the natural light and water temperature of the natural river while covered with one neutral density screen to minimize photoinhibition the day of sampling in the field nutrient additions and cultivation started was marked as day0 the days of incubation marked as day number were determined according to the growth of algae including the initial chl a at the beginning of the bioassays the entire bioassay was held to at most 3 5 days to reduce the potential container effects xu et al 2015a subsamples were collected for analysis of chlorophyll a chl a at 1 2 day intervals initial water samples in bioassays were also collected for analysis of chl a and initial condition of algal species compositions water samples were collected from xx01 xx06 and xx09 respectively for nutrient limitation bioassays at different regions on august 2nd 2020 and four different treatments were administered showed in table 2 the procedures for deployment were the same as the nutrient addition bioassays described above 2 nutrient dilution and enrichment bioassays method nutrient dilution bioassays during flood season were carried out during august 2020 water samples were collected on xx06 and diluted 30 to 70 respectively with the main ion solution mis containing si ca mg na etc table s1 and s2 which represented the water of xiangxi bay without n and p then the n and p were added separately or simultaneously to different treatments table s2 the no dilution 0 treatments were set as control the remaining methodological procedures were the same as nutrient addition bioassays to determine the algal growth limiting factors and the threshold for eutrophication abatement based on the response of algae to different nutrient concentrations xu et al 2015a cubitainers were incubated from august 7th day0 august 10th day3 water samples were collected for analysis of chl a tn and tp at 1 2 day intervals according to the growth of algae including the initial conditions at the beginning of the bioassay another enrichment bioassay during flood season was carried out in august 2020 to determine the response of algae growth to different n and p gradients water samples were collected at xx06 three replicates for each treatment and the gradient concentrations of n added as kno3 were set as 0 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 mg l with enough p 0 2 mg l the gradient concentrations of p added as k2hpo4 were set as 0 0 005 0 01 0 02 0 04 0 06 and 0 08 mg l with enough n 2 0 mg l the nutrients added daily over the first six days and the culture cycle was ten days water samples were collected every day for analysis of chl a to calculate growth rates especially the maximum growth rate for each nutrient gradient during the experiment then establish the response curves of phytoplankton growth kinetics using the monod equation to determine the nutrient threshold xu et al 2015a the algal growth could be controlled when the nutrient concentration is below the threshold the growth rate μ of each treatment was calculated according to the modified exponential growth equation xu et al 2015a μ l n x 2 x 1 t 2 t 1 where x1 is the concentration of chl a at the beginning of a certain interval t1 and x2 is the concentration of chl a at the end of a certain interval t2 t2 and t1 represented the time interval 2 3 water sample collection and analysis the samples from the nutrient addition bioassays were collected at 1 2 day intervals according to the experimental method daily surface samples in the field were collected at xx06 site from june to september in 2020 to determine the ambient tn tp and chl a for chemical and biological conditions analysis during the flood season daily surface samples collection at xx06 site for tn tp measurements were continued until october to track the variation of tn tp after the flood season tp tn and chl a were measured using spectrophotometric measurements following china s national standard method wang et al 2002 data on daily rainfall in xingshan site were sourced from meteorological data network of china the inflow of xiangxi bay were sourced from the official website of bureau of water resources and lakes of yichang http shj yichang gov cn and the data of daily water level wusong datum and inflow in the mainstream were sourced from the official website of china three gorges corporation 2 4 statistical analysis each set of data in the experiments was conducted in triplicate and the analytical result was the mean standard deviation sd of three measurements statistical significance 5 level of significance between different experimental treatments was analyzed using one way analysis of variance anova post hoc multiple comparisons were performed by least significant difference lsd p 0 05 after normal distribution test shapiro wilk and homogeneity of variance test levene post hoc multiple comparisons were performed by tamhane s t2 if not satisfied the homogeneity of variance the response curves of phytoplankton growth kinetics were established by nonlinear regression fitting on the basis of monod equation statistical analysis was implemented using origin 2021 and ibm spss statistics 22 3 results 3 1 characteristics of hydrological chemical and biological conditions during flood season the main sources of water in xiangxi bay are intrusions from the mainstream upstream inflow and rainfall confluence average value of monthly rainfall over ten years 2007 2016 and monthly rainfall in 2020 are showed in fig 2 the rainfall during the flood season accounted for about 60 of the annual rainfall the daily inflow water level in the mainstream and inflow rainfall in the upper reaches of xiangxi bay during the flood season in 2020 are showed in fig 3 five serial floods were entering the tgr during the flood season and the inflow on the tgr of the fifth flood reached the maximum about 75000 m3 s on august 20th the variation of daily water level was closely related to the inflow in the mainstream the lowest water level was 145 27 m before the formal flood season due to the increase of rainfall and inflow the water level in the mainstream began to rise at the end of june subsequently it showed a relatively lagged fluctuation with the inflow with a maximum of 167 48 m and a minimum of 153 26 m local rainfall during the flood season is mainly concentrated in june and july and the inflow was strongly affected by the rainfall in the upper reaches of xiangxi bay varying from 11 to 370 m3 s the daily concentration of tn and tp fig 4 a in the field varied greatly during flood season while relatively stable in october in 2020 the tn ranged from 0 645 to 3 441 mg l with an average value of 1 760 mg l the tp fluctuated greatly from an oligotrophic concentration of 0 013 mg l to hypereutrophic concentration of 0 142 mg l with an average value of 0 060 mg l the tn increased in early july higher than the average value and fluctuated steadily on other periods while the tp showed a decreasing trend from june to september as a whole and increased in october fig 4c the tn tp increased from june to july remained at a relatively high level from july to september and decreased in october fig 4d the concentration of chl a fig 4b represented phytoplankton biomass and 30 μg l was used as the threshold for an algal bloom in the tributaries of the tgr yao 2013 the daily chl a varied from 3 60 to 115 26 μg l with a large fluctuation above and below the bloom threshold in june and july the chl a varied from 20 23 to 112 68 μg l during the august to mid september basically in a state of persistent algal bloom and then the chl a eventually began to decrease from the mid september 3 2 characteristic nutrient limitation of phytoplankton growth in flood season 3 2 1 variation in nutrient limitation on phytoplankton growth in flood season the phytoplankton biomass chl a in nutrient addition bioassays during flood season are shown in fig 5 a total of six bioassays were conducted from june to september in 2020 treatments with n2 addition n2 and n2 p led to higher chl a in the bioassay began on june 18th fig 5a treatments with p addition p n1 p and n2 p showed a significantly p 0 05 higher chl a than others and chl a in n2 p combined addition led to highest production in early july fig 5b responses of chl a to p additions were both significantly p 0 05 higher than treatments without p addition in the bioassays from july 19th to september 7th fig 5c d e in late september treatments with n2 addition resulted in significantly p 0 05 higher chl a in prophase of cultivation p alone n2 alone addition treatments resulted in significantly p 0 05 higher chl a than n1 alone addition and control at the end of cultivation and n2 p combined addition treatment led to highest chl a fig 5f 3 2 2 nutrient limitation of phytoplankton growth at different regions during flood season the phytoplankton biomass chl a on the bioassays of different regions from august 2nd day0 august 5th day3 are shown in fig 6 the initial concentration of xx01 xx06 and xx09 were 24 83 0 63 μg l 26 85 1 38 μg l and 63 32 4 70 μg l respectively treatments of p additions in different regions all yielded significantly p 0 05 higher chl a production than without p addition on day1 similar responses appeared at the end of the incubation day3 though the chl a decreased in xx09 indicating p limitation at different regions and more p was needed on the upstream xx09 to maintain relatively high phytoplankton biomass 3 3 the responses of phytoplankton growth to nutrient dilutions and daily additions during flood season the chl a and growth rates on the dilution bioassay from august 7th day0 10th day3 are shown in fig 7 the concentrations of tn and tp for the different treatments on the dilution bioassay are shown in fig 8 the initial chl a of four dilution levels 0 30 50 and 70 varied from 24 03 18 48 12 92 and 6 54 μg l the corresponding tn and tp concentrations ranged from 1 94 1 44 1 11 0 55 mg l and 0 091 0 057 0 043 0 033 mg l respectively n1 alone additions had no acceleration on the increase of the chl a compared to the control among all the dilutions the corresponding chl a in those treatments for all the dilutions were lower than the bloom threshold of 30 μg l the p additions p and n1 p significantly p 0 05 promoted the growth of the algal growth among all the dilutions furthermore chl a was lower than 30 μg l until 70 dilution with enough p as for the growth rates all treatments with p additions showed a high growth rate at the beginning day1 among which the 70 dilution group was lower than the other three diluted groups with the consumption of nutrients the growth rates of all treatments decreased significantly as the nutrients in the cubitainers are not replenished as in the field the growth rates of the p additions were reduced to lower than 0 4 d 1 the treatments without p additions has adequate n while p was almost exhausted and showed negative growth rates the algal growth was controlled under the tn concentration 0 55 mg l of the treatments diluted with 70 and the concentration of tp 0 057 mg l in the 30 dilution group meanwhile the total biomass of algae did not exceed the bloom threshold growth rates in responses to daily addition n a and p b of varying concentrations during flood season in 2020 were showed in fig 9 the initial concentrations of tn and tp were 1 81 0 09 mg l and 0 037 0 014 respectively the growth curve fitted by nonlinear regression showed that the growth rate of natural phytoplankton in the n gradient controlled with enough p group reached to highest rapidly at a relatively low n concentration n was about 0 1 mg l due to the obvious p limitation during the experiment the growth rate of natural phytoplankton in the p gradient controlled group increased to the maximum until the p concentration reached about 0 03 0 04 mg l 4 discussion 4 1 p limitation intensity duration and range of tributaries during flood season the response of phytoplankton growth to nutrient additions in the bioassays fig 5 shows a distinct nutrient limitation variation of phytoplankton growth during flood season in 2020 the nutrient limitation variation was well corresponding to the characteristics of ambient tn tp and tn tp the nutrient addition bioassay in mid june showed a weak serial n2 limitation and p limitation started to show up in early july with a weak co limitation of n2 harpole et al 2011 this can be well explained with the increasing of tn decreasing of tp and increasing of tn tp from june to july fig 4c d a prominent p limitation from late july and lasted until the beginning of september due to the continuously decreasing tp during the flood season we observed the chl a in treatments without p addition decreased at the end of cultivation because water samples are incubated in closed containers with limited supply of nutrients however the addition of p greatly increased the intensity of the algal bloom the bioassay in late september showed a serial n2 limitation on the previous stage of cultivation as p addition has no effect on promoting the increasing of chl a this indicated that n2 was the main limiting factor an independent co limitation of n2 and p appeared at the end of the incubation period elser et al 2009 harpole et al 2011 while this may be reflected nutrient depletion due to the longer cultivation xu et al 2010 thus p was the secondary potential limiting factor actually tp has an increasing trend and tn tp has a decreasing trend from the late september to october fig 4c d explained the p limitation alleviation studies have shown that seasonal shifts in nutrient limitation of phytoplankton growth are common in many aquatic ecosystems xu et al 2010 rogers et al 2020 most nutrient limitation succession is caused by seasonal variation of internal nutrient dynamic changes or external input such as seasonal p release from sediments leading to the seasonal variation from significant n limitation in summer and autumn to p limitation in winter and spring in lake taihu paerl et al 2011 ding et al 2018 seasonal variation of hydrologic condition such as inflow storm and snowmelt could affect shifts in limitation characteristics in downstream lakes and reservoirs between n or p and even the limitation succession in a shorter period bukaveckas and crain 2002 andersen et al 2020 the present study showed a similar phenomenon that nutrient limitation of algal growth shift from n2 to p limitation then back to the main n2 limitation during flood season in 2020 our previous nutrient addition bioassay showed a potential serial n limitation of phytoplankton growth in xiangxi bay in early august in 2019 fig s1 however significant p limitation occurred from the early july in 2020 indicating an earlier p limitation or longer duration on the other hand the spatial distribution of nutrient limitation on algal growth is equally important xu et al 2013 gikuma njuru et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 for instance research in the north sea verified the offshore regional change from p to n limitation burson et al 2016 nutrient limitation of n p or even fe and other metal elements in lake taihu showed obvious regional characteristics xu et al 2015b zhang et al 2019 stratified density currents have been existed in xiangxi bay for a long time and the intrusions from the tgr could supply nutrients to the tributaries especially n as a result n decreased longitudinally from estuary towards the end of tributary bays abundant phosphate rock resources are deposited in the upstream basin of the xiangxi bay resulting higher p concentration in the upstream and lower in the middle reaches huang et al 2014 our previous nutrient addition bioassay of different regions conducted in late july 2019 fig s2 showed a significant n limitation in the upstream and potential p limitation in the middle reach the distribution of n and p could well explain the distinct regional distribution of nutrient limitation in xiangxi bay although n2 addition n2 and n2 p was not conducted in the bioassays at different regions the concurrent nutrient addition bioassay in xx06 fig 5d indicated that n2 addition has no effect on the algal growth the regional distribution of nutrient limitation during the flood season in 2020 was in contrast to the previous studies as p limitation was proven to exist in the whole xiangxi bay in early august 2020 fig 6 which showed a more extensive area of p limitation 4 2 the influence of extreme rainfall during flood season on p limitation in a tributary of the tgr the intensity and occurrence of rainfall events have increased significantly under the influence of climatic changes taking place lehmann et al 2015 giorgi et al 2019 it was reported that extreme rainfall events are occurring more frequently and the annual rainfall showed an increasing tendency in the tgr lü et al 2018 zhu et al 2021 typically the precipitation in the whole yangtze river basin was very abundant during flood season in 2020 and the peak discharge of the flood in the tgr has broken historical records fig 3 second only to 1954 the monthly rainfall of june and july in xiangxi bay was about 1 6 times than the average monthly rainfall over ten years 2007 2016 fig 2 characteristics of rainfall and its frequency distribution in a river basin play an important role in the nutrient input to the ecosystem it could significantly affect the nutrient concentration and stoichiometric ratios tn tp through direct atmospheric deposition and runoff nonpoint source pollution elser et al 2009 camarero and catalan 2012 xiong and hoyer 2018 thus driving the variation of nutrient limitation of phytoplankton growth as show previously the nutrient limitation of algal growth shift from n2 to p limitation in the early flood season and the p limitation persist until late september in the tributary of the tgr the nutrient limitation variation during the flood season was well supported by the variation of tn tp concentration and tn tp which could be affected by increasing the extreme rainfall first the increasing precipitation and runoff may bring more n load input to the water ecosystem and could exacerbate eutrophication sinha et al 2017 huang et al 2020 in particular agricultural watersheds are vulnerable to the impact of precipitation wet deposition under the influence of human activities e g n fertilizer applications increase the n concentration thus may lead to a shift from n limitation to p limitation williams et al 2017 which has also been verified in lake dianchi zhan et al 2017 wet deposition of the tgr indicated that the concentration of nh3 n was much higher than no3 n which may be related to ammonia emission from farmland in the reservoir basin zhang et al 2020b we measured the nutrient concentrations in the rainfall several times in july and verified this finding table s3 this can be more conducive to the rapid alleviation of n2 limitation and shift to p limitation in the early flood season which supported the results of our bioassays secondly we observed a dramatic decrease of the proportion of total dissolved phosphorus to tp tdp tp in flood season in 2020 fig s3 and the decreasing trend of tp during the flood season fig 4c this could further explain the observed intensive p limitation in 2020 among them that the suspended particles might play an important potential role many researches demonstrated that particle phosphorus pp could reach more than 90 of tp loss from farmland to the surrounding water carried by rainfall runoff bah et al 2020 the concentration of srp could not increase parallel with the corresponding rainfall davis et al 2015 higher concentration of suspended particles in the mainstream of the tgr with higher ability to adsorb dissolved p and particle settling tang et al 2018 wu et al 2021 may present a dilution effect for p concentration of the tributaries especially the dissolved p through density currents han et al 2018 yang et al 2018a leading to the reduction of p supply especially srp of the tributary in general the increase of rainfall intensity and frequency will increase the tn tp of the whole ecosystem and thus intensify of p limitation on the whole bay finally our bioassay in late september showed a recovery of n2 limitation and an alleviation of p limitation fig 5f this can be attributed to a decrease in rainfall from august to september followed by an increase in tp and a decrease in tn tp from the end of september to october fig 2 and fig 4 in addition the p limitation alleviation could be attributed to the initial impoundment of the tgr in mid september the variation of stratified density currents in the process of impoundment fig s5 will increase water exchange between mainstream and the tributaries zhao et al 2016 weaken the water temperature stratification in tributaries and destroy the appropriate environment for algae growth liu et al 2012 chuo et al 2019 which will help to reduce the algal blooms and accelerate the accumulation of nutrients comprehensively to ease nutrient limitation however nutrients input accompanied by the increasing extreme rainfall and flooding are not always leading to the variation of nutrient limitation the variation of tn tp and shift of nutrient limitation mainly driven by internal nutrient cycling e g seasonal p release from sediments in shallow eutrophication lakes such as lake taihu and chaohu paerl et al 2011 ding et al 2018 tong et al 2021 in contrast our study in the tributaries of the tgr supported that the variation of tn tp caused by the increasing of extreme rainfall and flooding is the main driving factor of the nutrient limitation succession in external nutrient inputs dominated systems this will be helpful to better identify the nutrient limitation and develop more scientific nutrient management under the climatic change 4 3 nutrient threshold needed to control for phytoplankton growth under extreme rainfall in flood season the flood season is a high occurrence season of algal blooms in the tributary bays of the tgr which is dominanted by cyanophyta and chlorophyta with cryptophyta or bacillariophyta as sub dominants wang et al 2011 chuo et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 similar dominant species of algal blooms occurred throughout our study during the flood season 2020 microcystis spp belong to cyanophyta as the dominant species with the highest initial frequency of occurrence species such as chlorella sp belong to chlorophyta and chroomonas acuta cryptomonas erosa belonging to the cryptophyta more appeared from late july to early august fig s6 to alleviate eutrophication and reduce the risk of algal bloom determining the nutrient threshold is the important foundation to clear reduction target in nutrient management strategies huo et al 2015 cao et al 2017 short term in situ dilution bioassays can identify the response of phytoplankton growth under nutrient reductions and thus can provide a reference for the nutrient threshold needed to control eutrophication paerl et al 1978 xu et al 2015a in our dilution bioassay the concentration of tn and tp that can limit algal growth and algal bloom are approximately 0 55 mg l and 0 057 mg l respectively the bioassays also indicated a significant p limitation in addition growth curve fig 9 in responses to daily n and p of varied concentrations additions indicating that the growth of algae could not be controlled until the concentration of spr below 0 03 0 04 mg l xu et al 2015a zeng et al 2016 in consideration of the average proportion of spr to tp during the flood season 2020 was about 47 estimated the threshold of tp needed to control eutrophication is about 0 064 mg l furthermore the maximum growth rate of algae can be restricted only when the n pulse nutrient addition concentration was controlled lower than 0 1 mg l due to obvious p limitation during the bioassay and original relatively abundant n thus the growth curve of n gradient controlled may not be representative many relevant studies have been carried out to determine the nutrient threshold to protect the ecosystems from excessive nutrient enrichment and algal blooms carleton et al 2009 chambers et al 2012 chen et al 2018 the concentration of tn and tp was recommended to be controlled under 0 8 mg l and 0 061 mg l respectively to prevent excessive cyanobacteria bloom in deep water greater than3 1 m lakes and reservoirs in the u s yuan and pollard 2015 and below 0 80 mg l and 0 05 mg l respectively to limit the growth of microcystis in lake taihu xu et al 2015a our bioassays showed that the control threshold of tn is about 0 55 mg l and tp is 0 057 0 064 mg l to alleviate eutrophication and reduce algal bloom chl a 30 μg l on the typical tributaries of the tgr the control threshold of tp concentration is similar to those freshwater systems while tn is relatively stricter possibly due to the intensified p limitation as the increasing tn tp and the originally severe overloaded n on the reservoir during the flood season xiang et al 2021 how to alleviate water eutrophication and reduce algal blooms is a global concern raising important scientific issue ho et al 2019 gobler 2020 the reduction of the nutrient load input is the most fundamental method to control algal bloom though it requires a long time to achieve which also applies to the tributaries of the tgr yang et al 2018a our results of the nutrient threshold of tn and tp can provide a reference for managers to set scientific nutrient management goals for alleviating eutrophication in the whole basin and formulate corresponding pollution load reduction measures in addition we recommend that p could be priority control relative to n especially in the context of increasing rainfall and flood as the incidence and intensity of the p limitation have increased in tributaries of the tgr li et al 2019 huang et al 2020 and the relatively economical way to remove from the water nevertheless the process of nutrient limitation succession also emphasizes the important role of n in algal growth n limitation or n and p co limitation indicating the need for n control which also can reduce the adverse effects of the reduced imbalance of n and p on the downstream ecosystems paerl et al 2018 besides high n concentration has been reported to lead to higher microcystin concentrations in water ecosystems davis et al 2015 thus we confirmed that implementing dual nutrient input controls over the long term will be more effective finally we recommend that long term determinations of nutrient limitation and nutrient threshold will be needed to control algal growth as a series of complex reactions of the aquatic ecosystems will respond to nutrient structure variation caused by the increasing impact of human activities further to take hydraulic retention time transparency phytoplankton composition etc comprehensively to determine the nutrient threshold for algal blooms control vuorio et al 2020 zou et al 2020 as well as the impact of future climate change increasing extreme rainfall global warming and rising atmospheric co2 etc on the standard of nutrient threshold and regularly improve the nutrient management solution will be more advantageous o neil et al 2012 huo et al 2019 wang et al 2020 5 conclusion the present study reports the characteristics and causes of the temporal and spatial distribution of nutrient limitations in a tributary bay of the tgr during flood season in 2020 as well as the nutrient thresholds needed to control eutrophication and reduce algal blooms nutrient limitation shift from n2 to p limitation then back to the main n2 limitation during the flood season the reduction of dissolved p accompanied by an increase of tn tp caused by the increasing rainfall and flooding intensified p limitation of algal growth of the whole bay the reduction of rainfall and the process of impoundment after the flood season combined to alleviate the p limitation the variation of tn tp caused by the increasing of rainfall and flooding could be the main driving factor of the nutrient limitation shift in external nutrient inputs dominated systems thus short term variation of nutrient limitation need be considered to develop more scientific nutrient management under the influence of climate change particularly in external nutrient inputs dominated systems nutrient dilution and enrichment bioassays indicated that algal blooms could be controlled chl a 30 μg l when the concentrations of tn and tp were lower than 0 55 mg l and 0 057 0 064 mg l respectively the control threshold of tn is relatively stricter possibly due to the intensified p limitation as the increasing tn tp and the severe overloaded n on the reservoir during the flood season thus more relates research is needed to verify this threshold p could be priority control short term while a long term nutrient management of the whole basin needs a dual control of n and p further we recommend sustained attention on nutrient limitation and long term determinations of nutrient threshold needed to control algal blooms as well as more comprehensive factors taken into consideration the present study is helpful to further understand the responses of algal growth to nutrient dynamics and can provide a reference for scientific nutrient management strategy declaration
