19085,septic systems inherently rely on microbial communities in the septic tank and leach field to attenuate pollution from household sewage operating conditions of septic leach field systems especially the degree of water saturation are likely to impact microbial biogeochemical cycling including carbon c nitrogen n and phosphorus p as well as greenhouse gas ghg emissions to the atmosphere to study the impact of flooding on microbial methane ch4 and nutrient cycling two leach field soil columns were constructed one system was operated as designed and the other was operated in both flooded and well maintained conditions ch4 emissions were significantly higher in flooded soils with means between 0 047 and 0 33 g ch4 m 2 d 1 as compared to well drained soils means between 0 0025 and 0 004 g ch4 m 2 d 1 subsurface ch4 profiles were also elevated under flooded conditions and peaked near the wastewater inlet gene abundances of mcra a biomarker for methanogens were also greatest near the wastewater inlet in contrast gene abundances of pmoa a biomarker for methanotrophs were greatest in surface soils at the interface of ch4 produced subsurface and atmospheric oxygen 16s rrna mcra and pmoa amplicon library sequencing revealed microbial community structure in the soil columns differed from that of the original soils and was driven largely by ch4 fluxes and soil vwc additionally active microbial populations differed from those present at the gene level flooding did not appear to affect n or p removals in the soil columns between 75 and 99 removal cod removal was variable throughout the experiment and was negatively impacted by flooding our study shows septic system leach field soils are dynamic environments where ch4 and nutrients are actively cycled by microbial populations our results suggest proper siting installation and routine maintenance of leach field systems is key to reducing the overall impact of these systems on water and air quality graphical abstract image 1 keywords septic leach field system wastewater methane methanogen methanotrophs onsite wastewater treatment owts 1 introduction the world health organization who estimates 1 in 6 people globally rely on septic systems to treat domestic wastewater on site who et al 2017 inexpensive solutions for on site wastewater treatment owts such as septic systems are popular in low resource areas where they account for 56 of on site improved sanitation in urban settings and 38 in rural settings who et al 2017 decentralized systems are also prevalent in the u s and europe where approximately 25 of u s and 26 of european households rely on septic systems us epa 2012 williams et al 2012 septic systems can achieve treatment levels comparable to larger energy intensive wastewater treatment plants while maintaining many of the same public health and environmental benefits usepa 2002 despite the popularity of these low cost owtss little is known about their impact on the environment specifically how failing septic leach field systems impact both air and water quality is poorly understood because septic systems require infrequent service and are inconspicuous by nature failures can remain unnoticed and un repaired failing systems causing ground and or surface water contamination can be difficult to identify and diagnose few permitting agencies in the u s and europe conduct inspections of systems after installation withers et al 2014 consequently the number of failing septic systems in the u s and europe is unknown and even less data on system failures is available for low resource countries currently there are no requirements for states in the u s to collect data on septic system failures and those that do create their own definition of failure ranging from sewage back up to surface and or ground water contamination usepa 2002 many leach field systems fail by flooding due to improper installation in locations with poorly draining soils steep slopes or high ground water tables usepa 2002 several studies have examined septic systems impact on groundwater however to our knowledge no previous work has compared the air and water quality impacts of a failing system to those of a well maintained system cogger and carlile 1984 katz et al 2011 richards et al 2016 withers et al 2014 in terms of greenhouse gas ghg emissions well maintained septic systems have been estimated to release between 0 22 and 0 27 tonne co2 equivalents co2e capita 1 year 1 to the environment with leach field emissions representing roughly 20 of those emissions diaz valbuena et al 2011 truhlar et al 2016 the percentage of failing systems in the u s could range anywhere from 0 5 to 70 by state based on a usepa 2002 report while in europe estimates based on watershed surveys suggest failures are as high as 70 withers et al 2014 if systems fail at the high end of these estimates their contributions to ghg emissions as well as their impacts on groundwater could be significantly greater than previously thought leach field systems rely on soil microbial communities to remove nutrients from septic effluent and as a consequence serve to prevent eutrophication of down gradient waterways additionally these communities may be responsible for significant mitigation of ghg emissions mainly in the form of methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o from septic systems microorganisms involved in ch4 production methanogens and consumption methanotrophs can be studied using the functional genes mcra and pmoa respectively and have previously been shown to correlate with ch4 emission patterns from soil systems freitag et al 2010 lee et al 2014 flooded leach field soils likely support microbial communities distinct from those of a well maintained system which may lead to significant differences in observed ch4 emissions as we attempt to better evaluate owtss it is important to determine how failing systems impact air and water quality the objective of this study was to compare two lab scale septic leach field soil columns under either well maintained or flooded operation in four categories 1 measured surface ch4 fluxes 2 measured subsurface ch4 concentration profiles 3 distribution and activity of key microbial populations with a particular focus on those involved in ch4 cycling 4 measured effectiveness at removing nutrients from wastewater c n p 2 methods 2 1 soil column construction two soil columns were designed to meet the minimum spacing requirements specified in the new york state department of health and bureau of water supply protection s onsite wastewater treatment systems design manual 2012 fig 1 soil columns were constructed in august 2015 from a 1 2 m section of pvc pipe schedule 80 8 cm id filled with soil excavated from an operational leach field system site 7 in fernández baca et al 2018 and truhlar et al 2016 the leach field system had well draining soils and had been operational for 10 years with no history of flooding and no observed biomat at the time of excavation representative samples were taken for soils above and below the leach field lateral and submitted to cornell nutrient analysis laboratory cnal for analysis soils were relatively dry loam silt loam with circumneutral ph and bulk densities of 1 19 and 1 39 g ml 1 for above and below the lateral respectively si table s1 the top 24 cm of soil were collected intact from above the existing leach field system approximately 5 cm of gravel was then back filled into the column before inserting the dosing system the wastewater dosing structure hereafter referred to as the inlet was constructed from a 2 5 cm id pvc pipe with 0 64 cm holes drilled 5 cm apart the structure was inserted through a pre dilled hole in the soil column and caulked to prevent leaks an additional 15 cm of gravel was added to mimic the construction of an in field leach field system to ensure the soil column microbial communities were acclimated to receiving septic tank effluent they were back filled with soil excavated from below the laterals of the operational system rhizon pore water samplers rhizosphere cat no 19 21 23f were inserted at approximately 7 6 23 46 71 and 100 cm below the soil surface fig 1 soil volumetric water content vwc was continuously monitored with ec 5 soil moisture sensors decagon devices cat no 40593 inserted at 15 cm and 64 cm below the soil surface above and below the inlet respectively using the em 50 5 channel data logger for data collection decagon devices cat no 40800 2 2 soil column operation soil columns were dosed with a synthetic wastewater mix si table s2 adapted from aiyuk and verstraete 2004 to achieve a waste stream chemically comparable to septic tank effluent based on reported effluent characteristics in cooper et al 2015 the synthetic wastewater did not have large particulate matter but had total suspended solids tss of approximately 200 mg l 1 low tss is expected in settled water leaving the septic tank and cooper et al 2015 reported tss values between 18 and 89 mg l 1 for septic effluent although the synthetic wastewater has higher tss the particle size distribution is likely more homogenous than authentic effluent with lower mean particle sizes leading to greater infiltration in the soil columns wastewater was sparged with n2 for 1 h and stored in a sealed collapsible 10 l carboy under an n2 headspace at 4 c in the dark immediately adjacent to the soil columns both soil columns received wastewater through the inlet using computer controlled peristaltic pumps and were operated as either flooded or well maintained systems fig 1 experimental columns were operated from august 2015 until august 2016 13 months and were dosed 6 times daily for a total of 103 5 ml d 1 approximately 24 4 l m 2 d 1 representing a daily cod load of 62 1 mg cod d 1 the systems were operated within the dosing range of typical leach field systems specified by new york state which range from 18 3 to 48 9 l m 2 d 1 nys depart of health 2012 peristaltic pumps were used to pump out effluent via a 1 3 cm hole drilled at the bottom of the column fitted with a push to connect and collected in 1 l nalgene bottles in the first phase of monitoring referred to hereafter as phase i february 2016 to august 2016 column a was operated under continuously flooded conditions while column b was well maintained this was achieved by dosing wastewater until there was visible pooling at the soil surface in both columns at which point the effluent pump was turned on for column b only to drain the system until vwc in the shallow sensor registered dry soils 0 1 m3 m 3 in phase ii starting august 2016 the water table in column b was increased to mimic the flooded conditions in column a by continuously pumping wastewater into column b until flooding was observed at the soil surface both columns were remained flooded for 6 months in phase iii starting february 2017 column b was drained over a period of several months returning to a well maintained state 2 3 surface methane flux measurements soil flux measurements were taken following a modified field flux chamber method established by molodovskaya et al 2011 briefly pvc caps fitted to the soil columns were adapted to hold a septum for gas sampling as well as a 23 gauge needle to provide headspace venting after caps were placed over each column 5 ml headspace gas samples were taken through the septa every 10 min for 30 min and injected into pre sealed 9 ml vials gas samples were analyzed within 12 h via gas chromatography using a flame ionization detector hewlett packard 5890 series and a 2 4 m long 3 10 cm id 60 80 carbopack b column supelco gas fluxes were determined by fitting a linear regression to ch4 concentrations over time the regression slope was taken as the rate of gas flux and was then divided by the soil column surface area for a per m2 flux rate boxplots used to visualize flux data define the inter quartile range iqr as between 25 and 75 of data outliers were defined as measurements less than or greater than 1 5 times the iqr and were not included in testing significance as they likely represent ebullition events t tests were used test significance of observed differences in ch4 emissions between operation phases for each column using a 95 confidence interval 2 4 influent effluent and pore water sampling influent effluent and pore water samples were taken biweekly influent was sampled by switching the position of a 3 way valve leading to each inlet to allow sample collection in 15 ml centrifuge tubes fresh effluent samples were collected directly from the 1 l nalgene bottles 10 ml pore water samples were collected via the installed samplers at each depth fig 1 all water samples were filtered and stored at 4 c for later nutrient analysis pore water dissolved ch4 concentrations were measured immediately after sampling by injecting 5 ml of sample into a pre sealed 9 ml vial shaking for 5 min and sampling the headspace for gc fid analysis dissolved ch4 concentrations were back calculated using henry s constant for ch4 partitioning in water at room temperature 25 c all water samples were analyzed for ammonium nh4 nitrate nitrite no3 and no2 soluble reactive phosphorus po4 3 and chemical oxygen demand cod nutrient concentrations were determined using published colorimetric assays modified for a tecan infinite m200 pro microplate reader ammonium bower and holm hansen 1980 nitrate nitrite miranda et al 2001 srp apha 2012 influent and effluent samples were analyzed for cod removal using the chemetrics kit cat no k 7365 all samples were analyzed in duplicate and monthly averages were calculated for each column influent and effluent 2 5 soil sampling nucleic acid extractions and qpcr soils were sampled three times throughout the experiment within a 3 cm vertical distance of each pore water sampler a flame sterilized drill bit was used to drill through the pvc to take soil samples with a sterile 0 3 cm diameter corer approximately 6 cm long after sampling the hole was flushed with n2 gas to displace ambient oxygen and sealed with a rubber stopper then caulked to ensure a water and air tight seal soil samples were manually homogenized and subsampled for duplicate nucleic acid extractions and gravimetric dry weight determination nucleic acids were extracted using the rneasy powersoil total rna kit and rneasy powersoil dna elution kit qiagen approximately 2 g of soil were extracted following the manufacturer s protocol all samples were spiked with 4 μl of 1 109 copies μl 1 of luciferase rna promega as an internal control prior to cell lysis dna was quantified using the quant it picogreen dsdna assay molecular probes eugene or and quality checked with a nanodrop spectrophotometer nanodrop nd 1000 thermoscientific waltham ma following rna isolation the rq1 rnase free dnase kit promega was used to remove contaminating dna following manufacturer s instructions rna concentrations were measured using the quant it rna assay kit invitrogen cdna was synthesized from the dnase treated rna using the advanced iscript cdna synthesis kit bio rad according to manufacturer s instructions qpcr reactions were run in triplicate using a total reaction volume of 25 μl each reaction was comprised of 2x iq sybr green supermix bio rad 17 5 pmol of primer and 3 μl of template dna with diluted concentrations of approximately 10 ng μl 1 thermal cycling was conducted on an icycler iq bio rad following published protocols for the selected primers for mcra pmoa and 16s rrna genes si table s3 costello and lidstrom 1999 ferris et al 1996 luton et al 2002 steinberg and regan 2009 quantification analysis was done using ct values from the icycler iq software melt curve analyses were conducted on all products and a subset of samples was sent for sanger sequencing to confirm amplification of target genes data not shown 2 6 illumina sequencing of 16s rrna mcra and pmoa libraries duplicate dna samples from each column at the 7 6 cm depth from two sampling dates were selected for high throughput sequencing community analysis gene amplicon libraries for mcra and pmoa were created using the qpcr primers with added adapters for illumina sequencing compatibility 16s rrna amplicon libraries were created by amplifying the hypervariable v3 v4 region using the universal primers s d bact 0341 b s 17 s d bact 0785 a a 21 klindworth et al 2013 dna samples from the original leach field and control soils at the same depth were also sequenced for comparison to the soil column communities additionally duplicate cdna samples from each column at the 7 6 cm depth were sequenced to examine the active microbial populations in the soil columns the qubit dsdna high sensitivity assay life technologies carlsbad ca usa was used to measure amplicon concentrations for a randomly sampled subset of reactions samples were submitted to cornell university biotechnology resource center for barcoding pooling and paired end 2 250 bp sequencing on the miseq platform illumina san diego ca usa 2 7 analyses of 16s rrna mcra and pmoa amplicon libraries resulting 16s rrna mcra and pmoa sequencing data was processed as described in fernández baca et al 2018 16s rrna sequencing data was analyzed using qiime v 1 9 1 and the greengenes reference database v 13 8 august 2013 functional gene sequence analyses were done with bwa mem and a curated reference database from fungene caporaso et al 2010 fernández baca et al 2018 fish et al 2013 li 2013 mcdonald et al 2012 alpha diversity was measured using both chao1 and shannon diversity indices shannon 1948 wilkins et al 2015 principal coordinate analysis pcoa and constrained distance based redundancy analysis dbrda plots were created with r version 3 3 3 using the phyloseq version 1 19 1 and vegan version 2 4 4 packages and the weighted unifrac distance matrix variance inflation factors were checked for dbrda constraining parameters vif 5 and for significance p 0 01 based on anova 3 results 3 1 soil volumetric water content soil vwc was monitored throughout the sampling period above and below the inlet fig 2 from august 2015 to february 2016 the start up phase vwc was monitored until measurements stabilized and during this time no other samples were taken phase i began after measurements stabilized during this phase column a was flooded and vwc was maintained at or above 0 26 m3 m 3 mean of 0 326 and 0 294 m3 m 3 at 15 cm and 64 cm below the surface respectively column a remained flooded for the duration of the experiment through all phases of operation in contrast column b shallow 15 cm depth soils were dry mean of 0 114 m3 m 3 during phase i and deep soils 64 cm depth were saturated mean of 0 316 m3 m 3 in phase ii column b mean vwc increased to 0 30 m3 m 3 in both shallow and deep soils confirming flooded conditions column b was drained over several months in phase iii after march 2017 there were occasional spikes in the shallow sensor for column b indicating intermittent flooding however after mid june the vwc sensors showed column b had consistently drier soils means of 0 169 and 0 146 m3 m 3 for shallow and deep soil respectively 3 2 atmospheric ch4 emissions ch4 emissions varied over the two year operation period fig 3 during phases i and iii column a had higher ch4 emissions than b fig 3a and c while in phase ii they had comparable ch4 emissions fig 3b ch4 emissions ranged in column a from a mean of 0 11 g ch4 m 2 d 1 in phase i to a mean of 0 20 g ch4 m 2 d 1 in phase ii finally dropping to 0 047 g ch4 m 2 d 1 in phase iii however none of these differences were significant p 0 1 between all phases in column b phase i and iii had average ch4 emissions close to zero means fluxes of 0 004 and 0 0025 g ch4 m 2 d 1 but in phase ii emissions were significantly higher mean 0 33 g ch4 m 2 d 1 as compared to phase i and iii p 0 046 and 0 044 respectively 3 3 subsurface ch4 concentration profiles ch4 depth profiles of the two soil columns evolved over the course of the experiment fig 4 during phase i subsurface ch4 concentrations ranged from atmospheric to a peak of 15 8 mg l 1 in column a and 0 637 mg l 1 in column b fig 4a during phase ii in column b average monthly methane concentrations 46 cm below the surface increased steadily from 1 87 to 9 28 mg l 1 while in column a peak subsurface ch4 concentrations ranged from 5 18 to 17 5 mg l 1 in the same time period fig 4b in phase iii column b was drained and methane concentrations above the inlet dropped over time to atmospheric while below the inlet peak methane concentrations remained high with observed concentrations between 1 3 and 12 3 mg l 1 from march to august 2017 fig 4c 3 4 mcra pmoa and 16s rrna gene and transcript abundances gene abundances of 16s rrna mcra and pmoa varied across sampling dates and with depth fig 5 mcra gene copies were highest near the wastewater inlet in both columns with abundances up to 7 11 107 and 2 07 107 mcra copies g 1 dry weight soil soildw for column a and b respectively the lowest mcra gene abundances were observed in surface soil samples 0 and 8 cm in contrast the highest observed pmoa gene abundances occurred in surface samples up to 1 99 108 and 5 80 107 copies g 1 soildw for column a and b respectively and decreased with depth 16s rrna gene copies followed a similar pattern with greater abundances near the surface and decreasing with depth transcript abundances of mcra and pmoa were used to estimate the activity of ch4 cycling microorganisms while 16s rrna transcript quantification was used to estimate baseline microbial activity fig 6 both 16s rrna and pmoa transcript abundances showed similar trends to gene abundances where the highest observed transcript levels were found in near surface soils and decreased with depth results for mcra showed methanogen activity was not necessarily restricted to soils surrounding the inlet but occurred throughout the soil column depth ratios of mcra to pmoa gene abundances were compared to mean monthly subsurface concentrations of ch4 for each of the three sampling dates si fig s1 a significant positive relationship between log10 mcra pmoa gene abundances and log10 mean monthly ch4 concentrations mg l 1 was found for one sampling date in column b r2 0 829 p 0 0318 weak positive correlations were observed for all other sampling dates r2 ranging from 0 23 to 0 65 and p values between 0 110 and 0 414 additionally weak positive relationships were observed between ch4 concentrations and ratios of mcra pmoa transcript abundances however again these correlations were not significant at a 95 confidence interval si fig s2 3 5 16s rrna mcra and pmoa amplicon library sequencing 16s rrna sequencing data was quality filtered and low quality sequences were removed resulting in a total of 105 113 reads mean assigned reads per sample for dna was 12 502 ranging from 6706 to 17 672 and for cdna was 6838 ranging from 21 to 14 422 with a median read length of 444 bp singleton otus were removed resulting in 17 492 unique otus pcoa and constrained dbrda plots were created to visualize variations in microbial community structure at the dna level fig 7 pcoa revealed samples clustered together based on treatment i e column a b and original soil the dbrda constraining parameters surface ch4 flux and soil vwc explained approximately 79 of the variation observed in the unconstrained plot pc1 22 7 and pc2 11 2 an additional pcoa plot was used to examine differences in community diversity between gene and transcript libraries si fig s3 which revealed the microbial communities in the columns diverged even more at the transcript level functional gene sequencing of mcra and pmoa amplicon libraries was further used to study ch4 cycling populations sequencing results for mcra and pmoa amplicon libraries were varied with more total reads assigned for mcra 87 979 than for pmoa 853 mean mapped reads per sample was 12 242 for mcra and 420 for pmoa samples methanogen diversity in the experimental columns and original soils was studied using the mcra amplicon libraries at the family and genus level fig 8 a and si fig s4a relative abundance of methanosaetaceae increased in column a 39 of reads as compared to column b 14 of reads and the original soils 12 1 and 17 4 for leach and control soils respectively methanotroph populations were examined using the functional gene pmoa at both the family and genus level fig 8b and si fig s4b methylococcaceae and methylocystaceae type i and type ii methanotroph families respectively dominated both soil columns and original soils with column a having a relatively greater number of reads associated with methylocystaceae 54 of reads mapped to this family as compared to column b and original soils less than 15 of mapped reads per sample a large fraction of reads from column b 30 and the original leach field soils 16 were assigned to candidate division nc10 phylum organisms which are thought to couple methane oxidation to nitrite reduction luesken et al 2011 in the 16s rrna sequencing data loss of methanotroph diversity in column a is evident at the genus level where type ii methylocystis and methylobacter make up more than 80 of the assigned reads and the type i methanotroph methylomicrobium has disappeared si fig s5 chao1 and the shannon diversity values calculated from the 16s rrna sequencing data indicate that the original soils had the greatest observed diversity with chao1 values of 8787 and 9559 and shannon values of 7 55 and 7 59 for original control and leach field soils respectively column b had a chao1 value of 8239 and shannon index of 7 37 while column a had the lowest calculated diversity 5371 and 6 74 for chao1 and shannon respectively 3 6 nutrient and cod removal influent and effluent concentrations of nh4 po4 3 and cod were compared for flooded and well maintained soil columns fig 9 removal for both nh4 and po4 3 appears to be unaffected by flooding however nh4 removal did decline during column b s transition period from flooded to well maintained conditions nitrate and nitrite were produced at low levels in both columns and ranged from 0 to 15 mg l 1 as n cod removal was variable but higher in column b 75 removal prior to flooding as compared to column a 25 removal and declined after flooding nutrient concentrations were also measured with depth data not shown and peak concentrations for nh4 po4 3 and nitrate and nitrite were observed near the inlet decreasing with depth 4 discussion 4 1 ch4 cycling in leach field soil columns ch4 emissions from column b during well maintained operation phases i and iii were comparable to well maintained leach field systems measured in central new york which range from low rate net ch4 consuming 0 004 g ch4 m 2 d 1 to net emitting sites 0 005 g ch4 m 2 d 1 truhlar et al 2016 under flooded conditions the soil columns exhibited increased ch4 emissions compared to non flooded conditions and had emissions similar to those observed in flooded leach field soils measured in summer of 2014 mean 0 26 g ch4 m 2 d 1 fernández baca et al 2018 ebullition events observed during the flooded phases of operation had peak rates of 1 45 and 1 71 g ch4 m 2 d 1 for column a and b respectively and were comparable to emissions from traditionally flooded soils such as rice paddies 0 24 1 44 g ch4 m 2 d 1 and peat bogs 0 21 0 4 g ch4 m 2 d 1 indicating ghg emissions from leach fields could be significantly higher than previously thought deppe et al 2010 freitag et al 2010 lee et al 2014 subsurface ch4 profiles evolved over time with changes in soil vwc in phase i column b accumulated low amounts of ch4 at depth in contrast column a had ch4 concentrations between 5 and 20 mg ch4 l 1 during phase ii the two columns exhibited similar ch4 depth profiles with peak concentrations occurring near the inlet and decreasing both above and below subsurface ch4 concentrations in rice paddy and pasture soils have previously been shown to peak below surface between 8 and 40 cm deep and decrease with depth this pattern may be attributed to a combination of upward diffusion and low or no production of ch4 in deeper mineral soils chamberlain et al 2016 lee et al 2015 vaksmaa et al 2017 similarly in the experimental columns a combination of diffusion and microbial ch4 oxidation likely explain the low ch4 concentration in shallow soils high soil vwc has been correlated to increased ch4 emissions in soil environments as varied as pastures roadside storm water ditches and bogs chamberlain et al 2016 deppe et al 2010 mcphillips et al 2016 truhlar et al 2016 estimated the leach field of well maintained systems in central new york had a mean ch4 flux of 0 0196 g m 2 d 1 this study suggests a flooded system could have peak emissions 100 times greater thus proper installation and continued maintenance of septic system leach fields is essential to reducing net ghg emissions from these systems 4 2 ch4 cycling community composition methanogens and methanotrophs were present throughout both soil columns but had distinct depth profiles methanogens were more abundant near the wastewater inlet as indicated by greater mcra gene copies and less abundant both above and below although angel et al 2012 showed that certain methanogen species are robust to oxygen exposure we found that our lowest mcra gene abundances were observed at the surface 0 2 5 cm depth however at the transcript level we found that methanogens were active in near surface soils as suggested by the 1 5 2 fold higher mcra transcript levels observed in surface soils as compared to deeper soils below 23 cm in contrast methanotroph populations were more abundant near surface and became less abundant with depth lee et al 2015 and reim et al 2012 observed similar profiles in flooded rice paddy soils where methanotroph abundances were highest in near surface soil at the interface of oxygen methane gradients as o2 availability decreases aerobic methanotroph populations also declined even as ch4 concentrations increased suggesting that soil methanotroph populations are driven largely by o2 availability oxygen concentrations were measured several times during phase ii in this study data not shown and were found to be below detection dissolved oxygen detection limit was 0 025 mg o2 l 1 below the 8 cm depth thus decreasing o2 concentrations between the 8 and 23 cm depths may be responsible for the decline in methanotroph populations with depth mcra and pmoa gene abundances have previously been correlated to ch4 production potential in rice paddies and peat bogs freitag et al 2010 ma et al 2013 2012 we explored similar biomarker abundance to ch4 emission relationships in the leach field soil columns using log 10 of mcra pmoa gene or transcript abundances and mean monthly ch4 concentrations at each sampling depth si figs s1 and s2 moderately strong correlations were found between r2 of 0 230 and 0 829 indicating a positive relationship between the biomarker gene ratio and ch4 concentrations however the observed relationship was only significant for samples from january 2017 in column b r2 0 829 p 0 0318 this relationship appears to be driven in large part by mcra gene abundances which alone was significantly correlated to ch4 concentrations for the january 2017 sampling date r2 0 810 p 0 0386 whereas pmoa gene abundances showed no significant correlations for any date the link between biomarker abundances and ch4 potential may be obscured by differences in pore water and soil sample volumes soil samples were taken over a relatively small volume approximately 0 23 cm2 while pore water samplers pulled from a larger volume of soil potentially integrating small volumes of high activity with larger volumes of low activity 4 3 microbial community composition in leach field soils 16s rrna mcra and pmoa libraries were analyzed to characterize the microbial community structure in leach field soils with an emphasis on examining populations controlling ch4 cycling the 16s rrna libraries revealed that communities from the experimental leach field soil columns had diverged from those of the original soils at the dna level this variation was explained in part by soil vwc and ch4 emissions of the soil columns fig 7 soil microbial communities from original control and leach field soils were more similar to each other than either column a or b at the gene level at the transcript level greater divergence in community structure was observed indicating that active microbial populations differ from those present at the gene level si fig s3 krause et al 2010 observed a similar disparity between total and active microbial populations when examining methanotroph populations via pmoa gene and transcript abundances in flooded rice paddy soils pmoa amplicon libraries revealed two aerobic methanotroph families were present across all samples methylocystaceae and methylococcaceae methylococcaceae represented the majority of reads in all soil samples with the exception of column a where it accounted for 45 9 of reads this was in contrast to results from 16s rrna libraries si fig s5 which suggested that methylocystaceae was dominant across all samples greater than 85 of reads in all samples loss of methanotroph diversity in column a observed in the pmoa amplicon libraries was supported by 16s rrna sequencing results however family and genus level assignments differed considerably between the two datasets a majority of the16s rrna reads aligned to type ii methanotrophs greater than 75 of reads while in the pmoa library the majority of reads were type i methanotrophs and had a low relative abundance of type ii methanotrophs less than 18 0 in all samples except column a which had 54 1 of reads assigned to type ii lee et al 2014 similarly found that taxonomic affiliations based on pmoa libraries differed from those based on the 16s rrna libraries that could be attributed to primer biases or incomplete gene sequence information in reference databases mcra amplicon libraries revealed methanosaetaceae methanosarcinaceae methanobacteriaceae and methanomassillicoccaceae families combined represented the majority of reads approximately 43 across all soil samples these families as well as methanoregulaceae methanocellaceae and methanospirillaceae have previously been found in soil environments such as rice paddies and wetlands suggesting leach field soils have similar methanogen profiles to other high vwc soils bridgham et al 2013 interestingly mcra libraries revealed the presence of the anaerobic methanotrophic archaea candidatus methanoperedenceae anme 2d clade thought to couple methane oxidation to nitrate reduction in low abundance across all samples haroon et al 2013 column a had the most distinct methanogen profile with a loss of many of the low abundance genera observed in column b and the original soils and an increase in the relative abundance of methanosaeta relative to other genera the decrease in methanogen diversity observed in column a parallels that found in the pmoa and 16s rrna libraries and is supported by statistical diversity indices chao1 and shannon due to primer biases against archaeal sequences reads were sparse for the euryachaeaota phylum 21 total mapped reads in the16s rrna amplicon library and precluded comparisons between mcra and 16s rrna sequencing datasets the use of synthetic wastewater in this study likely impacted the soil microbial community structure in addition to having readily available c sources such as acetate there were no large particles that would be more resistant to microbial attack and could reduce effluent infiltration into soil additionally authentic septic effluent could introduce high numbers of methanogens and to a lesser degree methanotrophs to leach field soils the probable presence of anaerobic methanotrophs in septic tank effluent should also not be disregarded thus in situ leach field systems would have a constant input of methane cycling populations not mimicked in the study system however in situ systems likely reach a steady state in terms of microbial populations that do not fluctuate substantially over time unless there is a significant disturbance such as a change in soil vwc the findings in this study reflect a system that has been substantially disturbed from steady state 4 4 nitrogen phosphorus and cod removal septic systems can impact ground and surface water by leaching high loads of nutrients n and p cod and pathogens richards et al 2016 usepa 2002 in this study the soil columns were able to remove n and p effectively despite flooding both nh4 and po4 3 were removed at greater than 75 efficiency during all operational phases high n and p removals have previously been reported in well maintained leach field systems but had not previously been measured in flooded system gill et al 2009 pell et al 1990 in this study p is likely retained by complexation with aluminum al or iron fe oxides sequences of acidovorax sp and thiobacillus sp which can both oxidize iron anaerobically coupled to nitrate reduction were found in the soil columns indicating potential for fe oxidation creating minerals available for p sorption carlson et al 2013 16s rrna amplicon sequencing also revealed the presence of nitrifier denitrifier and ammonia oxidizing microorganisms indicating full or partial denitrification may be responsible for the high nh4 removals observed reads assigned to nitrifier genera including nitrospira sp were found in both columns with relative abundances of 0 4 and 0 8 for column a and b respectively well known denitrifier genera including pseudomonas bradyrhizobium and rhodanobacter as well as atypical denitrifers including anaeromyxobacter sp sequences were also found albeit at a low relative abundances less than 0 1 in both experimental columns ma et al 2008 sanford et al 2012 assimilation in microbial biomass accounts for a portion of the total n removal from the system however the contradictory results of high n and p removal and apparent low o2 concentrations are surprising to completely oxidize the cod and nutrients in the influent to the levels observed in the effluent more than 30 mg d 1 of o2 would need to be supplied during phase ii some nutrient measurements were taken throughout the profile including no3 si fig s7 which showed production of no3 near the surface 7 6 cm depth and around the inlet 23 46 cm below surface this suggests o2 diffusion from the atmosphere allowing for nitrification near surface additionally the measurements point to the potential of o2 contamination in the wastewater resulting in no3 production near the inlet although the wastewater was purged with n2 and stored in a collapsible carboy some o2 diffusion through the plastic tubing or carboy may occur dissolved o2 measured in the soil column showed concentrations were below detection below the first pore water sampler at 7 6 cm thus any o2 introduced into the soil column via wastewater would have been consumed immediately and may have contributed to oxic cycling of nutrients near the inlet nevertheless it is unclear where and how o2 was introduced into the system in sufficient quantities to completely treat n p and cod to levels observed in this study flooding impacted cod removal suggesting flooded leach fields could introduce high cod loads to nearby ground water furthermore although both n and p had high removals in this study further work should be done to better understand the biogeochemical cycling occurring in these systems as previous studies suggested septic systems can contribute significantly to ground water contamination of n and p bunnell et al 1999 cooper et al 2015 withers et al 2014 thus proper installation of leach field systems with sufficient spacing between laterals and the local ground water table is critical to maintaining high removal efficiencies without impacting nearby ground and or surface water 5 conclusions two lab scale leach field soil columns were constructed to study how flooding impacts ch4 and nutrient cycling in these systems ch4 fluxes and subsurface concentrations increased under failing by flooding conditions indicating soil vwc is a major driver of ch4 production in leach field soils mcra gene copies were greatest near the wastewater inlet in contrast pmoa gene abundances were greatest in surface soils soil column microbial community structure shifted significantly from the original leach field soils at the dna level and was explained by ch4 emissions and soil vwc active microbial populations differed from populations at the gene level suggesting analysis of both gene and transcripts is important to understanding microbial community and ch4 cycling dynamics flooding did not appear to affect nutrient removals however did negatively impact cod removal based on these results we suggest proper maintenance of leach field systems to avoid flooding is essential to mitigating their methane emissions and reducing their

19085,septic systems inherently rely on microbial communities in the septic tank and leach field to attenuate pollution from household sewage operating conditions of septic leach field systems especially the degree of water saturation are likely to impact microbial biogeochemical cycling including carbon c nitrogen n and phosphorus p as well as greenhouse gas ghg emissions to the atmosphere to study the impact of flooding on microbial methane ch4 and nutrient cycling two leach field soil columns were constructed one system was operated as designed and the other was operated in both flooded and well maintained conditions ch4 emissions were significantly higher in flooded soils with means between 0 047 and 0 33 g ch4 m 2 d 1 as compared to well drained soils means between 0 0025 and 0 004 g ch4 m 2 d 1 subsurface ch4 profiles were also elevated under flooded conditions and peaked near the wastewater inlet gene abundances of mcra a biomarker for methanogens were also greatest near the wastewater inlet in contrast gene abundances of pmoa a biomarker for methanotrophs were greatest in surface soils at the interface of ch4 produced subsurface and atmospheric oxygen 16s rrna mcra and pmoa amplicon library sequencing revealed microbial community structure in the soil columns differed from that of the original soils and was driven largely by ch4 fluxes and soil vwc additionally active microbial populations differed from those present at the gene level flooding did not appear to affect n or p removals in the soil columns between 75 and 99 removal cod removal was variable throughout the experiment and was negatively impacted by flooding our study shows septic system leach field soils are dynamic environments where ch4 and nutrients are actively cycled by microbial populations our results suggest proper siting installation and routine maintenance of leach field systems is key to reducing the overall impact of these systems on water and air quality graphical abstract image 1 keywords septic leach field system wastewater methane methanogen methanotrophs onsite wastewater treatment owts 1 introduction the world health organization who estimates 1 in 6 people globally rely on septic systems to treat domestic wastewater on site who et al 2017 inexpensive solutions for on site wastewater treatment owts such as septic systems are popular in low resource areas where they account for 56 of on site improved sanitation in urban settings and 38 in rural settings who et al 2017 decentralized systems are also prevalent in the u s and europe where approximately 25 of u s and 26 of european households rely on septic systems us epa 2012 williams et al 2012 septic systems can achieve treatment levels comparable to larger energy intensive wastewater treatment plants while maintaining many of the same public health and environmental benefits usepa 2002 despite the popularity of these low cost owtss little is known about their impact on the environment specifically how failing septic leach field systems impact both air and water quality is poorly understood because septic systems require infrequent service and are inconspicuous by nature failures can remain unnoticed and un repaired failing systems causing ground and or surface water contamination can be difficult to identify and diagnose few permitting agencies in the u s and europe conduct inspections of systems after installation withers et al 2014 consequently the number of failing septic systems in the u s and europe is unknown and even less data on system failures is available for low resource countries currently there are no requirements for states in the u s to collect data on septic system failures and those that do create their own definition of failure ranging from sewage back up to surface and or ground water contamination usepa 2002 many leach field systems fail by flooding due to improper installation in locations with poorly draining soils steep slopes or high ground water tables usepa 2002 several studies have examined septic systems impact on groundwater however to our knowledge no previous work has compared the air and water quality impacts of a failing system to those of a well maintained system cogger and carlile 1984 katz et al 2011 richards et al 2016 withers et al 2014 in terms of greenhouse gas ghg emissions well maintained septic systems have been estimated to release between 0 22 and 0 27 tonne co2 equivalents co2e capita 1 year 1 to the environment with leach field emissions representing roughly 20 of those emissions diaz valbuena et al 2011 truhlar et al 2016 the percentage of failing systems in the u s could range anywhere from 0 5 to 70 by state based on a usepa 2002 report while in europe estimates based on watershed surveys suggest failures are as high as 70 withers et al 2014 if systems fail at the high end of these estimates their contributions to ghg emissions as well as their impacts on groundwater could be significantly greater than previously thought leach field systems rely on soil microbial communities to remove nutrients from septic effluent and as a consequence serve to prevent eutrophication of down gradient waterways additionally these communities may be responsible for significant mitigation of ghg emissions mainly in the form of methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o from septic systems microorganisms involved in ch4 production methanogens and consumption methanotrophs can be studied using the functional genes mcra and pmoa respectively and have previously been shown to correlate with ch4 emission patterns from soil systems freitag et al 2010 lee et al 2014 flooded leach field soils likely support microbial communities distinct from those of a well maintained system which may lead to significant differences in observed ch4 emissions as we attempt to better evaluate owtss it is important to determine how failing systems impact air and water quality the objective of this study was to compare two lab scale septic leach field soil columns under either well maintained or flooded operation in four categories 1 measured surface ch4 fluxes 2 measured subsurface ch4 concentration profiles 3 distribution and activity of key microbial populations with a particular focus on those involved in ch4 cycling 4 measured effectiveness at removing nutrients from wastewater c n p 2 methods 2 1 soil column construction two soil columns were designed to meet the minimum spacing requirements specified in the new york state department of health and bureau of water supply protection s onsite wastewater treatment systems design manual 2012 fig 1 soil columns were constructed in august 2015 from a 1 2 m section of pvc pipe schedule 80 8 cm id filled with soil excavated from an operational leach field system site 7 in fernández baca et al 2018 and truhlar et al 2016 the leach field system had well draining soils and had been operational for 10 years with no history of flooding and no observed biomat at the time of excavation representative samples were taken for soils above and below the leach field lateral and submitted to cornell nutrient analysis laboratory cnal for analysis soils were relatively dry loam silt loam with circumneutral ph and bulk densities of 1 19 and 1 39 g ml 1 for above and below the lateral respectively si table s1 the top 24 cm of soil were collected intact from above the existing leach field system approximately 5 cm of gravel was then back filled into the column before inserting the dosing system the wastewater dosing structure hereafter referred to as the inlet was constructed from a 2 5 cm id pvc pipe with 0 64 cm holes drilled 5 cm apart the structure was inserted through a pre dilled hole in the soil column and caulked to prevent leaks an additional 15 cm of gravel was added to mimic the construction of an in field leach field system to ensure the soil column microbial communities were acclimated to receiving septic tank effluent they were back filled with soil excavated from below the laterals of the operational system rhizon pore water samplers rhizosphere cat no 19 21 23f were inserted at approximately 7 6 23 46 71 and 100 cm below the soil surface fig 1 soil volumetric water content vwc was continuously monitored with ec 5 soil moisture sensors decagon devices cat no 40593 inserted at 15 cm and 64 cm below the soil surface above and below the inlet respectively using the em 50 5 channel data logger for data collection decagon devices cat no 40800 2 2 soil column operation soil columns were dosed with a synthetic wastewater mix si table s2 adapted from aiyuk and verstraete 2004 to achieve a waste stream chemically comparable to septic tank effluent based on reported effluent characteristics in cooper et al 2015 the synthetic wastewater did not have large particulate matter but had total suspended solids tss of approximately 200 mg l 1 low tss is expected in settled water leaving the septic tank and cooper et al 2015 reported tss values between 18 and 89 mg l 1 for septic effluent although the synthetic wastewater has higher tss the particle size distribution is likely more homogenous than authentic effluent with lower mean particle sizes leading to greater infiltration in the soil columns wastewater was sparged with n2 for 1 h and stored in a sealed collapsible 10 l carboy under an n2 headspace at 4 c in the dark immediately adjacent to the soil columns both soil columns received wastewater through the inlet using computer controlled peristaltic pumps and were operated as either flooded or well maintained systems fig 1 experimental columns were operated from august 2015 until august 2016 13 months and were dosed 6 times daily for a total of 103 5 ml d 1 approximately 24 4 l m 2 d 1 representing a daily cod load of 62 1 mg cod d 1 the systems were operated within the dosing range of typical leach field systems specified by new york state which range from 18 3 to 48 9 l m 2 d 1 nys depart of health 2012 peristaltic pumps were used to pump out effluent via a 1 3 cm hole drilled at the bottom of the column fitted with a push to connect and collected in 1 l nalgene bottles in the first phase of monitoring referred to hereafter as phase i february 2016 to august 2016 column a was operated under continuously flooded conditions while column b was well maintained this was achieved by dosing wastewater until there was visible pooling at the soil surface in both columns at which point the effluent pump was turned on for column b only to drain the system until vwc in the shallow sensor registered dry soils 0 1 m3 m 3 in phase ii starting august 2016 the water table in column b was increased to mimic the flooded conditions in column a by continuously pumping wastewater into column b until flooding was observed at the soil surface both columns were remained flooded for 6 months in phase iii starting february 2017 column b was drained over a period of several months returning to a well maintained state 2 3 surface methane flux measurements soil flux measurements were taken following a modified field flux chamber method established by molodovskaya et al 2011 briefly pvc caps fitted to the soil columns were adapted to hold a septum for gas sampling as well as a 23 gauge needle to provide headspace venting after caps were placed over each column 5 ml headspace gas samples were taken through the septa every 10 min for 30 min and injected into pre sealed 9 ml vials gas samples were analyzed within 12 h via gas chromatography using a flame ionization detector hewlett packard 5890 series and a 2 4 m long 3 10 cm id 60 80 carbopack b column supelco gas fluxes were determined by fitting a linear regression to ch4 concentrations over time the regression slope was taken as the rate of gas flux and was then divided by the soil column surface area for a per m2 flux rate boxplots used to visualize flux data define the inter quartile range iqr as between 25 and 75 of data outliers were defined as measurements less than or greater than 1 5 times the iqr and were not included in testing significance as they likely represent ebullition events t tests were used test significance of observed differences in ch4 emissions between operation phases for each column using a 95 confidence interval 2 4 influent effluent and pore water sampling influent effluent and pore water samples were taken biweekly influent was sampled by switching the position of a 3 way valve leading to each inlet to allow sample collection in 15 ml centrifuge tubes fresh effluent samples were collected directly from the 1 l nalgene bottles 10 ml pore water samples were collected via the installed samplers at each depth fig 1 all water samples were filtered and stored at 4 c for later nutrient analysis pore water dissolved ch4 concentrations were measured immediately after sampling by injecting 5 ml of sample into a pre sealed 9 ml vial shaking for 5 min and sampling the headspace for gc fid analysis dissolved ch4 concentrations were back calculated using henry s constant for ch4 partitioning in water at room temperature 25 c all water samples were analyzed for ammonium nh4 nitrate nitrite no3 and no2 soluble reactive phosphorus po4 3 and chemical oxygen demand cod nutrient concentrations were determined using published colorimetric assays modified for a tecan infinite m200 pro microplate reader ammonium bower and holm hansen 1980 nitrate nitrite miranda et al 2001 srp apha 2012 influent and effluent samples were analyzed for cod removal using the chemetrics kit cat no k 7365 all samples were analyzed in duplicate and monthly averages were calculated for each column influent and effluent 2 5 soil sampling nucleic acid extractions and qpcr soils were sampled three times throughout the experiment within a 3 cm vertical distance of each pore water sampler a flame sterilized drill bit was used to drill through the pvc to take soil samples with a sterile 0 3 cm diameter corer approximately 6 cm long after sampling the hole was flushed with n2 gas to displace ambient oxygen and sealed with a rubber stopper then caulked to ensure a water and air tight seal soil samples were manually homogenized and subsampled for duplicate nucleic acid extractions and gravimetric dry weight determination nucleic acids were extracted using the rneasy powersoil total rna kit and rneasy powersoil dna elution kit qiagen approximately 2 g of soil were extracted

treated rna using the advanced iscript cdna synthesis kit bio rad according to manufacturer s instructions qpcr reactions were run in triplicate using a total reaction volume of 25 μl each reaction was comprised of 2x iq sybr green supermix bio rad 17 5 pmol of primer and 3 μl of template dna with diluted concentrations of approximately 10 ng μl 1 thermal cycling was conducted on an icycler iq bio rad following published protocols for the selected primers for mcra pmoa and 16s rrna genes si table s3 costello and lidstrom 1999 ferris et al 1996 luton et al 2002 steinberg and regan 2009 quantification analysis was done using ct values from the icycler iq software melt curve analyses were conducted on all products and a subset of samples was sent for sanger sequencing to confirm amplification of target genes data not shown 2 6 illumina sequencing of 16s rrna mcra and pmoa libraries duplicate dna samples from each column at the 7 6 cm depth from two sampling dates were selected for high throughput sequencing community analysis gene amplicon libraries for mcra and pmoa were created using the qpcr primers with added adapters for illumina sequencing compatibility 16s rrna amplicon libraries were created by amplifying the hypervariable v3 v4 region using the universal primers s d bact 0341 b s 17 s d bact 0785 a a 21 klindworth et al 2013 dna samples from the original leach field and control soils at the same depth were also sequenced for comparison to the soil column communities additionally duplicate cdna samples from each column at the 7 6 cm depth were sequenced to examine the active microbial populations in the soil columns the qubit dsdna high sensitivity assay life technologies carlsbad ca usa was used to measure amplicon concentrations for a randomly sampled subset of reactions samples were submitted to cornell university biotechnology resource center for barcoding pooling and paired end 2 250 bp sequencing on the miseq platform illumina san diego ca usa 2 7 analyses of 16s rrna mcra and pmoa amplicon libraries resulting 16s rrna mcra and pmoa sequencing data was processed as described in fernández baca et al 2018 16s rrna sequencing data was analyzed using qiime v 1 9 1 and the greengenes reference database v 13 8 august 2013 functional gene sequence analyses were done with bwa mem and a curated reference database from fungene caporaso et al 2010 fernández baca et al 2018 fish et al 2013 li 2013 mcdonald et al 2012 alpha diversity was measured using both chao1 and shannon diversity indices shannon 1948 wilkins et al 2015 principal coordinate analysis pcoa and constrained distance based redundancy analysis dbrda plots were created with r version 3 3 3 using the phyloseq version 1 19 1 and vegan version 2 4 4 packages and the weighted unifrac distance matrix variance inflation factors were checked for dbrda constraining parameters vif 5 and for significance p 0 01 based on anova 3 results 3 1 soil volumetric water content soil vwc was monitored throughout the sampling period above and below the inlet fig 2 from august 2015 to february 2016 the start up phase vwc was monitored until measurements stabilized and during this time no other samples were taken phase i began after measurements stabilized during this phase column a was flooded and vwc was maintained at or above 0 26 m3 m 3 mean of 0 326 and 0 294 m3 m 3 at 15 cm and 64 cm below the surface respectively column a remained flooded for the duration of the experiment through all phases of operation in contrast column b shallow 15 cm depth soils were dry mean of 0 114 m3 m 3 during phase i and deep soils 64 cm depth were saturated mean of 0 316 m3 m 3 in phase ii column b mean vwc increased to 0 30 m3 m 3 in both shallow and deep soils confirming flooded conditions column b was drained over several months in phase iii after march 2017 there were occasional spikes in the shallow sensor for column b indicating intermittent flooding however after mid june the vwc sensors showed column b had consistently drier soils means of 0 169 and 0 146 m3 m 3 for shallow and deep soil respectively 3 2 atmospheric ch4 emissions ch4 emissions varied over the two year operation period fig 3 during phases i and iii column a had higher ch4 emissions than b fig 3a and c while in phase ii they had comparable ch4 emissions fig 3b ch4 emissions ranged in column a from a mean of 0 11 g ch4 m 2 d 1 in phase i to a mean of 0 20 g ch4 m 2 d 1 in phase ii finally dropping to 0 047 g ch4 m 2 d 1 in phase iii however none of these differences were significant p 0 1 between all phases in column b phase i and iii had average ch4 emissions close to zero means fluxes of 0 004 and 0 0025 g ch4 m 2 d 1 but in phase ii emissions were significantly higher mean 0 33 g ch4 m 2 d 1 as compared to phase i and iii p 0 046 and 0 044 respectively 3 3 subsurface ch4 concentration profiles ch4 depth profiles of the two soil columns evolved over the course of the experiment fig 4 during phase i subsurface ch4 concentrations ranged from atmospheric to a peak of 15 8 mg l 1 in column a and 0 637 mg l 1 in column b fig 4a during phase ii in column b average monthly methane concentrations 46 cm below the surface increased steadily from 1 87 to 9 28 mg l 1 while in column a peak subsurface ch4 concentrations ranged from 5 18 to 17 5 mg l 1 in the same time period fig 4b in phase iii column b was drained and methane concentrations above the inlet dropped over time to atmospheric while below the inlet peak methane concentrations remained high with observed concentrations between 1 3 and 12 3 mg l 1 from march to august 2017 fig 4c 3 4 mcra pmoa and 16s rrna gene and transcript abundances gene abundances of 16s rrna mcra and pmoa varied across sampling dates and with depth fig 5 mcra gene copies were highest near the wastewater inlet in both columns with abundances up to 7 11 107 and 2 07 107 mcra copies g 1 dry weight soil soildw for column a and b respectively the lowest mcra gene abundances were observed in surface soil samples 0 and 8 cm in contrast the highest observed pmoa gene abundances occurred in surface samples up to 1 99 108 and 5 80 107 copies g 1 soildw for column a and b respectively and decreased with depth 16s rrna gene copies followed a similar pattern with greater abundances near the surface and decreasing with depth transcript abundances of mcra and pmoa were used to estimate the activity of ch4 cycling microorganisms while 16s rrna transcript quantification was used to estimate baseline microbial activity fig 6 both 16s rrna and pmoa transcript abundances showed similar trends to gene abundances where the highest observed transcript levels were found in near surface soils and decreased with depth results for mcra showed methanogen activity was not necessarily restricted to soils surrounding the inlet but occurred throughout the soil column depth ratios of mcra to pmoa gene abundances were compared to mean monthly subsurface concentrations of ch4 for each of the three sampling dates si fig s1 a significant positive relationship between log10 mcra pmoa gene abundances and log10 mean monthly ch4 concentrations mg l 1 was found for one sampling date in column b r2 0 829 p 0 0318 weak positive correlations were observed for all other sampling dates r2 ranging from 0 23 to 0 65 and p values between 0 110 and 0 414 additionally weak positive relationships were observed between ch4 concentrations and ratios of mcra pmoa transcript abundances however again these correlations were not significant at a 95 confidence interval si fig s2 3 5 16s rrna mcra and pmoa amplicon library sequencing 16s rrna sequencing data was quality filtered and low quality sequences were removed resulting in a total of 105 113 reads mean assigned reads per sample for dna was 12 502 ranging from 6706 to 17 672 and for cdna was 6838 ranging from 21 to 14 422 with a median read length of 444 bp singleton otus were removed resulting in 17 492 unique otus pcoa and constrained dbrda plots were created to visualize variations in microbial community structure at the dna level fig 7 pcoa revealed samples clustered together based on treatment i e column a b and original soil the dbrda constraining parameters surface ch4 flux and soil vwc explained approximately 79 of the variation observed in the unconstrained plot pc1 22 7 and pc2 11 2 an additional pcoa plot was used to examine differences in community diversity between gene and transcript libraries si fig s3 which revealed the microbial communities in the columns diverged even more at the transcript level functional gene sequencing of mcra and pmoa amplicon libraries was further used to study ch4 cycling populations sequencing results for mcra and pmoa amplicon libraries were varied with more total reads assigned for mcra 87 979 than for pmoa 853 mean mapped reads per sample was 12 242 for mcra and 420 for pmoa samples methanogen diversity in the experimental columns and original soils was studied using the mcra amplicon libraries at the family and genus level fig 8 a and si fig s4a relative abundance of methanosaetaceae increased in column a 39 of reads as compared to column b 14 of reads and the original soils 12 1 and 17 4 for leach and control soils respectively methanotroph populations were examined using the functional gene pmoa at both the family and genus level fig 8b and si fig s4b methylococcaceae and methylocystaceae type i and type ii methanotroph families respectively dominated both soil columns and original soils with column a having a relatively greater number of reads associated with methylocystaceae 54 of reads mapped to this family as compared to column b and original soils less than 15 of mapped reads per sample a large fraction of reads from column b 30 and the original leach field soils 16 were assigned to candidate division nc10 phylum organisms which are thought to couple methane oxidation to nitrite reduction luesken et al 2011 in the 16s rrna sequencing data loss of methanotroph diversity in column a is evident at the genus level where type ii methylocystis and methylobacter make up more than 80 of the assigned reads and the type i methanotroph methylomicrobium has disappeared si fig s5 chao1 and the shannon diversity values calculated from the 16s rrna sequencing data indicate that the original soils had the greatest observed diversity with chao1 values of 8787 and 9559 and shannon values of 7 55 and 7 59 for original control and leach field soils respectively column b had a chao1 value of 8239 and shannon index of 7 37 while column a had the lowest calculated diversity 5371 and 6 74 for chao1 and shannon respectively 3 6 nutrient and cod removal influent and effluent concentrations of nh4 po4 3 and cod were compared for flooded and well maintained soil columns fig 9 removal for both nh4 and po4 3 appears to be unaffected by flooding however nh4 removal did decline during column b s transition period from flooded to well maintained conditions nitrate and nitrite were produced at low levels in both columns and ranged from 0 to 15 mg l 1 as n cod removal was variable but higher in column b 75 removal prior to flooding as compared to column a 25 removal and declined after flooding nutrient concentrations were also measured with depth data not shown and peak concentrations for nh4 po4 3 and nitrate and nitrite were observed near the inlet decreasing with depth 4 discussion 4 1 ch4 cycling in leach field soil columns ch4 emissions from column b during well maintained operation phases i and iii were comparable to well maintained leach field systems measured in central new york which range from low rate net ch4 consuming 0 004 g ch4 m 2 d 1 to net emitting sites 0 005 g ch4 m 2 d 1 truhlar et al 2016 under flooded conditions the soil columns exhibited increased ch4 emissions compared to non flooded conditions and had emissions similar to those observed in flooded leach field soils measured in summer of 2014 mean 0 26 g ch4 m 2 d 1 fernández baca et al 2018 ebullition events observed during the flooded phases of operation had peak rates of 1 45 and 1 71 g ch4 m 2 d 1 for column a and b respectively and were comparable to emissions from traditionally flooded soils such as rice paddies 0 24 1 44 g ch4 m 2 d 1 and peat bogs 0 21 0 4 g ch4 m 2 d 1 indicating ghg emissions from leach fields could be significantly higher than previously thought deppe et al 2010 freitag et al 2010 lee et al 2014 subsurface ch4 profiles evolved over time with changes in soil vwc in phase i column b accumulated low amounts of ch4 at depth in contrast column a had ch4 concentrations between 5 and 20 mg ch4 l 1 during phase ii the two columns exhibited similar ch4 depth profiles with peak concentrations occurring near the inlet and decreasing both above and below subsurface ch4 concentrations in rice paddy and pasture soils have previously been shown to peak below surface between 8 and 40 cm deep and decrease with depth this pattern may be attributed to a combination of upward diffusion and low or no production of ch4 in deeper mineral soils chamberlain et al 2016 lee et al 2015 vaksmaa et al 2017 similarly in the experimental columns a combination of diffusion and microbial ch4 oxidation likely explain the low ch4 concentration in shallow soils high soil vwc has been correlated to increased ch4 emissions in soil environments as varied as pastures roadside storm water ditches and bogs chamberlain et al 2016 deppe et al 2010 mcphillips et al 2016 truhlar et al 2016 estimated the leach field of well maintained systems in central new york had a mean ch4 flux of 0 0196 g m 2 d 1 this study suggests a flooded system could have peak emissions 100 times greater thus proper installation and continued maintenance of septic system leach fields is essential to reducing net ghg emissions from these systems 4 2 ch4 cycling community composition methanogens and methanotrophs were present throughout both soil columns but had distinct depth profiles methanogens were more abundant near the wastewater inlet as indicated by greater mcra gene copies and less abundant both above and below although angel et al 2012 showed that certain methanogen species are robust to oxygen exposure we found that our lowest mcra gene abundances were observed at the surface 0 2 5 cm depth however at the transcript level we found that methanogens were active in near surface soils as suggested by the 1 5 2 fold higher mcra transcript levels observed in surface soils as compared to deeper soils below 23 cm in contrast methanotroph populations were more abundant near surface and became less abundant with depth lee et al 2015 and reim et al 2012 observed similar profiles in flooded rice paddy soils where methanotroph abundances were highest in near surface soil at the interface of oxygen methane gradients as o2 availability decreases aerobic methanotroph populations also declined even as ch4 concentrations increased suggesting that soil methanotroph populations are driven largely by o2 availability oxygen concentrations were measured several times during phase ii in this study data not shown and were found to be below detection dissolved oxygen detection limit was 0 025 mg o2 l 1 below the 8 cm depth thus decreasing o2 concentrations between the 8 and 23 cm depths may be responsible for the decline in methanotroph populations with depth mcra and pmoa gene abundances have previously been correlated to ch4 production potential in rice paddies and peat bogs freitag et al 2010 ma et al 2013 2012 we explored similar biomarker abundance to ch4 emission relationships in the leach field soil columns using log 10 of mcra pmoa gene or transcript abundances and mean monthly ch4 concentrations at each sampling depth si figs s1 and s2 moderately strong correlations were found between r2 of 0 230 and 0 829 indicating a positive relationship between the biomarker gene ratio and ch4 concentrations however the observed relationship was only significant for samples from january 2017 in column b r2 0 829 p 0 0318 this relationship appears to be driven in large part by mcra gene abundances which alone was significantly correlated to ch4 concentrations for the january 2017 sampling date r2 0 810 p 0 0386 whereas pmoa gene abundances showed no significant correlations for any date the link between biomarker abundances and ch4 potential may be obscured by differences in pore water and soil sample volumes soil samples were taken over a relatively small volume approximately 0 23 cm2 while pore water samplers pulled from a larger volume of soil potentially integrating small volumes of high activity with larger volumes of low activity 4 3 microbial community composition in leach field soils 16s rrna mcra and pmoa libraries were analyzed to characterize the microbial community structure in leach field soils with an emphasis on examining populations controlling ch4 cycling the 16s rrna libraries revealed that communities from the experimental leach field soil columns had diverged from those of the original soils at the dna level this variation was explained in part by soil vwc and ch4 emissions of the soil columns fig 7 soil microbial communities from original control and leach field soils were more similar to each other than either column a or b at the gene level at the transcript level greater divergence in community structure was observed indicating that active microbial populations differ from those present at the gene level si fig s3 krause et al 2010 observed a similar disparity between total and active microbial populations when examining methanotroph populations via pmoa gene and transcript abundances in flooded rice paddy soils pmoa amplicon libraries revealed two aerobic methanotroph families were present across all samples methylocystaceae and methylococcaceae methylococcaceae represented the majority of reads in all soil samples with the exception of column a where it accounted for 45 9 of reads this was in contrast to results from 16s rrna libraries si fig s5 which suggested that methylocystaceae was dominant across all samples greater than 85 of reads in all samples loss of methanotroph diversity in column a observed in the pmoa amplicon libraries was supported by 16s rrna sequencing results however family and genus level assignments differed considerably between the two datasets a majority of the16s rrna reads aligned to type ii methanotrophs greater than 75 of reads while in the pmoa library the majority of reads were type i methanotrophs and had a low relative abundance of type ii methanotrophs less than 18 0 in all samples except column a which had 54 1 of reads assigned to type ii lee et al 2014 similarly found that taxonomic affiliations based on pmoa libraries differed from those based on the 16s rrna libraries that could be attributed to primer biases or incomplete gene sequence information in reference databases mcra amplicon libraries revealed methanosaetaceae methanosarcinaceae methanobacteriaceae and methanomassillicoccaceae families combined represented the majority of reads approximately 43 across all soil samples these families as well as methanoregulaceae methanocellaceae and methanospirillaceae have previously been found in soil environments such as rice paddies and wetlands suggesting leach field soils have similar methanogen profiles to other high vwc soils bridgham et al 2013 interestingly mcra libraries revealed the presence of the anaerobic methanotrophic archaea candidatus methanoperedenceae anme 2d clade thought to couple methane oxidation to nitrate reduction in low abundance across all samples haroon et al 2013 column a had the most distinct methanogen profile with a loss of many of the low abundance genera observed in column b and the original soils and an increase in the relative abundance of methanosaeta relative to other genera the decrease in methanogen diversity observed in column a parallels that found in the pmoa and 16s rrna libraries and is supported by statistical diversity indices chao1 and shannon due to primer biases against archaeal sequences reads were sparse for the euryachaeaota phylum 21 total mapped reads in the16s rrna amplicon library and precluded comparisons between mcra and 16s rrna sequencing datasets the use of synthetic wastewater in this study likely impacted the soil microbial community structure in addition to having readily available c sources such as acetate there were no large particles that would be more resistant to microbial attack and could reduce effluent infiltration into soil additionally authentic septic effluent could introduce high numbers of methanogens and to a lesser degree methanotrophs to leach field soils the probable presence of anaerobic methanotrophs in septic tank effluent should also not be disregarded thus in situ leach field systems would have a constant input of methane cycling populations not mimicked in the study system however in situ systems likely reach a steady state in terms of microbial populations that do not fluctuate substantially over time unless there is a significant disturbance such as a change in soil vwc the findings in this study reflect a system that has been substantially disturbed from steady state 4 4 nitrogen phosphorus and cod removal septic systems can impact ground and surface water by leaching high loads of nutrients n and p cod and pathogens richards et al 2016 usepa 2002 in this study the soil columns were able to remove n and p effectively despite flooding both nh4 and po4 3 were removed at greater than 75 efficiency during all operational phases high n and p removals have previously been reported in well maintained leach field systems but had not previously been measured in flooded system gill et al 2009 pell et al 1990 in this study p is likely retained by complexation with aluminum al or iron fe oxides sequences of acidovorax sp and thiobacillus sp which can both oxidize iron anaerobically coupled to nitrate reduction were found in the soil columns indicating potential for fe oxidation creating minerals available for p sorption carlson et al 2013 16s rrna amplicon sequencing also revealed the presence of nitrifier denitrifier and ammonia oxidizing microorganisms indicating full or partial denitrification may be responsible for the high nh4 removals observed reads assigned to nitrifier genera including nitrospira sp were found in both columns with relative abundances of 0 4 and 0 8 for column a and b respectively well known denitrifier genera including pseudomonas bradyrhizobium and rhodanobacter as well as atypical denitrifers including anaeromyxobacter sp sequences were also found albeit at a low relative abundances less than 0 1 in both experimental columns ma et al 2008 sanford et al 2012 assimilation in microbial biomass accounts for a portion of the total n removal from the system however the contradictory results of high n and p removal and apparent low o2 concentrations are surprising to completely oxidize the cod and nutrients in the influent to the levels observed in the effluent more than 30 mg d 1 of o2 would need to be supplied during phase ii some nutrient measurements were taken throughout the profile including no3 si fig s7 which showed production of no3 near the surface 7 6 cm depth and around the inlet 23 46 cm below surface this suggests o2 diffusion from the atmosphere allowing for nitrification near surface additionally the measurements point to the potential of o2 contamination in the wastewater resulting in no3 production near the inlet although the wastewater was purged with n2 and stored in a collapsible carboy some o2 diffusion through the plastic tubing or carboy may occur dissolved o2 measured in the soil column showed concentrations were below detection below the first pore water sampler at 7 6 cm thus any o2 introduced into the soil column via wastewater would have been consumed immediately and may have contributed to oxic cycling of nutrients near the inlet nevertheless it is unclear where and how o2 was introduced into the system in sufficient quantities to completely treat n p and cod to levels observed in this study flooding impacted cod removal suggesting flooded leach fields could introduce high cod loads to nearby ground water furthermore although both n and p had high removals in this study further work should be done to better understand the biogeochemical cycling occurring in these systems as previous studies suggested septic systems can contribute significantly to ground water contamination of n and p bunnell et al 1999 cooper et al 2015 withers et al 2014 thus proper installation of leach field systems with sufficient spacing between laterals and the local ground water table is critical to maintaining high removal efficiencies without impacting nearby ground and or surface water 5 conclusions two lab scale leach field soil columns were constructed to study how flooding impacts ch4 and nutrient cycling in these systems ch4 fluxes and subsurface concentrations increased under failing by flooding conditions indicating soil vwc is a major driver of ch4 production in leach field soils mcra gene copies were greatest near the wastewater inlet in contrast pmoa gene abundances were greatest in surface soils soil column microbial community structure shifted significantly from the original leach field soils at the dna level and was explained by ch4 emissions and soil vwc active microbial populations differed from populations at the gene level suggesting analysis of both gene and transcripts is important to understanding microbial community and ch4 cycling dynamics flooding did not appear to affect nutrient removals however did negatively impact cod removal based on these results we suggest proper maintenance of leach field systems to avoid flooding is essential to mitigating their methane emissions and reducing their

19086,the hydrated electron eaq based reduction processes are promising for removing organic pollutants in water engineering systems the reductive kinetics especially the second order rate constants k e aq of eaq with organic compounds is important for evaluating and modeling the advanced reduction processes in this study the k e aq values for aliphatic compounds and phenyl based compounds are for the first time modeled by the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar method the structural features governing the reactivity of two classes of organic compounds toward eaq were revealed and the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital e lumo one electron reduction potential e red and polarizability α were found to be the important molecular parameters in both two models the built qsar models provide robust predictive tools for estimating the removal of emerging pollutants using eaq during wastewater treatment processes additionally quantum chemical calculations were employed to probe into the mechanism and feasibility of the single electron transfer set pathway in the eaq based reduction process the thermodynamic investigation suggests that the compounds with electron withdrawing groups tend to possess higher k e aq and lower gibbs free energy δg set and gibbs free energies of activation g set than the ones with electron donating groups indicating the set process occurs more readily it is also found that the refractory halogenated compounds can achieve dehalogenation via the set pathway graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydrated electron eaq second order rate constants qsar models single electron transfer quantum chemical calculation 1 introduction advanced reduction processes arps have been considered as promising and viable approaches to eliminate a wide variety of trace organic contaminants in water the increasing studies have been observed on the hydrated electron eaq activated by pulse radiolysis photoredox catalysis photoexcitation of organic chromophores and uv photolysis of ki sulfite among the arps yu et al 2018 the eaq is an extremely strong reductive specie with the standard reduction potential of about 2 9 v which can be structurally simplified as an excess electron stabilized by a known number of oriented water molecules siefermann and abel 2011 li et al 2012 the eaq can react with many compounds including recalcitrant persistent and toxic contaminants through a single electron transfer set process yu et al 2018 merino et al 2016 song et al 2013 vellanki et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 for example the eaq based arps represent enhanced dehalogenation of halogenated organic compounds e g polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs monochloroacetic acid triclosan and perfluorooctane sulfonate via rapid breakage of the c x bond x f cl br or i and release of halide ions gu et al 2017 jones et al 2003 li et al 2012 yu et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 therefore the eaq based reduction process has drawn increasing attention and can be applied to the decontamination of water similar to the advanced oxidation processes aops one of the key researches in arps is degradation kinetics of organic pollutants the second order reaction rate constant k e aq can be employed to quantify the reactivity of eaq toward organic compounds with k e aq values the removal efficiency of contaminants in water by arps can be assessed therefore the kinetic data are required for prioritizing organic compounds that are persistent during the eaq based arps experimental investigations demonstrate that the k e aq values of organic compounds vary greatly with molecular structures ranging from about 106 to 1010 m 1 s 1 anbar and neta 1967 buxton et al 1988 for example the measured k e aq values of various aromatic compounds range from 4 106 m 1s 1 for phenol to 3 1010 m 1s 1 for nitrobenzene anbar and hart 1964 although there are some experimental k e aq values for organic compounds a large gap still exists for the increasing number of organic compounds entering into the aquatic environment additionally which class of organic compounds has high reactivity with eaq through the set pathway is not clear up to now in view of the time consumption huge expenditure equipment dependence and analytical challenge to capture and identify transient species by experimental methods it becomes necessary to develop highly efficient in silico methods to predict the k e aq values and investigate the feasibility of organic compounds through the set pathway by the computational simulation method quantitative structure activity relationship qsar is one of the important modeling approaches which correlates molecular structures of organic compounds with their reactivity gupta et al 2016 li et al 2014b luo et al 2017a sudhakaran and amy 2013 zhu et al 2015 once a qsar model is established it generates results with minimal computational cost and is applicable for regulatory purpose the qsar modeling has been successfully applied in the prediction of reaction rate constants of oh o3 so4 ferrate vi and no3 with organic compounds gupta et al 2016 jin et al 2015 lee and von gunte 2012 long and niu 2007 li et al 2013 luo et al 2017a sudhakaran and amy 2013 xiao et al 2015 ye et al 2017a 2017b zhu et al 2015 however all of these studies are confined to predicting the rate constants in oxidation processes to our knowledge there was no qsar modeling on the rate constants of organic compounds toward the strong reductant eaq previous study on the reactivity of organic compounds toward eaq shows that the constitutional properties of molecules are related to their reactivity anbar and hart 1964 indicating that there is an intrinsic correlation between the eaq reaction rate constants with chemical structures therefore one purpose of this study is to develop simple low cost qsar models to predict the k e aq values and elucidate the impact of molecular structural features on k e aq quantum chemical calculation is an important alternative way to provide mechanistic insights into various reactions especially for the radical involved reactions since the experimental identification is technically challenging thus another purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility of organic compounds through the set pathway by using quantum chemical calculation and reveal the inherent reactivity of organic compounds with eaq in this paper a large dataset of k e aq values were collected for aliphatic and phenyl based compounds e g benzene and its derivatives polybrominated diphenyl ethers pcbs fluorenone quinolone atropine and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons subsequently we developed qsar models for these compounds respectively with multiple linear regression mlr and support vector machine svm regression technique quantum chemical calculations were conducted to calculate the thermodynamics of the reactions gibbs free energies of activation g set free energy δg set and enthalpy change δh set to investigate the feasibility of these reduction reactions and the pathway of set the impacts of the functional groups on k e aq and the thermodynamic viability of the reactions were also investigated to better understand the reactivity of organic compounds with eaq 2 methods 2 1 experimental k e a q dataset the k e aq values m 1s 1 of 125 aliphatic compounds and 184 phenyl based compounds were obtained from the literature and the ndrl nist solution kinetics database http kinetics nist gov solution index jsp tables a1 and a2 if a compound has multiple k e aq values the average of k e aq value for one compound was adopted for the qsar modeling the data were randomly divided into training and validation sets with an approximately ratio of 4 1 the log k e aq values ranged from 5 95 to 10 70 for aliphatic compounds and 6 95 to 10 75 for phenyl based compounds figure a1 both two classes of compounds cover wide ranges of log k e aq indicating the wide structural diversities in the dataset 2 2 calculation of molecular descriptors molecular descriptors that have been reported to impact the chemical reaction of organic chemicals were considered including constitutional descriptors percentage of h atoms h percentage of c atoms c n oh n rcoor n cooh n cc n csp3 n csp2 n csp n nh2 n nh n x and quantum chemical descriptors various atomic charges q max c q min c q max h q min h q min cl and q min br bond order molar volume dipole moment μ polarizability α ionization potential ip electron affinity ea electrophilicity index ω electronegativity ξ the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital e homo the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital e lumo the energy gap between homo and lumo e homo e lumo hardness η softness s and fukui indices f min f min f max f max f min 0 f max 0 gupta et al 2016 li et al 2013 2014a 2018 wang et al 2009 enoch 2010 jin et al 2014 ye et al 2017 additionally it is worth noting that we consider one electron reduction potential e red that can quantitatively describe the redox ability of organic compounds in qsar modeling salter blanc et al 2015 wang et al 2019 and the calculation method was detailed in text 1 of the supplementary material the mmff94 stochastic conformation sampling was used for the initial global minimal search for each compound which was carried out on chembio3d ultra 12 0 the resulting global minimum of all compounds were subsequently optimized with gaussian 09 program suit frisch et al 2009 the fukui indices are calculated with the dmol3 module embedded in material studio 6 0 detailed in text 2 of the supplementary material while other descriptors were computed with the gaussian 09 program suit several methods for calculating quantum chemical descriptors were compared including the widely used b3lyp and m06 2x functional combined with different basis sets 6 31g 2df p and 6 311 g d p and solvation models iefpcm and smd which are detailed in the text 1 and text 3 of the supplementary material 2 3 development and evaluation of qsar models the mlr and svm regression technique were utilized to select optimal descriptors and construct qsar models mlr is one of the most widely used linear modeling methods which is simple transparent and in favor of mechanism interpretation while svm is an important non linear technique stepwise mlr was used to screen significant molecular descriptors with spss 19 0 software the optimum mlr model was obtained by following the principles a less number of predictor variables high determination coefficient r 2 and low root mean squared error rmse b the variable inflation factors vif for the predictor variables are 10 c the model complies with the quik rules i e k x intercorrelation of selected descriptors k xy the correlation of the x block with y where x is the selected molecular descriptor matrix and y is the response variable vector the selected descriptors are subsequently used for the svm model development which is conducted in matlab 2014 the number of population was set to 20 i e totally 20 models were generated in every optimization step and the terminated generation was set to 100 the model with minimum variance was selected each time the radial bias function was used as kernel function the performance of svm models depends on several parameters including penalty factor c ε of the ε insensitive loss function and the kernel parameter γ these 3 parameters c γ and ε should be properly tuned and optimized in the svm model development li et al 2015 luan et al 2005 according to the oecd guideline on the development and validation of qsar models the internal and external predictive performance of the built qsar models should be evaluated apart from the goodness of fit thus the statistical parameters i e q 2 loo leave one out cross validated coefficient r 2 ext q 2 ext and rmse ext were calculated the bootstrap was performed to avoid overestimation of the model and the corresponding q 2 boot was calculated with 20 of data left out from the training set at each step repeated 5000 times gupta et al 2016 the applicability domain of the qsar models was assessed by the leverage approach using the williams plot li et al 2013 the applicability domain was visualized by plotting the standized residuals δ versus the leverage h the δ and warning leverage h were calculated as follows 1 δ y i y ˆ i i 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 n p 1 2 h 3 p 1 n tr where y i and y ˆ i are the experimental and predicted values for the i th compound respectively n is the number of compounds n tr is the number of compounds in training sets and p is the number of descriptors li et al 2013 compounds with the absolute values of standardized residual 3 0 are identified as outliers 2 4 thermodynamic calculation of the set process all the electronic structure calculations were performed using the gaussian 09 program suit according to previous work the four water molecules cluster h2o 4 binding an excess electron in tetrahedral fashion suggested to well represent the structural motif of eaq was used in the set process the various intrinsic parameters of eaq can be reproduced well with the iefpcm b3lyp 6 31g 2df p method kumar et al 2015 thus this method was considered in calculating thermodynamic parameters g set gibbs free energy δg set and enthalpy change δh set of h2o 4 reaction with compounds for compounds consisting of c h o f cl br n and s atoms the 6 31g 2df p basis set was used while the lanl2dz basis set was employed for i and se atoms the structures of all the reactants products eaq and neutral h2o 4 were firstly optimized using the b3lyp method combined with the 6 31g 2df p or lanl2dz basis sets for i and se atoms vibrational frequencies were subsequently calculated to verify that the optimized geometries are their corresponding local minima the δg set values of the set pathways at t 298 k were calculated as follows luo et al 2018 3 δg set e 0 g corrected products e 0 g corrected reactants where e 0 is the total electronic energy at t 0 k g corrected is the thermal correction to gibbs free energy the δg set values were calculated for all the 125 aliphatic compounds for phenyl based compounds however only the δg set values of 103 compounds consisting of a single benzene ring with various substituents were calculated so as to investigate the effect of functional groups on the k e aq the calculation of g set is based on the marcus theory which has been used for investigating the kinetics for the set reaction pathway for biomolecular reactions the calculation details can be found in many published papers gao et al 2014 luo et al 2017b 3 results and discussion 3 1 qsar models for log k e aq with mlr and svm methods in the preliminary screening of descriptors it is found that e lumo is the most important descriptor affecting log k e aq based on the correlation coefficient thus different calculation methods for calculating e lumo were compared the calculation results show that the iefpcm b3lyp 6 31g 2df p method presents the best performance a higher correlation between log k e aq and e lumo fig 1 in addition a higher correlation between log k e aq and e red α calculated by this method can also be observed compared with other methods figures a2 and a3 therefore it was adopted in the qsar model development considering the great structural diversity between aliphatic and phenyl based compounds we developed qsar models for them independently in order to reveal the differences equations 4 and 5 are the optimum mlr based qsar models for aliphatic and phenyl based compounds respectively based on the qsar model screening strategy above aliphatic compounds 4 log k e aq 8 024 10 016 e l u m o 0

rmse ext 0 447 q 2 ext 0 704 the respective r 2 tr for aliphatic and phenyl based qsar models are 0 751 and 0 704 which suggests that the qsar models reasonably fitted well with the training set for internal validation both q 2 loo 0 722 and 0 690 and q 2 boot 0 775 and 0 790 are larger than 0 50 indicating that the models are statistically robust tropsha et al 2003 k x k xy and vif 3 for the selected descriptors suggest that both models are free of multi collinearities table 1 as shown in fig 2 a and c the predictive deviation of log k e aq for almost all the compounds except pyruvonitrile no 112 are within 1 5 indicating good predictive performances of the models the statistical parameters of the validation sets r 2 ext rmse ext and q 2 ext also confirm the good predictive performances of the two models tropsha et al 2003 based on the selected molecular descriptors with the mlr method the svm based qsar models were built for aliphatic and phenyl based compounds respectively for aliphatic compounds the optimal svm parameters are c 0 609 ε 0 100 and γ 0 737 the statistical parameters for training and validation sets are n tr 100 r 2 tr 0 815 rmse tr 0 526 n ext 25 r 2 ext 0 795 rmse ext 0 312 and q 2 ext 0 788 for phenyl based compounds the optimal svm parameters c ε and γ are 7 152 0 051 and 0 537 respectively and the statistical parameters are n tr 147 r 2 tr 0 855 rmse tr 0 302 n ext 36 r 2 ext 0 854 rmse ext 0 350 and q 2 ext 0 820 both two svm based models exhibit good prediction abilities which can be also observed from fig 2b and d the random distribution of the log k e aq values around the dividing line equation y x in fig 2b and d indicates that there is no systematic error for the two svm models the comparison of goodness of fit and predictive power indicates that the svm based qsar models are more superior to the mlr based qsar models suggesting the flexible nonlinear modeling method can better model and predict log k e aq values of compounds especially for phenyl based compounds than the simple mlr method however the mlr based qsar models are much more transparent than the svm based qsar models which is easy for application the applicability domains of the two mlr based and svm based qsar models exploited by the williams method are displayed in figure a4 as can be seen from figures a4a and a4c there are one data point pyruvonitrile no 112 in aliphatic qsar model and two data points benzene no 14 and toluene no 87 in phenyl based qsar model with δ 3 indicating they are outliers pyruvonitrile log k e aq 7 48 is the only compound with c o and cn group in the dataset as compared to other three compounds cyanamide trichloroacetonitrile and dicyandiamide with cn and either electron donating or electron withdrawing groups their log k e aq values are all 9 1 similarly it is found that for compounds containing c o and other electron withdrawing groups their log k e aq values are generally 9 0 thus new experimental measures are needed to confirm the value of pyruvonitrile for phenyl based mlr model fig 2c it can be found that the low reactivity compounds log k e aq 9 are generally overestimated by the mlr model especially for benzene no 14 and toluene no 87 with the lowest experimental log k e aq values of 6 95 and 7 04 thus it is expected that the model performance can be improved if classification models for high reactive and low reactive compounds are built respectively just as jin et al 2014 performed in k o3 modeling in addition it s worth pointing out that folate is excluded from the dataset since its molecular dipole moment 67 4 debye is far larger than all the other compounds 23 2 debye thereby causing significant influence on the model performance we also try our best to develop a comprehensive model to predict log k e aq of both aliphatic and phenyl based compounds which is shown in the text 4 of supplementary material figure a5 and table a3 however overall the performance of this model is poorer than the independent models eq 4 and 5 and 3 outliers are identified figure a5 3 2 mechanistic interpretation of the two mlr based qsar models by interpreting the descriptors involved in eqs 4 and 5 it is possible to gain some structural insights into the factors that may affect the eaq involved degradation reactions it is found that the descriptors e red e lumo and α are all included in two models and play an important role in reactivity toward eaq compared to e homo that is usually present in qsar models of predicting oxidation reaction rate constants such as oh reaction rate constant k oh e lumo is the important predictor variable that is usually included in the reduction reaction table 1 kušić et al 2009 gupta et al 2016 e lumo which measures the susceptibility of a molecule towards attack by nucleophiles such as the strong nucleophile eaq can explain 60 1 and 56 4 variance of log k e aq for aliphatic and phenyl based compounds respectively fig 1a and figure a6 a molecule with a low e lumo value is more inclined to gain electrons from other sources and be reduced tang and wang 2010 karelson et al 1996 this can explain the negative coefficients of e lumo in our models e red describing the reduction activity of compounds is also selected to be an important descriptor generally compounds with higher e red can be easily reduced salter blanc et al 2015 wang et al 2019 as far as we know this paper reveals for the first time that e lumo and e red are important parameters governing the reactivity of organic compounds toward eaq which enhances understanding of the relationship between structures and activities for organic compounds in the reduction reactions the polarizability α which is defined as the ratio of the induced dipole moment of a molecule to the electric field that produces this dipole moment miller 1990 yang et al 2016 is an important electronic descriptor and linked to the overall reactivity of a compound a molecule with higher polarizability will be more reactive to either nucleophiles or electrophiles because the electron distribution in the molecule is more flexible or easier to distort edwards and pearson 1962 previous studies on oh and o3 invovled degradation of organic compounds revealed that the polarizability plays an important role in reactivity kušić et al 2009 liu et al 2010 yang et al 2016 except e red e lumo and α the other molecular parameters governing the reactivity of aliphatic and phenyl based compounds toward eaq are different the fukui indice f is the measurement of the ability of electrophilic attack generally a molecule is susceptible to electrophilic attack at sites where the f values are large in contrast the site with mimimum value of f i e f min indicates lower electron density therefore it is more likely to be attacked by the nucleophile nrcoor that represents the number of esters aliphatic negatively correlates with log k e aq it can be attributed to the retarding effect of the or group in the carbonyl group c o or which is known as mesomeric effect of the substituents hart et al 1967 the mesomeric forms depress the double bond character of the co group make the carbonyl bond nonreactive toward eaq and create new electrophilic centers of lower reactivity q min br characterizing the most negative br atom charge in an organic molecule is negatively related with log k e aq with a more negative q br charge the c atom connected to the br atom tends to have more positive charge leading to high reactivity toward eaq μ denoting molecular dipole moment is closely related to molecular polarizability which has been explained in detail above h represents the percentage of h atoms in general a molecule with larger percentage of h atoms means that its unsaturation degree is lower i e the lower number of unsaturated bonds electron withdrawing groups such as cc cc etc previous studies concerning so4 oh involved aops revealed that compounds with electron donating groups typically exhibit enhanced reactivity toward the oxidant so4 luo et al 2017b ye et al 2017a winkler et al 2016 thus the result is expected to be reversed for the reductant eaq and can explain the negative coefficient of h 3 3 thermodynamics and reaction mechanisms for the set process the calculated g set δg set and δh set values for 125 aliphatic compounds and 103 substituted benzenes reaction with eaq via the set pathway are tabulated in tables a4 and a5 respectively to gain a more powerful insight into the relationship between the thermodynamic information and eaq reactivity we plotted log k e aq versus the calculated g set values in figures a7 a significantly negative correlation between log k e aq and g set is observed for both two kinds of compounds suggesting that an organic compound with higher log k e aq value tends to have lower g set value i e the set process in the reduction reaction occurs more readily additionally it is also found that compounds with higher log k e aq values generally tends to have lower δg set and δh set values indicating the reactions are more favorable thermodynamically it is thermodynamically feasible for the set pathway of 95 aliphatic compounds with δg set values ranging from 88 05 to 0 30 kcal mol 1 almost all the aliphatic compounds containing halogen atoms except 1 1 1 trifluoroacetone and methyl trifluoroacetate can spontaneously proceed via dehalogenation with x f cl br and i release after gaining electrons from eaq this further verifies that the eaq based reduction technology is a highly efficient method for removing refractory halogenated compounds additionally 2 mercaptoethylguanidine and 2 aminoethanethiol can spontaneously lose the hs group and hydroxyurea spontaneously loses the oh group after gaining electrons apart from releasing halogen atoms hs and oh groups seven compounds 1 1 dimethylhydrazine methylhydrazine methylamine ethylamine isobutylamine propylamine and ethanolamine can lose one h atom via the set process however this process is not thermodynamically favorable because of the high δg set values ranging from 6 18 to 30 46 kcal mol 1 for substituted benzenes the reactions of 81 compounds out of 103 compounds with eaq via the set process are thermodynamically feasible with the δg set ranging from 70 51 to 0 21 kcal mol 1 for halogenated benzenes the set processes cannot always lead to dehalogenation both for thermodynamically feasible pathways and infeasible pathways depending on the substituent groups of benzene rings and lumo distribution to some degree table 2 lists molecular orbital contours of the lumo for some aromatic contaminants the lumo distribution in one molecule represents the site which can accept electrons if there is too little lumo distribution in the halogen atoms it is infeasible for halogenated aromatic contaminants e g 1 chloro 2 methyl 3 nitrobenzene 4 chloro 1 methyl 2 nitrobenzene 1 chloro 3 nitro benzene 3 chloro benzaldehyde 1 2 3 4 5 6 pentafluoro phenyl ethanone 2 3 4 5 6 pentafluorostyrene 2 3 4 5 6 pentafluorobenzaldehyde 2 3 4 5 6 pentafluorobenzonitrile 2 chloro benzaldehyde and 1 2 3 4 5 pentafluoro 6 nitrobenzene with electron withdrawing groups such as no2 cho chch2 and c o ch3 to dehalogenate after gaining electrons from eaq the reason can be attributed to the competition between the electron withdrawing groups and halogen atoms for halogenated aromatic contaminants with electron donating groups two cases can occur for dehalogenation or not one case is that if the lumo distributions don t cover electron donating groups such as nh2 oh and och3 but cover halogen atoms the dehalogenation can occur easily which can be seen from 2 chloro aniline 3 chloro aniline 3 bromo phenol and 3 iodo benzoate the second case is that if the lumo distributions cover electron donating groups and meanwhile with less distribution of lumo on the halogen atoms the dehalogenation is hard to occur e g 2 fluoro benzoate 3 fluoro benzoate and 3 chloro benzoate however if more lumo distribution can be observed on the halogen atom the dehalogenation can also be achieved such as 4 bromo benzoate 3 iodo benzoate and pentafluorophenylhydrazine besides it is noted that benzyl formate and benzyl acetate can form hcoo c6h5ch2 and ch3coo c6h5ch2 via the set process with the δg set of 47 2 and 45 67 kcal mol 1 respectively take benzyl acetate for example we can see from table 2 that the lumo distribution includes ch2 c6h5 and c o o group the withdrawing group c o o group would compete for gaining electron from eaq with the c6h5ch2 group thus would lead to rapid lose ch3coo and to the generation of aromatic radical c6h5ch2 as far as we know this study is the first to systematically investigate the thermodynamic feasibility of eaq reactions by quantum chemical calculations which may provide some new insights into applications of arps in water treatment table a6 summaries the reaction mechanisms for several compounds with eaq via set route and the subsequent degradation pathways since their reaction intermediates have been identified by previous studies generally for halogenated organic compounds the electron attachment and halide ion formation may proceed via two mechanisms i direct dissociation to generate halide ion and organic radical for halogenated aliphatic compounds ii firstly forming a radical anion with subsequent activation and dissociation into halide ion and organic radical for halogenated aromatic derivatives li et al 2012 this can be confirmed by previous studies detailed in table a6 it s worth mentioning that for compounds with multiple halogen atoms gradual dehalogenation can occur yuan et al 2014 the formed radicals are unstable and then undergo several different reactions depending on their natures in general these radicals can subsequently react with other species or be quenched by other species in the reaction system finally forming stable species which can be found in the degradation reactions of 2 chlorobiphenyl and 4 bromophenol table a6 or these radicals can undergo polymerization or recombination between radicals czaplicka 2006 li et al 2012 yuan et al 2014 xie et al 2017 for example biphenyl and chlorobiphenyl can be identified in the reaction of bromobenzene and chlorinated benzenes with eaq 3 4 effects of functional groups on log k e a q previous studies show that the set routes for aromatic compounds with electron donating groups are more thermodynamically feasible for oxidation reactions involving so4 oh winkler et al 2016 luo et al 2018 therefore we hypothesize that organic compounds with electron withdrawing groups should exhibit higher reactivity toward the strong reductant eaq accordingly we carried out a systematical investigation on the role of electron donating withdrawing functional groups on the set reactions aliphatic compounds were generally grouped into 7 classes i e oh coo nh nh2 c o cooh coor cc and x table a7 as shown in fig 3 a the aliphatic compounds with different functional groups exhibit significantly different eaq reactivity the log k e aq values for aliphatic compounds with electron withdrawing groups x cc cooh coor and c o are higher than those with electron donating groups oh coo and nh nh2 allylamine with log k e aq 7 08 and ethanolamine with log k e aq 7 30 are classified into the nh nh2 and cc groups and nh nh2 and oh groups respectively due to their very low log k e aq values compared to other compounds with cc and oh group they can be recognized as outliers in addition we plotted the δg set and g set values of all the aliphatic compounds versus the functional groups in figures a9a and 3b it shows that δg set and g set exhibit significant variation with different functional groups generally it can be concluded that aliphatic compounds with electron withdrawing groups have lower δg set and g set values indicating they react more readily with eaq than those containing electron donating groups similarly sarcosine and allylamine are recognized as outliers it is worth mentioning that we compared several methods for calculating δg set figure a9 and they all followed the same trend i e it is more favorable thermodynamically for compounds containing electron withdrawing groups than those with electron donating groups the functional groups of 103 substituted benzenes can be grouped into strongly moderately and weakly electron donating withdrawing groups based on the previous study table a8 luo et al 2017b the log k e aq g set and δg set values for 6 classes of functional groups are plotted in fig 4 and figure a8b respectively overall compounds with electron withdrawing groups possess higher log k e aq lower δg set and g set than those with electron donating groups suggesting that the compounds with electron withdrawing groups are more likely to be reduced by eaq through the set pathway furthermore the log k e aq values of compounds increase with the increasing of electron withdrawing ability from weak to strong of functional groups fig 4a however it is not the case for the compounds with electron donating groups this result may be ascribed to two facts one is that compounds with strongly and weakly electron donating groups cover a larger range of log k e aq 7 48 10 53 and 7 00 10 61 as compared to other groups the other is that some compounds are complex molecules containing both electron withdrawing and electron donating groups moreover the former out competes the latter in the set reactions resulting in high reaction rate constants such as 2 nitrophenolate 3 nitrophenolate 4 nitro peroxybenzoic acid and caffeate thus linear correlations between log k e aq g set and functional groups were not observed in fig 4 4 conclusion in this study we have developed qsar models for predicting k e aq of aliphatic and phenyl based compounds investigated the structural parameters affecting reactivity and unveiled the reaction feasibility via the set pathways by quantum chemical calculations both qsar models exhibit satisfactory goodness of fit robustness and good predictability and can serve as prescreening tools with generalized removal prediction the e lumo e red and α are the most important molecular structural parameters governing the reactivity of organic compounds with eaq compounds with electron withdrawing groups tend to possess faster second order rate constants the thermodynamic investigation of the set pathways revealed that compounds with higher k e aq tend to possess lower g set δg set and δh set suggesting the set process occurs more readily the thermodynamic results also advance the mechanistic understanding of the set pathways in the eaq based reduction processes additionally dehalogenation occurs in the set pathway suggesting the eaq based reduction processes are promising technology for destroying refractory halogenated compounds in water declaration of

19086,the hydrated electron eaq based reduction processes are promising for removing organic pollutants in water engineering systems the reductive kinetics especially the second order rate constants k e aq of eaq with organic compounds is important for evaluating and modeling the advanced reduction processes in this study the k e aq values for aliphatic compounds and phenyl based compounds are for the first time modeled by the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar method the structural features governing the reactivity of two classes of organic compounds toward eaq were revealed and the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital e lumo one electron reduction potential e red and polarizability α were found to be the important molecular parameters in both two models the built qsar models provide robust predictive tools for estimating the removal of emerging pollutants using eaq during wastewater treatment processes additionally quantum chemical calculations were employed to probe into the mechanism and feasibility of the single electron transfer set pathway in the eaq based reduction process the thermodynamic investigation suggests that the compounds with electron withdrawing groups tend to possess higher k e aq and lower gibbs free energy δg set and gibbs free energies of activation g set than the ones with electron donating groups indicating the set process occurs more readily it is also found that the refractory halogenated compounds can achieve dehalogenation via the set pathway graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydrated electron eaq second order rate constants qsar models single electron transfer quantum chemical calculation 1 introduction advanced reduction processes arps have been considered as promising and viable approaches to eliminate a wide variety of trace organic contaminants in water the increasing studies have been observed on the hydrated electron eaq activated by pulse radiolysis photoredox catalysis photoexcitation of organic chromophores and uv photolysis of ki sulfite among the arps yu et al 2018 the eaq is an extremely strong reductive specie with the standard reduction potential of about 2 9 v which can be structurally simplified as an excess electron stabilized by a known number of oriented water molecules siefermann and abel 2011 li et al 2012 the eaq can react with many compounds including recalcitrant persistent and toxic contaminants through a single electron transfer set process yu et al 2018 merino et al 2016 song et al 2013 vellanki et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 for example the eaq based arps represent enhanced dehalogenation of halogenated organic compounds e g polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs monochloroacetic acid triclosan and perfluorooctane sulfonate via rapid breakage of the c x bond x f cl br or i and release of halide ions gu et al 2017 jones et al 2003 li et al 2012 yu et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 therefore the eaq based reduction process has drawn increasing attention and can be applied to the decontamination of water similar to the advanced oxidation processes aops one of the key researches in arps is degradation kinetics of organic pollutants the second order reaction rate constant k e aq can be employed to quantify the reactivity of eaq toward organic compounds with k e aq values the removal efficiency of contaminants in water by arps can be assessed therefore the kinetic data are required for prioritizing organic compounds that are persistent during the eaq based arps experimental investigations demonstrate that the k e aq values of organic compounds vary greatly with molecular structures ranging from about 106 to 1010 m 1 s 1 anbar and neta 1967 buxton et al 1988 for example the measured k e aq values of various aromatic compounds range from 4 106 m 1s 1 for phenol to 3 1010 m 1s 1 for nitrobenzene anbar and hart 1964 although there are some experimental k e aq values for organic compounds a large gap still exists for the increasing number of organic compounds entering into the aquatic environment additionally which class of organic compounds has high reactivity with eaq through the set pathway is not clear up to now in view of the time consumption huge expenditure equipment dependence and analytical challenge to capture and identify transient species by experimental methods it becomes necessary to develop highly efficient in silico methods to predict the k e aq values and investigate the feasibility of organic compounds through the set pathway by the computational simulation method quantitative structure activity relationship qsar is one of the important modeling approaches which correlates molecular structures of organic compounds with their reactivity gupta et al 2016 li et al 2014b luo et al 2017a sudhakaran and amy 2013 zhu et al 2015 once a qsar model is established it generates results with minimal computational cost and is applicable for regulatory purpose the qsar modeling has been successfully applied in the prediction of reaction rate constants of oh o3 so4 ferrate vi and no3 with organic compounds gupta et al 2016 jin et al 2015 lee and von gunte 2012 long and niu 2007 li et al 2013 luo et al 2017a sudhakaran and amy 2013 xiao et al 2015 ye et al 2017a 2017b zhu et al 2015 however all of these studies are confined to predicting the rate constants in oxidation processes to our knowledge there was no qsar modeling on the rate constants of organic compounds toward the strong reductant eaq previous study on the reactivity of organic compounds toward eaq shows that the constitutional properties of molecules are related to their reactivity anbar and hart 1964 indicating that there is an intrinsic correlation between the eaq reaction rate constants with chemical structures therefore one purpose of this study is to develop simple low cost qsar models to predict the k e aq values and elucidate the impact of molecular structural features on k e aq quantum chemical calculation is an important alternative way to provide mechanistic insights into various reactions especially for the radical involved reactions since the experimental identification is technically challenging thus another purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility of organic compounds through the set pathway by using quantum chemical calculation and reveal the inherent reactivity of organic compounds with eaq in this paper a large dataset of k e aq values were collected for aliphatic and phenyl based compounds e g benzene and its derivatives polybrominated diphenyl ethers pcbs fluorenone quinolone atropine and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons subsequently we developed qsar models for these compounds respectively with multiple linear regression mlr and support vector machine svm regression technique quantum chemical calculations were conducted to calculate the thermodynamics of the reactions gibbs free energies of activation g set free energy δg set and enthalpy change δh set to investigate the feasibility of these reduction reactions and the pathway of set the impacts of the functional groups on k e aq and the thermodynamic viability of the reactions were also investigated to better understand the reactivity of organic compounds with eaq 2 methods 2 1 experimental k e a q dataset the k e aq values m 1s 1 of 125 aliphatic compounds and 184 phenyl based compounds were obtained from the literature and the ndrl nist solution kinetics database http kinetics nist gov solution index jsp tables a1 and a2 if a compound has multiple k e aq values the average of k e aq value for one compound was adopted for the qsar modeling the data were randomly divided into training and validation sets with an approximately ratio of 4 1 the log k e aq values ranged from 5 95 to 10 70 for aliphatic compounds and 6 95 to 10 75 for phenyl based compounds figure a1 both two classes of compounds cover wide ranges of log k e aq indicating the wide structural diversities in the dataset 2 2 calculation of molecular descriptors molecular descriptors that have been reported to impact the chemical reaction of organic chemicals were considered including constitutional descriptors percentage of h atoms h percentage of c atoms c n oh n rcoor n cooh n cc n csp3 n csp2 n csp n nh2 n nh n x and quantum chemical descriptors various atomic charges

fukui indices f min f min f max f max f min 0 f max 0 gupta et al 2016 li et al 2013 2014a 2018 wang et al 2009 enoch 2010 jin et al 2014 ye et al 2017 additionally it is worth noting that we consider one electron reduction potential e red that can quantitatively describe the redox ability of organic compounds in qsar modeling salter blanc et al 2015 wang et al 2019 and the calculation method was detailed in text 1 of the supplementary material the mmff94 stochastic conformation sampling was used for the initial global minimal search for each compound which was carried out on chembio3d ultra 12 0 the resulting global minimum of all compounds were subsequently optimized with gaussian 09 program suit frisch et al 2009 the fukui indices are calculated with the dmol3 module embedded in material studio 6 0 detailed in text 2 of the supplementary material while other descriptors were computed with the gaussian 09 program suit several methods for calculating quantum chemical descriptors were compared including the widely used b3lyp and m06 2x functional combined with different basis sets 6 31g 2df p and 6 311 g d p and solvation models iefpcm and smd which are detailed in the text 1 and text 3 of the supplementary material 2 3 development and evaluation of qsar models the mlr and svm regression technique were utilized to select optimal descriptors and construct qsar models mlr is one of the most widely used linear modeling methods which is simple transparent and in favor of mechanism interpretation while svm is an important non linear technique stepwise mlr was used to screen significant molecular descriptors with spss 19 0 software the optimum mlr model was obtained by following the principles a less number of predictor variables high determination coefficient r 2 and low root mean squared error rmse b the variable inflation factors vif for the predictor variables are 10 c the model complies with the quik rules i e k x intercorrelation of selected descriptors k xy the correlation of the x block with y where x is the selected molecular descriptor matrix and y is the response variable vector the selected descriptors are subsequently used for the svm model development which is conducted in matlab 2014 the number of population was set to 20 i e totally 20 models were generated in every optimization step and the terminated generation was set to 100 the model with minimum variance was selected each time the radial bias function was used as kernel function the performance of svm models depends on several parameters including penalty factor c ε of the ε insensitive loss function and the kernel parameter γ these 3 parameters c γ and ε should be properly tuned and optimized in the svm model development li et al 2015 luan et al 2005 according to the oecd guideline on the development and validation of qsar models the internal and external predictive performance of the built qsar models should be evaluated apart from the goodness of fit thus the statistical parameters i e q 2 loo leave one out cross validated coefficient r 2 ext q 2 ext and rmse ext were calculated the bootstrap was performed to avoid overestimation of the model and the corresponding q 2 boot was calculated with 20 of data left out from the training set at each step repeated 5000 times gupta et al 2016 the applicability domain of the qsar models was assessed by the leverage approach using the williams plot li et al 2013 the applicability domain was visualized by plotting the standized residuals δ versus the leverage h the δ and warning leverage h were calculated as follows 1 δ y i y ˆ i i 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 n p 1 2 h 3 p 1 n tr where y i and y ˆ i are the experimental and predicted values for the i th compound respectively n is the number of compounds n tr is the number of compounds in training sets and p is the number of descriptors li et al 2013 compounds with the absolute values of standardized residual 3 0 are identified as outliers 2 4 thermodynamic calculation of the set process all the electronic structure calculations were performed using the gaussian 09 program suit according to previous work the four water molecules cluster h2o 4 binding an excess electron in tetrahedral fashion suggested to well represent the structural motif of eaq was used in the set process the various intrinsic parameters of eaq can be reproduced well with the iefpcm b3lyp 6 31g 2df p method kumar et al 2015 thus this method was considered in calculating thermodynamic parameters g set gibbs free energy δg set and enthalpy change δh set of h2o 4 reaction with compounds for compounds consisting of c h o f cl br n and s atoms the 6 31g 2df p basis set was used while the lanl2dz basis set was employed for i and se atoms the structures of all the reactants products eaq and neutral h2o 4 were firstly optimized using the b3lyp method combined with the 6 31g 2df p or lanl2dz basis sets for i and se atoms vibrational frequencies were subsequently calculated to verify that the optimized geometries are their corresponding local minima the δg set values of the set pathways at t 298 k were calculated as follows luo et al 2018 3 δg set e 0 g corrected products e 0 g corrected reactants where e 0 is the total electronic energy at t 0 k g corrected is the thermal correction to gibbs free energy the δg set values were calculated for all the 125 aliphatic compounds for phenyl based compounds however only the δg set values of 103 compounds consisting of a single benzene ring with various substituents were calculated so as to investigate the effect of functional groups on the k e aq the calculation of g set is based on the marcus theory which has been used for investigating the kinetics for the set reaction pathway for biomolecular reactions the calculation details can be found in many published papers gao et al 2014 luo et al 2017b 3 results and discussion 3 1 qsar models for log k e aq with mlr and svm methods in the preliminary screening of descriptors it is found that e lumo is the most important descriptor affecting log k e aq based on the correlation coefficient thus different calculation methods for calculating e lumo were compared the calculation results show that the iefpcm b3lyp 6 31g 2df p method presents the best performance a higher correlation between log k e aq and e lumo fig 1 in addition a higher correlation between log k e aq and e red α calculated by this method can also be observed compared with other methods figures a2 and a3 therefore it was adopted in the qsar model development considering the great structural diversity between aliphatic and phenyl based compounds we developed qsar models for them independently in order to reveal the differences equations 4 and 5 are the optimum mlr based qsar models for aliphatic and phenyl based compounds respectively based on the qsar model screening strategy above aliphatic compounds 4 log k e aq 8 024 10 016 e l u m o 0

rmse ext 0 447 q 2 ext 0 704 the respective r 2 tr for aliphatic and phenyl based qsar models are 0 751 and 0 704 which suggests that the qsar models reasonably fitted well with the training set for internal validation both q 2 loo 0 722 and 0 690 and q 2 boot 0 775 and 0 790 are larger than 0 50 indicating that the models are statistically robust tropsha et al 2003 k x k xy and vif 3 for the selected descriptors suggest that both models are free of multi collinearities table 1 as shown in fig 2 a and c the predictive deviation of log k e aq for almost all the compounds except pyruvonitrile no 112 are within 1 5 indicating good predictive performances of the models the statistical parameters of the validation sets r 2 ext rmse ext and q 2 ext also confirm the good predictive performances of the two models tropsha et al 2003 based on the selected molecular descriptors with the mlr method the svm based qsar models were built for aliphatic and phenyl based compounds respectively for aliphatic compounds the optimal svm parameters are c 0 609 ε 0 100 and γ 0 737 the statistical parameters for training and validation sets are n tr 100 r 2 tr 0 815 rmse tr 0 526 n ext 25 r 2 ext 0 795 rmse ext 0 312 and q 2 ext 0 788 for phenyl based compounds the optimal svm parameters c ε and γ are 7 152 0 051 and 0 537 respectively and the statistical parameters are n tr 147 r 2 tr 0 855 rmse tr 0 302 n ext 36 r 2 ext 0 854 rmse ext 0 350 and q 2 ext 0 820 both two svm based models exhibit good prediction abilities which can be also observed from fig 2b and d the random distribution of the log k e aq values around the dividing line equation y x in fig 2b and d indicates that there is no systematic error for the two svm models the comparison of goodness of fit and predictive power indicates that the svm based qsar models are more superior to the mlr based qsar models suggesting the flexible nonlinear modeling method can better model and predict log k e aq values of compounds especially for phenyl based compounds than the simple mlr method however the mlr based qsar models are much more transparent than the svm based qsar models which is easy for application the applicability domains of the two mlr based and svm based qsar models exploited by the williams method are displayed in figure a4 as can be seen from figures a4a and a4c there are one data point pyruvonitrile no 112 in aliphatic qsar model and two data points benzene no 14 and toluene no 87 in phenyl based qsar model with δ 3 indicating they are outliers pyruvonitrile log k e aq 7 48 is the only compound with c o and cn group in the dataset as compared to other three compounds cyanamide trichloroacetonitrile and dicyandiamide with cn and either electron donating or electron withdrawing groups their log k e aq values are all 9 1 similarly it is found that for compounds containing c o and other electron withdrawing groups their log k e aq values are generally 9 0 thus new experimental measures are needed to confirm the value of pyruvonitrile for phenyl based mlr model fig 2c it can be found that the low reactivity compounds log k e aq 9 are generally overestimated by the mlr model especially for benzene no 14 and toluene no 87 with the lowest experimental log k e aq values of 6 95 and 7 04 thus it is expected that the model performance can be improved if classification models for high reactive and low reactive compounds are built respectively just as jin et al 2014 performed in k o3 modeling in addition it s worth pointing out that folate is excluded from the dataset since its molecular dipole moment 67 4 debye is far larger than all the other compounds 23 2 debye thereby causing significant influence on the model performance we also try our best to develop a comprehensive model to predict log k e aq of both aliphatic and phenyl based compounds which is shown in the text 4 of supplementary material figure a5 and table a3 however overall the performance of this model is poorer than the independent models eq 4 and 5 and 3 outliers are identified figure a5 3 2 mechanistic interpretation of the two mlr based qsar models by interpreting the descriptors involved in eqs 4 and 5 it is possible to gain some structural insights into the factors that may affect the eaq involved degradation reactions it is found that the descriptors e red e lumo and α are all included in two models and play an important role in reactivity toward eaq compared to e homo that is usually present in qsar models of predicting oxidation reaction rate constants such as oh reaction rate constant k oh e lumo is the important predictor variable that is usually included in the reduction reaction table 1 kušić et al 2009 gupta et al 2016 e lumo which measures the susceptibility of a molecule towards attack by nucleophiles such as the strong nucleophile eaq can explain 60 1 and 56 4 variance of log k e aq for aliphatic and phenyl based compounds respectively fig 1a and figure a6 a molecule with a low e lumo value is more inclined to gain electrons from other sources and be reduced tang and wang 2010 karelson et al 1996 this can explain the negative coefficients of e lumo in our models e red describing the reduction activity of compounds is also selected to be an important descriptor generally compounds with higher e red can be easily reduced salter blanc et al 2015 wang et al 2019 as far as we know this paper reveals for the first time that e lumo and e red are important parameters governing the reactivity of organic compounds toward eaq which enhances understanding of the relationship between structures and activities for organic compounds in the reduction reactions the polarizability α which is defined as the ratio of the induced dipole moment of a molecule to the electric field that produces this dipole moment miller 1990 yang et al 2016 is an important electronic descriptor and linked to the overall reactivity of a compound a molecule with higher polarizability will be more reactive to either nucleophiles or electrophiles because the electron distribution in the molecule is more flexible or easier to distort edwards and pearson 1962 previous studies on oh and o3 invovled degradation of organic compounds revealed that the polarizability plays an important role in reactivity kušić et al 2009 liu et al 2010 yang et al 2016 except e red e lumo and α the other molecular parameters governing the reactivity of aliphatic and phenyl based compounds toward eaq are different the fukui indice f is the measurement of the ability of electrophilic attack generally a molecule is susceptible to electrophilic attack at sites where the f values are large in contrast the site with mimimum value of f i e f min indicates lower electron density therefore it is more likely to be attacked by the nucleophile nrcoor that represents the number of esters aliphatic negatively correlates with log k e aq it can be attributed to the retarding effect of the or group in the carbonyl group c o or which is known as mesomeric effect of the substituents hart et al 1967 the mesomeric forms depress the double bond character of the co group make the carbonyl bond nonreactive toward eaq and create new electrophilic centers of lower reactivity q min br characterizing the most negative br atom charge in an organic molecule is negatively related with log k e aq with a more negative q br charge the c atom connected to the br atom tends to have more positive charge leading to high reactivity toward eaq μ denoting molecular dipole moment is closely related to molecular polarizability which has been explained in detail above h represents the percentage of h atoms in general a molecule with larger percentage of h atoms means that its unsaturation degree is lower i e the lower number of unsaturated bonds electron withdrawing groups such as cc cc etc previous studies concerning so4 oh involved aops revealed that compounds with electron donating groups typically exhibit enhanced reactivity toward the oxidant so4 luo et al 2017b ye et al 2017a winkler et al 2016 thus the result is expected to be reversed for the reductant eaq and can explain the negative coefficient of h 3 3 thermodynamics and reaction mechanisms for the set process the calculated g set δg set and δh set values for 125 aliphatic compounds and 103 substituted benzenes reaction with eaq via the set pathway are tabulated in tables a4 and a5 respectively to gain a more powerful insight into the relationship between the thermodynamic information and eaq reactivity we plotted log k e aq versus the calculated g set values in figures a7 a significantly negative correlation between log k e aq and g set is observed for both two kinds of compounds suggesting that an organic compound with higher log k e aq value tends to have lower g set value i e the set process in the reduction reaction occurs more readily additionally it is also found that compounds with higher log k e aq values generally tends to have lower δg set and δh set values indicating the reactions are more favorable thermodynamically it is thermodynamically feasible for the set pathway of 95 aliphatic compounds with δg set values ranging from 88 05 to 0 30 kcal mol 1 almost all the aliphatic compounds containing halogen atoms except 1 1 1 trifluoroacetone and methyl trifluoroacetate can spontaneously proceed via dehalogenation with x f cl br and i release after gaining electrons from eaq this further verifies that the eaq based reduction technology is a highly efficient method for removing refractory halogenated compounds additionally 2 mercaptoethylguanidine and 2 aminoethanethiol can spontaneously lose the hs group and hydroxyurea spontaneously loses the oh group after gaining electrons apart from releasing halogen atoms hs and oh groups seven compounds 1 1 dimethylhydrazine methylhydrazine methylamine ethylamine isobutylamine propylamine and ethanolamine can lose one h atom via the set process however this process is not thermodynamically favorable because of the high δg set values ranging from 6 18 to 30 46 kcal mol 1 for substituted benzenes the reactions of 81 compounds out of 103 compounds with eaq via the set process are thermodynamically feasible with the δg set ranging from 70 51 to 0 21 kcal mol 1 for halogenated benzenes the set processes cannot always lead to dehalogenation both for thermodynamically feasible pathways and infeasible pathways depending on the substituent groups of benzene rings and lumo distribution to some degree table 2 lists molecular orbital contours of the lumo for some aromatic contaminants the lumo distribution in one molecule represents the site which can accept electrons if there is too little lumo distribution in the halogen atoms it is infeasible for halogenated aromatic contaminants e g 1 chloro 2 methyl 3 nitrobenzene 4 chloro 1 methyl 2 nitrobenzene 1 chloro 3 nitro benzene 3 chloro benzaldehyde 1 2 3 4 5 6 pentafluoro phenyl ethanone 2 3 4 5 6 pentafluorostyrene 2 3 4 5 6 pentafluorobenzaldehyde 2 3 4 5 6 pentafluorobenzonitrile 2 chloro benzaldehyde and 1 2 3 4 5 pentafluoro 6 nitrobenzene with electron withdrawing groups such as no2 cho chch2 and c o ch3 to dehalogenate after gaining electrons from eaq the reason can be attributed to the competition between the electron withdrawing groups and halogen atoms for halogenated aromatic contaminants with electron donating groups two cases can occur for dehalogenation or not one case is that if the lumo distributions don t cover electron donating groups such as nh2 oh and och3 but cover halogen atoms the dehalogenation can occur easily which can be seen from 2 chloro aniline 3 chloro aniline 3 bromo phenol and 3 iodo benzoate the second case is that if the lumo distributions cover electron donating groups and meanwhile with less distribution of lumo on the halogen atoms the dehalogenation is hard to occur e g 2 fluoro benzoate 3 fluoro benzoate and 3 chloro benzoate however if more lumo distribution can be observed on the halogen atom the dehalogenation can also be achieved such as 4 bromo benzoate 3 iodo benzoate and pentafluorophenylhydrazine besides it is noted that benzyl formate and benzyl acetate can form hcoo c6h5ch2 and ch3coo c6h5ch2 via the set process with the δg set of 47 2 and 45 67 kcal mol 1 respectively take benzyl acetate for example we can see from table 2 that the lumo distribution includes ch2 c6h5 and c o o group the withdrawing group c o o group would compete for gaining electron from eaq with the c6h5ch2 group thus would lead to rapid lose ch3coo and to the generation of aromatic radical c6h5ch2 as far as we know this study is the first to systematically investigate the thermodynamic feasibility of eaq reactions by quantum chemical calculations which may provide some new insights into applications of arps in water treatment table a6 summaries the reaction mechanisms for several compounds with eaq via set route and the subsequent degradation pathways since their reaction intermediates have been identified by previous studies generally for halogenated organic compounds the electron attachment and halide ion formation may proceed via two mechanisms i direct dissociation to generate halide ion and organic radical for halogenated aliphatic compounds ii firstly forming a radical anion with subsequent activation and dissociation into halide ion and organic radical for halogenated aromatic derivatives li et al 2012 this can be confirmed by previous studies detailed in table a6 it s worth mentioning that for compounds with multiple halogen atoms gradual dehalogenation can occur yuan et al 2014 the formed radicals are unstable and then undergo several different reactions depending on their natures in general these radicals can subsequently react with other species or be quenched by other species in the reaction system finally forming stable species which can be found in the degradation reactions of 2 chlorobiphenyl and 4 bromophenol table a6 or these radicals can undergo polymerization or recombination between radicals czaplicka 2006 li et al 2012 yuan et al 2014 xie et al 2017 for example biphenyl and chlorobiphenyl can be identified in the reaction of bromobenzene and chlorinated benzenes with eaq 3 4 effects of functional groups on log k e a q previous studies show that the set routes for aromatic compounds with electron donating groups are more thermodynamically feasible for oxidation reactions involving so4 oh winkler et al 2016 luo et al 2018 therefore we hypothesize that organic compounds with electron withdrawing groups should exhibit higher reactivity toward the strong reductant eaq accordingly we carried out a systematical investigation on the role of electron donating withdrawing functional groups on the set reactions aliphatic compounds were generally grouped into 7 classes i e oh coo nh nh2 c o cooh coor cc and x table a7 as shown in fig 3 a the aliphatic compounds with different functional groups exhibit significantly different eaq reactivity the log k e aq values for aliphatic compounds with electron withdrawing groups x cc cooh coor and c o are higher than those with electron donating groups oh coo and nh nh2 allylamine with log k e aq 7 08 and ethanolamine with log k e aq 7 30 are classified into the nh nh2 and cc groups and nh nh2 and oh groups respectively due to their very low log k e aq values compared to other compounds with cc and oh group they can be recognized as outliers in addition we plotted the δg set and g set values of all the aliphatic compounds versus the functional groups in figures a9a and 3b it shows that δg set and g set exhibit significant variation with different functional groups generally it can be concluded that aliphatic compounds with electron withdrawing groups have lower δg set and g set values indicating they react more readily with eaq than those containing electron donating groups similarly sarcosine and allylamine are recognized as outliers it is worth mentioning that we compared several methods for calculating δg set figure a9 and they all followed the same trend i e it is more favorable thermodynamically for compounds containing electron withdrawing groups than those with electron donating groups the functional groups of 103 substituted benzenes can be grouped into strongly moderately and weakly electron donating withdrawing groups based on the previous study table a8 luo et al 2017b the log k e aq g set and δg set values for 6 classes of functional groups are plotted in fig 4 and figure a8b respectively overall compounds with electron withdrawing groups possess higher log k e aq lower δg set and g set than those with electron donating groups suggesting that the compounds with electron withdrawing groups are more likely to be reduced by eaq through the set pathway furthermore the log k e aq values of compounds increase with the increasing of electron withdrawing ability from weak to strong of functional groups fig 4a however it is not the case for the compounds with electron donating groups this result may be ascribed to two facts one is that compounds with strongly and weakly electron donating groups cover a larger range of log k e aq 7 48 10 53 and 7 00 10 61 as compared to other groups the other is that some compounds are complex molecules containing both electron withdrawing and electron donating groups moreover the former out competes the latter in the set reactions resulting in high reaction rate constants such as 2 nitrophenolate 3 nitrophenolate 4 nitro peroxybenzoic acid and caffeate thus linear correlations between log k e aq g set and functional groups were not observed in fig 4 4 conclusion in this study we have developed qsar models for predicting k e aq of aliphatic and phenyl based compounds investigated the structural parameters affecting reactivity and unveiled the reaction feasibility via the set pathways by quantum chemical calculations both qsar models exhibit satisfactory goodness of fit robustness and good predictability and can serve as prescreening tools with generalized removal prediction the e lumo e red and α are the most important molecular structural parameters governing the reactivity of organic compounds with eaq compounds with electron withdrawing groups tend to possess faster second order rate constants the thermodynamic investigation of the set pathways revealed that compounds with higher k e aq tend to possess lower g set δg set and δh set suggesting the set process occurs more readily the thermodynamic results also advance the mechanistic understanding of the set pathways in the eaq based reduction processes additionally dehalogenation occurs in the set pathway suggesting the eaq based reduction processes are promising technology for destroying refractory halogenated compounds in water declaration of

19087,seawater desalination facilities continuously discharge hyper saline brine into the coastal environment which often flows as a concentrated plume over the seafloor hence possibly impacting benthic microorganisms yet the effects of brine discharge from desalination plants on benthic bacteria key players in biodegradation of organic material and nutrient recycling is unknown in this study we tested the chronic years effects of brine discharge from three large scale desalination facilities on the abundance metabolic activity and community composition of benthic bacteria to this end four sampling campaigns were carried at the outfall areas of the ashkelon sorek and hadera desalination facilities the effects of the brine were compared to corresponding reference stations which were not influenced by the brine i e water temperature and salinity our sampling data indicate that bacterial abundance and activity that includes bacterial growth efficiency were 1 3 2 6 fold higher at the outfall area than the reference station concomitant analysis pointed out that the bacterial community structure at the brine discharge area was also different than the reference station yet varied between each desalination facility our results demonstrate that the impact of brine effluent from desalination facilities on benthic bacteria are site specific and localized 1 4 km2 around the discharge point namely that the effects on benthic bacteria are prominent at the brine mixing zone and change according to the discharge method used to disperse the brine as well as local stressors e g eutrophication and elevated water temperature our results contribute new insights on the effects of desalination brine to benthic microbes while providing scientifically based aspects on the ecological impacts of brine dispersion for decision makers graphical abstract image 1 keywords swro desalination brine effluent environmental impact heterotrophic bacteria brine discharge method 1

this study we focused on the chronic effects 5 13 years of swro desalination brine on benthic heterotrophic bacteria to this end we sampled the sediments around the outfalls of three large scale swro desalination facilities along the israeli coast on a seasonal basis between 2016 and 2017 fig 1 sediment samples from each of these sites were tested for different physiochemical characteristics as well as bacterial abundance production i e carbon assimilation respiration and community composition on discrete event november 2016 meiofaunal abundance and community composition was also investigated to the best of our knowledge this study provides the first indication on the possible effects of operating swro desalination on benthic bacteria 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling strategy sediment samples were collected in situ aboard the r v mediterranean explorer in proximity to three swro desalination facilities that have been operating for 5 13 years and located along the eastern mediterranean coastline hadera sorek and ashkelon fig 1 sampling campaigns were carried during november 2016 autumn january 2017 winter april 2017 spring and september 2017 summer each sampling cruise included sediment collection in close proximity to the brine outfall 50 m and a reference station at respective depth located several kilometers away from the discharge point fig 1 table 1 the reference stations were not influenced by the physicochemical characteristics of the brine namely the water temperature and salinity were similar to the ambient values water temperature and salinity profile were measured in real time by an ms5 probe hydrolab ms5 water quality multiprobe usa focusing on the values below the surface and above the bottom at the outfall and reference stations additionally a survey of the spatial and vertical dispersion of the brine was conducted in several campaigns winter spring and summer sediments were collected from each site by a van veen

by the addition of 100 μl of 100 trichloroacetic acid tca cold solution the sediment samples were then sonicated symphony vwr for 10 min to remove all the bacterial biomass from the grain particles

zeev et al 2008 dna extracts were kept in 20 c for further analysis in rnaase dnaase free water dna samples were sequenced by the illumina miseq platform the primers 515f and 806r were used to amplify the v4 region of the rrna 16s gene sequences in 250 bp length were trimmed from adaptors and merged by the clc bio genomic workbench qiagen bioinformatics operational taxonomic units otus picking was done with qiime caporaso et al 2010 by an open reference otu picking method followed by a β diversity analysis with the default parameters of qiime the β diversity results are presented in a pcoa plot generated based on the weighted unifrac distance matrix a comparison was made among all samples from a certain desalination facility sampled along all seasons the results from each season for each desalination facility were collapsed to overcome the seasonal variation presented in fig 5 samples were collapsed by summing the number of reads of each phylum from each sample into the final representative combination merging was done by qiime in order to statistically compare the community structure composition among the different stations in each site outfall and reference combined from all seasons an analysis of similarity anosim was performed by the r vegan package oksanen et al 2017 with 1000 permutations only phyla that exceeded 5 are presented 2 2 5 meiofauna abundance sediment

schonfeld et al 2012 meiofaunal species abundance including nematodes rotifers gastrotrichs platyhelminthes annelids tardigrades arthropods and mollusca as well as their taxonomic discrimination

dry sand 2 2 6 statistical analyses data from each desalination facility was first merged between all seasons i e the 4 cruises for each parameter ba bp bcd bge this pre procedure was done since the similar differences trends were observed for ba bp or br in the reference vs outfall sites table s1 along all sampling times this allowed us to discuss the overall effects caused by the brine on the benthic microbial communities at each site without the seasonal variations the differences between the reference and outfall sites were then analyzed by a t test using the excel add in xlstat 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characteristics at the outfall discharge and reference sites the three swro desalination facilities tested in this study exhibited large physicochemical variability between the outfall and the reference sampling locations these differences were mainly triggered by the brine discharge method undertaken coastal discharge vs diffuser system as well as by local release of other anthropogenic stressors such as sewage and well amelioration brines i e concentrated aquifer water with high concentrations of nitrate at the outfall sites rahav et al 2018 3 1 1 ashkelon desalination facility the plant has been operating since 2005 with desalinated water coming online at a rate of 115 m m3 y 1 the desalination brine is discharged via an open coastal channel fig 1 the concentrated brine from the seawater desalination process is mixed with cooling water of the adjacent power plant to reduce the salinity level and increase the buoyancy of the brine before its discharge back into the coastal environment consequently in situ measurements of salinity and water temperature at the outfall location indicated that these values were higher than the receiving environment by 10 and 34 respectively table 2 figs 2 and s1 our results indicate that in two out of the four sampling campaigns undertaken a brine plume defined as 2 5 salinity over the ambient levels was observed near the seafloor table 2 fig 2 under these conditions the brine plume spread up to 1 4 km2 around the outfall site fig 2 elevated salinity levels of 2 were considered as the natural dial or seasonal variability of the eastern mediterranean sea coastal zone gefen glazer 2014a glazer 2015 abramson and shafir 2016a in addition to the swro brine effluents desalinated brine from brackish water well amelioration facilities was also mixed with the brine from the ashkelon desalination facility drami et al 2011 brine from these well amelioration facilities was enriched with nitrate and silicic acid 150 μm and 97 μm respectively hence discharging it with the ashkelon desalination brine often increases the concentrations of these nutrients at the discharge site shafir and ben yosef 2017a nutrient amendments in this area may lead to eutrophication and prompt phytoplankton growth as has been recently reported by rahav et al 2018 furthermore the brine from the ashkelon desalination facility is occasionally mixed with sewage carried with the northern current from the south elmanama et al 2005 herut et al 2007 a recent study from the eastern mediterranean coastal water indicated that this type of sewage discharge may lead to abrupt microbial blooms rahav and bar zeev 2017 hence we surmise that the outfall area of the ashkelon desalination facility was affected from multi stressors that could result in a synergistic effect on the benthic microbial community 3 1 2 sorek desalination facility the plant has been operating since 2013 and is located northward from the sorek stream fig 1 the sorek plant is currently the largest swro desalination facility in the world producing 150 m m3 of freshwater per year during our measurements the brine was discharged directly without any prior dilution via a diffuser system located 1 9 km away from the shore at 20 m depth the measured salinity near the discharge point reached up to 6 over the ambient values 41 42 while water temperature remained unchanged table 2 fig 2 the brine was consistently found over the seabed with an affected salinity of 2 5 above the ambient area of up to 0 9 km2 table 2 during our sampling campaigns the dispersion of the brine around the outfall site was efficient namely that the salinity signal rapidly decreased from 5 to around 2 above the ambient 3 1 3 hadera desalination facility the hadera desalination facility was constructed near the outflow of the hadera stream fig 1 the plant has been operating since 2009 producing 127 m m3 desalinated water per year fig 1 the brine is mixed with the power plant cooling water prior its discharge via an open trench fig 1 which resulted in an increased temperature of 10 26 above ambient levels table 2 fig s1 additional dilution of the brine is achieved by mixing the brine with the hadera stream that may contain additional nutrients up to 6 mg l 1 nh4 and 3 mg l 1 po4 barinova et al 2010 therefore salinity increase over the ambient values was overall low ranging from 1 to 7 table 2 fig 2 our measurements indicate that the brine signal 2 5 increase in salinity above ambient level was detected near the seabed at two out of the four sampling campaigns undertaken in this study and spread southward from the discharge site fig 2 3 2 the effects of swro brine on benthic bacteria abundance respiration and activity the overall responses i e bp br and ba of the benthic microbial community to brine outfall vs reference sites were similar between the 4 cruises undertaken at each desalination facility table s1 we therefore pooled together the data of all the sampling campaigns for each bacterial variable at each desalination facility resulting in the overall impact of the brine near a specific desalination plant fig 3 information of the entire data set from all cruises is available in table s1 3 2 1 ashkelon desalination facility bacterial abundance and production rates ba and bp respectively were 2 fold higher at the outfall area compared to the uninfluenced reference stations fig 3a and b bacterial carbon demand bcd bp br which sums the cellular anabolic bp and catabolic br requirements of bacteria remained overall unchanged whereas bacterial growth efficiency bge bp bcd 100 was higher by 2 fold at the outfall area than the reference fig 3c and d concurrently to bacteria the abundance of meiofaunal organisms during the fall sampling campaign i e nematodes rotifers gastrotrichs platyhelminthes annelids tardigrades arthropods and mollusca decreased by 92 at the outfall station compared to the reference station table s2 meiofauna diversity was lower by 67 at the outfall compared to the reference stations table s2 in agreement with our measurements a significant reduction in benthic meiofauna abundance was previously reported in similar sites at the israeli coast shafir and ben yosef 2017b benthic bacterivorous such as nematodes and foraminifera are often susceptible to environmental stressors such as osmotic stress and alterations in water temperature a recent study pointed that the abundance and richness of foraminifera were highly reduced near power plant cooling water and brine discharge outfall zones titelboim et al 2016 we suggest that the brine along with the other contaminants at the mixing zone shifted heterotrophic bacteria from being top down controlled i e govern by bacterivorous abundance such as foraminifera and nematodes to being dominated by bottom up interactions i e exposure to elevated salinity and temperature as well as the availability of nutrients such as n p and c under this scenario the significant reduction in bacterivorous at the outfall may result in lower predatory pressure on bacteria hence increase in ba abundance at the outfall site enhanced bacterial activity measured as bp at the outfall area could result from local eutrophication processes namely chemicals that were directly associated with the swro operation e g phosphonates based antiscalants and indirectly by mixing the desalination brine with nutrients from nearby well amelioration effluents abramson and shafir 2016 shafir and ben yosef 2017a and or by sewage discharge from nearby gaza powley et al 2016 it is also possible that the increase in water temperature compared to the reference station due to mixing the brine with power plant cooling water table 2 fig s1 may also spur bacterial production rates these increased bp rates resulted in high bge at the outfall site compared to the reference station fig 3d we suggest that enhanced bge may be explained by the increased synthesis of various high molecular weight osmo protective molecules such as glycine betaine ectoine and glycerol poli et al 2017 wilson et al 2009 these molecules provide electrolyte homeostasis and maintain the bacterial fluid balance under osmotic stresses frank et al 2017 this regulation mechanism can provide adaptive preference to benthic bacteria capable assimilating synthesizing such molecules thus thrive in elevated salinities that are often present near desalination outfall sites we stress that this subject should be reinforced in future dedicated studies such information will be highly important to the understanding of how benthic microbial communities cope with changing environmental conditions due to multi stressors from anthropogenic sources 3 2 2 sorek desalination facility ba in the sediment was 1 3 fold higher at the outfall area than the reference sites whereas bp remained unchanged fig 3a and b yet bcd was significantly different between the two sampling stations at the reference site bcd was higher by 1 8 fold compared to the outfall location fig 3c concurrently bge was higher by 2 fold at the outfall in respect to the reference site fig 3d these changes were mostly attributed to the higher respiration rates measured at the reference stations 2 85 0 73 μg c gr 1 d 1 compared with the outfall area 1 31 0 50 μg c gr 1 d 1 and to a lesser extent by the bp rates that remained overall similar fig 3b additionally phosphonates organic phosphate based molecules which are often used as antiscalants in the desalination process drami et al 2011 belkin et al 2017 petersen et al 2018 can be found at higher concentrations near the outfall area of sorek 0 4 0 7 μm compared to the typical background levels 0 1 μm kress et al 2016a b it is possible that br rates as well as concomitant bcd and bge can be affected due to higher phosphonate concentrations at the outfall site compared to the ambient environment we stress that biodegradation of phosphonates by benthic microbes should be studied in relation to the desalination process and especially in oligotrophic p limited systems such as the eastern mediterranean sea krom et al 2010 meiofauna abundance and community composition i e number of phyla were overall similar between the outfall and reference stations with 30 higher abundances at the outfall table s2 the moderate difference between the outfall and reference stations implies that the brine dispersion was more efficient than the coastal discharge at the ashkelon desalination facility 3 2 3 hadera desalination facility benthic ba was similar between the reference and outfall sites fig 3a however bp fig 3b and br table s1 were significantly higher by 1 6 fold and 1 7 fold respectively at the reference site relative to the outfall station hence bcd was up to 2 fold higher at the reference site than the discharge point fig 3c despite these changes in bcd no significant trends were found in bge fig 3d total meiofauna abundance and especially platyhelminthes flat worm counts were higher 2 and 6 fold respectively at the outfall area than the reference station table s2 overall our results suggest that the discharged brine near the hadera desalination plant had a local and moderate environmental effect on the benthic bacterial biomass and activity we suggest that these moderate effects resulted from efficient dilution of the brine with the cooling water of the adjacent power plant which occurs on land prior its discharge as well as additional mixing of the outlet with the hadera stream this is in contrary with the ashkelon desalination plant where the brine is discharged directly to the coastal environment and is being diluted in situ with cooling seawater of the nearby power plant we therefore find that the discharge method applied in hadera desalination facility inflicted less environmental impact on the benthic microbes i e on ba bp and community structure than the one used in ashkelon despite both being a coastal discharge 3 3 changes in bacterial community structure in respect to the outfall sites of large scale swro facilities 3 3 1 ashkelon desalination facility pcoa analyses indicated a significant change between the bacterial diversity at the outfall and the reference stations fig 4 a anosim p 0 049 these differences are in accordance with the changes found for the biomass and metabolic rate variables at this area fig 3 we suggest that bacterial succession occurred toward halophytic species in the outfall area compared to the native communities that inhabit the unaffected reference station indeed members of planctomycetes such as rhodopirellula baltica that increased in their relative otus abundance from the reference 1 to the outfall 12 areas fig 5 are known to be highly adaptive to high salinities of up to 60 wecker et al 2009 further proteobacterial phylotypes were higher in the outfall vs the reference stations 46 vs 29 fig 5 members of this phylum have the genetic capabilities to express osmoregulated periplasmic glucans and thus cope with hyper saline environments bontemps gallo et al 2013 moreover actinobacteria which are important nutrient recyclers in the benthos including of polyphosphates hupfer et al 2007 kong et al 2005 were higher in the outfall 9 than reference 2 stations fig 5 since polyphosphates are often used for the swro desalination process lattemann and höpner 2008 prihasto et al 2009 it is not surprising that this phylum exhibited high relative otu abundance near the outfall interestingly the ubiquitous archaea euryarchaeota were found in the reference stations 17 but were almost absent 0 4 from the outfall area fig 5 although it was reported that this phylum can survive at high salinities yakimov et al 2013 3 3 2 sorek desalination facility analysis of the bacterial relative otus indicated that the bacterial diversity was insignificantly different between the outfall and reference sites in the sorek desalination plant fig 4b anosim p 0 799 this was despite the significant differences in the metabolic rate measurements fig 3 as well as the evident differences in the relative otus abundance of most bacterial phylum fig 5 that exhibited some seasonal variations relative abundance of firmicutes was 9 fold higher in the outfall stations vs the reference stations this bacterial phylum is a known member in trace metals contaminated sediments dell anno et al 2012 it is possible that the use of fe based coagulants in the desalination process prihasto et al 2009 may favor the abundance of this bacterial phylotype actinobacteria and euryachaeota phyla also differed between sites where the relative abundance was 3 6 fold higher in the outfall area compared to the reference station differently planctomycetes which have a central role in benthic carbon cycling fuerst and sagulenko 2011 was abundant in the reference stations and nearly disappeared at the outfall sites fig 5 3 3 3 hadera desalination facility both the pcoa fig 4c anosim p 0 568 and the relative otus analyses fig 5c point that the benthic microbial communities in the reference and outfall sites of hadera were highly similar proteobacteria dominated the bacterial phylum 46 50 followed by acidobacteria 8 planctomycetes 7 9 and bacteroides 5 the only notable difference was for firmicutes where the relative abundance reduced from 9 at the reference stations to 3 at the outfall site the similar bacterial community structure suggests that the brine discharge method namely additional mixing of the brine with the hadera stream fig 1 reduced the environmental impact compared to the ashkelon desalination facility this was also in agreement with the moderate changes observed for ba bp and bge fig 3 4 conclusions extensive construction of large scale swro desalination facilities is highly common in many arid and coastal regions worldwide yet only limited environmental research was done to estimate the impact of desalination brine on adjacent coastal ecosystems and especially benthic bacteria that inhibit these areas our results indicate that benthic heterotrophic bacteria are affected by desalination brine these effects are often characterized by changes in bacterial abundance and bacterial activity resulting in altered bacterial carbon demand and growth efficiency in addition brine discharge may change the benthic bacterial community at the outfall area nevertheless we found that these impacts were site specific and highly local namely that the effects of swro brine on benthic bacteria were a combination of the discharge method used to disperse the brine at each site and the local stressors including i eutrophication from different anthropogenic sources i e amelioration wells and or sewage runoffs and ii possibly due elevated water temperatures after mixing with cooling water from power plants we also surmise that swro brine can indirectly affect the abundance of heterotrophic bacteria by reducing the number of higher trophic organisms such as bacteriovorus due to osmotic stress the reduction in bacterivorous abundance such as nematodes and foraminifers may lead to bacterial proliferation and changes in microbial food web structure we propose that long term effects of desalination brine on benthic bacteria could be minimized by discharging the concentrate via diffuser systems thus removing the dependency of brine dilution on power plant operation and cooling water capacity in addition reducing the use of power plants cooling water will decrease the differences between water temperature at the outfall area and the receiving environment additionally the impact of swro brine on benthic meiofauna as well as of eukaryotic algae should be studied in future research to better evaluate the ecological effects of the growing desalination industry on coastal ecosystems acknowledgments we would like to thank the

19087,seawater desalination facilities continuously discharge hyper saline brine into the coastal environment which often flows as a concentrated plume over the seafloor hence possibly impacting benthic microorganisms yet the effects of brine discharge from desalination plants on benthic bacteria key players in biodegradation of organic material and nutrient recycling is unknown in this study we tested the chronic years effects of brine discharge from three large scale desalination facilities on the abundance metabolic activity and community composition of benthic bacteria to this end four sampling campaigns were carried at the outfall areas of the ashkelon sorek and hadera desalination facilities the effects of the brine were compared to corresponding reference stations which were not influenced by the brine i e water temperature and salinity our sampling data indicate that bacterial abundance and activity that includes bacterial growth efficiency were 1 3 2 6 fold higher at the outfall area than the reference station concomitant analysis pointed out that the bacterial community structure at the brine discharge area was also different than the reference station yet varied between each desalination facility our results demonstrate that the impact of brine effluent from desalination facilities on benthic bacteria are site specific and localized 1 4 km2 around the discharge point namely that the effects on benthic bacteria are prominent at the brine mixing zone and change according to the discharge method used to disperse the brine as well as local stressors e g eutrophication and elevated water temperature our results contribute new insights on the effects of desalination brine to benthic microbes while providing scientifically based aspects on the

this study we focused on the chronic effects 5 13 years of swro desalination brine on benthic heterotrophic bacteria to this end we sampled the sediments around the outfalls of three large scale swro desalination facilities along the israeli coast on a seasonal basis between 2016 and 2017 fig 1 sediment samples from each of these sites were tested for different physiochemical characteristics as well as bacterial abundance production i e carbon assimilation respiration and community composition on discrete event november 2016 meiofaunal abundance and community composition was also

strategy sediment samples were collected in situ aboard the r v mediterranean explorer in proximity to three swro desalination facilities that have been operating for 5 13 years and located along the eastern mediterranean coastline hadera sorek and ashkelon fig 1 sampling campaigns were carried during november 2016 autumn january 2017 winter april 2017 spring and september 2017 summer each sampling cruise included sediment collection in close proximity to the brine outfall 50 m and a reference station at respective depth located several kilometers away from the discharge point fig 1 table 1 the reference stations were not influenced by the physicochemical characteristics of the brine namely the water temperature and salinity were similar to the ambient values water temperature and salinity profile were measured in real time by an ms5 probe hydrolab ms5 water quality multiprobe usa focusing on the values below the surface and above the bottom at the outfall and reference stations additionally a survey of the spatial and vertical dispersion of the brine was conducted in several campaigns winter spring and summer sediments were collected from each site by a van veen

done with qiime caporaso et al 2010 by an open reference otu picking method followed by a β diversity analysis with the default parameters of qiime the β diversity results are presented in a pcoa plot generated based on the weighted unifrac distance matrix a comparison was made among all samples from a certain desalination facility sampled along all seasons the results from each season for each desalination facility were collapsed to overcome the seasonal variation presented in fig 5 samples were collapsed by summing the number of reads of each phylum from each sample into the final representative combination merging was done by qiime in order to statistically compare the community structure composition among the different stations in each site outfall and reference combined from all seasons an analysis of similarity anosim was performed by the r vegan package oksanen et al 2017 with 1000 permutations only phyla that exceeded 5 are presented 2 2 5 meiofauna abundance sediment

schonfeld et al 2012 meiofaunal species abundance including nematodes rotifers gastrotrichs platyhelminthes annelids tardigrades arthropods and mollusca as well as their taxonomic discrimination phylum level were performed using an olympus epi fluorescent microscope bh2 rfca species abundance was counted into 1 ml of sample volume for each sediment sample converted to individuals per gram of dry sand 2 2 6 statistical analyses data from each desalination facility was first merged between all seasons i e the 4 cruises for each parameter ba bp bcd bge this pre procedure was done since the similar differences trends were observed for ba bp or br in the reference vs outfall sites table s1 along all sampling times this allowed us to discuss the overall effects caused by the brine on the benthic microbial communities at each site without the seasonal variations the differences between the reference and outfall sites were then analyzed by a t test using the excel add in xlstat 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characteristics at the outfall discharge and reference sites the three swro desalination facilities tested in this study exhibited large physicochemical variability between the outfall and the reference sampling locations these differences were mainly triggered by the brine discharge method undertaken coastal discharge vs diffuser system as well as by local release of other anthropogenic stressors such as sewage and well amelioration brines i e concentrated aquifer water with high concentrations of nitrate at the outfall sites rahav et al 2018 3 1 1 ashkelon desalination facility the plant has been operating since 2005 with desalinated water coming online at a rate of 115 m m3 y 1 the desalination brine is discharged via an open coastal channel fig 1 the concentrated brine from the seawater desalination process is mixed with cooling water of the adjacent power plant to reduce the salinity level and increase the buoyancy of the brine before its discharge back into the coastal environment consequently in situ measurements of salinity and water temperature at the outfall location indicated that these values were higher than the receiving environment by 10 and 34 respectively table 2 figs 2 and s1 our results indicate that in two out of the four sampling campaigns undertaken a brine plume defined as 2 5 salinity over the ambient levels was observed near the seafloor table 2 fig 2 under these conditions the brine plume spread up to 1 4 km2 around the outfall site fig 2 elevated salinity levels of 2 were considered as the natural dial or seasonal variability of the eastern mediterranean sea coastal zone gefen glazer 2014a glazer 2015 abramson and shafir 2016a in addition to the swro brine effluents desalinated brine from brackish water well amelioration facilities was also mixed with the brine from the ashkelon desalination facility drami et al 2011 brine from these well amelioration facilities was enriched with nitrate and silicic acid 150 μm and 97 μm respectively hence discharging it with the ashkelon desalination brine often increases the concentrations of these nutrients at the discharge site shafir and ben yosef 2017a nutrient amendments in this area may lead to eutrophication and prompt phytoplankton growth as has been recently reported by rahav et al 2018 furthermore the brine from the ashkelon desalination facility is occasionally mixed with sewage carried with the northern current from the south elmanama et al 2005 herut et al 2007 a recent study from the eastern mediterranean coastal water indicated that this type of sewage discharge may lead to abrupt microbial blooms rahav and bar zeev 2017 hence we surmise that the outfall area of the ashkelon desalination facility was affected from multi stressors that could result in a synergistic effect on the benthic microbial community 3 1 2 sorek desalination facility the plant has been operating since 2013 and is located northward from the sorek stream fig 1 the sorek plant is currently the largest swro desalination facility in the world producing 150 m m3 of freshwater per year during our measurements the brine was discharged directly without any prior dilution via a diffuser system located 1 9 km away from the shore at 20 m depth the measured salinity near the discharge point reached up to 6 over the ambient values 41 42 while water temperature remained unchanged table 2 fig 2 the brine was consistently found over the seabed with an affected salinity of 2 5 above the ambient area of up to 0 9 km2 table 2 during our sampling campaigns the dispersion of the brine around the outfall site was efficient namely that the salinity signal rapidly decreased from 5 to around 2 above the ambient 3 1 3 hadera desalination facility the hadera desalination facility was constructed near the outflow of the hadera stream fig 1 the plant has been operating since 2009 producing 127 m m3 desalinated water per year fig 1 the brine is mixed with the power plant cooling water prior its discharge via an open trench fig 1 which resulted in an increased temperature of 10 26 above ambient levels table 2 fig s1 additional dilution of the brine is achieved by mixing the brine with the hadera stream that may contain additional nutrients up to 6 mg l 1 nh4 and 3 mg l 1 po4 barinova et al 2010 therefore salinity increase over the ambient values was overall low ranging from 1 to 7 table 2 fig 2 our measurements indicate that the brine signal 2 5 increase in salinity above ambient level was detected near the seabed at two out of the four sampling campaigns undertaken in this study and spread southward from the discharge site fig 2 3 2 the effects of swro brine on benthic bacteria abundance respiration and activity the overall responses i e bp br and ba of the benthic microbial community to brine outfall vs reference sites were similar between the 4 cruises undertaken at each desalination facility table s1 we therefore pooled together the data of all the sampling campaigns for each bacterial variable at each desalination facility resulting in the overall impact of the brine near a specific desalination plant fig 3 information of the entire data set from all cruises is available in table s1 3 2 1 ashkelon desalination facility bacterial abundance and production rates ba and bp respectively were 2 fold higher at the outfall area compared to the uninfluenced reference stations fig 3a and b bacterial carbon demand bcd bp br which sums the cellular anabolic bp and catabolic br requirements of bacteria remained overall unchanged whereas bacterial growth efficiency bge bp bcd 100 was higher by 2 fold at the outfall area than the reference fig 3c and d concurrently to bacteria the abundance of meiofaunal organisms during the fall sampling campaign i e nematodes rotifers gastrotrichs platyhelminthes annelids tardigrades arthropods and mollusca decreased by 92 at the outfall station compared to the reference station table s2 meiofauna diversity was lower by 67 at the outfall compared to the reference stations table s2 in agreement with our measurements a significant reduction in benthic meiofauna abundance was previously reported in similar sites at the israeli coast shafir and ben yosef 2017b benthic bacterivorous such as nematodes and foraminifera are often susceptible to environmental stressors such as osmotic stress and alterations in water temperature a recent study pointed that the abundance and richness of foraminifera were highly reduced near power plant cooling water and brine discharge outfall zones titelboim et al 2016 we suggest that the brine along with the other contaminants at the mixing zone shifted heterotrophic bacteria from being top down controlled i e govern by bacterivorous abundance such as foraminifera and nematodes to being dominated by bottom up interactions i e exposure to elevated salinity and temperature as well as the availability of nutrients such as n p and c under this scenario the significant reduction in bacterivorous at the outfall may result in lower predatory pressure on bacteria hence increase in ba abundance at the outfall site enhanced bacterial activity measured as bp at the outfall area could result from local eutrophication processes namely chemicals that were directly associated with the swro operation e g phosphonates based antiscalants and indirectly by mixing the desalination brine with nutrients from nearby well amelioration effluents abramson and shafir 2016 shafir and ben yosef 2017a and or by sewage discharge from nearby gaza powley et al 2016 it is also possible that the increase in water temperature compared to the reference station due to mixing the brine with power plant cooling water table 2 fig s1 may also spur bacterial production rates these increased bp rates resulted in high bge at the outfall site compared to the reference station fig 3d we suggest that enhanced bge may be explained by the increased synthesis of various high molecular weight osmo protective molecules such as glycine betaine ectoine and glycerol poli et al 2017 wilson et al 2009 these molecules provide electrolyte homeostasis and maintain the bacterial fluid balance under osmotic stresses frank et al 2017 this regulation mechanism can provide adaptive preference to benthic bacteria capable assimilating synthesizing such molecules thus thrive in elevated salinities that are often present near desalination outfall sites we stress that this subject should be reinforced in future dedicated studies such information will be highly important to the understanding of how benthic microbial communities cope with changing environmental conditions due to multi stressors from anthropogenic sources 3 2 2 sorek desalination facility ba in the sediment was 1 3 fold higher at the outfall area than the reference sites whereas bp remained unchanged fig 3a and b yet bcd was significantly different between the two sampling stations at the reference site bcd was higher by 1 8 fold compared to the outfall location fig 3c concurrently bge was higher by 2 fold at the outfall in respect to the reference site fig 3d these changes were mostly attributed to the higher respiration rates measured at the reference stations 2 85 0 73 μg c gr 1 d 1 compared with the outfall area 1 31 0 50 μg c gr 1 d 1 and to a lesser extent by the bp rates that remained overall similar fig 3b additionally phosphonates organic phosphate based molecules which are often used as antiscalants in the desalination process drami et al 2011 belkin et al 2017 petersen et al 2018 can be found at higher concentrations near the outfall area of sorek 0 4 0 7 μm compared to the typical background levels 0 1 μm kress et al 2016a b it is possible that br rates as well as concomitant bcd and bge can be affected due to higher phosphonate concentrations at the outfall site compared to the ambient environment we stress that biodegradation of phosphonates by benthic microbes should be studied in relation to the desalination process and especially in oligotrophic p limited systems such as the eastern mediterranean sea krom et al 2010 meiofauna abundance and community composition i e number of phyla were overall similar between the outfall and reference stations with 30 higher abundances at the outfall table s2 the moderate difference between the outfall and reference stations implies that the brine dispersion was more efficient than the coastal discharge at the ashkelon desalination facility 3 2 3 hadera desalination facility benthic ba was similar between the reference and outfall sites fig 3a however bp fig 3b and br table s1 were significantly higher by 1 6 fold and 1 7 fold respectively at the reference site relative to the outfall station hence bcd was up to 2 fold higher at the reference site than the discharge point fig 3c despite these changes in bcd no significant trends were found in bge fig 3d total meiofauna abundance and especially platyhelminthes flat worm counts were higher 2 and 6 fold respectively at the outfall area than the reference station table s2 overall our results suggest that the discharged brine near the hadera desalination plant had a local and moderate environmental effect on the benthic bacterial biomass and activity we suggest that these moderate effects resulted from efficient dilution of the brine with the cooling water of the adjacent power plant which occurs on land prior its discharge as well as additional mixing of the outlet with the hadera stream this is in contrary with the ashkelon desalination plant where the brine is discharged directly to the coastal environment and is being diluted in situ with cooling seawater of the nearby power plant we therefore find that the discharge method applied in hadera desalination facility inflicted less environmental impact on the benthic microbes i e on ba bp and community structure than the one used in ashkelon despite both being a coastal discharge 3 3 changes in bacterial community structure in respect to the outfall sites of large scale swro facilities 3 3 1 ashkelon desalination facility pcoa analyses indicated a significant change between the bacterial diversity at the outfall and the reference stations fig 4 a anosim p 0 049 these differences are in accordance with the changes found for the biomass and metabolic rate variables at this area fig 3 we suggest that bacterial succession occurred toward halophytic species in the outfall area compared to the native communities that inhabit the unaffected reference station indeed members of planctomycetes such as rhodopirellula baltica that increased in their relative otus abundance from the reference 1 to the outfall 12 areas fig 5 are known to be highly adaptive to high salinities of up to 60 wecker et al 2009 further proteobacterial phylotypes were higher in the outfall vs the reference stations 46 vs 29 fig 5 members of this phylum have the genetic capabilities to express osmoregulated periplasmic glucans and thus cope with hyper saline environments bontemps gallo et al 2013 moreover actinobacteria which are important nutrient recyclers in the benthos including of polyphosphates hupfer et al 2007 kong et al 2005 were higher in the outfall 9 than reference 2 stations fig 5 since polyphosphates are often used for the swro desalination process lattemann and höpner 2008 prihasto et al 2009 it is not surprising that this phylum exhibited high relative otu abundance near the outfall interestingly the ubiquitous archaea euryarchaeota were found in the reference stations 17 but were almost absent 0 4 from the outfall area fig 5 although it was reported that this phylum can survive at high salinities yakimov et al 2013 3 3 2 sorek desalination facility analysis of the bacterial relative otus indicated that the bacterial diversity was insignificantly different between the outfall and reference sites in the sorek desalination plant fig 4b anosim p 0 799 this was despite the significant differences in the metabolic rate measurements fig 3 as well as the evident differences in the relative otus abundance of most bacterial phylum fig 5 that exhibited some seasonal variations relative abundance of firmicutes was 9 fold higher in the outfall stations vs the reference stations this bacterial phylum is a known member in trace metals contaminated sediments dell anno et al 2012 it is possible that the use of fe based coagulants in the desalination process prihasto et al 2009 may favor the abundance of this bacterial phylotype actinobacteria and euryachaeota phyla also differed between sites where the relative abundance was 3 6 fold higher in the outfall area compared to the reference station differently planctomycetes which have a central role in benthic carbon cycling fuerst and sagulenko 2011 was abundant in the reference stations and nearly disappeared at the outfall sites fig 5 3 3 3 hadera desalination facility both the pcoa fig 4c anosim p 0 568 and the relative otus analyses fig 5c point that the benthic microbial communities in the reference and outfall sites of hadera were highly similar proteobacteria dominated the bacterial phylum 46 50 followed by acidobacteria 8 planctomycetes 7 9 and bacteroides 5 the only notable difference was for firmicutes where the relative abundance reduced from 9 at the reference stations to 3 at the outfall site the similar bacterial community structure suggests that the brine discharge method namely additional mixing of the brine with the hadera stream fig 1 reduced the environmental impact compared to the ashkelon desalination facility this was also in agreement with the moderate changes observed for ba bp and bge fig 3 4 conclusions extensive construction of large scale swro desalination facilities is highly common in many arid and coastal regions worldwide yet only limited environmental research was done to estimate the impact of desalination brine on adjacent coastal ecosystems and especially benthic bacteria that inhibit these areas our results indicate that benthic heterotrophic bacteria are affected by desalination brine these effects are often characterized by changes in bacterial abundance and bacterial activity resulting in altered bacterial carbon demand and growth efficiency in addition brine discharge may change the benthic bacterial community at the outfall area nevertheless we found that these impacts were site specific and highly local namely that the effects of swro brine on benthic bacteria were a combination of the discharge method used to disperse the brine at each site and the local stressors including i eutrophication from different anthropogenic sources i e amelioration wells and or sewage runoffs and ii possibly due elevated water temperatures after mixing with cooling water from power plants we also surmise that swro brine can indirectly affect the abundance of heterotrophic bacteria by reducing the number of higher trophic organisms such as bacteriovorus due to osmotic stress the reduction in bacterivorous abundance such as nematodes and foraminifers may lead to bacterial proliferation and changes in microbial food web structure we propose that long term effects of desalination brine on benthic bacteria could be minimized by discharging the concentrate via diffuser systems thus removing the dependency of brine dilution on power plant operation and cooling water capacity in addition reducing the use of power plants cooling water will decrease the differences between water temperature at the outfall area and the receiving environment additionally the impact of swro brine on benthic meiofauna as well as of eukaryotic algae should be studied in future research to better evaluate the ecological effects of the growing desalination industry on coastal ecosystems acknowledgments we would like to thank the

19088,eutrophication or excessive nutrient richness is an impairment of many freshwater ecosystems and a prominent cause of harmful algal blooms it is generally accepted that nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients are the primary causative factor however for systems subject to large anthropogenic perturbation this may no longer be true and the role of micronutrients is often overlooked here we report a study on lake tai taihu a large spatially diverse and hypereutrophic lake in china we performed small scale mesocosm nutrient limitation bioassays using boron iron cobalt copper molybdenum nitrogen and phosphorus on phytoplankton communities sampled from different locations in taihu to test the relative effects of micronutrients on in situ algal assemblages in addition to commonly used methods of chemical and biological analysis including algal phytoplankton counting we used flow cytometry coupled with data driven analysis to monitor changes to algal assemblages we found statistically significant effects of limitation or co limitation for boron cobalt copper and iron for copper at one location chlorophyll a was over four times higher for amendment with copper nitrogen and phosphorous than for the latter two alone since copper is often proposed as amendment for the environmental management of harmful algal blooms this result is significant we have three primary conclusions first the strong effects for cu that we report here are mutually consistent across chlorophyll a results count data and results determined from a data driven approach to flow cytometry given that we cannot rule out a role for a fe cu homeostatic link in causing these effects future research into mns and how they interact with n p and other mns should be pursued to explore new interventions for effective management of habs second in view of the stimulatory effect that cu exhibited management of habs with cu as an algal biocide may not always be advisable third our approach to flow cytometry offers data confirming our results from chemical and biological analysis however also holds promise for future development as a high throughput tool for use in understanding changes in algal assemblages the results from this study concur with a small and emerging body of literature suggesting that the potential role of micronutrients in eutrophication requires further consideration in environmental management graphical abstract image 1 keywords micronutrient limitation copper harmful algal bloom eutrophication lake flow cytometry 1 introduction lakes provide

georgakakis 2011 paerl et al 2015 xu et al 2010 and eutrophication anderson et al 2002 chaffin et al 2013 conley et al 2009 for many years p was thought to be the primary limiting nutrient in terrestrial freshwater systems correll 1998 schindler 1977 it may be that in an ideal and increasingly rare case of an anthropogenically undisturbed environment an assumption of p limitation would still prove valid increasingly however human activities are altering the earth s pre industrial balance of nine earth systems characterised as planetary boundaries at risk of irreversible and

important as p in the control of habs conley et al 2009 havens et al 2001 lewis et al 2011 lewis et al 2008 the fundamental need for micronutrients mn by algae is well known the seminal text edited by andersen 2005 on culturing algae lists boron b cobalt co copper cu iron fe molybdenum mo manganese mn selenium se vanadium v and zinc zn as important algal mns a 2008 review of mns in 56 freshwater lakes downs et al 2008 found that the proportion of the lakes analysed in which micronutrient limitation was found was 76 for molybdenum 74 for iron 67 for boron 67 for cobalt and 20 for copper overall limitation of the phytoplankton by one or more micronutrients was reported at least once for 82 of the lakes in the analysis these percentages are substantial by far the most study of mn limitation is for fe the literature for which is too substantial to review thoroughly here for algae iron is needed for essential metabolic functions in photosynthetic electron transport respiratory electron transport nitrate and nitrite reduction sulfate reduction nitrogen fixation and detoxifification of reactive oxygen species sunda et al 2005 cyanobacterial iron requirements are reported to exceed non photosynthetic prokaryotes by 10 fold and are described as exceptionally high even among other photosynthetic organisms kranzler et al 2013 moreno vivian et al 1999 due to mechanisms of intracellular homeostasis in these organisms in addition to studies that find fe limiting or co limiting in freshwaters de wever et al 2010 evans and prepas 1997 goldman 1972 ivanikova et al 2007 larson et al 2015 north et al 2008 stoddard 1987 twiss et al 2005 verschoor et al 2017 vrede and tranvik 2006 a number of studies have looked at the effect of dissolved organic matter particularly siderophores in affecting fe bioavailability sorichetti et al 2016 ward et al 2002 and hence algal community succession patterns molot et al 2010 murphy et al 1976 nagai et al 2006 pollingher et al 1995 sarkar et al 2016 another important line of enquiry concerns how fe p linked biogeochemistry e g vivianite formation dissolution causes fe limitation in some situations arbildua et al 2017 molot et al 2014 orihel et al 2016 reports indicate that in some cases a siderophore or p related dose response behaviour resembling toxicity is a consequence instead of the presence of these substances in concentrations that decrease fe bioavailability arbildua et al 2017 nagai et al 2006 ward et al 2002 other mns are less well studied than fe but have been shown to be variously limiting and co limiting as early as 1966 lewin published a study reporting b to be a requirement for algal growth generally lewin 1966 and several studies have since found b limitation or co limitation in lakes bayer et al 2008 bonilla et al 1990 downs et al 2008 hyenstrand et al 2001 both co and cu have been shown to be limiting and or colimiting at lower concentrations cavet et al 2003 chakraborty et al 2010 downs et al 2008 manahan and smith 1973 roussel et al 2007 sandmann and böger 1980 stoddard 1987 while both of these are trace metals at higher concentrations they behave as toxic heavy metals reportedly co is much less toxic to algae than cu chakraborty et al 2010 another mn of essential importance to algae is mo which is a cofactor in nitrogen reduction moreno vivian et al 1999 mo has been shown to be limiting and or colimiting axler et al 1980 downs et al 2008 glass et al 2010 2012 rueter and petersen 1987 song et al 2012 and at least one study reports mo limitation of nitrogen fixation in freshwater and coastal cyanophytes glass et al 2010 for a more detailed discussion of mo see rueter and petersen 1987 and references therein some studies report that intake of one nutrient might also affect the status of another as an example sterner et al 2004 observed that quantities of n or p that caused only a small increase in algal phytoplankton growth rates were nonetheless sufficient to induce fe limitation prior expectations for nutrient limitation have largely focused on p and more recently n however anthropogenic disturbances of global geochemical cycles entail that may not be reliable in the future and this will affect water resource management needs campbell et al 2017 conley et al 2009 lewis et al 2008 compared to n and p relatively little work has been done on the role of mns particularly in highly disturbed impacted systems here we report results from our work on the effects of mns on algae in lake tai taihu 太湖 in chinese china s third largest freshwater lake located in the yangtze river delta the most rapidly developing region in china qin et al 2007 taihu is of crucial importance in the region as a drinking water source for approximately 11 million people xu et al 2017 and with regard to flood control tourism and aquaculture gong and lin 2009 qin et al 2007 rapid development and lack of suitable environmental controls has led to large inputs of pollutants from industry and agricultural waste into taihu and its tributaries intensifying water quality deterioration wang et al 2009 ergo this previously oligotrophic diatom dominated lake chen et al 2003a 2003b is now subject to hypereutrophication and cyanobacterial habs have occurred every summer in the northern part of the lake since the mid 1980s qin et al 2007 during the summer of 1990 a large scale cyanobacterial hab occurred in taihu causing 116 factories to halt work guo 2007 xu et al 2010 in may 2007 another large scale hab incapacitated a drinking water plant leading to a water crisis in the city of wuxi population 4 million guo 2007 qin et al 2010 in recent years the extent of habs in taihu has expanded throughout the northern western and central regions of the lake from may through october every year qin et al 2007 and this intensity of anthropogenic disturbance to taihu makes it an interesting field site to study further a better understanding of the factors that promote habs is essential in order to protect the water resource studies on taihu often focus on the effects of n and p on algal growth paerl et al 2011 xu et al 2010 a recent study used short term nutrient limitation bioassays nlbs to study fe limitation of microcystis spp in taihu waters xu et al 2013 and found that fe was a limiting nutrient under some conditions so far the emphasis is on cyanobacterial growth as the major risk factor for habs in taihu chen et al 2003b liu et al 2011 paerl et al 2011 less emphasis has been on study of in situ algal assemblages with multiple species and phyla and no studies have evaluated the potential that other mns might play in nutrient limitation in taihu for this study we employed small scale mesocosm nlb experiments to examine the effects of fe cu co b and mo with and without addition of n and p on in situ algal assemblages in three regions of taihu that were differentially impacted by hab we characterised the effect of mns using traditional methods for chemical water quality and biological microscopic cell counting analysis we supplemented these studies using flow cytometry measurement fcm coupled with data driven analysis fcm is a high throughput technology offering rapid simultaneous quantification of multiple cellular characteristics the ability to measure six or more parameters simultaneously and measure tens of thousands of cells in a few minutes is attractive however this blessing of dimensionality or the ability to separate groups with higher dimensional data that are not otherwise separable is complemented by the curse of dimensionality donoho 2000 to deal with the curse of processing large amounts of multi dimensional data even today fcm data analysis typically utilises a process called gating which bashashati and brinkman 2009 in a recent review described thus gating is a highly subjective process in which the investigators determine the regions in multiparametric space that contain the interesting data based on their knowledge of the experimental factors and experience this is a tedious time consuming and often inaccurate task to serially select regions in one and two dimensional graphical representations of the data this low dimensional subsetting ignores the high dimensional multivariate nature of the data even relatively minor differences in gating can produce different quantitative results recently there has been a great deal of effort put into development of data driven approaches to fcm data analysis so that data analysis is driven by the structure of the data itself finak et al 2009 2010 rather than expert opinion finak and gottardo 2011 we use a data driven approach as an exploratory effort and to our knowledge we are the first to use such an approach to study changes in algal assemblages 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling sites taihu located in the south eastern region of the yangtze river delta lake center coordinates are 31 10ʹ0ʺn 120 90ʹ0ʺe is a large shallow eutrophic polymictic lake with 117 rivers and streams draining into it it has a mean depth of 2 m a surface area of 2338 km2 a volume of 4 4 billion m3 and a drainage basin of 36 500 km2 qin et al 2007 generally freshwater inputs enter the lake from the southwest or western mountainous watershed and the dominant discharge points are eastern taihu bay and the taipu river in the southeast of the lake basin the inputs drive high water turbidity with the occurrence of dense cyanobacterial habs and an absence of macrophytes from late spring through early fall in the north western region of taihu qin et al 2007 2010 xu et al 2010 the eastern region of the lake is less affected by habs and generally has relatively clear water floating and submersed macrophytes and diverse communities of invertebrates and fishes we conducted sampling at a time when an hab was fully developed in the western part of the lake and spreading east in order to perform nlb experiments when a range of conditions occur in the lake the three sites that we studied shown in fig 1 are situated in meiliang bay gonghu bay and xukou bay and are part of a long term monitoring programme meiliang bay station 3 is one of the lake s most eutrophic bays with high water turbidity and the occurrence of dense cyanobacterial habs particularly in summer large amounts of untreated wastewater from factories residential and agricultural areas are discharged into the bay by the liangxi and zhihu gang rivers and a strong algal bloom was present at the time of sampling for this study the west to east spread of hab is somewhat variable year to year and though we wanted to revisit the sites previously studied for fe limitation one of which was station 3 xu et al 2013 we found that the station in eastern taihu that these authors studied was already partially impacted by hab hence we sampled at the nearest eastern station that was not impacted station 28 xukou bay at the time of sampling gonghu bay station 13 was less affected by hab than station 3 at the time of sampling and was chosen as such 2 2 sample collection and water sample

analysis algal objects were counted from observations of samples sedimented in a sedgwick rafter chamber and reported as counts wang and wang 1982 the phytoplankton species were identified according to zhou and chen 2011 fcm spectral analysis of single cells was performed using a facscalibur becton dickinson california usa with two lasers argon solid state and red diode excitation at 488 and 635

nutrient limitation bioassay experiments nlb experiments were carried out immediately after sample collection and followed the method of paerl et al 2011 also see haraughty and burks 1996 whalen and benson 2007 and xu et al 2013 as examples for an expanded discussion of this type of experiment and its application please see the supplementary material sm for each nlb treatment triplicate water subsamples from each respective station were taken from the 40 l samples described in section 2 2 and placed into 1 l transparent chemically inert cubitainers that were trace metal clean as described in xu et al 2013 nutrient was then added to cubitainers by spiking with concentrated solution to achieve the final concentrations shown in table 1 for each treatment the treatments were control no nutrient additions n p combined n and p np single mns fe cu co b or mo and mn np fe np cu np co np b np or mo np each treatment was sampled twice once at 2 days once 4 days for analysis section 2 2 concentrations of n p np and fe were based on those used in previous work concentrations for other mns were initially targeted at four times projected ambient based on literature on taihu or according to other information in literature bayer et al 2008 procházková et al 2014 xu et al 2013 the chemical form see table 1 of treatments was designed to maximize bioavailability after nutrient additions the cubitainers were incubated in situ in taihu near the surface for four days by placing them in a frame at taihu laboratory for lake ecosystem research this nlb approach was developed to provide a rapid assessment of nutrient limitation characteristics paerl and bowles 1987 piehler et al 2009 xu et al 2010 and follows the preceding taihu work on fe limitation described in xu et al 2013 the approach functionally represents small mesocosm experiments that link the controlled nature of lab experiments with field experiments to capture ambient environmental conditions e g diel cycles temperature conditions as an exploratory study we chose this method to examine short term growth responses of algae as the issue of long term phytoplankton succession patterns is undoubtedly more complex 2 4 data analyses one way anova followed by tukey s honest significant difference hsd post hoc test was used to test for differences in chl a among treatments the r programming language and environment for statistical computing was used to perform calculations and the level of significance used was p 0 05 for all tests bretz et al 2011 additional tests for correlation were performed in microsoft excel pearson s r and spearman s nonparametric ρ to analyse fcm data we used flowmerge finak and gottardo 2011 which is part of the bioconductor software project for the analysis of fcm data huber et al 2015 flowmerge is an extension of the bioconductor flowclust algorithm finak et al 2009 flowclust is based on t mixture models with box cox transformation and when the number of clusters is not known a priori the bayesian information criterion bic is used to determine the most appropriate number of clusters inherent in the multi dimensional structure of fcm data lo et al 2008 2009 while this approach is used and works well in many applications it has been noted that the bic may overestimate cluster number because the number of mixture components needed to model data may be greater than justified by inherent difference in a sample baudry et al 2010 finak et al 2009 this issue has been addressed by application of the entropy based integrated completed likelihood criterion icl the icl has been shown to provide a better estimate of the number of clusters however is not a good model for the underlying data distribution baudry et al 2010 by combining the two approaches data is first clustered using the t mixture model with box cox transformation and subsequently the icl guides remerging mis split clusters arriving at a solution that has the suitable fitting properties and a number of clusters that is most likely to represent the number of different types of cells populations present in a sample finak et al 2009 3 results and discussion 3 1 initial conditions and water quality results from water quality analysis shown in table 2 confirm that the three different stations had different initial conditions turbidity nutrients tn tdn nh4 n tp tdp srp doc and chl a are highest for station 3 intermediate for station 13 and lowest for station 28 some mn concentrations follow this trend tdfe are relatively high and within the range that a previous study found for station 3 10 106 μg l but are considerably higher than that study found in the eastern part of the lake below detection to 3 μg l xu et al 2013 other mn values are reasonably low or below detection as may occur with trace quantities the nutrients tn and tp are both dominated by organic forms the majority of which is particulate for n and presumably p as well though there is a small diminution in the percentage of organic forms from station 3 to station 28 doc follows that pattern and since the predominant drainage pattern and hab pattern is from west to east these results are as expected most other nutrient forms follow this pattern however within analytical uncertainty no3 n is low and essentially static the tn tp ratios are similar for stations 3 and 13 and higher for station 28 and tdn tdp ratios are both a factor of 2 less than the tdn tdp ratio for station 28 there have been reports detailing the ability of cyanobacteria to flourish at low tn tp ratios schindler 1977 smith 1983 the high ph of taihu is notable and perhaps the best indicator of the degree of its anthropogenic perturbation the high ph has been attributed to inorganic carbon scavenging of phytoplankton as a result of habs part of a vicious cycle conveying competitive advantage on bloom forming species wang et al 2017 this ph may substantively reduce the bioavailability of mns due to the formation of bis hydroxy and or carbonato complexes at high ph that is expected theoretically and has been demonstrated experimentally kim et al 1999 o shea and mancy 1978 consistent with prior recent reports we found that the phytoplankton in taihu were variable across the lake dominated by cyanophyta blue green algae cyanobacteria bacilliarophyta diatoms chlorophyta green algae cryptophyta and euglenophyta chen et al 2003b xu et al 2013 fig 2 shows pie charts with the relative percentages of each phylum and the total counts for each station station 3 and station 13 were dominated by cyanophyta 90 of total counts however for station 3 82 of all cyanophytes chroococcus microcystis nostoc and oscillaria spp were microcystis by count whereas for station 13 90 of all cyanophytes were nostoc spp by count microcystis and nostoc are non nitrogen fixing and nitrogen fixing genera respectively which may affect phytoplankton growth differently between these two stations station 28 was dominated by bacilliarophyta the total counts for station 13 are approximately three times that of station 3 whereas the inverse is true for chl a between the two stations the results in table 2 and fig 2 are consistent with the frequent summer trend in taihu wherein nutrient enrichment followed by an hab begins in the western side of the lake and spreads to the east over the course or the summer

average increase of chl a by 220 with rsds exceeding 100 a one way anova tukey s hsd post hoc test was performed showing some significant p 0 05 pair wise differences treatment compared to control or np indicated by asterisks in fig 3 for station 3 few differences are seen and only at day 2 for p n np b and fe np both b and fe have previously been reported to increase microcystis growth gerloff 1968 srivastava et al 2016 while np exhibited the highest chl a relative to the control by day 2 by day 4 it appears that np has accelerated the onset of senescence a term representing a range of processes mostly in reference to declining degrading chl a associated with late stationary lysis phases resulting from environmental stresses such as nutrient limitation louda et al 1998 station 3 had the highest nutrients and initial concentrations of chl a and on an absolute basis there is a trend of chl a diminution over 4 days with an inverse correlation r 2 0 80 between δchl a0 2d and δchl a2 4d this observation fits with the idea that for a late stationary assemblage less nutritive treatments e g the control in fig 3c result in progressive senescence or decline decreasing growth curve slope with a diminishing rate of change whereas more nutritive treatments cause partial reinvigoration or at least retard the onset of senescence flat to increasing growth curve slope as for np mn np treatments in fig 3c with subsequent senescence after nutrient exhaustion in terms of growth curve behaviour larger nutrient concentrations result in larger changes in curvature rate of change in comparison to lower concentrations gough et al 2015 lee et al 2000 pinna et al 2015 more discussion of growth curve slopes is provided in the sm along with an illustrative schematic station 3 was highly impacted by an hab during the time of this study the results indicate that np mn np and to a lesser extent b have the most effect in supporting the persistence of the hab in actual lake conditions microcystis can vertically migrate throughout the shallow water column optimizing its ability to access favorable conditions to proliferate which in turn increases its lateral extent smaller differences we see in mesocosm nlbs might be larger in an open lake for the data in fig 3c also see fig 3f and i pearson s r and spearman s ρ are given in the figure caption for a further discussion of fig 3 results and results from additional statistical tests see the sm the station 13 trend for n and p is similar overall to that of station 3 in that the order of effect relative to the control is np n p fig 3 albeit the pattern persists to day 4 treatments of mn only statistically exceed control np treatment for cu and fe np day 2 and cu np day 4 while for most mn mn np relative chl a decreases from day 2 to day 4 the behaviour of cu cu np is strikingly different with chl a concentrations increasing for cu by 61 and cu np by 11 from day 2 to day 4 relative to the control and np respectively for the scatter plot showing δchl a0 2d versus δchl a2 4d for station 13 fig 3f both visually and in terms of r 2 there appears to be two groups with an inverse linear relationship the first group is the no growth group though r 2 0 86 it may be more appropriate to view this group as tightly clustered the second group is all of the remaining treatments for this group the np mn np treatments show growth during over first two days positive growth curve slope i e a negative δchl a0 2d value followed by diminution as nutrients have become exhausted whereas cu and p show diminution in chl a over the first two days with a net increase thereafter we posit that as for station 3 the standing stock for station 13 is at or nearing decline and while the np treatments provoke a reasonably rapid response p and cu may undergo lag i e the changes are suggestive of adjustment and or decline of the standing stock followed by growth for station 28 changes for n and p are not significantly different from the control however np together has chl a that is almost 10 times that of the control days 2 and 4 interestingly by day 2 for all mn np treatments the response is less than that of np alone with cu np being a pronounced factor of 4 9 lower the lower response for single mn is not generalisable though the response for cu alone is also much lower 2 7 times less than the control by day 4 all of the control normalized single mn treatments have increased compared to their values on day 2 and mn np treatments are all larger than np significantly so for co and cu the treatment cu np has the most pronounced differential effect and is 4 times greater than for np with a 22 fold increase from day 2 to day 4 the scatter plot for station 28 fig 3i lends the appearance of different behaviours 1 c n p fe co b and mo 2 cu np fe np co np b np and mo np and 3 cu np in a class of its own changes for the first group are small and consist of a near constant δchl a0 2d followed by small and variable increases in δchl a2 4d the second group follows the inverse relationship discussed previously for stations 3 and 13 wherein those greatest increases in δchl a0 2d positive growth curve slope are followed by smaller δchl a2 4d in the case of station 28 possibly indicating onset of stationary phase rather than senescence and vice versa overall we observe trends in fig 3c f and i that are rationalizable in terms of algal growth curves see sm and appear to result in different groupings based on the initial condition of standing stocks and the relative nutrient value of different treatments the similarity between pearson s r and spearman s ρ are in most cases in good agreement except when including cu np for station 28 for station 28 filled markers in fig 3i spearman s ρ indicates a strong monotonic if not linear relationship when including cu np with respect to n p and np the results herein present a unified picture for the stations sampled spanning the width of taihu wherein np are co limiting nutrients for habs in agreement with previous studies dzialowski et al 2005 paerl et al 2015 xu et al 2013 yang et al 2017 while there is an increasing awareness that mns and the bioavailability of trace metals play important roles in the carbon and nitrogen metabolism of algae baptista and vasconcelos 2006 berman frank et al 2001 juneja et al 2013 romero et al 2013 the state of knowledge is as yet immature and our primary purpose for this work was to ascertain whether mns would exhibit effects in a highly disturbed and frequently hypereutrophic system as taihu the statistically significant results in fig 3 indicate that mns may serve both as primary and as co limiting nutrients in some cases results for cu cu np stations 13 and 28 are most marked and fe np shows effects for two stations 3 and 13 for station 28 cu cu np appeared to show an inhibitory effect at day 2 whereas by day 4 the maximum increase observed during this study was for cu np it has long been known that at high enough concentrations cu is an algal biocide and cu2 has even been suggested for use in environmental management of habs at concentrations ranging from 90 to 500 μg l källqvist and meadows 1978 wu et al 2017 likewise the importance of cu as a mn for algae has long been recognised manahan and smith 1973 because mn such as cu are required in very small amounts in the whole algae life cycle there is frequently only a very small difference between a nutritional growth promoting effect and cell toxicity procházková et al 2014 the effect of cu np in station 28 is unique to our knowledge in the literature there is some possibility that the cu effect relates to fe there has been a growing amount of research into bacterial and algal production of copper binding ligands called chalkophores and copper binding siderophores these ligands have demonstrated importance in controlling the bioavailability of cu and may aid organisms to regulate cu uptake and navigate a narrow divide between nutrition and toxicity johnstone and nolan 2015 regarding a linked effect with fe as early as 1980 mcknight and morel 1980 published findings wherein fe limitation resulted in strong secretion of chalkophores by two anabaena species they speculated that cu complexes formed with such ligands were likely non toxic and might convey an advantage to cyanophyte populations subsequently genetic regulatory links between cu and fe homeostasis in cyanophytes have been discovered for example based on genetic studies employing site directed mutagenesis nicolaisen et al 2010 have developed a model wherein schizokinen a siderophore secreted by anabaena spp is produced and exported under low fe or high cu conditions when the concentrations of both fe and cu are low schizokinen complexes with fe increasing fe bioavailability to the organism at high cu low fe concentrations schizokinen complexes cu in a manner protective to the organism and another fe transporter is activated these findings are analogous to findings for p aeruginosa wherein exposure to toxic cu concentrations resulted in the differential production of siderophores such that a more cu protective effect bioavailability reduction is favoured braud et al 2010 in this study the ambient tdfe for station 28 averages half that of the other stations table 2 since the high chl a response of cu np appears previously undocumented some phytoplankton reportedly have a relatively high cellular fe requirement brand 1991 and the low solubility of environmentally prevalent fe3 reduces fe bioavailability we cannot rule out that cu treatment induced increased fe bioavailability followed by growth 3 3 effects of micronutrient supply on changes in algal assemblages our purpose in using in situ algae was to investigate if any changes in algal assemblages might be observed and if there might be clues as to mn s mediating conditions favouring microcystis over other algae figs 4 6 showing the changing proportions of algae in response to mn treatments disaggregated counts for all species including species with very low frequency are given in the sm while count data give a sense of changes some species quantified are colonial and some are not counting methods address this arguably not very successfully rott et al 2007 thus here we take a semi quantitative rather than statistical approach for station 3 changes in total counts and algal assemblages are relatively small cyanophytes remain dominant with microcystis spp averaging 88 of the total cyanophyte counts fig 4 by day 4 the total counts for both cyanophyta and chlorophyta were larger for the single mn treatments in comparison to the corresponding mn nps consistent with the effects discussed for chl a with respect to np while cyanophyta predominated initially for station 13 followed by bacillariophyta then chlorophtya the dominant genus was nostoc spp and changes to the algal populations of station 13 in response to mn treatment present a more complex picture than that of station 3 fig 5 the stairstep pattern of cyanophyta bacillariophyta chlorophtya in the initial water persisted in the control over 4 days however the percentage of cyanophytes in the control shifted from 81 nostoc spp 7 microcystis spp initially to 19 nostoc 39 microcystis by day 2 and 12 nostoc 37 microcystis by day 4 this transition from nostoc to microcystis occurred in all treatments as well with varying percentages the stairstep distribution was observed for the all non np treatments in day 2 for np treatments by day 2 there was a consistent increase of chlorophtya relative to bacillariophyta with abundance of chlorophtyes being similar or exceeding that of bacillariophytes a shift which continued to day 4 when all np mn np treatments save cu np were dominated by cyanophytes however chlorophytes had become more abundant than bacillariophytes the change for cu np was dramatic with chlorophyta becoming 89 a strikingly apparent visual change under the microscope also by day 4 the most abundant form of cyanophyte was chroococcus spp for cu np and scenedesmus spp abundance was 78 over four times that of any other treatment for stations 3 and 13 chroococcus abundance only reached double digits for cu station 3 and 13 and cu np in station 13 notable changes in phytoplankton assemblages in single mn treatments were observed for cu and co in the case of cu by day 4 the pattern mimicked that of cu np wherein chlorophytes were dominant followed by cyanophytes most common form chroococcus then bacillariophytes for co by day 4 bacillariophyta became the most abundant type outnumbering cyanophyta for station 28 the dominant algae in the water column initially were bacilliarophytes melosira spp 77 see sm with another 11 and 4 respectively of cyanophytes and chlorophytes fig 6 for most treatments the pattern of abundance was bacillariophyta melosira followed by cyanophyta or chlorophyta in some cases control n np fe np cu cu np co np b np mo np chlorophyta were more prevalent than cyanophyta cyanophytes were mostly microcystis except for cu cu np the only treatments that had double digit abundance of chroococcus 13 the day 2 total counts for both cu and cu np were lower than for any other treatment and cu np was the only treatment wherein chlorophytes dominated followed by bacillariophyta then cyanophyta for the original station 28 water the small amount of chlorophytes present was equally distributed between chlorella and pediastrum spp by day 2 the proportion was the same for cu and cu np had twice the amount of the latter as the former by day 4 cu np chlorophyta was dominated by scenedesmus spp 24 the only treatment to have more than 4 the pattern of abundance by phylum was not greatly changed by day 4 for some treatments control n p all of the single mn treatments except for cu for np fe np and cu np cyanophytes had become the dominant species also having a high abundance in cu and for np and cu np bacillariophyta became a minor component the treatments np fe np cu and cu np at day 4 were the only ones to have chroococcus spp 30 or greater 30 29 37 56 respectively see sm the treatments co np b np and mo np all showed a similar pattern at 4 days bacillariophyta dominant followed by cyanophyta then chlorophyta with relatively elevated total counts these treatments were also distinguished by relatively high amounts of synedra spp 69 75 and 84 respectively averaging 2 5 times the highest of all other treatments see sm results from count data are in general accord with chl a data in that station 3 is relatively static and for stations 13 and 28 more and varied changes occur reflecting potentially complicated succession patterns that depend on the relative distribution of the different species at the start of our experiments and how each respond to treatment chlorophyta or bacillariophyta are able in some cases to expand at the expense of cyanophyta for cu cu np and co in station 13 the most notable change occurring for stations 13 and 28 is for cu treatment singly or with np for both stations much higher amounts of pediastrum and or scenedesmus species thought to be relatively more tolerant and or needing cu bilgrami and kumar 1997 merchant 1998 appear by day 4 for cu np and to a lesser extent cu for station 13 microcystis diminishes from day 2 to day 4 for cu cu np whereas the opposite occurs for station 28 the largest increases for microcystis in station 28 occur for np fe np cu and cu np in view of the relative sensitivity of microcystis to cu horne and goldman 1974 zeng et al 2010 the potential role of cu and fe affecting the bioavailability of each other as discussed for chl a in section 3 2 the lower amount of fe in the ambient water of station 28 and the contrasting effect of cu cu np on microcystis in stations 13 versus 28 this again raises the question of to what extent changes seen for cu relate to fe the present results also underscore the desirability of trying to understand how mns affect succession patterns 3 4 flow cytometry analysis to determine changing characteristics of algal populations fcm is a promising tool to study changes in size abundance and community composition we used fcm in two ways 1 for univariate analysis performing estimation of biovolumes and analysis of the fl3 chl a channel in comparison to bulk chl a analysis and 2 for data driven multivariate analysis we review the major findings of multivariate analysis here as we believe it to the most important contribution to the literature the results of univariate analysis along with detailed comments on multivariate analysis are included in the sm for brevity clustering algorithms are fundamental in the quest to automate analysis of fcm data johnsson et al 2016 the data driven approach that we use here is more robust to handling difficult clustering issues in fcm to provide a final number of clusters most likely representing the number of different types of cells or populations that are separable distinct in a sample finak and gottardo 2011 we tried a number of algorithms busam et al 2007 han et al 2011 lo et al 2008 zare et al 2010 however flowmerge was superior in consistent reproducibility across treatments stations and sampling periods to perform clustering we took fcm data files and visually inspected bivariate plots confirming a large number of changes as a function of time and treatment next we performed clustering on each data file clusters are characterised in terms of cluster centers which is the average value of each of the fcm channels for a given cluster fsc ssc fl1 caroteniod fl2 pe fl3 chl a fl4 apc per section 2 2 for the triplicate samples the average proportion of each cluster and value of each fcm channel was plotted as a function of time three main types of cluster cluster 1 c1 cluster 2 c2 and cluster 3 c3 occur reproducibly c1 and c2 were detected in most samples c1 is characterised by relative to the other clusters a high ssc to fsc ratio and very low fl values across all channels c2 has relatively a high fsc to ssc ratio and moderate fl across all channels c3 is a cluster that appears in many treatments at days 2 and 4 and is characterised by having smaller fsc than c2 smaller ssc than c1 and fl generally higher than c1 but lower than c2 often the flowmerge algorithm finak and gottardo 2011 that we used identified many more clusters than these three however as some of these do not appear with high frequency represent very small proportions of the sample and often do not cluster repeatably across replicate samples we do not discuss them further fig 7 shows some representative fcm contour plots how these compare to cluster plots the total number of bivariate plots was 3825 see sm for additional selected examples and some examples of how clusters change as a function of time see sm for the full 63 plots of this data examination of the bivariate contour plots that we constructed in comparison to clustering data suggests that for c1 and especially c2 there might be more structure in some results than are differentiable by data driven clustering these buried clusters likely represent different algal species phyla dennis et al 2011 franklin et al 2010 peniuk et al 2016 regarding c1 fcm reports of features with very low fluorescence for algal samples describe these features in two ways near zero fluorescence that is characteristic of bacterial heterotrophs and very low fluorescence signals from algal sources such as debris or compromised cells that have variously been described as shrunken cells with high granularity ssc cells that have lost membrane integrity or cells that have been verified to be dead huang et al 2015 lopes da silva et al 2018 wang et al 2016 for those samples dominated by c1 and c2 e g our initial water samples c2 is everything else i e predominately cells in the exponential or stationary phase of growth we observe that c3 is not present in stations 3 13 or 28 initially and is only present in some day 2 and day 4 samples for which active growth is likely occurring ssc may increase disproportionately to fsc for dead or dying cells however for growing cells fsc and ssc are expected to increase together larger objects scatter more than smaller in the forward and side directions it is also possible that internal cell structure changes cause variations in ssc signal overall c3 s modest fsc ssc and fl signatures imply small but living cells the small fsc denoting small er relative size small ssc resulting from smaller side scatter of a small object and small fl resulting from a smaller volume of pigment contained in small cells we posit that c3 is newly divided or induction early exponential phase cells clustering results for station 3 shows the least variability for greater detail on clustering results see sm changes to c1 are modest for c2 by day 4 n np and np mn treatments see overall a slight decrease over this time the biggest loss is 12 for np corresponding to the appearance of c3 for these treatments the highest proportion of c3 is np np had notably low bulk chl a by day 4 the very low bulk chl a in day 4 for np may be related to this treatment s having the highest loss of c2 for np the most fluorescent cluster and greatest gain of c3 the cu np clustering is the only one to show a consistent rise in fsc and all fl channels between day 2 and day 4 for station 13 changes to c1 are similar as for station 3 and losses in c2 translate to gains in c3 by day 4 the proportion of c2 in cu and cu np treatments has decreased by 30 and 32 respectively which are the only treatments to have proportions of c2 less than the control only 20 of the cu treatment population is in c2 by day 2 less than half the initial proportion by day 4 c3 has appeared for all np mn np clusters and cu the proportion of all c3 clusters except cu and cu np is 5 whereas for cu and cu np it is 10 and 28 respectively overall the observations appear consistent with bulk chl a results though the relationship is complex see sm for further comments on fl3 versus chl a and how chl a relates to clustering results for station 28 the proportion of c1 is highest initially 73 and is diminishing much more strongly in comparison to stations 3 and 13 by day 4 c1 had disappeared for the treatments co co np b b np and mo np for all other treatments save n and p the c1 proportion diminished to 10 with n having the highest proportion of c1 at 16 the changes in proportion for c2 are most extreme of the three stations and are mirrored by c3 over the first two days of treatment proportions of c2 decrease from 23 to 4 6 for cu and cu np remain in the region of starting conditions for p and for all other treatments a marked increase in the proportion of c2 by an integer factor of 2 3 is observed by day 4 c3 appears in all treatments however the proportions of c3 for cu and cu np 60 70 are twice that of the remaining treatment c3s 11 29 a number of other changes are seen see sm one notable one is that for c3 cu np fsc increases by a factor of approximately 2 5 from day 2 to day 4 and ssc increases by a factor of 4 both of which are by far the largest relative increases for these clustering results are consistent with other results however provide a different perspective for example np in station 3 cu cu np in stations 13 and 28 and co np b np and mo np in station 28 show distinct differences in chl a and or counts that are also apparent in clustering notably cu np behaviour was different in clustering across all stations and the behaviour particularly for station 28 suggests that this treatment is causing a rapid diminution in standing stocks c2 with rapid new growth c3 thereafter we have posited that the effect of cu might relate to fe bioavailability however the clustering result suggests another possibility cu sensitive populations are inhibited while less cu sensitive populations obtain competitive advantage and grow rapidly in the presence of np this would be consistent with changes in assemblages seen from count data for station 13 cu np did not favour microcystis however for station 28 it did we have found only one report detailing longer term studies on the effect of cu addition zhao et al 2009 and this report found that cu does discourage cyanobacteria for a limited time after which cyanobacterial hab conditions return the question of how cu mediates shifts in assemblages and whether this relates to fe is an interesting topic for further study as our use of a data driven approach to fcm analysis of phytoplankton is new we had no expectations about what we might find we did not find linkages pointing to contributions of species phyta this requires authentic samples posing issues in terms of whether algal cultures are truly axenic whether culture collection strains are representative of in situ counterparts and whether the effect of distortions imposed by environmental conditions are mimicked in authentic samples we did find that the results from clustering of fcm data are in many ways in accord with other findings for initial water quality chl a changes and changes in phytoplankton assemblage station 3 represents one endpoint in terms of initial water quality and shows the smallest overall changes in chl a and phytoplankton assemblages station 28 is in most ways the diametric opposite with lower initial concentrations of most constituents analysed and having chl a and phytoplankton assemblages that changed the most and quite variably in response to treatment station 13 is intermediate to stations 3 and 13 based on our results it would be reasonable to characterize response to treatment as what is mathematically referred to as an initial value problem initial water quality parameters and phytoplankton assemblages determine the trajectory of change and a change in the status quo can potentially result in dramatic outcomes e g cu np in station 28 given the high efficiency with which data driven fcm can be performed we will pursue further studies in future to develop and better understand the utility of this approach 4 conclusions the results presented here show that mn treatment effects on algae varied spatially and among algal groups in taihu with key points being as follows there is a growing body of molecular biological data vida supra that documents homeostatic links between mns herein we discuss fe and cu and possible mechanisms of molecular control of the bioavailability of mns simultaneously there is an emerging body of literature 1 documenting the importance of fe in controlling algal phytoplankton growth and 2 propounding the use of cu as an algal biocide given the strong effects for cu that we report here are mutually consistent through the chl a count and fcm data and given that we cannot rule out a role for fe in causing these effects more research into mns and how they interact with n p and other mns should be pursued to explore new interventions for effective management of habs notably the very nature of the micro in micronutrient may hold promise as being more amenable to intervention for instance to help one species outcompete another over regional scales in view of the stimulatory effect that cu exhibited inclusive of the cyanobacteria microcystis spp management of habs with cu as an algal biocide may be inadvisable the data in our study are not sufficiently exhaustive to demonstrate that copper sulfate treatments and the resulting copper concentrations in treated water have the potential to promote microcystis growth however they do lend basis for invoking the best practice precautionary principle in environmental management a better understanding of the role of cu in affecting algal phytoplankton is needed before implementing its widespread use in an environment where it might stimulate growth rather than retard it results from data driven analysis of fcm are in accord with the chl a and counting data and this approach holds promise for development of more

19088,eutrophication or excessive nutrient richness is an impairment of many freshwater ecosystems and a prominent cause of harmful algal blooms it is generally accepted that nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients are the primary causative factor however for systems subject to large anthropogenic perturbation this may no longer be true and the role of micronutrients is often overlooked here we report a study on lake tai taihu a large spatially diverse and hypereutrophic lake in china we performed small scale mesocosm nutrient limitation bioassays using boron iron cobalt copper molybdenum nitrogen and phosphorus on phytoplankton communities sampled from different locations in taihu to test the relative effects of micronutrients on in situ algal assemblages in addition to commonly used methods of chemical and biological analysis including algal phytoplankton counting we used flow cytometry coupled with data driven analysis to monitor changes to algal assemblages we found statistically significant effects of limitation or co limitation for boron cobalt copper and iron for copper at one location chlorophyll a was over four times higher for amendment with copper nitrogen and phosphorous than for the latter two alone since copper is often proposed as amendment for the environmental management of harmful algal blooms this result is significant we have three primary conclusions first the strong effects for cu that we report here are mutually consistent across chlorophyll a results count data and results determined from a data driven approach to flow cytometry given that we cannot rule out a role for a fe cu homeostatic link in causing these effects future research into mns and how they interact with n p and other mns should be pursued to explore new interventions for effective management of habs second in view of the stimulatory effect that cu exhibited management of habs with cu as an algal biocide may not always be advisable third our approach to flow cytometry offers data confirming our results from chemical and biological analysis however also holds promise for future development as a high throughput tool for use in understanding changes in algal assemblages the results from this study concur with a small and emerging body of literature suggesting that the potential role of micronutrients in eutrophication requires further

overall limitation of the phytoplankton by one or more micronutrients was reported at least once for 82 of the lakes in the analysis these percentages are substantial by far the most study of mn limitation is for fe the literature for which is too substantial to review thoroughly here for algae iron is needed for essential metabolic functions in photosynthetic electron transport respiratory electron transport nitrate and nitrite reduction sulfate reduction nitrogen fixation and detoxifification of reactive oxygen species sunda et al 2005 cyanobacterial iron requirements are reported to exceed non photosynthetic prokaryotes by 10 fold and are described as exceptionally high even among other photosynthetic organisms kranzler et al 2013 moreno vivian et al 1999 due to mechanisms of intracellular homeostasis in these organisms in addition to studies that find fe limiting or co limiting in freshwaters de wever et al 2010 evans and prepas 1997 goldman 1972 ivanikova et al 2007 larson et al 2015 north et al 2008 stoddard 1987 twiss et al 2005 verschoor et al 2017 vrede and tranvik 2006 a number of studies have looked at the effect of dissolved organic matter particularly siderophores in affecting fe bioavailability sorichetti et al 2016 ward et al 2002 and hence algal community succession patterns molot et al 2010 murphy et al 1976 nagai et al 2006 pollingher et al 1995 sarkar et al 2016 another important line of enquiry concerns how fe p linked biogeochemistry e g vivianite formation dissolution causes fe limitation in some situations arbildua et al 2017 molot et al 2014 orihel et al 2016 reports indicate that in some cases a siderophore or p related dose response behaviour resembling toxicity is a consequence instead of the presence of these substances in concentrations that decrease fe bioavailability arbildua et al 2017 nagai et al 2006 ward et al 2002 other mns are less well studied than fe but have been shown to be variously limiting and co limiting as early as 1966 lewin published a study reporting b to be a requirement for algal growth generally lewin 1966 and several studies have since found b limitation or co limitation in lakes bayer et al 2008 bonilla et al 1990 downs et al 2008 hyenstrand et al 2001 both co and cu have been shown to be limiting and or colimiting at lower concentrations cavet et al 2003 chakraborty et al 2010 downs et al 2008 manahan and smith 1973 roussel et al 2007 sandmann and böger 1980 stoddard 1987 while both of these are trace metals at higher concentrations they behave as toxic heavy metals reportedly co is much less toxic to algae than cu chakraborty et al 2010 another mn of essential importance to algae is mo which is a cofactor in nitrogen reduction moreno vivian et al 1999 mo has been shown to be limiting and or colimiting axler et al 1980 downs et al 2008 glass et al 2010 2012 rueter and petersen 1987 song et al 2012 and at least one study reports mo limitation of nitrogen fixation in freshwater and coastal cyanophytes glass et al 2010 for a more detailed discussion of mo see rueter and petersen 1987 and references therein some studies report that intake of one nutrient might also affect the status of another as an example sterner et al 2004 observed that quantities of n or p that caused only a small increase in algal phytoplankton growth rates were nonetheless sufficient to induce fe limitation prior expectations for nutrient limitation have largely focused on p and more recently n however anthropogenic disturbances of global geochemical cycles entail that may not be reliable in the future and this will affect water resource management needs campbell et al 2017 conley et al 2009 lewis et al 2008 compared to n and p relatively little work has been done on the role of mns particularly in highly disturbed impacted systems here we report results from our work on the effects of mns on algae in lake tai taihu 太湖 in chinese china s third largest freshwater lake located in the yangtze river delta the most rapidly developing region in china qin et al 2007 taihu is of crucial importance in the region as a drinking water source for approximately 11 million people xu et al 2017 and with regard to flood control tourism and aquaculture gong and lin 2009 qin et al 2007 rapid development and lack of suitable environmental controls has led to large inputs of pollutants from industry and agricultural waste into taihu and its tributaries intensifying water quality deterioration wang et al 2009 ergo this previously oligotrophic diatom dominated lake chen et al 2003a 2003b is now subject to hypereutrophication and cyanobacterial habs have occurred every summer in the northern part of the lake since the mid 1980s qin et al 2007 during the summer of 1990 a large scale cyanobacterial hab occurred in taihu causing 116 factories to halt work guo 2007 xu et al 2010 in may 2007 another large scale hab incapacitated a drinking water plant leading to a water crisis in the city of wuxi population 4 million guo 2007 qin et al 2010 in recent years the extent of habs in taihu has expanded throughout the northern western and central regions of the lake from may through october every year qin et al 2007 and this intensity of anthropogenic disturbance to taihu makes it an interesting field site to study further a better understanding of the factors that promote habs is essential in order to protect the water resource studies on taihu often focus on the effects of n and p on algal growth paerl et al 2011 xu et al 2010 a recent study used short term nutrient limitation bioassays nlbs to study fe limitation of microcystis spp in taihu waters xu et al 2013 and found that fe was a limiting nutrient under some conditions so far the emphasis is on cyanobacterial growth as the major risk factor for habs in taihu chen et al 2003b liu et al 2011 paerl et al 2011 less emphasis has been on study of in situ algal assemblages with multiple species and phyla and no studies have evaluated the potential that other mns might play in nutrient limitation in taihu for this study we employed small scale mesocosm nlb experiments to examine the effects of fe cu co b and mo with and without addition of n and p on in situ algal assemblages in three regions of taihu that were differentially impacted by hab we characterised the effect of mns using traditional methods for chemical water quality and biological microscopic cell counting analysis we supplemented these studies using flow cytometry measurement fcm coupled with data driven analysis fcm is a high throughput technology offering rapid simultaneous quantification of multiple cellular characteristics the ability to measure six or more parameters simultaneously and measure tens of thousands of cells in a few minutes is attractive however this blessing of dimensionality or the ability to separate groups with higher dimensional data that are not otherwise separable is complemented by the curse of dimensionality donoho 2000 to deal with the curse of processing large amounts of multi dimensional data even today fcm data analysis typically utilises a process called gating which bashashati and brinkman 2009 in a recent review described thus gating is a highly subjective process in which the investigators determine the regions in multiparametric space that contain the interesting data based on their knowledge of the experimental factors and experience this is a tedious time consuming and often inaccurate task to serially select regions in one and two dimensional graphical representations of the data this low dimensional subsetting ignores the high dimensional multivariate nature of the data even relatively minor differences in gating can produce different quantitative results recently there has been a great deal of effort put into development of data driven approaches to fcm data analysis so that data analysis is driven by the structure of the data itself finak et al 2009 2010 rather than expert opinion finak and gottardo 2011 we use a data driven approach as an exploratory effort and to our knowledge we are the first to use such an approach to study changes in algal assemblages 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling sites taihu located in the south eastern region of the yangtze river delta lake center coordinates are 31 10ʹ0ʺn 120 90ʹ0ʺe is a large shallow eutrophic polymictic lake with 117 rivers and streams draining into it it has a mean depth of 2 m a surface area of 2338 km2 a volume of 4 4 billion m3 and a drainage basin of 36 500 km2 qin et al 2007 generally freshwater inputs enter the lake from the southwest or western mountainous watershed and the dominant discharge points are eastern taihu bay and the taipu river in the southeast of the lake basin the inputs drive high water turbidity with the occurrence of dense cyanobacterial habs and an absence of macrophytes from late spring through early fall in the north western region of taihu qin et al 2007 2010 xu et al 2010 the eastern region of the lake is less affected by habs and generally has relatively clear water floating and submersed macrophytes and diverse communities of invertebrates and fishes we conducted sampling at a time when an hab was fully developed in the western part of the lake and spreading east in order to perform nlb experiments when a range of conditions occur in the lake the three sites that we studied shown in fig 1 are situated in meiliang bay gonghu bay and xukou bay and are part of a long term monitoring programme meiliang bay station 3 is one of the lake s most eutrophic bays with high water turbidity and the occurrence of dense cyanobacterial habs particularly in summer large amounts of untreated wastewater from factories residential and agricultural areas are discharged into the bay by the liangxi and zhihu gang rivers and a strong algal bloom was present at the time of sampling for this study the west to east spread of hab is somewhat variable year to year and though we wanted to revisit the sites previously studied for fe limitation one of which was station 3 xu et al 2013 we found that the station in eastern taihu that these authors studied was already partially impacted by hab hence we sampled at the nearest eastern station that was not impacted station 28 xukou bay at the time of sampling gonghu bay station 13 was less affected by hab than station 3 at the time of sampling and was chosen as such 2 2 sample collection and water sample

spectrophotometrically after extraction in 90 hot ethanol iso 1992 phytoplankton samples were preserved with lugol s iodine solution for storage and were stored in the dark at room temperature until analysis algal objects were counted from observations of samples sedimented in a sedgwick rafter chamber and reported as counts wang and wang 1982 the phytoplankton species were identified according to zhou and chen 2011 fcm spectral analysis of single cells was performed using a facscalibur becton dickinson california usa with two lasers argon solid state and red diode excitation at 488 and 635

nutrient limitation bioassay experiments nlb experiments were carried out immediately after sample collection and followed the method of paerl et al 2011 also see haraughty and burks 1996 whalen and benson 2007 and xu et al 2013 as examples for an expanded discussion of this type of experiment and its application please see the supplementary material sm for each nlb treatment triplicate water subsamples from each respective station were taken from the 40 l samples described in section 2 2 and placed into 1 l transparent chemically inert cubitainers that were trace metal clean as described in xu et al 2013 nutrient was then added to cubitainers by spiking with concentrated solution to achieve the final concentrations shown in table 1 for each treatment the treatments were control no nutrient additions n p combined n and p np single mns fe cu co b or mo and mn np fe np cu np co np b np or mo np each treatment was sampled twice once at 2 days once 4 days for analysis section 2 2 concentrations of n p np and fe were based on those used in previous work concentrations for other mns were initially targeted at four times projected ambient based on literature on taihu or according to other information in literature bayer et al 2008 procházková et al 2014 xu et al 2013 the chemical form see table 1 of treatments was designed to maximize bioavailability after nutrient additions the cubitainers were incubated in situ in taihu near the surface for four days by placing them in a frame at taihu laboratory for lake ecosystem research this nlb approach was developed to provide a rapid assessment of nutrient limitation characteristics paerl and bowles 1987 piehler et al 2009 xu et al 2010 and follows the preceding taihu work on fe limitation described in xu et al 2013 the approach functionally represents small mesocosm experiments that link the controlled nature of lab experiments with field experiments to capture ambient environmental conditions e g diel cycles temperature conditions as an exploratory study we chose this method to examine short term growth responses of algae as the issue of long term phytoplankton succession patterns is undoubtedly more complex 2 4 data analyses one way anova followed by tukey s honest significant difference hsd post hoc test was used to test for differences in chl a among treatments the r programming language and environment for statistical computing was used to perform calculations and the level of significance used was p 0 05 for all tests bretz et al 2011 additional tests for correlation were performed in microsoft excel pearson s r and spearman s nonparametric ρ to analyse fcm data we used flowmerge finak and gottardo 2011 which is part of the bioconductor software project for the analysis of fcm data huber et al 2015 flowmerge is an extension of the bioconductor flowclust algorithm finak et al 2009 flowclust is based on t mixture models with box cox transformation and when the number of clusters is not known a priori the bayesian information criterion bic is used to determine the most appropriate number of clusters inherent in the multi dimensional structure of fcm data lo et al 2008 2009 while this approach is used and works well in many applications it has been noted that the bic may overestimate cluster number because the number of mixture components needed to model data may be greater than justified by inherent difference in a sample baudry et al 2010 finak et al 2009 this issue has been addressed by application of the entropy based integrated completed likelihood criterion icl the icl has been shown to provide a better estimate of the number of clusters however is not a good model for the underlying data distribution baudry et al 2010 by combining the two approaches data is first clustered using the t mixture model with box cox transformation and subsequently the icl guides remerging mis split clusters arriving at a solution that has the suitable fitting properties and a number of clusters that is most likely to represent the number of different types of cells populations present in a sample finak et al 2009 3 results and discussion 3 1 initial conditions and water quality results from water quality analysis shown in table 2 confirm that the three different stations had different initial conditions turbidity nutrients tn tdn nh4 n tp tdp srp doc and chl a are highest for station 3 intermediate for station 13 and lowest for station 28 some mn concentrations follow this trend tdfe are relatively high and within the range that a previous study found for station 3 10 106 μg l but are considerably higher than that study found in the eastern part of the lake below detection to 3 μg l xu et al 2013 other mn values are reasonably low or below detection as may occur with trace quantities the nutrients tn and tp are both dominated by organic forms the majority of which is particulate for n and presumably p as well though there is a small diminution in the percentage of organic forms from station 3 to station 28 doc follows that pattern and since the predominant drainage pattern and hab pattern is from west to east these results are as expected most other nutrient forms follow this pattern however within analytical uncertainty no3 n is low and essentially static the tn tp ratios are similar for stations 3 and 13 and higher for station 28 and tdn tdp ratios are both a factor of 2 less than the tdn tdp ratio for station 28 there have been reports detailing the ability of cyanobacteria to flourish at low tn tp ratios schindler 1977 smith 1983 the high ph of taihu is notable and perhaps the best indicator of the degree of its anthropogenic perturbation the high ph has been attributed to inorganic carbon scavenging of phytoplankton as a result of habs part of a vicious cycle conveying competitive advantage on bloom forming species wang et al 2017 this ph may substantively reduce the bioavailability of mns due to the formation of bis hydroxy and or carbonato complexes at high ph that is expected theoretically and has been demonstrated experimentally kim et al 1999 o shea and mancy 1978 consistent with prior recent reports we found that the phytoplankton in taihu were variable across the lake dominated by cyanophyta blue green algae cyanobacteria bacilliarophyta diatoms chlorophyta green algae cryptophyta and euglenophyta chen et al 2003b xu et al 2013 fig 2 shows pie charts with the relative percentages of each phylum and the total counts for each station station 3 and station 13 were dominated by cyanophyta 90 of total counts however for station 3 82 of all cyanophytes chroococcus microcystis nostoc and oscillaria spp were microcystis by count whereas for station 13 90 of all cyanophytes were nostoc spp by count microcystis and nostoc are non nitrogen fixing and nitrogen fixing genera respectively which may affect phytoplankton growth differently between these two stations station 28 was dominated by bacilliarophyta the total counts for station 13 are approximately three times that of station 3 whereas the inverse is true for chl a between the two stations the results in table 2 and fig 2 are consistent with the frequent summer trend in taihu wherein nutrient enrichment followed by an hab begins in the western side of the lake and spreads to the east over the course or the summer per literature cited in section 2 1 3 2 nutrient limitation bioassays chl a results fig 3 shows the results from analysis of nlbs for chl a which we use as an index of photosynthetic biomass billington 1991 desortová 1981 flemer 1969 hallegraeff 1977 to show relative changes n p np fe cu co b and mo treatments are normalized to the control panels a d and g and all mn np treatments are

modest and less variable for station 3 average 25 increase with relative standard deviations rsds ranging from 10 to 15 followed by station 13 40 increase and rsds ranging from 30 to 35 and station 28 average increase of chl a by 220 with rsds exceeding 100 a one way anova tukey s hsd post hoc test was performed showing some significant p 0 05 pair wise differences treatment compared to control or np indicated by asterisks in fig 3 for station 3 few differences are seen and only at day 2 for p n np b and fe np both b and fe have previously been reported to increase microcystis growth gerloff 1968 srivastava et al 2016 while np exhibited the highest chl a relative to the control by day 2 by day 4 it appears that np has accelerated the onset of senescence a term representing a range of processes mostly in reference to declining degrading chl a associated with late stationary lysis phases resulting from environmental stresses such as nutrient limitation louda et al 1998 station 3 had the highest nutrients and initial concentrations of chl a and on an absolute basis there is a trend of chl a diminution over 4 days with an inverse correlation r 2 0 80 between δchl a0 2d and δchl a2 4d this observation fits with the idea that for a late stationary assemblage less nutritive treatments e g the control in fig 3c result in progressive senescence or decline decreasing growth curve slope with a diminishing rate of change whereas more nutritive treatments cause partial reinvigoration or at least retard the onset of senescence flat to increasing growth curve slope as for np mn np treatments in fig 3c with subsequent senescence after nutrient exhaustion in terms of growth curve behaviour larger nutrient concentrations result in larger changes in curvature rate of change in comparison to lower concentrations gough et al 2015 lee et al 2000 pinna et al 2015 more discussion of growth curve slopes is provided in the sm along with an illustrative schematic station 3 was highly impacted by an hab during the time of this study the results indicate that np mn np and to a lesser extent b have the most effect in supporting the persistence of the hab in actual lake conditions microcystis can vertically migrate throughout the shallow water column optimizing its ability to access favorable conditions to proliferate which in turn increases its lateral extent smaller differences we see in mesocosm nlbs might be larger in an open lake for the data in fig 3c also see fig 3f and i pearson s r and spearman s ρ are given in the figure caption for a further discussion of fig 3 results and results from additional statistical tests see the sm the station 13 trend for n and p is similar overall to that of station 3 in that the order of effect relative to the control is np n p fig 3 albeit the pattern persists to day 4 treatments of mn only statistically exceed control np treatment for cu and fe np day 2 and cu np day 4 while for most mn mn np relative chl a decreases from day 2 to day 4 the behaviour of cu cu np is strikingly different with chl a concentrations increasing for cu by 61 and cu np by 11 from day 2 to day 4 relative to the control and np respectively for the scatter plot showing δchl a0 2d versus δchl a2 4d for station 13 fig 3f both visually and in terms of r 2 there appears to be two groups with an inverse linear relationship the first group is the no growth group though r 2 0 86 it may be more appropriate to view this group as tightly clustered the second group is all of the remaining treatments for this group the np mn np treatments show growth during over first two days positive growth curve slope i e a negative δchl a0 2d value followed by diminution as nutrients have become exhausted whereas cu and p show diminution in chl a over the first two days with a net increase thereafter we posit that as for station 3 the standing stock for station 13 is at or nearing decline and while the np treatments provoke a reasonably rapid response p and cu may undergo lag i e the changes are suggestive of adjustment and or decline of the standing stock followed by growth for station 28 changes for n and p are not significantly different from the control however np together has chl a that is almost 10 times that of the control days 2 and 4 interestingly by day 2 for all mn np treatments the response is less than that of np alone with cu np being a pronounced factor of 4 9 lower the lower response for single mn is not generalisable though the response for cu alone is also much lower 2 7 times less than the control by day 4 all of the control normalized single mn treatments have increased compared to their values on day 2 and mn np treatments are all larger than np significantly so for co and cu the treatment cu np has the most pronounced differential effect and is 4 times greater than for np with a 22 fold increase from day 2 to day 4 the scatter plot for station 28 fig 3i lends the appearance of different behaviours 1 c n p fe co b and mo 2 cu np fe np co np b np and mo np and 3 cu np in a class of its own changes for the first group are small and consist of a near constant δchl a0 2d followed by small and variable increases in δchl a2 4d the second group follows the inverse relationship discussed previously for stations 3 and 13 wherein those greatest increases in δchl a0 2d positive growth curve slope are followed by smaller δchl a2 4d in the case of station 28 possibly indicating onset of stationary phase rather than senescence and vice versa overall we observe trends in fig 3c f and i that are rationalizable in terms of algal growth curves see sm and appear to result in different groupings based on the initial condition of standing stocks and the relative nutrient value of different treatments the similarity between pearson s r and spearman s ρ are in most cases in good agreement except when including cu np for station 28 for station 28 filled markers in fig 3i spearman s ρ indicates a strong monotonic if not linear relationship when including cu np with respect to n p and np the results herein present a unified picture for the stations sampled spanning the width of taihu wherein np are co limiting nutrients for habs in agreement with previous studies dzialowski et al 2005 paerl et al 2015 xu et al 2013 yang et al 2017 while there is an increasing awareness that mns and the bioavailability of trace metals play important roles in the carbon and nitrogen metabolism of algae baptista and vasconcelos 2006 berman frank et al 2001 juneja et al 2013 romero et al 2013 the state of knowledge is as yet immature and our primary purpose for this work was to ascertain whether mns would exhibit effects in a highly disturbed and frequently hypereutrophic system as taihu the statistically significant results in fig 3 indicate that mns may serve both as primary and as co limiting nutrients in some cases results for cu cu np stations 13 and 28 are most marked and fe np shows effects for two stations 3 and 13 for station 28 cu cu np appeared to show an inhibitory effect at day 2 whereas by day 4 the maximum increase observed during this study was for cu np it has long been known that at high enough concentrations cu is an algal biocide and cu2 has even been suggested for use in environmental management of habs at concentrations ranging from 90 to 500 μg l källqvist and meadows 1978 wu et al 2017 likewise the importance of cu as a mn for algae has long been recognised manahan and smith 1973 because mn such as cu are required in very small amounts in the whole algae life cycle there is frequently only a very small difference between a nutritional growth promoting effect and cell toxicity procházková et al 2014 the effect of cu np in station 28 is unique to our knowledge in the literature there is some possibility that the cu effect relates to fe there has been a growing amount of research into bacterial and algal production of copper binding ligands called chalkophores and copper binding siderophores these ligands have demonstrated importance in controlling the bioavailability of cu and may aid organisms to regulate cu uptake and navigate a narrow divide between nutrition and toxicity johnstone and nolan 2015 regarding a linked effect with fe as early as 1980 mcknight and morel 1980 published findings wherein fe limitation resulted in strong secretion of chalkophores by two anabaena species they speculated that cu complexes formed with such ligands were likely non toxic and might convey an advantage to cyanophyte populations subsequently genetic regulatory links between cu and fe homeostasis in cyanophytes have been discovered for example based on genetic studies employing site directed mutagenesis nicolaisen et al 2010 have developed a model wherein schizokinen a siderophore secreted by anabaena spp is produced and exported under low fe or high cu conditions when the concentrations of both fe and cu are low schizokinen complexes with fe increasing fe bioavailability to the organism at high cu low fe concentrations schizokinen complexes cu in a manner protective to the organism and another fe transporter is activated these findings are analogous to findings for p aeruginosa wherein exposure to toxic cu concentrations resulted in the differential production of siderophores such that a more cu protective effect bioavailability reduction is favoured braud et al 2010 in this study the ambient tdfe for station 28 averages half that of the other stations table 2 since the high chl a response of cu np appears previously undocumented some phytoplankton reportedly have a relatively high cellular fe requirement brand 1991 and the low solubility of environmentally prevalent fe3 reduces fe bioavailability we cannot rule out that cu treatment induced increased fe bioavailability followed by growth 3 3 effects of micronutrient supply on changes in algal assemblages our purpose in using in situ algae was to investigate if any changes in algal assemblages might be observed and if there might be clues as to mn s mediating conditions favouring microcystis over other algae figs 4 6 showing the changing proportions of algae in response to mn treatments disaggregated counts for all species including species with very low frequency are given in the sm while count data give a sense of changes some species quantified are colonial and some are not counting methods address this arguably not very successfully rott et al 2007 thus here we take a semi quantitative rather than statistical approach for station 3 changes in total counts and algal assemblages are relatively small cyanophytes remain dominant with microcystis spp averaging 88 of the total cyanophyte counts fig 4 by day 4 the total counts for both cyanophyta and chlorophyta were larger for the single mn treatments in comparison to the corresponding mn nps consistent with the effects discussed for chl a with respect to np while cyanophyta predominated initially for station 13 followed by bacillariophyta then chlorophtya the dominant genus was nostoc spp and changes to the algal populations of station 13 in response to mn treatment present a more complex picture than that of station 3 fig 5 the stairstep pattern of cyanophyta bacillariophyta chlorophtya in the initial water persisted in the control over 4 days however the percentage of cyanophytes in the control shifted from 81 nostoc spp 7 microcystis spp initially to 19 nostoc 39 microcystis by day 2 and 12 nostoc 37 microcystis by day 4 this transition from nostoc to microcystis occurred in all treatments as well with varying percentages the stairstep distribution was observed for the all non np treatments in day 2 for np treatments by day 2 there was a consistent increase of chlorophtya relative to bacillariophyta with abundance of chlorophtyes being similar or exceeding that of bacillariophytes a shift which continued to day 4 when all np mn np treatments save cu np were dominated by cyanophytes however chlorophytes had become more abundant than bacillariophytes the change for cu np was dramatic with chlorophyta becoming 89 a strikingly apparent visual change under the microscope also by day 4 the most abundant form of cyanophyte was chroococcus spp for cu np and scenedesmus spp abundance was 78 over four times that of any other treatment for stations 3 and 13 chroococcus abundance only reached double digits for cu station 3 and 13 and cu np in station 13 notable changes in phytoplankton assemblages in single mn treatments were observed for cu and co in the case of cu by day 4 the pattern mimicked that of cu np wherein chlorophytes were dominant followed by cyanophytes most common form chroococcus then bacillariophytes for co by day 4 bacillariophyta became the most abundant type outnumbering cyanophyta for station 28 the dominant algae in the water column initially were bacilliarophytes melosira spp 77 see sm with another 11 and 4 respectively of cyanophytes and chlorophytes fig 6 for most treatments the pattern of abundance was bacillariophyta melosira followed by cyanophyta or chlorophyta in some cases control n np fe np cu cu np co np b np mo np chlorophyta were more prevalent than cyanophyta cyanophytes were mostly microcystis except for cu cu np the only treatments that had double digit abundance of chroococcus 13 the day 2 total counts for both cu and cu np were lower than for any other treatment and cu np was the only treatment wherein chlorophytes dominated followed by bacillariophyta then cyanophyta for the original station 28 water the small amount of chlorophytes present was equally distributed between chlorella and pediastrum spp by day 2 the proportion was the same for cu and cu np had twice the amount of the latter as the former by day 4 cu np chlorophyta was dominated by scenedesmus spp 24 the only treatment to have more than 4 the pattern of abundance by phylum was not greatly changed by day 4 for some treatments control n p all of the single mn treatments except for cu for np fe np and cu np cyanophytes had become the dominant species also having a high abundance in cu and for np and cu np bacillariophyta became a minor component the treatments np fe np cu and cu np at day 4 were the only ones to have chroococcus spp 30 or greater 30 29 37 56 respectively see sm the treatments co np b np and mo np all showed a similar pattern at 4 days bacillariophyta dominant followed by cyanophyta then chlorophyta with relatively elevated total counts these treatments were also distinguished by relatively high amounts of synedra spp 69 75 and 84 respectively averaging 2 5 times the highest of all other treatments see sm results from count data are in general accord with chl a data in that station 3 is relatively static and for stations 13 and 28 more and varied changes occur reflecting potentially complicated succession patterns that depend on the relative distribution of the different species at the start of our experiments and how each respond to treatment chlorophyta or bacillariophyta are able in some cases to expand at the expense of cyanophyta for cu cu np and co in station 13 the most notable change occurring for stations 13 and 28 is for cu treatment singly or with np for both stations much higher amounts of pediastrum and or scenedesmus species thought to be relatively more tolerant and or needing cu bilgrami and kumar 1997 merchant 1998 appear by day 4 for cu np and to a lesser extent cu for station 13 microcystis diminishes from day 2 to day 4 for cu cu np whereas the opposite occurs for station 28 the largest increases for microcystis in station 28 occur for np fe np cu and cu np in view of the relative sensitivity of microcystis to cu horne and goldman 1974 zeng et al 2010 the potential role of cu and fe affecting the bioavailability of each other as discussed for chl a in section 3 2 the lower amount of fe in the ambient water of station 28 and the contrasting effect of cu cu np on microcystis in stations 13 versus 28 this again raises the question of to what extent changes seen for cu relate to fe the present results also underscore the desirability of trying to understand how mns affect succession patterns 3 4 flow cytometry analysis to determine changing characteristics of algal populations fcm is a promising tool to study changes in size abundance and community composition we used fcm in two ways 1 for univariate analysis performing estimation of biovolumes and analysis of the fl3 chl a channel in comparison to bulk chl a analysis and 2 for data driven multivariate analysis we review the major findings of multivariate analysis here as we believe it to the most important contribution to the literature the results of univariate analysis along with detailed comments on multivariate analysis are included in the sm for brevity clustering algorithms are fundamental in the quest to automate analysis of fcm data johnsson et al 2016 the data driven approach that we use here is more robust to handling difficult clustering issues in fcm to provide a final number of clusters most likely representing the number of different types of cells or populations that are separable distinct in a sample finak and gottardo 2011 we tried a number of algorithms busam et al 2007 han et al 2011 lo et al 2008 zare et al 2010 however flowmerge was superior in consistent reproducibility across treatments stations and sampling periods to perform clustering we took fcm data files and visually inspected bivariate plots confirming a large number of changes as a function of time and treatment next we performed clustering on each data file clusters are characterised in terms of cluster centers which is the average value of each of the fcm channels for a given cluster fsc ssc fl1 caroteniod fl2 pe fl3 chl a fl4 apc per section 2 2 for the triplicate samples the average proportion of each cluster and value of each fcm channel was plotted as a function of time three main types of cluster cluster 1 c1 cluster 2 c2 and cluster 3 c3 occur reproducibly c1 and c2 were detected in most samples c1 is characterised by relative to the other clusters a high ssc to fsc ratio and very low fl values across all channels c2 has relatively a high fsc to ssc ratio and moderate fl across all channels c3 is a cluster that appears in many treatments at days 2 and 4 and is characterised by having smaller fsc than c2 smaller ssc than c1 and fl generally higher than c1 but lower than c2 often the flowmerge algorithm finak and gottardo 2011 that we used identified many more clusters than these three however as some of these do not appear with high frequency represent very small proportions of the sample and often do not cluster repeatably across replicate samples we do not discuss them further fig 7 shows some representative fcm contour plots how these compare to cluster plots the total number of bivariate plots was 3825 see sm for additional selected examples and some examples of how clusters change as a function of time see sm for the full 63 plots of this data examination of the bivariate contour plots that we constructed in comparison to clustering data suggests that for c1 and especially c2 there might be more structure in some results than are differentiable by data driven clustering these buried clusters likely represent different algal species phyla dennis et al 2011 franklin et al 2010 peniuk et al 2016 regarding c1 fcm reports of features with very low fluorescence for algal samples describe these features in two ways near zero fluorescence that is characteristic of bacterial heterotrophs and very low fluorescence signals from algal sources such as debris or compromised cells that have variously been described as shrunken cells with high granularity ssc cells that have lost membrane integrity or cells that have been verified to be dead huang et al 2015 lopes da silva et al 2018 wang et al 2016 for those samples dominated by c1 and c2 e g our initial water samples c2 is everything else i e predominately cells in the exponential or stationary phase of growth we observe that c3 is not present in stations 3 13 or 28 initially and is only present in some day 2 and day 4 samples for which active growth is likely occurring ssc may increase disproportionately to fsc for dead or dying cells however for growing cells fsc and ssc are expected to increase together larger objects scatter more than smaller in the forward and side directions it is also possible that internal cell structure changes cause variations in ssc signal overall c3 s modest fsc ssc and fl signatures imply small but living cells the small fsc denoting small er relative size small ssc resulting from smaller side scatter of a small object and small fl resulting from a smaller volume of pigment contained in small cells we posit that c3 is newly divided or induction early exponential phase cells clustering results for station 3 shows the least variability for greater detail on clustering results see sm changes to c1 are modest for c2 by day 4 n np and np mn treatments see overall a slight decrease over this time the biggest loss is 12 for np corresponding to the appearance of c3 for these treatments the highest proportion of c3 is np np had notably low bulk chl a by day 4 the very low bulk chl a in day 4 for np may be related to this treatment s having the highest loss of c2 for np the most fluorescent cluster and greatest gain of c3 the cu np clustering is the only one to show a consistent rise in fsc and all fl channels between day 2 and day 4 for station 13 changes to c1 are similar as for station 3 and losses in c2 translate to gains in c3 by day 4 the proportion of c2 in cu and cu np treatments has decreased by 30 and 32 respectively which are the only treatments to have proportions of c2 less than the control only 20 of the cu treatment population is in c2 by day 2 less than half the initial proportion by day 4 c3 has appeared for all np mn np clusters and cu the proportion of all c3 clusters except cu and cu np is 5 whereas for cu and cu np it is 10 and 28 respectively overall the observations appear consistent with bulk chl a results though the relationship is complex see sm for further comments on fl3 versus chl a and how chl a relates to clustering results for station 28 the proportion of c1 is highest initially 73 and is diminishing much more strongly in comparison to stations 3 and 13 by day 4 c1 had disappeared for the treatments co co np b b np and mo np for all other treatments save n and p the c1 proportion diminished to 10 with n having the highest proportion of c1 at 16 the changes in proportion for c2 are most extreme of the three stations and are mirrored by c3 over the first two days of treatment proportions of c2 decrease from 23 to 4 6 for cu and cu np remain in the region of starting conditions for p and for all other treatments a marked increase in the proportion of c2 by an integer factor of 2 3 is observed by day 4 c3 appears in all treatments however the proportions of c3 for cu and cu np 60 70 are twice that of the remaining treatment c3s 11 29 a number of other changes are seen see sm one notable one is that for c3 cu np fsc increases by a factor of approximately 2 5 from day 2 to day 4 and ssc increases by a factor of 4 both of which are by far the largest relative increases for these clustering results are consistent with other results however provide a different perspective for example np in station 3 cu cu np in stations 13 and 28 and co np b np and mo np in station 28 show distinct differences in chl a and or counts that are also apparent in clustering notably cu np behaviour was different in clustering across all stations and the behaviour particularly for station 28 suggests that this treatment is causing a rapid diminution in standing stocks c2 with rapid new growth c3 thereafter we have posited that the effect of cu might relate to fe bioavailability however the clustering result suggests another possibility cu sensitive populations are inhibited while less cu sensitive populations obtain competitive advantage and grow rapidly in the presence of np this would be consistent with changes in assemblages seen from count data for station 13 cu np did not favour microcystis however for station 28 it did we have found only one report detailing longer term studies on the effect of cu addition zhao et al 2009 and this report found that cu does discourage cyanobacteria for a limited time after which cyanobacterial hab conditions return the question of how cu mediates shifts in assemblages and whether this relates to fe is an interesting topic for further study as our use of a data driven approach to fcm analysis of phytoplankton is new we had no expectations about what we might find we did not find linkages pointing to contributions of species phyta this requires authentic samples posing issues in terms of whether algal cultures are truly axenic whether culture collection strains are representative of in situ counterparts and whether the effect of distortions imposed by environmental conditions are mimicked in authentic samples we did find that the results from clustering of fcm data are in many ways in accord with other findings for initial water quality chl a changes and changes in phytoplankton assemblage station 3 represents one endpoint in terms of initial water quality and shows the smallest overall changes in chl a and phytoplankton assemblages station 28 is in most ways the diametric opposite with lower initial concentrations of most constituents analysed and having chl a and phytoplankton assemblages that changed the most and quite variably in response to treatment station 13 is intermediate to stations 3 and 13 based on our results it would be reasonable to characterize response to treatment as what is mathematically referred to as an initial value problem initial water quality parameters and phytoplankton assemblages determine the trajectory of change and a change in the status quo can potentially result in dramatic outcomes e g cu np in station 28 given the high efficiency with which data driven fcm can be performed we will pursue further studies in future to develop and better understand the utility of this approach 4 conclusions the results presented here show that mn treatment effects on algae varied spatially and among algal groups in taihu with key points being as follows there is a growing body of molecular biological data vida supra that documents homeostatic links between mns herein we discuss fe and cu and possible mechanisms of molecular control of the bioavailability of mns simultaneously there is an emerging body of literature 1 documenting the importance of fe in controlling algal phytoplankton growth and 2 propounding the use of cu as an algal biocide given the strong effects for cu that we report here are mutually consistent through the chl a count and fcm data and given that we cannot rule out a role for fe in causing these effects more research into mns and how they interact with n p and other mns should be pursued to explore new interventions for effective management of habs notably the very nature of the micro in micronutrient may hold promise as being more amenable to intervention for instance to help one species outcompete another over regional scales in view of the stimulatory effect that cu exhibited inclusive of the cyanobacteria microcystis spp management of habs with cu as an algal biocide may be inadvisable the data in our study are not sufficiently exhaustive to demonstrate that copper sulfate treatments and the resulting copper concentrations in treated water have the potential to promote microcystis growth however they do lend basis for invoking the best practice precautionary principle in environmental management a better understanding of the role of cu in affecting algal phytoplankton is needed before implementing its widespread use in an environment where it might stimulate growth rather than retard it results from data driven analysis of fcm are in accord with the chl a and counting data and this approach holds promise for development of more

19089,acid mine drainage amd has been recognized as a major challenge to the global mining industry due to its environmental consequences lime neutralization has been a traditional treatment for amd but the abundance of iron and sulfate in amd usually renders it ineffective by forming iron hydroxide and gypsum precipitate coating on the surface of lime in light of ubiquitous biological mineralization phenomena present at amd sites a rapid chemical mineralization was developed to reduce iron and sulfate and recovery of iron from amd prior to lime neutralization through a cyclic reduction oxidation process by the addition of iron powder and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 over 90 fe3 and 40 so4 2 could be removed beforehand by forming schwertmannite the pretreated amd drastically reduced both the required lime slurry in the subsequent lime neutralization process and the amount of neutralized sludge the resultant schwertmannite had a specific surface area of 3 9 m2 g and a formula of fe8o8 oh 4 5 so4 1 75 this technique could reduce lime consumption increase metal level in neutralized sludge and harvest environmentally friendly materials these results demonstrate that the integrated chemical mineralization and lime neutralization treatment is expected to be widely used in practical application graphical abstract image 1 keywords acid mine drainage chemical mineralization schwertmannite lime neutralization 1 introduction acid mine drainage amd has caused serious environmental pollution all over the world especially where coal and gold mining activities are common akcil and koldas 2006 kefeni et al 2017 the main source of amd is the biotic oxidation of sulfide minerals e g pyrite pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite during and following mining operations blodau 2006 singer and stumm 1970 among which pyrite ore is the main material responsible for the generation of amd due to its ease of oxidation when exposed to oxygen water and microorganisms chen et al 2014 pierre louis et al 2015 after various oxidation reactions under different conditions the pyrite can be completely oxidized to generate excess amounts of h fe2 and so4 2 evangelou and zhang 1995 therefore amd poses severe threats to soil water resources and aquatic communities due to its low ph and high concentrations of potentially toxic dissolved metals iron aluminum manganese and other heavy metals metalloids in which arsenic is generally of the greatest concern and sulphate kefeni et al 2017 active chemical treatment is the most widely used technique for amd remediation which combines aeration with alkaline lime or limestone addition to promote the chemical oxidation of fe2 to fe3 and removes ions through the formation of ferric hydroxide and calcium sulfate precipitates hedin et al 1994 iii and trahan 1999 johnson and hallberg 2005 however two major shortcomings limit this technique s wide application in practical treatment processes santomartino and webb 2007 1 it usually generates voluminous sludge that takes up more disposal space 2 the abundant metal ions especially that of iron existing in amd are hard to be recycled the abundant iron and sulphate that exists in amd are the main cause of large quantities of sludge because they can deteriorate the lime treatment system and reduce neutralization efficacy by forming precipitate coating on lime grains namely iron and sulfate are urgently needed to be eliminated from amd beforehand in order to alleviate the treatment burden of lime neutralization inspired by the ubiquitous biomineralization phenomena found at amd sites bioreactor systems have seen extensive research to selectively recover metal from amd in recent years two microorganism phyla acidophilic sulfate reducing bacteria srb hedrich and johnson 2014 ňancucheo et al 2012 and acidophilic iron oxidation autotroph hedrich and johnson 2012 were used to selectively precipitate metal ions via the formation of metal sulfides or iron hydroxysulfates respectively compared with srb the latter is more suitable for practical application owing to the following three aspects 1 no exogenous carbon source is required because the chemolithoautotroph such as acidthiobacillus ferrooxidans a ferrooxidans can acquire energy from autotrophic metabolic pathways 2 no anaerobic environment is required and 3 the resultant iron hydroxysulfates have direct utilization potentials in the field of environment science among these iron hydroxysulfates schwertmannite of a weakly crystalline form with a variable chemical formula of fe8o8 oh 8 2x so4 x where x ranges from 1 to 1 75 bao et al 2018 vithana et al 2015 xiong et al 2008 has been considered to have the potential as one of the most environmentally friendly materials due to its excellent adsorption capacity for dissolved metal and metalloid elements carlson et al 2002 richmond et al 2004 fernandez rojo et al 2017 indeed biomineralization can decrease iron and sulfate concentrations in amd and thus save the cost associated with chemicals dosed in the subsequent lime neutralization however there are still some disadvantages limiting its practical application in full scale the ambient condition for biomineralization is relatively rigorous causing the properties of the solution in question including ph value temperature dissolved oxygen content and ion species among others to play crucial roles in the success of the process regenspurg et al 2004 vithana et al 2015 in addition the relatively high costs involved in the construction and operation of such biological treatment systems have a direct impact on their further scale up fortunately chemical mineralization that mimics biological ones through the utilization of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 has been reported as a simple and rapid method to fabricate schwertmannite from feso4 solution duan et al 2016 liu et al 2015a regenspurg et al 2004 compared with the biosynthetic pathway the preparation conditions and chemical properties of the resultant schwertmannite produced in this chemical synthesis route are much easier to control however to our knowledge the chemical fabrication of schwertmannite has only been conducted with feso4 reagent of analytical grade purity as the iron and sulfate source in laboratory and has not proceeded into the application of practical amd treatment yet let alone the efficiency and degree of mineralization in practical treatment which warrants a detailed study here this study proposes a novel treatment technique that integrates chemical mineralization and lime neutralization to dispose practical amd the objectives were 1 to investigate the feasibility and efficiency of iron and sulfate recovery 2 to identify the physicochemical properties of the resultant schwertmannite and 3 to evaluate the application potential of this novel technique 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification iron powder fe0 copper powder cu0 h2o2 30 w v hcl hno3 hclo4 cao 1 10 phenanthroline hydroxylamine hydrochloride and acetic acid sodium were all purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china amd was collected from mine effluent of the abandoned dexing copper mine located in jiangxi china 29 01 00 n 117 44 0 e which was once the largest open pit copper mine in asia the sample was kept in a refrigerator at 4 c prior to chemical experiments and analyses the main ion components and ph values of such raw amd samples are presented in table 1 2 2 experimental section 2 2 1 chemical mineralization chemical mineralization was conducted in 500 ml shaking flasks containing 200 ml amd and operated in a cyclic regime by sequencing through two steps 1 reduction and filtration 2 oxidation and separation in the first step fe0 or cu0 was added whose dosages were half of the fe3 that existed in the 200 ml amd to be treated the reduction process was initiated by shaking these flasks at 180 rpm on a rotary shaker at 28 c liquid samples of 2 ml were taken 2 h later and subjected to fe2 and residual fe3 analysis after passing through a 0 45 μm filter membrane once the fe2 concentration did not increase any further residual fe0 or cu0 was removed from the liquid by either magnetism or filtration and step two was introduced by the addition of h2o2 the dosage of h2o2 was calculated according to the fe2 concentration that was determined from the first step at a molar ratio 0 8 of h2o2 fe2 the molar ratio of h2o2 fe2 chosen here was based on the following two considerations 1 the fe2 oxidation reaction 2fe2 h2o2 2h 2fe3 2h2o required a molar ratio of at least 0 5 2 certain amounts of soluble organic matter may exist in amd and cause an over consumption of h2o2 the oxidation process was conducted under the same circumstances as the reduction process except the incubation time was prolonged to 24 h to achieve a thorough reaction at the end of this step membrane separation was applied to collect the precipitate and the resultant supernatant was poured back to the flask it is worthy to mention that a certain amount of deionized water was added to the supernatant to compensate for the water loss during the two step operation because constant volume was the basis of accurate stoichiometric calculation when the liquid volume was brought back to 200 ml by the weight method a second reduction oxidation round was started this cyclic reduction oxidation process is schematically illustrated in fig 1 a 2 2 2 iron relevant calculations in each reduction process the fe3 reduction ratio was calculated based on equation 1 1 fe 3 reduction c red fe 3 c red res fe 3 c red fe 3 100 where c red fe 3 and c red res fe 3 are the initial and residual supernatant fe3 concentration mm in the corresponding reduction process respectively a total iron removal ratio relative to raw amd after each oxidation process was calculated based on equation 2 2 total fe removal c 0 fe t c cm res fe t c 0 fe t 100 where c 0 fe t is the initial iron concentration mm of raw amd and c cm res fe t is the residual supernatant fe3 concentration mm determined at the end of each oxidation process the cumulative precipitated iron concentration mm after each chemical mineralization cycle was calculated according to equation 3 3 cumulative iron precipitate mm 0 n c cm 0 fe t c red fe 0 2 c cm res fe t where c cm 0 fe t and c red fe 0 2 are the concentrations of initial supernatant fe3 and fe2 introduced by fe0 determined in each reduction process respectively while n represents the number of cycles of chemical mineralization 2 2 3 lime neutralization to investigate the metal ion removal capability by traditional lime neutralization 5 w v cao slurry was added dropwise to 50 ml of raw amd to get a ph gradient ranging from 3 to 12 at each indicated ph value 2 ml of liquid sample was withdrawn and subjected to a residual metal ion assay accordingly during this process the endpoint of lime neutralization was determined as a specific ph value at which over 90 of the metal ions were precipitated subsequently ph values of 50 ml amd samples either untreated or pretreated by fe0 mediated chemical mineralization were adjusted to the neutralization endpoint by the addition of cao slurry after which the residual metal ion concentration and resultant neutralized sludge amount were determined and subjected to comparison 2 3 analytical methods solution ph was measured with a phs 3c model digital ph meter mettler toledo switzerland water samples were prepared by filtering through 0 45 μm filters metal ions including fe3 al3 ca2 mg2 cu2 zn2 and mn2 were assayed by a shimadzu icps 7500 inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer icp aes shimadzu japan while so4 2 concentrations were determined by a dionex ic 1100 ion chromatography system thermo fisher usa whenever it was necessary to distinguish between fe3 and fe2 fe2 concentration was determined before and after the sample was reduced by excess ascorbic acid apha 1981 harvey et al 1955 using the ferrozine colorimetric assay with a t 6 spectrophotometer philes china fe3 concentration was then calculated based on the difference between such two measurements the precipitates collected at the end of each chemical mineralization cycle with fe0 as reductant were washed twice with deionized water and then fully dried in a drying oven at 60 c crystal structures were measured by a rotaflex d max x ray powder diffraction xrd rigaku japan with a cu kα radiation source 50 kv 150 ma the morphology was observed by an s 3400n scanning electron microscope sem hitachi japan equipped with a philips xl 30e instrument operated at a 20 kv accelerating voltage the elemental composition was examined by energy disperse spectroscopy eds 20 kv mn kα the fe3 and so4 2 contents in iron precipitate was determined by icp aes and ion chromatography after acid dissolution with hclo4 the nitrogen sorption isotherms of the precipitates were collected at 77 k using a tri star ii 3020 automatic specific surface and porosity analyzer micromeritics usa after which the brunauer emmett teller bet method was used to calculate their specific surface areas 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality of raw amd amd collected from dexing copper mine jiangxi china had a typical acidity with a ph value of 2 2 table 1 so4 2 was the dominant anion with a concentration of 8011 mg l besides fe3 1235 mg l al3 560 mg l and ca2 240 mg l were shown to be the other main metal species these properties were in accordance with the reported conventional amd results carrero et al 2015 feng et al 2000 fitzpatrick et al 2017 casiot et al 2003 except that fe3 rather than fe2 was the dominant iron species this could be attributed to the occurrence of a long term biotic and abiotic oxidation in the aerobic environment when the samples were exposed to in the abandoned open pit mine when traditional direct neutralization was applied to treat the raw amd by adjusting the ph with cao slurry the presence of metal ions and so4 2 in the materials over consumed cao and increased the amount of neutralized sludge this conclusion was evidenced by the neutralization of 1 l of raw amd to ph 7 5 consuming 3 3 g of cao and resulting in 11 1 g of sludge table 1 however in practice such application may cause a hindrance to treatment facilities therefore direct lime neutralization does not seem to be an effective option for amd remediation 3 2 chemical mineralization mineralization is an important natural process in the conversion of soluble ions to solid chemical materials through which the metal ions in amd can be eliminated for example schwertmannite was formed through fe3 hydrolysis and precipitation with so4 2 when fe2 was oxidized by bacteria in amd sites reaction 4 and 5 bigham et al 1996b jambor and dutrizac 1998 4 fe 2 1 4 o 2 h a f e r r o o x i d a n s fe 3 1 2 h 2 o 5 fe 3 7 4 h 2 o 1 8 so 4 2 1 8 fe 8 o 8 oh 6 so 4 11 4 h it should be noted that the fe3 could not react with so4 2 in the absence of a ferrooxidans which might be due to the lack of reaction energy supplied by the oxidation process of fe2 to fe3 regenspurg et al 2004 that is also why the aforementioned studies directly used feso4 solution as the research object liu et al 2015a these valuable findings indicated that specific to the practical amd treated by this study in which fe3 is the dominant iron species a pre reduction of fe3 to fe2 is a prerequisite that can be realized by the addition of either fe0 reaction 6 or cu0 reaction 7 served as control thereafter a rapid chemical mineralization can be followed by using h2o2 as an alternative oxidant in the absence of a ferrooxidans reaction 8 and 5 6 fe 3 1 2 fe 0 3 2 fe 2 7 fe 3 1 2 cu 0 fe 2 1 2 cu 2 8 fe 2 1 2 h 2 o 2 h fe 3 h 2 o 3 2 1 iron specie conversion during chemical mineralization roughly 80 fe3 was reduced to fe2 by fe0 or cu0 at the end of the first reduction process fig 1b whereas the resultant fe2 concentration after fe0 reduction was much higher than that of cu0 it is clear that the fe0 that took part in the reaction was converted to fe2 as well reaction 6 which increased the concentration of fe2 in the solution accordingly the fe2 generated in this reduction process was then oxidized to fe3 within 24 h after the addition of h2o2 during which period partial fe3 underwent hydrolysis and precipitation reactions accompanied with these oxidative processes was a visible solution color change from light green to reddish brown and the gradual appearance of orange colored precipitates however only about 35 of fe3 was removed through precipitation meaning 65 of fe3 still existed in solution at the end of the first oxidation process fig 1b though this low mineralization ratio has also been reported in previous studies on either biomineralization or chemical mineralization processes liao et al 2009 liu et al 2015a 2015b xu et al 2014 the underlying mechanism is still unclear and warrants a further research 3 2 2 elimination of fe3 and so4 2 by cyclic chemical mineralization as mentioned above after one reduction oxidation process i e chemical mineralization there was still a substantial amount of iron left in the supernatant whose species was converted to fe3 again due to h2o2 oxidation which would not react with so4 2 anymore therefore to achieve more fe3 removal and higher mineral yield fe3 needed to be reduced back to fe2 and then oxidized again namely cyclic chemical mineralization had to be performed to treat amd as shown in fig 2 a in each reduction process of the following chemical mineralization cycles the fe3 reduction ratio still kept a steady range from 70 to 82 by utilizing either fe0 or cu0 as the reductant the increased cycles did improve total fe3 removal ratio over 95 of fe3 in raw amd could be removed after either 8 or 15 cycles mediated by cu0 or fe0 respectively fig 2b although cu0 mediated mineralization could remove the same amount of total fe3 with fewer cycles its resultant cumulative iron precipitates were far less than that mediated by fe0 fig 2c in addition slope k value comparison of the dashed lines in fig 2c clearly demonstrates that the iron precipitate cumulation rate after fe0 reduction was much faster than that by cu0 this was because fe0 was partly oxidized to fe2 during the reduction process reaction 6 which increased the total fe2 concentration at the end of this process fig 1b this portion of extra fe2 can also be oxidized to fe3 by h2o2 which would further hydrolyze and precipitate with so4 2 as iron hydroxysulfates reaction 5 as such fe0 mediated mineralization cycle proceeded the gradual decrease of total fe3 concentration caused a concomitant decline of the fe2 increment especially after ten cycles fig 2d which corresponded to a lower iron precipitate cumulation rate fig 2c even so the total fe fe t removal amount still showed a decreasing trend in each cyclic chemical mineralization thereafter fig 2d as a result both the iron mineral yield and so4 2 removal ratio were about four times larger when fe0 was used as the reductant fig 3 in other words a higher efficiency of total fe3 precipitation corresponds to more iron mineral synthesis the chemical mineralization with fe0 as the reductant significantly increased the amount of cumulative iron precipitates and the efficiency of so4 2 removal conversely cu0 mediated reduction brought high levels of cu2 1864 mg l after eight cycles table 1 which would increase the disposal burden in the following treatment in addition any excess unreacted fe0 could be easily separated by a magnet therefore fe0 was more suitable for fe3 reduction in chemical mineralization after treated with 15 cycles of chemical mineralization fe3 and so4 2 concentrations decreased from 1235 4 and 8011 2 mg l to 170 1 and 5005 7 mg l respectively table 1 solution ph values have been reported as a critical influence factor for the synthesis of iron hydroxysulfates liao et al 2009 liu et al 2015a after each reduction process solution ph values increased to a range of 2 8 3 0 owing to the fact that h was consumed by partial fe0 in the subsequent oxidation process fe3 formed by h2o2 oxidation was hydrolyzed in solution the acid produced in this process reduced the ph value and caused it to stabilize at approximately 2 4 fig 4 thus ferric hydroxysulphate was formed by a competing reaction between ferric hydrolysate and sulphate in the ph range of 2 4 3 0 according to previous reports pure mineral phase is easily formed in this ph range

cyclic chemical mineralization the volume of lime neutralized sludge could be reduced to 30 which was equivalent to a saving of 70 valuable disposal space in addition metal ions stemming from amd were

19089,acid mine drainage amd has been recognized as a major challenge to the global mining industry due to its environmental consequences lime neutralization has been a traditional treatment for amd but the abundance of iron and sulfate in amd usually renders it ineffective by forming iron hydroxide and gypsum precipitate coating on the surface of lime in light of ubiquitous biological mineralization phenomena present at amd sites a rapid chemical mineralization was developed to reduce iron and sulfate and recovery of iron from amd prior to lime neutralization through a cyclic reduction oxidation process by the addition of iron powder and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 over 90 fe3 and 40 so4 2 could be removed beforehand by forming schwertmannite the pretreated amd drastically reduced both the required lime slurry in the subsequent lime neutralization process and the amount of neutralized sludge the resultant schwertmannite had a specific surface area of 3 9 m2 g and a formula of fe8o8 oh 4 5 so4 1 75 this technique could reduce lime consumption increase metal level in neutralized sludge and harvest environmentally friendly materials these results demonstrate that the integrated chemical mineralization and lime neutralization treatment is expected to be widely used in practical application graphical abstract image 1 keywords acid mine drainage chemical mineralization schwertmannite lime neutralization 1 introduction acid mine drainage amd has caused serious environmental pollution all over the world especially where coal and gold mining activities are common akcil and koldas 2006 kefeni et al 2017 the main source of amd is the biotic oxidation of sulfide minerals e g pyrite pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite during and following mining operations blodau 2006 singer and stumm 1970 among which pyrite ore is the main material responsible for the generation of amd due to its ease of oxidation when exposed to oxygen water and microorganisms chen et al 2014 pierre louis et al 2015 after various oxidation reactions under different conditions the pyrite can be completely oxidized to generate excess amounts of h fe2 and so4 2 evangelou and zhang 1995 therefore amd poses severe threats to soil water resources and aquatic communities due to its low ph and high concentrations of potentially toxic dissolved metals iron aluminum manganese and other heavy metals metalloids in which arsenic is generally of the greatest concern and sulphate kefeni et al 2017 active chemical treatment is the most widely used technique for amd remediation which combines aeration with alkaline lime or limestone addition to promote the chemical oxidation of fe2 to fe3 and removes ions through the formation of ferric hydroxide and calcium sulfate precipitates hedin et al 1994 iii and trahan 1999 johnson and hallberg 2005 however two major shortcomings limit this technique s wide application in practical treatment processes santomartino and webb 2007 1 it usually generates voluminous sludge that takes up more disposal space 2 the abundant metal ions especially that of iron existing in amd are hard to be recycled the abundant iron and sulphate that exists in amd are the main cause of large quantities of sludge because they can deteriorate the lime treatment system and reduce neutralization efficacy by forming precipitate coating on lime grains namely iron and sulfate are urgently needed to be eliminated from amd beforehand in order to alleviate the treatment burden of lime neutralization inspired by the ubiquitous biomineralization phenomena found at amd sites bioreactor systems have seen extensive research to selectively recover metal from amd in recent years two microorganism phyla acidophilic sulfate reducing bacteria srb hedrich and johnson 2014 ňancucheo et al 2012 and acidophilic iron oxidation autotroph hedrich and johnson 2012 were used to selectively precipitate metal ions via the formation of metal sulfides or iron hydroxysulfates respectively compared with srb the latter is more suitable for practical application owing to the following three aspects 1 no exogenous carbon source is required because the chemolithoautotroph such as acidthiobacillus ferrooxidans a ferrooxidans can acquire energy from autotrophic metabolic pathways 2 no anaerobic environment is required and 3 the resultant iron hydroxysulfates have direct utilization potentials in the field of environment science among these iron hydroxysulfates schwertmannite of a weakly crystalline form with a variable chemical formula of fe8o8 oh 8 2x so4 x where x ranges from 1 to 1 75 bao et al 2018 vithana et al 2015 xiong et al 2008 has been considered to have the potential as one of the most environmentally friendly materials due to its excellent adsorption capacity for dissolved metal and metalloid elements carlson et al 2002 richmond et al 2004 fernandez rojo et al 2017 indeed biomineralization can decrease iron and sulfate concentrations in amd and thus save the cost associated with chemicals dosed in the subsequent lime neutralization however there are still some disadvantages limiting its practical application in full scale the ambient condition for biomineralization is relatively rigorous causing the properties of the solution in question including ph value temperature dissolved oxygen content and ion species among others to play crucial roles in the success of the process regenspurg et al 2004 vithana et al 2015 in addition the relatively high costs involved in the construction and operation of such biological treatment systems have a direct impact on their further scale up fortunately chemical mineralization that mimics biological ones through the utilization of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 has been reported as a simple and rapid method to fabricate schwertmannite from feso4 solution duan et al 2016 liu et al 2015a regenspurg et al 2004 compared with the biosynthetic pathway the preparation conditions and chemical properties of the resultant schwertmannite produced in this chemical synthesis route are much easier to control however to our knowledge the chemical fabrication of schwertmannite has only been conducted with feso4 reagent of analytical grade purity as the iron and sulfate source in laboratory and has not proceeded into the application of practical amd treatment yet let alone the efficiency and degree of mineralization in practical treatment which warrants a detailed study here this study proposes a novel treatment technique that integrates chemical mineralization and lime neutralization to dispose practical amd the objectives were 1 to investigate the feasibility and efficiency of iron and sulfate recovery 2 to identify the physicochemical properties of the resultant schwertmannite and 3 to evaluate the application potential of this novel technique 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification iron powder fe0 copper powder cu0 h2o2 30 w v hcl hno3 hclo4 cao 1 10 phenanthroline hydroxylamine hydrochloride and acetic acid sodium were all purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china amd was collected from mine effluent of the abandoned dexing copper mine located in jiangxi china 29 01 00 n 117 44 0 e which was once the largest open pit copper mine in asia the sample was kept in a refrigerator at 4 c prior to chemical experiments and analyses the main ion components and ph values of such raw amd samples are presented in table 1 2 2 experimental section 2 2 1 chemical mineralization chemical mineralization was conducted in 500 ml shaking flasks containing 200 ml amd and operated in a cyclic regime by sequencing through two steps 1 reduction and filtration 2 oxidation and separation in the first step fe0 or cu0 was added whose dosages were half of the fe3 that existed in the 200 ml amd to be treated the reduction process was initiated by shaking these flasks at 180 rpm on a rotary shaker at 28 c liquid samples of 2 ml were taken 2 h later and subjected to fe2 and residual fe3 analysis after passing through a 0 45 μm filter membrane once the fe2 concentration did not increase any further residual fe0 or cu0 was removed from the liquid by either magnetism or filtration and step two was introduced by the addition of h2o2 the dosage of h2o2 was calculated according to the fe2 concentration that was determined from the first step at a molar ratio 0 8 of h2o2 fe2 the molar ratio of h2o2 fe2 chosen here was based on the following two considerations 1 the fe2 oxidation reaction 2fe2 h2o2 2h 2fe3 2h2o required a molar ratio of at least 0 5 2 certain amounts of soluble organic matter may exist in amd and cause an over consumption of h2o2 the oxidation process was conducted under the same circumstances as the reduction process except the incubation time was prolonged to 24 h to achieve a thorough reaction at the end of this step membrane separation was applied to collect the precipitate and the resultant supernatant was poured back to the flask it is worthy to mention that a certain amount of deionized water was added to the supernatant to compensate for the water loss during the two step operation because constant volume was the basis of accurate stoichiometric calculation when the liquid volume was brought back to 200 ml by the weight method a second reduction oxidation round was started this cyclic reduction oxidation process is schematically illustrated in fig 1 a 2 2 2 iron relevant calculations in each reduction process the fe3 reduction ratio was calculated based on equation 1 1 fe 3 reduction c red fe 3 c red res fe 3 c red fe 3 100 where c red fe 3 and c red res fe 3 are the initial and residual supernatant fe3 concentration mm in the corresponding reduction process respectively a total iron removal ratio relative to raw amd after each oxidation process was calculated based on equation 2 2 total fe removal c 0 fe t c cm res fe t c 0 fe t 100 where c 0 fe t is the initial iron concentration mm of raw amd and c cm res fe t is the residual supernatant fe3 concentration mm determined at the end of each oxidation process the cumulative precipitated iron concentration mm after each chemical mineralization cycle was calculated according to equation 3 3 cumulative iron precipitate mm 0 n c cm 0 fe t c red fe 0 2 c cm res fe t where c cm 0 fe t and c red fe 0 2 are the concentrations of initial supernatant fe3 and fe2 introduced by fe0 determined in each reduction process respectively while n represents the number of cycles of chemical mineralization 2 2 3 lime neutralization to investigate the metal ion removal capability by traditional lime neutralization 5 w v cao slurry was added dropwise to 50 ml of raw amd to get a ph gradient ranging from 3 to 12 at each indicated ph value 2 ml of liquid sample was withdrawn and subjected to a residual metal ion assay accordingly during this process the endpoint of lime neutralization was determined as a specific ph value at which over 90 of the metal ions were precipitated subsequently ph values of 50 ml amd samples either untreated or pretreated by fe0 mediated chemical mineralization were adjusted to the neutralization endpoint by the addition of cao slurry after which the residual metal ion concentration and resultant neutralized sludge amount were determined and subjected to comparison 2 3 analytical methods solution ph was measured with a phs 3c model digital ph meter mettler toledo switzerland water samples were prepared by filtering through 0 45 μm filters metal ions including fe3 al3 ca2 mg2 cu2 zn2 and mn2 were assayed by a shimadzu icps 7500 inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer icp aes shimadzu japan while so4 2 concentrations were determined by a dionex ic 1100 ion chromatography system thermo fisher usa whenever it was necessary to distinguish between fe3 and fe2 fe2 concentration was determined before and after the sample was reduced by excess ascorbic acid apha 1981 harvey et al 1955 using the ferrozine colorimetric assay with a t 6 spectrophotometer philes china fe3 concentration was then calculated based on the difference between such two measurements the precipitates collected at the end of each chemical mineralization cycle with fe0 as reductant were washed twice with deionized water and then fully dried in a drying oven at 60 c crystal structures were measured by a rotaflex d max x ray powder diffraction xrd rigaku japan with a cu kα radiation source 50 kv 150 ma the morphology was observed by an s 3400n scanning electron microscope sem hitachi japan equipped with a philips xl 30e instrument operated at a 20 kv accelerating voltage the elemental composition was examined by energy disperse spectroscopy eds 20 kv mn kα the fe3 and so4 2 contents in iron precipitate was determined by icp aes and ion chromatography after acid dissolution with hclo4 the nitrogen sorption isotherms of the precipitates were collected at 77 k using a tri star ii 3020 automatic specific surface and porosity analyzer micromeritics usa after which the brunauer emmett teller bet method was used to calculate their specific surface areas 3 results and discussion 3 1 water quality of raw amd amd collected from dexing copper mine jiangxi china had a typical acidity with a ph value of 2 2 table 1 so4 2 was the dominant anion with a concentration of 8011 mg l besides fe3 1235 mg l al3 560 mg l and ca2 240 mg l were shown to be the other main metal species these properties were in accordance with the reported conventional amd results carrero et al 2015 feng et al 2000 fitzpatrick et al 2017 casiot et al 2003 except that fe3 rather than fe2 was the dominant iron species this could be attributed to the occurrence of a long term biotic and abiotic oxidation in the aerobic environment when the samples were exposed to in the abandoned open pit mine when traditional direct neutralization was applied to treat the raw amd by adjusting the ph with cao slurry the presence of metal ions and so4 2 in the materials over consumed cao and increased the amount of neutralized sludge this conclusion was evidenced by the neutralization of 1 l of raw amd to ph 7 5 consuming 3 3 g of cao and resulting in 11 1 g of sludge table 1 however in practice such application may cause a hindrance to treatment facilities therefore direct lime neutralization does not seem to be an effective option for amd remediation 3 2 chemical mineralization mineralization is an important natural process in the conversion of soluble ions to solid chemical materials through which the metal ions in amd can be eliminated for example schwertmannite was formed through fe3 hydrolysis and precipitation with so4 2 when fe2 was oxidized by bacteria in amd sites reaction 4 and 5 bigham et al 1996b jambor and dutrizac 1998 4 fe 2 1 4 o 2 h a f e r r o o x i d a n s fe 3 1 2 h 2 o 5 fe 3 7 4 h 2 o 1 8 so 4 2 1 8 fe 8 o 8 oh 6 so 4 11 4 h it should be noted that the fe3 could not react with so4 2 in the absence of a ferrooxidans which might be due to the lack of reaction energy supplied by the oxidation process of fe2 to fe3 regenspurg et al 2004 that is also why the aforementioned studies directly used feso4 solution as the research object liu et al 2015a these valuable findings indicated that specific to the practical amd treated by this study in which fe3 is the dominant iron species a pre reduction of fe3 to fe2 is a prerequisite that can be realized by the addition of either fe0 reaction 6 or cu0 reaction 7 served as control thereafter a rapid chemical mineralization can be followed by using h2o2 as an alternative oxidant in the absence of a ferrooxidans reaction 8 and 5 6 fe 3 1 2 fe 0 3 2 fe 2 7 fe 3 1 2 cu 0 fe 2 1 2 cu 2 8 fe 2 1 2 h 2 o 2 h fe 3 h 2 o 3 2 1 iron specie conversion during chemical mineralization roughly 80 fe3 was reduced to fe2 by fe0 or cu0 at the end of the first reduction process fig 1b whereas the resultant fe2 concentration after fe0 reduction was much higher than that of cu0 it is clear that the fe0 that took part in the reaction was converted to fe2 as well reaction 6 which increased the concentration of fe2 in the solution accordingly the fe2 generated in this reduction process was then oxidized to fe3 within 24 h after the addition of h2o2 during which period partial fe3 underwent hydrolysis and precipitation reactions accompanied with these oxidative processes was a visible solution color change from light green to reddish brown and the gradual appearance of orange colored precipitates however only about 35 of fe3 was removed through precipitation meaning 65 of fe3 still existed in solution at the end of the first oxidation process fig 1b though this low mineralization ratio has also been reported in previous studies on either biomineralization or chemical mineralization processes liao et al 2009 liu et al 2015a 2015b xu et al 2014 the underlying mechanism is still unclear and warrants a further research 3 2 2 elimination of fe3 and so4 2 by cyclic chemical mineralization as mentioned above after one reduction oxidation process i e chemical mineralization there was still a substantial amount of iron left in the supernatant whose species was converted to fe3 again due to h2o2 oxidation which would not react with so4 2 anymore therefore to achieve more fe3 removal and higher mineral yield fe3 needed to be reduced back to fe2 and then oxidized again namely cyclic chemical mineralization had to be performed to treat amd as shown in fig 2 a in each reduction process of the following chemical mineralization cycles the fe3 reduction ratio still kept a steady range from 70 to 82 by utilizing either fe0 or cu0 as the reductant the increased cycles did improve total fe3 removal ratio over 95 of fe3 in raw amd could be removed after either 8 or 15 cycles mediated by cu0 or fe0 respectively fig 2b although cu0 mediated mineralization could remove the same amount of total fe3 with fewer cycles its resultant cumulative iron precipitates were far less than that mediated by fe0 fig 2c in addition slope k value comparison of the dashed lines in fig 2c clearly demonstrates that the iron precipitate cumulation rate after fe0 reduction was much faster than that by cu0 this was because fe0 was partly oxidized to fe2 during the reduction process reaction 6 which increased the total fe2 concentration at the end of this process fig 1b this portion of extra fe2 can also be oxidized to fe3 by h2o2 which would further hydrolyze and precipitate with so4 2 as iron hydroxysulfates reaction 5 as such fe0 mediated mineralization cycle proceeded the gradual decrease of total fe3 concentration caused a concomitant decline of the fe2 increment especially after ten cycles fig 2d which corresponded to a lower iron precipitate cumulation rate fig 2c even so the total fe fe t removal amount still showed a decreasing trend in each cyclic chemical mineralization thereafter fig 2d as a result both the iron mineral yield and so4 2 removal ratio were about four times larger when fe0 was used as the reductant fig 3 in other words a higher efficiency of total fe3 precipitation corresponds to more iron mineral synthesis the chemical mineralization with fe0 as the reductant significantly increased the amount of cumulative iron precipitates and the efficiency of so4 2 removal conversely cu0 mediated reduction brought high levels of cu2 1864 mg l after eight cycles table 1 which would increase the disposal burden in the following treatment in addition any excess unreacted fe0 could be easily separated by a magnet therefore fe0 was more suitable for fe3 reduction in chemical mineralization after treated with 15 cycles of chemical mineralization fe3 and so4 2 concentrations decreased from 1235 4 and 8011 2 mg l to 170 1 and 5005 7 mg l respectively table 1 solution ph values have been reported as a critical influence factor for the synthesis of iron hydroxysulfates liao et al 2009 liu et al 2015a after each reduction process solution ph values increased to a range of 2 8 3 0 owing to the fact that h was consumed by partial fe0 in the subsequent oxidation process fe3 formed by h2o2 oxidation was hydrolyzed in solution the acid produced in this process reduced the ph value and caused it to stabilize at approximately 2 4 fig 4 thus ferric hydroxysulphate was formed by a competing reaction between ferric hydrolysate and sulphate in the ph range of 2 4 3 0 according to previous reports pure mineral phase is easily formed in this ph range
