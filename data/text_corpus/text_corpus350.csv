1750,in aquatic ecosystems phytoplankton is a key primary producer that is highly sensitive to environmental change understanding ecological succession in lake phytoplankton community structure is important when tracking associated long term environmental response such information can be used to develop a comprehensive management strategy under changing environment this study reconstructs long term 100 year scale phytoplankton community succession from sediment pigments in a typical floodplain lake poyang lake revealing potential lacustrine ecosystem response mechanisms to climate nutrition hydrology factors results show that poyang lake s algal community has undergone rapid growth with diatoms increasing by 9 3 cryptophytes increasing by 8 7 and green algae decreasing by 26 3 in poyang lake the point of change in algal community succession occurred after 1965 representing a 5 15 year delayed response compared to lakes around the world largely due to the coupled effects of the unique hydrological fluctuations and anthropogenic disturbances additionally sediment pigments were also used to accurately track four atypical algal outbreaks in poyang lake i e 1955 1960 1975 1984 and 2003 our results emphasize the importance of hydrological conditions during ecological succession processes in floodplain lakes here coupling effects between water levels and other relevant factors

evolving under multi source coupling pressure climate nutrient hydrology keywords sediment pigment phytoplankton ecological succession multi source coupling pressure floodplain lake data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rapid economic and social development over the past century has led to pollution climate change and other environmental stressors which have engendered a wide range of impacts on highly sensitive lake ecosystems strongly altering lake primary productivity and phytoplankton community structure heino et al 2021 pacheco et al 2021 birk et al 2020 exploring the mechanisms by which lake ecological succession responds to multiple stressors on a near century scale is critical to developing integrated ecological management strategies hayes et al 2015 phytoplankton pigments preserved in lake sediment faithfully preserve information on the ecological evolution of lakes while also being a commonly used tool to reconstruct lake phytoplankton community succession providing a basis for the comprehensive identification of lake ecosystem response processes under a background of climate change bourel et al 2021 klamt et al 2021 szymczak żyła et al 2016 pigments are widely found in organisms such as algae photosynthetic bacteria macrophytes and terrestrial plants while possessing certain taxonomic properties given that both the content and type of sediment pigments are closely related to the structure and abundance of primary producer communities in recent years sediment pigments have been widely used as biomarkers in the study of ecological community structure klamt et al 2021 deshpande et al 2014 freiberg et al 2011 primary productivity szymczak żyła et al 2011 and nutrient levels montes et al 2021 hofmann et al 2021 in lakes a relatively stable environment is an important prerequisite when using sediment pigments to accurately record lake ecological succession processes the lake environments in these areas are relatively stable and the sediments are in a good state of preservation having avoided any obvious destructive disturbances strong hydrological variability can interfere with the accuracy of palaeolake marsh indicators and there is currently a relative paucity of ecological reconstruction studies using sediment pigments in floodplain lakes with strong hydrological variability our previous study emphasized that for floodplain lakes which are susceptible to seasonal flooding sediment pigments in certain areas still can accurately discern phytoplankton community structure in the overlying water column li et al 2022 this means that sediment pigments can still be used to reconstruct the ecological succession of a floodplain lake under complex hydrological conditions the inversion of lake ecological succession processes through multi proxy palaeolake marsh indicators is essential for the development of lake management strategies through deducing the impact of increased multi source stressors e g anthropogenic activities and climate change on lake ecosystems over the past century for almost a century lake ecosystems around the world have been extensively impacted by multiple stressors while also being threatened by declining water quality and intensive phytoplankton blooms taranu et al 2015 ho et al 2019 birk et al 2020 in particular after the 1950s the coupled effects of climate change and anthropogenic activities have caused abrupt ecological change in lakes globally huang et al 2022 lin et al 2021 alterations caused by anthropogenically derived increases in lake nutrient concentrations e g nitrogen and phosphorus on resident phytoplankton communities are often direct and significant paerl et al 2011 for example anthropogenic dust emissions have caused a 2 3 fold increase in lake phosphorus concentrations in the mountainous region of the southwestern united states of america leading to a 10 fold increase in diatom production brahney et al 2015 moreover global climate change indirectly affects regional lake ecosystems through rising temperatures and alterations in precipitation patterns yang et al 2016 bartosiewicz et al 2019 reported that climate warming can explain 78 of the cyanobacteria biomass change observed in lakes which is the main driving mechanism behind lake ecological succession for floodplain lakes the impact of hydrological changes on the ecology of the lake is perhaps much higher than other climatic factors the risk of water level decline in poyang lake has increased significantly since 2003 due to the declining water level of the yangtze river li et al 2023 however studies considering the impact of hydrological changes on lake ecological succession on long time scale have not been reported indeed whether it is caused by an increase in nutrition loads under anthropogenic activities or a change in the regional environment under climate change impacts caused by these multi source pressures on lake ecosystems do not occur independently many studies have identified complex coupling relationships between multi source pressure that together alter lake systems huang et al 2022 birk et al 2020 for example a study conducted at chaohu lake china confirmed that the multi source coupling pressure that leads to changes in lake ecosystems occasionally occurs asynchronously zhang et al 2019 the coupling of multi source pressure is dependent on the trophic state of lakes especially eutrophic lakes where a significant synergy exists between climatic conditions and nutrients in promoting lake algal communities lin et al 2021 rigosi et al 2014 in addition to the general characteristics of shallow lakes ecological processes of floodplain lakes also respond to changing hydrological conditions e g flow change water level fluctuation etc which affect their ecological stability and biogeochemical cycling rate mcgowan et al 2011 siev et al 2016 as far as floodplain lakes are concerned global climate change and anthropogenic activities have led to fundamental changes in lake hydrological conditions and the role that changing hydrological conditions play in long term ecological lake succession remains unclear wolfe et al 2006 bhattacharya et al 2016 the intent of this study was to explore phytoplankton community succession in a large subtropical floodplain lake over the past century and to reveal the potential response of lake ecological succession processes to coupled multi source pressure i e climate change nutrient inputs and hydrological conditions the general aim of this study was to offer a novel perspective on the long term integrated management of watersheds accordingly this study focused on three specific objectives i to analyze phytoplankton community succession in a floodplain lake over the past century ii to explore the effects of climate change and nutrient inputs on lake phytoplankton community succession iii to understand the driving mechanisms associated with the unique hydrological characteristics of floodplain lakes to the ecological succession of such lakes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area poyang lake 115 49 116 46 e 28 24 29 46 n is located in the middle reache of the yangtze river which is china s largest freshwater lake with a total watershed area of 1 62 105 km2 accounting for 9 of the total yangtze river basin area fig 1 a freshwater inflow into poyang lake mainly derives from five tributaries i e gan river fu river xin river rao river and xiu river and discharges into the yangtze river at the hukou station through a narrow water channel fig 1b yao et al 2015 poyang lake is a typical floodplain lake system wherein its lake area fluctuates between 4000 km2 during the rainy season and 1000 km2 during the dry season song et al 2021 lake water level fluctuated greatly intra annual i e 7 9 m 19 4 m exhibiting hydrological characteristics that have been described as a river in the dry season and a lake in the rainy season liu et al 2015 the region is within a subtropical monsoon climatic zone with an average annual rainfall of 1622 mm the rainy season is from march to september accounting for greater than 80 of the annual rainfall with an average annual temperature of 17 5 c jia et al 2020 poyang lake plays an important role in regulating yangtze river water levels while also protecting its water quality and maintaining its ecological stability liu et al 2017 li et al 2020 indicated that the phytoplankton community in poyang lake is dominated by cyanobacteria based on existing monthly monitoring data it has been shown that the density of phytoplankton has increased by 3 4 times since 2011 xiong et al 2021 in recent decades which has seen the development of the economic zone around poyang lake such as the construction of dams the development of fisheries and the rise of sand mining activities poyang lake s water environment has continuously deteriorated jia et al 2019 overall the water quality of poyang lake is decreasing from 2011 to 2015 and the water quality slightly improves from 2016 to 2019 but eutrophication still exists which has severely threatened the water safety and ecological stability of its surrounding environment xie et al 2022 2 2 sample core collection and screening this study conducted a historical survey of poyang lake at sites where sample cores were collected this was combined with information collected from local residents to ensure that no significant anthropogenic disturbances e g sand mining and river dredging had historically occurred around the sample cores thus ensuring that physicochemical sediment indicators were fully representative of the overlying water column in april 2021 we selected 14 alternative sediment sampling sites s1 s14 that were evenly distributed across the lake area where 40 cm sediment sample cores were collected using the chinese manufactured xdb0205 gravity column sediment sampler 5 5 mm inner diameter fig 1b samples were immediately separated at 1 cm intervals and then placed in opaque self sealing bags after freezing 20 c they were transported to the institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research chinese academy of sciences igsnrr cas all samples were weighed before and after lyophilization 48 h 0 1 pa to calculate moisture content and then processed for subsequent analysis it is important to note that unlike typical shallow lakes sediment pigments in floodplain lakes tend to be poorly preserved this made it necessary to screen the 14 sample cores and select those with well preserved pigment information for lake algae reconstruction li et al 2022 through a comparative analysis of the surface pigments of the 14 alternative sediment cores we first ascertained that there was a serious loss in pigment information at all sampling points except s8 consequently losing its significance as a lake ecology proxy index fig s1 in this study s8 28 996 n 116 336 e with the highest pigment concentration and the richest pigment species was therefore selected as the sampling site for the ecological reconstruction of poyang lake s phytoplankton community fig 1c 2 3 laboratory analyses 2 3 1 sediment chronology lyophilized and sieved sediment samples were evenly added to 7 ml centrifuge tubes 5 7 g sample and compacted to add more samples to improve measurement accuracy samples were then sealed in a sealing film and left for 3 4 weeks after which they were transported to beijing normal university where the samples were measured for excess lead 210 210pbex and cesium 137 137cs activity using a high purity germanium γ energy spectrometer ortec usa and a gwl 120 15 well type high purity germanium probe with a dspec jr 2 0 multi channel digital spectrometer the sample measurement time was set to 80000 s pedrosa garcia et al 2020 the 210pbex chronology was calculated according to the constant rate of supply crs model using the following equation krishnaswamy et al 1971 a a 0 e λ t where a0 is the total 210pbex input bq cm 2 in the sediment cores a is the cumulative 210pbex input bq cm 2 in the sediment cores at depth m and below λ is the decay constant of 210pbex 0 03114 a 1 t is the age of each sediment layer the maximum 137cs activity value was used as the timescale to determine 1963 2 3 2 sediment geochemical and pigment analysis the total carbon tc concentration in sediment was determined using an elemental carbon nitrogen analyzer vario max n cn elemantar germany the total nitrogen tn concentration in sediment was obtained using a digestion method and then determined using flow injection analysis allance organic matter om was determined using the loss on ignition loi method 550 c ignition temperature for 2 h through quality differences before and after sediment om calculations beaudoin 2003 the lyophilized samples were ground to a powder using a mortar and pestle under dark conditions approximately 1 g of the sample was weighed in a 10 ml glass centrifuge tube ptfe spacer wrapped in tin foil to prevent light exposure and 6 ml of an extraction reagent 80 hplc acetone 15 methanol 5 water was then added the samples were centrifuged for 10 min 2500 rpm min after which the supernatant was aspirated with a syringe and filtered through a ptfe membrane 0 22 μm hydrophobic into a 10 ml brown colored sample bottle ptfe spacer blown dry with nitrogen and stored under frozen conditions blow dried samples were rehydrated with 800 μl of the reagent 70 hplc acetone 25 ipr 5 methanol transferred to 2 ml brown colored sample bottles and mechanically analyzed sediment pigments were analyzed using an agilent technologies high performance liquid chromatography 1260 series with a quaternary pump an auto sampler a poroshell 120 ec c18 column 150 3 0 mm 2 7 μm particle size and a photodiode array pda detector lin et al 2021 li et al 2022 this study used the extraction and separation pigment procedure modified by chen et al 2001 the collected sample core pigment was identified and quantitatively analyzed by comparing the maximum absorption wavelength 440 nm 620 nm retention time and peak area at characteristic wavelength with the danish hydraulic institute dhi pigment standards and expressed as nmol g organic matter om 2 4 data source historical poyang lake tn and total phosphorus tp concentration measurements were obtained from ma et al 2021 while historical water level data were obtained from the xingzi hydrological station fig 2 b historical precipitation data of the poyang lake basin were obtained from the national tibetan plateau data center https data tpdc ac cn the monthly precipitation dataset of china at a 1 km resolution peng 2020 and historical temperature data at a 1 km resolution were obtained from the a big earth data platform for three poles https poles tpdc ac cn peng 2019 both datasets have a spatial resolution of 0 0083333 1 km and both span the period between 1901 and 2020 additionally both datasets were generated from the global 0 5 climate dataset published by the climate research unit cru and the global high resolution climate dataset published by worldclim https www worldclim org we used the delta spatial downscaling process to downscale the chinese region both datasets were validated using data from 496 meteorological observation points and results were verified to be credible using modelbuilder in arcgis monthly precipitation and temperature raster data were extracted in batches data were then cropped according to the study area and combined and counted to obtain the annual average precipitation and the annual average temperature of the poyang lake basin because precipitation data from 1996 was missing corresponding precipitation data from 1995 and 1997 were averaged and then used for 1996 3 results 3 1 establishing the chronological sequence of sediment and associated sedimentation rate characteristics as shown in fig 2a the specific activity of 210pbex vertically sectioned tended to decrease with depth where upper core section 0 12 cm values were much higher compared to lower section core 12 40 cm values the average specific activity of 210pbex in the upper core section was 258 59 bq kg 1 with a maximum value of 363 25 bq kg 1 at the surface 6 cm the average specific activity of 210pbex in the lower core section was 31 24 bq kg 1 with a minimum value of 9 39 bq kg 1 at the bottom of the core i e 34 cm the average specific activity of 137cs in the core section was 4 32 bq kg 1 with a peak of 10 72 bq kg 1 at 34 cm and a secondary peak of 4 96 bq kg 1 at a 6 cm depth from the sediment surface based on the data from the specific activity of 210pbex a chronology of 40 cm sample cores was constructed using the crs model in combination with linear interpolation and the sediment mass accumulation rate mar was then calculated fig 2b the bottom 40 cm of poyang lake column cores corresponded to 1898 combined with the 137cs profile distribution 34 cm corresponded to 1963 however it did not match the 1963 values obtained from crs model calculations at approx 26 cm cs is an alkali metal most of its salt is soluble and its potential for upward and downward migration is high following deposition gao et al 2021 unlike cs the salt solubility of pb is extremely low it does not easily migrate upwards or downwards through interstitial water while it can stably exist in sediment therefore when the two radionuclides yield an obvious date difference dating will be based on 210pbex the mar exhibited a general increasing and subsequent decreasing trend with an average mar value of 0 17 g cm 2 yr 1 from 1959 to 1993 the mar value of poyang lake was significantly higher than other periods p 0 05 reaching a historical peak 0 39 g cm 2 yr 1 at around 1963 since the 1990s the mar value of poyang lake has gradually decreased and has maintained an average of approximately 0 10 g cm 2 yr 1 3 2 distribution characteristics of sediment geophysical and chemical index profiles trends in water content om tc and tn concentrations in sediment sample cores were basically the same all abruptly increasing at around the 1980s and reaching a peak at around 2000 fig 3 the average om content in surface sediment 0 10 cm was 18 33 which was much higher than the average om content in the intermediate and lower layers 5 64 trends in tc and tn concentrations in sediment sample cores were basically consistent with average concentrations of 25 17 mg kg 1 and 2 20 mg kg 1 respectively both exhibiting an annual increasing trend between 1984 and 2008 7 19 cm the c n trend was generally characterized by an increase and subsequent decrease peaking at 26 52 in 1946 31 cm followed by 17 93 in 1959 28 cm the mean c n for the remaining period was 11 36 whose range varied between 9 61 and 13 94 for which the sediment surface 1 cm yielded the lowest value the changing trend in the volumetric weight of sediment was opposite to that of other indicators increasing in the first 20 cm before being maintained at 1 27 g cm 3 with an increase in sediment depth the permeability coefficient decreased under compaction while the volumetric weight of sediment increased volumetric weight distribution characteristics in sediment core profiles substantiated poyang lake s good sediment compaction and bottom sediment stability 3 3 historical changes in climate nutrient and hydrologic conditions in poyang lake in poyang lake the precipitation trend over the past century 1901 2017 was a general decreasing fluctuation at a mean annual precipitation rate of 1497 96 mm fig 4 a the low point in precipitation occurred at around 1925 where the average annual precipitation remained below 1320 mm for five consecutive years and where the average precipitation was only 1165 44 mm additionally two periods of extremely high precipitation occurred in 1949 and 1954 with precipitation rates of 1961 40 mm and 2126 88 mm respectively contrary to mean annual precipitation the trend in mean annual temperature was characterized by a general increasing fluctuation i e 0 01 c annually moreover poyang lake s average annual temperature increased by approximately 1 3 c during this 100 year period fig 4b generally poyang lake had three distinct periods in annual average temperature change the first period was from 1901 to 1948 where temperatures fluctuated and continued to increase during this period the temperature of poyang lake began to increase rapidly from 16 96 c in 1901 at an increasing rate of 0 02 c per year reaching its current level of 18 18 c in 1948 the second period was from 1949 to 1993 where the temperature of poyang lake gradually stabilized and was basically maintained at approximately 17 64 c the third period was after 1994 when annual average temperatures began to gradually increase once again this final increase rate in temperature was comparatively lower than the first stage but its average temperature was as high as 18 27 c therefore the third period from 1994 onwards yielded the highest recorded temperature in poyang lake over the past century the average tn concentration in poyang lake was 1 26 mg l 1 exhibiting an overall increasing trend especially in 2017 and 2018 when the tn concentration was 2 12 mg l 1 and 3 42 mg l 1 respectively namely a respective increase in magnitude of 1 7 and 2 7 the average tp concentration was 0 19 mg l 1 reaching a historical peak 0 63 mg l 1 at around 2004 since then tp concentrations have exhibited a fluctuating downward trend with tp concentrations increasing once again to 0 40 mg l 1 in 2018 over the past 60 years poyang lake s average water level was 13 34 m however there was a significant decrease in its water level after the completion of the three gorges dam at its lowest point the water level decreased by 0 49 m the average water level was lower than 1 10 m at its highest the water level decreased by 1 11 m after the completion of the three gorges dam fig 4d 3 4 distribution of poyang lake sediment pigment profiles this study s sediment pigment analysis accurately traced the evolution of phytoplankton communities and associated productivity within a large shallow lake over the past century fig 5 in total 11 pigments were identified in poyang lake sediment generally sediment pigment concentrations gradually decreased with increasing depth where there were significant concentration differences among the different pigments p 0 05 for example alloxanthin from cryptophytes was mainly distributed in upper sediment layers 0 13 cm with an average concentration of 4 29 nmol g 1 om the lowest canthaxanthin concentration from cyanobacteria was detected in sample cores averaging only 0 88 nmol g 1 om however pigment was widely distributed within sediment where 0 23 nmol g 1 om was also detected in the lowest section of the sample cores chlorophyll b chl b was used along with its degradation products deg chl b including pheophytin b and pheophytin b to indicate past chlorophyte dynamics in the lake their concentrations followed a consistent trend in sediment with mean concentrations of 4 93 nmol g 1 om 97 67 nmol g 1 om and 78 50 nmol g 1 om chlorophyll a chl a and its degradation products deg chl a including pheophytin a and pheophytin a were indicative of the lake s total algal community and productivity levels which widely present in sediment at an average concentration of 23 26 nmol g 1 om 4 discussion 4 1 successional characteristics of phytoplankton communities over the past century coniss cluster analysis of pigment assemblages showed that the most significant changes in algal communities occurred in 1959 and 1992 fig 6 a our corresponding non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis tracked three stratigraphic sediment pigment concentration assemblages in poyang lake fig 6b phytoplankton succession in the lake over the last century was divided into three distinct periods based on changes in stratigraphic sediment pigment concentrations period i 1898 1958 period ii 1959 1991 and period iii 1992 to present the lower sediment pigment concentration during period i indicated that phytoplankton biomass and productivity was low in poyang lake during this period period ii showed an increasing fluctuation trend in sediment pigment concentrations during this period a peak pigment concentration was detected in 1969 indicative of an atypical proliferation of the lake algae community since 1992 the pigment concentration reached its highest level in recorded history where the pigment concentration was greater by a magnitude of 2 35 compared to that of the previous period indicating a significant increase in poyang lake phytoplankton biomass and productivity based on pigment concentration characteristics from different phytoplankton we calculated their individual share of the total pigment which is a technique often used to reflect changes in phytoplankton biomass over time zhang et al 2019 fig 7 our study showed that phytoplankton community structure in the poyang lake basin has changed significantly over the past century according to coniss classification fig 6a and the sediment pigment percentage map fig 7 phytoplankton community succession in poyang lake over the past century can be broadly classified into three distinct stages namely the stable period period i the fluctuation period period ii and the ensuing stable period period iii chlorophytes and cyanobacteria taxa were the most dominant phytoplankton communities in poyang lake which consistently accounted for greater than 50 of the overall phytoplankton community during our previous field monitoring campaign li et al 2020 we determined that cyanobacteria are currently the dominant phytoplankton species in poyang lake followed by chlorophytes which is consistent with the findings of this study during the fluctuation period period ii 1959 1991 the structure of the various phytoplankton communities changed dramatically mainly with respect to a significant decline in chlorophyte community biomass and a significant increase in diatom biomass from the fluctuation period to the ensuing stable period period iii 1992 to present the proportion of diatom biomass in poyang lake increased from approximately 22 0 to 31 3 and the proportion of cryptophyte biomass rapidly increased from 1 1 to 9 8 namely an increase of nearly 10 fold while chlorophyte biomass decreased from 43 1 to 16 8 by 1992 during the ensuing stable period poyang lake s phytoplankton community structure regained relative stability it is worth noting that total algal biomass during this period was much higher than that of the other two periods this was because the concentration of each pigment detected in sediment during the ensuing stable period was much higher than that detected during the other two periods it was determined that the trend in diatom biomass throughout poyang lake s historical period was roughly opposite to that of cyanobacteria biomass specifically cyanobacteria biomass was more abundant during periods of low diatom biomass in general diatoms explosive growth transferred nutrients from lake water to sediment making them unavailable for use by other algae species therefore cyanobacteria are more abundant during years when diatoms are sparse barker et al 2012 sediment pigment signals can be used to accurately infer atypical increases in lake algae providing a new means of monitoring lake ecology lake sediment pigments provide specific information on the evolution of algal communities and have been shown to be a reliable proxy in past eutrophication studies schneider et al 2018 cook et al 2016 pigment sample core distribution clearly showed signals of past algal blooms in the lake where algae accounted for greater than 80 of such events particularly cyanobacteria and chlorophytes since the 1950s atypical cyanobacteria and chlorophyte growth has often occurred in poyang lake and sediment pigment analysis was able to clearly trace four distinct algae bloom signals i e approx 1955 1960 1975 1984 and 2003 a previous survey showed that between 1955 and 1964 the forest cover surrounding the poyang lake basin decreased by 37 3 where soil erosion was severe by the mid 1960s the area of soil erosion surrounding the poyang lake basin reached 1 8 million hm2 hu 2001 such a large amount of soil organic matter promoted an increase in aquatic nutrient levels creating the conditions for the algal blooms detected at around 1960 qian et al 2016 found that cyanobacteria proliferated in poyang lake in 2007 which corresponds to an increase in cyanobacteria pigments that our study detected in sediment at around 2003 unlike the cyanobacteria and chlorophyte blooms in poyang lake the yangtze estuary situated within the same climatic zone is dominated by diatom and dinoflagellate blooms fang et al 2022 being a floodplain lake type poyang lake is susceptible to nutrient inputs and strong hydrodynamic conditions under eutrophic and well mixed water conditions cyanobacteria and chlorophyte compete better than diatoms under low light and turbid conditions thus cyanobacteria and chlorophytes always dominate algal bloom outbreaks in poyang lake zhang et al 2020 although poyang lake s algae community has generally changed significantly over the past century the succession process of different algae taxa remains unclear the point of rapid change in poyang lake s algal community mainly occurred after 1965 fig 8 representing a 5 15 year delayed response compared to similar lakes around the world steffen et al 2015 maheaux et al 2016 jane et al 2021 furthermore different algae taxa differed asynchronously in their ecological succession process for example the chlorophyte community initially changed in 1965 while the diatom community initially changed in 1967 during period ii i e fluctuation period 1959 1991 cyanobacteria experienced two periods of change i e 1981 and 1985 however the short interval between these two periods may in actual fact be the starting and ending point corresponding to the atypical growth of cyanobacteria biomass in 1984 since the mid 1980s nitrogen and phosphorus nutrient inputs into poyang lake have dramatically increased fig 3 which has promoted cyanobacteria community growth over an extended period i e 25 years 1985 2010 temporal changes in global lake ecosystems are typically asynchronous where ecological changes in lakes with a high human footprint e g lower and mid latitudinal lakes that feed the yangtze river occur later compared to lakes with a low human footprint e g alpine and arctic lakes huang et al 2022 this study extends the debate on lake ecological change specifically it shows that successional changes in different algal communities within a single lake biome are also asynchronous and this is dependent upon the response sensitivity of different algal taxa to environment stress 4 2 driving mechanisms of ecological succession in a floodplain lake over the past century the ecological succession which has taken place in freshwater ecosystems throughout the world over the past century can be explained by multi source environmental pressure i e climate change anthropogenic activity and pollution birk et al 2020 jenny et al 2020 at an intermediate to long term scale there has been a change in the factors that dominate lake ecosystem succession from single intense and well characterized stressors e g point source pollution to multi source coupled and complex stressors schäfer et al 2016 richardson et al 2018 however multi source stressors that impact lake ecosystems are ambiguous for lakes within temperate and subtropical regions where multi source stressors tend to mask one another rühland et al 2008 according to our research multi source pressure on lakes can be distinctly separated into four groups namely nutrition wtn wtp stn and stc climate precipitation and temperature hydrology wl and sediment transport mar fig 9 a the nutrient group is the main explanatory variable of axis constraint 1 accounting for 47 04 of algae community change while the climate hydrology and sediment transport groups are the main explanatory variables of axis constraint 2 5 41 our study emphasizes that nutrients are the main stressors that drive algal succession in the poyang lake basin this is because they possess the strongest explanatory power for algal community change on the ordination axis and primarily show a positive facilitative effect when accounting for the multi source pressure model secondary stressors can alleviate nutrient input stress however most lakes lack effective secondary stressors i e morphological changes heat stress hydrology etc thus the response of nutritional stress is typically stronger jeppesen et al 2005 nõges et al 2016 the geophysical and chemical data obtained from the lake cores indicated that nutrient inputs into poyang lake are currently increasing moreover the continuance of high flux inputs from this major stressor will significantly accelerate algal community succession over an extended period climate and hydrology have a negative influence on lake algal community succession moreover climate plays a weaker role than nutrients in long term lake ecological succession processes unlike lakes in other regions of the world this study highlights the fact that climate change does not appear to have a predictable and obvious impact on lake algae at least on a century scale yang et al 2016 deng et al 2018 gangi et al 2020 this is mainly due to poyang lake s relatively stable climate fig 4a and b therefore climate did not effectively impact its lake ecosystem additionally climate fluctuation is time averaged which requires further succession process subdivisions during the study period for floodplain lakes that undergo high hydrological fluctuations water level is a key controlling regulator of lake trophic status phytoplankton growth and gpp wu et al 2019 specifically periods of low water levels concentrate the available nutrient content that subsequently drive community based algal blooms wang et al 2021 lake ecological successional response to multi source pressure is both temporally and spatially uneven perga et al 2015 poyang lake s early stage period i 1898 1958 and current stage period iii 1992 to present developed well along axis constraint 2 while the intermediate stage period ii 1959 1991 developed mainly along axis constraint 1 this shows that the importance of stressors is dependent on the specific lake development stage over the past century poyang lake s dominant stressors evolved from climate to nutrient factors ultimately evolving to its current state i e a climate hydrology stressor type lake the alternating effects of climate change hydrological conditions and nutrient inputs on lake ecological succession depend upon its nutritional status lin et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 continuous nutrient inputs during the early stage of the lake lifted algae growth restrictions which led to the dominance of nutritional pressure however the continuance of nutrient inputs is no longer able to significantly alter the algae structure of the lake currently climate hydrology interventions have turned the lake into a climate hydrology pressure dominant type at a global scale climatic effects largely dominated lake succession prior to the 1950 s while nutrient inputs and pollution have often driven changes after 1950 huang et al 2022 jia et al 2022 although the abrupt ecological changing pattern of floodplain lakes is consistent with that of global lakes the mode of this abrupt change lags by approximately 10 years variance partitioning analysis vpa was used to measure multi source synergistic stress contributions to algal community succession over three distinct periods fig 9b c and d obvious and complex coupling effects were detected among multi source pressure factors and this effect was temporally asynchronous for floodplain lakes sediment transport can be seen as a parameter how the lake is affected by upstream sediment transport i e a potential indicator of exogenous nutrient transport in the intermediate period of the lake period ii nutrient source pressure including endogenous and exogenous factors coupled with other factors collectively explained 31 of algal community structure exogenous nutrient inputs alone explained 17 which roughly corresponded to the nutrient inputs caused by soil erosion during the mid twentieth century hu 2001 compared to period ii multi source stressors during period iii were more tightly coupled and complex and therefore more difficult to interpret climate trophic hydrological synergy had even strengthened especially climate trophic synergy which together explained 30 of phytoplankton community variation even though it was earlier stated that climate change had no obvious effect on lake succession on a one hundred year scale the effect of climate change has been very strong over the past 30 years this is due to an increase in poyang lake mat after 1992 which was considerably higher than the average increase over the past century increasing temperatures may affect both phytoplankton productivity and community by improving the stability and stratification of the water column especially in shallow eutrophic lakes wu et al 2018 janatian et al 2020 water level fluctuation is a key characteristic of floodplain lakes results from this study emphasize the key role that water level plays in long term lake succession processes during period ii and period iii coupling pressure between hydrology and other variables explained differences in algal communities i e by 20 and 32 respectively in floodplain lakes water level is the key hydrological connectivity index promoting exchanges in water sediment nutrients and organisms between upstream and downstream reaches keruzoré et al 2013 shi et al 2017 changes in water levels will result in changes in seasonal velocity and submerged areas which will strongly impact algal communities castillo 2020 after the three gorges dam was built 2003 poyang lake s water levels decreased by 1 1 m on average which to a certain extent affected its hydrological material exchange with the yangtze river while stagnant nutrient concentrations promoted algal growth in the lake additionally horizontal dragging and exchange of algae caused by high water levels during flood events may directly determine the algal community structure zalocar de domitrovic 2003 we believe that when explaining lake ecological pressure a hydrological dimension should be included based on conventional multi source climate nutrition coupling pressure which together constitute multi source climate nutrition hydrology coupling pressure 5 conclusions in this study four atypical algae outbreaks in poyang lake were accurately tracked using sediment pigments algal community succession was mainly characterized by a significant increase in total algal biomass where diatom and cryptophyte biomass increased and chlorophyte biomass decreased in poyang lake the point of change in algal community succession occurred after 1965 representing a 5 15 year delayed response compared to similar lakes around the world over the past century poyang lake s main stressors have evolved from climate and nutrient factors to the climatic hydrological stressors seen today this ecological succession pattern is consistent with lakes throughout the world with a temporal lag of approximately 10 years additionally we also believe that the influence of hydrological conditions on lake ecology cannot be ignored especially for floodplain lakes affected by irregular hydrological conditions the coupling of hydrological factors and other variables contributed 20 32 to the ecological evolution of the lake during different periods the purpose of this study was to provide additional information that can be used to explore lake ecological

1750,in aquatic ecosystems phytoplankton is a key primary producer that is highly sensitive to environmental change understanding ecological succession in lake phytoplankton community structure is important when tracking associated long term environmental response such information can be used to develop a comprehensive management strategy under changing environment this study reconstructs long term 100 year scale phytoplankton community succession from sediment pigments in a typical floodplain lake poyang lake revealing potential lacustrine ecosystem response mechanisms to climate nutrition hydrology factors results show that poyang lake s algal community has undergone rapid growth with diatoms increasing by 9 3 cryptophytes increasing by 8 7 and green algae decreasing by 26 3 in poyang lake the point of change in algal community succession occurred after 1965 representing a 5 15 year delayed response compared to lakes around the world largely due to the coupled effects of the unique hydrological fluctuations and anthropogenic disturbances additionally sediment pigments were also used to accurately track four atypical algal outbreaks in poyang lake i e 1955 1960 1975 1984 and 2003 our results emphasize the importance of hydrological conditions during ecological succession processes in floodplain lakes here coupling effects between water levels and other relevant factors explained 20 32 of algal community variation furthermore results showed that poyang lake had previously evolved under environmental stresses of nutrients and climate conditions while currently evolving under multi source coupling pressure climate nutrient hydrology keywords sediment pigment phytoplankton ecological succession multi source coupling pressure floodplain lake data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rapid economic and social development over the past century has led to pollution climate change and other environmental stressors which have engendered a wide range of impacts on highly sensitive lake ecosystems strongly altering lake primary productivity and phytoplankton community structure heino et al 2021 pacheco et al 2021 birk et al 2020 exploring the mechanisms by which lake ecological succession responds to multiple stressors on a near century scale is critical to developing integrated ecological management strategies hayes et al 2015 phytoplankton pigments preserved in lake sediment faithfully preserve information on the ecological evolution of lakes while also being a commonly used tool to reconstruct lake phytoplankton community succession providing a basis for the comprehensive identification of lake ecosystem response processes under a background of climate change bourel et al 2021 klamt et al 2021 szymczak żyła et al 2016 pigments are widely found in organisms such as algae photosynthetic bacteria macrophytes and terrestrial plants while possessing certain taxonomic properties given that both the content and type of sediment pigments are closely related to the structure and abundance of primary producer communities in recent years sediment pigments have been widely used as biomarkers in the study of ecological community structure klamt et al 2021 deshpande et al 2014 freiberg et al 2011 primary productivity szymczak żyła et al 2011 and nutrient levels montes et al 2021 hofmann et al 2021 in lakes a relatively stable environment is an important prerequisite when using sediment pigments to accurately record lake ecological succession processes the lake environments in these areas are relatively stable and the sediments are in a good state of preservation having avoided any obvious destructive disturbances strong hydrological variability can interfere with the accuracy of palaeolake marsh indicators and there is currently a relative paucity of ecological reconstruction studies using sediment pigments in floodplain lakes with strong hydrological variability our previous study emphasized that for floodplain lakes which are susceptible to seasonal flooding sediment pigments in certain areas still can accurately discern phytoplankton community structure in the overlying water column li et al 2022 this means that sediment pigments can still be used to reconstruct the ecological succession of a floodplain lake under complex hydrological conditions the inversion of lake ecological succession processes through multi proxy palaeolake marsh indicators is essential for the development of lake management strategies through deducing the impact of increased multi source stressors e g anthropogenic activities and climate change on lake ecosystems over the past century for almost a century lake ecosystems around the world have been extensively impacted by multiple stressors while also being threatened by declining water quality and intensive phytoplankton blooms taranu et al 2015 ho et al 2019 birk et al 2020 in particular after the 1950s the coupled effects of climate change and anthropogenic activities have caused abrupt ecological change in lakes globally huang et al 2022 lin et al 2021 alterations caused by anthropogenically derived increases in lake nutrient concentrations e g nitrogen and phosphorus on resident phytoplankton communities are often direct and significant paerl et al 2011 for example anthropogenic dust emissions have caused a 2 3 fold increase in lake phosphorus concentrations in the mountainous region of the southwestern united states of america leading to a 10 fold increase in diatom production brahney et al 2015 moreover global climate change indirectly affects regional lake ecosystems through rising temperatures and alterations in precipitation patterns yang et al 2016 bartosiewicz et al 2019 reported that climate warming can explain 78 of the cyanobacteria biomass change observed in lakes which is the main driving mechanism behind lake ecological succession for floodplain lakes the impact of hydrological changes on the ecology of the lake is perhaps much higher than other climatic factors the risk of water level decline in poyang lake has increased significantly since 2003 due to the declining water level of the yangtze river li et al 2023 however studies considering the impact of hydrological changes on lake ecological succession on long time scale have not been reported indeed whether it is caused by an increase in nutrition loads under anthropogenic activities or a change in the regional environment under climate change impacts caused by these multi source pressures on lake ecosystems do not occur independently many studies have identified complex coupling relationships between multi source pressure that together alter lake systems huang et al 2022 birk et al 2020 for example a study conducted at chaohu lake china confirmed that the multi source coupling pressure that leads to changes in lake ecosystems occasionally occurs asynchronously zhang et al 2019 the coupling of multi source pressure is dependent on the trophic state of lakes especially eutrophic lakes where a significant synergy exists between climatic conditions and nutrients in promoting lake algal communities lin et al 2021 rigosi et al 2014 in addition to the general characteristics of shallow lakes ecological processes of floodplain lakes also respond to changing hydrological conditions e g flow change water level fluctuation etc which affect their ecological stability and biogeochemical cycling rate mcgowan et al 2011 siev et al 2016 as far as floodplain lakes are concerned global climate change and anthropogenic activities have led to fundamental changes in lake hydrological conditions and the role that changing hydrological conditions play in long term ecological lake succession remains unclear wolfe et al 2006 bhattacharya et al 2016 the intent of this study was to explore phytoplankton community succession in a large subtropical floodplain lake over the past century and to reveal the potential response of lake ecological succession processes to coupled multi source pressure i e climate change nutrient inputs and hydrological conditions the general aim of this study was to offer a novel perspective on the long term integrated management of watersheds accordingly this study focused on three specific objectives i to analyze phytoplankton community succession in a floodplain lake over the past century ii to explore the effects of climate change and nutrient inputs on lake phytoplankton community succession iii to understand the driving mechanisms associated with the unique hydrological characteristics of floodplain lakes to the ecological succession of such lakes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area poyang lake 115 49 116 46 e 28 24 29 46 n is located in the middle reache of the yangtze river which is china s largest freshwater lake with a total watershed area of 1 62 105 km2 accounting for 9 of the total yangtze river basin area fig 1 a freshwater inflow into poyang lake mainly derives from five tributaries i e gan river fu river xin river rao river and xiu river and discharges into the yangtze river at the hukou station through a narrow water channel fig 1b yao et al 2015 poyang lake is a typical floodplain lake system wherein its lake area fluctuates between 4000 km2 during the rainy season and 1000 km2 during the dry season song et al 2021 lake water level fluctuated greatly intra annual i e 7 9 m 19 4 m exhibiting hydrological characteristics that have been described as a river in the dry season and a lake in the rainy season liu et al 2015 the region is within a subtropical monsoon climatic zone with an average annual rainfall of 1622 mm the rainy season is from march to september accounting for greater than 80 of the annual rainfall with an average annual temperature of 17 5 c jia et al 2020 poyang lake plays an important role in regulating yangtze river water levels while also protecting its water quality and maintaining its ecological stability liu et al 2017 li et al 2020 indicated that the phytoplankton community in poyang lake is dominated by cyanobacteria based on existing monthly monitoring data it has been shown that the density of phytoplankton has increased by 3 4 times since 2011 xiong et al 2021 in recent decades which has seen the development of the economic zone around poyang lake such as the construction of dams the development of fisheries and the rise of sand mining activities poyang lake s water environment has continuously deteriorated jia et al 2019 overall the water quality of poyang lake is decreasing from 2011 to 2015 and the water quality slightly improves from 2016 to 2019 but eutrophication still exists which has severely threatened the water safety and ecological stability of its surrounding environment xie et al 2022 2 2 sample core collection and screening this study conducted a historical survey of poyang lake at sites where sample cores were collected this was combined with information collected from local residents to ensure that no significant anthropogenic disturbances e g sand mining and river dredging had historically occurred around the sample cores thus ensuring that physicochemical sediment indicators were fully representative of the overlying water column in april 2021 we selected 14 alternative sediment sampling sites s1 s14 that were evenly distributed across the lake area where 40 cm sediment sample cores were collected using the chinese manufactured xdb0205 gravity column sediment sampler 5 5 mm inner diameter fig 1b samples were immediately separated at 1 cm intervals and then placed in opaque self sealing bags after freezing 20 c they were transported to the institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research chinese academy of sciences igsnrr cas all samples were weighed before and after lyophilization 48 h 0 1 pa to calculate moisture content and then processed for subsequent analysis it is important to note that unlike typical shallow lakes sediment pigments in floodplain lakes tend to be poorly preserved this made it necessary to screen the 14 sample cores and select those with well preserved pigment information for lake algae reconstruction li et al 2022 through a comparative analysis of the surface pigments of the 14 alternative sediment cores we first ascertained that there was a serious loss in pigment information at all sampling points except s8 consequently losing its significance as a lake ecology proxy index fig s1 in this study s8 28 996 n 116 336 e with the highest pigment concentration and the richest pigment species was therefore selected as the sampling site for the ecological reconstruction of poyang lake s phytoplankton community fig 1c 2 3 laboratory analyses 2 3 1 sediment chronology lyophilized and sieved sediment samples were evenly added to 7 ml centrifuge tubes 5 7 g sample and compacted to add more samples to improve measurement accuracy samples were then sealed in a sealing film and left for 3 4 weeks after which they were transported to beijing normal university where the samples were measured for excess lead 210 210pbex and cesium 137 137cs activity using a high purity germanium γ energy spectrometer ortec usa and a gwl 120 15 well type high purity germanium probe with a dspec jr 2 0 multi channel digital spectrometer the sample measurement time was set to 80000 s pedrosa garcia et al 2020 the 210pbex chronology was calculated according to the constant rate of supply crs model using the following equation krishnaswamy et al 1971 a a 0 e λ t where a0 is the total 210pbex input bq cm 2 in the sediment cores a is the cumulative 210pbex input bq cm 2 in the sediment cores at depth m and below λ is the decay constant of 210pbex 0 03114 a 1 t is the age of each sediment layer the maximum 137cs activity value was used as the timescale to determine 1963 2 3 2 sediment geochemical and pigment analysis the total carbon tc concentration in sediment was determined using an elemental carbon nitrogen analyzer vario max n cn elemantar germany the total nitrogen tn concentration in sediment was obtained using a digestion method and then determined using flow injection analysis allance organic matter om was determined using the loss on ignition loi method 550 c ignition temperature for 2 h through quality differences before and after sediment om calculations beaudoin 2003 the lyophilized samples were ground to a powder using a mortar and pestle under dark conditions approximately 1 g of the sample was weighed in a 10 ml glass centrifuge tube ptfe spacer wrapped in tin foil to prevent light exposure and 6 ml of an extraction reagent 80 hplc acetone 15 methanol 5 water was then added the samples were centrifuged for 10 min 2500 rpm min after which the supernatant was aspirated with a syringe and filtered through a ptfe membrane 0 22 μm hydrophobic into a 10 ml brown colored sample bottle ptfe spacer blown dry with nitrogen and stored under frozen conditions blow dried samples were rehydrated with 800 μl of the reagent 70 hplc acetone 25 ipr 5 methanol transferred to 2 ml brown colored sample bottles and mechanically analyzed sediment pigments were analyzed using an agilent technologies high performance liquid chromatography 1260 series with a quaternary pump an auto sampler

by chen et al 2001 the collected sample core pigment was identified and quantitatively analyzed by comparing the maximum absorption wavelength 440 nm 620 nm retention time and peak area at characteristic wavelength with the danish hydraulic institute dhi pigment standards and expressed as nmol g organic matter om 2 4 data source historical poyang lake tn and total phosphorus tp concentration measurements were obtained from ma et al 2021 while historical water level data were obtained from the xingzi hydrological station fig 2 b historical precipitation data of the poyang lake basin were obtained from the national tibetan plateau data center https data tpdc ac cn the monthly precipitation dataset of china at a 1 km resolution peng 2020 and historical temperature data at a 1 km resolution were obtained from the a big earth data platform for three poles https poles tpdc ac cn peng 2019 both datasets have a spatial resolution of 0 0083333 1 km and both span the period between 1901 and 2020 additionally both datasets were generated from the global 0 5 climate dataset published by the climate research unit cru and the global high resolution climate dataset published by worldclim https www worldclim org we used the delta spatial downscaling process to downscale the chinese region both datasets were validated using data from 496 meteorological observation points and results were verified to be credible using modelbuilder in arcgis monthly precipitation and temperature raster data were extracted in batches data were then cropped according to the study area and combined and counted to obtain the annual average precipitation and the annual average temperature of the poyang lake basin because precipitation data from 1996 was missing corresponding precipitation data from 1995 and 1997 were averaged and then used for 1996 3 results 3 1 establishing the chronological sequence of sediment and associated sedimentation rate characteristics as shown in fig 2a the specific activity of 210pbex vertically sectioned tended to decrease with depth where upper core section 0 12 cm values were much higher compared to lower section core 12 40 cm values the average specific activity of 210pbex in the upper core section was 258 59 bq kg 1 with a maximum value of 363 25 bq kg 1 at the surface 6 cm the average specific activity of 210pbex in the lower core section was 31 24 bq kg 1 with a minimum value of 9 39 bq kg 1 at the bottom of the core i e 34 cm the average specific activity of 137cs in the core section was 4 32 bq kg 1 with a peak of 10 72 bq kg 1 at 34 cm and a secondary peak of 4 96 bq kg 1 at a 6 cm depth from the sediment surface based on the data from the specific activity of 210pbex a chronology of 40 cm sample cores was constructed using the crs model in combination with linear interpolation and the sediment mass accumulation rate mar was then calculated fig 2b the bottom 40 cm of poyang lake column cores corresponded to 1898 combined with the 137cs profile distribution 34 cm corresponded to 1963 however it did not match the 1963 values obtained from crs model calculations at approx 26 cm cs is an alkali metal most of its salt is soluble and its potential for upward and downward migration is high following deposition gao et al 2021 unlike cs the salt solubility of pb is extremely low it does not easily migrate upwards or downwards through interstitial water while it can stably exist in sediment therefore when the two radionuclides yield an obvious date difference dating will be based on 210pbex the mar exhibited a general increasing and subsequent decreasing trend with an average mar value of 0 17 g cm 2 yr 1 from 1959 to 1993 the mar value of poyang lake was significantly higher than other periods p 0 05 reaching a historical peak 0 39 g cm 2 yr 1 at around 1963 since the 1990s the mar value of poyang lake has gradually decreased and has maintained an average of approximately 0 10 g cm 2 yr 1 3 2 distribution characteristics of sediment geophysical and chemical index profiles trends in water content om tc and tn concentrations in sediment sample cores were basically the same all abruptly increasing at around the 1980s and reaching a peak at around 2000 fig 3 the average om content in surface sediment 0 10 cm was 18 33 which was much higher than the average om content in the intermediate and lower layers 5 64 trends in tc and tn concentrations in sediment sample cores were basically consistent with average concentrations of 25 17 mg kg 1 and 2 20 mg kg 1 respectively both exhibiting an annual increasing trend between 1984 and 2008 7 19 cm the c n trend was generally characterized by an increase and subsequent decrease peaking at 26 52 in 1946 31 cm followed by 17 93 in 1959 28 cm the mean c n for the remaining period was 11 36 whose range varied between 9 61 and 13 94 for which the sediment surface 1 cm yielded the lowest value the changing trend in the volumetric weight of sediment was opposite to that of other indicators increasing in the first 20 cm before being maintained at 1 27 g cm 3 with an increase in sediment depth the permeability coefficient decreased under compaction while the volumetric weight of sediment increased volumetric weight distribution characteristics in sediment core profiles substantiated poyang lake s good sediment compaction and bottom sediment stability 3 3 historical changes in climate nutrient and hydrologic conditions in poyang lake in poyang lake the precipitation trend over the past century 1901 2017 was a general decreasing fluctuation at a mean annual precipitation rate of 1497 96 mm fig 4 a the low point in precipitation occurred at around 1925 where the average annual precipitation remained below 1320 mm for five consecutive years and where the average precipitation was only 1165 44 mm additionally two periods of extremely high precipitation occurred in 1949 and 1954 with precipitation rates of 1961 40 mm and 2126 88 mm respectively contrary to mean annual precipitation the trend in mean annual temperature was characterized by a general increasing fluctuation i e 0 01 c annually moreover poyang lake s average annual temperature increased by approximately 1 3 c during this 100 year period fig 4b generally poyang lake had three distinct periods in annual average temperature change the first period was from 1901 to 1948 where temperatures fluctuated and continued to increase during this period the temperature of poyang lake began to increase rapidly from 16 96 c in 1901 at an increasing rate of 0 02 c per year reaching its current level of 18 18 c in 1948 the second period was from 1949 to 1993 where the temperature of poyang lake gradually stabilized and was basically maintained at approximately 17 64 c the third period was after 1994 when annual average temperatures began to gradually increase once again this final increase rate in temperature was comparatively lower than the first stage but its average temperature was as high as 18 27 c therefore the third period from 1994 onwards yielded the highest recorded temperature in poyang lake over the past century the average tn concentration in poyang lake was 1 26 mg l 1 exhibiting an overall increasing trend especially in 2017 and 2018 when the tn concentration was 2 12 mg l 1 and 3 42 mg l 1 respectively namely a respective increase in magnitude of 1 7 and 2 7 the average tp concentration was 0 19 mg l 1 reaching a historical peak 0 63 mg l 1 at around 2004 since then tp concentrations have exhibited a fluctuating downward trend with tp concentrations increasing once again to 0 40 mg l 1 in 2018 over the past 60 years poyang lake s average water level was 13 34 m however there was a significant decrease in its water level after the completion of the three gorges dam at its lowest point the water level decreased by 0 49 m the average water level was lower than 1 10 m at its highest the water level decreased by 1 11 m after the completion of the three gorges dam fig 4d 3 4 distribution of poyang lake sediment pigment profiles this study s sediment pigment analysis accurately traced the evolution of phytoplankton communities and associated productivity within a large shallow lake over the past century fig 5 in total 11 pigments were identified in poyang lake sediment generally sediment pigment concentrations gradually decreased with increasing depth where there were significant concentration differences among the different pigments p 0 05 for example alloxanthin from cryptophytes was mainly distributed in upper sediment layers 0 13 cm with an average concentration of 4 29 nmol g 1 om the lowest canthaxanthin concentration from cyanobacteria was detected in sample cores averaging only 0 88 nmol g 1 om however pigment was widely distributed within sediment where 0 23 nmol g 1 om was also detected in the lowest section of the sample cores chlorophyll b chl b was used along with its degradation products deg chl b including pheophytin b and pheophytin b to indicate past chlorophyte dynamics in the lake their concentrations followed a consistent trend in sediment with mean concentrations of 4 93 nmol g 1 om 97 67 nmol g 1 om and 78 50 nmol g 1 om chlorophyll a chl a and its degradation products deg chl a including pheophytin a and pheophytin a were indicative of the lake s total algal community and productivity levels which widely present in sediment at an average concentration of 23 26 nmol g 1 om 4 discussion 4 1 successional characteristics of phytoplankton communities over the past century coniss cluster analysis of pigment assemblages showed that the most significant changes in algal communities occurred in 1959 and 1992 fig 6 a our corresponding non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis tracked three stratigraphic sediment pigment concentration assemblages in poyang lake fig 6b phytoplankton succession in the lake over the last century was divided into three distinct periods based on changes in stratigraphic sediment pigment concentrations period i 1898 1958 period ii 1959 1991 and period iii 1992 to present the lower sediment pigment concentration during period i indicated that phytoplankton biomass and productivity was low in poyang lake during this period period ii showed an increasing fluctuation trend in sediment pigment concentrations during this period a peak pigment concentration was detected in 1969 indicative of an atypical proliferation of the lake algae community since 1992 the pigment concentration reached its highest level in recorded history where the pigment concentration was greater by a magnitude of 2 35 compared to that of the previous period indicating a significant increase in poyang lake phytoplankton biomass and productivity based on pigment concentration characteristics from different phytoplankton we calculated their individual share of the total pigment which is a technique often used to reflect changes in phytoplankton biomass over time zhang et al 2019 fig 7 our study showed that phytoplankton community structure in the poyang lake basin has changed significantly over the past century according to coniss classification fig 6a and the sediment pigment percentage map fig 7 phytoplankton community succession in poyang lake over the past century can be broadly classified into three distinct stages namely the stable period period i the fluctuation period period ii and the ensuing stable period period iii chlorophytes and cyanobacteria taxa were the most dominant phytoplankton communities in poyang lake which consistently accounted for greater than 50 of the overall phytoplankton community during our previous field monitoring campaign li et al 2020 we determined that cyanobacteria are currently the dominant phytoplankton species in poyang lake followed by chlorophytes which is consistent with the findings of this study during the fluctuation period period ii 1959 1991 the structure of the various phytoplankton communities changed dramatically mainly with respect to a significant decline in chlorophyte community biomass and a significant increase in diatom biomass from the fluctuation period to the ensuing stable period period iii 1992 to present the proportion of diatom biomass in poyang lake increased from approximately 22 0 to 31 3 and the proportion of cryptophyte biomass rapidly increased from 1 1 to 9 8 namely an increase of nearly 10 fold while chlorophyte biomass decreased from 43 1 to 16 8 by 1992 during the ensuing stable period poyang lake s phytoplankton community structure regained relative stability it is worth noting that total algal biomass during this period was much higher than that of the other two periods this was because the concentration of each pigment detected in sediment during the ensuing stable period was much higher than that detected during the other two periods it was determined that the trend in diatom biomass throughout poyang lake s historical period was roughly opposite to that of cyanobacteria biomass specifically cyanobacteria biomass was more abundant during periods of low diatom biomass in general diatoms explosive growth transferred nutrients from lake water to sediment making them unavailable for use by other algae species therefore cyanobacteria are more abundant during years when diatoms are sparse barker et al 2012 sediment pigment signals can be used to accurately infer atypical increases in lake algae providing a new means of monitoring lake ecology lake sediment pigments provide specific information on the evolution of algal communities and have been shown to be a reliable proxy in past eutrophication studies schneider et al 2018 cook et al 2016 pigment sample core distribution clearly showed signals of past algal blooms in the lake where algae accounted for greater than 80 of such events particularly cyanobacteria and chlorophytes since the 1950s atypical cyanobacteria and chlorophyte growth has often occurred in poyang lake and sediment pigment analysis was able to clearly trace four distinct algae bloom signals i e approx 1955 1960 1975 1984 and 2003 a previous survey showed that between 1955 and 1964 the forest cover surrounding the poyang lake basin decreased by 37 3 where soil erosion was severe by the mid 1960s the area of soil erosion surrounding the poyang lake basin reached 1 8 million hm2 hu 2001 such a large amount of soil organic matter promoted an increase in aquatic nutrient levels creating the conditions for the algal blooms detected at around 1960 qian et al 2016 found that cyanobacteria proliferated in poyang lake in 2007 which corresponds to an increase in cyanobacteria pigments that our study detected in sediment at around 2003 unlike the cyanobacteria and chlorophyte blooms in poyang lake the yangtze estuary situated within the same climatic zone is dominated by diatom and dinoflagellate blooms fang et al 2022 being a floodplain lake type poyang lake is susceptible to nutrient inputs and strong hydrodynamic conditions under eutrophic and well mixed water conditions cyanobacteria and chlorophyte compete better than diatoms under low light and turbid conditions thus cyanobacteria and chlorophytes always dominate algal bloom outbreaks in poyang lake zhang et al 2020 although poyang lake s algae community has generally changed significantly over the past century the succession process of different algae taxa remains unclear the point of rapid change in poyang lake s algal community mainly occurred after 1965 fig 8 representing a 5 15 year delayed response compared to similar lakes around the world steffen et al 2015 maheaux et al 2016 jane et al 2021 furthermore different algae taxa differed asynchronously in their ecological succession process for example the chlorophyte community initially changed in 1965 while the diatom community initially changed in 1967 during period ii i e fluctuation period 1959 1991 cyanobacteria experienced two periods of change i e 1981 and 1985 however the short interval between these two periods may in actual fact be the starting and ending point corresponding to the atypical growth of cyanobacteria biomass in 1984 since the mid 1980s nitrogen and phosphorus nutrient inputs into poyang lake have dramatically increased fig 3 which has promoted cyanobacteria community growth over an extended period i e 25 years 1985 2010 temporal changes in global lake ecosystems are typically asynchronous where ecological changes in lakes with a high human footprint e g lower and mid latitudinal lakes that feed the yangtze river occur later compared to lakes with a low human footprint e g alpine and arctic lakes huang et al 2022 this study extends the debate on lake ecological change specifically it shows that successional changes in different algal communities within a single lake biome are also asynchronous and this is dependent upon the response sensitivity of different algal taxa to environment stress 4 2 driving mechanisms of ecological succession in a floodplain lake over the past century the ecological succession which has taken place in freshwater ecosystems throughout the world over the past century can be explained by multi source environmental pressure i e climate change anthropogenic activity and pollution birk et al 2020 jenny et al 2020 at an intermediate to long term scale there has been a change in the factors that dominate lake ecosystem succession from single intense and well characterized stressors e g point source pollution to multi source coupled and complex stressors schäfer et al 2016 richardson et al 2018 however multi source stressors that impact lake ecosystems are ambiguous for lakes within temperate and subtropical regions where multi source stressors tend to mask one another rühland et al 2008 according to our research multi source pressure on lakes can be distinctly separated into four groups namely nutrition wtn wtp stn and stc climate precipitation and temperature hydrology wl and sediment transport mar fig 9 a the nutrient group is the main explanatory variable of axis constraint 1 accounting for 47 04 of algae community change while the climate hydrology and sediment transport groups are the main explanatory variables of axis constraint 2 5 41 our study emphasizes that nutrients are the main stressors that drive algal succession in the poyang lake basin this is because they possess the strongest explanatory power for algal community change on the ordination axis and primarily show a positive facilitative effect when accounting for the multi source pressure model secondary stressors can alleviate nutrient input stress however most lakes lack effective secondary stressors i e morphological changes heat stress hydrology etc thus the response of nutritional stress is typically stronger jeppesen et al 2005 nõges et al 2016 the geophysical and chemical data obtained from the lake cores indicated that nutrient inputs into poyang lake are currently increasing moreover the continuance of high flux inputs from this major stressor will significantly accelerate algal community succession over an extended period climate and hydrology have a negative influence on lake algal community succession moreover climate plays a weaker role than nutrients in long term lake ecological succession processes unlike lakes in other regions of the world this study highlights the fact that climate change does not appear to have a predictable and obvious impact on lake algae at least on a century scale yang et al 2016 deng et al 2018 gangi et al 2020 this is mainly due to poyang lake s relatively stable climate fig 4a and b therefore climate did not effectively impact its lake ecosystem additionally climate fluctuation is time averaged which requires further succession process subdivisions during the study period for floodplain lakes that undergo high hydrological fluctuations water level is a key controlling regulator of lake trophic status phytoplankton growth and gpp wu et al 2019 specifically periods of low water levels concentrate the available nutrient content that subsequently drive community based algal blooms wang et al 2021 lake ecological successional response to multi source pressure is both temporally and spatially uneven perga et al 2015 poyang lake s early stage period i 1898 1958 and current stage period iii 1992 to present developed well along axis constraint 2 while the intermediate stage period ii 1959 1991 developed mainly along axis constraint 1 this shows that the importance of stressors is dependent on the specific lake development stage over the past century poyang lake s dominant stressors evolved from climate to nutrient factors ultimately evolving to its current state i e a climate hydrology stressor type lake the alternating effects of climate change hydrological conditions and nutrient inputs on lake ecological succession depend upon its nutritional status lin et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 continuous nutrient inputs during the early stage of the lake lifted algae growth restrictions which led to the dominance of nutritional pressure however the continuance of nutrient inputs is no longer able to significantly alter the algae structure of the lake currently climate hydrology interventions have turned the lake into a climate hydrology pressure dominant type at a global scale climatic effects largely dominated lake succession prior to the 1950 s while nutrient inputs and pollution have often driven changes after 1950 huang et al 2022 jia et al 2022 although the abrupt ecological changing pattern of floodplain lakes is consistent with that of global lakes the mode of this abrupt change lags by approximately 10 years variance partitioning analysis vpa was used to measure multi source synergistic stress contributions to algal community succession over three distinct periods fig 9b c and d obvious and complex coupling effects were detected among multi source pressure factors and this effect was temporally asynchronous for floodplain lakes sediment transport can be seen as a parameter how the lake is affected by upstream sediment transport i e a potential indicator of exogenous nutrient transport in the intermediate period of the lake period ii nutrient source pressure including endogenous and exogenous factors coupled with other factors collectively explained 31 of algal community structure exogenous nutrient inputs alone explained 17 which roughly corresponded to the nutrient inputs caused by soil erosion during the mid twentieth century hu 2001 compared to period ii multi source stressors during period iii were more tightly coupled and complex and therefore more difficult to interpret climate trophic hydrological synergy had even strengthened especially climate trophic synergy which together explained 30 of phytoplankton community variation even though it was earlier stated that climate change had no obvious effect on lake succession on a one hundred year scale the effect of climate change has been very strong over the past 30 years this is due to an increase in poyang lake mat after 1992 which was considerably higher than the average increase over the past century increasing temperatures may affect both phytoplankton productivity and community by improving the stability and stratification of the water column especially in shallow eutrophic lakes wu et al 2018 janatian et al 2020 water level fluctuation is a key characteristic of floodplain lakes results from this study emphasize the key role that water level plays in long term lake succession processes during period ii and period iii coupling pressure between hydrology and other variables explained differences in algal communities i e by 20 and 32 respectively in floodplain lakes water level is the key hydrological connectivity index promoting exchanges in water sediment nutrients and organisms between upstream and downstream reaches keruzoré et al 2013 shi et al 2017 changes in water levels will result in changes in seasonal velocity and submerged areas which will strongly impact algal communities castillo 2020 after the three gorges dam was built 2003 poyang lake s water levels decreased by 1 1 m on average which to a certain extent affected its hydrological material exchange with the yangtze river while stagnant nutrient concentrations promoted algal growth in the lake additionally horizontal dragging and exchange of algae caused by high water levels during flood events may directly determine the algal community structure zalocar de domitrovic 2003 we believe that when explaining lake ecological pressure a hydrological dimension should be included based on conventional multi source climate nutrition coupling pressure which together constitute multi source climate nutrition hydrology coupling pressure 5 conclusions in this study four atypical algae outbreaks in poyang lake were accurately tracked using sediment pigments algal community succession was mainly characterized by a significant increase in total algal biomass where diatom and cryptophyte biomass increased and chlorophyte biomass decreased in poyang lake the point of change in algal community succession occurred after 1965 representing a 5 15 year delayed response compared to similar lakes around the world over the past century poyang lake s main stressors have evolved from climate and nutrient factors to the climatic hydrological stressors seen today this ecological succession pattern is consistent with lakes throughout the world with a temporal lag of approximately 10 years additionally we also believe that the influence of hydrological conditions on lake ecology cannot be ignored especially for floodplain lakes affected by irregular hydrological conditions the coupling of hydrological factors and other variables contributed 20 32 to the ecological evolution of the lake during different periods the purpose of this study was to provide additional information that can be used to explore lake ecological

1751,an energy balance model run on a monthly time step for 800 years was developed to predict the future level areal extent and temperature of the dead sea under different scenarios of freshwater input and atmospheric boundary conditions the model integrates energy water and salt balances the bathymetry of the dead sea was derived from high resolution digital elevation data model results were verified against measured lake level for the period 1928 through 2022 predicted levels are very close to observed values as demonstrated by three statistical measures the monthly temperatures of the mixed layer as predicted by the model were also commensurate with observational results and satellite derived data future simulation predictions were verified against a novel diagnostic analytic method developed in this investigation the newly developed method has the potential to approximate the equilibrium activity and temperature of hypersaline lakes under specified freshwater inflow and atmospheric forcings results show that the future level areal extent and temperature of the dead sea will be contingent on freshwater inflow and the prevailing atmospheric forcings projections indicate that the dead sea will end up as a dwarfed hypersaline hot lake the time span needed for the dead sea to reach a quasi steady state equilibrium is several hundred years simulations results presented in this investigation are expected to be approximate given the complexity of the system the long integration time involved and uncertainties brought about by climate vagaries and model parameterizations keywords dead sea future fate hypersaline lakes modeling diagnostic procedures water balance equilibrium activity and temperature data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the dead sea is a hypersaline endorheic lake situated in the deepest part of the jordan rift valley being a closed lake the dead sea level fluctuations and the deep sediment records have extensively been used to reconstruct paleoclimate during the holocene and earlier geological epochs for the levant klein and flohn 1987 bookman et al 2004 bookman et al 2006 neugebauer 2015 müller et al 2022 sediment records were used to investigate hydroclimate and vegetations patterns at the desert fringe in relation to past and future climate dynamics stein and goldstein 2020 sharp climate transitions from pluvial to dry conditions and vice versa were observed during the holocene and these climate shifts were characterized by significant changes in human culture issar 1995 green 2004 kagan et al 2015 the level fluctuations of the dead sea were implemented by numerous investigators to deduce precipitation in the levant during the late holocene e g enzel et al 2003 morin et al 2018 for instance morin et al 2018 used a stochastic framework to generate ensemble of precipitation estimates to reconstruct precipitation in the late holocene in the levant based on lake level fluctuations as derived by bookman et al 2004 there is no evidence that the dead sea disappeared in the past several thousand years and that its level was fluctuating between 392 and 415 m below mean sea level bsl e g bookman et al 2004 2006 during the late holocene the areal extent of the lake was confined to the deep northern basin for most of the time see also morin et al 2018 the substantial imbalance in recent years between freshwater input on the one hand and natural evaporation and brine withdrawal for industrial activities on the other resulted in a large level drop and areal shrinkage leading to significant alteration to the chemical composition of the lake metzger et al 2018 vey et al 2021 the brine specific gravity increased from 1 175 prior to 1960 to a current value of 1 24 likewise its activity declined from 0 78 prior to 1960 to a current value of 0 65 e g zilberman et al 2017 lensky et al 2018 vey et al 2021 there has been a real concern that the dead sea will dry up in the future given its very large negative water budget during the past several decades numerous investigators examined the future level and areal extent of the dead sea using a variety of methods e g empirical equations e g anati and shasha 1990 gavrieli et al 1989 stanhill 1994 harza jrv group 1996 yechieli et al 1998 al weshah 2000 the relative humidity concept krumgalz et al 2000 zilberman et al 2017 and water balance calculations e g asmar and ergenzinger 2002a b c results obtained varied widely for instance klein 1990 using the analogy of a single year water budget concluded that the dead sea would reach a state of equilibrium when its level reaches 680 m bsl with an area of 300 km2 krumgalz et al 2000 used the pitzer thermodynamic approach to calculate the ultimate equilibrium activity of the dead sea that is when water loss by evaporation is balanced by condensation from the adjacent atmosphere they concluded that a state of equilibrium will be attained when the activity coefficient of the dead sea brine reaches around 50 this activity corresponds to a surface level of about 510 m bsl and a surface area of 526 km2 calculations presented by krumgalz et al were based on isothermal evaporation and assumed no freshwater input or withdrawal from the lake thus thermodynamic feedback mechanisms and other water balance components which have significant impacts on the dead sea water budget were not taken into account see oroud 2019a using a water balance approach asmar and ergenzinger 2002b c projected that the dead sea will continue dropping for the following 500 years authors did not specify a final level to the dead sea zilberman et al 2017 discussed the future fate of the dead sea based on field observations and relative humidity concepts and concluded that the lake will reach an equilibrium when its activity is lower than that proposed by krumgalz et al 2000 these wide variations in the prediction of lake level and its areal extent reflect the complexity of the problem and the high level of uncertainty in the estimates the above projections become irreconcilable when taking into account uncertainties in freshwater input industrial activities climate change scenarios and the nonlinear thermodynamic feedback the present investigation revisits the future fate of the dead sea using a physically based model which takes into account freshwater input brine withdrawal for industrial purposes and the projected global warming an analytic procedure is developed in this paper to examine the simulation results 2 study area the dead sea is an endorheic hypersaline lake situated in a pull apart tectonic depression occupying the lowest continental land on the earth surface frumkin and raz 2001 the catchment area of the dead sea is 40000 km2 which spans climatic conditions ranging from hyper arid in the southern parts to sub humid mediterranean in the northern reach of the catchment fig 1 shows the location of the dead sea along with the nearby adjacent areas fig 1 also shows the spatial retreat of the lake during the past 60 years the climatic conditions prevailing over the lake are hyper arid and average annual precipitation over the surface of the lake is 70 mm potential evaporation in this deep gorge is in excess of 2600 mm year e g oroud 2020 being very hypersaline the dead sea water loss by evaporation is less than one half of potential evaporation oroud 2001a oroud 2011 metzger et al 2018 vey et al 2021 the air temperature is quite high with an average of 34 oc in july and august and 17 oc in january 3 recent changes to the dead sea until the end of the first half of the twentieth century the water level of the dead sea was quasi stationary with small fluctuations that reflected the inter annual variability of surface runoff from its large but relatively arid catchment area long term average runoff from its catchment area prior to 1960 was 35 40 mm a 1 giving an average annual flow of 1400 1500 106 m3 a 1 e g siebert et al 2014 during that period the jordan river supplied more than two third of water inflow to the lake siebert et al 2014 the diversion of the jordan river and the constructions of numerous water dams on side wadies along with the aridification trend in the eastern mediterranean in recent years have exacerbated the water budget of the dead sea e g kelley et al 2015 cook et al 2016 the significant anthropogenic interventions reduced the volume of freshwater reaching the lake by more than 75 80 compared to historical times e g lensky et al 2005 oroud 2011 siebert et al 2014 the water budget of the dead sea is strongly influenced by the commercial facilities at its southern corner where large quantities of brine are withdrawn for potash production and other byproducts the average annual brine withdrawal from the dead sea has been 550 million m3 around 45 50 of which returns to the lake as highly concentrated end brine siebert et al 2014 zilberman et al 2017 the arab potash company 2021 apc as a result of these large scale anthropogenic interventions the lake level has been declining steadily and its level dropped down from 392 m bsl prior to 1960 neumann 1958 gertman and hecht 2002 to 436 m bsl at the end of 2022 apc 2022 likewise the area of the dead sea shrank from around 950 km2 prior to 1960 to a current value as of august 2021 of 600 km2 a shrinkage of about 40 fig 1 fig 2 displays the dead sea level changes from1928 through 2021 apc 2021 4 method of investigation a variety of methods were employed in this investigation to derive the water balance of the dead sea and its areal extent detailed discussions of the energy budget mass and salt balances are presented below 4 1 water balance the water mass balance of the dead sea may be written in the following form e g oroud 1997 lensky et al 2005 akridge 2008 δ m δ t ro suf wb rb a p e 1 where δm δt is the mass change with respect to time m t 1 ro suf wb and rb are runoff subsurface flow brine withdrawal and return flow m t 1 a is the surface area of the lake l2 p and e are precipitation and evaporation l t 1 respectively evaporation from a saline solution is a complex function of salinity activity coefficient and meteorological forcings which may be expressed in the following form e g turk 1970 oroud 2001a b mor et al 2018 e f β ф 2 where e is evaporation β is the activity coefficient and ф is the meteorological forcing e g net radiation air temperature wind speed ambient vapor pressure atmospheric stability atmospheric pressure the activity coefficient defined as the ratio of saturation water vapor pressure over a saline solution to that over freshwater at the same temperature may be expressed in the following form e g oroud 2020 β e s t i s i e s t i 3 where β is the activity coefficient si is salinity specific gravity of the saline solution and ti is its surface temperature the activity for a saline solution depends on the concentration of dissolved salts and their ionic strength e g dickson et al 1965 turk 1970 calder and neal 1984 folchitto 1991 this coefficient varies from values close to 0 97 for the open oceans to less than 0 20 for very hypersaline solutions similar to those in sinkholes along the retreating dead sea shoreline zilberman et al 2017 evaporation from a lake surface may be estimated using a variety of methods e g a dalton type equation eddy covariance method bowen ratio and the penman method metzger et al 2018 hamdani et al 2018 lensky et al 2018 mor et al 2018 oroud 2019b 2020 in this paper evaporation from the dead sea is calculated using the modified penman equation as it combines the energy balance and aerodynamic terms e g calder and neal 1984 e β δ r n β δ ψ ψ f u β e s e a β δ ψ 4 where e is latent heat flux w m 2 β is the activity coefficient of the saline water body δ is the slope of saturation water vapor pressure calculated by ew es tw ta where ei and ti refer to vapor pressure and temperature of water and ambient air respectively rn is net radiation ψ is the psychrometric constant cp p 0 622λe where cp is the specific heat of air at constant pressure p is atmospheric pressure and λe is latent heat of vaporization j kg 1 the wind function wm 2hpa 1 is evaluated based on previous evaporation studies from the dead sea hamdani et al 2018 f u 2 7 3 4 u 5 where u is wind speed m s 1 at 2 m above the surface the wind function represents mass transfer caused by mechanical and gravitational forces e g brutsaert 1982 finch and gash 2002 foken 2008 4 2 energy balance the energy balance wm 2 of a water surface may be expressed using the following form oroud 2020 rn s 1 α l l 6 where s is solar radiation and α is surface albedo taken for the water body as 0 05 l and l are incoming and outgoing longwave radiation atmospheric radiation is calculated using an expression presented by brutsaert 1982 l εa σta 4 1 ω cc ς 7 where εa is clear sky atmospheric emissivity σ is the steffan boltzmann constant 5 667 10 8 w m 2 k 4 cc is cloud cover fraction ω and ς are correction terms for cloud contribution see oroud and nasrallah 1998 atmospheric emissivity is calculated using the procedure presented by brutsaert 1982 8 ε a 1 24 e a ta 273 15 1 7 where ea is the ambient water vapor pressure hpa at 2 m upwelling radiation is calculated using the following expression l εw σtw 4 9 where εw is surface emissivity of water 0 97 tw is water temperature k in this formulation change in heat storage is neglected because this term will be close to zero for a long integration time 4 3 salinity and density calculations the salt balance in the dead sea is a complex function of natural forcings and man made activities large quantities of brine are withdrawn from the dead sea for potash production and other byproducts around 550 million m3 of brine is withdrawn annually of which around 250 280 million m3 of highly saline brine is returned to the dead sea as reject brine apc 2021 the salinity and specific gravity of reject brine is 450 gl 1 and 1 34 respectively zilberman et al 2017 these processes along with brine concentration resulting from the large amount of evaporation have to be included in the calculation of the salt balance of the dead sea assuming a uniform distribution of salinity across the dead sea the salt balance for a unit area can be calculated using the following approximations lensky et al 2005 m t m w m s 10 ms si mt 11 where mt is the total mass of the column mw is the mass of water ms and si are the mass of salt and brine salinity the change in salt mass for the dead sea is a function of incoming salt contributed from surface runoff and underground recharge s i n withdrawn brine s i w b for potash production and reject brine s r r b flowing back from the concentration ponds and salt precipitation sp respectively 12 δ m s s i n s r r b s i w w s p the overall change in salinity is also influenced by the change in the mass balance δ m t of the dead sea resulting from mass inflow and that lost by evaporation expressed as 13 δ m t p ρ i n r i n ρ r b r r b s p ρ d s w b e where p ρin rin ρ r r r b ρ d s w b e are mass of precipitation incoming flow reject brine withdrawn brine and evaporation respectively the new salinity of the dead sea after a given time step may be calculated using the following form 14 s i n m s δ m s m t δ m t as indicated by numerous investigators e g gavrieli et al 1989 sirota et al 2016 the dead sea column is slightly oversaturated year around below the mixing layer below 20 25 m while the surface layer experiences a seasonal cycle alternating from over saturation in winter and undersaturation during the hot summer months when the surface temperature increases appreciably using high resolution temperature profiling arnon et al 2014 2016 observed double diffusion salt fingering across the transitional zone between the mixed surface layer and the deep layer in summer this double diffusion is responsible for the prevalence of undersaturation of the mixed layer in summer despite the high evaporation rates during this period precipitation of halite was observed in the deep layers whereas halite crystallization and its subsequent dissolution occurs in shallow areas of the dead sea during the course of year sirota et al 2016 2021 complicating significantly the calculations of salt balance of the dead sea measurements by lensky et al 2005 during the winter months when the lake becomes fully mixed indicated that 0 1 m of halite is precipitated at the lake bottom per year and that the density of brine increases by 0 24 kg m 3 each year thus salt balance calculations are approximate in nature given the many uncertainties of processes influencing salt mass balance such as the contribution of subsurface flow evaporation crystallization and dissolution within the deep and shallow layers in the dead sea salt precipitated at the lake bottom as obtained from the work of lensky et al 2005a is taken into account in the calculation of salt mass balance in this paper the activity coefficient is strongly linked to brine density as demonstrated by zilberman et al 2017 in this investigation the activity is calculated based on a polynomial formula presented by asmar and ergenzinger 2002 based on data presented by oroud 1994 1995 15 β 30 285 77 65 ρ 62 712 ρ 2 16 3 ρ 3 where β is the activity coefficient and ρ is the specific gravity of the saline water 4 4 water temperature in this investigation the dead sea column was broken down into two layers a surface layer at the top with a virtual depth of 15 m and the deep column which extends from the bottom of the surface layer to the bottom of the sea the top layer will float over the deeper layer as long as density of the former is lower than the deeper one mixing between the two layers occurs when the density of the top layer becomes similar or larger than the deeper one the density of the top layer is a function of salt flux and thermal expansion caused by heating from solar radiation sirota et al 2016 the water temperature is calculated based on the concept of the equilibrium temperature e g sweers 1976 the equilibrium temperature is defined as that at which the sum of energy fluxes across the surface atmosphere boundary vanishes e g finch and gash 2002 it was shown that the concept of the equilibrium temperature can be applied successfully to evaluate temperature and evaporation rates from lakes expressed e g tetzlaff and adams 1983 finch and gash 2002 16 s 1 α l l q h q e 0 where qh and qe are sensible and latent heat fluxes w m 2 equation 16 is iteratively solved using newton s algorithm a convergence is attained after 4 to 6 iterations the water temperature is then derived from the equilibrium temperature using the following form t w n t w n 1 m te t w n 17 where t w n is the current temperature t w n 1 is the water temperature at the previous time step te is the equilibrium temperature and m is the heat exchange coefficient across the surface atmosphere boundary this coefficient represents the various heat transfer modes radiant sensible and latent e g sweers 1976 edinger et al 1974 finch and gash 2002 m δ t ρ c w h 4 ε w σ t w 3 f u ψ δ 18 where δt is time step month ρ c w are the density kg m 3 and specific heat of brine jkg 1k 1 and h is the mixed layer depth m the transfer coefficient term depends on surface temperature and the wind function because of coupling equation 18 was solved iteratively 4 5 bathymetry of the dead sea the bathymetry of the dead sea is derived from a high resolution digital elevation data hall 1996 arc gis version 10 8 was employed to derive a contour map with an interval of 10 m to derive the area at each interval fig 3 displays a 50 m contour map of the dead sea and fig 4 displays the hypsometric curve area versus depth of the dead sea as deduced from a 10 m contour interval the correspondence between sea area and level was fit to each other using a linear interpolation algorithm 19 a a i 1 x l i 1 l i l i 1 a i a i 1 where is the current level li and li 1 are levels at i and i 1time steps respectively and ai and ai 1 are the corresponding areas at level li and li 1 respectively a is the new area corresponding to level x the present algorithm provides accurate correspondence between area and level 5 data sources 5 1 meteorological data data obtained from the meteorology department in jordan were cross correlated with observed data reported by hecht and gertman 2003 and hamdani et al 2018 table 1 shows the monthly values of meteorological forcings employed to run the model meteorological forcings are usually stable and do not exhibit noticeable variations from year to year over the lake continuous observations over the dead sea during the period 17 june 1992 through 19 february 2002 as reported by hecht and gertman 2003 indicated that the near surface air temperature and relative humidity over the lake differ slightly from those observed over the nearby terrain air temperature above the sea was less by 0 5 1 0 oc during summer and warmer by 1 2 oc during winter see hecht and gertman 2003 5 2 hydrological data the water inflow to the dead sea particularly flooding experiences significant interannual fluctuations due to the transitional nature of the catchment area gertman 2012 indicated that during the period 1996 through 2010 water inflow to the dead sea including precipitation was in the range 265 335 106 m3 a 1which is in close agreement with figures provided by lensky et al 2005 and oroud 2011 the most comprehensive and up to date hydrological data were reported by siebert et al 2014 they used simulation methods high resolution optical and thermal images biogeochemical analysis and field campaigns to derive the different sources of water inflow to the lake discharge from the jordan river which is the main freshwater source to the lake exhibited large interannual variations gertman 2012 reported an annual discharge in the range 60 160 106 m3 a 1 while measured annual discharges for 2010 and 2011 at the baptism site as reported by siebert et al 2014 were 60 and 172 106 m3 a 1 these large interannual variations of flow from the jordan river reflect the substantial interannual variations of precipitation over the catchment area and point out to the uncertainty of freshwater inflow to the dead sea average annual precipitation over the lake is close to 70 mm a 1 table 2 shows the estimates of water input to the dead sea as reported by siebert et al 2014 6 model performance 6 1 modeled level the current model is run for the period 1928 through 2030 for model verification purposes data compiled by the harza jrv group 1996 were used as input for the model during the period 1928 1996 for the period 1997 through 2021 the model was run using data provided by the arab potash company and climatological data obtained from the jordan meteorological department and data obtained by hecht and gertman 2003 the data set consists of annual sea level measurements and monthly freshwater inputs to the dead sea precipitation over the surface of the lake is taken as the long term average of that reported at the south and north of the dead sea being located in a highly arid gorge the dead sea receives a meager amount of precipitation and thus uncertainty in this term has little if any effects on the overall water balance monthly withdrawn and reject end brine are taken from data compiled by the arab potash company climatological data compiled for the period 1974 2021and 1993 2021 for two stations on the eastern side were used in running the model prior to 1974 the climate of the dead sea was assumed to be stationary and the average yearly cycle was assumed to be repeated during the simulation period 1928 1974 and errors resulting from it would indeed be relatively small because the annual cycles of climatic elements in this hyper arid gorge experienced very little variations during that period this assumption is consistent with climatic data recorded in adjacent stations e g amman airport irbid which had records from the early 1920 1930 and did not exhibit any detectable variations during that period oroud 2018 fig 5 shows simulated dead sea level versus observed values during the period 1928 through 2030 the model was able to resolve the dead sea level fluctuations accurately and matches closely observed values a set of statistical indicators were used to evaluate the performance of the simulation model the pearson correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse and lin s concordance correlation coefficient lccc were implemented in the analysis for the correlation coefficient and the lccc the agreement ranges from 1 to 1 and the closer the value to one the higher the confidence in the model prediction the rmse is a measure of how spread out the residuals from the regression line linking predicted against observed values the agreement would be best if its value is close to zero the various error indicators are written in the following form lin 2000 zhang et al 2022 r i 1 n l o i l o l p i l p i 1 n l o i l o 2 i 1 n l p i l p 2 20 rmse i 1 n l p i l o i n 2 21 lccc 2 r σ o σ p σ o 2 σ p 2 l o l p 2 22 where n is the number of data loi and lpi are the measured and predicted values of the ith level σo and σp are the standard deviation of the measured and predicted levels l o is the average observed level and l p is the average simulated lake level the correlation coefficient rmse and the lccc are 0 998 0 675 m and 0 997 respectively these results indicate a high performance of the model presented in this investigation 6 2 modeled temperature monthly temperatures predicted by the model under the current chemical composition are compared to atmospherically corrected surface temperatures retrieved from band 10 onboard landsat 8 a detailed discussion of the procedure involved in obtaining the surface temperature and the corrections involved are presented in cristobal et al 2018 see also nehorai et al 2013 fig 6 displays a scatter diagram of modeled temperature against the average of 3000 randomly distributed satellite pixels within the middle of the dead sea the correlation coefficient rmse and the lccc are 0 973 1 365 c and 0 969 respectively modeled temperatures are also commensurate when compared to measured data by hecht and gertman 2003 giving a rmse of 1 53 oc see also oroud 2019b 2020 the statistical measures presented above for the level changes and for the mixed layer temperature lend strong support to the adequacy of the present model the model was able to predict the actual drop of the dead sea during the period 1928 through 2021 with a high degree of confidence likewise monthly temperatures predicted by the model were in good agreement with measured data and atmospherically corrected high resolution satellite data despite the high agreement between the simulated and observed lake level there are some deviations between the two level sets particularly during the early stages of the simulation period these deviations are likely linked to uncertainty in the reported incoming freshwater particularly flooding from side wadies and groundwater discharge to the lake 7 simulation results simulation models have the capacity to reproduce unlimited number of scenarios making it possible to test the sensitivity of a system to a large number of different boundary conditions while some scenarios assume the continuation of average freshwater input experienced during the past 10 20 years and unchanging climate conditions over the lake and surroundings in the future other scenarios assume drier and or warmer and drier conditions although the number of scenarios can be very large it is opted to limit the number to 10 scenarios these scenarios are born in mind given the increased demands on freshwater within the riparian states of the jordan river and the projected aridification and warming trend in the eastern mediterranean ipcc 2022 table 3 shows the assumed scenarios columns 1 2 and 3 all simulations were started in 2009 and that the industrial activities continue for the following 60 years from the start of simulation under current freshwater input maintained brine withdrawal and stationary climate the dead sea will reach a level of 450 m and an area of 578 km2 in 2035 corresponding values for 2050 would be 465 m and 560 km2 simulation shows that the dead sea level decreases appreciably during potash production cessation of industrial activity after 60 years from the start of simulation leads to a sudden change in level decline the steep decline during the potash production stage reflects the significant impact of brine withdrawal on the dead sea level drop and areal retreat fig 7 displays the decline of the dead sea for eight selected scenarios the decline is relatively steep in the following 100 200 years then the decline starts to level off as time passes an inflection point occurs 100 150 years from the start of simulation depending on freshwater input and boundary conditions it is well documented that evaporation rate is inversely proportional to the level of the activity of the lake surface the continuous drop of the activity leads to increased surface temperature which in turn increases sensible heat flux to the contiguous atmosphere and also increases the upwelling longwave radiation reducing the available energy for evaporation moreover the volume of evaporation decreases with the shrinkage of lake surface area these two mechanisms reduction in the activity and lake area shrinkage explain the asymptotic nature of lake level decline after 100 200 years from the start of simulation simulation results show that with a freshwater input of 400 106 m3 a 1 the lake will reach a quasi steady state equilibrium at 510 m bsl and an area of 508 km2 corresponding values for freshwater input of 300 106 m3 a 1 leads to a level of 530 m bsl and an area of 490 km2 an increase in air temperature by 2 oc after 2050 along with 300 106 m3 a 1 of freshwater input results in a lake level of 543 m bsl and an area of 480 km2 the lake reaches 585 m bsl when assuming that precipitation is the only water source reaching the lake the dead sea reaches a quasi steady state equilibrium when water input from different sources balances water loss by evaporation an equilibrium is established when consecutive annual cycles of simulations become identical and thus simulation is terminated this is calculated by comparing the area of the twelve month period with their counterparts of the previous integration year with an error tolerance of 0 001 km2 the levels areal extents and time needed to attain equilibrium for the 10 selected scenarios are presented in fig 7 and table 3 the time needed for the lake to reach an equilibrium under the different scenarios is several hundred years depending on freshwater input and boundary conditions e g air temperature increase wind speed departure fig 8 show the areal extent of the dead sea when its level would be 510 m bsl and 550 m bsl superimposed on the surface area of the lake for the year 2021 these levels and areal extents correspond to 400 106 m3 a 1 and 200 106 m3 a 1 respectively substantial areal shrinkage of the dead sea will occur following the drop in lake level the shores of the lake will migrate northward by more than 5 km in the southern corner the northern and western portions of the lake will also experience significant areal retreat this retreat and the significant level drop of the dead sea will have important implications on underground aquifers and the spatial distribution of sinkhole development and thus on the infrastructure roads and buildings agriculture industry and tourism a very small retreat is observed along the eastern parts near the center of the lake due to the steep topography in this area see fig 4 a canyon like shape is expected to occur along the central eastern part of the lake 8 analytic examination an analytic treatment can be used as an independent check to examine the simulation results the water temperature and activity of a hypersaline lake like the dead sea can be approximated directly using the combination equation or a dalton type equation oroud 2019a the latter is preferable because of the very few parameters required for the calculation excluding the many uncertainties involved in the parameters needed in the combination equation like solar and longwave radiation terms this analytic approach can be implemented to resolved simultaneously the resulting activity and temperature under equilibrium conditions under given freshwater input and atmospheric forcings an equilibrium steady state water balance for a closed hypersaline lake like the dead sea is established when the incoming freshwater inflow and precipitation on the surface of the lake are equivalent to water loss by evaporation 23 p p r o f u β e s e a where pp and ro are precipitation and total freshwater input kg m 2 a 1 this can be translated to energy units f u is the transfer coefficient wm 2 hpa 1 β is the equilibrium activity of the hypersaline solution es and ea are saturation and ambient vapor pressure hpa eqn 23 is transcendental and has to be solved iteratively see oroud 2019a the solution of this equation yields temperature and activity at the steady state conditions under the specified freshwater input and atmospheric forcings the activity values deduced from the simulation results and from eqn 23 are presented in table 3 obtained activity from both methods are very close to each other for instance the activity of the lake with freshwater input of 400 106 m3 a 1 is 0 5 for both methods other values are very close to each other the main limitation to this method is that the surface area of a hypersaline lake must be known a priori to translate freshwater input to energy units an interesting situation would be the equilibrium activity of the dead sea when precipitation is the only freshwater source in this case there is no need to know the area of the lake assuming isothermal conditions for the evaporation process from the lake as caried out by krumgalz et al 2000 eqn 23 would yield an equilibrium activity of 0 52 which is similar to the result obtained by krumgalz et al under non isothermal conditions as implied in eqn 23 and when precipitation is the only freshwater source to the lake eqn 23 yields an activity of 0 31 due to the substantial temperature rise of the lake resulting from the activity decline in fact the lake temperature will reach 33 5 oc at an equilibrium of 0 31 since precipitation over the dead sea in energy units is quite meagre 5 4 wm 2 the activity of the lake under equilibrium conditions when precipitation is the only freshwater source is determined primarily by the ambient vapor pressure figures obtained by the analytic procedure are commensurate with corresponding values obtained by the simulation method an important note regarding the analytic procedure is that results obtained using thermodynamic concepts were resolved without resorting to any restricting assumptions other than the surface area of the lake at the specific freshwater input in this formulation the final temperature and activity are driven towards equilibrium based on freshwater input and the atmospheric boundary conditions of the surrounding environment regardless of the specified initial conditions the above analytic results substantiate the validity of the simulation results presented in this investigation independently 9 discussion and conclusion unlike freshwater lakes where water loss by evaporation proceeds at isothermal conditions evaporation from hypersaline lakes behaves very differently due to a chain of complex feedback mechanisms resulting from the alterations to the activity of the brine significant nonlinear thermodynamic feedbacks on lake temperature and water loss by evaporation will occur following alterations to the mass balance the temperature change following an alteration to β can be investigated using the following expression oroud 2001a b 24 t β γ f u e s 4 ε σ t 3 f u β δ ψ all terms as presented earlier as can be seen from eqn 24 a drop in β will increase the lake temperature depending on the initial temperature and the wind function for instance at an average surface temperature of 25 oc a decline in β from 0 65 to 0 50 leads to a temperature rise of 2 oc while a similar drop in β at a temperature of 30 oc leads to a temperature rise of 2 3 oc under similar atmospheric forcings see fig 9 modifications to the temperature will subsequently alter evaporation via its impacts on net radiation and the saturation vapor pressure a drop in the activity will influence evaporation oroud 2019a 25 e β f u e s β e s t t β eqn 25 shows oroud 2001b that the two terms on the right act opposite to each other one suppresses evaporation while the other increases it as β declines the overall net result of a suppressed activity however would be a reduction in evaporation because the first term on the right es is always larger than the second term βδγ see eqn 24 the feedback the second term in eqn 25 increases as β departs away from unity and as temperature of the saline solution increases thus unlike freshwater there is strong feedback occurring due to alterations to β the area of a closed lake like the dead sea can be used to gauge freshwater input if evaporation from the lake surface is adequately evaluated the equilibrium area for a closed lake when water loss occurs via evaporation only can be evaluated using the water balance equation 26 a r e p where a is area of the closed lake m2 r e and p are freshwater input from catchment l3 t 1 evaporation from and precipitation over the lake l t 1 respectively as an example eqn 26 can be used to approximate freshwater input to the dead sea prior to 1960 when it was in a quasi steady state equilibrium using the area of the lake prior to 1960 as 950 km2 annual evaporation rates in the range 1550 1650 mm a 1 and precipitation of 70 mm over the lake neumann 1958 eqn 26 would yield an annual inflow in the range of 1400 1500 106 m3 a 1 using the evaporation estimates given by stanhill 1994 of 1270 mm a 1 prior to 1960 eqn 26 yields an average freshwater inflow of about 1140 106 m3 a 1 at that time this freshwater estimate is much smaller than those given by most other investigators neumann 1958 calder and neal 1984 gertman 2012 siebert et al 2014 eqn 26 shows that when freshwater input to the lake is 400 106 m3 a 1 then evaporation from the lake surface would be 800 mm a 1 and 270 mm a 1 when freshwater input is 100 106 m3 a 1 the present investigation is dealing with a complex system with a host of nonlinear feedback mechanisms a system may be considered unstable when a small perturbation causes a significant shift to model output myriad numbers of sensitivity tests can be performed on the present model for clarification purposes a sensitivity test was implemented to identify the response of the dead sea to different formulations of calculating incoming longwave radiation the brunt formula 0 66 0 039 ea e g jimmnez et al 1987 lensky et al 2005 yang et al 2023 was used for instance the use of the above parameterizations in calculating atmospheric longwave radiation when freshwater inflow is 400 106 m3 a 1 and 60 years of potash production resulted in a level difference of less than one meter and one year simulation difference between this parameterization and the brutsaert formulation originally adopted in this investigation when using an intercept of 0 605 and a slope of 0 048 a relatively large departure in incoming longwave radiation then the difference in level is 5 m and a time simulation difference of 6 years for the extreme case when precipitation is the only water source reaching the dead sea and assuming that potash production proceeds for 60 years then the parameterization 0 66 0 039 yielded an equilibrium level of 585 71 against 585 44 for the current one when the parameterization is 0 605 0 048 then the final dead sea level is 582 m these differences are indeed very small it should be noted that a change in energy input will influence the future level and areal extent of the dead sea as a departure in energy input will affect the energy balance components surface temperature and evaporation rates these differences are expected for a complex system like the dead sea with many nonlinear feedback loops some uncertainties also arise from other parameterizations adopted in the model for instance it was assumed in many simulation scenarios that the climate of the dead sea will be stationary given the long time span involved the climate of the dead sea is expected to be influenced by natural climate variabilities and global warming another subtle influence yet important is the air temperature rise resulting from the continuous lowering of the dead sea level as dictated by the atmospheric lapse rate 0 7 oc 100 m drop in lake level this air temperature increase will affect the surface energy balance lake temperature evaporation rates and the activity of the brine adding to the complexity of the problem a major important natural forcing expected to influence the projection of the future fate of the dead sea is global warming a recent ipcc report indicated that the projected annual mean temperature increase on land at the end of the 21 century will be in the range 0 9 5 6 c along with a drop in annual precipitation it is also stated that a temperature rise of 1 oc will be accompanied by 4 reduction in annual precipitation in the eastern mediterranean ipcc 2022 a temperature rise leads to higher potential evaporation and thus more desiccated soils leading to a steep reduction in blue water fluxes groundwater and surface runoff the combination of natural forcings along with population increase in the levant imposes a composite effect on the available water resources triggering more extraction of freshwater to meet the growing demands for irrigation and domestic needs the net result of population growth and global warming would be a steep reduction in freshwater input to the lake thus without any restoration measures it is expected that the future fate of the dead sea will be at the lower end of the levels presented in the simulation results a viable option to restore or at least to curb further deterioration of the dead sea though with adverse consequences would be the red sea dead sea canal declaration of competing interest the author declares that he has no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
1751,an energy balance model run on a monthly time step for 800 years was developed to predict the future level areal extent and temperature of the dead sea under different scenarios of freshwater input and atmospheric boundary conditions the model integrates energy water and salt balances the bathymetry of the dead sea was derived from high resolution digital elevation data model results were verified against measured lake level for the period 1928 through 2022 predicted levels are very close to observed values as demonstrated by three statistical measures the monthly temperatures of the mixed layer as predicted by the model were also commensurate with observational results and satellite derived data future simulation predictions were verified against a novel diagnostic analytic method developed in this investigation the newly developed method has the potential to approximate the equilibrium activity and temperature of hypersaline lakes under specified freshwater inflow and atmospheric forcings results show that the future level areal extent and temperature of the dead sea will be contingent on freshwater inflow and the prevailing atmospheric forcings projections indicate that the dead sea will end up as a dwarfed hypersaline hot lake the time span needed for the dead sea to reach a quasi steady state equilibrium is several hundred years simulations results presented in this investigation are expected to be approximate given the complexity of the system the long integration time involved and uncertainties brought about by climate vagaries and model parameterizations keywords dead sea future fate hypersaline lakes modeling diagnostic procedures water balance equilibrium activity and temperature data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the dead sea is a hypersaline endorheic lake situated in the deepest part of the jordan rift valley being a closed lake the dead sea level fluctuations and the deep sediment records have extensively been used to reconstruct paleoclimate during the holocene and earlier geological epochs for the levant klein and flohn 1987 bookman et al 2004 bookman et al 2006 neugebauer 2015 müller et al 2022 sediment records were used to investigate hydroclimate and vegetations patterns at the desert fringe in relation to past and future climate dynamics stein and goldstein 2020 sharp climate transitions from pluvial to dry conditions and vice versa were observed during the holocene and these climate shifts were characterized by significant changes in human culture issar 1995 green 2004 kagan et al 2015 the level fluctuations of the dead sea were implemented by numerous investigators to deduce precipitation in the levant during the late holocene e g enzel et al 2003 morin et al 2018 for instance morin et al 2018 used a stochastic framework to generate ensemble of precipitation estimates to reconstruct precipitation in the late holocene in the levant based on lake level fluctuations as derived by bookman et al 2004 there is no evidence that the dead sea disappeared in the past several thousand years and that its level was fluctuating between 392 and 415 m below mean sea level bsl e g bookman et al 2004 2006 during the late holocene the areal extent of the lake was confined to the deep northern basin for most of the time see also morin et al 2018 the substantial imbalance in recent years between freshwater input on the one hand and natural evaporation and brine withdrawal for industrial activities on the other resulted in a large level drop and areal shrinkage leading to significant alteration to the chemical composition of the lake metzger et al 2018 vey et al 2021 the brine specific gravity increased from 1 175 prior to 1960 to a current value of 1 24 likewise its activity declined from 0 78 prior to 1960 to a current value of 0 65 e g zilberman et al 2017 lensky et al 2018 vey et al 2021 there has been a real concern that the dead sea will dry up in the future given its very large negative water budget during the past several decades numerous investigators examined the future level and areal extent of the dead sea using a variety of methods e g empirical equations e g anati and shasha 1990 gavrieli et al 1989 stanhill 1994 harza jrv group 1996 yechieli et al 1998 al weshah 2000 the relative humidity concept krumgalz et al 2000 zilberman et al 2017 and water balance calculations e g asmar and ergenzinger 2002a b c results obtained varied widely for instance klein 1990 using the analogy of a single year water budget concluded that the dead sea would reach a state of equilibrium when its level reaches 680 m bsl with an area of 300 km2 krumgalz et al 2000 used the pitzer thermodynamic approach to calculate the ultimate equilibrium activity of the dead sea that is when water loss by evaporation is balanced by condensation from the adjacent atmosphere they concluded that a state of equilibrium will be attained when the activity coefficient of the dead sea brine reaches around 50 this activity corresponds to a surface level of about 510 m bsl and a surface area of 526 km2 calculations presented by krumgalz et al were based on isothermal evaporation and assumed no freshwater input or withdrawal from the lake thus thermodynamic feedback mechanisms and other water balance components which have significant impacts on the dead sea water budget were not taken into account see oroud 2019a using a water balance approach asmar and ergenzinger 2002b c projected that the dead sea will continue dropping for the following 500 years authors did not specify a final level to the dead sea zilberman et al 2017 discussed the future fate of the dead sea based on field observations and relative humidity concepts and concluded that the lake will reach an equilibrium when its activity is lower than that proposed by krumgalz et al 2000 these wide variations in the prediction of lake level and its areal extent reflect the complexity of the problem and the high level of uncertainty in the estimates the above projections become irreconcilable when taking into account uncertainties in freshwater input industrial activities climate change scenarios and the nonlinear thermodynamic feedback the present investigation revisits the future fate of the dead sea using a physically based model which takes into account freshwater input brine withdrawal for industrial purposes and the projected global warming an analytic procedure is developed in this paper to examine the simulation results 2 study area the dead sea is an endorheic hypersaline lake situated in a pull apart tectonic depression occupying the lowest continental land on the earth surface frumkin and raz 2001 the catchment area of the dead sea is 40000 km2 which spans climatic conditions ranging from hyper arid in the southern parts to sub humid mediterranean in the northern reach of the catchment fig 1 shows the location of the dead sea along with the nearby adjacent areas fig 1 also shows the spatial retreat of the lake during the past 60 years the climatic conditions prevailing over the lake are hyper arid and average annual precipitation over the surface of the lake is 70 mm potential evaporation in this deep gorge is in excess of 2600 mm year e g oroud 2020 being very hypersaline the dead sea water loss by evaporation is less than one half of potential evaporation oroud 2001a oroud 2011 metzger et al 2018 vey et al 2021 the air temperature is quite high with an average of 34 oc in july and august and 17 oc in january 3 recent changes to the dead sea until the end of the first half of the twentieth century the water level of the dead sea was quasi stationary with small fluctuations that reflected the inter annual variability of surface runoff from its large but relatively arid catchment area long term average runoff from its catchment area prior to 1960 was 35 40 mm a 1 giving an average annual flow of 1400 1500 106 m3 a 1 e g siebert et al 2014 during that period the jordan river supplied more than two third of water inflow to the lake siebert et al 2014 the diversion of the jordan river and the constructions of numerous water dams on side wadies along with the aridification trend in the eastern mediterranean in recent years have exacerbated the water budget of the dead sea e g kelley et al 2015 cook et al 2016 the significant anthropogenic interventions reduced the volume of freshwater reaching the lake by more than 75 80 compared to historical times e g lensky et al 2005 oroud 2011 siebert et al 2014 the water budget of the dead sea is strongly influenced by the commercial facilities at its southern corner where large quantities of brine are withdrawn for potash production and other byproducts the average annual brine withdrawal from the dead sea has been 550 million m3 around 45 50 of which returns to the lake as highly concentrated end brine siebert et al 2014 zilberman et al 2017 the arab potash company 2021 apc as a result of these large scale anthropogenic interventions the lake level has been declining steadily and its level dropped down from 392 m bsl

2021 of 600 km2 a shrinkage of about 40 fig 1 fig 2 displays the dead sea level changes from1928 through 2021 apc 2021 4 method of investigation a variety of methods were employed in this investigation to derive the water balance of the dead sea and its areal extent detailed discussions of the energy budget mass and salt balances are presented below 4 1 water balance the water mass balance of the dead sea may be written in the following form e g oroud 1997 lensky et al 2005 akridge 2008 δ m δ t ro suf wb rb a p e 1 where δm δt is the mass change with respect to time m t 1 ro suf wb and rb are runoff subsurface flow brine withdrawal and return flow m t 1 a is the surface area of the lake l2 p and e are precipitation and evaporation l t 1 respectively evaporation from a saline

evaporation β is the activity coefficient and ф is the meteorological forcing e g net radiation air temperature wind speed ambient vapor pressure atmospheric stability atmospheric pressure the

2020 β e s t i s i e s t i 3 where β is the activity coefficient si is salinity specific gravity of the saline solution and ti is its surface temperature the activity for a saline solution depends on the concentration of dissolved salts and their ionic strength e g dickson et al 1965 turk 1970 calder and neal 1984 folchitto 1991 this coefficient varies from values close to 0 97 for the open oceans to less than 0 20 for very hypersaline solutions similar to those in sinkholes along the retreating dead sea shoreline zilberman et al 2017 evaporation from a lake surface may be estimated using a variety of methods e g a dalton type equation eddy covariance method bowen ratio and the penman method metzger et al 2018 hamdani et al 2018 lensky et al 2018 mor et al 2018 oroud 2019b 2020 in this

zero for a long integration time 4 3 salinity and density calculations the salt balance in the dead sea is a complex function of natural forcings and man made activities large quantities of brine are withdrawn from the dead sea for potash production and other byproducts around 550 million m3 of brine is withdrawn annually of which around 250 280 million m3 of highly saline brine is returned to the dead sea as reject brine apc 2021 the salinity and specific gravity of reject brine is 450 gl 1 and 1 34 respectively zilberman et al 2017 these processes along with brine concentration resulting from the large amount of evaporation have to be included in the calculation of the salt balance of the dead sea assuming a uniform distribution of salinity across the dead sea the salt balance for a unit area can be calculated using the following approximations lensky et al 2005 m t m w m s 10 ms si mt 11 where mt is the total mass of the column mw is the mass of water ms and si are the mass of salt and brine salinity the change in salt mass for the dead sea is a function of incoming salt contributed from surface runoff and underground recharge s i n withdrawn brine s i w b for potash production and reject brine s r r b flowing back from the concentration ponds and salt precipitation sp respectively 12 δ m s s i n s r r b s i w w s p the overall change in salinity is also influenced by the change in the mass balance δ m t of the dead sea resulting from mass inflow and that lost by evaporation expressed as 13 δ m t p ρ i n r i n ρ r b r r b s p ρ d s w b e where p ρin rin ρ r r r b ρ d s w b e are mass of precipitation incoming flow reject brine withdrawn brine and evaporation respectively the new salinity of the dead sea after a given time step may be calculated using the following form 14 s i n m s δ m s m t δ m t as indicated by numerous investigators e g gavrieli et al 1989 sirota et al 2016 the dead sea column is slightly oversaturated year around below the mixing layer below 20 25 m while the surface layer experiences a seasonal cycle alternating from over saturation in winter and undersaturation during the hot summer months when the surface temperature increases appreciably using high resolution temperature profiling arnon et al 2014 2016 observed double diffusion salt fingering across the transitional zone between the mixed surface layer and the deep layer in summer this double diffusion is responsible for the prevalence of undersaturation of the mixed layer in summer despite the high evaporation rates during this period precipitation of halite was observed in the deep layers whereas halite crystallization and its subsequent dissolution occurs in shallow areas of the dead sea during the course of year sirota et al 2016 2021 complicating significantly the calculations of salt balance of the dead sea measurements by lensky et al 2005 during the winter months when the lake becomes fully mixed indicated that 0 1 m of halite is precipitated at the lake bottom per year and that the density of brine increases by 0 24 kg m 3 each year thus salt balance calculations are approximate in nature given the many uncertainties of processes influencing salt mass balance such as the contribution of subsurface flow evaporation crystallization and dissolution within the deep and shallow layers in the dead sea salt precipitated at the lake bottom as obtained from the work of lensky et al 2005a is taken into account in the calculation of salt mass balance in this paper the activity coefficient is strongly linked to brine density as demonstrated by zilberman et al 2017 in this investigation the activity is calculated based on a polynomial formula presented by asmar and ergenzinger 2002 based on data presented by oroud 1994 1995 15 β 30 285 77 65 ρ 62 712 ρ 2 16 3 ρ 3 where β is the activity coefficient and ρ is the specific gravity of the saline water 4 4 water temperature in this investigation the dead sea column was broken down into two layers a surface layer at the top with a virtual depth of 15 m and the deep column which extends from the bottom of the surface layer to the bottom of the sea the top layer will float over the deeper layer as long as density of the former is lower than the deeper one mixing between the two layers occurs when the density of the top layer becomes similar or larger than the deeper one the density of the top layer is a function of salt flux and thermal expansion caused by heating from solar radiation sirota et al 2016 the water temperature is calculated based on the concept of the equilibrium temperature e g sweers 1976 the equilibrium temperature is defined as that at which the sum of energy fluxes across the surface atmosphere boundary vanishes e g finch and gash 2002 it was shown that the concept of the equilibrium temperature can be applied successfully to evaluate temperature and evaporation rates from lakes expressed e g tetzlaff and adams 1983 finch

iteratively 4 5 bathymetry of the dead sea the bathymetry of the dead sea is derived from a high resolution digital elevation data hall 1996 arc gis version 10 8 was employed to derive a contour map with an interval of 10 m to derive the area at each interval fig 3 displays a 50 m contour map of the dead sea and fig 4 displays the hypsometric curve area versus depth of the dead sea as deduced from a 10 m contour interval the correspondence between sea area and level was fit to each other using a linear interpolation algorithm 19 a a i 1 x l i 1 l i l i 1 a i a i 1 where is the current

algorithm provides accurate correspondence between area and level 5 data sources 5 1 meteorological data data obtained from the meteorology department in jordan were cross correlated with observed data reported by hecht and gertman 2003 and hamdani et al 2018 table 1 shows the monthly values of meteorological forcings employed to run the model meteorological forcings are usually stable and do not exhibit noticeable variations from year to year over the lake continuous observations over the dead sea during the period 17 june 1992 through 19 february 2002 as reported by hecht and gertman 2003 indicated that the near surface air temperature and relative humidity over the lake differ slightly from those observed over the nearby terrain air temperature above the sea was less by 0 5 1 0 oc during summer and warmer by 1 2 oc during winter see hecht and gertman 2003 5 2 hydrological data the water inflow to the dead sea particularly flooding experiences significant interannual fluctuations due to the transitional nature of the catchment area gertman 2012 indicated that during the period 1996 through 2010 water inflow to the dead sea including precipitation was in the range 265 335 106 m3 a 1which is in close agreement with figures provided by lensky et al 2005 and oroud 2011 the most comprehensive and up to date hydrological data were reported by siebert et al 2014 they used simulation methods high resolution optical and thermal images biogeochemical analysis and field campaigns to derive the different sources of water inflow to the lake discharge from the jordan river which is the main freshwater source to the lake exhibited large interannual variations gertman 2012 reported an annual discharge in the range 60 160 106 m3 a 1 while measured annual discharges for 2010 and 2011 at the baptism site as reported by siebert et al 2014 were 60 and 172 106 m3 a 1 these large interannual variations of flow from the jordan river reflect the substantial interannual variations of precipitation over the catchment area and point out to the uncertainty of freshwater inflow to the dead sea average annual precipitation over the lake is close to 70 mm a 1 table 2 shows the estimates of water input to the dead sea as reported by siebert et al 2014 6 model performance 6 1 modeled level the current model is run for the period 1928 through 2030 for model verification purposes data compiled by the harza jrv group 1996 were used as input for the model during the period 1928 1996 for the period 1997 through 2021 the model was run using data provided by the arab potash company and climatological data obtained from the jordan meteorological department and data obtained by hecht and gertman 2003 the data set consists of annual sea level measurements and monthly freshwater inputs to the dead sea precipitation over the surface of the lake is taken as the long term average of that reported at the south and north of the dead sea being located in a highly arid gorge the dead sea receives a meager amount of precipitation and thus uncertainty in this term has little if any effects on the overall water balance monthly withdrawn and reject end brine are taken from data compiled by the arab potash company climatological data compiled for the period 1974 2021and 1993 2021 for two stations on the eastern side were used in running the model prior to 1974 the climate of the dead sea was assumed to be stationary and the average yearly cycle was assumed to be repeated during the simulation period 1928 1974 and errors resulting from it would indeed be relatively small because the annual cycles of climatic elements in this hyper arid gorge experienced very little variations during that period this assumption is consistent with climatic data recorded in adjacent stations e g amman airport irbid which had records from the early 1920 1930 and did not exhibit any detectable variations during that period oroud 2018 fig 5 shows simulated dead sea level versus observed values during the period 1928 through 2030 the model was able to resolve the dead sea level fluctuations accurately and matches closely observed values a set of statistical indicators were used to evaluate the performance of the simulation model the pearson correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse and lin s concordance correlation coefficient lccc were implemented in the analysis for the correlation coefficient and the lccc the agreement ranges from 1 to 1 and the closer the value to one the higher the confidence in the model prediction the rmse is a measure of how spread out the residuals from the regression line linking predicted against observed values the agreement would be best if its value is close to zero the various error indicators are written in the following form lin 2000 zhang et al 2022 r i 1 n l o i l o l p i l p i 1 n l o i l o 2 i 1 n l p i l p 2 20 rmse i 1 n l p i l o i n 2 21 lccc 2 r σ o σ p σ o 2 σ p 2 l o l p 2 22 where n is the number of data loi and lpi are the measured and predicted values of the ith level σo and σp are the standard deviation of the measured and predicted levels l o is the average observed level and l p is the average simulated lake level the correlation coefficient rmse and the lccc are 0 998 0 675 m and 0 997 respectively these results indicate a high performance of the model presented in this investigation 6 2 modeled temperature monthly temperatures predicted by the model under the current chemical composition are compared to atmospherically corrected surface temperatures retrieved from band 10 onboard landsat 8 a detailed discussion of the procedure involved in obtaining the surface temperature and the corrections involved are presented in cristobal et al 2018 see also nehorai et al 2013 fig 6 displays a scatter diagram of modeled temperature against the average of 3000 randomly distributed satellite pixels within the middle of the dead sea the correlation coefficient rmse and the lccc are 0 973 1 365 c and 0 969 respectively modeled temperatures are also commensurate when compared to measured data by hecht and gertman 2003 giving a rmse of 1 53 oc see also oroud 2019b 2020 the statistical measures presented above for the level changes and for the mixed layer temperature lend strong support to the adequacy of the present model the model was able to predict the actual drop of the dead sea during the period 1928 through 2021 with a high degree of confidence likewise monthly temperatures predicted by the model were in good agreement with measured data and atmospherically corrected high resolution satellite data despite the high agreement between the simulated and observed lake level there are some deviations between the two level sets particularly during the early stages of the simulation period these deviations are likely linked to uncertainty in the reported incoming freshwater particularly flooding from side wadies and groundwater discharge to the lake 7 simulation results simulation models have the capacity to reproduce unlimited number of scenarios making it possible to test the sensitivity of a system to a large number of different boundary conditions while some scenarios assume the continuation of average freshwater input experienced during the past 10 20 years and unchanging climate conditions over the lake and surroundings in the future other scenarios assume drier and or warmer and drier conditions although the number of scenarios can be very large it is opted to limit the number to 10 scenarios these scenarios are born in mind given the increased demands on freshwater within the riparian states of the jordan river and the projected aridification and warming trend in the eastern mediterranean ipcc 2022 table 3 shows the assumed scenarios columns 1 2 and 3 all simulations were started in 2009 and that the industrial activities continue for the following 60 years from the start of simulation under current freshwater input maintained brine withdrawal and stationary climate the dead sea will reach a level of 450 m and an area of 578 km2 in 2035 corresponding values for 2050 would be 465 m and 560 km2 simulation shows that the dead sea level decreases appreciably during potash production cessation of industrial activity after 60 years from the start of simulation leads to a sudden change in level decline the steep decline during the potash production stage reflects the significant impact of brine withdrawal on the dead sea level drop and areal retreat fig 7 displays the decline of the dead sea for eight selected scenarios the decline is relatively steep in the following 100 200 years then the decline starts to level off as time passes an inflection point occurs 100 150 years from the start of simulation depending on freshwater input and boundary conditions it is well documented that evaporation rate is inversely proportional to the level of the activity of the lake surface the continuous drop of the activity leads to increased surface temperature which in turn increases sensible heat flux to the contiguous atmosphere and also increases the upwelling longwave radiation reducing the available energy for evaporation moreover the volume of evaporation decreases with the shrinkage of lake surface area these two mechanisms reduction in the activity and lake area shrinkage explain the asymptotic nature of lake level decline after 100 200 years from the start of simulation simulation results show that with a freshwater input of 400 106 m3 a 1 the lake will reach a quasi steady state equilibrium at 510 m bsl and an area of 508 km2 corresponding values for freshwater input of 300 106 m3 a 1 leads to a level of 530 m bsl and an area of 490 km2 an increase in air temperature by 2 oc after 2050 along with 300 106 m3 a 1 of freshwater input results in a lake level of 543 m bsl and an area of 480 km2 the lake reaches 585 m bsl when assuming that precipitation is the only water source reaching the lake the dead sea reaches a quasi steady state equilibrium when water input from different sources balances water loss by evaporation an equilibrium is established when consecutive annual cycles of simulations become identical and thus simulation is terminated this is calculated by comparing the area of the twelve month period with their counterparts of the previous integration year with an error tolerance of 0 001 km2 the levels areal extents and time needed to attain equilibrium for the 10 selected scenarios are presented in fig 7 and table 3 the time needed for the lake to reach an equilibrium under the different scenarios is several hundred years depending on freshwater input and boundary conditions e g air temperature increase wind speed departure fig 8 show the areal extent of the dead sea when its level would be 510 m bsl and 550 m bsl superimposed on the surface area of the lake for the year 2021 these levels and areal extents correspond to 400 106 m3 a 1 and 200 106 m3 a 1 respectively substantial areal shrinkage of the dead sea will occur following the drop in lake level the shores of the lake will migrate northward by more than 5 km in the southern corner the northern and western portions of the lake will also experience significant areal retreat this retreat and the significant level drop of the dead sea will have important implications on underground aquifers and the spatial distribution of sinkhole development and thus on the infrastructure roads and buildings agriculture industry and tourism a very small retreat is observed along the eastern parts near the center of the lake due to the steep topography in this area see fig 4 a canyon like shape is expected to occur along the central eastern part of the lake 8 analytic examination an analytic treatment can be used as an independent check to examine the simulation results the water temperature and activity of a hypersaline lake like the dead sea can be approximated directly using the combination equation or a dalton type equation oroud 2019a the latter is preferable because of the very few parameters required for the calculation excluding the many uncertainties involved in the parameters needed in the combination equation like solar and longwave radiation terms this analytic approach can be implemented to resolved simultaneously the resulting activity and temperature under equilibrium conditions under given freshwater input and atmospheric forcings an equilibrium steady state water balance for a closed hypersaline lake like the dead sea is established when the incoming freshwater inflow and precipitation on the surface of the lake are equivalent to water loss by evaporation 23 p p r o f u β e s e a where pp and ro are precipitation and total freshwater input kg m 2 a 1 this can be translated to energy units f u is the transfer coefficient wm 2 hpa 1 β is the equilibrium activity of the hypersaline solution es and ea are saturation and ambient vapor pressure hpa eqn 23 is transcendental and has to be solved iteratively see oroud 2019a the solution of this equation yields temperature and activity at the steady state conditions under the specified freshwater input and atmospheric forcings the activity values deduced from the simulation results and from eqn 23 are presented in table 3 obtained activity from both methods are very close to each other for instance the activity of the lake with freshwater input of 400 106 m3 a 1 is 0 5 for both methods other values are very close to each other the main limitation to this method is that the surface area of a hypersaline lake must be known a priori to translate freshwater input to energy units an interesting situation would be the equilibrium activity of the dead sea when precipitation is the only freshwater source in this case there is no need to know the area of the lake assuming isothermal conditions for the evaporation process from the lake as caried out by krumgalz et al 2000 eqn 23 would yield an equilibrium activity of 0 52 which is similar to the result obtained by krumgalz et al under non isothermal conditions as implied in eqn 23 and when precipitation is the only freshwater source to the lake eqn 23 yields an activity of 0 31 due to the substantial temperature rise of the lake resulting from the activity decline in fact the lake temperature will reach 33 5 oc at an equilibrium of 0 31 since precipitation over the dead sea in energy units is quite meagre 5 4 wm 2 the activity of the lake under equilibrium conditions when precipitation is the only freshwater source is determined primarily by the ambient vapor pressure figures obtained by the analytic procedure are commensurate with corresponding values obtained by the simulation method an important note regarding the analytic procedure is that results obtained using thermodynamic concepts were resolved without resorting to any restricting assumptions other than the surface area of the lake at the specific freshwater input in this formulation the final temperature and activity are driven towards equilibrium based on freshwater input and the atmospheric boundary conditions of the surrounding environment regardless of the specified initial conditions the above analytic results substantiate the validity of the simulation results presented in this investigation independently 9 discussion and conclusion unlike freshwater lakes where water loss by evaporation proceeds at isothermal conditions evaporation from hypersaline lakes behaves very differently due to a chain of complex feedback mechanisms resulting from the alterations to the activity of the brine significant nonlinear thermodynamic feedbacks on lake temperature and water loss by evaporation will occur following alterations to the mass balance the temperature change following an alteration to β can be investigated using the following expression oroud 2001a b 24 t β γ f u e s 4 ε σ t 3 f u β δ ψ all terms as presented earlier as can be seen from eqn 24 a drop in β will increase the lake temperature depending on the initial temperature and the wind function for instance at an average surface temperature of 25 oc a decline in β from 0 65 to 0 50 leads to a temperature rise of 2 oc while a similar drop in β at a temperature of 30 oc leads to a temperature rise of 2 3 oc under similar atmospheric forcings see fig 9 modifications to the temperature will subsequently alter evaporation via its impacts on net radiation and the saturation vapor pressure a drop in the activity will influence evaporation oroud 2019a 25 e β f u e s β e s t t β eqn 25 shows oroud 2001b that the two terms on the right act opposite to each other one suppresses evaporation while the other increases it as β declines the overall net result of a suppressed activity however would be a reduction in evaporation because the first term on the right es is always larger than the second term βδγ see eqn 24 the feedback the second term in eqn 25 increases as β departs away from unity and as temperature of the saline solution increases thus unlike freshwater there is strong feedback occurring due to alterations to β the area of a closed lake like the dead sea can be used to gauge freshwater input if evaporation from the lake surface is adequately evaluated the equilibrium area for a closed lake when water loss occurs via evaporation only can be evaluated using the water balance equation 26 a r e p where a is area of the closed lake m2 r e and p are freshwater input from catchment l3 t 1 evaporation from and precipitation over the lake l t 1 respectively as an example eqn 26 can be used to approximate freshwater input to the dead sea prior to 1960 when it was in a quasi steady state equilibrium using the area of the lake prior to 1960 as 950 km2 annual evaporation rates in the range 1550 1650 mm a 1 and precipitation of 70 mm over the lake neumann 1958 eqn 26 would yield an annual inflow in the range of 1400 1500 106 m3 a 1 using the evaporation estimates given by stanhill 1994 of 1270 mm a 1 prior to 1960 eqn 26 yields an average freshwater inflow of about 1140 106 m3 a 1 at that time this freshwater estimate is much smaller than those given by most other investigators neumann 1958 calder and neal 1984 gertman 2012 siebert et al 2014 eqn 26 shows that when freshwater input to the lake is 400 106 m3 a 1 then evaporation from the lake surface would be 800 mm a 1 and 270 mm a 1 when freshwater input is 100 106 m3 a 1 the present investigation is dealing with a complex system with a host of nonlinear feedback mechanisms a system may be considered unstable when a small perturbation causes a significant shift to model output myriad numbers of sensitivity tests can be performed on the present model for clarification purposes a sensitivity test was implemented to identify the response of the dead sea to different formulations of calculating incoming longwave radiation the brunt formula 0 66 0 039 ea e g jimmnez et al 1987 lensky et al 2005 yang et al 2023 was used for instance the use of the above parameterizations in calculating atmospheric longwave radiation when freshwater inflow is 400 106 m3 a 1 and 60 years of potash production resulted in a level difference of less than one meter and one year simulation difference between this parameterization and the brutsaert formulation originally adopted in this investigation when using an intercept of 0 605 and a slope of 0 048 a relatively large departure in incoming longwave radiation then the difference in level is 5 m and a time simulation difference of 6 years for the extreme case when precipitation is the only water source reaching the dead sea and assuming that potash production proceeds for 60 years then the parameterization 0 66 0 039 yielded an equilibrium level of 585 71 against 585 44 for the current one when the parameterization is 0 605 0 048 then the final dead sea level is 582 m these differences are indeed very small it should be noted that a change in energy input will influence the future level and areal extent of the dead sea as a departure in energy input will affect the energy balance components surface temperature and evaporation rates these differences are expected for a complex system like the dead sea with many nonlinear feedback loops some uncertainties also arise from other parameterizations adopted in the model for instance it was assumed in many simulation scenarios that the climate of the dead sea will be stationary given the long time span involved the climate of the dead sea is expected to be influenced by natural climate variabilities and global warming another subtle influence yet important is the air temperature rise resulting from the continuous lowering of the dead sea level as dictated by the atmospheric lapse rate 0 7 oc 100 m drop in lake level this air temperature increase will affect the surface energy balance lake temperature evaporation rates and the activity of the brine adding to the complexity of the problem a major important natural forcing expected to influence the projection of the future fate of the dead sea is global warming a recent ipcc report indicated that the projected annual mean temperature increase on land at the end of the 21 century will be in the range 0 9 5 6 c along with a drop in annual precipitation it is also stated that a temperature rise of 1 oc will be accompanied by 4 reduction in annual precipitation in the eastern mediterranean ipcc 2022 a temperature rise leads to higher potential evaporation and thus more desiccated soils leading to a steep reduction in blue water fluxes groundwater and surface runoff the combination of natural forcings along with population increase in the levant imposes a composite effect on the available water resources triggering more extraction of freshwater to meet the growing demands for irrigation and domestic needs the net result of population growth and global warming would be a steep reduction in freshwater input to the lake thus without any restoration measures it is expected that the future fate of the dead sea will be at the lower end of the levels presented in the simulation results a viable option to restore or at least to curb further deterioration of the dead sea though with adverse consequences would be the red sea dead sea canal declaration of competing interest the author declares that he has no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
1752,intercomparison studies play an important but limited role in understanding the usefulness and limitations of currently available hydrological models comparison studies are often limited to well

security since it produces 90 of the national production of grain and oilseed valued at more than 2 billion cad annually agriculture and agri food canada 2021 to provide guidance to canada s operational and transboundary water management community it is important to create a comprehensive picture of model performance capabilities over western and central canada to better highlight the model structural deficiencies unique to this regime and across available models this helps the global community in assessing future targeted model developments and provides a framework for assessing models based on their fidelity as opposed to summative streamflow performance which is crucial for water availability projections under future climates these studies also benefit more local authorities in the management of available water resources and water allocation in that complex region and contribute towards water security for future generations as part of the impc initiative the nelson mip intercomparison project fig 1 was established to both benchmark and compare the performance of different hydrological models over a major river basin in western and central canada nelson churchill river basin ncrb fig 2 this intercomparison study is the first of a series of efforts under the nelson mip intercomparison project the main objective of this work is to compare the performance of the participating hydrological and land surface models from both academic and operational institutions across the hydrologically complex ncrb region in reproducing streamflow and other important hydrological processes to ensure model fidelity and to establish a benchmark for expected model performance thresholds a secondary objective is to highlight any necessary model structural improvements that could guide future model development in the hydrological community in this study the performance of eight hydrological and land surface models was assessed and compared at different unregulated headwater watersheds over ncrb this study presents the results of the first two phases of the nelson mip project phase 0 and 1 fig 1 in this study we address the following research questions 1 how do the different models perform in streamflow simulation without and with calibration at different unregulated watersheds in the ncrb compared to observed flow data 2 how do the different models perform in simulating internal hydrological variables at different unregulated watersheds in the ncrb compared to benchmark data 3 do the models give the right answer q1 for the right reason q2 4 why does the models performance vary across different regions ecozones in the ncrb 5 do models need structural improvement to better simulate the ncrb hydrology it is important to note that the intent here is not to compare models relative to each other rather to compare each model s own performance relative to observation benchmark data and then to discuss which ones generally perform better over the ncrb 2 methodology eight hydrological and land surface models were set up over various watersheds of the ncrb some were academic led setups while other contributions were from water resource practitioners using models that are set up for operational use within this region these models used a standardized set of input data processed and provided to all collaborators by m i

periods or smaller godwin and martin 1975 the ncrb expands from the southwestern boundary of alberta canada along the rocky mountains to hudson bay in northeastern manitoba the ncrb crosses alberta saskatchewan manitoba and ontario in canada with headwater watersheds in montana north and south dakota and minnesota in the united states fig 2 b the ncrb comprises seven major subbasins saskatchewan river basin assiniboine river basin red river basin winnipeg river basin lake winnipeg basin lower nelson river basin and the churchill river basin fig 2 a the first six major subbasins form the nelson river basin ncrb encompasses six different ecozones u s environmental protection agency 2010 namely western cordillera 2 1 prairies 36 4 boreal plain 25 4 boreal shield 31 6 taiga shield 3 6 and hudson plain 0 9 fig 2 b the prairies boreal shield and boreal plain are the dominant ecozones in the ncrb the dominant land cover types are forest 30 3 cropland 30 3 wetlands and lakes 21 2 with some patches of shrubland grassland the dominant soil types are loam 43 8 loamy sand 12 3 and clay loam 11 9 these values were identified from the used landcover and soil data in this study which are explained in section 2 4 3 and 2 4 4 below the hydrology of the ncrb is complex due to the different hydrological processes responses glaciers mountain hillslopes permafrost prairie sub arctic vegetation dynamics of the forests wetlands encountered within various ecozones especially the prairies and the high degree of regulation and development practises in the area the existence of the prairie ecozone within ncrb provides additional challenges to the hydrological simulation the prairies are well known for their flat terrain with numerous land depressions that can retain significant amounts of snowmelt and rainfall on the landscape while limiting runoff to streams ahmed et al 2020b shook and pomeroy 2011 runoff production across the prairies typically follows a fill and spill mechanism wherein a depression spills to the downstream depressions or areas after being filled shaw et al 2012 this mechanism results in a dynamic spatiotemporal non contributing area that changes based on the magnitude of net rainfall snowmelt antecedent moisture conditions of the watershed and depressional storage availability ahmed et al 2021 this complex prairie phenomenon makes most hydrological models inapplicable to modelling this region mekonnen et al 2016 2014 such that it has been coined the graveyard of hydrological models by the canadian hydrological community muhammad et al 2019 the ncrb is also dominated by numerous managed and unmanaged lake systems and reservoirs that store significant amounts of surface runoff additionally ncrb is also dominated by numerous wetlands within the boreal plain and boreal shield that have complex dynamics when interacting with surrounding areas price et al 2005 the hudson plain and parts of the taiga shield ecozones are dominated by permafrost which further adds to the complexities of the basin ecological framework of canada 1999 all of these dominant processes and hydrological features make the hydrology of the ncrb challenging a set of watersheds with reliable streamflow gauging stations were derived from the water survey of canada wsc https wateroffice ec gc ca search historical e html and united states geological survey usgs https waterdata usgs gov nwis rt databases for this study the following criteria were used to select the relevant watersheds for this study 1 watersheds with drainage area 200 km2 this was necessary to ensure the watersheds are of relatively medium to large size and to avoid small watersheds with quick flashy response mai et al 2022 2 watersheds with adequate streamflow information during the simulation period 2000 2017 set based on the availability of forcing data section 2 4 1 which was required for model calibration and evaluation where missing data were less than 25 for the period we used the 25 threshold since most of the watersheds in this region have seasonal streamflow gauges with no flow values measured during fall and winter 3 headwater watersheds with no regulated attribute in the wsc database which implies no known visible control structures within the watershed i e streamflow has not been altered by any human influence we used such watersheds to minimize the effect of human influence on the streamflow this resulted in 132 unregulated headwater watersheds in the ncrb fig 2 c covering a total area of almost 0 26 million km2 2 3 participating models eight candidate hydrological and land surface models participated in the study in response to a call for modeller participation the models are hype lindström et al 2010 blended lumped mai et al 2020b watflood kouwen et al 1993 vic liang et al 1994 hec hms us army corps of engineers 2016 swat giw muhammad et al 2018 raven hypr ahmed et al 2020a and raven uwfs taheri et al 2023 hype blended lumped vic raven hypr and raven uwfs are academically research used models form academic institutions while watflood hec hms and swat giw are operationally used models by practitioners in the region each model simulated a subset of the selected watersheds based on the investigators specific interest available resources and prior knowledge of the modelled domain figure s1 hype is the only model that simulated all watersheds in this study because its results were contributed by the leading authors of this work who had a vested interest in the ncrb who developed the experimental setup of this study and had sufficient resources to allocate for the project a brief description of the models is presented in this section and in table 1 a detailed description of the calibrated parameters and their ranges the calibration budget the used algorithm for each dominant process and the simulated watersheds domain for each model is provided in the supplemental file section s1 the models are listed in a descending order based on their simulation area used in the study following the same naming convention used in the grip gl project mai et al 2022 models are classified as local regional or global a local model is defined as a model that has a unique model setup and set of parameters for each simulated watershed a regional model is defined as a model that has a model setup for each major basin in the study e g churchill river assiniboine river saskatchewan river etc or if the model is simulating a subset of the watersheds but using one model setup a global model is one that has only one setup and one parameter set for the full domain the models were also classified based on their spatial resolution as lumped or semi distributed and based on their process representation as conceptual or semi physical combination of conceptual empirical and physical equations table 1 and table s9 2 3 1 hype the hydrological predictions for the environment hype lindström et al 2010 model is a free and open source hydrological model that allows for simulating the different hydrological processes precipitation phase change glaciers snow processes evaporation infiltration runoff wetland and lake dynamics irrigation abstractions regulation tracers etc hype is a semi distributed vector based model which requires the physiographic and meteorological information at the sub basin scale hype uses multiple conceptual empirical and or physical approaches to solve the different hydrological cycle component lindström et al 2010 and the user must set which approach is used to calculate each process when running the model hype discretizes sub basins into different soil and landcover classes slcs computational units similar to the hydrologic response units hrus and it discretizes the soil into three layers by default hype runs on a daily time resolution by default but can run on a sub daily resolution to calculate the hydrological fluxes at the slc scale the results are averaged later to provide sub basin average values hype cannot simulate the prairie pothole dynamics which are dominant over the ncrb in this study hype used a temperature and radiation index method for snowmelt calculations which allowed hype to perform calculations to change snow density precipitation phase change and snow sublimation hype simulated glaciers and thawing and freezing of the soil column hype calculated infiltration as a function of soil storage evapotranspiration was calculated using the modified hargreaves samani method water bodies or wetlands were handled as a lumped lake or lumped wetland within each sub basin and their outflow was calculated using a rating curve method surface runoff was calculated using runoff coefficients and soil water threshold for this study hype simulated all watersheds involved and therefore it was built in a global setup i e one model setup for all watersheds the hype model was built to simulate the entire ncrb to allow it to explore more watersheds in the future but it was deployed calibrated validated at the selected watersheds only 2 3 2 blended lumped the blended lumped model is a hydrological model that was introduced by mai et al 2020 and is defined within the raven hydrological modelling framework craig et al 2020 the blended lumped model uses the weighted average of several chosen process implementations for key processes to simulate streamflow instead of using one single parametrization per process as an example a simplified blended model could define any single hydrological process flux fprocess1 as 1 f p r o c e s s 1 x w w d 1 d 1 w d 2 d 2 with 2 w d 1 w d 2 1 where d 1 and d 2 could be for instance two options or algorithms for one process for example infiltration options could be the infiltration algorithm of hmets d 1 and the infiltration algorithm of hbv d 2 the infiltration outputs d 1 and d 2 are then weighted using w d 1 and w d 2 to compute the raven infiltration flux for the corresponding timestep a complete blended model can include many different weighted process flux equations up to one per process simulated in the model a detailed description of all blended model processes and process options as well as a model flowchart can be found in the supplementary material of mai et al 2020b and in the raven documentation craig 2022 the blended model uses three different options for the infiltration process three options for quick flow two options for evaporation two options for baseflow and three options for snow balance all other processes i e convolution of surface runoff and delayed runoff potential melt percolation rain snow partitioning and precipitation correction were used with one fixed process option the model was set up in lumped mode and simulated 119 basins in total the 13 of the 132 basins not modelled were excluded due to their area being smaller than 300 km2 instead of the threshold of 200 km2 applied for the other basins this was due to an oversight at the beginning of the setup and was not possible to be corrected due to limited resources for this project the model used a daily time step to simulate streamflow and all internal variables and was setup and calibrated for each watershed individually locally calibrated 2 3 3 watflood watflood is a free and open source hydrological model that allows for simulating interception evaporation transpiration snow accumulation and sublimation snowmelt glaciers infiltration interflow recharge baseflow and overland channel and wetland routing watflood is a semi distributed model which requires the physiographic and meteorological information at a grid scale watflood uses conceptual empirical and physical approaches to solve the different hydrological cycle components kouwen et al 1993 watflood discretizes grids into different grus grouped response units and it discretizes the soil into two layers watflood runs on an hourly time resolution to calculate the hydrological fluxes at the grid scale watflood can simulate wetland dynamics and reservoir regulation for this study watflood was used to simulate a subset of the area from the churchill river nelson river and winnipeg river basins we limited the model domain to these watersheds because of limited resources available to re calibrate the entire ncrb for this study in this paper watflood refers to three independent model setups churchill river nelson river and winnipeg river basins that are used operationally however because the meteorological forcing dataset differed from what is used operationally the parameterization and results reported in this paper were for research purposes only 2 3 4 vic the variable infiltration capacity vic model is a free and open source hydrological model that solves water and energy balances and allows simulating all components of the hydrological cycle liang et al 1994 vic is a fully distributed continuous time scale model which handles sub grid heterogeneity e g elevation land cover type via statistical distributions and requires hydrological information at a flat and uniform grid scale 1 km the vic model uses empirical and physical approaches to solve the different hydrological cycle components liang et al 1994 the vic model discretizes a grid cell into different computational units and there is no interaction between grid cells the model runs on a daily time step to calculate the hydrological fluxes at the grid scale the vic model can simulate the dominant prairie pothole dynamics but it did not simulate any prairie watershed in this study wetland dynamics and reservoir regulation for this study vic simulated 10 major sub basins across the lower nelson river basin lnrb we limited the modelling domain to these sub watersheds due to model computational cost and prior knowledge of the basin lilhare et al 2020 2 3 5 hec hms hec hms is a free hydrological model developed by the us army corps of engineers that can simulate canopy interception surface storage infiltration baseflow and recharge evaporation transpiration snow accumulation and melt and overland lake and channel routing including some regulation structures us army corps of engineers 2016 hec hms was set up as a lumped model with a single basin for each watershed hec hms requires meteorological information at the basin scale but physiographic information is not directly ingested by the model instead physiographic data are used to inform realistic parameter ranges for calibration the hec hms model was run as a locally calibrated model and was set up to use a conceptual approach to solving the different hydrological cycle components hec hms was set up to discretize watersheds into three soil layers was set up to run as a continuous model and was run on a daily time step for this study hec hms was used to simulate a subset of the area from the red river basin four watersheds we set the model domain to the red river basin due to limited computational resources and because the area is of interest to the modelling team 2 3 6 swat giw the soil water assessment tool swat hydrological model is a free and open source hydrological model that simulates evapotranspiration surface runoff infiltration and the groundwater flow component of the hydrological cycle swat is a semi distributed continuous time scale model that operates on a daily time step and uses semi physically based approaches to solve the different hydrological cycle component arnold et al 2012 swat discretizes the basin into sub basins and further into different hrus based on a user s defined threshold for this study a modified version of the model swat giw following a procedure similar to that of muhammad et al 2020 was utilized to simulate the upper assiniboine river basin uarb at the kamsack watershed the swat giw model has the capacity to simulate the dominant prairie pothole wetlands fill spill processes and is able to capture the contributing and non contributing area dynamics dibike et al 2021 the modification to the standard version of the swat model resulted in 49 subbasins and 4506 hrus which is why the modelling domain was limited to the uarb only due to model computational cost and prior knowledge of the basin 2 3 7 raven hypr and raven uwfs raven craig et al 2020 is an open source hydrological modelling framework that supports multiple algorithms for representing different hydrological processes such as infiltration evapotranspiration and surface runoff raven can be run in lumped or semi distributed mode and requires hydrological information at the sub basin scale in this study raven discretized watersheds into different hrus and it discretized the soil into three layers two approaches are used for simulating prairie runoff dynamics hypr and uwfs hypr ahmed et al 2020a is an algorithm implemented in raven to simulate the fill and spill dynamics in pothole dominated landscapes of the prairies uwfs taheri et al 2023 is another probabilistic algorithm implemented in raven to simulate the fill and spill processes and is informed by distributional characteristics of pothole complexes such as their local contributing areas and storage deficits raven hypr and raven uwfs run on daily time resolution to calculate the discharge at the watershed scale for this study raven hypr and raven uwfs were used to simulate only the lewis creek watershed located in qu appelle river basin saskatchewan this was the only basin that was shared between this study and the work of taheri et al 2023 2 4 datasets for model development a standardized set of meteorological and physiographic information was used to ensure consistency in building the models and in comparing their performance the input datasets utilized include meteorological forcing elevation dem land cover and soil properties the datasets were chosen as they were agreed upon by many modellers during past projects i e grip gl mai et al 2022 the only new dataset relative to grip gl datasets is the dem selected here and described below 2 4 1 meteorological forcing rdrs v2 the regional deterministic reanalysis system version 2 rdrs v2 gasset et al 2021 was used to force the participating models in this study rdrs v2 was proposed because of its consistent approach in providing the required forcing variables and is based on the reanalysis of the canadian operational numerical weather prediction nwp system called the global environmental multiscale atmospheric model gem mailhot et al 2006 the reanalysis uses the optimal interpolation approach developed for the real time operational canadian precipitation analysis product capa lespinas et al 2015 which has been shown to be reliable over north america fortin et al 2018 however the precipitation estimates of rdrs v2 differ from capa estimates because the former is a reanalysis product and does incorporate more weather station information than what is normally available in real time we chose rdrs v2 because of its reliability and consistency over north america compared to other products gasset et al 2021 the rdrs v2 dataset includes precipitation amount downward solar flux incoming infrared flux specific and relative humidity atmospheric pressure air temperature and wind speed the variables are representative of the near surface level height except relative humidity 40 m above the surface air temperature 1 5 m and wind speed 10 m these are the common components used by many hydrological models rdrs v2 data are available over north america at an approximately 10 km grid resolution and an hourly time scale from 01 to 01 2000 to 31 12 2017 gasset et al 2021 these data were obtained from the canadian surface prediction archive website caspar mai et al 2020a for the ncrb 2 4 2 digital elevation model merit hydro merit hydro yamazaki et al 2019 is a global flow direction map at a 3 arc second resolution 90 m at the equator derived from the latest elevation data and water body datasets it contains flow direction flow accumulation hydrologically adjusted elevations and river channel width we used the hydrologically adjusted dem to delineate the ncrb and its selected watersheds for this study https hydro iis u tokyo ac jp yamadai merit dem we used the merit hydro product because it represents the hydrological features river and stream networks more accurately compared to other available product e g hydrosheds especially for higher latitudes yamazaki et al 2019 different modelling teams used their own approach of delineating the watersheds from the filled merit hydro dem with no sinks that typically denote non contributing areas nca no standardized delineation product was shared with the modelling teams to be used for model setup the nca sinks were ignored by almost all models during the delineation process except hype swat giw raven hypr and raven uwfs hype aggregated all sinks within the watershed as one conceptual lumped lake limited representation of nca while swat giw used the geospatial information of the sinks to parameterize its nca algorithm the two versions of the raven model used conceptual parameters identified through model calibration to parameterize their nca algorithms it is important to note that the watflood model is the only model that used another dem srtm to delineate the watersheds this was because the modelling team used pre existing model setups for the study which was a result of limited resources available to re build the model setups 2 4 3 land cover data nalcms the north american land change monitoring system nalcms latifovic et al 2016 at 30 m resolution was used to obtain the land cover types across the ncrb nalcms provides a harmonized view of the physical cover of earth s surface across the north american continent based on 2010 landsat satellite imagery we used the nalcms product because it is a result of a collaborative initiative between canada us and mexico and have accurate representation of the different land cover classes over north america with high resolution nalcms comprises 19 land cover classes and is publicly available from https www cec org tools and resources map files land cover 2010 landsat 30m 2 4 4 soil data gsde global soil dataset for earth system modelling gsde shangguan et al 2014 is based on the soil map of the world and various regional and national soil databases including soil attribute data and soil maps we used gsde because it provides comprehensive soil information globally by combining data from different sources into a harmonized product it provides soil information including soil particle size distribution organic carbon and nutrients etc there are 11 types of soil general information and 34 soil properties for eight depths the dataset is provided at 30arc seconds resolution 1 km and can be downloaded from https globalchange bnu edu cn research soilw download the watflood model is the only model that used another soil data product surficial geology of canada dataset geological survey of canada 2014 this dataset was used because it allowed for easier parameterization of the watflood model and consistency with past practises 2 5 model calibration and evaluation for streamflow the simulation period selected for this study was from 2000 to 2017 which was consistent with the availability of rdrs v2 forcing this period also encompassed significant wet and dry cycles across the ncrb and is of interest to the practitioners participating in this study we used a hydrological year for the model simulation october to september the period from jan 2000 to sep 2000 was used for model spin up which is a relatively dry period bonsal et al 2013 and can facilitate model spin up and initialization ahmed et al 2021 2020a the period from oct 2000 to sep 2011 was used for calibration which included the 2011 flooding event and the early 2000 s droughts extending across the ncrb domain including such variability high and low flow events in the calibration period is known to improve the process of model parameters identification singh and bárdossy 2012 especially in that region ahmed et al 2021 2020a the period from oct 2011 to sep 2017 was used for validation and was a relatively wet period median kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 for streamflow simulation computed at a daily time scale and at the specific watersheds used in each model was used for model calibration each model was calibrated independently by its respective modelling group to fit observed streamflow only during the calibration period we chose the median over the mean kge to reduce the effects of outlier stations i e watersheds stations with exceptionally poor performance on the calibration process the simulated hydrographs uncalibrated models of phase 0 and calibrated models of phase 1 were investigated separately for each watershed and model using the kge performance metric kge was selected for streamflow evaluation since it gives a more comprehensive assessment of bias and timing error between the simulated hydrograph and observed record knoben et al 2019 showed that simulations with a kge score 0 3 are considered acceptable behavioral which is roughly equivalent to the commonly used behavioral nse score 0 5 for daily streamflow values we divided the acceptable behavioral range of kge score suggested by knoben et al 2019 0 3 1 0 into three equal sections to represent acceptable good and excellent flow simulation table 2 any simulation with kge score 0 3 is considered unacceptable the streamflow performance of each model at the simulated watersheds was depicted as a spatial map which shows the actual location of the watershed outlet flow gauge and or box and whisker plots a detailed description of the box and whisker plots is provided in the supplemental file section s6 2 6 evaluation of model fidelity through model verifications 2 6 1 overview of data and aggregation approach the goal of these analyses was to explore reasons why model performance varies in reproducing the hydrology of the ncrb region verification of hydrological processes state and flux estimates within the models specifically actual evapotranspiration aet and snow water equivalent swe was used to assess the fidelity of the participating models these model outputs were used for verification only with no calibration as the models were calibrated to fit streamflow only given the limited observational datasets available for model fidelity assessment reanalysis products for aet and swe comparison were used here for model verification the reasons for this are two fold first actual point observations especially aet are extremely limited and are not well distributed across the ncrb figure s2 and figure s4 this would limit the comparison to specific areas regions and may introduce problems when aggregating observations to the watershed scale especially for large watersheds with limited point data that could fail to represent the watershed average conditions second these data do not typically cover the full simulation period and or they are intermittent particularly swe observations the reanalysis products used in this study showed good performance compared to the available observations supplemental file section s3 since there are issues when comparing essentially one reanalysis with another hydrological model we note that given that the reanalysis is usually based on some basic data assimilation procedures for the land surface simulations with optimally interpolated values the comparison is reasonable also it is important to note that we used independent reanalysis information from the fifth generation european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf re analysis era5 and global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam as noted below the verification datasets reanalysis products are available at different spatiotemporal scales it was necessary to unify the scale across these datasets and match each candidate model s outputs to evaluate its performance both the verification datasets and model outputs are aggregated to a temporal daily time scale and the spatial discretization scale of the given model watershed for lumped models sub watershed for semi distributed vector based models grid for semi distributed grid based model then performance metrics were calculated at that spatiotemporal scale this was necessary given that the pre defined geospatial resolution for each model varies substantially the delineated watersheds boundary might be different for different models and we chose the native resolution for land based fluxes and states because the purpose here is not to compare models against each other rather understand why they succeed fail this was done also to avoid disadvantaging lumped models since they cannot produce spatially variable states fluxes performance by ecozone facilitated identifying any of the model structural deficiencies since each ecozone is dominated by specific hydrological processes controls e g pothole dynamics in the prairies vegetation dynamics in boreal plains etc pearson correlation coefficient r was used as the performance metric to compare the performance of the model simulations to the benchmark verification data at the aforementioned spatiotemporal scale of aggregation the evaluation period is different for different variables and are listed below for both aet and swe we used r to measure the correlation and check if the models are capturing the correct pattern since there might be differences in the actual values of the reanalysis products because they are not actual field measurements kge was not favored since its use implies that the used benchmark data are actual observations which is not the case as mentioned earlier the reanalysis products were used as surrogates of the actual conditions and therefore r was used for that purpose however kge analysis is presented in the supplemental file section s5 1 and section s5 2 for aet and swe respectively to give an additional indication of the overall performance and goodness of fit of the simulated timeseries a behavioral threshold of 0 7 for r is used here to distinguish poor simulation any model with median r across its discretized computational units spatial resolution watershed sub watershed or grid 0 7 is considered acceptable and is capturing the process evaluated aet or swe reasonably the behavioral range of r 0 7 1 identified from mai et al 2022 was divided into three equal sections similar to kge to represent acceptable good and excellent flow simulation table 2 spatial maps and or box and whiskers plots were used to show the different models performance with regard to aet and swe supplemental file section s5 2 6 2 actual evapotranspiration gleam the gleam martens et al 2017 https www gleam eu reanalysis product v3 5b was used as benchmark data for aet gleam is a global dataset that contains estimates of the different components of evaporative fluxes gleam uses the priestley taylor equation based on air temperature and net radiation to calculate evaporative fluxes gleam is driven by remote sensing observations to constrain the calculated potential evaporation rates martens et al 2017 the data are available at a daily time resolution from 2003 to 2017 on a 0 25 degree grid globally actual evapotranspiration rates from gleam e variable from v3 5b dataset mm day were cropped to the ncrb domain and were used to assess the models realism in simulating evapotranspiration amounts the gleam aet product was used for this study because it showed good performance when compared against actual point observations supplemental file section s3 1 and was proven to be more accurate than other reanalysis products e g modis and era interim jia et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 the aet evaluation period is set from jan 2003 to sep 2017 which is the period with both gleam data and model outputs overlapping 2 6 3 snow water equivalent era5 land era5 land balsamo et al 2015 is a reanalysis product that provides multiple land variables by reanalyzing and combining land components of the era5 atmospheric model with ground observations the data include meteorological variables as well as other hydrological fluxes storages for the entire globe we used the snow depth water equivalent sd variable in the dataset meters for swe evaluation the data are available at an hourly time resolution from 1950 to present at a 0 1 degree grid globally the data were cropped to the ncrb boundary for the simulation period and aggregated to daily average values to be used for model evaluation the era5 land swe product was used for this study because it showed good performance when compared against actual point observations and against other remote sensing reanalysis products e g globsnow v3 supplemental file section s3 2 also era5 land was found to be accurate over other parts in canada great lakes mai et al 2022 era5 land data were downloaded from https doi org 10 24381 cds e2161bac the swe evaluation period was set from oct 2000 to sep 2017 which is the period with both era5 land data and model outputs overlapping 3 results 3 1 streamflow performance phase 0 fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of kge for all simulated watersheds for each model using an uncalibrated model setup phase 0 for the simulation period not surprisingly most of the models showed poor performance for the simulated watersheds chosen by the different modelling groups the three different models set up through the raven modelling framework blended lumped raven hypr and raven uwfs showed the lowest kge median score across the candidate models with wide distribution of kge values hype and vic showed kge scores closer to zero but hype exhibited a wide range of kge across the simulated watersheds compared to vic the swat giw model showed relatively better performance with median kge of 0 22 and narrow kge distribution watflood and hec hms showed the best performance across the different models with median kge of 0 48 and 0 57 respectively poor performance across all models was expected especially with conceptual models since these models were not calibrated and performance was tied to how the modellers set the uncalibrated initial values of the parameters for example the blended lumped parameters for this phase were set using the average value of the feasible parameter space table s2 other models e g hype vic raven hypr and raven uwfs used random values for parameters from the feasible parameters space or based on previous model setups in other domains however hec hms watflood and swat giw parameters were set based on prior knowledge and experience within this study domain these models were implemented by provincial agencies or consulting firms working in this region with a good understanding of the area and several years of continuous model development their knowledge and experience of the area and use of previously existing parameter values from models developed in this region using different setups contributed to a reasonable simulation of flow even in the phase 0 experiment finally those models with flow estimates using one sample i e one watershed cannot be expected to do well given the sample size 3 2 streamflow performance phase 1 the calibration process improved the performance of all models for both the calibration fig 4 and validation periods fig 5 compared to the uncalibrated model performance fig 3 and figure s9 for the calibration period fig 4 the blended lumped watflood and hec hms models exhibited the strongest performance across candidate models with median kge of 0 79 0 81 and 0 81 respectively most simulated watersheds 65 had good to excellent kge scores 0 53 1 seen from the spatial plot and the narrower boxplot range within each panel fig 4 the blended lumped model had relatively poor performance over a few watersheds within the prairie ecozone models that have some form of non contributing area physics e g swat giw raven hypr and raven uwfs showed relatively good performance median kge 0 50 over a small number of prairie ecozone watersheds 2 watersheds out of 132 selected watersheds the vic model also had reasonable performance over its simulated watersheds in the northern manitoba boreal shield ecozone median kge of 0 43 and performed poorly for a couple of watersheds near the most downstream portion of the lower nelson subbasin in the hudson bay lowlands hudson plain ecozone hype showed reasonable simulation of the flows across all 132 watersheds with a median kge of 0 46 but the model had a wide range of kge fig 4 hype showed unacceptable flow simulation performance across the prairies central part of the saskatchewan river and entire assiniboine river kge 0 3 while it showed reasonable to good performance elsewhere the performance of blended lumped and the prairie models swat giw raven hypr raven uwfs decreased significantly median kge reduced by almost 0 3 for the validation period fig 5 relative to the calibration period fig 4 in general the performance of the rest of the models also decreased median kge but not as significantly a large discrepancy between calibration and validation performance can be a sign of parameters that are overfit to the calibration period hype almost maintained the same performance compared to the calibration period overall watflood and hec hms models showed the best performance during the validation period with median kges of 0 69 and 0 66 respectively however this must be considered carefully given the limited number of watersheds mostly non prairie in these setups relative to other models that ran a larger subset of watersheds over multiple ecozones blended lumped and hype showed acceptable simulation during validation with median kges of 0 53 and 0 43 respectively given that they simulated a large number of watersheds including the difficult regions fig 5 vic and swat giw showed borderline acceptable simulation with kges of 0 32 and 0 34 respectively while the rest of the models had unacceptable flow simulation during the validation period median kge 0 3 it is generally difficult to predict streamflow of watersheds in the prairie ecozone table s10 accurately across all different models fig 6 shows the distribution of kge for the different ecozones during the calibration and validation period for the candidate models the decrease in kge scores for the validation period compared to the calibration is noticeable for almost all models model performance for both the calibration and validation periods was acceptable across the different ecozones for almost all models median kge 0 3 except for the prairies and hudson plain watersheds table s10 at which models showed either unacceptable or lower performance compared to other ecozones especially during the validation period the exception is the hec hms model that showed good performance for the two prairie watersheds it simulated the contributing area for these basins is large and they are located in downstream portions of the prairie ecozone therefore they are not significantly dominated impacted by the prairie fill and spill dynamics which makes it relatively easier to model fig 4 and fig 5 hype showed a wider range of kge with unacceptable median performance for both the calibration and validation periods over prairie watersheds hype also showed lower kge performance over the hudson plain when compared to other ecozones simulated by the same model this can also be concluded for the blended lumped where lower kge scores over the hudson plain compared to other ecozones are apparent especially during the validation period the vic model had difficulties in replicating flows over the same area hudson plains are dominated by discontinuous to continuous permafrost flat landscapes with poorly to undefined drainage networks and numerous wetlands depressions and lakes ecological framework of canada 1999 which make it similarly dominated by the fill and spill mechanism like the prairie region these dominant and dynamic hydrological controls are typically not at all or only poorly represented in hydrological models which makes it challenging to get accurate simulation of the flow at that area to perform a cross comparison among models while accounting for the limited number of coincident watershed locations models were compared at overlapping watersheds fig 7 shows the median kge comparison for each model at coincident watersheds simulated by other models for both the calibration and validation periods for illustration for the calibration period median kge of the hype model at overlapping watersheds with the blended lumped model common 119 watersheds stations between the two models is 0 47 while the median kge for blended lumped at common watersheds with hype same 119 stations mentioned earlier is 0 79 fig 7 a cross comparison of the models performance at common watersheds showed that they had relatively acceptable performance during the calibration period fig 7 blended lumped showed the best performance during the calibration period compared to other models and it simulated most of the watersheds 119 out of 132 in the study area fig 7 watflood and hec hms models showed the best performance over the limited number of eight and four watersheds simulated respectively when compared to the same watersheds simulated by other models hype blended lumped and vic hype showed overall acceptable performance across the largest subset of watersheds when compared to other models however it showed poor performance across the prairie watershed e g lewis creek in the saskatchewan river basin that was simulated by both raven hypr and raven uwfs fig 7 this is expected since hype does not include a non contributing area prairie module to simulate the dynamic fill and spill mechanism the same conclusions are realized in the validation period fig 7 the performance of blended lumped decreased in validation same as concluded by fig 6 but still showed acceptable simulation performance in 78 of watersheds except for the three prairie watersheds that were successfully simulated by hec hms raven hypr and raven uwfs hype s performance remained acceptable for 61 of the simulated watersheds and it struggled at the same three prairie watersheds that were successfully simulated by hec hms raven hypr and raven uwfs although hype showed significant errors when simulating the same one watershed as raven hypr and raven uwfs in the calibration period the model was able to simulate its flow reasonably acceptably in the validation period this likely occurred because the validation period is wetter on average in those watersheds and the potholes remain full and the landscape drainage network connected i e no dramatic changes in contributing area in this period and the lake module of hype was able to produce reasonable streamflow in wet periods during drier years where the landscape disconnects from the main drainage network hype has not been able to adequately simulate runoff therefore the lake module of hype is insufficient for simulating prairie region runoff dynamics across a range of hydrological conditions it failed in most prairie watershed fig 5 3 3 model fidelity of phase 1 3 3 1 aet simulation the distribution of the pearson correlation coefficient r between the benchmark and simulated aet at the simulation scale watershed for lumped models and sub watershed for semi distributed models for the candidate models is plotted in fig 8 for each ecozone overall models showed acceptable performance in simulating evaporative fluxes at the simulation scale over the different ecozones as indicated by the distribution and median correlation coefficient value r 0 7 fig 8 hype showed good aet simulation with median correlation of 0 8 and narrow distribution across the different ecozones including the prairies the raven hypr model showed poor performance in simulating aet over the one prairie watershed modelled however the other raven model configuration raven uwfs showed excellent aet simulation of r 0 90 over the same watershed although the blended lumped model performed well in the overall simulation of lumped aet it struggled over the prairie region also noticeable in the spatial distribution of correlation for the watersheds modelled figure s11 with unacceptable median correlation value and wider range of the distribution of the correlation values watflood showed unacceptable aet for all simulated grids within the boreal shield ecozone fig 8 and figure s11 raven hypr overestimated aet in the lewis creek prairie watersheds modelled the blended lumped model showed poor correlation coefficient and had significant errors in estimating aet amounts over and or under estimation timing and or a combination of both in 42 out of 61 simulated prairie watersheds this suggests that the models generated erroneous aet values to achieve a reasonable simulation of streamflow the same conclusions can be drawn from kge analysis figure s12 this was expected since correlation constitutes a significant portion of the kge metric however the only exception is the watflood model which showed good aet simulation as indicated by median kge over the boreal shield ecozone the correlation between the simulated aet by watflood and the benchmark aet data was relatively poor fig 8 and therefore more efforts might be needed to investigate how the model simulated aet see table s9 for detailed description of models structure and process representation 3 3 2 swe simulation fig 9 shows the distribution of the pearson correlation coefficient r between the benchmarked era5 land and the simulated swe for the different discretization scale for each model of phase 1 experiment for the full simulation period swat giw was not included in this analysis due to difficulty in retrieving its swe simulations from model outputs overall most models showed excellent daily swe simulation from oct 2000 to sep 2017 with median r 0 9 across the different ecozones hype showed excellent overall simulation of swe with median of 0 95 and relatively narrow distribution of r even though it was compared at a finer scale sub watershed level compared to the rest of the models watershed scale except watflood blended lumped and hec hms also showed excellent performance with median r of 0 94 for both models with the former model being applied to much larger subset of watersheds compared to the latter however the two models set up within the raven modelling framework raven hypr and raven uwfs showed unacceptable swe simulation over the simulated watershed in the prairies with median r of 0 28 and 0 27 respectively spatial plot figure s13 in summary the models showed relatively good simulation of swe amounts when looking at r and kge values fig 9 and figure s14 respectively suggesting that the snow dynamics in the models are working reasonably well 4 discussion 4 1 on the relationship between streamflow process representation and modelled area the uncalibrated models phase 0 fig 3 resulted in unacceptable streamflow performance which is anticipated when using random parameter sets to represent a hydrologically unique and complex environment however proper parameter values inferred from prior knowledge any past modelling experiments or setups in the region of interest or based on knowledge of the actual hydrological conditions in the basin can improve uncalibrated model performance and lead to reasonable simulation results e g watflood and hec hms models phase 0 fig 3 however the calibration process improved the performance of all participating models when compared to the uncalibrated version figure s9 with all models showing acceptable to good performance during the calibration period the performance of the blended lumped model improved significantly after calibration because the parameters of the uncalibrated model were set using the average value of the feasible parameter space table s2 which contributed to its poor performance for phase 0 as the parameters did not reflect the actual conditions of the simulated watersheds again as anticipated model performance declined during the validation period except for hype over the different areas of the ncrb among the models that simulated all or a large subset of the selected watersheds blended lumped showed good overall flow simulation while the hype model showed acceptable overall performance in simulating the entire domain other models e g watflood and hec hms showed good streamflow simulation but at limited watersheds blended lumped is a lumped and locally calibrated model i e a unique parameter set is obtained for each watershed which gave it additional degrees of freedom during calibration and resulted in an improved simulation of streamflow over almost all simulated watersheds locally calibrated models typically outperform regional and global models mai et al 2022 similar behavior was found here in the good performance of blended lumped relative to other models the performance of the locally calibrated models might diminish in the validation but such models are easier to set up and calibrate compared to regional and global models mai et al 2022 hype is a global model which means it applied one global parameter set to simulate the entire region which here was 132 watersheds this had limited hype s ability to better replicate the streamflow at each individual watershed but resulted in a more stable calibration validation approach i e little to no deterioration in streamflow performance for the different periods fig 6 models showed unacceptable performance or struggled over watersheds dominated by numerous potholes lakes e g the prairies and hudson plain fig 6 that result in disconnected and dynamic drainage networks despite the models having reasonable performance in the prairie region over the calibration period their performance deteriorated in validation or reduced more significantly than other ecozones suggesting the model calibrations were not as robust and that the models structurally are unable to represent the complex dynamics of dis connecting between the potholes and their influence on streamflow generation two prairie specific models e g raven hypr and raven uwfs showed poor performance in the validation period across one prairie watershed while the third prairie model swat giw showed borderline acceptable simulation in the validation period fig 5 which may suggest that the representation of the potholes and non contributing area dynamics within these models remain insufficient or the vertical water budgets estimates are poorly simulated currently available non contributing area modules may not replicate the hysteretic and non linear response of prairie watersheds which leads to unsuccessful flow simulation ahmed et al 2021 this needs further investigation for these models analysis of the aet flux showed that the blended lumped model had severe discrepancies in estimating the lumped aet mainly overestimation fig 8 likely to compensate for the missing pothole representation water storage dynamics and to achieve adequate streamflow performance since there is no contributing area dynamics module inside the model the calibration facilitated the removal of portions of runoff that should have been stored in the depressions in the form of evaporative fluxes to get reasonable flow simulation watflood model also produced good streamflow simulation but relatively poor aet simulation over the boreal shield ecozone when looking at correlation coefficient fig 8 however it showed good kge simulation overall aet simulation figure s12 parameter equifinality in calibration might contribute to the poor aet correlation performance from watflood and more investigation might be needed to revisit how watflood simulated aet these are examples of a model that is giving the right answer for the wrong reason where the calibration process achieved strong streamflow simulation at the cost of aet simulation kirchner 2006 hype had unacceptable streamflow simulation over the prairies fig 6 but very good simulation of the evaporative fluxes fig 8 hype could not replicate prairie runoff generation and streamflow even when calibrated because it does not have a non contributing area pothole module the calibration process did not affect aet process simulation of hype this has happened likely because hype used a global parameter set which might have reduced the effects of parameter overfitting to achieve a reasonable calibration target streamflow another possible reason is that hype used the modified hargreaves samani method which is an empirical method that also showed relatively reasonable aet simulation for other models in this study hec hms and watflood table s9 most of the models showed relatively good simulation of swe amounts over the various ecozones suggesting that the snow dynamics in the models are working reasonably well fig 9 and figure s14 however the raven hypr and raven uwfs models showed unacceptable swe simulation over the one simulated watershed in the prairies spatial plot figure s13 the models used the simplified temperature index approach for snow dynamics simulation this approach relies heavily on calibration since it is difficult to link its parameters to actual physical meanings or measurements and therefore it can easily produce unrealistic simulation of swe amounts to arrive at a successful flow simulation right answer for the wrong reason there is some evidence to suggest the models are also missing proper representations of wetland fens and bogs dynamics across the boreal plain and boreal shield regions table s9 but they are still able to achieve acceptable streamflow fig 6 and aet fig 8 performance hype has a simple wetland dynamics module which may have led to improving aet flux estimates it is known that wetland dynamics significantly influence streamflow amount and timing price et al 2005 however hydrological models with no proper representation of wetland dynamics have been shown to accurately simulate streamflow reasonably in this region previously davison et al 2016 further analysis for example using soil moisture observations or total water storage in watersheds is needed to investigate the importance of these features in simulating the hydrological cycle over that region 4 2 benchmarking streamflow model performance across ncrb establishing a reference kge threshold to distinguish behavioral from non behavioral simulations has been quite a subjective topic over the past decade different studies have suggested different kge benchmark values kling et al 2012 knoben et al 2019 mai et al 2022 largely without any consideration of the complexities of the area being modelled moreover review of the prairie hydrological modelling literature reveals that many models have historically struggled to achieve equal or even satisfactory performance across the prairies stadnyk et al 2020 there is therefore an interest in establishing a baseline benchmark for expected model performance in this region for practitioners and the academic hydrological community we selected a constant acceptable performance threshold value kge 0 3 suggested in the literature by knoben et al 2019 re examining this threshold by considering distinct ecozones however suggests a much lower benchmark kge value is achievable for the prairie ecozone relative to other regions an ensemble of kge values achieved by the different models in nelson mip over the simulation period of the phase 1 experiment is provided in fig 10 we used the mean value over median to reflect the difficulty in simulating each zone by including outliers watersheds with poor performance which are common across ncrb especially in the prairies the range of kge scores for each ecozone is relatively narrow except for the prairies and hudson plain ecozones fig 10 application of the two sided wilcoxon rank sum test to each pair of ecozones based on the ensemble kge values for each ecozone showed statistically significant differences between the prairies versus the boreal plain ecozone p value 6 26 10 5 the prairies versus the boreal shield ecozone p value 1 24 10 4 and the prairies versus the western cordillera ecozone p value 5 00 10 3 fig 11 therefore the prairies showed a significantly lower kge value than these other three regions fig 10 no other pair of ecozones showed significant differences with this test p values 5 00 10 2 fig 11 which is unsurprising given the extremely small sample size for the other ecozones involved in these tests taiga shield and hudson plain all have 10 or fewer data points fig 10 the mean value of the ensemble kge from all models remains above the 0 3 threshold however the prairies on average were not able to achieve the same mean score having a lower mean 0 17 compared to other ecozones fig 10 these results demonstrate a lower benchmark kge for prairie watersheds should be expected in future studies and suggest an acceptable model performance threshold of kge 0 17 should be used across the prairies it is important to note that advances in incorporating proper prairie pothole and non contributing area dynamics into models could improve this benchmark in future studies this shows that reference kge values can vary by ecozone presumably due to hydrological complexity and features that may cause models to struggle in simulating that region and should not be set to a fixed number 4 3 nelson mip project benefits challenges and insights model intercomparison studies have been criticized for the lack of reproducibility and transparency clark et al 2011 hutton et al 2016 peel and mcmahon 2020 mainly for two reasons the first is that most of the studies compare the performance of the aggregated model output streamflow which limits the scientific community s knowledge of how the different process representation affects the results the second is that model failures are not typically reported in such studies however in this study we evaluated the performance of the models with respect to streamflow simulation and other internal hydrological variables aet and swe and we were transparent about model failures in the different aspects like the previous impc model intercomparison studies grip e mai et al 2021 and grip gl mai et al 2022 we also made all the used dataset e g observed benchmark data and model results publicly available ahmed et al 2023 https uc hal github io projects html nelson mip all of this helps in better informing the scientific community about the structural differences of the participating models and would give scientists and practitioners the ability to further explore the outputs results of this study model intercomparison projects mips are useful for researchers and practitioners since they provide scientific and practical knowledge in this study we were able to identify that the models need proper representation of non contributing area dynamics to replicate prairie runoff generation and streamflow without this enhanced structural representation models produce unacceptable long term performance of either streamflow or hydrological processes even if the model is well calibrated the nelson mip study is useful to practitioners and policy makers as it tests a wide range of different hydrological models and model configurations commonly used within the ncrb we could not make a solid basin wide assessment about the different participating models with regards to streamflow and internal hydrological variable simulations since the different models were tested on different subsets of the selected watershed limited areas with only two models running large subset of the watersheds continental scale application of hydrological models even in hydrologically complex regions presents an advantage for water resources practitioners and management such that results can support water supply allocation and assessment of regional water loss improvements in non contributing area runoff generation dynamics are needed for models being applied to the prairie region for them to provide accurate predictions of long term water loss and streamflow generation intercomparison projects require significant amounts of effort to be completed with little reward a lesson learned from this study is that it is difficult to find hydrologists who can dedicate the time and resources over several years to participate in such projects especially over large scale domains available resources funding computing power time etc are limited and therefore they have been preventing hydrologists from participating in this study available resources modellers interest and prior knowledge of certain areas play a significant role in selecting which watersheds to simulate in such studies when hydrologists participate in mips they prefer to include scope areas or research questions of interest to them therefore it may be challenging to do more of these studies in the future unless appropriate resources are made available to facilitate building the models codes workflows to facilitate building and running the models knoben et al 2022 some of the challenges of the study are as follows 1 most models ran a subset of the selected watersheds which prevented us from making a basin wide assessment of the different models 2 the vastness and diverse nature of the ncrb creates practical challenges for modellers 3 research should continue to strive to bring modelling groups together to collaborate share experiences and ultimately improve understanding of the complex hydrology within the ncrb a call for project participants was released and limited resource support through students and computational support was made available regular monthly meetings with project participants were scheduled to discuss the experimental setup of the study track the progress of modelling effort and to provide technical and computing support if needed fig 1 even with the offered support only parties and modellers with a vested interest in the ncrb region and water supply were able to be involved except the raven modelling team who received funding through gwf for this project this region is also well known as a difficult region to model which have deterred some modelling groups presumably out of fear of how their models would be represented within the study the goal of this study however was not to rank models or compare outcomes but to learn from what the models collective did well and what they were not capable of doing as well we tried to avoid the question of how good a model is and instead focus on what a particular model may be good or not for this points to one of the prevailing challenges of mips in general the perception that model rank somehow infers or is directly transferable to model uptake in other studies across other domains clark et al 2011 this should not be and is not the main message or rationale for conducting this intercomparison study the real value in the nelson mip project is the idea of generating an ensemble of models to simulate the hydrology of the ncrb such that uncertainty bounds benchmarking standards and future ensembles of projected water supply can be elucidated the limited overlapping domain of the phase 1 experiment limits this ideal application however still affords some measure of model performance benchmarking and uncertainty and provides the framework datasets and methods of comparison that will facilitate the inclusion of more models in the future to help in generating more reliable ensemble of models simulation 5 conclusion the performance of eight hydrological models was compared over different headwater and unregulated watersheds in the nelson churchill river basin in north america most of the models ran on a small subset 10 of the selected watersheds 132 watersheds in total based on available resources of the participating modelling team except for hype which modelled all 132 watersheds and blended lumped which modelled 119 of the 132 watersheds a brief overview of the outcomes and answers to the addressed research questions of this study is shown in table 3 further some of the main findings of this paper are as follows 1 most models had difficulties in replicating prairie streamflow due to either missing or simplified representation of the non contributing area dynamics one model hec hms had good results over two prairie watersheds simulated but this might have happened because the watersheds are not significantly dominated by non contributing areas 2 the analysis showed that some models provided reasonable streamflow simulation in the prairies at the cost of aet simulation right answer for the wrong reason mostly due to the missing or poor representation of the non contributing area dynamics 3 swe analysis showed that the snow dynamics are very well represented in most participating models 4 current model s kge streamflow performance is expected to be approximately 0 17 over the prairies indicating the importance of a continued research focus on improving the behavioral performance in regions affected by dynamic non contributing areas 5 several models performed good to excellent in streamflow simulation within the boreal plain boreal shield taiga shield and western cordillera ecozones this study has both scientific and practical outcomes as it can guide future model development in the complex region and provides insights on the models performance in that area practitioners can use this study to highlight useful models for their modelling purposes streamflow and or hydrological flux simulations which can improve management of available water resources and provide more water and food security for future generations efforts are currently being made to move to phase 2 of the project at which the same participating models performance is tested on regulated watersheds this will help in further validating the ability of the models to produce regulated streamflow and can highlight further areas where model structural improvements are needed more efforts are also needed to assess the models accuracy in estimating other flow signatures e g peak flow and low flows mehr and kahya 2017 credit

1752,intercomparison studies play an important but limited role in understanding the usefulness and limitations of currently available hydrological models comparison studies are often limited to well behaved hydrological regimes where rainfall runoff processes dominate the hydrological response these efforts have not covered western canada due to the difficulty in simulating that region s complex cold region hydrology with varying spatiotemporal contributing areas this intercomparison study is the first of a series of studies under the intercomparison project of the international and interprovincial transboundary nelson churchill river basin ncrb in north america nelson mip which encompasses different ecozones with major areas of the non contributing prairie potholes forests glaciers mountains and permafrost the performance of eight hydrological and land surface models is compared at different unregulated watersheds within the ncrb this is done to assess the models streamflow performance and overall fidelity without and with calibration to capture the underlying physics of the region and to better understand why models struggle to accurately simulate its hydrology results show that some of the participating models have difficulties in simulating streamflow and or internal hydrological variables e g evapotranspiration over prairie watersheds but most models performed well elsewhere this stems from model structural deficiencies despite the various models being well calibrated to observed streamflow some model structural changes are identified for

of the hydrological cycle maxwell et al 2014 they are used to predict various hazards to communities around the globe i e floods and droughts and are extensively relied on for managing available water resources arheimer et al 2020 hanasaki et al 2018 2006 hydrological models have different approaches to represent physical processes that may dominate the hydrological cycle in a region conceptual empirical mathematical and physical in different ways geospatially across various spatial scales lumped semi distributed and distributed these models typically require meteorological forcing using observations or modelled reanalysis datasets geospatial fields for basin or sub basin characterization and a method for estimating their parameters which vary based on the type and complexity of the model hrachowitz and clark 2017 model intercomparison studies have garnered considerable interest in the past few decades due to the widespread availability and accessibility of different hydrological models within the community such studies are conducted to 1 identify a set of models that have accurate representation of the hydrological variable s of interest mostly streamflow and to 2 inform the scientific communities on the advantages and disadvantages of the currently available hydrological models best et al 2015 de boer euser et al 2017 huang et al 2017 kollet et al 2017 mai et al 2022 2021 smith et al 2004 tijerina et al 2021 vetter et al 2015 most of the conducted intercomparison studies investigated the performance of the models summative output streamflow with fewer looking at model fidelity model storages and fluxes using historical simulation periods while others investigate the differences between models projections under future climates e g krysanova et al 2020 2017 such studies mostly focus on well established and or well instrumented major river basins around the globe e g blue nile mississippi amazon ganges rhine etc or parts of southern north america conterminous united states krysanova et al 2017 with less attention on major cold regions basins such as those found in many parts of canada past model intercomparison studies in canada have mainly focused on the more temperate parts of the country namely the laurentian great lakes region erie huron michigan ontario and superior in eastern canada references provided below these studies were conducted by researchers and practitioners from canada the united states and europe to better simulate the streamflow in this highly populated and important transboundary river basin early attempts focused on simulating each one of the great lakes and its contributing watersheds separately within the great lakes runoff intercomparison project grip series the lake watersheds studies are lake michigan grip m fry et al 2014 lake ontario grip o gaborit et al 2017 and lake erie grip e mai et al 2021 recently the integrated modelling program for canada impc as part of the global water futures gwf initiative https gwf usask ca has established the great lakes runoff inter comparison project for the great lakes area grip gl mai et al 2022 the grip gl project formalized a standardized experimental setup unified meteorological and geophysical inputs streamflow calibration and validation stations auxiliary evaluation variables hydrological routing parameter transfer approach and comparison approach of model outputs and reference datasets for streamflow and auxiliary variables to compare the performance of 13 streamflow simulation models data driven and land surface models in terms of streamflow simulation and other auxiliary hydrological variables snow water equivalent surface soil moisture actual evapotranspiration over the entire great lakes area mai et al 2022 the grip gl study identified a set of models that have shown better performance in simulating streamflow and other hydrological variables compared to observed benchmark data over that area another study with operational focus was conducted over three regulated watersheds in british columbia canada the study investigated the performance of four hydrological models in simulating the flow for operational hydropower purposes cunderlik et al 2013 however the study did not investigate the performance of the models with respect to other hydrological variables and their study domain with quite limited there have been few efforts to conduct intercomparison projects across western and central canada largely due to the hydrological complexity of this region this area encompasses various ecozones including major portions of the north american non contributing prairie pothole region the prairie pothole region is dominated by numerous land depressions potholes anteau et al 2016 which can retain substantial amounts of runoff and alter the streamflow shook and pomeroy 2011 van der kamp and hayashi 2009 along with the various ecozones cold region processes are dominant in that area e g blowing snow snow sublimation frozen soil infiltration etc which pose additional challenges to the hydrological simulation in that area dumanski et al 2015 pomeroy et al 2007 1993 in this region model structural adequacy studies have been limited to testing a single model with multiple configurations against its original version to assess its ability to handle the complex rainfall snowmelt to runoff transfer functions of this region e g ahmed et al 2021 2020a chu et al 2013 mekonnen et al 2016 2014 muhammad et al 2019 stadnyk et al 2020 further this area is important for canada s food security since it produces 90 of the national production of grain and oilseed valued at more than 2 billion cad annually agriculture and agri food canada 2021 to provide guidance to canada s operational and transboundary water management community it is important to create a comprehensive picture of model performance capabilities over western and central canada to better highlight the model structural deficiencies unique to this regime and across available models this helps the global community in assessing future targeted model developments and provides a framework for assessing models based on their fidelity as opposed to summative streamflow performance which is crucial for water availability projections under future climates these studies also benefit more local authorities in the management of available water resources and water allocation in that complex region and contribute towards water security for future generations as part of the impc initiative the nelson mip intercomparison project fig 1 was established to both benchmark and compare the performance of different hydrological models over a major river basin in western and central canada nelson churchill river basin ncrb fig 2 this intercomparison study is the first of a series of efforts under the nelson mip intercomparison project the main objective of this work is to compare the performance of the participating hydrological and land surface models from both academic and operational institutions across the hydrologically complex ncrb region in reproducing streamflow and other important hydrological processes to ensure model fidelity and to establish a benchmark for expected model performance thresholds a secondary objective is to highlight any necessary model structural improvements that could guide future model development in the hydrological community in this study the performance of eight hydrological and land surface models was assessed and compared at different unregulated headwater watersheds over ncrb this study presents the results of the first two phases of the nelson mip project phase 0 and 1 fig 1 in this study we address the following research questions 1 how do the different models perform in streamflow simulation without and with calibration at different unregulated watersheds in the ncrb compared to observed flow data 2 how do the different models perform in simulating internal hydrological variables at different unregulated watersheds in the ncrb compared to benchmark data 3 do the models give the right answer q1 for the right reason q2 4 why does the models performance vary across different regions ecozones in the ncrb 5 do models need structural improvement to better simulate the ncrb hydrology it is important to note that the intent here is not to compare models relative to each other rather to compare each model s own performance relative to observation benchmark data and then to discuss which ones generally perform better over the ncrb 2 methodology eight hydrological and land surface models were set up over various watersheds of the ncrb some were academic led setups while other contributions were from water resource practitioners using models that are set up for operational use within this region these models used a standardized set of input data processed and provided to all collaborators by m i ahmed to ensure proper comparison across their outputs against observations flow evapotranspiration and snow water equivalent the description of the nelson mip project ncrb study area participating models data used and comparison methodology is presented in this section 2 1 nelson mip project and its phases the nelson mip project consists of four phases phase 0 to 3 fig 1 phase 0 assesses the performance of the candidate models in producing streamflow for the full simulation period at unregulated headwater watersheds within the ncrb without calibration phase 0 is used to show how the performance of the models improves through the calibration process attempted in phase 1 phase 1 assesses the performance of the candidate models at the same watersheds as phase 0 after calibrating them to fit the streamflow the performance of the models is assessed with respect to flow calibration and validation period and other hydrological variables actual evapotranspiration and snow water equivalent full simulation period phase 2 of the project assesses the performance of the models in simulating the flow and other hydrological variables at regulated watersheds within ncrb after being calibrated to fit the flows of the regulated watersheds phase 2 is proposed to show the impact of human influence through flow regulation on the watershed hydrology phase 3 assesses the impacts of future climate change using models developed in phase 1 and phase 2 this paper focuses on phase 0 and phase 1 of the nelson mip project 2 2 study area and the selected watersheds the nelson churchill river basin in north america was selected for this study due to its regional importance given its complex and cold regions hydrological cycle its highly regulated status and water consumptive losses the reliance of prairie agriculture and hydropower generation on the basin water supply and its transboundary interprovincial and international jurisdiction fig 2 the ncrb is the third largest river basin in north america with a total area of 1 4 million km2 and an approximate non contributing area of 0 33 million km2 according to the prairie farm rehabilitation administration non contributing area map pfra fig 2 a agriculture and agri food canada 2013 the non contributing area is defined as the area that does not contribute flow to the outlet of the basin for events with 2 year return periods or smaller godwin and martin 1975 the ncrb expands from the southwestern boundary of alberta canada along the rocky mountains to hudson bay in northeastern manitoba the ncrb crosses alberta saskatchewan manitoba and ontario in canada with headwater watersheds in montana north and south dakota and minnesota in the united states fig 2 b the ncrb comprises seven major subbasins saskatchewan river basin assiniboine river basin red river basin winnipeg river basin lake winnipeg basin lower nelson river basin and the churchill river basin fig 2 a the first six major subbasins form the nelson river basin ncrb encompasses six different ecozones u s environmental protection agency 2010 namely western cordillera 2 1 prairies 36 4 boreal plain 25 4 boreal shield 31 6 taiga shield 3 6 and hudson plain 0 9 fig 2 b the prairies boreal shield and boreal plain are the dominant ecozones in the ncrb the dominant land cover types are forest 30 3 cropland 30 3 wetlands and lakes 21 2 with some patches of shrubland grassland the dominant soil types are loam 43 8 loamy sand 12 3 and clay loam 11 9 these values were identified from the used landcover and soil data in this study which are explained in section 2 4 3 and 2 4 4 below the hydrology of the ncrb is complex due to the different hydrological processes responses glaciers mountain hillslopes permafrost prairie sub arctic vegetation dynamics of the forests wetlands encountered within various ecozones especially the prairies and the high degree of regulation and development practises in the area the existence of the prairie ecozone within ncrb provides additional challenges to the hydrological simulation the prairies are well known for their flat terrain with numerous land depressions that can retain significant amounts of snowmelt and rainfall on the landscape while limiting runoff to streams ahmed et al 2020b shook and pomeroy 2011 runoff production across the prairies typically follows a fill and spill mechanism wherein a depression spills to the downstream depressions or areas after being filled shaw et al 2012 this mechanism results in a dynamic spatiotemporal non contributing area that changes based on the magnitude of net rainfall snowmelt antecedent moisture conditions of the watershed and depressional storage availability ahmed et al 2021 this complex prairie phenomenon makes most hydrological models inapplicable to modelling this region mekonnen et al 2016 2014 such that it has been coined the graveyard of hydrological models by the canadian hydrological community muhammad et al 2019 the ncrb is also dominated by numerous managed and unmanaged lake systems and reservoirs that store significant amounts of surface runoff additionally ncrb is also dominated by numerous wetlands within the boreal plain and boreal shield that have complex dynamics when interacting with surrounding areas price et al 2005 the hudson plain and parts of the taiga shield ecozones are dominated by permafrost which further adds to the complexities of the basin ecological framework of canada 1999 all of these dominant processes and hydrological features make the hydrology of the ncrb challenging a set of watersheds with reliable streamflow gauging stations were derived from the water survey of canada wsc https wateroffice ec gc ca search historical e html and united states geological survey usgs https waterdata usgs gov nwis rt databases for this study the following criteria were used to select the relevant watersheds for this study 1 watersheds with drainage area 200 km2 this was necessary to ensure the watersheds are of relatively medium to large size and to avoid small watersheds with quick flashy response mai et al 2022 2 watersheds with adequate streamflow information during the simulation period 2000 2017 set based on the availability of forcing data section 2 4 1 which was required for model calibration and evaluation where missing data were less than 25 for the period we used the 25 threshold since most of the watersheds in this region have seasonal streamflow gauges with no flow values measured during fall and winter 3 headwater watersheds with no regulated attribute in the wsc database which implies no known visible control structures within the watershed i e streamflow has not been altered by any human influence we used such watersheds to minimize the effect of human influence on the streamflow this resulted in 132 unregulated headwater watersheds in the ncrb fig 2 c covering a total area of almost 0 26 million km2 2 3 participating models eight candidate hydrological and land surface models participated in the study in response to a call for modeller participation the models are hype lindström et al 2010 blended lumped mai et al 2020b watflood kouwen et al 1993 vic liang et al 1994 hec hms us army corps of engineers 2016 swat giw muhammad et al 2018 raven hypr ahmed et al 2020a and raven uwfs taheri et al 2023 hype blended lumped vic raven hypr and raven uwfs are academically research used models form academic institutions while watflood hec hms and swat giw are operationally used models by practitioners in the region each model simulated a subset of the selected watersheds based on the investigators specific interest available resources and prior knowledge of the modelled domain figure s1 hype is the only model that simulated all watersheds in this study because its results were contributed by the leading authors of this work who had a vested interest in the ncrb who developed the experimental setup of this study and had sufficient resources to allocate for the project a brief description of the models is presented in this section and in table 1 a detailed description of the calibrated parameters and their ranges the calibration budget the used algorithm for each dominant process and the simulated watersheds domain for each model is provided in the supplemental file section s1 the models are listed in a descending order based on their simulation area used in the study following the same naming convention used in the grip gl project mai et al 2022 models are classified as local regional or global a local model is defined as a model that has a unique model setup and set of parameters for each simulated watershed a regional model is defined as a model that has a model setup for each major basin in the study e g churchill river assiniboine river saskatchewan river etc or if the model is simulating a subset of the watersheds but using one model setup a global model is one that has only one setup and one parameter set for the full domain the models were also classified based on their spatial resolution as lumped or semi distributed and based on their process representation as conceptual or semi physical combination of conceptual empirical and physical equations table 1 and table s9 2 3 1 hype the hydrological predictions for the environment hype lindström et al 2010 model is a free and open source hydrological model that allows for simulating the different hydrological processes precipitation phase change glaciers snow processes evaporation infiltration runoff wetland and lake dynamics irrigation abstractions regulation tracers etc hype is a semi distributed vector based model which requires the physiographic and meteorological information at the sub basin scale hype uses multiple conceptual empirical and or physical approaches to solve the different hydrological cycle component lindström et al 2010 and the user must set which approach is used to calculate each process when running the model hype discretizes sub basins into different soil and landcover classes slcs computational units similar to the hydrologic response units hrus and it discretizes the soil into three layers by default hype runs on a daily time resolution by default but can run on a sub daily resolution to calculate the hydrological fluxes at the slc scale the results are averaged later to provide sub basin average values hype cannot simulate the prairie pothole dynamics which are dominant over the ncrb in this study hype used a temperature and radiation index method for snowmelt calculations which allowed hype to perform calculations to change snow density precipitation phase change and snow sublimation hype simulated glaciers and thawing and freezing of the soil column hype calculated infiltration as a function of soil storage evapotranspiration was calculated using the modified hargreaves samani method water bodies or wetlands were handled as a lumped lake or lumped wetland within each sub basin and their outflow was calculated using a rating curve method surface runoff was calculated using runoff coefficients and soil water threshold for this study hype simulated all watersheds involved and therefore it was built in a global setup i e one model setup for all watersheds the hype model was built to simulate the entire ncrb to allow it to explore more watersheds in the future but it was deployed calibrated validated at the selected watersheds only 2 3 2 blended lumped the blended lumped model is a hydrological model that was introduced by mai et al 2020 and is defined within the raven hydrological modelling framework craig et al 2020 the blended lumped model uses the weighted average of several chosen process implementations for key processes to simulate streamflow instead of using one single parametrization per process as an example a simplified blended model could define any single hydrological process flux fprocess1 as 1 f p r o c e s s 1 x w w d 1 d 1 w d 2 d 2 with 2 w d 1 w d 2 1 where d 1 and d 2 could be for instance two options or algorithms for one process for example infiltration options could be the infiltration algorithm of hmets d 1 and the infiltration algorithm of hbv d 2 the infiltration outputs d 1 and d 2 are then weighted using w d 1 and w d 2 to compute the raven infiltration flux for the corresponding timestep a complete blended model can include many different weighted process flux equations up to one per process simulated in the model a detailed description of all blended model processes and process options as well as a model flowchart can be found in the supplementary material of mai et al 2020b and in the raven documentation craig 2022 the blended model uses three different options for the infiltration process three options for quick flow two options for evaporation two options for baseflow and three options for snow balance all other processes i e convolution of surface runoff and delayed runoff potential melt percolation rain snow partitioning and precipitation correction were used with one fixed process option the model was set up in lumped mode and simulated 119 basins in total the 13 of the 132 basins not modelled were excluded due to their area being smaller than 300 km2 instead of the threshold of 200 km2 applied for the other basins this was due to an oversight at the beginning of the setup and was not possible to be corrected due to limited resources for this project the model used a daily time step to simulate streamflow and all internal variables and was setup and calibrated for each watershed individually locally calibrated 2 3 3 watflood watflood is a free and open source hydrological model that allows for simulating interception evaporation transpiration snow accumulation and sublimation snowmelt glaciers infiltration interflow recharge baseflow and overland channel and wetland routing watflood is a semi distributed model which requires the physiographic and meteorological information at a grid scale watflood uses conceptual empirical and physical approaches to solve the different hydrological cycle components kouwen et al 1993 watflood discretizes grids into different grus grouped response units and it discretizes the soil into two layers watflood runs on an hourly time resolution to calculate the hydrological fluxes at the grid scale watflood can simulate wetland dynamics and reservoir regulation for this study watflood was used to simulate a subset of the area from the churchill river nelson river and winnipeg river basins we limited the model domain to these watersheds because of limited resources available to re calibrate the entire ncrb for this study in this paper watflood refers to three independent model setups churchill river nelson river and winnipeg river basins that are used operationally however because the meteorological forcing dataset differed from what is used operationally the parameterization and results reported in this paper were for research purposes only 2 3 4 vic the variable infiltration capacity vic model is a free and open source hydrological model that solves water and energy balances and allows simulating all components of the hydrological cycle liang et al 1994 vic is a fully distributed continuous time scale model which handles sub grid heterogeneity e g elevation land cover type via statistical distributions and requires hydrological information at a flat and uniform grid scale 1 km the vic model uses empirical and physical approaches to solve the different hydrological cycle components liang et al 1994 the vic model discretizes a grid cell into different computational units and there is no interaction between grid cells the model runs on a daily time step to calculate the hydrological fluxes at the grid scale the vic model can simulate the dominant prairie pothole dynamics but it did not simulate any prairie watershed in this study wetland dynamics and reservoir regulation for this study vic simulated 10 major sub basins across the lower nelson river basin lnrb we limited the modelling domain to these sub watersheds due to model computational cost and prior knowledge of the basin lilhare et al 2020 2 3 5 hec hms hec hms is a free hydrological model developed by the us army corps of engineers that can simulate canopy interception surface storage infiltration baseflow and recharge evaporation transpiration snow accumulation and melt and overland lake and channel routing including some regulation structures us army corps of engineers 2016 hec hms was set up as a lumped model with a single basin for each watershed hec hms requires meteorological information at the basin scale but physiographic information is not directly ingested by the model instead physiographic data are used to inform realistic parameter ranges for calibration the hec hms model was run as a locally calibrated model and was set up to use a conceptual approach to solving the different hydrological cycle components hec hms was set up to discretize watersheds into three soil layers was set up to run as a continuous model and was run on a daily time step for this study hec hms was used to simulate a subset of the area from the red river basin four watersheds we set the model domain to the red river basin due to limited computational resources and because the area is of interest to the modelling team 2 3 6 swat giw the soil water assessment tool swat hydrological model is a free and open source hydrological model that simulates evapotranspiration surface runoff infiltration and the groundwater flow component of the hydrological cycle swat is a semi distributed continuous time scale model that operates on a daily time step and uses semi physically based approaches to solve the different hydrological cycle component arnold et al 2012 swat discretizes the basin into sub basins and further into different hrus based on a user s defined threshold for this study a modified version of the model swat giw following a procedure similar to that of muhammad et al 2020 was utilized to simulate the upper assiniboine river basin uarb at the kamsack watershed the swat giw model has the capacity to simulate the dominant prairie pothole wetlands fill spill processes and is able to capture the contributing and non contributing area dynamics dibike et al 2021 the modification to the standard version of the swat model resulted in 49 subbasins and 4506 hrus which is why the modelling domain was limited to the uarb only due to model computational cost and prior knowledge of the basin 2 3 7 raven hypr and raven uwfs raven craig et al 2020 is an open source hydrological modelling framework that supports multiple algorithms for representing different hydrological processes such as infiltration evapotranspiration and surface runoff raven can be run in lumped or semi distributed mode and requires hydrological information at the sub basin scale in this study raven discretized watersheds into different hrus and it discretized the soil into three layers two approaches are used for simulating prairie runoff dynamics hypr and uwfs hypr ahmed et al 2020a is an algorithm implemented in raven to simulate the fill and spill dynamics in pothole dominated landscapes of the prairies uwfs taheri et al 2023 is another probabilistic algorithm implemented in raven to simulate the fill and spill processes and is informed by distributional characteristics of pothole complexes such as their local contributing areas and storage deficits raven hypr and raven uwfs run on daily time resolution to calculate the discharge at the watershed scale for this study raven hypr and raven uwfs were used to simulate only the lewis creek watershed located in qu appelle river basin saskatchewan this was the only basin that was shared between this study and the work of taheri et al 2023 2 4 datasets for model development a standardized set of meteorological and physiographic information was used to ensure consistency in building the models and in comparing their performance the input datasets utilized include meteorological forcing elevation dem land cover and soil properties the datasets were chosen as they were agreed upon by many modellers during past projects i e grip gl mai et al 2022 the only new dataset relative to grip gl datasets is the dem selected here and described below 2 4 1 meteorological forcing rdrs v2 the regional deterministic reanalysis system version 2 rdrs v2 gasset et al 2021 was used to force the participating models in this study rdrs v2 was proposed because of its consistent approach in providing the required forcing variables and is based on the reanalysis of the canadian operational numerical weather prediction nwp system called the global environmental multiscale atmospheric model gem mailhot et al 2006 the reanalysis uses the optimal interpolation approach developed for the real time operational canadian precipitation analysis product capa lespinas et al 2015 which has been shown to be reliable over north america fortin et al 2018 however the precipitation estimates of rdrs v2 differ from capa estimates because the former is a reanalysis product and does incorporate more weather station information than what is normally available in real time we chose rdrs v2 because of its reliability and consistency over north america compared to other products gasset et al 2021 the rdrs v2 dataset includes precipitation amount downward solar flux incoming infrared flux specific and relative humidity atmospheric pressure air temperature and wind speed the variables are representative of the near surface level height except relative humidity 40 m above the surface air temperature 1 5 m and wind speed 10 m these are the common components used by many hydrological models rdrs v2 data are available over north america at an approximately 10 km grid resolution and an hourly time scale from 01 to 01 2000 to 31 12 2017 gasset et al 2021 these data were obtained from the canadian surface prediction archive website caspar mai et al 2020a for the ncrb 2 4 2 digital elevation model merit hydro merit hydro yamazaki et al 2019 is a global flow direction map at a 3 arc second resolution 90 m at the equator derived from the latest elevation data and water body datasets it contains flow direction flow accumulation hydrologically adjusted elevations and river channel width we used the hydrologically adjusted dem to delineate the ncrb and its selected watersheds for this study https hydro iis u tokyo ac jp yamadai merit dem we used the merit hydro product because it represents the hydrological features river and stream networks more accurately compared to other available product e g hydrosheds especially for higher latitudes yamazaki et al 2019 different modelling teams used their own approach of delineating the watersheds from the filled merit hydro dem with no sinks that typically denote non contributing areas nca no standardized delineation product was shared with the modelling teams to be used for model setup the nca sinks were ignored by almost all models during the delineation process except hype swat giw raven hypr and raven uwfs hype aggregated all sinks within the watershed as one conceptual lumped lake limited representation of nca while swat giw used the geospatial information of the sinks to parameterize its nca algorithm the two versions of the raven model used conceptual parameters identified through model calibration to parameterize their nca algorithms it is important to note that the watflood model is the only model that used another dem srtm to delineate the watersheds this was because the modelling team used pre existing model setups for the study which was a result of limited resources available to re build the model setups 2 4 3 land cover data nalcms the north american land change monitoring system nalcms latifovic et al 2016 at 30 m resolution was used to obtain the land cover types across the ncrb nalcms provides a harmonized view of the physical cover of earth s surface across the north american continent based on 2010 landsat satellite imagery we used the nalcms product because it is a result of a collaborative initiative between canada us and mexico and have accurate representation of the different land cover classes over north america with high resolution nalcms comprises 19 land cover classes and is publicly available from https www cec org tools and resources map files land cover 2010 landsat 30m 2 4 4 soil data gsde global soil dataset for earth system modelling gsde shangguan et al 2014 is based on the soil map of the world and various regional and national soil databases including soil attribute data and soil maps we used gsde because it provides comprehensive soil information globally by combining data from different sources into a harmonized product it provides soil information including soil particle size distribution organic carbon and nutrients etc there are 11 types of soil general information and 34 soil properties for eight depths the dataset is provided at 30arc seconds resolution 1 km and can be downloaded from https globalchange bnu edu cn research soilw download the watflood model is the only model that used another soil data product surficial geology of canada dataset geological survey of canada 2014 this dataset was used because it allowed for easier parameterization of the watflood model and consistency with past practises 2 5 model calibration and evaluation for streamflow the simulation period selected for this study was from 2000 to 2017 which was consistent with the availability of rdrs v2 forcing this period also encompassed significant wet and dry cycles across the ncrb and is of interest to the practitioners participating in this study we used a hydrological year for the model simulation october to september the period from jan 2000 to sep 2000 was used for model spin up which is a relatively dry period bonsal et al 2013 and can facilitate model spin up and initialization ahmed et al 2021 2020a the period from oct 2000 to sep 2011 was used for calibration which included the 2011 flooding event and the early 2000 s droughts extending across the ncrb domain including such variability high and low flow events in the calibration period is known to improve the process of model parameters identification singh and bárdossy 2012 especially in that region ahmed et al 2021 2020a the period from oct 2011 to sep 2017 was used for validation and was a relatively wet period median kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 for streamflow simulation computed at a daily time scale and at the specific watersheds used in each model was used for model calibration each model was calibrated independently by its respective modelling group to fit observed streamflow only during the calibration period we chose the median over the mean kge to reduce the effects of outlier stations i e watersheds stations with exceptionally poor performance on the calibration process the simulated hydrographs uncalibrated models of phase 0 and calibrated models of phase 1 were investigated separately for each watershed and model using the kge performance metric kge was selected for streamflow evaluation since it gives a more comprehensive assessment of bias and timing error between the simulated hydrograph and observed record knoben et al 2019 showed that simulations with a kge score 0 3 are considered acceptable behavioral which is roughly equivalent to the commonly used behavioral nse score 0 5 for daily streamflow values we divided the acceptable behavioral range of kge score suggested by knoben et al 2019 0 3 1 0 into three equal sections to represent acceptable good and excellent flow simulation table 2 any simulation with kge score 0 3 is considered unacceptable the streamflow performance of each model at the simulated watersheds was depicted as a spatial map which shows the actual location of the watershed outlet flow gauge and or box and whisker plots a detailed description of the box and whisker plots is provided in the supplemental file section s6 2 6 evaluation of model fidelity through model verifications 2 6 1 overview of data and aggregation approach the goal of these analyses was to explore reasons why model performance varies in reproducing the hydrology of the ncrb region verification of hydrological processes state and flux estimates within the models specifically actual evapotranspiration aet and snow water equivalent swe was used to assess the fidelity of the participating models these model outputs were used for verification only with no calibration as the models were calibrated to fit streamflow only given the limited observational datasets available for model fidelity assessment reanalysis products for aet and swe comparison were used here for model verification the reasons for this are two fold first actual point observations especially aet are extremely limited and are not well distributed across the ncrb figure s2 and figure s4 this would limit the comparison to specific areas regions and may introduce problems when aggregating observations to the watershed scale especially for large watersheds with limited point data that could fail to represent the watershed average conditions second these data do not typically cover the full simulation period and or they are intermittent particularly swe observations the reanalysis products used in this study showed good performance compared to the available observations supplemental file section s3 since there are issues when comparing essentially one reanalysis with another hydrological model we note that given that the reanalysis is usually based on some basic data assimilation procedures for the land surface simulations with optimally interpolated values the comparison is reasonable also it is important to note that we used independent reanalysis information from the fifth generation european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf re analysis era5 and global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam as noted below the verification datasets reanalysis products are available at different spatiotemporal scales it was necessary to unify the scale across these datasets and match each candidate model s outputs to evaluate its performance both the verification datasets and model outputs are aggregated to a temporal daily time scale and the spatial discretization scale of the given model watershed for lumped models sub watershed for semi distributed vector based models grid for semi distributed grid based model then performance metrics were calculated at that spatiotemporal scale this was necessary given that the pre defined geospatial resolution for each model varies substantially the delineated watersheds boundary might be different for different models and we chose the native resolution for land based fluxes and states because the purpose here is not to compare models against each other rather understand why they succeed fail this was done also to avoid disadvantaging lumped models since they cannot produce spatially variable states fluxes performance by ecozone facilitated identifying any of the model structural deficiencies since each ecozone is dominated by specific hydrological processes controls e g pothole dynamics in the prairies vegetation dynamics in boreal plains etc pearson correlation coefficient r was used as the performance metric to compare the performance of the model simulations to the benchmark verification data at the aforementioned spatiotemporal scale of aggregation the evaluation period is different for different variables and are listed below for both aet and swe we used r to measure the correlation and check if the models are capturing the correct pattern since there might be differences in the actual values of the reanalysis products because they are not actual field measurements kge was not favored since its use implies that the used benchmark data are actual observations which is not the case as mentioned earlier the reanalysis products were used as surrogates of the actual conditions and therefore r was used for that purpose however kge analysis is presented in the supplemental file section s5 1 and section s5 2 for aet and swe respectively to give an additional indication of the overall performance and goodness of fit of the simulated timeseries a behavioral threshold of 0 7 for r is used here to distinguish poor simulation any model with median r across its discretized computational units spatial resolution watershed sub watershed or grid 0 7 is considered acceptable and is capturing the process evaluated aet or swe reasonably the behavioral range of r 0 7 1 identified from mai et al 2022 was divided into three equal sections similar to kge to represent acceptable good and excellent flow simulation table 2 spatial maps and or box and whiskers plots were used to show the different models performance with regard to aet and swe supplemental file section s5 2 6 2 actual evapotranspiration gleam the gleam martens et al 2017 https www gleam eu reanalysis product v3 5b was used as benchmark data for aet gleam is a global dataset that contains estimates of the different components of evaporative fluxes gleam uses the priestley taylor equation based on air temperature and net radiation to calculate evaporative fluxes gleam is driven by remote sensing observations to constrain the calculated potential evaporation rates martens et al 2017 the data are available at a daily time resolution from 2003 to 2017 on a 0 25 degree grid globally actual evapotranspiration rates from gleam e variable from v3 5b dataset mm day were cropped to the ncrb domain and were used to assess the models realism in simulating evapotranspiration amounts the gleam aet product was used for this study because it showed good performance when compared against actual point observations supplemental file section s3 1 and was proven to be more accurate than other reanalysis products e g modis and era interim jia et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 the aet evaluation period is set from jan 2003 to sep 2017 which is the period with both gleam data and model outputs overlapping 2 6 3 snow water equivalent era5 land era5 land balsamo et al 2015 is a reanalysis product that provides multiple land variables by reanalyzing and combining land components of the era5 atmospheric model with ground observations the data include meteorological variables as well as other hydrological fluxes storages for the entire globe we used the snow depth water equivalent sd variable in the dataset meters for swe evaluation the data are available at an hourly time resolution from 1950 to present at a 0 1 degree grid globally the data were cropped to the ncrb boundary for the simulation period and aggregated to daily average values to be used for model evaluation the era5 land swe product was used for this study because it showed good performance when compared against actual point observations and against other remote sensing reanalysis products e g globsnow v3 supplemental file section s3 2 also era5 land was found to be accurate over other parts in canada great lakes mai et al 2022 era5 land data were downloaded from https doi org 10 24381 cds e2161bac the swe evaluation period was set from oct 2000 to sep 2017 which is the period with both era5 land data and model outputs overlapping 3 results 3 1 streamflow performance phase 0 fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of kge for all simulated watersheds for each model using an uncalibrated model setup phase 0 for the simulation period not surprisingly most of the models showed poor performance for the simulated watersheds chosen by the different modelling groups the three different models set up through the raven modelling framework blended lumped raven hypr and raven uwfs showed the lowest kge median score across the candidate models with wide distribution of kge values hype and vic showed kge scores closer to zero but hype exhibited a wide range of kge across the simulated watersheds compared to vic the swat giw model showed relatively better performance with median kge of 0 22 and narrow kge distribution watflood and hec hms showed the best performance across the different models with median kge of 0 48 and 0 57 respectively poor performance across all models was expected especially with conceptual models since these models were not calibrated and performance was tied to how the modellers set the uncalibrated initial values of the parameters for example the blended lumped parameters for this phase were set using the average value of the feasible parameter space table s2 other models e g hype vic raven hypr and raven uwfs used random values for parameters from the feasible parameters space or based on previous model setups in other domains however hec hms watflood and swat giw parameters were set based on prior knowledge and experience within this study domain these models were implemented by provincial agencies or consulting firms working in this region with a good understanding of the area and several years of continuous model development their knowledge and experience of the area and use of previously existing parameter values from models developed in this region using different setups contributed to a reasonable simulation of flow even in the phase 0 experiment finally those models with flow estimates using one sample i e one watershed cannot be expected to do well given the sample size 3 2 streamflow performance phase 1 the calibration process improved the performance of all models for both the calibration fig 4 and validation periods fig 5 compared to the uncalibrated model performance fig 3 and figure s9 for the calibration period fig 4 the blended lumped watflood and hec hms models exhibited the strongest performance across candidate models with median kge of 0 79 0 81 and 0 81 respectively most simulated watersheds 65 had good to excellent kge scores 0 53 1 seen from the spatial plot and the narrower boxplot range within each panel fig 4 the blended lumped model had relatively poor performance over a few watersheds within the prairie ecozone models that have some form of non contributing area physics e g swat giw raven hypr and raven uwfs showed relatively good performance median kge 0 50 over a small number of prairie ecozone watersheds 2 watersheds out of 132 selected watersheds the vic model also had reasonable performance over its simulated watersheds in the northern manitoba boreal shield ecozone median kge of 0 43 and performed poorly for a couple of watersheds near the most downstream portion of the lower nelson subbasin in the hudson bay lowlands hudson plain ecozone hype showed reasonable simulation of the flows across all 132 watersheds with a median kge of 0 46 but the model had a wide range of kge fig 4 hype showed unacceptable flow simulation performance across the prairies central part of the saskatchewan river and entire assiniboine river kge 0 3 while it showed reasonable to good performance elsewhere the performance of blended lumped and the prairie models swat giw raven hypr raven uwfs decreased significantly median kge reduced by almost 0 3 for the validation period fig 5 relative to the calibration period fig 4 in general the performance of the rest of the models also decreased median kge but not as significantly a large discrepancy between calibration and validation performance can be a sign of parameters that are overfit to the calibration period hype almost maintained the same performance compared to the calibration period overall watflood and hec hms models showed the best performance during the validation period with median kges of 0 69 and 0 66 respectively however this must be considered carefully given the limited number of watersheds mostly non prairie in these setups relative to other models that ran a larger subset of watersheds over multiple ecozones blended lumped and hype showed acceptable simulation during validation with median kges of 0 53 and 0 43 respectively given that they simulated a large number of watersheds including the difficult regions fig 5 vic and swat giw showed borderline acceptable simulation with kges of 0 32 and 0 34 respectively while the rest of the models had unacceptable flow simulation during the validation period median kge 0 3 it is generally difficult to predict streamflow of watersheds in the prairie ecozone table s10 accurately across all different models fig 6 shows the distribution of kge for the different ecozones during the calibration and validation period for the candidate models the decrease in kge scores for the validation period compared to the calibration is noticeable for almost all models model performance for both the calibration and validation periods was acceptable across the different ecozones for almost all models median kge 0 3 except for the prairies and hudson plain watersheds table s10 at which models showed either unacceptable or lower performance compared to other ecozones especially during the validation period the exception is the hec hms model that showed good performance for the two prairie watersheds it simulated the contributing area for these basins is large and they are located in downstream portions of the prairie ecozone therefore they are not significantly dominated impacted by the prairie fill and spill dynamics which makes it relatively easier to model fig 4 and fig 5 hype showed a wider range of kge with unacceptable median performance for both the calibration and validation periods over prairie watersheds hype also showed lower kge performance over the hudson plain when compared to other ecozones simulated by the same model this can also be concluded for the blended lumped where lower kge scores over the hudson plain compared to other ecozones are apparent especially during the validation period the vic model had difficulties in replicating flows over the same area hudson plains are dominated by discontinuous to continuous permafrost flat landscapes with poorly to undefined drainage networks and numerous wetlands depressions and lakes ecological framework of canada 1999 which make it similarly dominated by the fill and spill mechanism like the prairie region these dominant and dynamic hydrological controls are typically not at all or only poorly represented in hydrological models which makes it challenging to get accurate simulation of the flow at that area to perform a cross comparison among models while accounting for the limited number of coincident watershed locations models were compared at overlapping watersheds fig 7 shows the median kge comparison for each model at coincident watersheds simulated by other models for both the calibration and validation periods for illustration for the calibration period median kge of the hype model at overlapping watersheds with the blended lumped model common 119 watersheds stations between the two models is 0 47 while the median kge for blended lumped at common watersheds with hype same 119 stations mentioned earlier is 0 79 fig 7 a cross comparison of the models performance at common watersheds showed that they had relatively acceptable performance during the calibration period fig 7 blended lumped showed the best performance during the calibration period compared to other models and it simulated most of the watersheds 119 out of 132 in the study area fig 7 watflood and hec hms models showed the best performance over the limited number of eight and four watersheds simulated respectively when compared to the same watersheds simulated by other models hype blended lumped and vic hype showed overall acceptable performance across the largest subset of watersheds when compared to other models however it showed poor performance across the prairie watershed e g lewis creek in the saskatchewan river basin that was simulated by both raven hypr and raven uwfs fig 7 this is expected since hype does not include a non contributing area prairie module to simulate the dynamic fill and spill mechanism the same conclusions are realized in the validation period fig 7 the performance of blended lumped decreased in validation same as concluded by fig 6 but still showed acceptable simulation performance in 78 of watersheds except for the three prairie watersheds that were successfully simulated by hec hms raven hypr and raven uwfs hype s performance remained acceptable for 61 of the simulated watersheds and it struggled at the same three prairie watersheds that were successfully simulated by hec hms raven hypr and raven uwfs although hype showed significant errors when simulating the same one watershed as raven hypr and raven uwfs in the calibration period the model was able to simulate its flow reasonably acceptably in the validation period this likely occurred because the validation period is wetter on average in those watersheds and the potholes remain full and the landscape drainage network connected i e no dramatic changes in contributing area in this period and the lake module of hype was able to produce reasonable streamflow in wet periods during drier years where the landscape disconnects from the main drainage network hype has not been able to adequately simulate runoff therefore the lake module of hype is insufficient for simulating prairie region runoff dynamics across a range of hydrological conditions it failed in most prairie watershed fig 5 3 3 model fidelity of phase 1 3 3 1 aet simulation the distribution of the pearson correlation coefficient r between the benchmark and simulated aet at the simulation scale watershed for lumped models and sub watershed for semi distributed models for the candidate models is plotted in fig 8 for each ecozone overall models showed acceptable performance in simulating evaporative fluxes at the simulation scale over the different ecozones as indicated by the distribution and median correlation coefficient value r 0 7 fig 8 hype showed good aet simulation with median correlation of 0 8 and narrow distribution across the different ecozones including the prairies the raven hypr model showed poor performance in simulating aet over the one prairie watershed modelled however the other raven model configuration raven uwfs showed excellent aet simulation of r 0 90 over the same watershed although the blended lumped model performed well in the overall simulation of lumped aet it struggled over the prairie region also noticeable in the spatial distribution of correlation for the watersheds modelled figure s11 with unacceptable median correlation value and wider range of the distribution of the correlation values watflood showed unacceptable aet for all simulated grids within the boreal shield ecozone fig 8 and figure s11 raven hypr overestimated aet in the lewis creek prairie watersheds modelled the blended lumped model showed poor correlation coefficient and had significant errors in estimating aet amounts over and or under estimation timing and or a combination of both in 42 out of 61 simulated prairie watersheds this suggests that the models generated erroneous aet values to achieve a reasonable simulation of streamflow the same conclusions can be drawn from kge analysis figure s12 this was expected since correlation constitutes a significant portion of the kge metric however the only exception is the watflood model which showed good aet simulation as indicated by median kge over the boreal shield ecozone the correlation between the simulated aet by watflood and the benchmark aet data was relatively poor fig 8 and therefore more efforts might be needed to investigate how the model simulated aet see table s9 for detailed description of models structure and process representation 3 3 2 swe simulation fig 9 shows the distribution of the pearson correlation coefficient r between the benchmarked era5 land and the simulated swe for the different discretization scale for each model of phase 1 experiment for the full simulation period swat giw was not included in this analysis due to difficulty in retrieving its swe simulations from model outputs overall most models showed excellent daily swe simulation from oct 2000 to sep 2017 with median r 0 9 across the different ecozones hype showed excellent overall simulation of swe with median of 0 95 and relatively narrow distribution of r even though it was compared at a finer scale sub watershed level compared to the rest of the models watershed scale except watflood blended lumped and hec hms also showed excellent performance with median r of 0 94 for both models with the former model being applied to much larger subset of watersheds compared to the latter however the two models set up within the raven modelling framework raven hypr and raven uwfs showed unacceptable swe simulation over the simulated watershed in the prairies with median r of 0 28 and 0 27 respectively spatial plot figure s13 in summary the models showed relatively good simulation of swe amounts when looking at r and kge values fig 9 and figure s14 respectively suggesting that the snow dynamics in the models are working reasonably well 4 discussion 4 1 on the relationship between streamflow process representation and modelled area the uncalibrated models phase 0 fig 3 resulted in unacceptable streamflow performance which is anticipated when using random parameter sets to represent a hydrologically unique and complex environment however proper parameter values inferred from prior knowledge any past modelling experiments or setups in the region of interest or based on knowledge of the actual hydrological conditions in the basin can improve uncalibrated model performance and lead to reasonable simulation results e g watflood and hec hms models phase 0 fig 3 however the calibration process improved the performance of all participating models when compared to the uncalibrated version figure s9 with all models showing acceptable to good performance during the calibration period the performance of the blended lumped model improved significantly after calibration because the parameters of the uncalibrated model were set using the average value of the feasible parameter space table s2 which contributed to its poor performance for phase 0 as the parameters did not reflect the actual conditions of the simulated watersheds again as anticipated model performance declined during the validation period except for hype over the different areas of the ncrb among the models that simulated all or a large subset of the selected watersheds blended lumped showed good overall flow simulation while the hype model showed acceptable overall performance in simulating the entire domain other models e g watflood and hec hms showed good streamflow simulation but at limited watersheds blended lumped is a lumped and locally calibrated model i e a unique parameter set is obtained for each watershed which gave it additional degrees of freedom during calibration and resulted in an improved simulation of streamflow over almost all simulated watersheds locally calibrated models typically outperform regional and global models mai et al 2022 similar behavior was found here in the good performance of blended lumped relative to other models the performance of the locally calibrated models might diminish in the validation but such models are easier to set up and calibrate compared to regional and global models mai et al 2022 hype is a global model which means it applied one global parameter set to simulate the entire region which here was 132 watersheds this had limited hype s ability to better replicate the streamflow at each individual watershed but resulted in a more stable calibration validation approach i e little to no deterioration in streamflow performance for the different periods fig 6 models showed unacceptable performance or struggled over watersheds dominated by numerous potholes lakes e g the prairies and hudson plain fig 6 that result in disconnected and dynamic drainage networks despite the models having reasonable performance in the prairie region over the calibration period their performance deteriorated in validation or reduced more significantly than other ecozones suggesting the model calibrations were not as robust and that the models structurally are unable to represent the complex dynamics of dis connecting between the potholes and their influence on streamflow generation two prairie specific models e g raven hypr and raven uwfs showed poor performance in the validation period across one prairie watershed while the third prairie model swat giw showed borderline acceptable simulation in the validation period fig 5 which may suggest that the representation of the potholes and non contributing area dynamics within these models remain insufficient or the vertical water budgets estimates are poorly simulated currently available non contributing area modules may not replicate the hysteretic and non linear response of prairie watersheds which leads to unsuccessful flow simulation ahmed et al 2021 this needs further investigation for these models analysis of the aet flux showed that the blended lumped model had severe discrepancies in estimating the lumped aet mainly overestimation fig 8 likely to compensate for the missing pothole representation water storage dynamics and to achieve adequate streamflow performance since there is no contributing area dynamics module inside the model the calibration facilitated the removal of portions of runoff that should have been stored in the depressions in the form of evaporative fluxes to get reasonable flow simulation watflood model also produced good streamflow simulation but relatively poor aet simulation over the boreal shield ecozone when looking at correlation coefficient fig 8 however it showed good kge simulation overall aet simulation figure s12 parameter equifinality in calibration might contribute to the poor aet correlation performance from watflood and more investigation might be needed to revisit how watflood simulated aet these are examples of a model that is giving the right answer for the wrong reason where the calibration process achieved strong streamflow simulation at the cost of aet simulation kirchner 2006 hype had unacceptable streamflow simulation over the prairies fig 6 but very good simulation of the evaporative fluxes fig 8 hype could not replicate prairie runoff generation and streamflow even when calibrated because it does not have a non contributing area pothole module the calibration process did not affect aet process simulation of hype this has happened likely because hype used a global parameter set which might have reduced the effects of parameter overfitting to achieve a reasonable calibration target streamflow another possible reason is that hype used the modified hargreaves samani method which is an empirical method that also showed relatively reasonable aet simulation for other models in this study hec hms and watflood table s9 most of the models showed relatively good simulation of swe amounts over the various ecozones suggesting that the snow dynamics in the models are working reasonably well fig 9 and figure s14 however the raven hypr and raven uwfs models showed unacceptable swe simulation over the one simulated watershed in the prairies spatial plot figure s13 the models used the simplified temperature index approach for snow dynamics simulation this approach relies heavily on calibration since it is difficult to link its parameters to actual physical meanings or measurements and therefore it can easily produce unrealistic simulation of swe amounts to arrive at a successful flow simulation right answer for the wrong reason there is some evidence to suggest the models are also missing proper representations of wetland fens and bogs dynamics across the boreal plain and boreal shield regions table s9 but they are still able to achieve acceptable streamflow fig 6 and aet fig 8 performance hype has a simple wetland dynamics module which may have led to improving aet flux estimates it is known that wetland dynamics significantly influence streamflow amount and timing price et al 2005 however hydrological models with no proper representation of wetland dynamics have been shown to accurately simulate streamflow reasonably in this region previously davison et al 2016 further analysis for example using soil moisture observations or total water storage in watersheds is needed to investigate the importance of these features in simulating the hydrological cycle over that region 4 2 benchmarking streamflow model performance across ncrb establishing a reference kge threshold to distinguish behavioral from non behavioral simulations has been quite a subjective topic over the past decade different studies have suggested different kge benchmark values kling et al 2012 knoben et al 2019 mai et al 2022 largely without any consideration of the complexities of the area being modelled moreover review of the prairie hydrological modelling literature reveals that many models have historically struggled to achieve equal or even satisfactory performance across the prairies stadnyk et al 2020 there is therefore an interest in establishing a baseline benchmark for expected model performance in this region for practitioners and the academic hydrological community we selected a constant acceptable performance threshold value kge 0 3 suggested in the literature by knoben et al 2019 re examining this threshold by considering distinct ecozones however suggests a much lower benchmark kge value is achievable for the prairie ecozone relative to other regions an ensemble of kge values achieved by the different models in nelson mip over the simulation period of the phase 1 experiment is provided in fig 10 we used the mean value over median to reflect the difficulty in simulating each zone by including outliers watersheds with poor performance which are common across ncrb especially in the prairies the range of kge scores for each ecozone is relatively narrow except for the prairies and hudson plain ecozones fig 10 application of the two sided wilcoxon rank sum test to each pair of ecozones based on the ensemble kge values for each ecozone showed statistically significant differences between the prairies versus the boreal plain ecozone p value 6 26 10 5 the prairies versus the boreal shield ecozone p value 1 24 10 4 and the prairies versus the western cordillera ecozone p value 5 00 10 3 fig 11 therefore the prairies showed a significantly lower kge value than these other three regions fig 10 no other pair of ecozones showed significant differences with this test p values 5 00 10 2 fig 11 which is unsurprising given the extremely small sample size for the other ecozones involved in these tests taiga shield and hudson plain all have 10 or fewer data points fig 10 the mean value of the ensemble kge from all models remains above the 0 3 threshold however the prairies on average were not able to achieve the same mean score having a lower mean 0 17 compared to other ecozones fig 10 these results demonstrate a lower benchmark kge for prairie watersheds should be expected in future studies and suggest an acceptable model performance threshold of kge 0 17 should be used across the prairies it is important to note that advances in incorporating proper prairie pothole and non contributing area dynamics into models could improve this benchmark in future studies this shows that reference kge values can vary by ecozone presumably due to hydrological complexity and features that may cause models to struggle in simulating that region and should not be set to a fixed number 4 3 nelson mip project benefits challenges and insights model intercomparison studies have been criticized for the lack of reproducibility and transparency clark et al 2011 hutton et al 2016 peel and mcmahon 2020 mainly for two reasons the first is that most of the studies compare the performance of the aggregated model output streamflow which limits the scientific community s knowledge of how the different process representation affects the results the second is that model failures are not typically reported in such studies however in this study we evaluated the performance of the models with respect to streamflow simulation and other internal hydrological variables aet and swe and we were transparent about model failures in the different aspects like the previous impc model intercomparison studies grip e mai et al 2021 and grip gl mai et al 2022 we also made all the used dataset e g observed benchmark data and model results publicly available ahmed et al 2023 https uc hal github io projects html nelson mip all of this helps in better informing the scientific community about the structural differences of the participating models and would give scientists and practitioners the ability to further explore the outputs results of this study model intercomparison projects mips are useful for researchers and practitioners since they provide scientific and practical knowledge in this study we were able to identify that the models need proper representation of non contributing area dynamics to replicate prairie runoff generation and streamflow without this enhanced structural representation models produce unacceptable long term performance of either streamflow or hydrological processes even if the model is well calibrated the nelson mip study is useful to practitioners and policy makers as it tests a wide range of different hydrological models and model configurations commonly used within the ncrb we could not make a solid basin wide assessment about the different participating models with regards to streamflow and internal hydrological variable simulations since the different models were tested on different subsets of the selected watershed limited areas with only two models running large subset of the watersheds continental scale application of hydrological models even in hydrologically complex regions presents an advantage for water resources practitioners and management such that results can support water supply allocation and assessment of regional water loss improvements in non contributing area runoff generation dynamics are needed for models being applied to the prairie region for them to provide accurate predictions of long term water loss and streamflow generation intercomparison projects require significant amounts of effort to be completed with little reward a lesson learned from this study is that it is difficult to find hydrologists who can dedicate the time and resources over several years to participate in such projects especially over large scale domains available resources funding computing power time etc are limited and therefore they have been preventing hydrologists from participating in this study available resources modellers interest and prior knowledge of certain areas play a significant role in selecting which watersheds to simulate in such studies when hydrologists participate in mips they prefer to include scope areas or research questions of interest to them therefore it may be challenging to do more of these studies in the future unless appropriate resources are made available to facilitate building the models codes workflows to facilitate building and running the models knoben et al 2022 some of the challenges of the study are as follows 1 most models ran a subset of the selected watersheds which prevented us from making a basin wide assessment of the different models 2 the vastness and diverse nature of the ncrb creates practical challenges for modellers 3 research should continue to strive to bring modelling groups together to collaborate share experiences and ultimately improve understanding of the complex hydrology within the ncrb a call for project participants was released and limited resource support through students and computational support was made available regular monthly meetings with project participants were scheduled to discuss the experimental setup of the study track the progress of modelling effort and to provide technical and computing support if needed fig 1 even with the offered support only parties and modellers with a vested interest in the ncrb region and water supply were able to be involved except the raven modelling team who received funding through gwf for this project this region is also well known as a difficult region to model which have deterred some modelling groups presumably out of fear of how their models would be represented within the study the goal of this study however was not to rank models or compare outcomes but to learn from what the models collective did well and what they were not capable of doing as well we tried to avoid the question of how good a model is and instead focus on what a particular model may be good or not for this points to one of the prevailing challenges of mips in general the perception that model rank somehow infers or is directly transferable to model uptake in other studies across other domains clark et al 2011 this should not be and is not the main message or rationale for conducting this intercomparison study the real value in the nelson mip project is the idea of generating an ensemble of models to simulate the hydrology of the ncrb such that uncertainty bounds benchmarking standards and future ensembles of projected water supply can be elucidated the limited overlapping domain of the phase 1 experiment limits this ideal application however still affords some measure of model performance benchmarking and uncertainty and provides the framework datasets and methods of comparison that will facilitate the inclusion of more models in the future to help in generating more reliable ensemble of models simulation 5 conclusion the performance of eight hydrological models was compared over different headwater and unregulated watersheds in the nelson churchill river basin in north america most of the models ran on a small subset 10 of the selected watersheds 132 watersheds in total based on available resources of the participating modelling team except for hype which modelled all 132 watersheds and blended lumped which modelled 119 of the 132 watersheds a brief overview of the outcomes and answers to the addressed research questions of this study is shown in table 3 further some of the main findings of this paper are as follows 1 most models had difficulties in replicating prairie streamflow due to either missing or simplified representation of the non contributing area dynamics one model hec hms had good results over two prairie watersheds simulated but this might have happened because the watersheds are not significantly dominated by non contributing areas 2 the analysis showed that some models provided reasonable streamflow simulation in the prairies at the cost of aet simulation right answer for the wrong reason mostly due to the missing or poor representation of the non contributing area dynamics 3 swe analysis showed that the snow dynamics are very well represented in most participating models 4 current model s kge streamflow performance is expected to be approximately 0 17 over the prairies indicating the importance of a continued research focus on improving the behavioral performance in regions affected by dynamic non contributing areas 5 several models performed good to excellent in streamflow simulation within the boreal plain boreal shield taiga shield and western cordillera ecozones this study has both scientific and practical outcomes as it can guide future model development in the complex region and provides insights on the models performance in that area practitioners can use this study to highlight useful models for their modelling purposes streamflow and or hydrological flux simulations which can improve management of available water resources and provide more water and food security for future generations efforts are currently being made to move to phase 2 of the project at which the same participating models performance is tested on regulated watersheds this will help in further validating the ability of the models to produce regulated streamflow and can highlight further areas where model structural improvements are needed more efforts are also needed to assess the models accuracy in estimating other flow signatures e g peak flow and low flows mehr and kahya 2017 credit

1753,natural sediments or aquifers frequently exhibit layering and structural contrasts which give rise to anomalous mass transfer behavior moreover the effects of the interface on mass transfer and mixing in layered porous media lpm may be different when the flow direction is reversed resulting in asymmetrical dispersive transport and a significant disparity between predictions and actual observations despite its importance the underlying mechanism remains an open question to address this gap laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were conducted the results demonstrated that the effective dispersion coefficient is larger when the solute migrates from the coarse grain layer to the fine grain layer c f direction compared to the f c direction the history of the solute across the interface and the flow adjacent to the interface affect this deviation pore scale simulations revealed a more tortuous flow field with a higher proportion of low and high velocities in the fine grain layer although the velocity characteristics of the entire lpm were insensitive to flow direction measuring the velocity characteristics of lpm alone is insufficient to predict the asymmetrical dispersive transport behavior to quantitatively evaluate mass transfer between layers and residual contaminants in lpm a mass transfer index ε was introduced the results of ε along with the pore scale concentration directly indicated that the interface limited the mass transfer the effect was more pronounced in the c f direction and particularly evident in the heterogeneous lpm which ultimately enhanced the solute mixing in the heterogenous lpm the maximum dilution index for the c f direction is 1 31 times larger than that for the f c direction the findings contribute to a better

solute transport is commonly encountered in natural systems and widely employed in industrial production understanding the mechanisms of mass transfer and solute mixing process in porous media especially in highly heterogeneous porous media is of fundamental importance in many fields for example chemical engineering chen et al 2018 geochemical processes soltanian et al 2015 environmental microbiology de anna et al 2020 scheidweiler et al 2020 carbon capture and storage an et al 2021 song et al 2016 and oil recovery bijeljic et al 2011 huber et al 2014 pore size or morphological diversity due to the disordered pore structures results in the flow velocity with spatial and temporal variations in heterogeneous porous media which in turn determine the fate of contaminant migration in hyporheic zone sediments or aquifers brusseau 2020 dou et al 2022 prommer et al 2019 accurate description or prediction of the contaminant migration in hyporheic zone sediments hester et al 2017 lu et al 2022 or aquifers rolle and le borgne 2019 yang et al 2015 zhan et al 2009a has been a constant concern but a challenging work the lpm refers to the porous media that consists of contrasting pore space structures and hydraulic properties in different layers or regions liang et al 2019 as shown in fig 1 the lpm system is widely distributed in natural sediments or aquifers and can be regarded as a typical type of highly heterogeneous porous media at the macroscopic scale for example the low permeability zone scattered in aquifers yang et al 2015 the aquifer aquitard system li et al 2021 zhan et al 2009b and the fracture rock matrix system wang et al 2022 furthermore the wide application of lpm has garnered significant interest from researchers across diverse fields the effects of lpm on flow and solute transport have found extensive practical use in various engineering applications alemany et al 2022 asiaei et al 2019 siavashi et al 2018 due to the abrupt change in properties at the interface the fluid flow and mass transfer behavior tend to be anomalous and hard to predict krishna et al 2021 krishna et al 2020 for instance the flow near a pumping well is initially a non darcian flow region and then transits to be a darcian flow region wen et al 2008 at the bottom of the riverbed a transition layer exists which is characterized by a drastic decrease of velocity as a matching zone between the surface free fluid and sediments goharzadeh et al 2005 meanwhile the flow in such a transition layer is no longer laminar but an extension of turbulent flow in the surface free fluid the flow in this area strongly controls the release or trapping of mass resulting in the early break or heavy tail in the breakthrough curve kim and kang 2020 although the above studies were carried out in the free fluid porous media system they emphasized the influence of the interface on flow and mass transfer several studies have investigated fluid flow in lpm and have highlighted the substantial influence of interfaces on internal pressure dynamics li et al 2018 shokri et al 2010 zhang et al 2022 in hydrogeology studies the impact of interfaces on solute transport in accurately predicting contaminant migration has been relatively overlooked despite its potential significance to model anomalous transport across an interface marseguerra and zoia 2006 proposed a monte carlo approach their scheme could simulate a neat jump in resident concentration by varying the local velocity when particles cross the interface berkowitz et al 2009 experimentally investigated the interfacial solute transport across the lpm using sands packed column and observed a significant asymmetrical dispersive transport as shown in fig 1 they argued that the phenomenon breakthrough curve btc depends on the flow direction is related to solute accumulation at the interface meanwhile this anomalous transport could not be explained by macroscopic parameters cortis and zoia 2009 proposed a modified continuous time random walk formulation in which particles have different probabilities of moving forward or backward when solute is transported in different directions other recent experimental studies related to solute transport in lpm have focused on the solute loading and unloading processes erfani et al 2021 the influence of the transition layer chen et al 2022 and dispersion dejam and hassanzadeh 2022 more recently the microfluid model has been employed to investigate mass exchange across interfaces providing pore scale information that explains the slow release of contamination in layered porous media walczak et al 2022 however neither the analytical approach nor the experiment can measure fluid flow and mass transfer processes in the pore space and thus cannot directly prove that mass accumulates at the interface moreover to our best knowledge the study related to mixing behavior in lpm is still lacking mixing is the process that homogenizes initially segregated miscible constituents and affects the solute transport behavior in porous media heyman et al 2021 souzy et al 2020 valocchi et al 2018 including dispersion dilution and reaction for reactive species mixing facilitates chemical reactions and therefore plays a key role in contaminant migration in sediments or aquifers dentz et al 2018 considerable efforts have been made de dreuzy and carrera 2016 heyman et al 2021 rolle and kitanidis 2014 to investigate the influence of porous media structure and flow behavior on mixing the complex pore space structure at the pore scale and the spatial variability of hydraulic properties at the field scale both contribute to the mixing as pointed out above interface and flow direction have a significant effect on the solute transport in lpm flow direction therefore has the potential to influence mixing behavior and alter the final state of contaminant in geologic lpm including the contaminant distribution chemical composition and concentration it has been confirmed that the fate of solute is strongly dependent on the mixing history le borgne et al 2015 villermaux 2019 however the question of how the interface affects solute mixing in lpm with different flow directions is still open to address this gap both laboratory experiments and pore scale numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the mechanics of the asymmetrical dispersive transport and solute mixing process in lpm under different flow directions benefiting from the high resolution of measurement and well controlled experimental conditions pore scale modeling could provide fundamental insight for understanding macroscale phenomena jiménez martínez et al 2017 wang et al 2020 xing et al 2021 zheng et al 2022 zhou et al 2019 most of the above studies focused on single porous media and did not consider the influence of flow direction on solute transport in lpm the rest of this paper is organized as follows first the experimental setup and simulation strategy are described in section 2 the results derived from the laboratory scale and pore scale investigations are shown and discussed in section 3 in section 4 the summary and conclusion are presented 2 methodology and modeling 2 1 laboratory experiments setup in this study a layered porous media system was designed and used to experimentally investigate the asymmetrical dispersive transport behavior as shown in fig 2 the lpm system consists of a syringe pump a sand column and an automatic particle collector the sand column which of 42 5 cm in length and 2 5 cm in inner diameter is the main part of the system the whole column contains adjacent segments of the coarse grain layer c and fine grain layer f a sharp interface exists between the layers and perpendiculars to the flow direction the fill materials in the layers included two sizes of standard quartz sand with mean grain sizes d of 0 36 mm and 0 12 mm corresponding to two size classes xu et al 2006 the porosity n of the coarse and fine grain layers are 0 41 and 0 43 the hydraulic conductivity of each layer is estimated by the kozeny carmen equation 1 k ρ w g μ n 3 1 n 2 d 2 180 where the ρ w is the fluid density ml 3 μ is the fluid kinematic viscosity mt 3l 1 the hydraulic conductivity lt 1 of the coarse grain layer kc and fine grain layer kf is 7 67 10 4 m s and 3 43 10 4 m s the triphenylmethane dye brilliant blue fcf erioglaucine disodium salt c37h34n2na2o9s3 with a concentration of c0 10 mg l was used as a conservative contaminant however the contaminant in natural systems could react with other solutes or even porous media this study focused mainly on the asymmetrical mass transfer and internal processes in lpm therefore the contamination is limited to an ideal non reactive solute solute was continuously injected into the lpm under a saturated condition the solute transports were considered in two opposite directions from the coarse grain layer to the fine grain layer c f direction and from the fine grain layer to the coarse grain layer f c direction the flow rate was controlled at a steady value of 0 3 ml min by a syringe pump at the outlet of the lpm column the solute was collected periodically by an automatic part collector sbs 100 huxi china over the entire period of the experiment each temporally separated by δt 10 min then an ultraviolet visible light spectrophotometer dr5000 hach america was used to measure the absorbance ab of the solute sample at a wavelength of 630 nm through a batch experiment a line equation c 0 1909 ab r2 0 999 was found that can describe the relationship between the absorbance ab and the solute concentration c well when c 14 mg l in the batch experiments the brilliant blue fcf solute with a concentration gradient of 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 and 20 mg l was used and their absorbance value was measured based on the beer lambert law finally the absorbance of the solute was converted to real concentration this study used the dimensionless concentration c c0 data to calculate the btc for solute transport in the f c direction the inlet and outlet boundary conditions were reversed from the experiment in the c f direction and the above steps were repeated to finally obtain the btc 2 2 laboratory scale numerical simulations to fully investigate the fate of solute transport in lpms and understand the asymmetrical dispersive transport behavior both laboratory scale ls and pore scale ps numerical simulations were performed in this study an ls lpm which was consistent with the laboratory experiment column was generated and used in the ls numerical simulations the ls lpm was a composite porous column consisting of two half columns referring to the coarse grain layer and the fine grain layer the hydraulic parameters of the ls lpm were set to be equal to the hydraulic parameters of the sand column used in the laboratory experiment solute transport in lpm was simulated under consistent boundary conditions as in the laboratory experiment the solute with an initial concentration of c0 10 mg l was continuously injected into the ls lpm under a certain flow rate 0 3 ml min for ls simulation the flow field was obtained by solving the darcy equation and continuous equation eq 2 the conservative solute transport process in lpm was obtained by solving the darcy scale advection dispersion equation ds ade eq 3 2 u k h 0 3 c t u c d l c 0 where u v w is the velocity vector obtained by eq 2 lt 1 k is the hydraulic conductivity obtained by eq 1 lt 1 t is time t h is the hydraulic head l c is the concentration of solute ml 3 dl is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient l 2 t 1 as the aspect ratio of the sand column is 17 it is sufficiently large to justify the experiment as a one dimensional 1d treatment therefore this study considered the longitudinal dispersion in simulations only the longitudinal dispersion coefficient is given by 4 d l α l u d m where α l is the dispersivity obtained by laboratory experiments l u is the mean velocity magnitude lt 1 d m is the molecular diffusion coefficient l2t 1 and set to be 1 0 10 9 m2 s the d m value relates to the dissolved organic contaminant e g dichloroethene toluene mtbe ethylbenzene and xylene relevant to groundwater quality problems cussler 2009 2 3 pore scale numerical simulations to reveal the underlying mechanism of asymmetrical dispersive transport behavior and investigate the mixing process the pore scale two dimensional ps 2d lpms were generated to conduct solute transport simulations and obtain high resolution inner processes data meanwhile two kinds of ps 2d lpms i e homogeneous lpm and heterogeneous lpm were considered to assess the influence of pore structure heterogeneity on asymmetrical dispersive transport behavior in the homogeneous lpm the grains are uniformly distributed while grains are randomly distributed in the heterogeneous lpm as shown in fig 3 a b the ps 2d lpm consists of two distinct sections referred to as the coarse grain layer and the fine grain layer which have identical dimensions for ps 2d lpm the mean grain size and grain size ratio is set to be consistent with the value adopted in the laboratory experiments the circular grains are assumed to be the solid phase the mean grain size for coarse and fine grains is 0 36 mm and 0 12 mm respectively which corresponds to a ratio of mean fine grain size to mean coarse grain size of 1 to 3 the overall dimensions of the ps 2d lpm are 14 94 4 97 mm2 in the homogeneous lpm the grains are uniformly distributed in the domain and the grain size of the coarse or fine grains is fixed while in the heterogeneous lpm the grains are randomly distributed in the domain meanwhile the grain size in a single layer of heterogeneous lpm follows a tracked truncated lognormal distribution this feature is consistent with the natural soil porous media the location of grains in the heterogeneous lpm is determined by a random procedure proposed by dou et al 2022 the randomly distributed grains form tortuous pore spaces and flow paths the pore scale aqueous solute transport model was used to simulate solute transport in 2d ps lpms the aqueous flow field was solved directly using the continuity equation eq 5 and the navier stokes equation eq 6 under isothermal incompressible newtonian and steady state flow conditions 5 u 0 6 ρ w u u μ u p for the concentration field of the aqueous miscible solute the advection diffusion equation was used 7 c t u c d m c 0 where c is the aqueous miscible solute concentration m l 3 and the 2d velocity tensor u l t 1 is determined by the numerical solution of eq 7 and eqs 5 6 the dimensionless time pore volume was adopted and given as 8 pv q t a where q is the flow rate l2t 1 a is the area of pore space in lpm l2 a validation case see support information was conducted and compared with the theoretical results which validate the correctness of the numerical model the galerkin finite element software package comsol multiphysics comsol inc burlington ma usa was used to conduct the laboratory scale and pore scale solute transport simulations the mesh independence analysis was conducted to ensure numerical stability and accuracy for laboratory scale simulations the mesh size was set to range from 0 25 mm to 2 5 mm and there was a total of 216 971 elements for pore scale simulations the mesh size was set to range from 0 0002 mm to 0 1 mm and there was a total of 462 850 elements 3 results and discussion 3 1 laboratory scale solute transport and inversion flux weighted btcs at the outlet boundary were measured see fig 4 a discrepancy is observed between the btcs for the c f direction and the f c direction despite the experiments being conducted in the same column and under identical boundary conditions even though a smaller grain size contrast was used in this study compared to berkowitz et al 2009 the observed discrepancy between btcs remained consistent the discrepancy between the btcs performed in two opposite flow directions was also observed under different flow conditions see chen et al 2022 the btc for the f c direction shows an earlier breakthrough time compared to the btc for the c f direction in other words the solute plume migrates faster when transporting through the fine grain layer to the coarse grains than in the reverse direction i e c f direction however conventional studies generally assume the same solute transport process in the same porous medium without considering the flow direction as an influencing factor furthermore a clear behavior of the long tail a significant feature of non fickain solute transport can be observed in btcs of both flow directions the non fickain solute transport behavior can be attributed to the heterogeneous pore space specifically the presence of interfaces this point will be further discussed in a pore scale study the classical 1d advection dispersion equation ade model was employed inversely to fit the btcs obtained from laboratory experiments the cxtfit code in the stanmod software toride et al 1995 was used for inverse calculations although the 1d ade model is based on fick s law which assumes that the dispersive mass flux is proportional to the first order spatial derivative of the concentration this study used the 1d ade model to demonstrate the deviation of mass transfer in lpms from identical mass transfer in homogeneous porous media since the interface between layers can affect the mass transfer and cause the spatial derivative of concentration to deviate from the first order in addition the results can be used to quantify the influence of flow direction on the solute transport process in lpm for the 1d ade model the corresponding analytical solution for continuous injection is given by 9 c l t c 0 2 e r f c l u f t 2 d l t e x p u f l d l e r f c l u f t 2 d l t where c0 is the initial concentration of solute lt 3 the u f is the fitted average solute transport velocity lt 1 dl is the fitted longitudinal effective dispersion coefficient l2t 1 erfc is the complementary error function l is the length of the sand column l the fitting results are summarized in table 1 and the fitting curves are shown in fig 4 for both flow directions the fitting curves cannot perfectly match the experimental btcs in particular the long tail of btc is not accurately captured however there is an offset between the two fitting curves suggesting that the solute plume in lpm migrates at different velocities the fitted value of u f for the f c direction is larger than the u f for the c f direction the overall effective dispersivity α l was calculated for two flow directions using eq 4 despite the lpm column and the flow rate u for both flow directions remain identical in this study a larger α l is determined for the f c direction compared to the c f direction indicating that the solutes distribute more broadly when the solute plume flows out of the lpm it has been confirmed that the α l is not a constant value during the solute transport process α l increases with the flow rate or solute migration distance chen et al 2008 pérez guerrero and skaggs 2010 some recent studies dou et al 2022 zhuang et al 2021 have investigated the effects of saturation on α l however to our knowledge there are currently few reports on the influence of flow direction on the α l the mechanism of how flow direction affects α l is unclear and requires further investigation however for the forward questions i e predicting contaminant migration in the soil or aquifer using the standard ds ade the results may not differ in terms of solute arrival time or btc shapes as can be seen in fig 4 the btcs obtained by laboratory scale simulations agree on two flow directions this can be attributed to the fact that the flux j x t at the interface of the layers is assumed to be continuous and of fickian type 10 j x t u c x t α l u d m c x t x under this flux condition the dispersivity α l is a constant value for both flow directions therefore the solute concentration calculated at the outlet boundary does not change when the flow direction is reversed it is essential to carefully choose the appropriate value of α l when predicting solute transport in lpm and to take into account the influence of the flow direction 3 2 pore scale fluid flow in lpms the flow field in the pore space determines the evolution of solute mass transfer in lpm the flow fields were quantified to investigate how flow direction affects the mesoscopic behavior of mass transfer in lpm from the perspective of the pore scale fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of the dimensionless flow velocity magnitude u u in the homogeneous a and the heterogeneous d lpms the probability density functions pdf of u u in two lpms and of the u u in a single layer are also illustrated in fig 5 b e and c f for both lpm and single lager the pdf of u u can be approximated by the following gamma distribution 11 p u u u u α 1 v 0 γ α e u u v 0 where the exponent α represents the pore connectivity coefficient and ranges from 2 to 2 holzner et al 2015 the v0 represents a characteristic mean pore velocity carrel et al 2018 as shown in fig 5 the pdf of u u in the heterogeneous lpm can be well approximated by eq 11 the parameters α and v0 for lpms and single layers obtained by fitting the pdfs of u u with the gamma distribution function however the gamma distribution function failed to capture the pdf of u u in the homogeneous lpm the tortuosity t was calculated to evaluate the variations in flow fields under different flow directions and heterogeneities tortuosity can quantitatively characterize the complexity of flow paths in pore space and is defined as t u v where u denotes the average flow velocity of the fluid and v denotes the average flow velocity of the water in the longitudinal direction the results of α v0 and t for each case are summarized in table 2 for both the homogeneous lpm and heterogeneous lpm the flow fields did not change with the flow direction this is evident in fig 5 b e where the pdfs of the dimensionless flow velocity u u show nearly identical velocity distributions for both flow directions meanwhile the value of α v0 and t indicate that the flow direction has no effect on the flow field in lpms therefore it is unable to directly predict the asymmetrical dispersive transport behavior in lpm only relying on the properties of the flow field for different flow directions however the fate of solute transport depends strongly on the history of deformation dispersion and mixing in other words the sequence in which the solute passes through different layers can significantly affect the final state of the solute the behavior of the solute plume at the interface is jointly affected by the flow field on both sides of the interface hereinafter the flow field in each layer was quantitatively evaluated the spatial distribution of u u in the coarse and fine grain layers show considerable differences compared with the coarse grain layer the pdf of u u in the fine grain layer exhibit a substantial increase in the ratio of low and high flow velocity the α in the fine grain layer is smaller than the α in the coarse layer indicating poor connectivity in the fine grain layer the overall connectivity in lpm is greatly affected by the fine grain layer resulting in a value of 0 93 moreover for the heterogeneous lpm the t in the fine grain layer is larger than that in the coarse grain layer indicating more complex and tortuous flow paths the characteristic mean pore velocity v0 in the fine grain layer is significantly increased compared to the v0 in the coarse grain layer the fluid flow tends to accelerate in a narrow throat which is even narrower and more widely distributed in the fine grain layer the effect of heterogeneity on the flow field also needs to be considered as it can further enhance the shift of btc when the flow direction differs influenced by the complex pore structure caused by the random distribution of grains the flow field in the heterogeneous lpm becomes increasingly non uniform there are preferential flow paths with high velocity and randomly scattered stationary regions with low velocity in the heterogeneous lpm it is found that the tortuosity increases with increasing the heterogeneity of lpm the overall tortuosity of the heterogeneous lpm is 30 39 higher compared to the tortuosity of the homogeneous lpm furthermore in the heterogeneous lpm the tortuosity of the coarse grain layer increases by 29 4 while the tortuosity of the fine grain layer increases by 31 3 3 3 pore scale solute transport in lpms fig 6 shows the btcs obtained from pore scale simulations for two lpms consistent with the laboratory scale results pore scale simulations demonstrate a shift in btcs between the c f and f c directions earlier first breakthrough time and larger peak in btc are shown in the btc for the f c direction the deviations in btcs are more pronounced for heterogeneous lpm the peclet number which reflects the relative importance of the advective and diffusive mass transfer was calculated for all cases and summarized in table 2 the peclet number defined as pe t d t a is the ratio of the characteristic diffusive time t d d 2 d m to the characteristic advective time t a d u in this study the pe is above 1 suggesting that solute transport is dominated by advection furthermore the pe is higher in the coarse grain layer compared to the fine grained layer indicating that the contribution of convection dispersion is relatively stronger in the coarse grain layer additionally the pe increases with the heterogeneity of lpm in order to investigate how flow direction affects asymmetrical dispersive transport behavior in lpm a mass transfer index ε was proposed to capture the mass transfer evolution in lpm and given by 12 ε m 1 m total ω 1 c d ω ω 1 c d ω ω 2 c d ω where ω 1 represents the first layer that solute transport through in lpm the m1 is the mass resident in the first layer the mtotal is the mass resident in the whole lpm and equals the initial mass before the solute flows out of the lpm therefore ε could reflect the mass transfer between two layers and the development of mass across the interface before the solute flows out of the lpm after the solute flows out of the lpm ε indicates the relative distribution of residual solute mass in the different layers fig 7 shows the evolution of ε with dimensionless time and the corresponding concentration fields c c0 for three characteristic moments pv 0 2 0 5 1 0 which represent the different stages of solute plume distribution in lpms the selected characteristic moments represent the different stages of solute plume transport in lpms including 1 the solute plume transport in the first layer 2 the solute plume across the interface and 3 the solute plume flow out of the lpm for both homogeneous lpm and heterogeneous lpm the mass transfer process and solute concentration in the same lpm vary significantly depending on the direction of flow the results directly reveal the non negligible effects of the sequence of solutes crossing the layers on the fate of the solute initially i e t 0 2 pv the solute plume only exists in the first layer the solute shows a more elongated plume in the longitudinal direction when it transports from coarse to fine grain layer especially in the heterogeneous lpm the longer plume contributes to the solute entering the second layer earlier than the solute transport in the f c direction this phenomenon is also reflected in the curve of ε and is more pronounced in the heterogeneous lpm the ε for the c f direction decreases earlier than that for the f c direction this can be attributed to the fact that the solute plume is rapidly stretched and deformed by a strong convection effect i e larger pe in the coarse grain layer meanwhile the longer plume and irregular shape increase the interfacial area between solute and water resulting in more effective exchange of the solute mass in the fluids therefore during the solute across the interface i e t 0 5 pv the coarse grains layer c f direction shows a more uniform concentration gradient and a relatively low peak concentration compared to the fine grains layer f c direction it is interesting to note that for the c f direction the interface limits the solute to pass through although the solute plume arrives at the interface and enters the second layer earlier when it transports in the c f direction the overall rate of solute mass entering the second layer is slower this distinction is evident in the slope of the ε curve which is greater for the f c direction compared to the c f direction moreover a long tail of the ε curve for the c f direction is observed with increasing time this limiting effect can be attributed to the abrupt narrowing of the pore space at the interface as the pore connectivity coefficient α illustrated before the connectivity decreases rapidly the insets of the concentration fields also indicate the limiting effect which results in solute accumulation in the coarse grain layer see t 1 0 pv even after the solute plume crosses the interface a considerable area in the coarse layer remains occupied by solute mass gradually releasing into the fine grain layer in contrast for the f c direction the solute plume maintains a uniform shape in the fine grain layer and then easily across the interface and enters the coarse layer subsequently the plume rapidly transports along preferential flow paths and flows out of the lpm resulting in an earlier break of btc the deviations in solute transport behavior between two flow directions become more pronounced with increasing the heterogeneity of lpm the deviation of the mass across the interface between two flow directions significantly affects the solute distribution which in turn leads to differences in solute mixing behavior in the pore space 3 4 impacts of flow directions on solute mixing in lpms the volumetric dilution index e t a parameter introduced by kitanidis 1994 can be used to quantify true solute mixing behavior it is important to distinguish true solute mixing from spreading which is caused by the variability of the flow field spreading can lead to the squeezing stretching and meandering of a solute plume but does not directly contribute to physical mixing however the true mixing process is only related to diffusion and yields an effective exchange between solute mass in fluids which affects the peak concentration of a solute plume recently the dilution index has been widely adopted to analyze the solute mixing behavior under a pules injection chiogna et al 2011 rolle et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 e t is based on the shannon entropy and represents the distribution of a solute mass over an increased volume 13 e t exp ω p x t ln p x t d ω 14 p x t c x t ω c x t d ω where p x t l 3 is the concentration probability distribution defined over a volume v l3 to investigate the mechanism of asymmetrical dispersive transport behavior in lpms the e t was calculated for the solute transport processes in the lpms the temporal solute mixing behaviors under different flow directions are shown in fig 8 the results show that solute mixing is enhanced in the c f direction compared to the f c direction as evidenced by higher e t values in the former before solute flows out of the homogeneous lpm i e 1 0 pv the maximum e t in the c f direction is 1 12 times the maximum e t in the f c direction while in heterogeneous lpm the difference can reach 1 31 times this suggests that there is more volume occupied by the solute in other words a higher degree of mixing when solute transport occurs in the c f direction the heterogeneity of the lpm also significantly enhances the mixing process with consistently larger the e t values in the heterogeneous lpm compared to the homogeneous lpm specifically for the f c direction the maximum e t in the heterogeneous lpm increased by 64 compared to the homogeneous lpm moreover when considering the combined influence of the c f direction the increment can reach 92 the deviation of solute mixing behavior can be attributed to the combined effect of strong advective mass transfer i e larger pe in coarse layer and the limiting effect of interface on solute across the layers under c f direction when solute first enters the coarse layer it undergoes rapid stretching and deforming due to the strong convection leading to an increased contact area between the solute plume and water it has been confirmed in previous studies that high pe can promote mixing in previous studies rolle et al 2013 additionally the interface limits the mass release from the coarse layer to the fine layer which increases the exchange between the solute and pure water resulting in a significant reduction in concentration however for the f c direction the solute plume first transports in the fine grain layer where the solute keeps a uniform distribution and easily across the layers in the f c direction this explains why the peak concentration of btc is higher in the f c direction than that in the c f direction 4 summary and conclusions in this study the asymmetrical mass transfer and solute mixing process in layered porous media were comprehensively investigated through a combination of laboratory experiments and pore scale numerical simulations the laboratory experiment emphasized that the solute transport in the same lpm is flow direction dependent pore scale simulations were employed to simulate solute transport in both homogeneous and heterogeneous lpm providing detailed insights into flow and solute transport within the pore space a mass transfer index was proposed to quantitatively characterize the mass transfer behavior in lpm under different flow directions the associated solute mixing process which determines the contaminant evolution was evaluated through the dilution index this study revealed that the history of solute across layers plays a crucial role in solute transport which determines the fate of contaminants in lpm the main finding of this work can be summarized by the laboratory experiment results were analyzed to determine the effective dispersion coefficient dl which was found to be larger in the c f direction compared to the f c direction it can be contributed that the interface limited the mass transfer during solute transport in the c f direction therefore it is essential to consider the direction related α l for predicting contaminant transport when using the darcy ade model the flow field in the fine grains layer was more tortuous and exhibited a higher proportion of low and high velocities the abrupt change of flow fields between two layers directly controlled the mass transfer at the interface however from the perspective of the entire lpm the overall flow characteristic i e α v0 and t was insensitive to the flow direction consequently the asymmetrical dispersive transport behavior cannot be predicted directly from the characteristics of the flow fields the results of the pore scale concentration fields and ε directly confirmed that the interface limits the solute to pass through such limiting effect altered when the flow direction was reversed and it was more evident in the c f flow direction although the solute arrived at the interface earlier due to the better connectivity i e larger α and stronger convection effect i e larger pe in the coarse grain layer a long tail of the ε curve for the c f direction was observed especially for heterogeneous lpm indicating the slow release of the solute from the first layer to the second layer it was found that the mixing behavior in lpm is not constant and strongly depends on the flow direction the maximum dilution index e t for the c f direction was 1 31 times larger than that for the f c direction indicating that the mixing process was significantly enhanced this can be attributed to the limiting effect and slow release process of solute from the coarse grain layer to the fine grain layer the enhanced mixing behavior led to a decrease in the peak concentration of btc overall this study sheds light on the intricate dynamics of mass transfer across the lpm and the potential effects on solute mixing when the flow direction is inversed while 2d simulation is sufficient to understand asymmetrical mass transfer in natural environments the lpm may have more complex topology and structural contrasts with the pore space that evolves in 3d under these circumstances the mass transfer behavior and mixing process may be more uncertain further work is necessary to develop a theoretical framework that incorporates the effects of interfaces and flow directions into the mass transfer model to achieve this 3d micro scale solute transport investigations will be conducted in future work credit authorship contribution statement xueyi zhang

1753,natural sediments or aquifers frequently exhibit layering and structural contrasts which give rise to anomalous mass transfer behavior moreover the effects of the interface on mass transfer and mixing in layered porous media lpm may be different when the flow direction is reversed resulting in asymmetrical dispersive transport and a significant disparity between predictions and actual observations despite its importance the underlying mechanism remains an open question to address this gap laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were conducted the results demonstrated that the effective dispersion coefficient is larger when the solute migrates from the coarse grain layer to the fine grain layer c f direction compared to the f c direction the history of the solute across the interface and the flow adjacent to the interface affect this deviation pore scale simulations revealed a more tortuous flow field with a higher proportion of low and high velocities in the fine grain layer although the velocity characteristics of the entire lpm were insensitive to flow direction measuring the velocity characteristics of lpm alone is insufficient to predict the asymmetrical dispersive transport behavior to quantitatively evaluate mass transfer between layers and residual contaminants in lpm a mass transfer index ε was introduced the results of ε along with the pore scale concentration directly indicated that the interface limited the mass transfer the effect was more pronounced in the c f direction and particularly evident in the heterogeneous lpm which ultimately enhanced the solute mixing in the heterogenous lpm the maximum dilution index for the c f direction is 1 31 times larger than that for the f c direction the findings contribute to a better

solute transport is commonly encountered in natural systems and widely employed in industrial production understanding the mechanisms of mass transfer and solute mixing process in porous media especially in highly heterogeneous porous media is of fundamental importance in many fields for example chemical engineering chen et al 2018 geochemical processes soltanian et al 2015 environmental microbiology de anna et al 2020 scheidweiler et al 2020 carbon capture and storage an et al 2021 song et al 2016 and oil recovery bijeljic et al 2011 huber et al 2014 pore size or morphological diversity due to the disordered pore structures results in the flow velocity with spatial and temporal variations in heterogeneous porous media which in turn determine the fate of contaminant migration in hyporheic zone sediments or aquifers brusseau 2020 dou et al 2022 prommer et al 2019 accurate description or prediction of the contaminant migration in hyporheic zone sediments hester et al 2017 lu et al 2022 or aquifers rolle and le borgne 2019 yang et al 2015 zhan et al 2009a has been a constant concern but a challenging work the lpm refers to the porous media that consists of contrasting pore space structures and hydraulic properties in different layers or regions liang et al 2019 as shown in fig 1 the lpm system is widely distributed in natural sediments or aquifers and can be regarded as a typical type of highly heterogeneous porous media at the macroscopic scale for example the low permeability zone scattered in aquifers yang et al 2015 the aquifer aquitard system li et al 2021 zhan et al 2009b and the fracture rock matrix system wang et al 2022 furthermore the wide application of lpm has garnered significant interest from researchers across diverse fields the effects of lpm on flow and solute transport have found extensive practical use in various engineering applications alemany et al 2022 asiaei et al 2019 siavashi et al 2018 due to the abrupt change in properties at the interface the fluid flow and mass transfer behavior tend to be anomalous and hard to predict krishna et al 2021 krishna et al 2020 for instance the flow near a pumping well is initially a non darcian flow region and then transits to be a darcian flow region wen et al 2008 at the bottom of the riverbed a transition layer exists which is characterized by a drastic decrease of velocity as a matching zone between the surface free fluid and sediments goharzadeh et al 2005 meanwhile the flow in such a transition layer is no longer laminar but an extension of turbulent flow in the surface free fluid the flow in this area strongly controls the release or trapping of mass resulting in the early break or heavy tail in the breakthrough curve kim and kang 2020 although the above studies were carried out in the free fluid porous media system they emphasized the influence of the interface on flow and mass transfer several studies have investigated fluid flow in lpm and have highlighted the substantial influence of interfaces on internal pressure dynamics li et al 2018 shokri et al 2010 zhang et al 2022 in hydrogeology studies the impact of interfaces on solute transport in accurately predicting contaminant migration has been relatively overlooked despite its potential significance to model anomalous transport across an interface marseguerra and zoia 2006 proposed a monte carlo approach their scheme could simulate a neat jump in resident concentration by varying the local velocity when particles cross the interface berkowitz et al 2009 experimentally investigated the interfacial solute transport across the lpm using sands packed column and observed a significant asymmetrical dispersive transport as shown in fig 1 they argued that the phenomenon breakthrough curve btc depends on the flow direction is related to solute accumulation at the interface meanwhile this anomalous transport could not be explained by macroscopic parameters cortis and zoia 2009 proposed a modified continuous time random walk formulation in which particles have different probabilities of moving forward or backward when solute is transported in different directions other recent experimental studies related to solute transport in lpm have focused on the solute loading and unloading processes erfani et al 2021 the influence of the transition layer chen et al 2022 and dispersion dejam and hassanzadeh 2022 more recently the microfluid model has been employed to investigate mass exchange across interfaces providing pore scale information that explains the slow release of contamination in layered porous media walczak et al 2022 however neither the analytical approach nor the experiment can measure fluid flow and mass transfer processes in the pore space and thus cannot directly prove that mass accumulates at the interface moreover to our best knowledge the study related to mixing behavior in lpm is still lacking mixing is the process that homogenizes initially segregated miscible constituents and affects the solute transport behavior in porous media heyman et al 2021 souzy et al 2020 valocchi et al 2018 including dispersion dilution and reaction for reactive species mixing facilitates chemical reactions and therefore plays a key role in contaminant migration in sediments or aquifers dentz et al 2018 considerable efforts have been made de dreuzy and carrera 2016 heyman et al 2021 rolle and kitanidis 2014 to investigate the influence of porous media structure and flow behavior on mixing the complex pore space structure at the pore scale and the spatial variability of hydraulic properties at the field scale both contribute to the mixing as pointed out above interface and flow direction have a significant effect on the solute transport in lpm flow direction therefore has the potential to influence mixing behavior and alter the final state of contaminant in geologic lpm including the contaminant distribution chemical composition and concentration it has been confirmed that the fate of solute is strongly dependent on the mixing history le borgne et al 2015 villermaux 2019 however the question of how the interface affects solute mixing in lpm with different flow directions is still open to address this gap both laboratory experiments and pore scale numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the mechanics of the asymmetrical dispersive transport and solute mixing process in lpm under different flow directions benefiting from the high resolution of measurement and well controlled experimental conditions pore scale modeling could provide fundamental insight for understanding macroscale phenomena jiménez martínez et al 2017 wang et al 2020 xing et al 2021 zheng et al 2022 zhou et al 2019 most of the above studies focused on single porous media and did not consider the influence of flow direction on solute transport in lpm the rest of this paper is organized as follows first the experimental setup and simulation strategy are described in section 2 the results derived from the laboratory scale and pore scale investigations are shown and discussed in section 3 in section 4 the summary and conclusion are presented 2 methodology and modeling 2 1 laboratory experiments setup in this study a layered porous media system was designed and used to experimentally investigate the asymmetrical dispersive transport behavior as shown in fig 2 the lpm system consists of a syringe pump a sand column and an automatic particle collector the sand column which of 42 5 cm in length and 2 5 cm in inner diameter is the main part of the system the whole column contains adjacent segments of the coarse grain layer c and fine grain layer f a sharp interface exists between the layers and perpendiculars to the flow direction the fill materials in the layers included two sizes of standard quartz sand with mean grain sizes d of 0 36 mm and 0 12 mm corresponding to two size classes xu et al 2006 the porosity n of the coarse and fine grain layers are 0 41 and 0 43 the hydraulic conductivity of each layer is estimated by the kozeny carmen equation 1 k ρ w g μ n 3 1 n 2 d 2 180 where the ρ w is the fluid density ml 3 μ is the fluid kinematic viscosity mt 3l 1 the hydraulic conductivity lt 1 of the coarse grain layer kc and fine grain layer kf is 7 67 10 4 m s and 3 43 10 4 m s the triphenylmethane dye brilliant blue fcf erioglaucine disodium salt c37h34n2na2o9s3 with a concentration of c0 10 mg l was used as a conservative contaminant however the contaminant in natural systems could react with other solutes or even porous media this study focused mainly on the asymmetrical mass transfer and internal processes in lpm therefore the contamination is limited to an ideal non reactive solute solute was continuously injected into the lpm under a saturated condition the solute transports were considered in two opposite directions from the coarse grain layer to the fine grain layer c f direction and from the fine grain layer to the coarse grain layer f c direction the flow rate was controlled at a steady value of 0 3 ml min by a syringe pump at the outlet of the lpm column the solute was collected periodically by an automatic part collector sbs 100 huxi china over the entire period of the experiment each temporally separated by δt 10 min then an ultraviolet visible light spectrophotometer dr5000 hach america was used to measure the absorbance ab of the solute sample at a wavelength of 630 nm through a batch experiment a line equation c 0 1909 ab r2 0 999 was found that can describe the relationship between the absorbance ab and the solute concentration c well when c 14 mg l in the batch experiments the brilliant blue fcf solute with a concentration gradient of 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 and 20 mg l was used and their absorbance value was measured based on the beer lambert law finally the absorbance of the solute was converted to real concentration this study used the dimensionless concentration c c0 data to calculate the btc for solute transport in the f c direction the inlet and outlet boundary conditions were reversed from the experiment in the c f direction and the above steps were repeated to finally obtain the btc 2 2 laboratory scale numerical simulations to fully investigate the fate of solute transport in lpms and understand the asymmetrical dispersive transport behavior both laboratory scale ls and pore scale ps numerical simulations were performed in this study an ls lpm which was consistent with the laboratory experiment column was generated and used in the ls numerical simulations the ls lpm was a composite porous column consisting of two half columns referring to the coarse grain layer and the fine grain layer the hydraulic parameters of the ls lpm were set to be equal to the hydraulic parameters of the sand column used in the laboratory experiment solute transport in lpm was simulated under consistent boundary conditions as in the laboratory experiment the solute with an initial concentration of c0 10 mg l was continuously injected into the ls lpm under a certain flow rate 0 3 ml min for ls simulation the flow field was obtained by solving the darcy equation and continuous equation eq 2 the conservative solute transport process in lpm was obtained by solving the darcy scale advection dispersion

is the concentration of solute ml 3 dl is the longitudinal dispersion coefficient l 2 t 1 as the aspect ratio of the sand column is 17 it is sufficiently large to justify the experiment as a one

dissolved organic contaminant e g dichloroethene toluene mtbe ethylbenzene and xylene relevant to groundwater quality problems cussler 2009 2 3 pore scale numerical simulations to reveal the underlying mechanism of asymmetrical dispersive transport behavior and investigate the mixing process the pore scale two dimensional ps 2d lpms were generated to conduct solute transport simulations and obtain high resolution inner processes data meanwhile two kinds of ps 2d lpms i e homogeneous lpm and heterogeneous lpm were considered to assess the influence of pore structure heterogeneity on asymmetrical dispersive transport behavior in the homogeneous lpm the grains are uniformly distributed while grains are randomly distributed in the heterogeneous lpm as shown in fig 3 a b the ps 2d lpm consists of two distinct sections referred to as the coarse grain layer and the fine grain layer which have identical dimensions for ps 2d lpm the mean grain size and grain size ratio is set to be consistent with the value adopted in the laboratory experiments the circular grains are assumed to be the solid phase the mean grain size for coarse and fine grains is 0 36 mm and 0 12 mm respectively which corresponds to a ratio of mean fine grain size to mean coarse grain size of 1 to 3 the overall dimensions of the ps 2d lpm are 14 94 4 97 mm2 in the homogeneous lpm the grains are uniformly distributed in the domain and the grain size of the coarse or fine grains is fixed while in the heterogeneous lpm the grains are randomly distributed in the domain meanwhile the grain size in a single layer of heterogeneous lpm follows a tracked truncated lognormal distribution this feature is consistent with the natural soil porous media the location of grains in the heterogeneous lpm is determined by a random procedure proposed by dou et al 2022 the randomly distributed grains form tortuous pore spaces and flow paths the pore scale aqueous solute transport model was used to simulate solute transport in 2d ps lpms the aqueous flow field was solved directly using the continuity equation eq 5 and the navier stokes equation eq 6 under isothermal incompressible newtonian and steady state flow conditions 5 u 0 6 ρ w u u μ u p for the concentration field of the aqueous miscible solute the advection diffusion equation was used 7 c t u c d m c 0 where c is the aqueous miscible solute concentration m l 3 and the 2d velocity tensor u l t 1 is determined by the numerical solution of eq 7 and eqs 5 6 the dimensionless time pore volume was adopted and given as 8 pv q t a where q is the flow rate l2t 1 a is the area of pore space in lpm l2 a validation case see support information was conducted and compared with the theoretical results which validate the correctness of the numerical model the galerkin finite element software package comsol multiphysics comsol inc burlington ma usa was used to conduct the laboratory scale and pore scale solute transport simulations the mesh independence analysis was conducted to ensure numerical stability and accuracy for laboratory scale simulations the mesh size was set to range from 0 25 mm to 2 5 mm and there was a total of 216 971 elements for pore scale simulations the mesh size was set to range from 0 0002 mm to 0 1 mm and there was a total of 462 850 elements 3 results and discussion 3 1 laboratory scale solute transport and inversion flux weighted btcs at the outlet boundary were measured see fig 4 a discrepancy is observed between the btcs for the c f direction and the f c direction despite the experiments being conducted in the same column and under identical boundary conditions even though a smaller grain size contrast was used in this study compared to berkowitz et al 2009 the observed discrepancy between btcs remained consistent the discrepancy between the btcs performed in two opposite flow directions was also observed under different flow conditions see chen et al 2022 the btc for the f c direction shows an earlier breakthrough time compared to the btc for the c f direction in other words the solute plume migrates faster when transporting through the fine grain layer to the coarse grains than in the reverse direction i e c f direction however conventional studies generally assume the same solute transport process in the same porous medium without considering the flow direction as an influencing factor furthermore a clear behavior of the long tail a significant feature of non fickain solute transport can be observed in btcs of both flow directions the non fickain solute transport behavior can be attributed to the heterogeneous pore space specifically the presence of interfaces this point will be further discussed in a pore scale study the classical 1d advection dispersion equation ade model was employed inversely to fit the btcs obtained from laboratory experiments the cxtfit code in the stanmod software toride et al 1995 was used for inverse calculations although the 1d ade model is based on fick s law which assumes that the dispersive mass flux is proportional to the first order spatial derivative of the concentration this study used the 1d ade model to demonstrate the deviation of mass transfer in lpms from identical mass transfer in homogeneous porous media since the interface between layers can affect the mass transfer and cause the spatial derivative of concentration to deviate from the first order in addition the results can be used to quantify the influence of flow direction on the solute transport process in lpm for the 1d ade model the corresponding analytical solution for continuous injection is given by 9 c l t c 0 2 e r f c l u f t 2 d l t e x p u f l d l e r f c l u f t 2 d l t where c0 is the initial concentration of solute lt 3 the u f is the fitted average solute transport velocity lt 1 dl is the fitted longitudinal effective dispersion coefficient l2t 1 erfc is the complementary error function l is the length of the sand column l the fitting results are summarized in table 1 and the fitting curves are shown in fig 4 for both flow directions the fitting curves cannot perfectly match the experimental btcs in particular the long tail of btc is not accurately captured however there is an offset between the two fitting curves suggesting that the solute plume in lpm migrates at different velocities the fitted value of u f for the f c direction is larger than the u f for the c f direction the overall effective dispersivity α l was calculated for two flow directions using eq 4 despite the lpm column and the flow rate u for both flow directions remain identical in this study a larger α l is determined for the f c direction compared to the c f direction indicating that the solutes distribute more broadly when the solute plume flows out of the lpm it has been confirmed that the α l is not a constant value during the solute transport process α l increases with the flow rate or solute migration distance chen et al 2008 pérez guerrero and skaggs 2010 some recent studies dou et al 2022 zhuang et al 2021 have investigated the effects of saturation on α l however to our knowledge there are currently few reports on the influence of flow direction on the α l the mechanism of how flow direction affects α l is unclear and requires further investigation however for the forward questions i e predicting contaminant migration in the soil or aquifer using the standard ds ade the results may not differ in terms of solute arrival time or btc shapes as can be seen in fig 4 the btcs obtained by laboratory scale simulations agree on two flow directions this can be attributed to the fact that the flux j x t at the interface of the layers is assumed to be continuous and of fickian type 10 j x t u c x t α l u d m c x t x under this flux condition the dispersivity α l is a constant value for both flow directions therefore the solute concentration calculated at the outlet boundary does not change when the flow direction is reversed it is essential to carefully choose the appropriate value of α l when predicting solute transport in lpm and to take into account the influence of the flow direction 3 2 pore scale fluid flow in lpms the flow field in the pore space determines the evolution of solute mass transfer in lpm the flow fields were quantified to investigate how flow direction affects the mesoscopic behavior of mass transfer in lpm from the perspective of the pore scale fig 5 shows the spatial distribution of the dimensionless flow velocity magnitude u u in the homogeneous a and the heterogeneous d lpms the probability density functions pdf of u u in two lpms and of the u u in a single layer are also illustrated in fig 5 b e and c f for both lpm and single lager the pdf of u u can be approximated by the following gamma distribution 11 p u u u u α 1 v 0 γ α e u u v 0 where the exponent α represents the pore connectivity coefficient and ranges from 2 to 2 holzner et al 2015 the v0 represents a characteristic mean pore velocity carrel et al 2018 as shown in fig 5 the pdf of u u in the heterogeneous lpm can be well approximated by eq 11 the parameters α and v0 for lpms and single layers obtained by fitting the pdfs of u u with the gamma distribution function however the gamma distribution function failed to capture the pdf of u u in the homogeneous lpm the tortuosity t was calculated to evaluate the variations in flow fields under different flow directions and heterogeneities tortuosity can quantitatively characterize the complexity of flow paths in pore space and is defined as t u v where u denotes the average flow velocity of the fluid and v denotes the average flow velocity of the water in the longitudinal direction the results of α v0 and t for each case are summarized in table 2 for both the homogeneous lpm and heterogeneous lpm the flow fields did not change with the flow direction this is evident in fig 5 b e where the pdfs of the dimensionless flow velocity u u show nearly identical velocity distributions for both flow directions meanwhile the value of α v0 and t indicate that the flow direction has no effect on the flow field in lpms therefore it is unable to directly predict the asymmetrical dispersive transport behavior in lpm only relying on the properties of the flow field for different flow directions however the fate of solute transport depends strongly on the history of deformation dispersion and mixing in other words the sequence in which the solute passes through different layers can significantly affect the final state of the solute the behavior of the solute plume at the interface is jointly affected by the flow field on both sides of the interface hereinafter the flow field in each layer was quantitatively evaluated the spatial distribution of u u in the coarse and fine grain layers show considerable differences compared with the coarse grain layer the pdf of u u in the fine grain layer exhibit a substantial increase in the ratio of low and high flow velocity the α in the fine grain layer is smaller than the α in the coarse layer indicating poor connectivity in the fine grain layer the overall connectivity in lpm is greatly affected by the fine grain layer resulting in a value of 0 93 moreover for the heterogeneous lpm the t in the fine grain layer is larger than that in the coarse grain layer indicating more complex and tortuous flow paths the characteristic mean pore velocity v0 in the fine grain layer is significantly increased compared to the v0 in the coarse grain layer the fluid flow tends to accelerate in a narrow throat which is even narrower and more widely distributed in the fine grain layer the effect of heterogeneity on the flow field also needs to be considered as it can further enhance the shift of btc when the flow direction differs influenced by the complex pore structure caused by the random distribution of grains the flow field in the heterogeneous lpm becomes increasingly non uniform there are preferential flow paths with high velocity and randomly scattered stationary regions with low velocity in the heterogeneous lpm it is found that the tortuosity increases with increasing the heterogeneity of lpm the overall tortuosity of the heterogeneous lpm is 30 39 higher compared to the tortuosity of the homogeneous lpm furthermore in the heterogeneous lpm the tortuosity of the coarse grain layer increases by 29 4 while the tortuosity of the fine grain layer increases by 31 3 3 3 pore scale solute transport in lpms fig 6 shows the btcs obtained from pore scale simulations for two lpms consistent with the laboratory scale results pore scale simulations demonstrate a shift in btcs between the c f and f c directions earlier first breakthrough time and larger peak in btc are shown in the btc for the f c direction the deviations in btcs are more pronounced for heterogeneous lpm the peclet number which reflects the relative importance of the advective and diffusive mass transfer was calculated for all cases and summarized in table 2 the peclet number defined as pe t d t a is the ratio of the characteristic diffusive time t d d 2 d m to the characteristic advective time t a d u in this study the pe is above 1 suggesting that solute transport is dominated by advection furthermore the pe is higher in the coarse grain layer compared to the fine grained layer indicating that the contribution of convection dispersion is relatively stronger in the coarse grain layer additionally the pe increases with the heterogeneity of lpm in order to investigate how flow direction affects asymmetrical dispersive transport behavior in lpm a mass transfer index ε was proposed to capture the mass transfer evolution in lpm and given by 12 ε m 1 m total ω 1 c d ω ω 1 c d ω ω 2 c d ω where ω 1 represents the first layer that solute transport through in lpm the m1 is the mass resident in the first layer the mtotal is the mass resident in the whole lpm and equals the initial mass before the solute flows out of the lpm therefore ε could reflect the mass transfer between two layers and the development of mass across the interface before the solute flows out of the lpm after the solute flows out of the lpm ε indicates the relative distribution of residual solute mass in the different layers fig 7 shows the evolution of ε with dimensionless time and the corresponding concentration fields c c0 for three characteristic moments pv 0 2 0 5 1 0 which represent the different stages of solute plume distribution in lpms the selected characteristic moments represent the different stages of solute plume transport in lpms including 1 the solute plume transport in the first layer 2 the solute plume across the interface and 3 the solute plume flow out of the lpm for both homogeneous lpm and heterogeneous lpm the mass transfer process and solute concentration in the same lpm vary significantly depending on the direction of flow the results directly reveal the non negligible effects of the sequence of solutes crossing the layers on the fate of the solute initially i e t 0 2 pv the solute plume only exists in the first layer the solute shows a more elongated plume in the longitudinal direction when it transports from coarse to fine grain layer especially in the heterogeneous lpm the longer plume contributes to the solute entering the second layer earlier than the solute transport in the f c direction this phenomenon is also reflected in the curve of ε and is more pronounced in the heterogeneous lpm the ε for the c f direction decreases earlier than that for the f c direction this can be attributed to the fact that the solute plume is rapidly stretched and deformed by a strong convection effect i e larger pe in the coarse grain layer meanwhile the longer plume and irregular shape increase the interfacial area between solute and water resulting in more effective exchange of the solute mass in the fluids therefore during the solute across the interface i e t 0 5 pv the coarse grains layer c f direction shows a more uniform concentration gradient and a relatively low peak concentration compared to the fine grains layer f c direction it is interesting to note that for the c f direction the interface limits the solute to pass through although the solute plume arrives at the interface and enters the second layer earlier when it transports in the c f direction the overall rate of solute mass entering the second layer is slower this distinction is evident in the slope of the ε curve which is greater for the f c direction compared to the c f direction moreover a long tail of the ε curve for the c f direction is observed with increasing time this limiting effect can be attributed to the abrupt narrowing of the pore space at the interface as the pore connectivity coefficient α illustrated before the connectivity decreases rapidly the insets of the concentration fields also indicate the limiting effect which results in solute accumulation in the coarse grain layer see t 1 0 pv even after the solute plume crosses the interface a considerable area in the coarse layer remains occupied by solute mass gradually releasing into the fine grain layer in contrast for the f c direction the solute plume maintains a uniform shape in the fine grain layer and then easily across the interface and enters the coarse layer subsequently the plume rapidly transports along preferential flow paths and flows out of the lpm resulting in an earlier break of btc the deviations in solute transport behavior between two flow directions become more pronounced with increasing the heterogeneity of lpm the deviation of the mass across the interface between two flow directions significantly affects the solute distribution which in turn leads to differences in solute mixing behavior in the pore space 3 4 impacts of flow directions on solute mixing in lpms the volumetric dilution index e t a parameter introduced by kitanidis 1994 can be used to quantify true solute mixing behavior it is important to distinguish true solute mixing from spreading which is caused by the variability of the flow field spreading can lead to the squeezing stretching and meandering of a solute plume but does not directly contribute to physical mixing however the true mixing process is only related to diffusion and yields an effective exchange between solute mass in fluids which affects the peak concentration of a solute plume recently the dilution index has been widely adopted to analyze the solute mixing behavior under a pules injection chiogna et al 2011 rolle et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 e t is based on the shannon entropy and represents the distribution of a solute mass over an increased volume 13 e t exp ω p x t ln p x t d ω 14 p x t c x t ω c x t d ω where p x t l 3 is the concentration probability distribution defined over a volume v l3 to investigate the mechanism of asymmetrical dispersive transport behavior in lpms the e t was calculated for the solute transport processes in the lpms the temporal solute mixing behaviors under different flow directions are shown in fig 8 the results show that solute mixing is enhanced in the c f direction compared to the f c direction as evidenced by higher e t values in the former before solute flows out of the homogeneous lpm i e 1 0 pv the maximum e t in the c f direction is 1 12 times the maximum e t in the f c direction while in heterogeneous lpm the difference can reach 1 31 times this suggests that there is more volume occupied by the solute in other words a higher degree of mixing when solute transport occurs in the c f direction the heterogeneity of the lpm also significantly enhances the mixing process with consistently larger the e t values in the heterogeneous lpm compared to the homogeneous lpm specifically for the f c direction the maximum e t in the heterogeneous lpm increased by 64 compared to the homogeneous lpm moreover when considering the combined influence of the c f direction the increment can reach 92 the deviation of solute mixing behavior can be attributed to the combined effect of strong advective mass transfer i e larger pe in coarse layer and the limiting effect of interface on solute across the layers under c f direction when solute first enters the coarse layer it undergoes rapid stretching and deforming due to the strong convection leading to an increased contact area between the solute plume and water it has been confirmed in previous studies that high pe can promote mixing in previous studies rolle et al 2013 additionally the interface limits the mass release from the coarse layer to the fine layer which increases the exchange between the solute and pure water resulting in a significant reduction in concentration however for the f c direction the solute plume first transports in the fine grain layer where the solute keeps a uniform distribution and easily across the layers in the f c direction this explains why the peak concentration of btc is higher in the f c direction than that in the c f direction 4 summary and conclusions in this study the asymmetrical mass transfer and solute mixing process in layered porous media were comprehensively investigated through a combination of laboratory experiments and pore scale numerical simulations the laboratory experiment emphasized that the solute transport in the same lpm is flow direction dependent pore scale simulations were employed to simulate solute transport in both homogeneous and heterogeneous lpm providing detailed insights into flow and solute transport within the pore space a mass transfer index was proposed to quantitatively characterize the mass transfer behavior in lpm under different flow directions the associated solute mixing process which determines the contaminant evolution was evaluated through the dilution index this study revealed that the history of solute across layers plays a crucial role in solute transport which determines the fate of contaminants in lpm the main finding of this work can be summarized by the laboratory experiment results were analyzed to determine the effective dispersion coefficient dl which was found to be larger in the c f direction compared to the f c direction it can be contributed that the interface limited the mass transfer during solute transport in the c f direction therefore it is essential to consider the direction related α l for predicting contaminant transport when using the darcy ade model the flow field in the fine grains layer was more tortuous and exhibited a higher proportion of low and high velocities the abrupt change of flow fields between two layers directly controlled the mass transfer at the interface however from the perspective of the entire lpm the overall flow characteristic i e α v0 and t was insensitive to the flow direction consequently the asymmetrical dispersive transport behavior cannot be predicted directly from the characteristics of the flow fields the results of the pore scale concentration fields and ε directly confirmed that the interface limits the solute to pass through such limiting effect altered when the flow direction was reversed and it was more evident in the c f flow direction although the solute arrived at the interface earlier due to the better connectivity i e larger α and stronger convection effect i e larger pe in the coarse grain layer a long tail of the ε curve for the c f direction was observed especially for heterogeneous lpm indicating the slow release of the solute from the first layer to the second layer it was found that the mixing behavior in lpm is not constant and strongly depends on the flow direction the maximum dilution index e t for the c f direction was 1 31 times larger than that for the f c direction indicating that the mixing process was significantly enhanced this can be attributed to the limiting effect and slow release process of solute from the coarse grain layer to the fine grain layer the enhanced mixing behavior led to a decrease in the peak concentration of btc overall this study sheds light on the intricate dynamics of mass transfer across the lpm and the potential effects on solute mixing when the flow direction is inversed while 2d simulation is sufficient to understand asymmetrical mass transfer in natural environments the lpm may have more complex topology and structural contrasts with the pore space that evolves in 3d under these circumstances the mass transfer behavior and mixing process may be more uncertain further work is necessary to develop a theoretical framework that incorporates the effects of interfaces and flow directions into the mass transfer model to achieve this 3d micro scale solute transport investigations will be conducted in future work credit authorship contribution statement xueyi zhang

1754,hydrological climate change impact studies depend on climatic variables simulated by climate models due to parametrization and numerous simplifications however climate model outputs come with systematic biases compared to the observations in the past decade several methods of different complexity and dimensionality for adjustment of such biases were introduced but their benefits for impact studies and accurate streamflow projections are still debated in this paper we evaluated the ability of two state of the art advanced multivariate bias adjustment methods to accurately reproduce 16 hydrological signatures and compared their performance against two parsimonious univariate bias adjustment methods based on a multi criteria performance evaluation the results indicated that all bias adjustment methods considerably reduced biases and increased the consistency of simulated hydrological signatures the added value of multivariate methods in maintaining dependence structures between precipitation and temperature was not systematically reflected in the resulting hydrological signatures as they were generally outperformed by univariate methods the benefits of multivariate methods only emerged for low flow signatures in snowmelt driven catchments based on these findings we identified the most suitable bias adjustment methods for water resources management in nordic regions under a changing climate and provided practical guidelines for the selection of bias adjustment methods given specific research targets and hydroclimatic regimes keywords climate change bias adjustment bias correction climate model hydrological signatures high latitudes data availability the cordex data used is available at http www cordex org 1 introduction streamflow regimes are considerably impacted by climate change due to simultaneous effects of rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns villarini and wasko 2021 higher temperatures cause increasing atmospheric water demand which in turn changes precipitation timing and amount cheng et al 2019 hanus et al 2021 ipcc 2014 at the same time higher temperatures affect the timing and duration of snow season gergel et al 2017 snowmelt hakala et al 2018 and resulting streamflow clow 2010 concurrent shifts in precipitation and temperature also influence the availability and access to water clifton et al 2018 as well as the timing and magnitude of extremes like floods or droughts dankers et al 2014 dankers and feyen 2009 villarini and wasko 2021 in nordic countries changes in hydroclimatic drivers of streamflow have already been observed through warming temperatures resulting in shorter ice cover durations hallerbäck et al 2021 and general wetting trends chen et al 2021a current future projections indicate an intensification of climate change in the northern hemisphere by the end of the century ipcc 2021 which would inevitably influence flow regimes in nordic regions teutschbein et al 2015 anticipated changes include e g a decrease in daily flows matti et al 2017 shorter snow seasons hallerbäck et al 2021 an earlier onset of spring floods with lower peaks slightly lower summer flows and higher winter base flows in snowmelt driven catchments teutschbein et al 2015 together these changes could lead to a higher frequency of rainfall driven floods in nordic catchments bergström et al 2001 matti et al 2016 and to a shift in the current flood regimes from spring summer to autumn winter arheimer and lindström 2015 vormoor et al 2015 in contrast rainfall driven catchments in southern regions of the nordic countries will likely experience streamflow reductions during most of the year except for winter due to increasing evapotranspiration rates and longer growing seasons teutschbein et al 2017 such shifts can severely limit the availability of water for ecosystems carpenter et al 1992 and adversely affect human livelihood by threatening water availability for agriculture and hydropower berghuijs et al 2014 to develop efficient mitigation and adaptation strategies water resource managers need reliable information generated by hydrological impact studies hydrological impact studies rely on a modeling chain to simulate future streamflow projections hakala et al 2019 wagener et al 2022 climate models cms provide global scale meteorological data representative for one or several greenhouse gas concentration pathways refsgaard et al 2014 the data can be further utilized as initial and boundary conditions for regional cms to obtain meteorological projects at finer spatial and temporal resolutions theoretically the outputs of the regional cms could be used as direct input to hydrological models to simulate climate impacts on the water cycle at the catchment scale hakala et al 2019 nevertheless due to parametrization and numerical limitations cms generally provide biased simulations with systematic errors compared to observations maraun 2016 teutschbein and seibert 2012 these biases can manifest in the amount timing and the dependence between the climate variables at hand françois et al 2020 hakala et al 2018 piani and haerter 2012 tootoonchi et al 2022a wilcke et al 2013 to reduce these biases different bias adjustment methods have been suggested these range from simple univariate bias adjustment ba methods such as delta change quantile mapping qm or the delta mapping method dm to more advanced multivariate ba methods such as copula and bias correction in multiple dimensions mbcn univariate ba methods adjust only one climate variable at the time e g in hakala et al 2018 teutschbein seibert 2012 in particular the qm methods such as distribution scaling ds and quantile delta mapping qdm are often preferred due to their simple implementation procedure and their arguably robust capabilities to adjust various aspects of cm simulations berg et al 2022 gudmundsson et al 2012 teutschbein and seibert 2012 tootoonchi et al 2022a multivariate methods however account for the interlinkages between climate variables and adjust both univariate and multivariate characteristics of these series e g in françois et al 2020 meyer et al 2019 räty et al 2018 mehrotra et al 2018 mehrotra and sharma 2021 which can be relevant for extreme and compound events meyer et al 2019 tootoonchi et al 2022a zscheischler et al 2019 but these methods can be more challenging to implement compared to univariate ones as they demand more computational resources and advanced statistical and programming skills of the user they may also adversely affect temporal characteristics of the climate variables for example they can distort autocorrelation in the series françois et al 2020 tootoonchi et al 2022a van de velde et al 2022 in a nordic context previous research showed that both multivariate methods copula and mbcn perform similarly to their univariate counterparts ds and qdm respectively in adjustment of biases in univariate characteristics of precipitation and temperature series in numerous swedish catchments tootoonchi et al 2022a however the multivariate ba methods outperformed their univariate counterparts in reproducing the positive dependence between precipitation and temperature during colder winter months the negative dependence during warm summer months and the clausius clapeyron relation correlations between precipitation and temperature varied across catchments i e latitudes and climates and seasons although both multivariate methods performed well in this regard they were inferior to the univariate methods in adjusting temporal characteristics such as cross correlation considering the advantages of multivariate methods in accounting for dependence between the adjusted variables their impact on the accuracy of simulated streamflows is not clear specifically the question if the use of advanced multivariate ba methods results in considerably more reliable streamflow projectionscompared to their univariate alternatives has remained opened on one hand it is well recognized that univariate behavior of climate variables such as mean and variance of temperature and precipitation should be well represented guo et al 2020 teutschbein and seibert 2012 tootoonchi et al 2022a to properly simulate future streamflows on the other hand other characteristics such as temporal behavior or the dependence between precipitation and temperature may also play a key role in the accuracy of streamflow simulations chen et al 2021a for instance dependence between precipitation and temperature influences water holding capacity of the atmosphere panthou et al 2014 which can affect both intensity and timing of extreme precipitation myhre et al 2019 evapotranspiration aghakouchak et al 2014 and snowmelt hakala et al 2018 as a result preserving the dependence between climatic variables could be critical to reliably project future water balance as well as the timing and severity of future floods or droughts guo et al 2020 meyer et al 2019 zehe and sivapalan 2009 to reliably simulate streamflow from simulated climate data hydrological models need to be calibrated pool et al 2017 model performance in the calibration and evaluation periods have traditionally been quantified in term of efficiency measures such as nash sutcliffe nash and sutcliffe 1970 or kling gupta coefficients gupta et al 2009 yilmaz et al 2010 while these measures are good indicators of the overall model performance they do not indicate the ability of a hydrological model to reproduce specific features of streamflow regimes i e hydrological signatures such as the timing or magnitude of seasonal high or low flows addor and fischer 2015 feng and beighley 2020 mendoza et al 2016 such signatures are however essential for flood hazard assessment and water resource management brunner et al 2021 todorović et al 2022 thus we argue that using a range of hydrological signatures kabuya et al 2020 mcmillan 2021 zhang et al 2018 is an essential to complement traditional efficiency measures and enable a process informed evaluation of ba methods while a number of studies evaluated the impact of univariate ba methods on simulated hydrological variables e g hakala et al 2018 muerth et al 2013 teutschbein seibert 2012 relatively few studies evaluated multivariate ba methods in this context for instance räty et al 2018 compared streamflow simulations after applications of two univariate and two multivariate ba methods in four european catchments but did not find any substantial improvement after application of multivariate ba methods in these catchments meyer et al 2019 however found that multivariate ba outperformed univariate ba when simulating water storage in snow and glaciers in two swiss alpine catchments a north american study found that multivariate ba methods improve accuracy of streamflow simulations more in catchments of arid and warm regions than in catchments in colder regions with a prolonged snow season guo et al 2020 it remains however unclear if these findings can be transferred to nordic catchments additionally research in this field has so far produced little guidance for impact modelers who are interested in one or several specific streamflow characteristics and who need to select a ba method that is both easily applicable and fit for a specific task at hand to bridge these gaps this study assessed the suitability of different ba methods for accurate reproduction of hydrological signatures relevant for water resources management in the nordic regions under climate change this assessment was based on the outputs of 10 cms in 50 swedish catchments which covered a large variety of climatic and hydrologic conditions climate variables in this multi catchment ensemble were adjusted with two parsimonious univariate and two advanced multivariate bias adjustment methods bias adjusted temperature and precipitation series were then used to force the hydrological hbv light model bergström 1976 lindström et al 1997 seibert and vis 2012 and to simulate streamflows in each catchment evaluation of the ba methods was based on a comprehensive set of hydrological signatures describing a the overall water balance and streamflow dynamics b seasonal streamflows c low and d high flow characteristics the evaluation was tailored to enable addressing the following research questions 1 performance and similarities of ba methods can the application of ba methods improve the accuracy in reproducing hydrological signatures in nordic catchments and are there any considerable differences among the ba methods or recurring similarities can be found 2 robustness of ba methods do more complex multivariate ba methods outperform parsimonious univariate ba methods by frequent improvements and consistent performance across a climate models b catchments and c hydroclimatic regimes 3 comparison based recommendations can we identify one or several ba method s that consistently outperform s the other methods in simulating hydrological signatures relevant for water resources management under changing climate in the nordic regions we synthetized all results to provide specific recommendations for the selection of ba methods depending on the hydrological signature of interest and put these recommendations in the context of effective water resources management under changing climate conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 study area sweden a country with a land area of roughly 408 000 km2 is heavily forested 69 of the land area with a large number of lakes wetlands and streams 9 roughly 8 of the land is covered by shrubs and grass land 8 are agricultural land 3 urban areas and 3 open land and glaciers sweden stretches over three köppen geiger beck et al 2018 climatic zones fig 1 a 1 the polar tundra climate zone et with monthly mean temperatures below 10 c covers the scandinavian mountains in north western sweden 2 the subarctic boreal climate dfc with cool summers and winters with persistent seasonal snow and soil frost covers central and northern sweden and 3 the warm summer hemiboreal climate zone dfb covers southern sweden in this study we used a set of 50 swedish catchments fig 1a spread latitudinally from 55 95 n to 68 37 n and longitudinally between 11 54 e to 22 31 e catchment areas spanned from 2 to 8425 km2 with average elevations between 12 and 942 m a s l selection of the catchments was primarily dictated by the availability of data i e only those catchments for which continuous daily temperature precipitation and streamflow observations were available for the period 1961 2004 were included additional selection criteria included a low percentage of lakes 37 glaciers and urbanized areas 3 1 and a low degree 30 2 of regulation i e reservoir volume relative to the mean annual flow volume from its draining area cf todorović et al 2022 the resulting 50 catchments were spatially distributed across all three climatic zones of sweden fig 1a and thus featured diverse hydroclimatic characteristics during the period 1961 2004 total annual precipitation over the chosen catchments ranged from 1500 mm year1 in north western sweden to 400 mm year 1 in southern sweden fig 1b while annual mean temperature varied from 3 0 c in the north to 7 7 c in the south fig 1c hydrological regimes also featured a north south gradient fig 1a right panel with snowmelt driven regimes in northern regions and rainfall driven regimes in southern regions arheimer and lindström 2015 matti et al 2017 2 2 data 2 2 1 observed variables precipitation temperature and streamflow gridded daily mean values of observed temperature and precipitation were obtained from the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi as spatially interpolated 4 km 4 km national grids for the period 1961 2020 johansson 2002 daily streamflow records were downloaded from a publicly accessible streamflow database https vattenwebb smhi se hosted by smhi while geospatial data of the catchment boundaries for each of the 50 catchments were obtained from smhi s svar database eklund 2011 2 2 2 climate data to cover a wide range of uncertainty we used outputs from different combinations of global and regional climate models cms for the historic period of 1961 2004 table 1 acquired from the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 together with coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex initiative jacob et al 2014 we selected only those cms that had both historic and future precipitation and temperature simulations available until the end of the century 2100 for three greenhouse gas concentration trajectories i e rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 and for the highest available resolution 0 11 roughly 12 5 km this selection protocol left us with 10 rcm gcm combinations if simulations were available in several versions e g v1 and v2 we opted for the most recent version i e v2 gridded daily precipitation and temperature data were spatially averaged over each catchment from values in all grid cells partly covering the catchment of interest 2 3 bias adjustment of climate models we selected four different ba methods two commonly used univariate methods and two more recently developed multivariate methods the selected methods either rely on a theoretical probably distribution hereafter referred to as distribution based methods or follow a distribution free approach while other univariate methods e g linear scaling lenderink et al 2007 or variance scaling chen et al 2011 as well as alternative multivariate methods e g dynamical optimal transport correction robin et al 2019 exist the four selected methods represent the most frequently utilized to date note that multivariate methods can additionally be categorized according to their conceptual features i e if they show stochastic or deterministic behavior or the order in which the dependence is adjusted françois et al 2020 each ba method was calibrated to adjust cm simulations to precipitation and temperature observed over 22 years between 1961 and 1982 precipitation and temperature data recorded in the subsequent 22 years evaluation period 1983 2004 were adjusted directly based on the parameters estimated during the calibration period this set up was selected both due to data availability i e historic simulations of cmip5 cm outputs span until 2005 and due to the requirements of equally long time series for forming the empirical copula for each period ba was performed on a monthly basis to preserve seasonal variations in accordance with the common practice drizzle days with 1 mm day 1 of precipitation were set to dry days i e days with zero precipitation before the evaluation of the ba methods teutschbein and seibert 2012 tootoonchi et al 2022a 2 3 1 univariate methods quantile mapping qm is a category of univariate ba methods that adjusts the entire probability distributions of cm outputs to match the corresponding distribution of observations chen et al 2013 gudmundsson et al 2012 qm methods have been shown to be superior to other univariate methods such as linear scaling or variance scaling teutschbein and seibert 2012 and are thus considered the benchmark to compare multivariate methods with we adopted two versions of qm 1 the distribution based method called distribution scaling ds and 2 the distribution free method called quantile delta mapping qdm distribution scaling ds implies the selection of particular theoretical distribution families to form cumulative distribution functions cdfs of variables typically a gamma distribution with the shape parameter α and the scale parameter β is used to represent precipitation intensity on wet days thom 1951 while a gaussian distribution with mean µ and variance σ is often applied to temperature of the entire record in line with the previous studies e g gudmundsson et al 2012 teutschbein seibert 2012 yang et al 2010 our preliminary analysis confirmed the suitability of these two distribution families to represent cm outputs and hence we used them in this paper in contrast to ds the distribution free quantile delta mapping qdm approach explicitly preserves relative changes in simulated cm outputs li et al 2010 and at the same time adjusts biases in quantiles of the simulated variables by taking into account observations in the calibration period cannon et al 2015 olsson et al 2009 willems and vrac 2011 this method is thus beneficial if there is enough confidence in the plausibility of the change signal simulated by the cm cannon 2018 maraun 2016 a visual representation of qdm approach in comparison to other quantile mapping methods can be found in the paper by berg et al 2022 2 3 2 multivariate methods in contrast to univariate ba methods multivariate methods additionally adjust the dependence between variables along with their univariate features piani and haerter 2012 two frequently used multivariate methods in impact studies include distribution based copula and distribution free multivariate bias correction in n dimensions methods mbcn in copula adjustment methods the joint rank dependence of two or more variables is represented by a mathematical function which couples their marginal distributions for two continuous random set of variables x and y the copula can be represented as sklar 1959 1 h x y c f x g y where h x y features the cumulative distribution function cdf of the bivariate distribution of x and y f x and g y are their respective univariate marginal cdfs and c the copula function that joins two marginal cdfs together for a comprehensive introduction to the general concept and mathematical basis of copulas the reader is referred to seminal papers by genest favre 2007 and nelsen 2006 for adjusting biases in cm simulations copulas were either used by fitting theoretical copula families to the series li et al 2014 räty et al 2018 or in empirical form bárdossy and pegram 2012 piani and haerter 2012 vrac 2018 here we tested four theoretical copula families consisting of three archimedean copulas frank clayton and gumbel and one elliptical copula gaussian to apply the copulas the formal procedure by tootoonchi et al 2022b was adopted in this study first the data was pre processed and screened for non stationarity trends and ties ties are data with the same rank such as days with zero precipitation dry days as daily data featured numerous dry days a jittering algorithm similar to the one proposed by pappadà et al 2017 was applied to the precipitation series to break the ties in this approach adjustment of precipitation is performed by replacement of zero precipitation values i e dry days with extremely small random but nonzero values vrac et al 2016 thereafter theoretical copula families were fitted to the observed data to ensure the suitability of the selected theoretical copula families the cramér von mises goodness of fit test was applied genest et al 2009 when the test failed to provide an admissible copula i e the test yielded p value 0 05 following e g brunner et al 2019b genest et al 2009 genest and remillard 2008 empirical copulas were used instead using the fitted copula parameters a new copula was computed for the cm simulated precipitation and temperature creating adjusted dependence characteristics thereafter the ds method was applied on the margins i e precipitation and temperature to adapt the univariate characteristics of these series for more detailed explanation of the copula approach the reader is referred to other papers e g genest and favre 2007 tootoonchi et al 2022b recently cannon 2018 introduced mbcn to the bias adjustment community which is available as a free r package https rdrr io cran mbc man mbcn html since its publication mbcn has been adopted as the benchmark for testing multivariate methods in numerous studies e g de velde et al 2022 françois et al 2020 meyer et al 2019 singh reza najafi 2020 in this method randomly generated orthogonal matrices are repeatedly applied on the variables rotating them in space at each rotation a selected univariate method e g qdm is applied on each of variables separately to adjust biases in their univariate features this iterative process is continued until the variables feature multivariate similarity according to the following energy distance metric

each of the 50 catchments with the standard version of the hbv light model seibert and vis 2012 which has been widely adopted in many regions seibert and bergström 2022 the model consists of 1 snow 2 soil moisture 3 response and 4 routing routines seibert and vis 2012 in this study we used the spatially lumped standard version of the hbv light model the model required daily precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration as inputs series of daily potential evapotranspiration were computed from the temperature series observed and simulated by the cms raw and bias adjusted by applying the hamon method hamon 1961 2 4 2 calibration and evaluation of hbv light following a one year warm up period from 1961 to 1962 hbv light was calibrated in each catchment against 21 years of daily streamflow observations from 1963 to 1982 the calibration was performed in each catchment separately by using the built in gap optimization algorithm seibert 2000 the gap optimization was run 5000 times after randomly drawing 50 initial parameter sets the model calibration was performed by maximizing a composite objective function fobj which was selected to achieve a balanced model performance in high and low flows and in reproducing streamflow volume 3 f obj 0 75 n s e 0 2 log n s e 0 05 v e where nse denotes the high flow sensitive nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe

ve denotes volumetric efficiency criss and winston 2008 values of the three components of the objective function in the calibration and evaluation periods fig 2 suggested a good model performance and therefore provide a solid ground for assessing the performance of the selected ba methods in reproducing hydrological signatures 2 4 3 streamflow simulations the calibrated hbv light model was then used to simulate daily streamflow in each of the 50 catchments for the period 1963 2004 with three different sets of input 1 observed precipitation and temperature the reference simulations 2 raw precipitation and temperature simulated by the 10 cms and 3 bias adjusted precipitation and temperature simulated by the 10 cms and the four ba methods to reduce the effect of model uncertainty on the evaluation of ba methods a set of 16 hydrological signatures table 2 see section 2 4 3 obtained from streamflows simulated with the observed precipitation and temperature was used as reference hydrological signatures obtained from streamflows simulated with raw or bias adjusted cm precipitation and temperature i e inputs 2 and 3 were thus evaluated against this reference rather than against signatures of streamflow observations this evaluation protocol eliminates the uncertainties caused by hydrological model structure and or parameter estimates and is in line with the recommendations by hakala et al 2019 for the assessment of uncertainty stemming from the ba methods 2 5 hydrological signatures the 16 signatures were selected to capture complementary characteristics of streamflow regimes which relate to a water balance and flow dynamics b seasonal flows c low flows and d high flows table 2 considering that the selected signatures generally reflect annual streamflow behavior e g spring flows mean annual flows or timing of the spring pulse day they were firstly computed from daily streamflows separately for each year and then averaged over the entire period between 1963 and 2004 such protocol which is adopted in many hydroclimatic studies suggests evaluate of ba methods performance over long periods françois et al 2020 maraun and widmann 2018 focusing on the entire 42 year period was recognized as the most robust split sample strategy maraun and widmann 2018 shen et al 2022 and as such was also applied in numerous previous studies e g meyer et al 2019 zscheischler et al 2019 2 6 evaluation framework for the comparison of bias correction methods we compared the performance of four ba methods section 2 3 in reproducing 16 hydrological signatures section 2 5 obtained from simulated streamflows with the outputs of 10 different cms section 2 2 2 and observed climate series in the 50 swedish catchments section 2 1 the evaluation was based on absolute errors mae computed as follows 4 mae 1 n i 1 n r i r ref where r i denotes a signature computed from the outputs of the hbv light model forced with the raw and four bias adjusted outputs of the climate modelling chains separately conversely r r e f denotes a signature obtained with the reference model i e model forced with observed precipitation and temperature we then addressed the research questions in a framework consisting of 1 performance 2 robustness and 3 a comparison based evaluation of ba methods which guided the practical recommendations in the final section of this paper the performance of ba methods was visually analyzed with the help of separate heatmaps for raw and the four bias adjusted cm outputs which allowed an evaluation of emerging patterns across catchments and cms the pearson correlation coefficient pearson 1920 based on 500 pairs of values 50 catchments 10 cms for each possible combination of the 5 cm simulations 1 raw and 4 ba methods for each of the 16 hydrological signatures table 2 was then used to detect similarities in the performance of the applied ba methods across catchments and cms in this study we considered ba method pairs with correlation coefficients higher than 0 7 similar the overall robustness of ba methods was evaluated based on the concepts of accuracy and precision that have often been applied to measurements mcmillan et al 2018 or model predictions wagener et al 2022 and are here applied to the bias adjusted model simulations accuracy here refers to the ability of a bias adjusted model to yield simulations close to the observations i e have a low bias and it was quantified by averaging maes across the 50 catchments and 10 cms 500 instances and also by the frequency of improvements i e how many times a ba method reduced the raw bias precision refers to the low variability of bias adjusted simulations provided by multiple cms i e have a low variance thus the variance across cms and across catchments was computed under the assumption that robust ba methods perform consistently well i e have a low variability regardless of the climate models used or catchment properties to further check the consistency across hydroclimatic regimes the robustness was analyzed separately for the snowmelt driven regimes in northern regions i e within et and dfb climate zones and for rainfall driven regimes in southern regions i e dfc climate zone the differences in runoff regimes between these two groups of catchments are clearly shown in fig 1a the snowmelt driven catchments were characterized by a pronounced runoff seasonality with the highest runoff in spring and early summer as opposed to rainfall dominated catchments that exhibited rather subtle runoff variation throughout the year the final comparison based evaluation was based on the following eight criteria which described each ba method s ability to strongly reduce biases i e to yield low mae values criterion 1 frequently reduce biases i e to have a high frequency of improvement criterion 2 robustly reduce biases across various cms that had different boundary conditions and process representations i e to yield a low variance in mae values across cms criterion 3 robustly reduce biases across a multitude of catchments with various catchment characteristics and hydroclimatic properties i e to yield a low variance in mae values across catchments criterion 4 strongly reduce biases across hydroclimatic regimes dominated by snowfall and melt i e to have low mae values in northern catchments criterion 5 frequently reduce biases across hydroclimatic regimes dominated by snowfall and melt i e to have a high frequency of improvements in the northern catchments criterion 6 strongly reduce biases across hydroclimatic regimes dominated by rainfall i e to have low mae values in southern catchments criterion 7 frequently reduce biases across hydroclimatic regimes dominated by rainfall i e to have a high frequency of improvements in the southern catchments criterion 8 for each of these criteria the performance of every ba method was categorized as high 75 of max min range medium 75 and greater than 25 or low 25 to reveal if particular ba methods consistently outperformed the remaining ones in simulating signatures relevant for water resources management under changing climate 3 results 3 1 performance of ba methods 3 1 1 performance across the signature groups 3 1 1 1 water balance and runoff dynamics signatures runoff signatures simulated with raw cms typically featured considerable biases expressed as mae for annual mean flow q mean raw biases were as high as 2 mm day 1 fig 3 a left panel nearly three times the reference value i e mean flow simulated with the observed meteorological input the runoff coefficient q coeff demonstrated substantial biases of up to 0 3 fig 3b signatures characterizing streamflow dynamics also showed considerable biases in raw simulations the center of mass comt was biased up to 35 days or roughly one month fig 3c and biases in the timing of the spring flood spd reached up to 200 days i e more than 6 months fig 3d considerably stronger biases in spd were detected in southern catchments with latitudes below 60 n fig 3d all ba methods were able to reduce the initial biases in these signatures obtained from raw cm outputs fig 3a d main differences were visible between the two groups of distribution based ds and copula and distribution free methods qdm and mbcn while the differences between uni ds and qdm and multivariate methods copula an mbcn were less pronounced biases in raw q mean were reduced from 2 mm day 1 down to a maximum of 0 2 mm day 1 with distribution based methods ds and copula and down to a maximum of 0 4 mm day 1 with distribution free approaches i e qdm and mbcn fig 3a biases in raw q coeff were considerably reduced after application of all the methods fig 3b the distribution based methods reduced maes to maximum of 0 03 and distribution free methods up to 0 06 fig 3b for comt all four ba methods performed similarly resulting in biases between 13 days with ds and 16 days with copula fig 3c biases in spd after applying the distribution based methods were noticeably lower approximately up to 70 days than after applying the distribution free methods that resulted in biases up to approximately 120 days fig 3d within both groups of distribution based and distribution free methods similar patterns emerged in the remaining biases in all signatures of the group fig 3 the exception in this regard was spd fig 3d for which the patterns obtained with copula diverged from those of the remaining methods generally patterns obtained with all ba methods differed from those obtained with the raw cm outputs in all cases with exception of spd which was characterized by pronounced change with the latitude in contrast to the variation across latitudes i e catchments the variation in biases across cms generally did not exhibit any apparent pattern i e no cm consistently resulted in lower biases across all signatures of the group obtained and with all ba methods 3 1 1 2 seasonal flows signatures seasonal flows obtained with uncorrected cm outputs featured biases of up to 2 3 mm day 1 in q spring fig 4 a and up to 6 mm day 1 in q summer fig 4b the maes were however lower for the other two seasons only reaching as high as 1 6 mm day 1 for q autumn fig 4c and 1 1 mm day 1 for q winter fig 4d in all four cases raw biases were substantial and at least twice the reference values in case of q autumn even 7 times biases in seasonal flows also featured a distinct spatial pattern with much higher mae values in the north in the spring and summer fig 4a b whereas the opposite behavior was observed in the winter fig 4d the distribution free methods qdm and mbcn reduced biases in q spring fig 4a to a maximum of 0 7 mm day 1 while the distribution based methods resulted in biases of up to 0 55 mm day 1 and 0 35 mm day 1 with ds and copula respectively fig 4a for q summer fig 4b univariate ba methods resulted in maes of up to 1 8 mm day 1 while simulations based on the multivariate ba methods featured smaller errors up to 1 3 mm day 1 distribution based methods performed similarly for q autumn maximum mae of 0 83 mm day 1 fig 4c and generally better than distribution free approaches which performed similarly taking values up to 1 3 mm day 1 through simulations with all four methods bias ranges in q winter fig 4d were somewhat similar and took values of up to 0 45 mm day 1 with distribution based methods and up to 0 55 mm day 1 with the distribution free ones in all signatures of this group fig 4a d the two distribution free methods exhibited similar mae patterns furthermore similarities in the mae patterns could also be observed in the univariate methods ds and qdm for q summer fig 4b and q winter fig 4d the copula method resulted in a completely different mae pattern in q winter fig 4d particularly in the southern catchments additionally q summer and q winter exhibited a distinct spatial pattern i e maes in q summer were notably higher in the northern catchments while q winter showed the opposite pattern the patterns obtained with the raw cm outputs were generally altered by applying the ba methods although a slight resemblance in mae patterns could be detected for the summer and winter flows visual inspection of the panels with the signatures obtained with bias adjusted climate variables did not identify any cm that consistently yielded lower biases across the ba methods and signatures 3 1 1 3 low flows signatures biases in the low flow frequency lffreq fig 5 a and timing of low flows t minq30 fig 5b were generally high up to 100 days for simulations with uncorrected cm outputs the other two signatures representing the magnitude of low flows featured biases as high as 0 22 mm day 1 in minq d7 fig 5c and up to 0 25 mm day 1 in minq d30 fig 5d both of which exceeded the reference values by more than three times biases in all low flow signatures with bias adjusted cm simulations were considerably cut down the mae values in lffreq fig 5a were similar across all four ba methods ranging between 40 days after applying the distribution based methods and 45 days after the application of the distribution free methods the distribution based methods resulted in lower ranges of maes in t minq30 up to 40 days with ds and up to 55 days with copula fig 5b compared to distribution free methods which showed errors of up to 80 days after applying qdm and up to 100 days after applying mbcn for minq d7 fig 5c and minq d30 fig 5d ds qdm and mbcn reduced the original raw biases to a similar extent resulting in mae values of up to 0 16 mm day 1 and 0 18 mm day 1 respectively however the application of the copula method resulted in considerably lower biases of only up to 0 8 mm day 1 in minq d7 fig 5c and of 0 1 mm day 1 in minq d30 fig 5d while similarities in the mae patterns could be observed between distribution free methods fig 5a d the copula approach again stood out by featuring considerably different patterns in t minq30 fig 5b maes in none of the signatures obtained with bias adjusted cm outputs exhibited any apparent pattern across cms or latitudes except for copula for t minq30 that yielded slightly higher maes in the south such behavior was consistent with the signatures obtained with raw outputs which did not display any distinct north south pattern nevertheless close similarities between the patterns obtained from raw and adjusted cm outputs could not be detected in these signatures 3 1 1 4 high flows signatures high flow signatures based on the uncorrected cm outputs featured considerable biases fig 6 a d biases in the frequency related signature hffreq fig 6a and timing related signature t maxq1 fig 6b were up to 100 days particularly in southern catchments in the latter maes in maxq d30 fig 6c and maxq d1 fig 6d featured higher maes in the northern catchments of up to 8 mm day 1 respective 12 mm day 1 both of which amounted to over two times the references values after bias adjustment biases in hffreq fig 6a were considerably reduced with all four methods taking values of up to 20 days with the distribution based methods ds and copula and up to 35 days for the distribution free methods qdm and mbcn a noteworthy pattern emerged while all four ba methods were able to considerably reduce biases in t maxq1 in the northern catchments the distribution based methods struggled in the southern catchments and basically did not result in a distinct reduction of maes fig 6b on the contrary after the application of ds several catchments featured biases in t maxq1 as large as 100 days which exceeded the original raw biases this problem was even more pronounced for the copula method which to a large extent inflated the raw biases in the southern catchments fig 6b for maxq d30 fig 6c all methods performed similarly with copula featuring the lowest biases up to 2 mm day 1 and qdm the highest biases up to 3 5 mm day 1 biases in maxq d1 fig 6d featured similar ranges for ds copula and mbcn up to 5 5 mm day 1 while maes with qdm were somewhat larger exhibiting values of up to 8 mm day 1 fig 6d for all high flow signatures similarities could be observed in patterns obtained with the distribution free methods qdm and mbcn note that the patterns in maes after applying the copula approach were again somewhat different from the other methods fig 6a d most evidently we could observe horizontal lines in fig 6a d which indicated rather low variation across the cms the mae values in hffreq fig 6a did not feature a distinct north south gradient however spatial variations across latitudes were apparent in the other three high flow signatures for example biases in t maxq1 fig 6b were mostly higher in the southern catchments while the opposite behavior was exhibited by maxq d30 and maxq d1 as for the latter larger biases in the northern catchments were also obtained with the raw cm outputs no cms could be identified as the most robust in the ensemble since no cm consistently yielded the lowest residual biases 4 similarity of ba patterns similarities between the patterns in the signatures were detected in many instances as outlined in section 3 1 1 first we analyzed to what degree ba methods maintained the patterns obtained with raw cm data i e correlations between raw and each of the ba methods thereafter we examined the correlations between all pairwise combinations of the four ba methods we considered the pearson correlation coefficients greater than 0 70 to be an indication of a strong correlation overall correlations between the signatures obtained from adjusted cm outputs and those obtained with raw ones were weak as indicated by rather low values of the pearson correlation coefficients signatures that had the lowest correlations to mae obtained from raw simulations included comt fig 7 a third panel t minq30 fig 7c second panel and hffreq fig 7d first panel with the copula method showing the lowest correlation with uncorrected cms in these signatures the highest correlation coefficients between maes in raw and the bias adjusted values were detected in q mean q summer maxq d30 and maxq d1 in all cases except for q mean the multivariate methods copula and mbcn featured stronger correlations with raw cm than the univariate ones ds and qdm as opposed to correlations to the signatures obtained from raw cm outputs some rather strong correlations between signatures obtained with ba methods could be detected more specifically strong correlations were detected in three pairs of ba methods 1 most frequently between distribution free methods qdm and mbcn for all 16 signatures 2 between distribution based methods ds and copula for seven signatures and 3 between the univariate methods ds and qdm for four signatures the correlation between the two multivariate methods was generally lower than for the other couples i e in the range 0 03 0 63 4 1 robustness of ba methods 4 1 1 overall robustness all ba methods were able to consistently reduce the initial raw biases which was demonstrated by considerably smaller mae values averaged over all 50 catchments and 10 cms compared to the simulations based on raw cm data indicated by smaller circles in fig 8 biases in the signatures related to water balance and flow dynamics fig 8a as well as in the seasonal flows fig 8b were generally reduced i e the application of the ba methods resulted in average bias reductions of more than 50 of the initial bias biases in signatures related to low fig 8c and high flows fig 8d were reduced less well which was particularly pronounced in e g timings of 30 day low flows t minq30 fig 8c and of the annual maximum flows t maxq1 fig 8d to examine whether the ba methods reduced the biases not just in a few instances but rather consistently across all 500 simulations 50 catchments 10 cms we also analyzed the frequency of improvements these results generally corroborated the mae values water balance and flow dynamics signatures fig 8a as well as seasonal flows fig 8b had somewhat higher rates of bias reductions on average improvements in 81 and 78 of simulations respectively compared to the other signatures application of the ba methods led to improvements in 74 of the simulated low flow signatures fig 8c and 75 of high flow signatures fig 8d the lowest frequency of improvements was found in t minq30 and t maxq1 both 57 while the highest frequency was achieved in summer flows q summer 93 fig 8b and in the runoff coefficients q coeff 92 fig 8a in most cases the best results were obtained with the distribution based methods ds and copula which resulted in lower mae values than their distribution free counterparts but also a higher frequency of improvements the only two signatures for which the opposite pattern was obtained were t minq30 and t maxq1 it is also noteworthy that uni and multivariate methods within the same group of either distribution based or distribution free ba approaches generally resulted in rather similar values of averaged mae and frequency of improvements especially in the signatures related to water balance and flow dynamics fig 8a and the seasonal flows fig 8b the only exception in this regard was the copula method which struggled to adjust biases in t minq30 fig 8c and even inflated existing biases in t maxq1 fig 8d 4 1 2 consistency across climate models the application of ba methods led to noticeably reduced mae values compared to raw across all climate models for all 16 signatures with exception of copula and t maxq1 as elaborated in detail in the previous section the reduction in biases is apparent not only in the median values but also in the interquartile ranges of mae values across the 10 cms which were consistently smaller than those of the raw simulations fig 9 distribution free methods generally showed higher variability of the errors i e larger inconsistency than distribution based methods fig 9 depicted by the circles on top of each boxplot representing the variance with mbcn demonstrating the highest variance across cms for half of the signatures and never featuring the lowest variance this was closely followed by qdm which featured the highest variance in five signatures and the lowest in one in contrast copula stood out by resulting in the lowest variance across cm i e the highest consistency for 14 of the 16 signatures closely followed by ds fig 9 the largest variances i e inconsistencies were found in the low flow signatures fig 9c for which the minimum maximum ranges across the cms were relatively large and in particular for minq d7 and minq d30 although these ranges were not excessive in the absolute terms i e they took values up to 0 05 mm day 1 they were nearly as large as for the raw simulations especially with the qdm method 4 1 3 consistency across catchments the performance of ba methods was generally more variable across catchments compared to their variance across cms which was reflected by a wider interquartile range and a larger variance fig 10 however the application of the ba methods still led to a visible reductions in the median mae for all signatures and in lower variability of mae values across catchments which was consistently smaller than raw values for the majority of signatures the distribution based methods ds and copula featured generally a higher variability i e larger inconsistencies with copula having the largest variance in nine of the 16 signatures and ds in four cases distribution free methods were mostly associated with lower variance of maes with qdm featuring only once and mbcn only twice the highest variance among the ba methods however differences across the ba methods in variances across catchments were less pronounced than in variances across cms variance across catchments was generally a little smaller for signatures representing the water balance and runoff dynamics fig 10a and seasonal streamflows fig 10b than for the signatures representing low fig 10c and high flows fig 10d inconsistencies were particularly large in t minq30 for which the raw variance was even inflated by the copula and mbcn methods fig 10c second panel and in t maxq1 for which all methods except mbcn inflated the variance fig 10d second panel 4 1 4 consistency across hydroclimatic regimes given the variability in biases across catchments fig 11 we further assessed whether systematic differences in performance of ba methods in the northern catchments with dominantly snowmelt driven streamflow regimes located above latitude 60 n and southern primarily rainfall driven catchments located below 60 n could be detected in the northern catchments fig 11a d initial raw biases were consistently reduced with all ba methods in all 16 signatures notable were the high remaining biases and relatively low frequency of improvements for q winter fig 11b particularly with the univariate methods in contrast q summer fig 11b and t maxq1 fig 11d only had small biases remaining and featured a high rate of improvements in signatures representing the water balance and runoff dynamics fig 11a in the northern catchments distribution based methods resulted in slightly lower maes than distribution free methods the same behavior was detected for q spring and q autumn fig 11b for q summer however univariate methods outperformed the multivariate ones as opposed to q winter similarly both multivariate ba methods reduced biases in low flow signatures more than the univariate ones fig 11c except for t minq30 for which copula performed worse than the other three methods biases in high flow signatures were reduced most by the distribution based methods with the exception of maxq d1 for which copula resulted in the largest remaining bias fig 11d frequencies of improvement with the ba methods were largely consistent with the mae values i e lower remaining biases were accompanied with the highest rate of improvements the ba methods were generally able to reduce biases in the southern mainly rainfall driven catchments fig 11e h in most cases the distribution based ba methods outperformed distribution free ones both distribution based methods performed similarly i e ds and copula each performed best for half of the signatures on the other hand in the distribution free methods qdm outperformed mbcn in the majority of signatures 14 out of 16 for comt fig 11e t minq30 fig 11g and t maxq1 fig 11 h however the opposite pattern emerged i e the distribution free methods resulted in lower maes and a higher frequency of improvements compared to distribution based ones especially copula especially the copula method showed a low performance with remaining biases nearly as high as raw biases in comt or even higher in t minq30 and t maxq1 similarly to the northern catchments frequencies of improvement with the ba methods were consistent with the reduction in biases in other words a higher frequency of improvement was typically connected to lower maes 4 2 a comparison based evaluation based on the eight robustness criteria section 2 6 assessed in the previous sections we here fig 12 provide a comprehensive comparison of the ba methods aimed at identifying the most suitable method s for assessment of climate change impact on streamflow regime features represented by 16 signatures while application of each of the ba methods led to considerable improvements their overall performance varied for each criterion across signatures for example distribution based ba methods were generally more robust than the distribution free methods for signatures related to water balance and flow dynamics fig 12a as well as for seasonal flows fig 12b in both groups of signatures univariate ds frequently displayed a high performance across the criteria in 20 21 out of 32 cases and resulted in only 5 cases of low performance fig 12a b first panel closely followed by the multivariate copula approach with 18 20 high performance cases and 8 9 low performance cases fig 12a b third panel the multivariate variant of distribution free methods mbcn however performed worse than its univariate counterpart qdm with mbcn showing a low performance in 23 fig 12a fourth panel respective 22 fig 12b fourth panel cases whereas qdm ranked low only for 9 fig 12a third panel and 14 fig 12b third panel instances respectively remarkable was the robust performance of distribution based methods in reproducing signatures related to low flows fig 12c and high flows fig 12d these methods resulted in many more instances of high performance 14 each for ds and 18 21 for copula than the distribution free methods 9 12 cases for mbcn and 7 8 for qdm in the case of low flows fig 12c multivariate ba methods performed slightly better than their univariate counterparts i e copula performed better than ds and mbcn better than qdm for the signatures representing high flows fig 12d the application of multivariate methods resulted in a larger number of high performing instances compared to their univariate counterpart however the number of low performing cases also increased leaving fewer chances for medium performance across these methods the two multivariate methods namely copula fig 12d third panel and mbcn fig 12d fourth panel had only 2 and 5 medium performing cases while ds fig 12d first panel and qdm fig 12d second panel had as many as 11 and 15 of such cases respectively averaging the performance over the signatures within each signature group fig 12e revealed that the distribution based methods yielded similar performances that were better than those of the distribution free methods as indicated by their lower maes criterion 1 and higher frequencies of improvements criterion 2 while the distribution based methods also showed higher consistency across cms criterion 3 they came with slightly lower consistency across catchments criterion 4 generally there were slight differences between univariate and multivariate methods which were often overshadowed by the strong differences between distribution free and distribution based methods noticeable differences between uni and multivariate methods only emerged for the snowmelt driven catchments located above 60 n where advanced multivariate methods resulted in frequently better performance compared to their univariate counterparts criteria 5 6 nonetheless distribution based methods resulted in better performance compared to distribution free methods in the rainfall driven catchments located below 60 n the differences were again rather found between distribution based and distribution free methods criteria 7 8 where the former performed similar to each other and better than the latter with low performance of the advanced mbcn method across all four categories of signatures 5 discussion 5 1 performance and similarity of ba methods our results indicated that in the studied swedish catchments the hbv light model driven by uncorrected cm outputs i e precipitation and temperature resulted in substantial biases in all hydrological signatures representing 1 water balance and flow dynamics 2 seasonal flows 3 low flows and 4 high flows the magnitude of these biases varied across signatures cms catchments and their hydroclimatic regimes it is difficult to isolate signatures with the largest biases since they all have different units they take values that differ in orders of magnitude e g signatures related to timings can take value up to 366 as opposed to runoff coefficient which is 1 which also hinders comparisons across the signatures nevertheless all signatures obtained with raw cm outputs have in common great raw biases that can exceed the reference values by several times which brings informativeness and potential applicability of such signatures into question variations in biases across the cms did not exhibit any distinct behavior i e no cm consistently resulted in the highest lowest biases across signatures but certain patterns across catchments i e their hydroclimatic regions could be detected for example seven signatures related to seasonal and extreme flows showed clear spatial patterns among them were the 1 day and 30 day high flows as well as spring and summer flows which demonstrated higher systematic errors in northern snowfall dominated catchments located above 60 n in the et or dfb climate zones winter flows timing of 1 day high flow and spring pulse day featured the opposite pattern by having larger biases in the southern catchments below latitude 60 n in the dfc climate zone this behavior can be a consequence of different dominating hydrological regimes specifically regimes in northern sweden are generally snowmelt driven resulting in a pronounced flow seasonality with low flows during winters due to snow accumulation and a flood peak that typically occurs over springs and summers arheimer and lindström 2015 matti et al 2017 teutschbein et al 2022 teutschbein et al 2015 there are thus higher absolute flows in the north over spring and summer which consequently result in larger biases expressed in absolute terms in this study in contrast flows in southern sweden are generally rainfall driven matti et al 2017 and are affected by higher evaporative demands in the summer as a consequence there are generally lower flows in the summer and higher flows in winter in this region implying also higher biases in absolute terms in winter flows as demonstrated by our results section 3 1 1 2 larger biases in timings of annual maxima in these catchments can be attributed to spatiotemporal variability of extreme precipitation barlow et al 2019 that affects the timing of rainfall driven flow peaks which also results in less pronounced flow seasonality i e flatter intra annual flow distribution than in the northern catchments with snowmelt driven regimes biases in the other nine signatures did not show distinct spatial patterns generally the detected biases in hydrological signatures obtained with the raw cm outputs can be attributed to simplified representations of e g atmospheric convection lucas picher et al 2021 aerosol behavior huang and ding 2021 or humidity bastin et al 2019 in cms which are then translated into simulated streamflows through the impact modelling chain brunner and slater 2022 chen et al 2021b dobler et al 2012 teutschbein and seibert 2012 biases in simulated streamflows or hydrolgic signatures stemming from these simplifications cannot be expected to get alleviated with the application of the latest generation of cms i e cmip6 since there is no evidence for their superiority in representing different characteristics of climatic variables over the previous cm versions bourdeau goulet and hassanzadeh 2021 seneviratne and hauser 2020 application of bias adjustment methods has been debated over the past decade e g chen et al 2021b ehret et al 2012 some studies indicated that ba methods can potentially impair spatiotemporal characteristics of the cm outputs ehret et al 2012 whereas some studies clearly demonstrated their merits in minimizing overall uncertainty associated with hydrological simulations muerth et al 2013 teutschbein and seibert 2013 velázquez et al 2013 including even field scale agricultural impact studies glotter et al 2014 laux et al 2021 this paper corroborates conclusions presented in both groups of studies and specifically shows that application of ba methods can considerably modify simulated signals by raw cms our results also demonstrated that the application of ba methods in the vast majority of cases substantially decreases biases in the simulated hydrological signatures in the scandinavian catchments regardless of their hydroclimatic or geomorphological characteristics considering that cm induced biases can adversely affect results of the hydrological impact studies and hence hinder identification of adequate climate change adaptation strategies the results of our study support common practice which implies bias adjustment of simulated climate variables to be an integral part of impact studies dobler et al 2012 hakala et al 2019 teutschbein and seibert 2012 the four ba methods used in this study can be either categorized by the number of variables simultaneously being adjusted i e uni versus multivariate or by their underlying approach to map the distributions quantiles i e distribution free versus distribution based ds and copula both rely on the distribution based ds method for adjustment of univariate marginal biases in precipitation and temperature while qdm and mbcn share the distribution free qdm method for adjustment of univariate characteristics therefore by construction the performance of each pair of methods was similar in reducing biases in univariate characteristics of precipitation and temperature which are drivers of hydrological modeling tootoonchi et al 2022a our study revealed strong correlations in the remaining biases in simulated hydrological signatures obtained with the ba methods the strongest and most frequent correlations in this study were obtained between qdm and mbcn this demonstrates that the additional adjustment of the quite weak precipitation temperature dependence which is conducted with mbcn does not affect the similarities between these two distribution free methods since mbcn does not rely on heavy stationarity assumptions for dependence or temporal sequencing of climate models cannon 2016 such strong correlations between qdm and mbcn could be explained by the fact that the distribution free methods do not require identification of appropriate distribution functions at any step as opposed to the ds and copula methods that exhibited strong correlations less frequently this can be seen as a great flexibility in selecting a distribution free ba method which is relevant for future impact studies berg et al 2022 gudmundsson et al 2012 strong correlations were also found between the residual biases of ds and copula in many signatures the largest discrepancies between these two ba methods emerged in seasonal streamflows these results can indicate that seasonality of simulated streamflows is affected by accuracy in bias adjustment of precipitation temperature dependence which is a multivariate feature that is better adjusted with copula than with univariate ds tootoonchi et al 2022a correlations of residual biases obtained with distribution based and distribution free ba methods to raw biases were largely similar but low however the weakest correlations in this regard were obtained with the copula method e g winter flows or timing of annual minima section 3 1 1 the copula method includes a shuffling algorithm vrac 2018 that is typically stationary and based on the reference precipitation signal françois et al 2020 thus the original signal of the raw cm simulations is completely lost for precipitation and temperature which further reflects on simulated streamflow and hydrological signatures this might also explain some of the differences between ds and the copula approach to overcome this issue vrac thao 2020 recently introduced a flexible shuffling algorithm that takes different shuffling options into consideration they however also highlighted that in the context of impact studies further evaluations are needed to find optimal temporal reference characteristics at different locations rather strong correlations between qdm and mbcn together with the fact that qdm slightly outperformed its multivariate counterpart in most instances in this study point to a conclusion that the added complexity and computation time needed to implement the multivariate mbcn method might not necessarily provide added value over qdm in simulating hydrological signatures interestingly previous research on the robustness of the ba methods in nordic catchments pinpointed mbcn as a rather robust method when it comes to bias adjustment of various including multivariate features of precipitation and temperature series tootoonchi et al 2022a however results presented in this study indicated that adding a hydrological model to the modeling chain can suppress benefits gained with a particular ba method in this case mbcn in other words nonlinearity of the hydrological models beven 2012 which is inevitable to describe the highly nonlinear nature of catchment responses todini 1996 can completely overturn conclusions on the robustness of ba methods based on their performance in reproducing features of precipitation and temperature series alone regardless of how thorough and exhaustive those evaluations are we thus argue that the adjustment of the dependence between precipitation and temperature might come with the cost of hampering the accurate representation of the temporal features of these series for which the resulting impacted variable here streamflows and hydrological signatures might pay the price more specifically the copula method significantly distorts temporal characteristics of the climatic variables tootoonchi et al 2022a which affected the resulting streamflow simulations in other words multivariate ba methods do correct the dependencies between climatic variables but this does not necessarily translate into the streamflow simulations our results clearly suggest that evaluations of the ability of ba methods in reproducing climatic variables are simply not sufficient to justify their selection for a hydrological impact study at hand in nordic catchments thus examination of ba methods based on impact variables that integrate the climatic variables are crucial and we recommend further assessments of hydrological signatures in other catchments with various physiographic characteristics and hydroclimatic regimes 5 2 robustness of ba methods previous studies e g françois et al 2020 tootoonchi et al 2022a showed merits of multivariate ba methods for adjusting multiple features of cm outputs in term of hydrological simulations however the consequences of applying intricate ba methods varied across different studies and in different regions some studies demonstrated superior performance of the multivariate ba methods in specific regions singh and najafi 2020 or in reproducing specific components of runoff meyer et al 2019 other studies detected modest performance of the multivariate ba methods that led to deteriorations in the hydrological simulations van de velde et al 2022 or found no substantial difference between the performance of uni and multivariate ba methods guo et al 2020 räty et al 2018 however many of these studies analyzed only performance measures like nash sutcliffe nash and sutcliffe 1970 which could provide only limited information on the complex role of ba methods in streamflow simulations thus to provide deeper and more detailed insights into the effects of ba methods on hydrological modeling results we here used a suite of 16 hydrological signatures that described various streamflow characteristics which in turn represent an integration of the temporal and bivariate aspects of precipitation and temperature at the catchment scale hakala et al 2018 our evaluation in this study was tailored to accommodate concepts of accuracy and precision which were here applied to bias adjusted model simulations as elaborated in section 2 6 accuracy was represented by low average biases and high frequency of improvement in comparison to raw cm outputs while precision was represented by low values of variance across cms and catchments based on our holistic evaluation of performance of the ba methods in all 50 swedish catchments we found no considerable differences between the accuracy of uni and multivariate ba methods the multivariate methods performed similarly to their univariate counterparts both in reducing biases and in the frequency of improvement the only noticeable difference was the higher frequency of improvement by multivariate methods in winter flows compared to the univariate ones larger dissimilarities were however detected between distribution based and distribution free methods distribution based methods consistently resulted in lower maes and higher frequency of improvement except for the signatures representing temporal aspects i e comt or timing of minimum and maximum flows this might be attributed to their poorer performance in reproducing temporal features of climate variables i e cross copula and autocorrelation ds in the precipitation and temperature series tootoonchi et al 2022a these features might result in an improperly reproduced chronology in these series which reflects in timings of simulated streamflow series and consequently in these signatures robust ba methods are expected to consistently reduce biases in simulated streamflows and hydrological signatures i e to demonstrate high precision by yielding low variability in biases across signatures cms or catchments including different hydroclimatic regimes teutschbein and seibert 2012 application of all four ba methods generally reduced the variability in biases across both cms and catchments in comparison to raw biases the distribution based methods showed lower variability across cms meaning that distribution based methods especially copula are less sensitive to the selection of cms the lowest variability was obtained with copula which almost cancelled out any variability across cms in many signatures although this can be considered to be an appealing property of the copula method it also gives rise to concerns that in this way signals in raw cm outputs are completely concealed which might result in loss of information offered by cms cannon 2018 maraun 2016 on the contrary copula had the highest variability across catchments while the distribution free ba methods generally showed lower variability this in turn suggests that the performance of distribution free approaches in reproducing hydrological signatures is less sensitive to hydroclimatic or other properties of catchments this outcome was further confirmed by dividing the catchments into two distinct groups that represent snowmelt driven northern and rainfall driven southern streamflow regimes indeed distribution based methods in the southern catchments performed poorly in reducing biases in timing related signatures and even inflated the biases in timing of 1 day annual maxima in general the exact timing of extreme precipitation is typically not accurately captured in cm simulations lind et al 2020 this can impair the predictably of extreme streamflows in southern catchments where floods are mainly generated by heavy and or prolonged rainfall events in contrast high flows in the northern catchments are better simulated by the modelling chain as they mostly depend on the snow accumulation over a period of several months during which the exact timing of precipitation events is of less importance we here found that catchments with typically thin snowpacks located in the southwest of sweden are at particular risk of large biases in the timing of flood peaks mostly because slight melting might entirely diminish the snowpack in these catchments which then causes the flood peaks to become entirely rainfall dependent and to potentially shift to a different season the separate evaluation of the ba methods in the northern and southern catchments also shed light on the added value of application of the multivariate methods for example the multivariate methods were superior in the cold winter season in representation of all signatures depicting low flows in the northern snowmelt driven catchments apparently in these snowmelt driven environments the dependence between precipitation and temperature distinguishes between liquid precipitation and snow meyer et al 2019 and snowmelt timing defines runoff generation which consequently influences the seasonal cycle of streamflow therefore multivariate bias adjustment methods such as copula and mbcn both of which perform quite well in reproducing the dependence between precipitation and temperature tootoonchi et al 2022a also shine in the reproduction of low flow signatures in these regions with global warming causing shorter snow duration less snow accumulation on the ground and earlier snowmelt onset addor et al 2014 coppola et al 2018 klein et al 2016 ye and cohen 2013 the magnitude of high flows are expected to drastically decrease hakala et al 2020 resulting in lower streamflows after a normal snowmelt period and causing so called warm snow season droughts van loon and van lanen 2012 such changes may have considerable negative impacts on the environment e g by jeopardizing aquatic life and impeding sediment transport northern sweden perers et al 2007 also hosts many hydropower plants which require reliable operational low flow forecasts at both short and long time scales for their optimal functionality abgottspon and andersson 2016 boucher and ramos 2018 or assessment of required environmental flows gain et al 2013 shifting hydrological regimes require adaptation of farming practices to mitigate risks of loss in crops cervantes godoy et al 2014 thus even slight improvements in accuracy of low flow forecasts and or projections by applying the multivariate ba methods may prevent considerable ecological and financial losses in these regions for riparian studies that analyze 30 day annual maxima which are essential for assessment of riparian forest patch persistence distribution based ba methods were proven superior in this study in rainfall driven southern catchments multivariate methods did not demonstrate any distinct superiority in performance the univariate ds method even outperformed other three methods closely followed by copula therefore greater reduction in biases in the south was obtained by ba methods that adjust well univariate and temporal features of precipitation tootoonchi et al 2022a good performance was obtained in reproducing annual maxima and minima of different durations in these catchments these results suggest that application of distribution based methods is preferred for studies aimed at e g flood hazard or flood risk assessment or design of water intakes and estimation of environmental flows although not directly tested in their study this outcome was already suspected by zscheischler et al 2019 who argued that in cases of 1 two climate variables not being strongly correlated or 2 the process of interest e g rainfall driven floods being predominantly dependent on one climate variable the impact of adjusting dependence might be of less importance compared to the proper representation of the most influential climate variable therefore analyzing the dependence between the contributing hydrometeorological variables at the relevant spatiotemporal scale might be crucial and time saving tootoonchi et al 2022b if there is little to no evidence of dependent behaviour application of rather intricate multivariate methods might not add any significant value 5 3 a comparison based evaluation while there was not a single method that exceled according to all eight evaluation criteria the application of any ba method generally improved streamflow simulations by reducing systematic errors and increasing consistency in performance across cms and catchments these results emphasize the need for bias adjustment as an essential step that should be taken prior to any hydrological modeling exercise to ensure long term sustainability of water resources management the choice of an appropriate ba method is however not straightforward and it depends on the study location data computation resources as well as water management issue and related research question at hand concerning the two univariate methods ds and qdm distribution based ds generally outperformed distribution free qdm except for the timings of high flows and low flows between the two multivariate methods copula resulted in considerably better performance than mbcn more specifically in rainfall driven catchments mbcn performed poorly across all four categories of signatures nonetheless both multivariate methods resulted in better performance in low flows in snowmelt driven catchments mbcn outperformed copula in all four signatures within this category and generally showed a higher skill in adjusting signatures depicting timing of flows overall the two distribution based methods performed rather similarly and outperformed distribution free methods in rainfall driven catchments simple univariate ds even resulted in slightly better performance in the signatures that represent water balance and flow dynamics as well as seasonal flow whereas copula demonstrated its merits in reproducing signatures related to low and high flows this behavior was also consistent between the two distribution free ba methods where simple applications such as those for reproducing annual or seasonal flows were adjusted adequately with univariate qdm while extreme flows benefited from the application of more complex mbcn method as discussed is section 4 1 although evaluation of the ba methods clearly revealed robustness of mbcn in reproducing various features of precipitation and temperature series tootoonchi et al 2022a when applied within the entire modeling chain that includes also hydrological models this robustness fades out nevertheless it should be noted that multivariate methods that account for dependence between precipitation and temperature might be crucial for assessing compound extreme events aghakouchak et al 2014 brunner et al 2019a teutschbein et al 2023 6 concluding remarks this study evaluated the ability of four bias adjustment methods to reproduce various features of hydrologic regimes in a 42 year long record period 1962 2004 in 50 swedish catchments to this end the bias adjustment methods were applied within the ensemble of modelling chains comprising ten climate models and the hbv light hydrological model special emphases in the evaluation were placed on the differences and similarities among these methods research question 1 the results elucidate that the application of ba methods is crucial and still an essential step for hydroclimatic impact studies and that simulation outputs specifically hydrological signatures for water resources management planning strongly depend on the selection of a specific method however no method was proven superior for all signatures and according to all evaluation criteria considered in this study additionally the robustness of the ba methods across climate models catchments and hydroclimatic regimes was assessed to provide deep insights into different aspect of ba performance research question 2 we here demonstrated robust performance of distribution based methods across cms indicating that they are less sensitive to the selection of climate models with different boundary conditions and process representations than distribution base approaches all ba methods were highly sensitive to the selection of catchments which emphasizes the need to incorporate process understanding to the bias adjustment step to provide bias adjusted and simultaneously physically meaningful data for hydrological impact studies in different parts of the world however these results remain to be confirmed for other study areas with different hydroclimatic conditions and streamflow regimes finally in this study we sought to identify the most suitable ba method s for the simulation of hydrological signatures relevant for water resources management under changing climate in the nordic regions research question 3 to conclude in most cases the simple and straightforward univariate distribution scaling method is the best choice as it has the highest potential to robustly reduce biases across a variety of signatures application of the multivariate methods copula or mbcn might be worth the additional efforts only in snowmelt driven catchments or for particular purposes that require correct timing of high or low flows in these cases however one should be aware that these multivariate methods might add further uncertainties due to various assumptions for adjustment of dependence between precipitation and temperature and consequent modifications of temporal characteristics credit authorship contribution statement faranak tootoonchi conceptualization

1754,hydrological climate change impact studies depend on climatic variables simulated by climate models due to parametrization and numerous simplifications however climate model outputs come with systematic biases compared to the observations in the past decade several methods of different complexity and dimensionality for adjustment of such biases were introduced but their benefits for impact studies and accurate streamflow projections are still debated in this paper we evaluated the ability of two state of the art advanced multivariate bias adjustment methods to accurately reproduce 16 hydrological signatures and compared their performance against two parsimonious univariate bias adjustment methods based on a multi criteria performance evaluation the results indicated that all bias adjustment methods considerably reduced biases and increased the consistency of simulated hydrological signatures the added value of multivariate methods in maintaining dependence structures between precipitation and temperature was not systematically reflected in the resulting hydrological signatures as they were generally outperformed by univariate methods the benefits of multivariate methods only emerged for low flow signatures in snowmelt driven catchments based on these findings we identified the most suitable bias adjustment methods for water resources management in nordic regions under a changing climate and provided practical guidelines for the selection of bias adjustment methods given specific research targets and hydroclimatic regimes keywords climate change bias adjustment bias correction climate model hydrological signatures high latitudes data availability the cordex data used is available at http www cordex org 1 introduction streamflow regimes are considerably impacted by climate change due to simultaneous effects of rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns villarini and wasko 2021 higher temperatures cause increasing atmospheric water demand which in turn changes precipitation timing and amount cheng et al 2019 hanus et al 2021 ipcc 2014 at the same time higher temperatures affect the timing and duration of snow season gergel et al 2017 snowmelt hakala et al 2018 and resulting streamflow clow 2010 concurrent shifts in precipitation and temperature also influence the availability and access to water clifton et al 2018 as well as the timing and magnitude of extremes like floods or droughts dankers et al 2014 dankers and feyen 2009 villarini and wasko 2021 in nordic countries changes in hydroclimatic drivers of streamflow have already been observed through warming temperatures resulting in shorter ice cover durations hallerbäck et al 2021 and general wetting trends chen et al 2021a current future projections indicate an intensification of climate change in the northern hemisphere by the end of the century ipcc 2021 which would inevitably influence flow regimes in nordic regions teutschbein et al 2015 anticipated changes include e g a decrease in daily flows matti et al 2017 shorter snow seasons hallerbäck et al 2021 an earlier onset of spring floods with lower peaks slightly lower summer flows and higher winter base flows in snowmelt driven catchments teutschbein et al 2015 together these changes could lead to a higher frequency of rainfall driven floods in nordic catchments bergström et al 2001 matti et al 2016 and to a shift in the current flood regimes from spring summer to autumn winter arheimer and lindström 2015 vormoor et al 2015 in contrast rainfall driven catchments in southern regions of the nordic countries will likely experience streamflow reductions during most of the year except for winter due to increasing evapotranspiration rates and longer growing seasons teutschbein et al 2017 such shifts can severely limit the availability of water for ecosystems carpenter et al 1992 and adversely affect human livelihood by threatening water availability for agriculture and hydropower berghuijs et al 2014 to develop efficient mitigation and adaptation strategies water resource managers need reliable information generated by hydrological impact studies hydrological impact studies rely on a modeling chain to simulate future streamflow projections hakala et al 2019 wagener et al 2022 climate models cms provide global scale meteorological data representative for one or several greenhouse gas concentration pathways refsgaard et al 2014 the data can be further utilized as initial and boundary conditions for regional cms to obtain meteorological projects at finer spatial and temporal resolutions theoretically the outputs of the regional cms could be used as direct input to hydrological models to simulate climate impacts on the water cycle at the catchment scale hakala et al 2019 nevertheless due to parametrization and numerical limitations cms generally provide biased simulations with systematic errors compared to observations maraun 2016 teutschbein and seibert 2012 these biases can manifest in the amount timing and the dependence between the climate variables at hand françois et al 2020 hakala et al 2018 piani and haerter 2012 tootoonchi et al 2022a wilcke et al 2013 to reduce these biases different bias adjustment methods have been suggested these range from simple univariate bias adjustment ba methods such as delta change quantile mapping qm or the delta mapping method dm to more advanced multivariate ba methods such as copula and bias correction in multiple dimensions mbcn univariate ba methods adjust only one climate variable at the time e g in hakala et al 2018 teutschbein seibert 2012 in particular the qm methods such as distribution scaling ds and quantile delta mapping qdm are often preferred due to their simple implementation procedure and their arguably robust capabilities to adjust various aspects of cm simulations berg et al 2022 gudmundsson et al 2012 teutschbein and seibert 2012 tootoonchi et al 2022a multivariate methods however account for the interlinkages between climate variables and adjust both univariate and multivariate characteristics of these series e g in françois et al 2020 meyer et al 2019 räty et al 2018 mehrotra et al 2018 mehrotra and sharma 2021 which can be relevant for extreme and compound events meyer et al 2019 tootoonchi et al 2022a zscheischler et al 2019 but these methods can be more challenging to implement compared to univariate ones as they demand more computational resources and advanced statistical and programming skills of the user they may also adversely affect temporal characteristics of the climate variables for example they can distort autocorrelation in the series françois et al 2020 tootoonchi et al 2022a van de velde et al 2022 in a nordic context previous research showed that both multivariate methods copula and mbcn perform similarly to their univariate counterparts ds and qdm respectively in adjustment of biases in univariate characteristics of precipitation and temperature series in numerous swedish catchments tootoonchi et al 2022a however the multivariate ba methods outperformed their univariate counterparts in reproducing the positive dependence between precipitation and temperature during colder winter months the negative dependence during warm summer months and the clausius clapeyron relation correlations between precipitation and temperature varied across catchments i e latitudes and climates and seasons although both multivariate methods performed well in this regard they were inferior to the univariate methods in adjusting temporal characteristics such as cross correlation considering the advantages of multivariate methods in accounting for dependence between the adjusted variables their impact on the accuracy of simulated streamflows is not clear specifically the question if the use of advanced multivariate ba methods results in considerably more reliable streamflow projectionscompared to their univariate alternatives has remained opened on one hand it is well recognized that univariate behavior of climate variables such as mean and variance of temperature and precipitation should be well represented guo et al 2020 teutschbein and seibert 2012 tootoonchi et al 2022a to properly simulate future streamflows on the other hand other characteristics such as temporal behavior or the dependence between precipitation and temperature may also play a key role in the accuracy of streamflow simulations chen et al 2021a for instance dependence between precipitation and temperature influences water holding capacity of the atmosphere panthou et al 2014 which can affect both intensity and timing of extreme precipitation myhre et al 2019 evapotranspiration aghakouchak et al 2014 and snowmelt hakala et al 2018 as a result preserving the dependence between climatic variables could be critical to reliably project future water balance as well as the timing and severity of future floods or droughts guo et al 2020 meyer et al 2019 zehe and sivapalan 2009 to reliably simulate streamflow from simulated climate data hydrological models need to be calibrated pool et al 2017 model performance in the calibration and evaluation periods have traditionally been quantified in term of efficiency measures such as nash sutcliffe nash and sutcliffe 1970 or kling gupta coefficients gupta et al 2009 yilmaz et al 2010 while these measures are good indicators of the overall model performance they do not indicate the ability of a hydrological model to reproduce specific features of streamflow regimes i e hydrological signatures such as the timing or magnitude of seasonal high or low flows addor and fischer 2015 feng and beighley 2020 mendoza et al 2016 such signatures are however essential for flood hazard assessment and water resource management brunner et al 2021 todorović et al 2022 thus we argue that using a range of hydrological signatures kabuya et al 2020 mcmillan 2021 zhang et al 2018 is an essential to complement traditional efficiency measures and enable a process informed evaluation of ba methods while a number of studies evaluated the impact of univariate ba methods on simulated hydrological variables e g hakala et al 2018 muerth et al 2013 teutschbein seibert 2012 relatively few studies evaluated multivariate ba methods in this context for instance räty et al 2018 compared streamflow simulations after applications of two univariate and two multivariate ba methods in four european catchments but did not find any substantial improvement after application of multivariate ba methods in these catchments meyer et al 2019 however found that multivariate ba outperformed univariate ba when simulating water storage in snow and glaciers in two swiss alpine catchments a north american study found that multivariate ba methods improve accuracy of streamflow simulations more in catchments of arid and warm regions than in catchments in colder regions with a prolonged snow season guo et al 2020 it remains however unclear if these findings can be transferred to nordic catchments additionally research in this field has so far produced little guidance for impact modelers who are interested in one or several specific streamflow characteristics and who need to select a ba method that is both easily applicable and fit for a specific task at hand to bridge these gaps this study assessed the suitability of different ba methods for accurate reproduction of hydrological signatures relevant for water resources management in the nordic regions under climate change this assessment was based on the outputs of 10 cms in 50 swedish catchments which covered a large variety of climatic and hydrologic conditions climate variables in this multi catchment ensemble were adjusted with two parsimonious univariate and two advanced multivariate bias adjustment methods bias adjusted temperature and precipitation series were then used to force the hydrological hbv light model bergström 1976 lindström et al 1997 seibert and vis 2012 and to simulate streamflows in each catchment evaluation of the ba methods was based on a comprehensive set of hydrological signatures describing a the overall water balance and streamflow dynamics b seasonal streamflows c low and d high flow characteristics the evaluation was tailored to enable addressing the following research questions 1 performance and similarities of ba methods can the application of ba methods improve the accuracy in reproducing hydrological signatures in nordic catchments and are there any considerable differences among the ba methods or recurring similarities can be found 2 robustness of ba methods do more complex multivariate ba methods outperform parsimonious univariate ba methods by frequent improvements and consistent performance across a climate models b catchments and c hydroclimatic regimes 3 comparison based recommendations can we identify one or several ba method s that consistently outperform s the other methods in simulating hydrological signatures relevant for water resources management under changing climate in the nordic regions we synthetized all results to provide specific recommendations for the selection of ba methods depending on the hydrological signature of interest and put these recommendations in the context of effective water resources management under changing climate conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 study area sweden a country with a land area of roughly 408 000 km2 is heavily forested 69 of the land area with a large number of lakes wetlands and streams 9 roughly 8 of the land is covered by shrubs and grass land 8 are agricultural land 3 urban areas and 3 open land and glaciers sweden stretches over three köppen geiger beck et al 2018 climatic zones fig 1 a 1 the polar tundra climate zone et with monthly mean temperatures below 10 c covers the scandinavian mountains in north western sweden 2 the subarctic boreal climate dfc with cool summers and winters with persistent seasonal snow and soil frost covers central and northern sweden and 3 the warm summer hemiboreal climate zone dfb covers southern sweden in this study we used a set of 50 swedish catchments fig 1a spread latitudinally from 55 95 n to 68 37 n and longitudinally between 11 54 e to 22 31 e catchment areas spanned from 2 to 8425 km2 with average elevations between 12 and 942 m a s l selection of the catchments was primarily dictated by the availability of data i e only those catchments for which continuous daily temperature precipitation and streamflow observations were available for the period 1961 2004 were included additional selection criteria included a low percentage of lakes 37 glaciers and urbanized areas 3 1 and a low degree 30 2 of regulation i e reservoir volume relative to the mean annual flow volume from its draining area cf todorović et al 2022 the resulting 50 catchments were spatially distributed across all three climatic zones of sweden fig 1a and thus featured diverse hydroclimatic characteristics during the period 1961 2004 total annual precipitation over the chosen catchments ranged from 1500 mm year1 in north western sweden to 400 mm year 1 in southern sweden fig 1b while annual mean temperature varied from 3 0 c in the north to 7 7 c in the south fig 1c hydrological regimes also featured a north south gradient fig 1a right panel with snowmelt driven regimes in northern regions and rainfall driven regimes in southern regions arheimer and lindström 2015 matti et al 2017 2 2 data 2 2 1 observed variables precipitation temperature and streamflow gridded daily mean values of observed temperature and precipitation were obtained from the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi as spatially interpolated 4 km 4 km national grids for the period 1961 2020 johansson 2002 daily streamflow records were downloaded from a publicly accessible streamflow database https vattenwebb smhi se hosted by smhi while geospatial data of the catchment boundaries for each of the 50 catchments were obtained from smhi s svar database eklund 2011 2 2 2 climate data to cover a wide range of uncertainty we used outputs from different combinations of global and regional climate models cms for the historic period of 1961 2004 table 1 acquired from the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 together with coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex initiative jacob et al 2014 we selected only those cms that had both historic and future precipitation and temperature simulations available until the end of the century 2100 for three greenhouse gas concentration trajectories i e rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 and for the highest available resolution 0 11 roughly 12 5 km this selection protocol left us with 10 rcm gcm combinations if simulations were available in several versions e g v1 and v2 we opted for the most recent version i e v2 gridded daily precipitation and temperature data were spatially averaged over each catchment from values in all grid cells partly covering the catchment of interest 2 3 bias adjustment of climate models we selected four different ba methods two commonly used univariate methods and two more recently developed multivariate methods the selected methods either rely on a theoretical probably distribution hereafter referred to as distribution based methods or follow a distribution free approach while other univariate methods e g linear scaling lenderink et al 2007 or variance scaling chen et al 2011 as well as alternative multivariate methods e g dynamical optimal transport correction robin et al 2019 exist the four selected methods represent the most frequently utilized to date note that multivariate methods can additionally be categorized according to their conceptual features i e if they show stochastic or deterministic behavior or the order in which the dependence is adjusted françois et al 2020 each ba method was calibrated to adjust cm simulations to precipitation and temperature observed over 22 years between 1961 and 1982 precipitation and temperature data recorded in the subsequent 22 years evaluation period 1983 2004 were adjusted directly based on the parameters estimated during the calibration period this set up was selected both due to data availability i e historic simulations of cmip5 cm outputs span until 2005 and due to the requirements of equally long time series for forming the empirical copula for each period ba was performed on a monthly basis to preserve seasonal variations in accordance with the common practice drizzle days with 1 mm day 1 of precipitation were set to dry days i e days with zero precipitation before the evaluation of the ba methods teutschbein and seibert 2012 tootoonchi et al 2022a 2 3 1 univariate methods quantile mapping qm is a category of univariate ba methods that adjusts the entire probability distributions of cm outputs to match the corresponding distribution of observations chen et al 2013 gudmundsson et al 2012 qm methods have been shown to be superior to other univariate methods such as linear scaling or variance scaling teutschbein and seibert 2012 and are thus considered the benchmark to compare multivariate methods with we adopted two versions of qm 1 the distribution based method called distribution scaling ds and 2 the distribution free method called quantile delta mapping qdm distribution scaling ds implies the selection of particular theoretical distribution families to form cumulative distribution functions cdfs of variables typically a gamma distribution with the shape parameter α and the scale parameter β is used to represent precipitation intensity on wet days thom 1951 while a gaussian distribution with mean µ and variance σ is often applied to temperature of the entire record in line with the previous studies e g gudmundsson et al 2012 teutschbein seibert 2012 yang et al 2010 our preliminary analysis confirmed the suitability of these two distribution families to represent cm outputs and hence we used them in this paper in contrast to ds the distribution free quantile delta mapping qdm approach explicitly preserves relative changes in simulated cm outputs li et al 2010 and at the same time adjusts biases in quantiles of the simulated variables by taking into account observations in the calibration period cannon et al 2015 olsson et al 2009 willems and vrac 2011 this method is thus beneficial if there is enough confidence in the plausibility of the change signal simulated by the cm cannon 2018 maraun 2016 a visual representation of qdm approach in comparison to other quantile mapping methods can be found in the paper by berg et al 2022 2 3 2 multivariate methods in contrast to univariate ba methods multivariate methods additionally adjust the dependence between variables along with their univariate features piani and haerter 2012 two frequently used multivariate methods in impact studies include distribution based copula and distribution free multivariate bias correction in n dimensions methods mbcn in copula adjustment methods the joint rank dependence of two or more variables is represented by a mathematical function which couples their marginal distributions for two continuous random set of variables x and y the copula can be represented as sklar 1959 1 h x y c f x g y where h x y features the cumulative distribution function cdf of the bivariate distribution of x and y f x and g y are their respective univariate marginal cdfs and c the copula function that joins two marginal cdfs together for a comprehensive introduction to the general concept and mathematical basis of copulas the reader is referred to seminal papers by genest favre 2007 and nelsen 2006 for adjusting biases in cm simulations copulas were either used by fitting theoretical copula families to the series li et al 2014 räty et al 2018 or in empirical form bárdossy and pegram 2012 piani and haerter 2012 vrac 2018 here we tested four theoretical copula families consisting of three archimedean copulas frank clayton and gumbel and one elliptical copula gaussian to apply the copulas the formal procedure by tootoonchi et al 2022b was adopted in this study first the data was pre processed and screened for non stationarity trends and ties ties are data with the same rank such as days with zero precipitation dry days as daily data featured numerous dry days a jittering algorithm similar to the one proposed by pappadà et al 2017 was applied to the precipitation series to break the ties in this approach adjustment of precipitation is performed by replacement of zero precipitation values i e dry days with extremely small random but nonzero values vrac et al 2016 thereafter theoretical copula families were fitted to the observed data to ensure the suitability of the selected theoretical copula families the cramér von mises goodness of fit test was applied genest et al 2009 when the test failed to provide an admissible copula i e the test yielded p value 0 05 following e g brunner et al 2019b genest et al 2009 genest and remillard 2008 empirical copulas were used instead using the fitted copula parameters a new copula was computed for the cm simulated precipitation and temperature creating adjusted dependence characteristics thereafter the ds method was applied on the margins i e precipitation and temperature to adapt the univariate characteristics of these series for more detailed explanation of the copula approach the reader is referred to other papers e g genest and favre 2007 tootoonchi et al 2022b recently cannon 2018 introduced mbcn to the bias adjustment community which is available as a free r package https rdrr io cran mbc man mbcn html since its publication mbcn has been adopted as the benchmark for testing multivariate methods in numerous studies e g de velde et al 2022 françois et al 2020 meyer et al 2019 singh reza najafi 2020 in this method randomly generated orthogonal matrices are repeatedly applied on the variables rotating them in space at each rotation a selected univariate method e g qdm is applied on each of variables separately to adjust biases in their univariate features this iterative process is continued until the variables feature multivariate similarity according to the following energy distance metric

each of the 50 catchments with the standard version of the hbv light model seibert and vis 2012 which has been widely adopted in many regions seibert and bergström 2022 the model consists of 1 snow 2 soil moisture 3 response and 4 routing routines seibert and vis 2012 in this study we used the spatially lumped standard version of the hbv light model the model required daily precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration as inputs series of daily potential evapotranspiration were computed from the temperature series observed and simulated by the cms raw and bias adjusted by applying the hamon method hamon 1961 2 4 2 calibration and evaluation of hbv light following a one year warm up period from 1961 to 1962 hbv light was calibrated in each catchment against 21 years of daily streamflow observations from 1963 to 1982 the calibration was performed in each catchment separately by using the built in gap optimization algorithm seibert 2000 the gap optimization was run 5000 times after randomly drawing 50 initial parameter sets the model calibration was performed by maximizing a composite objective function fobj which was selected to achieve a balanced model performance in high and low flows and in reproducing streamflow volume 3 f obj 0 75 n s e 0 2 log n s e 0 05 v e where nse denotes the high flow sensitive nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe

ve denotes volumetric efficiency criss and winston 2008 values of the three components of the objective function in the calibration and evaluation periods fig 2 suggested a good model performance and therefore provide a solid ground for assessing the performance of the selected ba methods in reproducing hydrological signatures 2 4 3 streamflow simulations the calibrated hbv light model was then used to simulate daily streamflow in each of the 50 catchments for the period 1963 2004 with three different sets of input 1 observed precipitation and temperature the reference simulations 2 raw precipitation and temperature simulated by the 10 cms and 3 bias adjusted precipitation and temperature simulated by the 10 cms and the four ba methods to reduce the effect of model uncertainty on the evaluation of ba methods a set of 16 hydrological signatures table 2 see section 2 4 3 obtained from streamflows simulated with the observed precipitation and temperature was used as reference hydrological signatures obtained from streamflows simulated with raw or bias adjusted cm precipitation and temperature i e inputs 2 and 3 were thus evaluated against this reference rather than against signatures of streamflow observations this evaluation protocol eliminates the uncertainties caused by hydrological model structure and or parameter estimates and is in line with the recommendations by hakala et al 2019 for the assessment of uncertainty stemming from the ba methods 2 5 hydrological signatures the 16 signatures were selected to capture complementary characteristics of streamflow regimes which relate to a water balance and flow dynamics b seasonal flows c low flows and d high flows table 2 considering that the selected signatures generally reflect annual streamflow behavior e g spring flows mean annual flows or timing of the spring pulse day they were firstly computed from daily streamflows separately for each year and then averaged over the entire period between 1963 and 2004 such protocol which is adopted in many hydroclimatic studies suggests evaluate of ba methods performance over long periods françois et al 2020 maraun and widmann 2018 focusing on the entire 42 year period was recognized as the most robust split sample strategy maraun and widmann 2018 shen et al 2022 and as such was also applied in numerous previous studies e g meyer et al 2019 zscheischler et al 2019 2 6 evaluation framework for the comparison of bias correction methods we compared the performance of four ba methods section 2 3 in reproducing 16 hydrological signatures section 2 5 obtained from simulated streamflows with the outputs of 10 different cms section 2 2 2 and observed climate series in the 50 swedish catchments section 2 1 the evaluation was based on absolute errors mae computed as follows 4 mae 1 n i 1 n r i r ref where r i denotes a signature computed from the outputs of the hbv light model forced with the raw and four bias adjusted outputs of the climate modelling chains separately conversely r r e f denotes a signature obtained with the reference model i e model forced with observed precipitation and temperature we then addressed the research questions in a framework consisting of 1 performance 2 robustness and 3 a comparison based evaluation of ba methods which guided the practical recommendations in the final section of this paper the performance of ba methods was visually analyzed with the help of separate heatmaps for raw and the four bias adjusted cm outputs which allowed an evaluation of emerging patterns across catchments and cms the pearson correlation coefficient pearson 1920 based on 500 pairs of values 50 catchments 10 cms for each possible combination of the 5 cm simulations 1 raw and 4 ba methods for each of the 16 hydrological signatures table 2 was then used to detect similarities in the performance of the applied ba methods across catchments and cms in this study we considered ba method pairs with correlation coefficients higher than 0 7 similar the overall robustness of ba methods was evaluated based on the concepts of accuracy and precision that have often been applied to measurements mcmillan et al 2018 or model predictions wagener et al 2022 and are here applied to the bias adjusted model simulations accuracy here refers to the ability of a bias adjusted model to yield simulations close to the observations i e have a low bias and it was quantified by averaging maes across the 50 catchments and 10 cms 500 instances and also by the frequency of improvements i e how many times a ba method reduced the raw bias precision refers to the low variability of bias adjusted simulations provided by multiple cms i e have a low variance thus the variance across cms and across catchments was computed under the assumption that robust ba methods perform consistently well i e have a low variability regardless of the climate models used or catchment properties to further check the consistency across hydroclimatic regimes the robustness was analyzed separately for the snowmelt driven regimes in northern regions i e within et and dfb climate zones and for rainfall driven regimes in southern regions i e dfc climate zone the differences in runoff regimes between these two groups of catchments are clearly shown in fig 1a the snowmelt driven catchments were characterized by a pronounced runoff seasonality with the highest runoff in spring and early summer as opposed to rainfall dominated catchments that exhibited rather subtle runoff variation throughout the year the final comparison based evaluation was based on the following eight criteria which described each ba method s ability to strongly reduce biases i e to yield low mae values criterion 1 frequently reduce biases i e to have a high frequency of improvement criterion 2 robustly reduce biases across various cms that had different boundary conditions and process representations i e to yield a low variance in mae values across cms criterion 3 robustly reduce biases across a multitude of catchments with various catchment characteristics and hydroclimatic properties i e to yield a low variance in mae values across catchments criterion 4 strongly reduce biases across hydroclimatic regimes dominated by snowfall and melt i e to have low mae values in northern catchments criterion 5 frequently reduce biases across hydroclimatic regimes dominated by snowfall and melt i e to have a high frequency of improvements in the northern catchments criterion 6 strongly reduce biases across hydroclimatic regimes dominated by rainfall i e to have low mae values in southern catchments criterion 7 frequently reduce biases across hydroclimatic regimes dominated by rainfall i e to have a high frequency of improvements in the southern catchments criterion 8 for each of these criteria the performance of every ba method was categorized as high 75 of max min range medium 75 and greater than 25 or low 25 to reveal if particular ba methods consistently outperformed the remaining ones in simulating signatures relevant for water resources management under changing climate 3 results 3 1 performance of ba methods 3 1 1 performance across the signature groups 3 1 1 1 water balance and runoff dynamics signatures runoff signatures simulated with raw cms typically featured considerable biases expressed as mae for annual mean flow q mean raw biases were as high as 2 mm day 1 fig 3 a left panel nearly three times the reference value i e mean flow simulated with the observed meteorological input the runoff coefficient q coeff demonstrated substantial biases of up to 0 3 fig 3b signatures characterizing streamflow dynamics also showed considerable biases in raw simulations the center of mass comt was biased up to 35 days or roughly one month fig 3c and biases in the timing of the spring flood spd reached up to 200 days i e more than 6 months fig 3d considerably stronger biases in spd were detected in southern catchments with latitudes below 60 n fig 3d all ba methods were able to reduce the initial biases in these signatures obtained from raw cm outputs fig 3a d main differences were visible between the two groups of distribution based ds and copula and distribution free methods qdm and mbcn while the differences between uni ds and qdm and multivariate methods copula an mbcn were less pronounced biases in raw q mean were reduced from 2 mm day 1 down to a maximum of 0 2 mm day 1 with distribution based methods ds and copula and down to a maximum of 0 4 mm day 1 with distribution free approaches i e qdm and mbcn fig 3a biases in raw q coeff were considerably reduced after application of all the methods fig 3b the distribution based methods reduced maes to maximum of 0 03 and distribution free methods up to 0 06 fig 3b for comt all four ba methods performed similarly resulting in biases between 13 days with ds and 16 days with copula fig 3c biases in spd after applying the distribution based methods were noticeably lower approximately up to 70 days than after applying the distribution free methods that resulted in biases up to approximately 120 days fig 3d within both groups of distribution based and distribution free methods similar patterns emerged in the remaining biases in all signatures of the group fig 3 the exception in this regard was spd fig 3d for which the patterns obtained with copula diverged from those of the remaining methods generally patterns obtained with all ba methods differed from those obtained with the raw cm outputs in all cases with exception of spd which was characterized by pronounced change with the latitude in contrast to the variation across latitudes i e catchments the variation in biases across cms generally did not exhibit any apparent pattern i e no cm consistently resulted in lower biases across all signatures of the group obtained and with all ba methods 3 1 1 2 seasonal flows signatures seasonal flows obtained with uncorrected cm outputs featured biases of up to 2 3 mm day 1 in q spring fig 4 a and up to 6 mm day 1 in q summer fig 4b the maes were however lower for the other two seasons only reaching as high as 1 6 mm day 1 for q autumn fig 4c and 1 1 mm day 1 for q winter fig 4d in all four cases raw biases were substantial and at least twice the reference values in case of q autumn even 7 times biases in seasonal flows also featured a distinct spatial pattern with much higher mae values in the north in the spring and summer fig 4a b whereas the opposite behavior was observed in the winter fig 4d the distribution free methods qdm and mbcn reduced biases in q spring fig 4a to a maximum of 0 7 mm day 1 while the distribution based methods resulted in biases of up to 0 55 mm day 1 and 0 35 mm day 1 with ds and copula respectively fig 4a for q summer fig 4b univariate ba methods resulted in maes of up to 1 8 mm day 1 while simulations based on the multivariate ba methods featured smaller errors up to 1 3 mm day 1 distribution based methods performed similarly for q autumn maximum mae of 0 83 mm day 1 fig 4c and generally better than distribution free approaches which performed similarly taking values up to 1 3 mm day 1 through simulations with all four methods bias ranges in q winter fig 4d were somewhat similar and took values of up to 0 45 mm day 1 with distribution based methods and up to 0 55 mm day 1 with the distribution free ones in all signatures of this group fig 4a d the two distribution free methods exhibited similar mae patterns furthermore similarities in the mae patterns could also be observed in the univariate methods ds and qdm for q summer fig 4b and q winter fig 4d the copula method resulted in a completely different mae pattern in q winter fig 4d particularly in the southern catchments additionally q summer and q winter exhibited a distinct spatial pattern i e maes in q summer were notably higher in the northern catchments while q winter showed the opposite pattern the patterns obtained with the raw cm outputs were generally altered by applying the ba methods although a slight resemblance in mae patterns could be detected for the summer and winter flows visual inspection of the panels with the signatures obtained with bias adjusted climate variables did not identify any cm that consistently yielded lower biases across the ba methods and signatures 3 1 1 3 low flows signatures biases in the low flow frequency lffreq fig 5 a and timing of low flows t minq30 fig 5b were generally high up to 100 days for simulations with uncorrected cm outputs the other two signatures representing the magnitude of low flows featured biases as high as 0 22 mm day 1 in minq d7 fig 5c and up to 0 25 mm day 1 in minq d30 fig 5d both of which exceeded the reference values by more than three times biases in all low flow signatures with bias adjusted cm simulations were considerably cut down the mae values in lffreq fig 5a were similar across all four ba methods ranging between 40 days after applying the distribution based methods and 45 days after the application of the distribution free methods the distribution based methods resulted in lower ranges of maes in t minq30 up to 40 days with ds and up to 55 days with copula fig 5b compared to distribution free methods which showed errors of up to 80 days after applying qdm and up to 100 days after applying mbcn for minq d7 fig 5c and minq d30 fig 5d ds qdm and mbcn reduced the original raw biases to a similar extent resulting in mae values of up to 0 16 mm day 1 and 0 18 mm day 1 respectively however the application of the copula method resulted in considerably lower biases of only up to 0 8 mm day 1 in minq d7 fig 5c and of 0 1 mm day 1 in minq d30 fig 5d while similarities in the mae patterns could be observed between distribution free methods fig 5a d the copula approach again stood out by featuring considerably different patterns in t minq30 fig 5b maes in none of the signatures obtained with bias adjusted cm outputs exhibited any apparent pattern across cms or latitudes except for copula for t minq30 that yielded slightly higher maes in the south such behavior was consistent with the signatures obtained with raw outputs which did not display any distinct north south pattern nevertheless close similarities between the patterns obtained from raw and adjusted cm outputs could not be detected in these signatures 3 1 1 4 high flows signatures high flow signatures based on the uncorrected cm outputs featured considerable biases fig 6 a d biases in the frequency related signature hffreq fig 6a and timing related signature t maxq1 fig 6b were up to 100 days particularly in southern catchments in the latter maes in maxq d30 fig 6c and maxq d1 fig 6d featured higher maes in the northern catchments of up to 8 mm day 1 respective 12 mm day 1 both of which amounted to over two times the references values after bias adjustment biases in hffreq fig 6a were considerably reduced with all four methods taking values of up to 20 days with the distribution based methods ds and copula and up to 35 days for the distribution free methods qdm and mbcn a noteworthy pattern emerged while all four ba methods were able to considerably reduce biases in t maxq1 in the northern catchments the distribution based methods struggled in the southern catchments and basically did not result in a distinct reduction of maes fig 6b on the contrary after the application of ds several catchments featured biases in t maxq1 as large as 100 days which exceeded the original raw biases this problem was even more pronounced for the copula method which to a large extent inflated the raw biases in the southern catchments fig 6b for maxq d30 fig 6c all methods performed similarly with copula featuring the lowest biases up to 2 mm day 1 and qdm the highest biases up to 3 5 mm day 1 biases in maxq d1 fig 6d featured similar ranges for ds copula and mbcn up to 5 5 mm day 1 while maes with qdm were somewhat larger exhibiting values of up to 8 mm day 1 fig 6d for all high flow signatures similarities could be observed in patterns obtained with the distribution free methods qdm and mbcn note that the patterns in maes after applying the copula approach were again somewhat different from the other methods fig 6a d most evidently we could observe horizontal lines in fig 6a d which indicated rather low variation across the cms the mae values in hffreq fig 6a did not feature a distinct north south gradient however spatial variations across latitudes were apparent in the other three high flow signatures for example biases in t maxq1 fig 6b were mostly higher in the southern catchments while the opposite behavior was exhibited by maxq d30 and maxq d1 as for the latter larger biases in the northern catchments were also obtained with the raw cm outputs no cms could be identified as the most robust in the ensemble since no cm consistently yielded the lowest residual biases 4 similarity of ba patterns similarities between the patterns in the signatures were detected in many instances as outlined in section 3 1 1 first we analyzed to what degree ba methods maintained the patterns obtained with raw cm data i e correlations between raw and each of the ba methods thereafter we examined the correlations between all pairwise combinations of the four ba methods we considered the pearson correlation coefficients greater than 0 70 to be an indication of a strong correlation overall correlations between the signatures obtained from adjusted cm outputs and those obtained with raw ones were weak as indicated by rather low values of the pearson correlation coefficients signatures that had the lowest correlations to mae obtained from raw simulations included comt fig 7 a third panel t minq30 fig 7c second panel and hffreq fig 7d first panel with the copula method showing the lowest correlation with uncorrected cms in these signatures the highest correlation coefficients between maes in raw and the bias adjusted values were detected in q mean q summer maxq d30 and maxq d1 in all cases except for q mean the multivariate methods copula and mbcn featured stronger correlations with raw cm than the univariate ones ds and qdm as opposed to correlations to the signatures obtained from raw cm outputs some rather strong correlations between signatures obtained with ba methods could be detected more specifically strong correlations were detected in three pairs of ba methods 1 most frequently between distribution free methods qdm and mbcn for all 16 signatures 2 between distribution based methods ds and copula for seven signatures and 3 between the univariate methods ds and qdm for four signatures the correlation between the two multivariate methods was generally lower than for the other couples i e in the range 0 03 0 63 4 1 robustness of ba methods 4 1 1 overall robustness all ba methods were able to consistently reduce the initial raw biases which was demonstrated by considerably smaller mae values averaged over all 50 catchments and 10 cms compared to the simulations based on raw cm data indicated by smaller circles in fig 8 biases in the signatures related to water balance and flow dynamics fig 8a as well as in the seasonal flows fig 8b were generally reduced i e the application of the ba methods resulted in average bias reductions of more than 50 of the initial bias biases in signatures related to low fig 8c and high flows fig 8d were reduced less well which was particularly pronounced in e g timings of 30 day low flows t minq30 fig 8c and of the annual maximum flows t maxq1 fig 8d to examine whether the ba methods reduced the biases not just in a few instances but rather consistently across all 500 simulations 50 catchments 10 cms we also analyzed the frequency of improvements these results generally corroborated the mae values water balance and flow dynamics signatures fig 8a as well as seasonal flows fig 8b had somewhat higher rates of bias reductions on average improvements in 81 and 78 of simulations respectively compared to the other signatures application of the ba methods led to improvements in 74 of the simulated low flow signatures fig 8c and 75 of high flow signatures fig 8d the lowest frequency of improvements was found in t minq30 and t maxq1 both 57 while the highest frequency was achieved in summer flows q summer 93 fig 8b and in the runoff coefficients q coeff 92 fig 8a in most cases the best results were obtained with the distribution based methods ds and copula which resulted in lower mae values than their distribution free counterparts but also a higher frequency of improvements the only two signatures for which the opposite pattern was obtained were t minq30 and t maxq1 it is also noteworthy that uni and multivariate methods within the same group of either distribution based or distribution free ba approaches generally resulted in rather similar values of averaged mae and frequency of improvements especially in the signatures related to water balance and flow dynamics fig 8a and the seasonal flows fig 8b the only exception in this regard was the copula method which struggled to adjust biases in t minq30 fig 8c and even inflated existing biases in t maxq1 fig 8d 4 1 2 consistency across climate models the application of ba methods led to noticeably reduced mae values compared to raw across all climate models for all 16 signatures with exception of copula and t maxq1 as elaborated in detail in the previous section the reduction in biases is apparent not only in the median values but also in the interquartile ranges of mae values across the 10 cms which were consistently smaller than those of the raw simulations fig 9 distribution free methods generally showed higher variability of the errors i e larger inconsistency than distribution based methods fig 9 depicted by the circles on top of each boxplot representing the variance with mbcn demonstrating the highest variance across cms for half of the signatures and never featuring the lowest variance this was closely followed by qdm which featured the highest variance in five signatures and the lowest in one in contrast copula stood out by resulting in the lowest variance across cm i e the highest consistency for 14 of the 16 signatures closely followed by ds fig 9 the largest variances i e inconsistencies were found in the low flow signatures fig 9c for which the minimum maximum ranges across the cms were relatively large and in particular for minq d7 and minq d30 although these ranges were not excessive in the absolute terms i e they took values up to 0 05 mm day 1 they were nearly as large as for the raw simulations especially with the qdm method 4 1 3 consistency across catchments the performance of ba methods was generally more variable across catchments compared to their variance across cms which was reflected by a wider interquartile range and a larger variance fig 10 however the application of the ba methods still led to a visible reductions in the median mae for all signatures and in lower variability of mae values across catchments which was consistently smaller than raw values for the majority of signatures the distribution based methods ds and copula featured generally a higher variability i e larger inconsistencies with copula having the largest variance in nine of the 16 signatures and ds in four cases distribution free methods were mostly associated with lower variance of maes with qdm featuring only once and mbcn only twice the highest variance among the ba methods however differences across the ba methods in variances across catchments were less pronounced than in variances across cms variance across catchments was generally a little smaller for signatures representing the water balance and runoff dynamics fig 10a and seasonal streamflows fig 10b than for the signatures representing low fig 10c and high flows fig 10d inconsistencies were particularly large in t minq30 for which the raw variance was even inflated by the copula and mbcn methods fig 10c second panel and in t maxq1 for which all methods except mbcn inflated the variance fig 10d second panel 4 1 4 consistency across hydroclimatic regimes given the variability in biases across catchments fig 11 we further assessed whether systematic differences in performance of ba methods in the northern catchments with dominantly snowmelt driven streamflow regimes located above latitude 60 n and southern primarily rainfall driven catchments located below 60 n could be detected in the northern catchments fig 11a d initial raw biases were consistently reduced with all ba methods in all 16 signatures notable were the high remaining biases and relatively low frequency of improvements for q winter fig 11b particularly with the univariate methods in contrast q summer fig 11b and t maxq1 fig 11d only had small biases remaining and featured a high rate of improvements in signatures representing the water balance and runoff dynamics fig 11a in the northern catchments distribution based methods resulted in slightly lower maes than distribution free methods the same behavior was detected for q spring and q autumn fig 11b for q summer however univariate methods outperformed the multivariate ones as opposed to q winter similarly both multivariate ba methods reduced biases in low flow signatures more than the univariate ones fig 11c except for t minq30 for which copula performed worse than the other three methods biases in high flow signatures were reduced most by the distribution based methods with the exception of maxq d1 for which copula resulted in the largest remaining bias fig 11d frequencies of improvement with the ba methods were largely consistent with the mae values i e lower remaining biases were accompanied with the highest rate of improvements the ba methods were generally able to reduce biases in the southern mainly rainfall driven catchments fig 11e h in most cases the distribution based ba methods outperformed distribution free ones both distribution based methods performed similarly i e ds and copula each performed best for half of the signatures on the other hand in the distribution free methods qdm outperformed mbcn in the majority of signatures 14 out of 16 for comt fig 11e t minq30 fig 11g and t maxq1 fig 11 h however the opposite pattern emerged i e the distribution free methods resulted in lower maes and a higher frequency of improvements compared to distribution based ones especially copula especially the copula method showed a low performance with remaining biases nearly as high as raw biases in comt or even higher in t minq30 and t maxq1 similarly to the northern catchments frequencies of improvement with the ba methods were consistent with the reduction in biases in other words a higher frequency of improvement was typically connected to lower maes 4 2 a comparison based evaluation based on the eight robustness criteria section 2 6 assessed in the previous sections we here fig 12 provide a comprehensive comparison of the ba methods aimed at identifying the most suitable method s for assessment of climate change impact on streamflow regime features represented by 16 signatures while application of each of the ba methods led to considerable improvements their overall performance varied for each criterion across signatures for example distribution based ba methods were generally more robust than the distribution free methods for signatures related to water balance and flow dynamics fig 12a as well as for seasonal flows fig 12b in both groups of signatures univariate ds frequently displayed a high performance across the criteria in 20 21 out of 32 cases and resulted in only 5 cases of low performance fig 12a b first panel closely followed by the multivariate copula approach with 18 20 high performance cases and 8 9 low performance cases fig 12a b third panel the multivariate variant of distribution free methods mbcn however performed worse than its univariate counterpart qdm with mbcn showing a low performance in 23 fig 12a fourth panel respective 22 fig 12b fourth panel cases whereas qdm ranked low only for 9 fig 12a third panel and 14 fig 12b third panel instances respectively remarkable was the robust performance of distribution based methods in reproducing signatures related to low flows fig 12c and high flows fig 12d these methods resulted in many more instances of high performance 14 each for ds and 18 21 for copula than the distribution free methods 9 12 cases for mbcn and 7 8 for qdm in the case of low flows fig 12c multivariate ba methods performed slightly better than their univariate counterparts i e copula performed better than ds and mbcn better than qdm for the signatures representing high flows fig 12d the application of multivariate methods resulted in a larger number of high performing instances compared to their univariate counterpart however the number of low performing cases also increased leaving fewer chances for medium performance across these methods the two multivariate methods namely copula fig 12d third panel and mbcn fig 12d fourth panel had only 2 and 5 medium performing cases while ds fig 12d first panel and qdm fig 12d second panel had as many as 11 and 15 of such cases respectively averaging the performance over the signatures within each signature group fig 12e revealed that the distribution based methods yielded similar performances that were better than those of the distribution free methods as indicated by their lower maes criterion 1 and higher frequencies of improvements criterion 2 while the distribution based methods also showed higher consistency across cms criterion 3 they came with slightly lower consistency across catchments criterion 4 generally there were slight differences between univariate and multivariate methods which were often overshadowed by the strong differences between distribution free and distribution based methods noticeable differences between uni and multivariate methods only emerged for the snowmelt driven catchments located above 60 n where advanced multivariate methods resulted in frequently better performance compared to their univariate counterparts criteria 5 6 nonetheless distribution based methods resulted in better performance compared to distribution free methods in the rainfall driven catchments located below 60 n the differences were again rather found between distribution based and distribution free methods criteria 7 8 where the former performed similar to each other and better than the latter with low performance of the advanced mbcn method across all four categories of signatures 5 discussion 5 1 performance and similarity of ba methods our results indicated that in the studied swedish catchments the hbv light model driven by uncorrected cm outputs i e precipitation and temperature resulted in substantial biases in all hydrological signatures representing 1 water balance and flow dynamics 2 seasonal flows 3 low flows and 4 high flows the magnitude of these biases varied across signatures cms catchments and their hydroclimatic regimes it is difficult to isolate signatures with the largest biases since they all have different units they take values that differ in orders of magnitude e g signatures related to timings can take value up to 366 as opposed to runoff coefficient which is 1 which also hinders comparisons across the signatures nevertheless all signatures obtained with raw cm outputs have in common great raw biases that can exceed the reference values by several times which brings informativeness and potential applicability of such signatures into question variations in biases across the cms did not exhibit any distinct behavior i e no cm consistently resulted in the highest lowest biases across signatures but certain patterns across catchments i e their hydroclimatic regions could be detected for example seven signatures related to seasonal and extreme flows showed clear spatial patterns among them were the 1 day and 30 day high flows as well as spring and summer flows which demonstrated higher systematic errors in northern snowfall dominated catchments located above 60 n in the et or dfb climate zones winter flows timing of 1 day high flow and spring pulse day featured the opposite pattern by having larger biases in the southern catchments below latitude 60 n in the dfc climate zone this behavior can be a consequence of different dominating hydrological regimes specifically regimes in northern sweden are generally snowmelt driven resulting in a pronounced flow seasonality with low flows during winters due to snow accumulation and a flood peak that typically occurs over springs and summers arheimer and lindström 2015 matti et al 2017 teutschbein et al 2022 teutschbein et al 2015 there are thus higher absolute flows in the north over spring and summer which consequently result in larger biases expressed in absolute terms in this study in contrast flows in southern sweden are generally rainfall driven matti et al 2017 and are affected by higher evaporative demands in the summer as a consequence there are generally lower flows in the summer and higher flows in winter in this region implying also higher biases in absolute terms in winter flows as demonstrated by our results section 3 1 1 2 larger biases in timings of annual maxima in these catchments can be attributed to spatiotemporal variability of extreme precipitation barlow et al 2019 that affects the timing of rainfall driven flow peaks which also results in less pronounced flow seasonality i e flatter intra annual flow distribution than in the northern catchments with snowmelt driven regimes biases in the other nine signatures did not show distinct spatial patterns generally the detected biases in hydrological signatures obtained with the raw cm outputs can be attributed to simplified representations of e g atmospheric convection lucas picher et al 2021 aerosol behavior huang and ding 2021 or humidity bastin et al 2019 in cms which are then translated into simulated streamflows through the impact modelling chain brunner and slater 2022 chen et al 2021b dobler et al 2012 teutschbein and seibert 2012 biases in simulated streamflows or hydrolgic signatures stemming from these simplifications cannot be expected to get alleviated with the application of the latest generation of cms i e cmip6 since there is no evidence for their superiority in representing different characteristics of climatic variables over the previous cm versions bourdeau goulet and hassanzadeh 2021 seneviratne and hauser 2020 application of bias adjustment methods has been debated over the past decade e g chen et al 2021b ehret et al 2012 some studies indicated that ba methods can potentially impair spatiotemporal characteristics of the cm outputs ehret et al 2012 whereas some studies clearly demonstrated their merits in minimizing overall uncertainty associated with hydrological simulations muerth et al 2013 teutschbein and seibert 2013 velázquez et al 2013 including even field scale agricultural impact studies glotter et al 2014 laux et al 2021 this paper corroborates conclusions presented in both groups of studies and specifically shows that application of ba methods can considerably modify simulated signals by raw cms our results also demonstrated that the application of ba methods in the vast majority of cases substantially decreases biases in the simulated hydrological signatures in the scandinavian catchments regardless of their hydroclimatic or geomorphological characteristics considering that cm induced biases can adversely affect results of the hydrological impact studies and hence hinder identification of adequate climate change adaptation strategies the results of our study support common practice which implies bias adjustment of simulated climate variables to be an integral part of impact studies dobler et al 2012 hakala et al 2019 teutschbein and seibert 2012 the four ba methods used in this study can be either categorized by the number of variables simultaneously being adjusted i e uni versus multivariate or by their underlying approach to map the distributions quantiles i e distribution free versus distribution based ds and copula both rely on the distribution based ds method for adjustment of univariate marginal biases in precipitation and temperature while qdm and mbcn share the distribution free qdm method for adjustment of univariate characteristics therefore by construction the performance of each pair of methods was similar in reducing biases in univariate characteristics of precipitation and temperature which are drivers of hydrological modeling tootoonchi et al 2022a our study revealed strong correlations in the remaining biases in simulated hydrological signatures obtained with the ba methods the strongest and most frequent correlations in this study were obtained between qdm and mbcn this demonstrates that the additional adjustment of the quite weak precipitation temperature dependence which is conducted with mbcn does not affect the similarities between these two distribution free methods since mbcn does not rely on heavy stationarity assumptions for dependence or temporal sequencing of climate models cannon 2016 such strong correlations between qdm and mbcn could be explained by the fact that the distribution free methods do not require identification of appropriate distribution functions at any step as opposed to the ds and copula methods that exhibited strong correlations less frequently this can be seen as a great flexibility in selecting a distribution free ba method which is relevant for future impact studies berg et al 2022 gudmundsson et al 2012 strong correlations were also found between the residual biases of ds and copula in many signatures the largest discrepancies between these two ba methods emerged in seasonal streamflows these results can indicate that seasonality of simulated streamflows is affected by accuracy in bias adjustment of precipitation temperature dependence which is a multivariate feature that is better adjusted with copula than with univariate ds tootoonchi et al 2022a correlations of residual biases obtained with distribution based and distribution free ba methods to raw biases were largely similar but low however the weakest correlations in this regard were obtained with the copula method e g winter flows or timing of annual minima section 3 1 1 the copula method includes a shuffling algorithm vrac 2018 that is typically stationary and based on the reference precipitation signal françois et al 2020 thus the original signal of the raw cm simulations is completely lost for precipitation and temperature which further reflects on simulated streamflow and hydrological signatures this might also explain some of the differences between ds and the copula approach to overcome this issue vrac thao 2020 recently introduced a flexible shuffling algorithm that takes different shuffling options into consideration they however also highlighted that in the context of impact studies further evaluations are needed to find optimal temporal reference characteristics at different locations rather strong correlations between qdm and mbcn together with the fact that qdm slightly outperformed its multivariate counterpart in most instances in this study point to a conclusion that the added complexity and computation time needed to implement the multivariate mbcn method might not necessarily provide added value over qdm in simulating hydrological signatures interestingly previous research on the robustness of the ba methods in nordic catchments pinpointed mbcn as a rather robust method when it comes to bias adjustment of various including multivariate features of precipitation and temperature series tootoonchi et al 2022a however results presented in this study indicated that adding a hydrological model to the modeling chain can suppress benefits gained with a particular ba method in this case mbcn in other words nonlinearity of the hydrological models beven 2012 which is inevitable to describe the highly nonlinear nature of catchment responses todini 1996 can completely overturn conclusions on the robustness of ba methods based on their performance in reproducing features of precipitation and temperature series alone regardless of how thorough and exhaustive those evaluations are we thus argue that the adjustment of the dependence between precipitation and temperature might come with the cost of hampering the accurate representation of the temporal features of these series for which the resulting impacted variable here streamflows and hydrological signatures might pay the price more specifically the copula method significantly distorts temporal characteristics of the climatic variables tootoonchi et al 2022a which affected the resulting streamflow simulations in other words multivariate ba methods do correct the dependencies between climatic variables but this does not necessarily translate into the streamflow simulations our results clearly suggest that evaluations of the ability of ba methods in reproducing climatic variables are simply not sufficient to justify their selection for a hydrological impact study at hand in nordic catchments thus examination of ba methods based on impact variables that integrate the climatic variables are crucial and we recommend further assessments of hydrological signatures in other catchments with various physiographic characteristics and hydroclimatic regimes 5 2 robustness of ba methods previous studies e g françois et al 2020 tootoonchi et al 2022a showed merits of multivariate ba methods for adjusting multiple features of cm outputs in term of hydrological simulations however the consequences of applying intricate ba methods varied across different studies and in different regions some studies demonstrated superior performance of the multivariate ba methods in specific regions singh and najafi 2020 or in reproducing specific components of runoff meyer et al 2019 other studies detected modest performance of the multivariate ba methods that led to deteriorations in the hydrological simulations van de velde et al 2022 or found no substantial difference between the performance of uni and multivariate ba methods guo et al 2020 räty et al 2018 however many of these studies analyzed only performance measures like nash sutcliffe nash and sutcliffe 1970 which could provide only limited information on the complex role of ba methods in streamflow simulations thus to provide deeper and more detailed insights into the effects of ba methods on hydrological modeling results we here used a suite of 16 hydrological signatures that described various streamflow characteristics which in turn represent an integration of the temporal and bivariate aspects of precipitation and temperature at the catchment scale hakala et al 2018 our evaluation in this study was tailored to accommodate concepts of accuracy and precision which were here applied to bias adjusted model simulations as elaborated in section 2 6 accuracy was represented by low average biases and high frequency of improvement in comparison to raw cm outputs while precision was represented by low values of variance across cms and catchments based on our holistic evaluation of performance of the ba methods in all 50 swedish catchments we found no considerable differences between the accuracy of uni and multivariate ba methods the multivariate methods performed similarly to their univariate counterparts both in reducing biases and in the frequency of improvement the only noticeable difference was the higher frequency of improvement by multivariate methods in winter flows compared to the univariate ones larger dissimilarities were however detected between distribution based and distribution free methods distribution based methods consistently resulted in lower maes and higher frequency of improvement except for the signatures representing temporal aspects i e comt or timing of minimum and maximum flows this might be attributed to their poorer performance in reproducing temporal features of climate variables i e cross copula and autocorrelation ds in the precipitation and temperature series tootoonchi et al 2022a these features might result in an improperly reproduced chronology in these series which reflects in timings of simulated streamflow series and consequently in these signatures robust ba methods are expected to consistently reduce biases in simulated streamflows and hydrological signatures i e to demonstrate high precision by yielding low variability in biases across signatures cms or catchments including different hydroclimatic regimes teutschbein and seibert 2012 application of all four ba methods generally reduced the variability in biases across both cms and catchments in comparison to raw biases the distribution based methods showed lower variability across cms meaning that distribution based methods especially copula are less sensitive to the selection of cms the lowest variability was obtained with copula which almost cancelled out any variability across cms in many signatures although this can be considered to be an appealing property of the copula method it also gives rise to concerns that in this way signals in raw cm outputs are completely concealed which might result in loss of information offered by cms cannon 2018 maraun 2016 on the contrary copula had the highest variability across catchments while the distribution free ba methods generally showed lower variability this in turn suggests that the performance of distribution free approaches in reproducing hydrological signatures is less sensitive to hydroclimatic or other properties of catchments this outcome was further confirmed by dividing the catchments into two distinct groups that represent snowmelt driven northern and rainfall driven southern streamflow regimes indeed distribution based methods in the southern catchments performed poorly in reducing biases in timing related signatures and even inflated the biases in timing of 1 day annual maxima in general the exact timing of extreme precipitation is typically not accurately captured in cm simulations lind et al 2020 this can impair the predictably of extreme streamflows in southern catchments where floods are mainly generated by heavy and or prolonged rainfall events in contrast high flows in the northern catchments are better simulated by the modelling chain as they mostly depend on the snow accumulation over a period of several months during which the exact timing of precipitation events is of less importance we here found that catchments with typically thin snowpacks located in the southwest of sweden are at particular risk of large biases in the timing of flood peaks mostly because slight melting might entirely diminish the snowpack in these catchments which then causes the flood peaks to become entirely rainfall dependent and to potentially shift to a different season the separate evaluation of the ba methods in the northern and southern catchments also shed light on the added value of application of the multivariate methods for example the multivariate methods were superior in the cold winter season in representation of all signatures depicting low flows in the northern snowmelt driven catchments apparently in these snowmelt driven environments the dependence between precipitation and temperature distinguishes between liquid precipitation and snow meyer et al 2019 and snowmelt timing defines runoff generation which consequently influences the seasonal cycle of streamflow therefore multivariate bias adjustment methods such as copula and mbcn both of which perform quite well in reproducing the dependence between precipitation and temperature tootoonchi et al 2022a also shine in the reproduction of low flow signatures in these regions with global warming causing shorter snow duration less snow accumulation on the ground and earlier snowmelt onset addor et al 2014 coppola et al 2018 klein et al 2016 ye and cohen 2013 the magnitude of high flows are expected to drastically decrease hakala et al 2020 resulting in lower streamflows after a normal snowmelt period and causing so called warm snow season droughts van loon and van lanen 2012 such changes may have considerable negative impacts on the environment e g by jeopardizing aquatic life and impeding sediment transport northern sweden perers et al 2007 also hosts many hydropower plants which require reliable operational low flow forecasts at both short and long time scales for their optimal functionality abgottspon and andersson 2016 boucher and ramos 2018 or assessment of required environmental flows gain et al 2013 shifting hydrological regimes require adaptation of farming practices to mitigate risks of loss in crops cervantes godoy et al 2014 thus even slight improvements in accuracy of low flow forecasts and or projections by applying the multivariate ba methods may prevent considerable ecological and financial losses in these regions for riparian studies that analyze 30 day annual maxima which are essential for assessment of riparian forest patch persistence distribution based ba methods were proven superior in this study in rainfall driven southern catchments multivariate methods did not demonstrate any distinct superiority in performance the univariate ds method even outperformed other three methods closely followed by copula therefore greater reduction in biases in the south was obtained by ba methods that adjust well univariate and temporal features of precipitation tootoonchi et al 2022a good performance was obtained in reproducing annual maxima and minima of different durations in these catchments these results suggest that application of distribution based methods is preferred for studies aimed at e g flood hazard or flood risk assessment or design of water intakes and estimation of environmental flows although not directly tested in their study this outcome was already suspected by zscheischler et al 2019 who argued that in cases of 1 two climate variables not being strongly correlated or 2 the process of interest e g rainfall driven floods being predominantly dependent on one climate variable the impact of adjusting dependence might be of less importance compared to the proper representation of the most influential climate variable therefore analyzing the dependence between the contributing hydrometeorological variables at the relevant spatiotemporal scale might be crucial and time saving tootoonchi et al 2022b if there is little to no evidence of dependent behaviour application of rather intricate multivariate methods might not add any significant value 5 3 a comparison based evaluation while there was not a single method that exceled according to all eight evaluation criteria the application of any ba method generally improved streamflow simulations by reducing systematic errors and increasing consistency in performance across cms and catchments these results emphasize the need for bias adjustment as an essential step that should be taken prior to any hydrological modeling exercise to ensure long term sustainability of water resources management the choice of an appropriate ba method is however not straightforward and it depends on the study location data computation resources as well as water management issue and related research question at hand concerning the two univariate methods ds and qdm distribution based ds generally outperformed distribution free qdm except for the timings of high flows and low flows between the two multivariate methods copula resulted in considerably better performance than mbcn more specifically in rainfall driven catchments mbcn performed poorly across all four categories of signatures nonetheless both multivariate methods resulted in better performance in low flows in snowmelt driven catchments mbcn outperformed copula in all four signatures within this category and generally showed a higher skill in adjusting signatures depicting timing of flows overall the two distribution based methods performed rather similarly and outperformed distribution free methods in rainfall driven catchments simple univariate ds even resulted in slightly better performance in the signatures that represent water balance and flow dynamics as well as seasonal flow whereas copula demonstrated its merits in reproducing signatures related to low and high flows this behavior was also consistent between the two distribution free ba methods where simple applications such as those for reproducing annual or seasonal flows were adjusted adequately with univariate qdm while extreme flows benefited from the application of more complex mbcn method as discussed is section 4 1 although evaluation of the ba methods clearly revealed robustness of mbcn in reproducing various features of precipitation and temperature series tootoonchi et al 2022a when applied within the entire modeling chain that includes also hydrological models this robustness fades out nevertheless it should be noted that multivariate methods that account for dependence between precipitation and temperature might be crucial for assessing compound extreme events aghakouchak et al 2014 brunner et al 2019a teutschbein et al 2023 6 concluding remarks this study evaluated the ability of four bias adjustment methods to reproduce various features of hydrologic regimes in a 42 year long record period 1962 2004 in 50 swedish catchments to this end the bias adjustment methods were applied within the ensemble of modelling chains comprising ten climate models and the hbv light hydrological model special emphases in the evaluation were placed on the differences and similarities among these methods research question 1 the results elucidate that the application of ba methods is crucial and still an essential step for hydroclimatic impact studies and that simulation outputs specifically hydrological signatures for water resources management planning strongly depend on the selection of a specific method however no method was proven superior for all signatures and according to all evaluation criteria considered in this study additionally the robustness of the ba methods across climate models catchments and hydroclimatic regimes was assessed to provide deep insights into different aspect of ba performance research question 2 we here demonstrated robust performance of distribution based methods across cms indicating that they are less sensitive to the selection of climate models with different boundary conditions and process representations than distribution base approaches all ba methods were highly sensitive to the selection of catchments which emphasizes the need to incorporate process understanding to the bias adjustment step to provide bias adjusted and simultaneously physically meaningful data for hydrological impact studies in different parts of the world however these results remain to be confirmed for other study areas with different hydroclimatic conditions and streamflow regimes finally in this study we sought to identify the most suitable ba method s for the simulation of hydrological signatures relevant for water resources management under changing climate in the nordic regions research question 3 to conclude in most cases the simple and straightforward univariate distribution scaling method is the best choice as it has the highest potential to robustly reduce biases across a variety of signatures application of the multivariate methods copula or mbcn might be worth the additional efforts only in snowmelt driven catchments or for particular purposes that require correct timing of high or low flows in these cases however one should be aware that these multivariate methods might add further uncertainties due to various assumptions for adjustment of dependence between precipitation and temperature and consequent modifications of temporal characteristics credit authorship contribution statement faranak tootoonchi conceptualization
