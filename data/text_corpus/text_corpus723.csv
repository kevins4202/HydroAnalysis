3615,hydrothermal activity and seismicity are abundant along the yushu ganzi xianshuihe fault system ygxfs in the eastern tibetan plateau however the processes and factors that control hydrothermal fluid circulation at a regional scale remain less constrained and the relationship between geothermal anomaly and seismic activity is poorly known in this study we report an integrated dataset of thermal water chemistry δ18oh2o δdh2o and δ13c of dissolved inorganic carbon dic to identify the origin circulation path and reservoir properties of hydrothermal fluids and then reveal the relationship between fluid circulation and seismic activity the thermal waters are mainly classified as na hco3 type with minor ca na hco3 and na hco3 cl types the δ18oh2o 18 7 to 14 5 and δdh2o 142 to 110 values indicate recharge of meteoric waters which infiltrated along the ygxfs to 2 6 km depths and underwent mixing with deep fluids prior to their discharge at the surface a mass balance model based on δ13cdic values 4 3 to 5 9 and dic contents of thermal waters reveals the involvement of co2 bearing fluids from mantle and thermo metamorphic decarbonation of crustal marine limestones in tectonic co2 outgassing from the active fault the estimated reservoir temperatures 85 336 c based on silica geothermometer of the thermal waters decrease from southeast to northwest along the ygxfs notably the epicenters of strong earthquakes ms 6 are mostly located in the transition zone of geothermal anomalies according to spatial distribution of the reservoir temperatures combined with geological and geophysical information we suggest that the heterogeneity of crustal thermal structure and the upwelling of deep fluids may play an essential role in the distribution of thermal springs and the high frequency of earthquakes along the ygxfs keywords geothermal waters hydrochemistry stable isotope geothermometry yushu ganzi xianshuihe fault system eastern tibetan plateau 1 introduction as the surface expressions of energy released from earth s interior hydrothermal and seismic activities are closely correlated in active fault zones wang et al 2019a and references therein it is widely observed in extensional compressional and strike slip tectonic settings that seismically active fault zones provide conduits for upwelling of hydrothermal fluids chiodini et al 2020 and references therein previous seismic tomography results have revealed the cluster distribution of earthquakes around the zones that have anomalies of low seismic velocity kato et al 2013 okada et al 2015 lei and zhao 2016 or thermal anomalies associated with magma intrusions and or storage of deep fluids zhao et al 2010 at crustal and mantle depths these studies also have illustrated that the deeply circulated hydrothermal fluids within active fault zones can lead to weakening of seismogenic layers and thus facilitate nucleation of earthquakes terakawa et al 2010 kato et al 2013 okada et al 2015 diamond et al 2018 coppola et al 2021 on the other hand seismic activities can also cause changes of various physico chemical properties of crustal fluids nakagawa et al 2020 gori and barberio 2022 a series of earthquake related changes in hydrologic conditions elemental and isotopic compositions of groundwaters discharged from active faults have been regarded as important indexes for earthquake forecasting e g skelton et al 2014 li et al 2019a li et al 2019b hosono et al 2020 nakagawa et al 2020 yan et al 2021 franchini et al 2021 the circulation depth reservoir temperature and geochemistry of hydrothermal fluids are affected by fault structures involved in earthquake nucleation over variable spatial scales including microscale fractures in dilated rocks of individual fault and kilometer scale fault displacements across the lithosphere scott et al 2020 this provides a physico chemical basis for exploring the possible relationships between geothermal anomalies fluid geochemistry and seismic activities along the active faults the tibetan himalayan orogenic belt as a result of the collision between the indian and eurasian continents is one of the largest focal zones of geothermal anomalies and seismic activities on earth hubbard and shaw 2009 tang et al 2017a tang et al 2017b in particular there are 248 thermal springs distributed along active fault zones in the eastern tibetan plateau among these active faults the yushu ganzi xianshuihe fault system ygxfs fig 1 is an important strike slip boundary fault in the eastern tibetan plateau along which high compressive stresses and clusters of thermal springs are observed zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021b at least sixteen ms 6 earthquakes have occurred along the ygxfs since 1700 allen et al 1991 with recent strong earthquakes hitting its northwestern segment in 2010 i e mw 7 1 yushu earthquake and its southeastern segment in 2014 i e mw 6 3 kangding earthquake yan and lin 2015 thus the ygxfs has long been regarded as the target area of earthquake hazard prevention it is noted that previous studies mainly focused on the geochemistry of hydrothermal fluids at single or limited localities of thermal springs along the ygxfs fan et al 2019 guo et al 2017 li et al 2018 li et al 2020 the genetic links between geothermal anomalies and regional seismicity are less understood therefore a detailed geochemical study on hydrothermal fluids discharging from this fault system would contribute to a better understanding of the relationships between hydrochemical processes geothermal reservoirs and seismic activities in this study we present new data of physico chemical parameters hydrochemical and isotopic compositions δ18oh2o δdh2o and δ13cdic of hydrothermal fluids from 24 localities along a 500 km long segment of the ygxfs 70 of its total length our data combined with literature data provide a good opportunity for understanding the relationship between fluid geochemistry and seismicity distribution along the ygxfs the goals of this study are i to classify the types of thermal waters and evaluate related controlling factors ii to constrain the fluid origin and hydrothermal processes such as fluid mixing and water rock interaction and iii to estimate reservoir temperatures and explore the genetic links between lithospheric thermal structure and regional earthquake distribution 2 geological setting 2 1 yushu ganzi xianshuihe fault system the large active faults in the tibetan plateau result from the continental collision of the indian and eurasian plates which are converging at a relative rate of 40 50 mm yr zhang et al 2004 the northward subduction of the indian plate beneath the eurasian plate generates e w and nw se trending large left lateral strike slip fault system including the kunlun and ygxfs fig 1a wei et al 2017 these faults collectively accommodate the shortening of tibetan crust during india eurasia collision gao et al 2019 extending 800 km from the interior of the tibetan plateau to its southeastern margin along a ne trending arcuate structure yan and lin 2015 the ygxfs experienced large scale left lateral slip at a rate of approximately 4 6 12 mm yr and is one of the major active fault systems in tibetan plateau fig 1a spatially this active fault system consists of the yushu ganzi fault system ygfs in the northwest and the xianshuihe fault system xfs in the southeast fig 1b forming an important geological and geophysical boundary between the songpan ganzi block sgb and the sichuan yunnan block syb the ygfs extends 500 km from qinghai province in the northwest to sichuan province in the southeast with a dipping angle of 70 85 to ne and a width of 50 100 m in the triassic sedimentary rocks li et al 2013 these sedimentary rocks are widely exposed throughout the sgb mainly composed of feldspathic sandstones quartzose sandstones siltstones and silty slates the extensive outcrops of the triassic arc related calc alkaline igneous rocks clastics and carbonates in the southeast of the fault are locally intruded by meso cenozoic plutons the sinistral strike slip movement of ygfs resulted in striking relics in the landscape forming a series of quaternary strike slip structures and narrow small pull apart basins such as ganzi dengke and jielong li et al 2013 the 370 km long xfs is a curved ne trending strike slip fault and is the boundary between syb and sgb triassic flysch associations that consist of deformed and metamorphic feldspar quartz sandstones tuffaceous sandstones siltstones and mudstones are exposed widely on both sides of the xfs tang et al 2017a the outcropped precambrian and paleozoic rocks in the east of xfs include epi metamorphic sandstones slates limestone lenses limestones and metamorphic quartz sandstones wang et al 1998 wang et al 2019 triassic strata near the xfs are intruded by multi stages of granitoid including pre mesozoic granites triassic granites and jurassic granitic rocks the gonggan granites and zheduo granites with ages of 12 18 ma li and zhang 2013 and 13 4 ma tang et al 2017a are distributed along the xfs suggesting that magmatism and strike slip movement of the xfs may be synchronous near the shimian county to the southeast the xfs branches into the anninghe and daliangshan fault system wang et al 1998 yan and lin 2015 2 2

exposed in the ganzi pull apart basin and distributed along the ygfs and present in carbonate rocks and quartz sandstones in triassic strata or the fissure of intrusive rocks of different ages the studied geothermal wells and thermal springs have discharge temperatures of 74 6 c at gga and 28 4 58 2 c at dghwz along the ygfs respectively these thermal waters have a flow rate of 0 04 to 58 50 l

from na k k mg na k ca and sio2 geothermometers for thermal springs are given in table 3 4 results 4 1 physico chemical parameters the thermal spring waters of the xfs are sub acidic to neutral ph 6 2 7 4 and have ec values of 522 2430 μs cm and water temperatures of 18 76 c table 1 the highest temperature 76 c was measured in guanding spring gd fig 2a of the kyga located at the intersection of the yalahe fault and sela fault in ygfs water temperatures 28 75 c ph 6 3 7 7 and ec 230 2580 μs cm observed in the geothermal waters are similar to those previously reported by fan et al 2019 the discharge temperatures of thermal springs display a decreasing trend towards the nw along the xfs and ygfs segments of the active fault system 4 2 hydrochemical characteristics major ions composition of thermal waters shows that most of the thermal springs along the ygxfs are na hco3 type waters and a few thermal springs along the xfs are mainly ca na hco3 type fig 3 a all surficial waters are ca mg hco3 type in the cl so4 hco3 diagram fig 3b giggenbach 1988 all the spring waters along the ygxfs fall into the peripheral bicarbonate water field with a linear evolutionary trend toward the hco3 corner some thermal waters from geothermal wells at the kyga contain an elevated sulfate concentration and belong to the group of mature water the pco2 values of thermal springs along the xfs and ygfs range from 0 0195 to 0 7586 atm and 0 0033 to 0 5623 atm respectively much higher than the atmospheric value 0 0003 atm table 2 except for a few samples 6 18 mg l most thermal springs along the ygxfs are characterized by high na contents 68 564 mg l table 2 consistent with the previously published na range of 86 861 in thermal spring waters fig 4 a and table s1 most samples have low contents of k 1 62 mg l ca2 17 138 mg l and mg2 3 71 mg l contents fig 4b d hco3 149 to 1791 mg l table 2 is the dominant anion in all thermal waters of the study area fig 4e the co3 2 contents in most thermal waters from ygxfs are not detectable except for samples with high ph values reported in the literature table s1 the so4 2 contents in ygfs 2 5 117 mg l samples are commonly higher than that in xfs 4 6 97 mg l fig 4f the cl contents 40 272 mg l of the kyga thermal springs along the xfs are higher than thermal waters 1 44 mg l along the ygfs fig 4 compared to thermal springs geothermal well waters from kyga have higher contents of na 617 973 mg l k 81 134 mg l and cl 545 760 mg l table s1 but lower ca2 1 9 39 mg l mg2 0 1 5 5 mg l and so4 2 contents 0 1 27 mg l except one shallow geothermal well sample the chemical composition of surficial water samples is mainly dominated by ca2 13 57 mg l and hco3 31 332 mg l table 2 and s1 the dissolved sio2 contents of thermal spring samples along the ygxfs have a range of 9 191 mg l table 2 one order of magnitude higher than surface water samples 2 10 mg l generally low temperature spring waters tend to have lower sio2 concentrations 9 21 mg l that are close to surface water 4 3 isotopic compositions the δ18o and δ d values of thermal spring waters along the ygxfs range from 18 7 to 14 5 and 142 to 110 respectively table 2 values of δ18o and δd for surface waters range from 15 9 to 14 1 and 119 to 106 respectively the surficial water samples are isotopically more enriched in deuterium compared to the thermal waters along the ygxfs the δ13cdic values of thermal waters range from 4 3 to 2 1 except for two thermal springs with values of 4 2 jy and 5 9 mn compared with thermal spring waters the surficial waters have lower δ13cdic values of 4 4 to 2 5 all samples have δ13cdic higher than that of atmospheric co2 7 mook 1986 magmatic co2 6 5 2 5 sano and marty 1995 as well as plant derived co2 in soil 22 to 34 for c3 plant and 9 to 16 for c4 plant robinson and scrimgeour 1995 the δ13cdic values in most thermal waters are close to the value of marine carbonate rocks 0 3 newell et al 2008 5 discussion 5 1 origin of thermal waters in geothermal systems oxygen and hydrogen isotopes are widely used to determine the origin of thermal waters secondary processes and water rock interaction d amore and panichi 1985 xu et al 2022 as shown in the δd vs δ18o diagram fig 5 most of the thermal springs and surface waters along the ygxfs are located along the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 and local meteoric water line lmwl wu 2009 in chengdu of sichuan province indicating the meteoric origin note that some samples from geothermal springs and wells at gga and kyga have a slight δ18o shift fig 5 it might be attributed to water rock interaction in a high temperature geothermal system such isotopic shift depends on reservoir temperature mineralogy and permeability of the rocks and duration time of water rock reaction karakuş et al 2019 and references therein the extent of positive 18o shift observed in the kyga and gga samples is within 4 fig 5 table 2 and s1 resulting from the 18o exchange between thermal fluids and oxygen bearing minerals in the geothermal reservoir topographically there are 45 mountains with elevations 6000 m above sea level asl around the ygxfs including the 6168 m high mt queer manigange area 7556 m high mt gongga south of kangding area and mt zhuodana southern ganzi with a snow capped peak at 5200 m asl the recharged waters along the ygxfs are composed of local meteoric water including snow and glacier meltwater and connate groundwater derived from the surrounding mountains 5 2 water rock interaction chemical compositions of hydrothermal fluids are strongly affected by the water rock interaction processes in aquifer systems through chemical reactions such as the dissolution and precipitation of minerals e g carbonate silicate halite and sulfate from country rocks or near surface sediments oxidation reduction reaction and ion exchange reaction negri et al 2018 mukherjee and singh 2018 2020 the carbonic acid is formed by the dissolution of ascending co2 from crust and mantle degassing eq 1 along the fault zone into shallow groundwaters in these geothermal areas fan et al 2019 xu et al 2022 carbonic acid is a weak acid and easily converted to hco3 in the water eq 2 mukherjee and singh 2018 the concentrations of na and k in geothermal waters are controlled by the dissolution of silicates rocks such as pyroxene albite and na feldspar eq 3 the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 by carbonate minerals mainly calcite limestone dolomite and magnesite eq 4 5 silicate minerals such as plagioclase feldspar eq 4 and sulfides evaporites gypsum and so4 2 by alunite or gypsum eq 6 thus the variations between major cations e g na ca2 and mg2 and anions e g hco3 cl and so4 2 could be used to discriminate the water rock interaction processes that have affected the water chemistry of the ygxfs fig 6 major chemical reactions involved in the water rock interaction of the aquifer system are shown as follows c o 2 h 2 o h 2 c o 3 1 2 h 2 c o 3 h c o 3 h n a a l s i 3 o 8 a l b i t e c o 2 2 h 2 o n a 3 s i o 2 a l o h 3 h c o 3 3 c a c o 3 c a l c i t e c o 2 h 2 o c a 2 2 h c o 3 4 c a m g c o 3 2 d o l o m i t e 2 c o 2 2 h 2 o c a 2 m g 2 4 h c o 3 5 c a s o 4 2 h 2 o g y p s u m c a 2 s o 4 2 2 h 2 o 6 the dissolution of silicate minerals e g albite in carbonated aquifers can produce na and hco3 in the groundwater fig 6a in addition to silicate dissolution the dissolution of calcite dolomite and gypsum would lead to enrichments in ca2 mg2 hco3 and so4 2 fig 6b d and dissolution of halite contributes to the elevated na k and cl in groundwater fig 6e mukherjee and singh 2022 the mineral dissolution reactions together with ion exchange reactions fig 6f are generally responsible for the charge balance between cations and anions for the aquifer system in na vs hco3 diagram except for some samples from geothermal well most thermal spring waters along the ygxfs are plotted on and or below the 1 1 line fig 6a the line reflects the ideal mole ratio between na and hco3 in the case of equilibrium state of silicate e g albite dissolution in carbonic acid fluids this suggests the effects of silicate dissolution and is supported by the na excess relative to cl fig 6e most thermal springs along the ygxfs are na hco3 type waters and are slightly acidic to neutral ph 6 2 7 4 table 1 the na hco3 type waters are commonly associated with dissolution of silicate minerals e g albite fig 6a in carbonic acid aquifers aydin et al 2020 this is consistent with the observation that thermal springs in the study area are mainly exposed to silicate country rocks e g granitic masses and triassic sedimentary rocks the silicate dissolution is also reflected by the plot of hco3 so4 vs ca mg fig 6d if these ions are sorely derived from dissolution of calcite dolomite and gypsum the equivalent ratio of hco3 so4 ca mg should approach 1 1 however most thermal waters plot in the upper field of the 1 1 line fig 6d the excess hco3 so4 may originate from deeper sources e g deep fluids in addition to dissolution of minerals at the shallow aquifer depths kagoshima et al 2015 zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021b in this case na derived from dissolution of silicate minerals is required to maintain charge balance between anions and cations fisher and mullican 1997 the high ca so4 ratios 1 fig 6c can be attributed to i carbonate dissolution that accounts for ca2 excess relative to so4 2 and or ii the decrease in so4 2 content due to sulfate reduction the ca na hco3 types of some thermal waters at kyga could represent a mixture of na hco3 type dissolution of silicate rocks and ca hco3 type dissolution of carbonate rocks waters the effect of ion exchange reaction on anion concentrations was evaluated by the plot of ca mg so4 hco3 vs na k cl fig 6f it is noted that most samples along the ygxfs are close to the 1 1 line indicating the major cation participate in the ion exchange reaction in addition the thermal waters along the ygxfs are generally enriched in na with respect to cl fig 6e na and cl in fluid are commonly attributed to the dissolution of halite however no evaporite units are found in the study area that can contribute na and cl into thermal waters the cl enrichment in geothermal well waters was likely inherited from high temperature geothermal reservoirs where the host rock minerals are equilibrated with deep fluids that are enriched in cl giggenbach 1991 the mixing between groundwaters and deep fluids could explain the presence of na cl hco3 type waters at kyga a striking feature of the studied thermal springs along the ygxfs is that almost all the samples have lower ca mg hco3 ratios relative to the 1 1 line fig 6b this observation together with the ca derived from gypsum dissolution fig 6c and high hco3 so4 ca mg ratios 1 fig 6d unambitiously point to a significant hco3 enrichment in the thermal waters this is consistent with pco2 and ph values of the studied thermal springs for outflowing groundwater in active fault zones the dissolution and contents of dic are associated with pco2 and ph values macpherson et al 2008 as shown in table 2 the pco2 values of thermal spring waters from the ygxfs are remarkably higher than the atmospheric pco2 level suggesting strong co2 degassing at the surface as observed in the field fig 2 5 3 origin of dissolved carbon in groundwaters possible sources of carbon dissolved in groundwaters include atmospheric co2 dissolved by meteoric water catm soil co2 of organic origin corg dissolution of carbonate minerals ccarb and endogenic co2 cendo produced by magmatic and or metamorphic degassing chiodini et al 2000 2004 these carbon sources contribute to the total dic h2co3 hco3 and co3 2 in the thermal waters the atmospheric co2 with an average δ13c value of 7 usually has a negligible contribution to total dic in recharged water due to remarkably low atmospheric pco2 value 0 0003 atm karakuş et al 2019 as such the δ13cdic of recharged water is dominated by soil co2 e g δ13c 22 to 34 robinson and scrimgeour 1995 the co2 derived from dissolution of carbonate minerals in the shallow aquifer system δ13c 0 3 newell et al 2008 and deeply sourced carbon including magmatic co2 δ13c 6 5 2 5 sano and marty 1995 and metamorphic co2 of various source rocks δ13c 30 to 0 newell et al 2008 a mass balance model based on water chemistry and δ13cdic values chiodini et al 2000 2004 was used to constrain the origin of carbon dissolved in thermal spring waters it should be noted that this model requires the equilibrium in carbon isotope fractionation during co2 degassing and or calcite precipitation for this study these uncertainties are considered negligible over the range of dic 0 06 mol l and pco2 1 atm values chiodini et al 2000 according to the relationship between water temperature and δ13cdic co2 δ13cdic co2 δ13cdic δ13cco2 values xu et al 2022 only samples that follow the theoretical carbon isotope fractionation line in the hco3 and co2 system mook et al 1974 are used for calculation in this model the dic content associated with carbonate dissolution ccarb is calculated by subtracting gypsum derived ca content so4 in mol l from ca mg contents mol l chiodini et al 2000 ccarb ca mg so4 7 as discussed in section water rock interaction the dic contents of thermal waters discharging from the ygxfs cannot be explained solely by carbonate dissolution in the aquifer system and require the addition of external carbon cext to the total dic of thermal spring waters the cext has two potential sources i infiltrating water dominated by organic derived carbon corg and ii deeply sourced fluids that dissolve magmatic and or metamorphic carbon cendo the content and δ13c value of external carbon are calculated for each sample following equations chiodini et al 2000 chiodini et al 2004 cext dic ccarb 8 δ13cext δ13cdic δ13ccarb ccarb dic dic cext 9 the calculated cext contents in thermal waters vary from 3 47 to 40 32 mmol l along the xfs and from 1 35 to 39 60 mmol l along the ygfs respectively table 2 in order to quantitatively constrain the origin of external carbon in the thermal waters a binary mixing model is considered as follows karakuş et al 2019 δ13cext cext δ13corg corg δ13cendo cendo 10 in this model the organic carbon end member is assumed to have a δ13c value of 27 and variable carbon contents of 0 0005 0 001 mol l the endogenic carbon end member represents a mixture δ13cendo 1 5 cext 0 06 mg l of carbon from mantle degassing 6 5 2 5 sano and marty 1995 and decomposition of marine limestones fig 7 the average δ13c value of marine carbonate samples 0 4 n 61 from northwestern sichuan province the study area huang 1997 was used to calculate the δ13cendo value for all thermal water samples from the ygxfs the δ13cext values vary from 6 9 to 5 9 table 2 in the δ13cext vs cext concentration diagram fig 7 most thermal water samples plot within or on the mixing curves between organic and endogenic carbon end members similar results have been observed in thermal springs of the southern apennines in italy chiodini et al 2004 note that one sample has a δ13cext value higher than the endogenic carbon end member fig 7 this can be explained by significant near surface co2 degassing that drives the δ13cdic of the residual thermal waters to higher values evans et al 2008 the calculated proportions of different carbon sources ccarb corg and cendo are presented in table 2 and also shown in the inset of fig 7 the contribution of ccarb in total dic is 3 47 with a mean value of 10 the proportion of corg is generally low 0 17 while the cendo contribution 77 94 with an average value of 85 is more dominant in all thermal waters along the ygxfs it is difficult to discriminate mantle co2 and metamorphic co2 solely by water chemistry and δ13c data however a ternary mixing model based on the δ13cco2 and co2 3he data of hydrothermal gases reported in previous studies zhou et al 2015 fan et al 2019 suggests a relatively low proportion of mantle derived co2 5 12 the thermal breakdown of crustal marine limestones is the primary mechanism of co2 outgassing in terms of dissolved carbon and co2 rich free gases from thermal springs in the study area this may suggest relatively high temperatures in the deep structure of the ygxfs because the metamorphic decarbonization reaction of crustal marine limestones is suggested to occur only at a temperature of 400 c ferry 1991 5 4 reservoir temperature and circulation depth for the thermal springs along the ygxfs the reservoir temperatures calculated by na k geothermometer 91 323 c are higher than those from na k ca 88 280 c and k mg 24 150 c geothermometers table 3 the na k mg ternary diagram however shows that most thermal spring samples plot in the immature water zone especially for the samples with high contents of dissolved mg fig 8 a several samples from geothermal wells at kyga and gga plot in the field of partial equilibrium with host rocks indicating reservoir temperatures of 200 320 c fig 8a these samples can be interpreted as a mixture between deep geothermal fluids that are in full equilibrium with host rocks and unequilibrated shallow groundwater similarly the samples plotting on the same isotherm may suggest mixing between deeply sourced geothermal fluids and shallow groundwaters fig 8a in the 10mg 10mg ca versus 10k 10k na diagram fig 8b most thermal spring samples are also away from the equilibrium curve suggesting that they are not equilibrated with average crustal rocks these immature thermal waters have relatively high mg contents and δd δ18o values close to the meteoric water line which can be attributed to the limited water rock reaction resulting from mixing with cold water the immature waters indicate that the results of ionic solute geothermometers should be taken with caution due to re equilibration during the ascent of fluid to the surface silica geothermometers are commonly applied to estimate subsurface temperature peralta arnold et al 2017 fan et al 2019 temperatures of geothermal reservoirs calculated from silica geothermometers depend on silica contents in the water controlled by the amount of dissolved silica polymorphs such as quartz chalcedony cristobalite and amorphous silica peralta arnold et al 2017 most thermal waters are close to saturation with chalcedony and moderate saturation with quartz and calcite the equilibrium reservoir temperatures of thermal springs were estimated by different geothermometers based on mineral saturation indices sis table 3 in the log sio2 content vs log k2 mg diagram fig 9 most thermal water samples are situated near or above the chalcedony line and are between the quartz and amorphous silica lines the chalcedony geothermometer yields a wide range of reservoir temperatures 56 321 c for thermal water along the ygxfs these results are similar to reservoir temperatures based on quartz geothermometer maximum steam loss 88 288 c no steam loss 94 288 c and 85 288 c and are generally 20 c higher than ɑ cristobalite geothermometers table 3 considering the dilution effect induced by mixing with cold groundwaters quartz geothermometers appear to provide the lowest reservoir temperatures most of the thermal waters along the ygxfs were sampled from natural manifestations and shallow drilled wells that may be contaminated differently due to cold water addition however some thermal waters from the deep geothermal wells in kyga only have a slight effect from cold water mixing li et al 2020 the silica enthalpy mixing model has been extensively used for estimating the mixing ratio of cold and hot water fournier and truesdell 1974 the reservoir temperatures and mixing proportions of cold water calculated by silica enthalpy are 125 280 c and 38 94 in thermal waters along the ygxfs respectively we thus suggest that shallower cold waters have affected the hydrothermal fluids from deeper aquifers variously in this case the calculation of the minimum subsurface temperatures by quartz geothermometers for these thermal springs is possible additionally the na k geothermometers are suitable for partially and fully equilibrated waters from deep geothermal wells at kyga and gga according to the subsurface temperatures estimated by quartz geothermometers table 3 the maximum circulation depth of geothermal waters is estimated as follows yang et al 2019 d m tr ta δg hc x where d is the groundwater circulation depth in m tr is the reservoir temperature c calculated for each thermal spring using chalcedony geothermometers table 3 ta is the mean annual air temperature of 7 c at kangding region wang et al 2019 and 5 c at ganzi region fan et al 2019 respectively δg is the geothermal gradient of 49 c km for kangding area zhang 2018 and 32 7 c km for ganzi area fan et al 2019 respectively hc is constant temperature zone at the depth of 20 m zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021b except for samples gb jy yd and jk table 3 the estimated circulation depths of thermal waters along the ygxfs vary in 1802 6186 m with an average of 3222 m our results are consistent with fluid circulation depths estimated by previous studies 3 6 km fan et al 2019 li et al 2020 and are supported by the 3d electrical model in ganzi basin cheng et al 2021 5 5 implications for regional seismic activity the ygxfs in the eastern tibet plateau has been a tectonically active fault since middle miocene time 13 ma roger et al 1995 chevalier et al 2017 due to the continuous india asia collision and is a focal zone with high earthquake risk at present the controlling factors for earthquake distribution along an active fault zone are various e g stress distribution locking status and fault geometry and in particular the role of deep fluids in triggering earthquakes has been noticed for years chiodini et al 2020 and references therein in this section we present new insights from geothermal fluid circulation within fault system for seismic activity along the ygxfs based on the interpretation on spatial features of geothermal anomalies and uprising of deep fluids the ygxfs is located in a transitional zone between high heat flow anomalies of the tibetan himalayan orogenic belt and low heat flow anomalies of the sichuan basin jiang et al 2019 suggesting the potential influence of deep geothermal fluids i e heat flow anomalies on tectonic activities of this boundary fault we found that the estimated average subsurface reservoir temperature of the thermal springs displays a northwestward decreasing trend along the xfs segments and the ygfs segment fig 10 a with two striking geothermal anomalies focusing on the kangding and ganzi region this is consistent with the results of discharging water temperatures along the ygxfs observed in the field table 1 considering fault geometry of the ygxfs we suggest that the spatial distribution of geothermal anomalies can be explained by localized interaction of several crossing and deep cutting fault segments fig 10 which provide favorable conduits for heat transfer and uprising of deep fluids and result in zonal distribution of shallow geothermal anomalies along the ygxfs tang et al 2017a it is noted that the epicenters of historical strong earthquakes ms 6 5 along the ygxfs mainly occurred close to the margin of geothermal anomalies and or the transition zone between geothermal gradients fig 10a this may suggest potential genetic links between lithospheric thermal structure and earthquake nucleation along active fault similar to previous observations in southeastern tibetan plateau wang et al 2018 and western north america wong and chapman 1990 most earthquakes along the ygxfs have hypocenter depths ranging in 5 20 km with the focal zone generally below the circulation depths of thermal waters ca 2 6 km table 3 and fig 10b but corresponding with the uppermost part of low velocity and high conductivity layers cheng et al 2011 lei and zhao 2016 nevertheless geothermal anomalies along the ygxfs are closely related with deeper source of heat and materials which can be provided by the deep fluids and or partial melts at the mid lower crustal depths i e the geophysically detected low velocity and high conductivity layers bai et al 2010 wang et al 2010 beneath eastern tibetan plateau as shown in fig 10b and 10c a comparison between fluid circulation depths and numbers of earthquakes along the ygxfs suggests that earthquakes tend to occur beneath the regions with larger depths of fluid circulation i e kangding and ganzi consistent with the localized geothermal anomalies fig 10a therefore we suggest that the distribution of geothermal anomalies along the ygxfs is indicative of localized occurrence of seismic activity which highlights the importance of geothermal fluid monitoring along active faults for obtaining effective pre earthquake signals okada et al 2015 gori and barberio 2022 previous studies have proposed that the reactivation of faults and migration of deep fluids in the fault system may be important controlling factors for regional seismic activity and geothermal anomalies e g di luccio et al 2010 doglioni et al 2014 wang et al 2018 the addition of deeply sourced fluids into seismogenic layer within fault zones likely decreases the mechanic strength of rocks and the friction between the faults and acts as a trigger for earthquakes sano et al 2014 lei and zhao 2016 wang et al 2018 for example chiodini et al 2020 proposed that seismicity in the apennines italy is modulated by the ascent of deep co2 rich fluids along deep seated faults which result in over pressurized co2 rich reservoirs in the crust and trigger earthquakes at crustal depths chiodini et al 2020 sano et al 2020 we present a mass balance model for co2 sources of thermal spring waters along the ygxfs and the results indicate that these springs have an input of deeply derived co2 bearing fluids this is clearly shown by the higher pco2 values and high δ13cdic values 4 3 to 5 9 in thermal water which point to thermo metamorphic decarbonation and possible mantle fluid inputs the identification of deep fluids uprising through the ygxfs fig 7 lends support to the possible role of deep fluids and or heat in the genesis of regional seismic activities additionally heat stress fields produced by the non uniform distribution of heat and geothermal structure inthe deeplithosphere also potentially account for earthquakes wang et al 2018 therefore we suggest that the lithospheric thermal structure e g regional geothermal anomalies and geochemically identified uprising deep fluids of the ygxfs controlled by fault related heat transfer and metamorphic decarbonation and or mantle fluid release may play an important role in modulating the distribution of regional seismic activities 6 conclusions according to the hydrochemical interpretation of thermal waters and the tectonic setting of the ygxfs a genetic model is proposed for the origin and evolution of hydrothermal fluid fig 11 the discharge temperatures of thermal springs decrease gradually from kyga up to 76 c to dlhwz 18 4 c along the xfs and from gga 74 6 c to dghwz 28 4 c along the ygfs thermal waters along the ygxfs can be divided into three types i na hco3 type waters controlled by the dissolution of silicate minerals e g albite ii ca na hco3 type waters affected by the dissolution of silicate and carbonate minerals iii na hco3 cl type waters influenced by silicate dissolution and the mixing with deeply sourced fluids the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions indicate that thermal waters are in meteoric water origin the sources of co2 dissolved in thermal waters are attributed to the dissolution of carbonate minerals soil organic carbon metamorphic carbon derived from marine limestones and mantle derived carbon reservoir temperature estimated by multi geothermometers varies in a wide range and displays a decreasing tendency northwestward along the ygxfs the results of geothermometers and geochemical data suggest that the average circulation depth is of approximately 3 km along the ygxfs and various degrees of mixing between the uprising thermal waters and shallow cold waters based on geological information with historical seismic data the epicenters of strong earthquakes are found to be mostly located in the transitional zone of geothermal anomalies revealed by geothermal reservoir temperatures we thus suggest that the heterogeneity of lithospheric thermal structure and the upwelling of deep fluids possibly play an important role in the high frequency of thermal spring and seismic activity along the

3615,hydrothermal activity and seismicity are abundant along the yushu ganzi xianshuihe fault system ygxfs in the eastern tibetan plateau however the processes and factors that control hydrothermal fluid circulation at a regional scale remain less constrained and the relationship between geothermal anomaly and seismic activity is poorly known in this study we report an integrated dataset of thermal water chemistry δ18oh2o δdh2o and δ13c of dissolved inorganic carbon dic to identify the origin circulation path and reservoir properties of hydrothermal fluids and then reveal the relationship between fluid circulation and seismic activity the thermal waters are mainly classified as na hco3 type with minor ca na hco3 and na hco3 cl types the δ18oh2o 18 7 to 14 5 and δdh2o 142 to 110 values indicate recharge of meteoric waters which infiltrated along the ygxfs to 2 6 km depths and underwent mixing with deep fluids prior to their discharge at the surface a mass balance model based on δ13cdic values 4 3 to 5 9 and dic contents of thermal waters reveals the involvement of co2 bearing fluids from mantle and thermo metamorphic decarbonation of crustal marine limestones in tectonic co2 outgassing from the active fault the estimated reservoir temperatures 85 336 c based on silica geothermometer of the thermal waters decrease from southeast to northwest along the ygxfs notably the epicenters of strong earthquakes ms 6 are mostly located in the transition zone of geothermal anomalies according to spatial distribution of the reservoir temperatures combined with geological and geophysical information we suggest that the heterogeneity of crustal thermal structure and the upwelling of deep fluids may play an essential role in the distribution of thermal springs

as the surface expressions of energy released from earth s interior hydrothermal and seismic activities are closely correlated in active fault zones wang et al 2019a and references therein it is widely observed in extensional compressional and strike slip tectonic settings that seismically active fault zones provide conduits for upwelling of hydrothermal fluids chiodini et al 2020 and references therein previous seismic tomography results have revealed the cluster distribution of earthquakes around the zones that have anomalies of low seismic velocity kato et al 2013 okada et al 2015 lei and zhao 2016 or thermal anomalies associated with magma intrusions and or storage of deep fluids zhao et al 2010 at crustal and mantle depths these studies also have illustrated that the deeply circulated hydrothermal fluids within active fault zones can lead to weakening of seismogenic layers and thus facilitate nucleation of earthquakes terakawa et al 2010 kato et al 2013 okada et al 2015 diamond et al 2018 coppola et al 2021 on the other hand seismic activities can also cause changes of various physico chemical properties of crustal fluids nakagawa et al 2020 gori and barberio 2022 a series of earthquake related changes in hydrologic conditions elemental and isotopic compositions of groundwaters discharged from active faults have been regarded as important indexes for earthquake forecasting e g skelton et al 2014 li et al 2019a li et al 2019b hosono et al 2020 nakagawa et al 2020 yan et al 2021 franchini et al 2021 the circulation depth reservoir temperature and geochemistry of hydrothermal fluids are affected by fault structures involved in earthquake nucleation over variable spatial scales including microscale fractures in dilated rocks of individual fault and kilometer scale fault displacements across the lithosphere scott et al 2020 this provides a physico chemical basis for exploring the possible relationships between geothermal anomalies fluid geochemistry and seismic activities along the active faults the tibetan himalayan orogenic belt as a result of the collision between the indian and eurasian continents is one of the largest focal zones of geothermal anomalies and seismic activities on earth hubbard and shaw 2009 tang et al 2017a tang et al 2017b in particular there are 248 thermal springs distributed along active fault zones in the eastern tibetan plateau among these active faults the yushu ganzi xianshuihe fault system ygxfs fig 1 is an important strike slip boundary fault in the eastern tibetan plateau along which high compressive stresses and clusters of thermal springs are observed zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021b at least sixteen ms 6 earthquakes have occurred along the ygxfs since 1700 allen et al 1991 with recent strong earthquakes hitting its northwestern segment in 2010 i e mw 7 1 yushu earthquake and its southeastern segment in 2014 i e mw 6 3 kangding earthquake yan and lin 2015 thus the ygxfs has long been regarded as the target area of earthquake hazard prevention it is noted that previous studies mainly focused on the geochemistry of hydrothermal fluids at single or limited localities of thermal springs along the ygxfs fan et al 2019 guo et al 2017 li et al 2018 li et al 2020 the genetic links between geothermal anomalies and regional seismicity are less understood therefore a detailed geochemical study on hydrothermal fluids discharging from this fault system would contribute to a better understanding of the relationships between hydrochemical processes geothermal reservoirs and seismic activities in this study we present new data of physico chemical parameters hydrochemical and isotopic compositions δ18oh2o δdh2o and δ13cdic of hydrothermal fluids from 24 localities along a 500 km long segment of the ygxfs 70 of its total length our data combined with literature data provide a good opportunity for understanding the relationship between fluid geochemistry and seismicity distribution along the ygxfs the goals of this study are i to classify the types of thermal waters and evaluate related controlling factors ii to constrain the fluid origin and hydrothermal processes such as fluid mixing and water rock interaction and iii to estimate reservoir temperatures and explore the genetic links between lithospheric thermal structure and regional earthquake distribution 2 geological setting 2 1 yushu ganzi xianshuihe fault system the large active faults in the tibetan plateau result from the continental collision of the indian and eurasian plates which are converging at a relative rate of 40 50 mm yr zhang et al 2004 the northward subduction of the indian plate beneath the eurasian plate generates e w and nw se trending large left lateral strike slip fault system including the kunlun and ygxfs fig 1a wei et al 2017 these faults collectively accommodate the shortening of tibetan crust during india eurasia collision gao et al 2019 extending 800 km from the interior of the tibetan plateau to its southeastern margin along a ne trending arcuate structure yan and lin 2015 the ygxfs experienced large scale left lateral slip at a rate of approximately 4 6 12 mm yr and is one of the major active fault systems in tibetan plateau fig 1a spatially this active fault system consists of the yushu ganzi fault system ygfs in the northwest and the xianshuihe fault system xfs in the southeast fig 1b forming an important geological and geophysical boundary between the songpan ganzi block sgb and the sichuan yunnan block syb the ygfs extends 500 km from qinghai province in the northwest to sichuan province in the southeast with a dipping angle of 70 85 to ne and a width of 50 100 m in the triassic sedimentary rocks li et al 2013 these sedimentary rocks are widely exposed throughout the sgb mainly composed of feldspathic sandstones quartzose sandstones siltstones and silty slates the extensive outcrops of the triassic arc related calc alkaline igneous rocks clastics and carbonates in the southeast of the fault are locally intruded by meso cenozoic plutons the sinistral strike slip movement of ygfs resulted in striking relics in the landscape forming a series of quaternary strike slip structures and narrow small pull apart basins such as ganzi dengke and jielong li et al 2013 the 370 km long xfs is a curved ne trending strike slip fault and is the boundary between syb and sgb triassic flysch associations that consist of deformed and metamorphic feldspar quartz sandstones tuffaceous sandstones siltstones and mudstones are exposed widely on both sides of the xfs tang et al 2017a the outcropped precambrian and paleozoic rocks in the east of xfs include epi metamorphic sandstones slates limestone lenses limestones and metamorphic quartz sandstones wang et al 1998 wang et al 2019 triassic strata near the xfs are intruded by multi stages of granitoid including pre mesozoic granites triassic granites and jurassic granitic rocks the gonggan granites and zheduo granites with ages of 12 18 ma li and zhang 2013 and 13 4 ma tang et al 2017a are distributed along the xfs suggesting that magmatism and strike slip movement of the xfs may be synchronous near the shimian county to the southeast the xfs branches into the anninghe and daliangshan fault system wang et al 1998 yan and lin 2015 2 2

discharge temperatures of thermal springs display a decreasing trend towards the nw along the xfs and ygfs segments of the active fault system 4 2 hydrochemical characteristics major ions composition of thermal waters shows that most of the thermal springs along the ygxfs are na hco3 type waters and a few thermal springs along the xfs are mainly ca na hco3 type fig 3 a all surficial waters are ca mg hco3 type in the cl so4 hco3 diagram fig 3b giggenbach 1988 all the spring waters along the ygxfs fall into the peripheral bicarbonate water field with a linear evolutionary trend toward the hco3 corner some thermal waters from geothermal wells at the kyga contain an elevated sulfate concentration and belong to the group of mature water the pco2 values of thermal springs along the xfs and ygfs

waters in geothermal systems oxygen and hydrogen isotopes are widely used to determine the origin of thermal waters secondary processes and water rock interaction d amore and panichi 1985 xu et al 2022 as shown in the δd vs δ18o diagram fig 5 most of the thermal springs and surface waters along the ygxfs are located along the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 and local meteoric water line lmwl wu 2009 in chengdu of sichuan province indicating the meteoric origin note that some samples from geothermal springs and wells at gga and kyga have a slight δ18o shift fig 5 it might be attributed to water rock interaction in a high temperature geothermal system such isotopic shift depends on reservoir temperature mineralogy and permeability of the rocks and duration time of water rock reaction karakuş et al 2019 and references therein the extent of positive 18o shift observed in the kyga and gga samples is within 4 fig 5 table 2 and s1 resulting from the 18o exchange between thermal fluids and oxygen bearing minerals in the geothermal reservoir topographically there are 45 mountains with elevations 6000 m above sea level asl around the ygxfs including the 6168 m high mt queer manigange area 7556 m high mt gongga south of kangding area and mt zhuodana southern ganzi with a snow capped peak at 5200 m asl the recharged waters along the ygxfs are composed of local meteoric water including snow and glacier meltwater and connate groundwater derived from the surrounding mountains 5 2 water rock interaction chemical compositions of hydrothermal fluids are strongly affected by the water rock interaction processes in aquifer systems through chemical reactions such as the dissolution and precipitation of minerals e g carbonate silicate halite and sulfate from country rocks or near surface sediments oxidation reduction reaction and ion exchange reaction negri et al 2018 mukherjee and singh 2018 2020 the carbonic acid is formed by the dissolution of ascending co2 from crust and mantle degassing eq 1 along the fault zone into shallow groundwaters in these geothermal areas fan et al 2019 xu et al 2022 carbonic acid is a weak acid and easily converted to hco3 in the water eq 2 mukherjee and singh 2018 the concentrations of na and k in geothermal waters are controlled by the dissolution of silicates rocks such as pyroxene albite and na feldspar eq 3 the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 by carbonate minerals mainly calcite limestone dolomite and magnesite eq 4 5 silicate minerals such as plagioclase feldspar eq 4 and sulfides evaporites gypsum and so4 2 by alunite or gypsum eq 6 thus the variations between major cations e g na ca2 and mg2 and anions e g hco3 cl and so4 2 could be used to discriminate the water rock interaction processes that have affected the water chemistry of the ygxfs fig 6 major chemical reactions involved in the water rock interaction of the aquifer system are shown as follows c o 2 h 2 o h 2 c o 3 1 2

in addition to silicate dissolution the dissolution of calcite dolomite and gypsum would lead to enrichments in ca2 mg2 hco3 and so4 2 fig 6b d and dissolution of halite contributes to the elevated na k and cl in groundwater fig 6e mukherjee and singh 2022 the mineral dissolution reactions together with ion exchange reactions fig 6f are generally responsible for the charge balance between cations and anions for the aquifer system in na vs hco3 diagram except for some samples from geothermal well most thermal spring waters along the ygxfs are plotted on and or below the 1 1 line fig 6a the line reflects the ideal mole ratio between na and hco3 in the case of equilibrium state of silicate e g albite dissolution in carbonic acid fluids this suggests the effects of silicate dissolution and is supported by the na excess relative to cl fig 6e most thermal springs along the ygxfs are na hco3 type waters and are slightly acidic to neutral ph 6 2 7 4 table 1 the na hco3 type waters are commonly associated with dissolution of silicate minerals e g albite fig 6a in carbonic acid aquifers aydin et al 2020 this is consistent with the observation that thermal springs in the study area are mainly exposed to silicate country rocks e g granitic masses and triassic sedimentary rocks the silicate dissolution is also reflected by the plot of hco3 so4 vs ca mg fig 6d if these ions are sorely derived from dissolution of calcite dolomite and gypsum the equivalent ratio of hco3 so4 ca mg should approach 1 1 however most thermal waters plot in the upper field of the 1 1 line fig 6d the excess hco3 so4 may originate from deeper sources e g deep fluids in addition to dissolution of minerals at the shallow aquifer depths kagoshima et al 2015 zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021b in this case na derived from dissolution of silicate minerals is required to maintain charge balance between anions and cations fisher and mullican 1997 the high ca so4 ratios 1 fig 6c can be attributed to i carbonate dissolution that accounts for ca2 excess relative to so4 2 and or ii the decrease in so4 2 content due to sulfate reduction the ca na hco3 types of some thermal waters at kyga could represent a mixture of na hco3 type dissolution of silicate rocks and ca hco3 type dissolution of carbonate rocks waters the effect of ion exchange reaction on anion concentrations was evaluated by the plot of ca mg so4 hco3 vs na k cl fig 6f it is noted that most samples along the ygxfs are close to the 1 1 line indicating the major cation participate in the ion exchange reaction in addition the thermal waters along the ygxfs are generally enriched in na with respect to cl fig 6e na and cl in fluid are commonly attributed to the dissolution of halite however no evaporite units are found in the study area that can contribute na and cl into thermal waters the cl enrichment in geothermal well waters was likely inherited from high temperature geothermal reservoirs where the host rock minerals are equilibrated with deep fluids that are enriched in cl giggenbach 1991 the mixing between groundwaters and deep fluids could explain the presence of na cl hco3 type waters at kyga a striking feature of the studied thermal springs along the ygxfs is that almost all the samples have lower ca mg hco3 ratios relative to the 1 1 line fig 6b this observation together with the ca derived from gypsum dissolution fig 6c and high hco3 so4 ca mg ratios 1 fig 6d unambitiously point to a significant hco3 enrichment in the thermal waters this is consistent with pco2 and ph values of the studied thermal springs for outflowing groundwater in active fault zones the dissolution and contents of dic are associated with pco2 and ph values macpherson et al 2008 as shown in table 2 the pco2 values of thermal spring waters from the ygxfs are remarkably higher than the atmospheric pco2 level suggesting strong co2 degassing at the surface as observed in the field fig 2 5 3 origin of dissolved carbon in groundwaters possible sources of carbon dissolved in groundwaters include atmospheric co2 dissolved by meteoric water catm soil co2 of organic origin corg dissolution of carbonate minerals ccarb and endogenic co2 cendo produced by magmatic and or metamorphic degassing chiodini et al 2000 2004 these carbon sources contribute to the total dic h2co3 hco3 and co3 2 in the thermal waters the atmospheric co2 with an average δ13c value of 7 usually has a negligible contribution to total dic in recharged water due to remarkably low atmospheric pco2 value 0 0003 atm karakuş et al 2019 as such the δ13cdic of recharged water is dominated by soil co2 e g δ13c 22 to 34 robinson and scrimgeour 1995 the co2 derived from dissolution of carbonate minerals in the shallow aquifer system δ13c 0 3 newell et al 2008 and deeply sourced carbon including magmatic co2 δ13c 6 5 2 5 sano and marty 1995 and metamorphic co2 of various source rocks δ13c 30 to 0 newell et al 2008 a mass balance model based on water chemistry and δ13cdic values chiodini et al 2000 2004 was used to constrain the origin of carbon dissolved in thermal spring waters it should be noted that this model requires the equilibrium in carbon isotope fractionation during co2 degassing and or calcite precipitation for this study these uncertainties are considered negligible over the range of dic 0 06 mol l and pco2 1 atm values chiodini et al 2000 according to the relationship between water temperature and δ13cdic co2 δ13cdic co2 δ13cdic δ13cco2 values xu et al 2022 only samples that follow the theoretical carbon isotope fractionation line in the hco3 and co2 system mook et al 1974 are used for calculation in this model the dic content associated with carbonate dissolution ccarb is calculated by subtracting gypsum derived ca content so4 in mol l from ca mg contents mol l chiodini et al 2000 ccarb ca mg so4 7 as discussed in section water rock interaction the dic contents of thermal waters discharging from the ygxfs cannot be explained solely by carbonate dissolution in the aquifer system and require the addition of external carbon cext to the total dic of thermal spring waters the cext has two potential sources i infiltrating water dominated by organic derived carbon corg and ii deeply sourced fluids that dissolve magmatic and or metamorphic carbon cendo the content and δ13c value of external carbon are calculated for each sample following equations chiodini et al 2000 chiodini et al 2004 cext dic ccarb 8 δ13cext δ13cdic δ13ccarb ccarb dic dic cext 9 the calculated cext contents in thermal waters vary from 3 47 to 40 32 mmol l along the xfs and from 1 35 to 39 60 mmol l along the ygfs respectively table 2 in order to quantitatively constrain the origin of external carbon in the thermal waters a binary mixing model is considered as follows karakuş et al 2019 δ13cext cext δ13corg corg δ13cendo cendo 10 in this model the organic carbon end member is assumed to have a δ13c value of 27 and variable carbon contents of 0 0005 0 001 mol l the endogenic carbon end member represents a mixture δ13cendo 1 5 cext 0 06 mg l of carbon from mantle degassing 6 5 2 5 sano and marty 1995 and decomposition of marine limestones fig 7 the average δ13c value of marine carbonate samples 0 4 n 61 from northwestern sichuan province the study area huang 1997 was used to calculate the δ13cendo value for all thermal water samples from the ygxfs the δ13cext values vary from 6 9 to 5 9 table 2 in the δ13cext vs cext concentration diagram fig 7 most thermal water samples plot within or on the mixing curves between organic and endogenic carbon end members similar results have been observed in thermal springs of the southern apennines in italy chiodini et al 2004 note that one sample has a δ13cext value higher than the endogenic carbon end member fig 7 this can be explained by significant near surface co2 degassing that drives the δ13cdic of the residual thermal waters to higher values evans et al 2008 the calculated proportions of different carbon sources ccarb corg and cendo are presented in table 2 and also shown in the inset of fig 7 the contribution of ccarb in total dic is 3 47 with a mean value of 10 the proportion of corg is generally low 0 17 while the cendo contribution 77 94 with an average value of 85 is more dominant in all thermal waters along the ygxfs it is difficult to discriminate mantle co2 and metamorphic co2 solely by water chemistry and δ13c data however a ternary mixing model based on the δ13cco2 and co2 3he data of hydrothermal gases reported in previous studies zhou et al 2015 fan et al 2019 suggests a relatively low proportion of mantle derived co2 5 12 the thermal breakdown of crustal marine limestones is the primary mechanism of co2 outgassing in terms of dissolved carbon and co2 rich free gases from thermal springs in the study area this may suggest relatively high temperatures in the deep structure of the ygxfs because the metamorphic decarbonization reaction of crustal marine limestones is suggested to occur only at a temperature of 400 c ferry 1991 5 4 reservoir temperature and circulation depth for the thermal springs along the ygxfs the reservoir temperatures calculated by na k geothermometer 91 323 c are higher than those from na k ca 88 280 c and k mg 24 150 c geothermometers table 3 the na k mg ternary diagram however shows that most thermal spring samples plot in the immature water zone especially for the samples with high contents of dissolved mg fig 8 a several samples from geothermal wells at kyga and gga plot in the field of partial equilibrium with host rocks indicating reservoir temperatures of 200 320 c fig 8a these samples can be interpreted as a mixture between deep geothermal fluids that are in full equilibrium with host rocks and unequilibrated shallow groundwater similarly the samples plotting on the same isotherm may suggest mixing between deeply sourced geothermal fluids and shallow groundwaters fig 8a in the 10mg 10mg ca versus 10k 10k na diagram fig 8b most thermal spring samples are also away from the equilibrium curve suggesting that they are not equilibrated with average crustal rocks these immature thermal waters have relatively high mg contents and δd δ18o values close to the meteoric water line which can be attributed to the limited water rock reaction resulting from mixing with cold water the immature waters indicate that the results of ionic solute geothermometers should be taken with caution due to re equilibration during the ascent of fluid to the surface silica geothermometers are commonly applied to estimate subsurface temperature peralta arnold et al 2017 fan et al 2019 temperatures of geothermal reservoirs calculated from silica geothermometers depend on silica contents in the water controlled by the amount of dissolved silica polymorphs such as quartz chalcedony cristobalite and amorphous silica peralta arnold et al 2017 most thermal waters are close to saturation with chalcedony and moderate saturation with quartz and calcite the equilibrium reservoir temperatures of thermal springs were estimated by different geothermometers based on mineral saturation indices sis table 3 in the log sio2 content vs log k2 mg diagram fig 9 most thermal water samples are situated near or above the chalcedony line and are between the quartz and amorphous silica lines the chalcedony geothermometer yields a wide range of reservoir temperatures 56 321 c for thermal water along the ygxfs these results are similar to reservoir temperatures based on quartz geothermometer maximum steam loss 88 288 c no steam loss 94 288 c and 85 288 c and are generally 20 c higher than ɑ cristobalite geothermometers table 3 considering the dilution effect induced by mixing with cold groundwaters quartz geothermometers appear to provide the lowest reservoir temperatures most of the thermal waters along the ygxfs were sampled from natural manifestations and shallow drilled wells that may be contaminated differently due to cold water addition however some thermal waters from the deep geothermal wells in kyga only have a slight effect from cold water mixing li et al 2020 the silica enthalpy mixing model has been extensively used for estimating the mixing ratio of cold and hot water fournier and truesdell 1974 the reservoir temperatures and mixing proportions of cold water calculated by silica enthalpy are 125 280 c and 38 94 in thermal waters along the ygxfs respectively we thus suggest that shallower cold waters have affected the hydrothermal fluids from deeper aquifers variously in this case the calculation of the minimum subsurface temperatures by quartz geothermometers for these thermal springs is possible additionally the na k geothermometers are suitable for partially and fully equilibrated waters from deep geothermal wells at kyga and gga according to the subsurface temperatures estimated by quartz geothermometers table 3 the maximum circulation depth of geothermal waters is estimated as follows yang et al 2019 d m tr ta δg hc x where d is the groundwater circulation depth in m tr is the reservoir temperature c calculated for each thermal spring using chalcedony geothermometers table 3 ta is the mean annual air temperature of 7 c at kangding region wang et al 2019 and 5 c at ganzi region fan et al 2019 respectively δg is the geothermal gradient of 49 c km for kangding area zhang 2018 and 32 7 c km for ganzi area fan et al 2019 respectively hc is constant temperature zone at the depth of 20 m zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2021b except for samples gb jy yd and jk table 3 the estimated circulation depths of thermal waters along the ygxfs vary in 1802 6186 m with an average of 3222 m our results are consistent with fluid circulation depths estimated by previous studies 3 6 km fan et al 2019 li et al 2020 and are supported by the 3d electrical model in ganzi basin cheng et al 2021 5 5 implications for regional seismic activity the ygxfs in the eastern tibet plateau has been a tectonically active fault since middle miocene time 13 ma roger et al 1995 chevalier et al 2017 due to the continuous india asia collision and is a focal zone with high earthquake risk at present the controlling factors for earthquake distribution along an active fault zone are various e g stress distribution locking status and fault geometry and in particular the role of deep fluids in triggering earthquakes has been noticed for years chiodini et al 2020 and references therein in this section we present new insights from geothermal fluid circulation within fault system for seismic activity along the ygxfs based on the interpretation on spatial features of geothermal anomalies and uprising of deep fluids the ygxfs is located in a transitional zone between high heat flow anomalies of the tibetan himalayan orogenic belt and low heat flow anomalies of the sichuan basin jiang et al 2019 suggesting the potential influence of deep geothermal fluids i e heat flow anomalies on tectonic activities of this boundary fault we found that the estimated average subsurface reservoir temperature of the thermal springs displays a northwestward decreasing trend along the xfs segments and the ygfs segment fig 10 a with two striking geothermal anomalies focusing on the kangding and ganzi region this is consistent with the results of discharging water temperatures along the ygxfs observed in the field table 1 considering fault geometry of the ygxfs we suggest that the spatial distribution of geothermal anomalies can be explained by localized interaction of several crossing and deep cutting fault segments fig 10 which provide favorable conduits for heat transfer and uprising of deep fluids and result in zonal distribution of shallow geothermal anomalies along the ygxfs tang et al 2017a it is noted that the epicenters of historical strong earthquakes ms 6 5 along the ygxfs mainly occurred close to the margin of geothermal anomalies and or the transition zone between geothermal gradients fig 10a this may suggest potential genetic links between lithospheric thermal structure and earthquake nucleation along active fault similar to previous observations in southeastern tibetan plateau wang et al 2018 and western north america wong and chapman 1990 most earthquakes along the ygxfs have hypocenter depths ranging in 5 20 km with the focal zone generally below the circulation depths of thermal waters ca 2 6 km table 3 and fig 10b but corresponding with the uppermost part of low velocity and high conductivity layers cheng et al 2011 lei and zhao 2016 nevertheless geothermal anomalies along the ygxfs are closely related with deeper source of heat and materials which can be provided by the deep fluids and or partial melts at the mid lower crustal depths i e the geophysically detected low velocity and high conductivity layers bai et al 2010 wang et al 2010 beneath eastern tibetan plateau as shown in fig 10b and 10c a comparison between fluid circulation depths and numbers of earthquakes along the ygxfs suggests that earthquakes tend to occur beneath the regions with larger depths of fluid circulation i e kangding and ganzi consistent with the localized geothermal anomalies fig 10a therefore we suggest that the distribution of geothermal anomalies along the ygxfs is indicative of localized occurrence of seismic activity which highlights the importance of geothermal fluid monitoring along active faults for obtaining effective pre earthquake signals okada et al 2015 gori and barberio 2022 previous studies have proposed that the reactivation of faults and migration of deep fluids in the fault system may be important controlling factors for regional seismic activity and geothermal anomalies e g di luccio et al 2010 doglioni et al 2014 wang et al 2018 the addition of deeply sourced fluids into seismogenic layer within fault zones likely decreases the mechanic strength of rocks and the friction between the faults and acts as a trigger for earthquakes sano et al 2014 lei and zhao 2016 wang et al 2018 for example chiodini et al 2020 proposed that seismicity in the apennines italy is modulated by the ascent of deep co2 rich fluids along deep seated faults which result in over pressurized co2 rich reservoirs in the crust and trigger earthquakes at crustal depths chiodini et al 2020 sano et al 2020 we present a mass balance model for co2 sources of thermal spring waters along the ygxfs and the results indicate that these springs have an input of deeply derived co2 bearing fluids this is clearly shown by the higher pco2 values and high δ13cdic values 4 3 to 5 9 in thermal water which point to thermo metamorphic decarbonation and possible mantle fluid inputs the identification of deep fluids uprising through the ygxfs fig 7 lends support to the possible role of deep fluids and or heat in the genesis of regional seismic activities additionally heat stress fields produced by the non uniform distribution of heat and geothermal structure inthe deeplithosphere also potentially account for earthquakes wang et al 2018 therefore we suggest that the lithospheric thermal structure e g regional geothermal anomalies and geochemically identified uprising deep fluids of the ygxfs controlled by fault related heat transfer and metamorphic decarbonation and or mantle fluid release may play an important role in modulating the distribution of regional seismic activities 6 conclusions according to the hydrochemical interpretation of thermal waters and the tectonic setting of the ygxfs a genetic model is proposed for the origin and evolution of hydrothermal fluid fig 11 the discharge temperatures of thermal springs decrease gradually from kyga up to 76 c to dlhwz 18 4 c along the xfs and from gga 74 6 c to dghwz 28 4 c along the ygfs thermal waters along the ygxfs can be divided into three types i na hco3 type waters controlled by the dissolution of silicate minerals e g albite ii ca na hco3 type waters affected by the dissolution of silicate and carbonate minerals iii na hco3 cl type waters influenced by silicate dissolution and the mixing with deeply sourced fluids the stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions indicate that thermal waters are in meteoric water origin the sources of co2 dissolved in thermal waters are attributed to the dissolution of carbonate minerals soil organic carbon metamorphic carbon derived from marine limestones and mantle derived carbon reservoir temperature estimated by multi geothermometers varies in a wide range and displays a decreasing tendency northwestward along the ygxfs the results of geothermometers and geochemical data suggest that the average circulation depth is of approximately 3 km along the ygxfs and various degrees of mixing between the uprising thermal waters and shallow cold waters based on geological information with historical seismic data the epicenters of strong earthquakes are found to be mostly located in the transitional zone of geothermal anomalies revealed by geothermal reservoir temperatures we thus suggest that the heterogeneity of lithospheric thermal structure and the upwelling of deep fluids possibly play an important role in the high frequency of thermal spring and seismic activity along the

3616,decision support tools dsts are a type of innovation that can facilitate science based decision making including nonpoint source pollution management in agricultural watersheds however organizational readiness for adopting innovations is a topic that has received limited attention in the literature with the goal of filling this knowledge gap we draw upon the diffusion of innovations doi theory and literature around use of science by agency staff to assess united states department of agriculture natural resources conservation services usda nrcs readiness towards using the agricultural conservation planning framework acpf a type of dst to that end we conducted 23 semi structured in depth interviews with 27 nrcs staff holding leadership positions to explore how they perceive and use the acpf and their perceptions of organizational and structural elements that could enable or hinder nrcs readiness to adopt the acpf results suggest that nrcs readiness was an outcome of both organizational and individual level factors factors such as perceived scientific credibility and the influential role of leaders positively influenced nrcs readiness however factors such as low levels of acpf knowledge and perceived complexity negatively influenced nrcs readiness overall our findings suggest that nrcs is in the initial stages of getting ready to adopt the acpf and that there is a need for the agency to pilot acpf in different watersheds and measure social and bio physical outcomes keywords agricultural conservation planning framework diffusion innovations watershed assessment semi structured interviews organizational readiness 1 introduction the agriculture sector is replete with innovations ranging from those that were developed in the 1940 s e g hybrid corn to those that are relatively more recent e g precision agricultural technologies a hybrid corn study conducted several decades ago laid down the foundations for the diffusion of innovations doi theory and also established that diffusion is fundamentally a social process wherein innovations are adopted through subjective evaluations e g perceived norms rather than solely by economic rational decision making valente and rogers 1995 subsequently the scholarship around and applications of the doi theory has burgeoned to examine many elements of the diffusion process including the adopter i e the individual or decision making unit the change agent i e an individual who influences the adopter and the attributes of the innovation itself e g complexity of the innovation ranjan and witter 2020 rogers 1995 however an aspect of diffusion of innovations that has received limited attention in the literature is organizational readiness for innovation lokuge et al 2019 in particular scholars have identified the need for research around the steps that organizations can take to assess and anticipate the impacts of an innovation greenhalgh et al 2004 619 the innovation decision process is considered to be much more complex when the unit of adoption is an organization versus an individual rogers 1995 therefore as pointed out by rogers 1995 402 once an organization has made a decision to adopt implementation does not follow directly in a similar vein the fact that approximately 90 of new ideas never convert to new product or service deliveries because of the lack of organizational readiness further underscores the complexity of the innovation decision process when the unit of adoption is an organization lokuge et al 2019 445 the complexity of understanding organizational readiness to adopt an innovation motivated us to assess the united states department of agriculture natural resources conservation services usda nrcs henceforth nrcs readiness towards using the agricultural conservation planning framework acpf nrcs provided the context see section 3 1 for further details to assess organizational readiness to adopt whereas the acpf a scientific arcgis based decision support tool dst that helps semi automate the process of identifying field specific locations for placement of agricultural best management practices bmps within hydrologic unit code 12 huc 12 watersheds tomer et al 2015a ranjan et al 2019 was the innovation of interest see section 3 2 for further details whereas understanding organizational readiness provided a theoretical rationale for our study it was also motivated by an increasing level of interest within the nrcs to use tools like the acpf to spatially prioritize conservation planning efforts and redefine how resources are allocated indeed owing to the fairly recent availability of lidar based elevation data acpf can foster a small watershed approach wherein the hydrology of a huc 12 watershed can be analyzed as a whole to identify and prioritize hydrologic flow paths and critical source areas konopacky and ristino 2017 at a huc 12 watershed scale acpf marks the first time that the nrcs could easily and cost effectively prioritize their conservation efforts and therefore move away from the currently dominant approach of random acts of conservation knight 2005 137a however this perhaps fundamental shift is contingent upon nrcs readiness to change dsts such as the acpf are designed to facilitate effective science based decision making by intended users who in the context of our study are the managers and staff working for the nrcs however understanding and subsequently promoting the use of science by civil servants in government agencies hereafter agency staff is a complex endeavor agency staff s decision to adopt or reject a scientific innovation can be influenced by both organizational level factors e g agency research infrastructure and push for recruitment and skill development and individual level factors e g agency staff s prior knowledge and their perceptions of attributes of the innovation relative advantage compatibility complexity trialability observability and credibility ouimet et al 2009 rogers 1995 whereas organizational level factors can help gauge nrcs readiness towards using the acpf individual level factors can help reveal pathways that enable agency staff to overcome real and perceived barriers to using the acpf taken together these factors help unravel the organizational context within which an innovation can be adopted as such use of science has been studied in myriad contexts including the use of climate science by usda field staff and their readiness willingness and ability to act as climate advisors for farmers prokopy et al 2013 wiener et al 2020 and use of science in collaborative governance processes to inform ecosystem recovery planning efforts koontz 2019 in a similar vein the doi theory has been applied in many contexts including adoption of innovations by both individuals and organizations rogers 1995 and the development of the consolidated framework for implementation research a framework that includes doi constructs to help guide effective implementation of innovations in organizations keith et al 2017 consolidated framework for implementation research n d however what is missing in the current scholarship is using doi and use of science theories together to holistically examine organizational and individual level factors that can enable or hinder organizational innovation with the goal of using theory to assess nrcs readiness towards a fundamental shift in conservation planning we present findings from semi structured interviews conducted with nrcs staff holding leadership positions owing to technical advancements in conservation science including the use of computer simulations to develop agricultural models and usda supported collaborative initiatives such as the conservation effects assessment project agricultural dsts are increasingly becoming the norm rather than exception in conservation planning mason et al 2021 ranjan et al 2020a therefore there is an urgent need to understand and assess organizational readiness to embrace innovations such as the acpf which has the potential to encourage watershed thinking among agricultural stakeholders and expedite the process of conservation planning ranjan et al 2019 ranjan et al 2020b 2 study conceptualization there are three key components in our study 1 acpf the scientific innovation under consideration 2 nrcs the multi level organization within which the acpf is intended to be adopted and 3 agency staff the intended users of the acpf who work for the nrcs in order to theoretically contextualize our data we draw upon ouimet et al s 2009 conceptual framework on absorption of research knowledge by civil servants see figure 1 337 and rogers 1995 model of five stages in the innovation decision process see figure 5 1 170 and variables related to organizational innovativeness see figure 10 2 411 1 1 for a visual of the three figures please refer appendix 1 by integrating elements of two theoretical perspectives doi and use of science we are able to holistically examine organizational and individual level factors that can help us assess nrcs readiness for adopting the acpf drawing upon the influential work by weiner 2009 we conceptualize organizational readiness to be an outcome of agency staffs perception of nrcs commitment to change e g nrcs investing resources to fulfill acpf data requirements and their perceived efficacy to use the acpf referred to as change efficacy bringing together the two aforementioned theoretical perspectives and our definition of organizational readiness we postulate that agency staffs perceptions of the organization i e nrcs and the scientific innovation i e acpf will collectively influence their decision regarding whether or not and the degree to which findings from the acpf are incorporated into decision making e g development of conservation plans agency staffs decision about incorporating the acpf into their decision making is characterized as use of science in our study as pointed out by ouimet et al 2009 incorporating science in decision making involves several interconnected steps such as recognizing the value of information acquiring the information evaluating the information and finally applying the information these steps in the context of doi theory roughly translate to the five stages of the innovation decision process knowledge persuasion decision implementation and confirmation rogers 1995 170 doi theory goes on to identify several characteristics of the potential adopter and the innovation that affect likelihood of adoption rogers 1995 weiner 2009 in parallel use of science theory has identified several characteristics of the potential user and the science product that affect likelihood of use cash et al 2003 mcnie 2007 ouimet et al 2009 taken together the two theoretical perspectives highlight the factors and the decision making processes that come into play when a decision making unit readies itself to adopt an innovation we would like to acknowledge that the intended users of an innovation and the ways in which the innovation is put to use are not homogeneous within an organization for instance a set of agency staff e g gis specialists might interface more with the technical side of the acpf by running the acpf toolbox and generating datasets whereas another set of agency staff e g district conservationists might interface more with the socio technical side of the acpf by presenting acpf generated maps to farmers and explaining the technical and bio physical aspects of conservation planning for their farm making this role based distinction is important because it not only affects the ways in which an innovation is put to use but it could also affect agency staffs perceptions of barriers towards its adoption in their organization for example gis staff might perceive a need for the nrcs to support technical trainings and dataset preparation whereas field staff might perceive a need for the nrcs to support socio technical trainings that help them convey the technical aspects of conservation planning to farmers 3 innovation diffusion context the organization and the innovation 3 1 nrcs the organization the nrcs along with the farm production and conservation fpac business center farm service agency fsa and the risk management agency rma is housed within the usda to meet its farm production and conservation mission in order to fulfill this mission these agencies interact to mitigate risks provide conservation programs and technical assistance and deliver financial programs to farmers usda 2021 the nrcs also partners with other local city and county governments soil and water conservation districts swcds state state departments of agriculture resource management etc and federal u s fish and wildlife epa etc organizations to fulfill its mission the organizational structure of the nrcs flows from a national level to the field office level program development large scale funding priorities and goals are established at the national level which is then channeled to regional offices across the united states which serve as leadership representatives of the chief conservationist in washington dc nrcs 2021a at the state level state conservationist offices provide state specific management and directives to support administrative and technical functions for coordinating and implementing natural resource conservation often including public and private entities nrcs 2021b the nrcs and fsa have multiple field offices within each state that serve as the main points of contact for farmers the nrcs and fsa work in conjunction with local swcds to provide services to farmers for technical assistance financial and commodity programs field office organization varies state by state to be single county offices or clusters of counties within a field office service area to efficiently serve farmers the staffing at this level varies but the nrcs work conducted in field offices includes resource inventory and assessment technical assistance conservation planning bmp implementation and program administration 3 2 acpf the innovation and its current status of use the acpf is an innovative dst that uses watershed planning concepts to identify opportunities for bmp placement within field at the field edge and in riparian areas to reduce nutrient and sediment loss in agricultural landscapes tomer et al 2013 porter et al 2018 the acpf operationalizes watershed planning concepts using publicly available geospatial datasets and an arcgis toolbox to facilitate field scale bmp placement and watershed planning at the huc 12 watershed scale typically 15 000 40 000 acres or 6070 16 187 ha tomer et al 2015a ranjan et al 2019 using high resolution lidar based elevation data national agricultural statistics service cropland data layer nass cdl land use data usda nass 2019 nrcs soil survey soils database field boundary data and watershed boundary data the acpf enables 1 hydro conditioning terrain processing and hydro enforcement of elevation data to mimic expected flow of water over the actual terrain 2 delineation of the perennial stream network and catchments in a watershed 3 identification of fields in a watershed that may be most likely to contribute nutrients and sediment to surface water and 4 sites where within field edge of field and riparian bmps could be implemented porter et al 2018 presently the acpf identifies locations for the following bmps by evaluating site specific criteria and suitability drainage water management grassed waterways contour buffer strips bioreactors nutrient removal wetlands water and sediment control basins wascobs riparian buffers and saturated riparian buffers porter et al 2018 results from the acpf provide landowners land managers and conservation planners with suites of conservation planning options and opportunities ranjan et al 2019 zimmerman et al 2019 the acpf distills complex geospatial data processing and analyses into outputs for use in conservation planning outputs from acpf include attribute tables and maps that identify and visualize relatively high risk areas of the watershed and potential bmp locations see fig 1 the acpf does not provide site level engineering design information for specific bmp s however the analytical capacity of acpf is continually expanding for example recent add on acpf toolboxes are available to estimate nutrient reduction outcomes as a percent nitrate n reduction at basin scales or per unit load basis and financial costs associated with conservation scenarios bravard et al 2020 the acpf was initially developed in 2015 by a team of practitioners and researchers with applications in watersheds located in iowa and illinois tomer et al 2015a b since its initial development the acpf has been used to inform conservation planning in selected watersheds across the us midwest church et al 2019a rundhaug et al 2018 srinivas et al 2020 however the acpf is still in the nascent stages of being considered for widespread use across the nrcs in state and field level offices both within and outside the us midwest as such the overall awareness and usage of the acpf among conservation professionals including agency staff is low ranjan et al 2020a and the agency wide use of acpf has not been formalized in any state 4 methods the data for this study come from semi structured in depth interviews with nrcs staff holding leadership positions in the state or area offices of the nrcs specific states were selected under the purview of and with guidance from a bigger team that the authors of this study were part of under the larger team efforts to study nrcs readiness to adopt the acpf states participating in the study were classified as either current or novel state current states include those that are located in the upper midwest where individual agency staff have used the acpf as part of selected watershed projects and are therefore somewhat more familiar with how the acpf can be used to address state specific resource concerns novel states include those that are located outside the upper midwest and are characterized by either limited use by individual agency staff or familiarity with how the acpf can be used to address state specific resource concerns however as we mentioned earlier see section 3 2 agency wide use of acpf has not been formalized in any state within each state our criteria for selecting interviewees were their awareness of the acpf and their ability to provide technical social and or organizational insight about nrcs readiness to adopt the acpf initial interviewees were recruited in consultation with the larger team snowball sampling was used with the initial interviewees to identify additional interviewees patton 1990 interviews were conducted until no additional interviewees were identified twenty three semi structured interviews were conducted which involved a total of 27 individuals see tables 1 and 2 interviews were conducted in person and over the phone between december 2019 and april 2020 interviews ranged from 30 min to 90 min using a series of 26 questions that explored benefits and challenges associated with agency wide use of acpf among others questions explored topics around acpf s role in and contribution to conservation planning acpf adoption throughout the agency compatibility with other dsts and planning processes and education and training needs associated with the acpf all interviews were recorded and transcribed data analysis occurred in four stages 1 initial coding 2 intercoder reliability tests 3 final coding and 4 synthesis following church et al 2019b coding and intercoder reliability tests were conducted using nvivo 12 qsr international pty ltd doncaster australia one of the co authors reviewed interview transcripts and developed an initial codebook based on the interview guide three of the study authors read two transcripts and independently assigned interview content to relevant codes codes were added iteratively through the initial coding process resulting in codebook refinement after each transcript was coded an intercoder reliability test was conducted to assess initial levels of coding agreement the three study authors discussed coding disagreements until they agreed upon shared meanings of code definition once the final coding framework was established and agreed upon an intercoder reliability test was conducted on a subset of four interviews resulting in a cohen s kappa of 0 76 indicating adequate consistency between the three authors viera and garrett 2005 the remaining interviews were coded independently by two of the study authors finally four of the study authors including the three who participated in the intercoder reliability process synthesized coded interviews the synthesized data was interpreted in the context of doi and use of science theories and was structured around looking for instances when key concepts from the two theories were mentioned by the interviewees throughout the results we include representative quotations for each theme reported along with whether the interviewee worked in a current or novel state 5 results and discussion in this section we present organizational and individual level drivers of nrcs readiness to adopt the acpf the first half of the results section presents evidence in support of organizational capacity hierarchy and structure as it relates to nrcs readiness to adopt the acpf see table 3 the second half of the results section presents evidence in support of agency staff s knowledge and perceived characteristics of the acpf before we present the drivers of nrcs readiness we want to acknowledge that even among the states where acpf use has been relatively more frequent classified in our study as current states we found limited acpf awareness including its applications to conservation planning for example an interviewee from a current state mentioned even though acpf has been out for a number of years i think we need to do a better job of sort of teaching the nrcs leadership what this thing really is we just have to do a really good job of explaining the acpf so that they can get behind it and make it a priority for our field staff to be using the acpf we re not at that point yet here in our state 5 1 organizational level drivers of acpf 5 1 1 agency capacity interviewees from both current and novel states expressed several themes that were indicative of nrcs capacity or lack thereof to adopt the acpf nrcs s capacity to facilitate acpf adoption was expressed with respect to needs pertaining to research and technical infrastructure and personnel needs pertaining to agency research and technical infrastructure were expressed in terms of coding skills and infrastructure and the ability of the nrcs to ensure that states have access to lidar data which is required to run the acpf and generate results needs pertaining to research and technical infrastructure were expressed by several interviewees and are illustrated by the following quotes we don t have the skill in the agency we don t have the coding skills we don t have the coding infrastructure we don t have the computing power i don t see nrcs developing that kind of skill any time soon current state acpf has to be tuned to each watershed acpf tuning to the watershed and achieving coverage of lidar data i think those are big challenges and we re just not going to get full coverage anytime soon i think that s one of the challenges with it right now current state are we going to get lidar flown every year doubtful especially in these delta regions where you ve got the heaviest amount of farming going on how often are you going to get that lidar data novel state whereas the preceding quotes highlight agency level research and technical infrastructure needs pertaining to acpf adoption an interviewee acknowledged that housing the acpf within the nrcs will be key to acpf adoption illustrating this point an interviewee from a novel state mentioned if you get outside of the box with nrcs the possibility of a tool being integrated into the agency would be dramatically reduced i think it the acpf would have a higher chance of adoption within the nrcs if it were housed in nrcs and we had partners feeding into it needs pertaining to personnel that included hiring and training new staff and funding also emerged in our study interviewees frequently mentioned needs pertaining to personnel to facilitate acpf adoption for example highlighting the need for nrcs to hire staff who can deal with information technology it issues an interviewee from a current state mentioned i think where nrcs struggles a little is the funding aspect of staffing when it comes to it related technical issues it just seems like it s a very uphill battle with resources and resource allotment in that regard many interviewees from both current and novel states indicated that agency restructuring and staff retirement combined with administrative and technical changes further created a need for not only hiring staff but also bridging the knowledge and skill gaps among new staff the quotes below are illustrative of this theme a few years ago they nrcs consolidated to try to make things administrative functions consistent across the country but until that structure was in place they didn t hire people and then when the new administration came over they decided to do this across us nrcs and our sister agencies so now there is a fpac farm production and conservation business center which is a separate agency outside of nrcs that is to handle all of our hiring fpac is not directly in our chain of command so we can make upper leadership aware of our staffing issues but there s nothing really within our control to have that happen quicker novel state we re actually moving away from arcgis as our planning platform software and so one of my concerns is our arcgis skillset is going to diminish among our employees as we move to cd conservation desktop which is a web application current state knowledge deficits among newly hired staff combined with a lack of adequate training and a scenario where acpf specific training needs to be delivered across different organizational levels of nrcs were frequently discussed as barriers to its adoption the quotes below are illustrative of this theme just giving people a tool such as the acpf without actually walking them through how to use it that happens a lot where this thing comes down from the nrcs leadership we don t have adequate training but we re supposed to use it some people who are really motivated and interested use it but for everybody else it s one more thing on their plate and it doesn t get adopted novel state i would just say the way the organizational structure is if a lot of training is having to be delivered down between different levels like down from national and then to the state and then from the state down that would be a hindrance for acpf adoption novel state overall interviewees from both current and novel states suggest that nrcs capacity to adopt the acpf was affected by several factors that manifested as needs pertaining to research and technical infrastructure and personnel agency staff who are trained to run the acpf and have the time to do so combined with the agency providing funding support were additional factors related to nrcs readiness to adopt the acpf for example an interviewee from a current state mentioned the amount of time from data analysis all the way down to data delivery is a hurdle we need to figure out how to get around i think as an agency the interviewee further added that this will continue to be a hurdle unless we add some person with at least a quarter of their time is directly in their pd position description that says you re really doing acpf for the next five years or whatever the need for financial support was identified by multiple interviewees as a driver for acpf adoption and is illustrated by the following quote a lot of good science does not get implemented or applied because it doesn t have the financial resources to support it so we can run apcf but once it s done now we re talking about actually applying it and using it long term we need to build financial capacity to be able to maintain it novel state 5 1 2 agency hierarchy and structure rogers 1995 411 identifies several variables that are positively and negatively related to organizational innovativeness as described below we found several of these variables pertaining to nrcs hierarchy and structure which enabled and hindered nrcs readiness to adopt the acpf a champions across organizational levels rogers doi theory establishes the role of change agents and champions in positively influencing adoption of innovations in our study individuals holding specific designations within the nrcs emerged as those who could play the role of champions expressing this theme an interviewee mentioned key nrcs positions that could help facilitate acpf adoption are conservation planners our soil conservationists and our resource conservationists at the field level if you had their buy in across the state there would be nothing stopping the tool from being adopted current state in addition to emphasizing the role of champions in promoting the acpf the aforementioned quote highlights the importance of field level staff endorsing the acpf a reference to field level staff by the interviewee also highlights the fact that nrcs is a multi level organization and how these levels can be leveraged to promote the acpf in similar vein endorsement of the acpf from nrcs national leadership was identified as a point of leverage to promote the acpf by a majority of interviewees from both current and novel states the following quotes are illustrative of this theme i think if the agency at the national level is supportive of the use of a tool like the acpf that certainly helps facilitate the adoption and use within the states current state if you find the right person at nrcs headquarters who can promote acpf and be the leader or champion they sell the program to the state conservationists who sell it to us line of staff people and then we sell it to the field so if we wanted to really be successful that s the route you d have to take current state local offices could implement something but ultimately if the acpf is going to tie together with any of our other programs and our other tools it ll have to be at a higher leadership level to be able to make it work together novel state taken together our findings suggest that acpf endorsement and promotion needs to occur from both top down and bottom up directions across the nrcs and that individuals holding specific designations across different levels of the agency can play an important role in promoting the use of acpf by acting as champions of the innovation b agency openness partners as enablers of nrcs readiness to adopt the acpf rogers 1995 408 defines system openness as the degree to which the members of a system are linked to other individuals who are external to the system this doi construct is positively related to organizational innovativeness in our study interviewees frequently identified partners and organizations external to the nrcs as key enablers of nrcs readiness to adopt the acpf from a theoretical perspective this is indicative of nrcs openness to working with external entities to facilitate acpf adoption interviewees frequently acknowledged the role partners can play in enabling nrcs to overcome their staffing and outreach capacities and therefore overcome barriers to acpf adoption the following quotes are illustrative of this theme the two acpf projects that we have going on right now are partner initiated local swcd and a nonprofit organization so partners i think are critical especially given all of the challenges that we have as an agency critical for actually doing the number crunching and for working with the local groups to promote the output current state we ve trained our employees and our partners where we re attempting to expand efforts pertaining to the acpf with our partners because again it s more than just what nrcs can do current state while novel states have not yet established partnerships to promote the acpf most novel state interviewees echoed current state s emphasis on the importance of partnerships to enable acpf adoption the following quote illustrates this theme for us our state s water quality partnership they re going to be a key stakeholder partner in terms of adoption non adoption would be our state s water quality partnership not supporting the tool novel state a few interviewees also felt that partners should be included in agency driven conversations around the acpf which in turn can enable nrcs readiness to adopt the acpf for example an interviewee from a current state mentioned the epas united states environmental protection agency of the world and the state environmental agencies also need to see these acpf generated products and then be part of this conversation as well on how do we get more of this acpf across the nation c agency centralization rogers 1995 412 defines centralization as the degree to which power and control in a system are concentrated in the hands of a relatively few individuals this doi construct is negatively related to organizational innovativeness in our study narratives around agency control and power emerged in the context of nrcs being a top down agency and bureaucratic challenges imposed by other organizations and offices within the usda e g fpac it etc as a result of these factors multiple interviewees in our study felt that their decision making abilities are constrained the following quotes are illustrative of this theme we seem to have this thing where we get something and we have no idea what it is or we re told something s coming top down from nrcs leadership and it s delivered and then all of a sudden it s like oh this is what this is and this is how you use it and getting the cart before the horse on that kind of stuff current state fpac business center handles all the administrative stuff they handle all the dollars they handle all the personnel they handle hiring it is its own branch it controls a lot of the tech a lot of the computer equipment a lot of the software a lot of the security things a lot of the network and those things are all significant we are constantly trying to work around constraints that they put on us in the name of security but sometimes it s a little too much current state given that power and control rested with the national leadership current state interviewees felt that agency staff holding leadership positions should overcome inertia and a tendency to maintain the status quo which in turn can then facilitate acpf adoption challenges related to status quo bias were not discussed by novel state interviewees as these states are in the early stages of exploring how the acpf can be used in their state the following quotes are illustrative of this theme discussed by several current state interviewees i can tell you what s hindered acpf adoption in the past and that s just that decision makers are so unbelievably busy it s just hard for them to see it just with everything else they the national leadership team have going on it was just too much too many things happening and i think that s kind of a barrier current state there s just so much inertia at the national level towards getting the acpf speared i like acpf i think it s really powerful but there s so much inertia at the higher levels current state d agency formalization rogers 1995 412 defines formalization as the degree to which an organization emphasizes its members follow rules and procedures this doi construct is negatively related to organizational innovativeness in our study the agency s emphasis on following rules and procedures emerged in the context of how acpf might interface with nrcs programmatic constraints and requirements however these constraints and requirements were not only driven by the nrcs but also other organizations and offices within the usda and the overall bureaucratic and political context this theme was expressed by a few interviewees and is illustrated by the following quotes this is not a technical issue it s a programmatic issue but one way to promote acpf is if we had the ability to say you re only eligible for the program if you have a conservation plan that s been prior prepared but congress won t let us do that the program rules the farm bill rules the political pressures the agency infrastructure prevent us from taking that hard and fast stance current state i guess i don t know how acpf would work on a field by field basis especially when our field definitions change based on fsa farm service agency and a lot of that plays into the subsidies the fsa does and field boundaries change based on that kind of stuff and i just i don t know how that acpf would work when that stuff changes regularly current state agency emphasis on following rules and procedures also emerged in the context of conservation planning being limited to the list of bmps that are approved by the nrcs for example an interviewee from a current state mentioned a bureaucratic limitation is that conservation planning is limited to our practice list that s just how nrcs thinks of things because those are essentially the bullets we have to address these things resource concerns an emphasis on following rules and procedures resulted in agency staff having limited time to deliver programs and practices to farmers for example an interviewee from a current state mentioned this year is a great example in that we haven t even really announced any of our programs yet because we re waiting on final rules from the farm bill to be posted and interpretation of rules as a result of which we have a short time frame to get programs delivered in a normal year 5 2 individual level drivers of acpf rogers 1995 170 model of five stages of the innovation decision process provided a useful theoretical grounding for the themes expressed by interviewees in our study the first two stages in the innovation decision process are the knowledge stage and the persuasion stage as per rogers 1995 171 the knowledge stage commences when an individual is exposed to an innovation s existence and gains an understanding of how it functions at the persuasion stage an individual forms a favorable or unfavorable attitude towards the innovation rogers 1995 174 interviewees in our study expressed several themes that fit within the knowledge and persuasion stages of the innovation decision process as described below in detail these themes provide a nuanced understanding of factors that can facilitate or hinder nrcs readiness to adopt the acpf from the perspective of an individual 5 2 1 the knowledge stage rogers 1995 173 identifies three types of knowledge about an innovation awareness knowledge how to knowledge and principles knowledge awareness knowledge primarily focuses on an individual s awareness that an innovation exists how to knowledge primarily consists of the information an individual needs to use an innovation properly principles knowledge primarily consists of information that helps an individual understand the functioning principles underlying how an innovation works a awareness knowledge interviewees in our study expressed that the overall awareness of the acpf was low and that there was a need to impart awareness knowledge by including acpf modules in agency delivered planning courses and trainings and by developing a narrative promoting the acpf low awareness knowledge was expressed by several interviewees and is evident in the following quote from a current state interviewee other than a few people in this office there s very little awareness of what acpf is so they field office staff and nrcs partners would recognize the usefulness of the tools if they were provided with some explanation this interviewee and many others felt that a useful medium for increasing acpf awareness was to include acpf modules in area wide planning courses they mentioned a year ago i had area wide planning course a great course but it did not include acpf in it when i talked to the instructors about it they were aware of the acpf but it wasn t on their radar to include it that would be a key thing if they start teaching it low levels of acpf awareness and the need to develop a narrative to promote it is evident in the following quotes from both current and novel state interviewees just making people aware of what it acpf actually is it s not writing the conservation plan for anybody but it s a support piece making sure they field office staff and nrcs partners understand that so if we can get that sales piece telling them what it s all about that s probably the biggest hurdle we have right now current state as long as we can show how it s going to help better get conservation on the ground target conservation and maybe help our people be more efficient and streamlined i think everybody will buy into it novel state b how to and principles knowledge it is logical that low acpf awareness knowledge would translate into low how to and principles knowledge among agency staff indeed interviewees felt that there was a need to train agency staff in both basic and advanced functionalities of the acpf however the need for imparting these two knowledge dimensions among agency staff was nuanced many interviewees recognized that staff who work at the field level should be knowledgeable about the basic functionalities of the acpf the following quotes are illustrative of this theme as long as our new staff understand what those tools are doing and what the outputs of those tools mean i think there would be a very significant asset to our planning efforts current state the other need is to train the field office in what the acpf generated output maps mean and how to access them and how to print them out and how to fill them that s not a high level training you need current state whereas these quotes reflect the need for field level staff to have the basic how to knowledge pertaining to the acpf several interviewees felt that they did not need training in advanced acpf functionalities i e understanding the functioning principles underlying how the acpf works the following quotes are illustrative of this theme we want to go to the field staff and say hey here s how to effectively use this tool rather than hey help us figure out how to effectively use this tool they don t have time to go through that learning process they have to learn something and use it rather than what i call the discovery phase if you will of a new technology current state field staff will also need acpf training it probably wouldn t be the inner workings of the tool i think what they would need to know is okay this is what s been done in the background of running this report here s the information presented how do i use it what is it useful for novel state our results highlight underlying nuances in promoting adoption of an innovation when the decision making unit is an organization as mentioned earlier see section 2 intended users of an innovation within and organization are not homogeneous therefore their knowledge needs for effectively using an innovation are different as our findings indicate for effective use of the acpf field staff should have awareness and how to knowledge about the acpf in contrast agency staff such as gis specialists who use the acpf for example to generate datasets might need to be knowledgeable about the functioning principles of how the acpf works and therefore also have principles knowledge 5 2 2 the persuasion stage the main outcome of the persuasion stage in the innovation decision process is an individual forming a positive or a negative attitude towards the innovation rogers 1995 at this stage the five perceived attributes of the innovation relative advantage compatibility complexity trialability and observability are especially important in an individual developing a favorable or unfavorable attitude towards the innovation perceived scientific credibility of the acpf is another factor that could potentially affect agency staff s attitudes which in turn can then influence their decision to use or not to use the acpf a relative advantage rogers 1995 229 defined relative advantage as the degree to which an innovation is perceived as being better than the idea it supersedes a few interviewees in our study recognized the relative advantages of the acpf while reflecting upon their experiences of using existing models within the nrcs the quotes below are illustrative of this theme acpf would give us something that we don t have right now the model i used last year i could calculate overall tons in a watershed of sediment loss and nutrients loss but then i didn t have anything to show like critical zones or anything like that novel state i think acpf is actually a more useful tool for planning than what we re getting with cart conservation assessment ranking tool which is not looking at specific locations for conservation practices it s more looking at whether or not that practice is planned on that field novel state relative advantage of an innovation indicates the benefits associated with its adoption the anticipated benefits associated with using the acpf was expressed along several dimensions by multiple interviewees in our study one such dimension was acpf s role in watershed assessment and planning specifically with respect to making the process efficient and enabling effective generation of solutions the quotes below are illustrative of this theme the value of acpf is it is one of the first tools that does allow us to get a good picture of a watershed or a landscape and actually see it in a very efficient way and quickly and on that large of a scale current state in the past we would generate all this map output and we have all these really great pieces of information but they didn t really talk to each other never really we could bring everything together to come up with better answers and that s where i think acpf would fit current state other dimensions of anticipated benefits frequently highlighted by interviewees pertained to the acpf acting as a means to help new agency staff gain an understanding of the watershed context and resulting in social outcomes such as improving the stakeholder engagement process specifically benefits pertaining to stakeholder engagement were expressed in light of informing agency s education and outreach efforts and subsequently channelizing resources specifically towards farmers and farms where they could be most effective the following quotes are illustrative of the aforementioned themes acpf would allow us to say this part of the county is where all of our drainage water management bmps would apply let s hold the training there let s target our efforts on these farmers where our outreach effort is going to apply best and be the most effective current state i think acpf has the ability to give a newly hired planner sit down and use it before they ve actually met with the producer on their farm i think that may accelerate the learning curve and give them a lot of confidence when they re talking to the producer current state as far as engaging the farmers i think it the acpf gives us an opportunity to provide them information describe what we think is going on as far as why is the water quality declining or how can we solve this problem and then giving them the method and the financial assistance to do that novel state overall our findings indicate that acpf has high relative advantage which stem from acpf bringing in improved functionalities to the watershed assessment and planning process and by providing multi dimensional benefits agency staff perceiving that the acpf has high relative advantage could encourage them to use it b compatibility rogers 1995 240 defined compatibility as the degree to which an innovation is perceived as consistent with the existing values past experiences and needs of potential adopters similarly mcnie 2007 p 19 and cash et al 2003 identify the salience of a scientific product to a potential user who sees it is compatible with their information needs as important from the perspective of an organization compatibility is especially important in relation to the degree to which an innovation is perceived to be compatible with the policies programs and processes that are in place within an organization broadly compatibility was discussed with respect to how the acpf could fit within nrcs current approach to conservation planning and program delivery specifically compatibility was discussed in the context of acpf supporting current landscape scale nrcs initiatives such as the mississippi river basin initiative mrbi national water quality initiative nwqi and regional conservation partnership program rcpp the acpf was also perceived by several interviewees to be compatible with nrcs programmatic goals and objectives for example by assisting in accomplishing policy directives around prioritizing funding at the regional state and local level the quotes listed below are illustrative of the aforementioned themes i would say just the structure right now under programs such as nwqi and mrbi where we have to develop a watershed assessment and then use that to request funding i think that structure leads us to need programs like the acpf novel state well the specific programs like our eqip well actually every program csp conservation stewardship program our crp conservation reserve program our wetland reserve easements those conservation opportunities through acpf could help identify and prioritize and target opportunities for all our programs current state acpf was also perceived to be compatible with nrcs nine step conservation planning process a key agency approach to conservation planning and program delivery under this process the agency helps farmers develop a conservation plan which is a schedule of implementation and supporting information maps designs fact sheets etc for bmps needed to treat one or more identified natural resource concerns on a unit of land see appendix 2 many interviewees frequently identified specific steps of the conservation planning process where acpf could be useful for example an interviewee from a novel state mentioned i think the acpf is going to assist us step one identify problems and opportunities and step four which is analyze resource data step seven make decisions and then also step eight is implement the plan step nine is evaluate the plan i think that s where acpf is going to really work whereas the acpf was perceived to be compatible with the nine step conservation planning process several interviewees also discussed the need for acpf to be compatible with existing dsts platforms and processes the following quotes are illustrative of this theme what i don t understand is how acpf is going to interface with what we re doing with cd and cart and some new tools that our agency s coming out with current state if acpf is determined to be valuable to the agency as a whole having it built into conservation desktop or cart as an option to run the acpf within our normal planning and assessment and ranking process i think would be very valuable current state whereas several themes emerged around how and why the acpf was perceived to be compatible several interviewees also discussed why acpf might not be compatible within certain geographic contexts in this light perceived in compatibility was discussed with respect to the need to account for diversity in geographic contexts and their unique needs as well as the type of bmps that might be applicable in a given context while both current and novel state interviewees mentioned this potential challenge this theme was more prevalent in novel states as these states are outside the original geographic scope the upper midwest of the acpf the following quotes are illustrative of this theme acpf is really geared toward cropland we re a state that s two thirds grassland and forest the long term goal would be try to develop acpf to where it better fits our state than just the midwest novel state one of the obstacles that comes with the acpf is if there are things specific to our state s landscape that the model doesn t take into account that may place practices and locations that just aren t suitable that could be a detriment if it happened novel state within our state there wasn t a vast number of practices generated by the acpf that i recall that really were applicable here obviously filter strips field borders those types of things would be relevant to our state however some of the other practices like bio reactors are not current state overall our findings indicate that acpf was perceived to be compatible with the organizational context of the nrcs especially in relation with their policies programs and processes however there was also a need for the acpf to account for different geographies and their unique needs in order it to be applicable more widely c complexity rogers 1995 257 defined complexity as the degree to which an innovation is perceived as relatively difficult to understand and use complexity emerged as a cross cutting theme i e discussions around the complex nature of the acpf emerged in the context of several of the aforementioned themes for example indicating how personnel needs and capacity might intersect with the time needed to run the acpf an interviewee from a current state mentioned acpf is complicated enough that i don t know that having someone in every office being able to use it is a realistic thing complexities pertaining to using the acpf often emerged at the intersection of the staffing capacity needed to run the toolbox and the need to make acpf input and output data applicable to the local context the following quotes are illustrative of this theme mentioned by a majority of interviewees you ve got to do some conditioning of that dem digital elevation model and digitizing the culverts to get the water running right because acpf is really that stream network so getting that hydro conditioned dem correct is pretty critical so obviously that s a huge obstacle for anybody to turnaround the acpf current state it would be more than a full time job just to do acpf and just to keep running it and make watersheds and it s not just a matter of automating a process and spitting out the answers for the whole state i mean we could do that but we re not really capturing the identity of each watershed when we do that current state whereas the aforementioned quotes highlight the complexities pertaining to using the acpf the need to deliver training across different organizational levels of nrcs see section 5 1 1 was indicative of the complexities pertaining to understanding the acpf taken together complexities around understanding and using the acpf could deter agency staff from adopting it d trialability and observability rogers 1995 258 defined trialability as the degree to which an innovation may be experimented with on a limited basis and observability as the degree to which the results of an innovation are visible to others as such quotes illustrating trialability and observability only emerged in two current states and were therefore not considered to be recurring themes in our study nevertheless our initial findings suggest the need for nrcs field offices to pilot the acpf assess whether or not the tool provides its intended benefits and have an opportunity to provide feedback regarding potential improvements highlighting these points one interviewee from a current state mentioned if we can t pilot the acpf and our people in the field office can t give feedback on it it won t be successful adding further nuances to their response the interview mentioned we ve got to put some of our better field offices and see if it s a tool that really adds value and then listen to those folks very very closely as to what value it adds and what it doesn t that s the thing that i think leadership has to guard against is that they new tools actually add value at the field level more than anything else current state in addition to highlighting the importance of trialing the acpf at the field office level the aforementioned quote highlights the need for the acpf to add value i e have tangible benefits tangibility of results and that results are observable by others are important components of the doi construct of observability the quotes below are illustrative of this acpf responds to demand from partners that are wanting to do watershed planning but need the technical support so if there s success or success stories out there of how acpf has helped them in practice and others see that and say we want this in our watershed or our county so we can use your dollars effectively that could motivate a state conservationist through a state technical committee to adopt the acpf current state if we have people at that field level that are showing how they used it to actually put conservation on the ground that s where you need to be to promote the acpf you need to be able to show we did a cost share with this farmer and it was partly because of the fact that we are using these new tools to help with showing a farmer his property on a map current state e perceived scientific credibility mcnie 2007 and cash et al 2003 point out the impact of the perceived validity and credibility of a scientific product on its use for example if an innovation is perceived to be science based and therefore valid and credible agency staff are likely to develop a favorable attitude towards it a key outcome of the persuasion stage in doi theory a positive attitude can then foster use of acpf by agency staff most interviewees in our study felt that acpf was grounded in science and that using a scientific tool further added credibility to agency staff when working with farmers the following quotes are illustrative of this theme acpf is science based one of the most important things that goes into acpf is that it s got excellent science behind it that i think is one of the most important parts of it current state the relationship the farmer has with the conservation planner and their credibility is critical when you re going out to the farm and you say i think this particular area s a critical point for you to address in addition to my findings if i had a map that was done by a scientific tool such as the acpf that came up with the same conclusion that gives me that much more credibility novel state other interviewees reiterated the importance of ensuring that the results generated by the acpf were validated in order to enhance its trustworthiness applicability and usefulness for example an interviewee from a current state mentioned validating the data making sure it s applicable it s efficient it s easy to use i think all those things culminate in the adoption of acpf using a cautionary tone the interviewee further added my overarching pause is making certain that tools like the acpf and other models are calibrated and validated so that at the end of the day we have a resource that we can trust and that the research community can say yes this tool is as accurate as we can make it with the resources that we have today expressing the importance of validating acpf data an interviewee from a current state mentioned if you run acpf for every watershed what is your plan for verifying those results without that it s not going to be very useful to sum up our theoretically grounded enquiry confirmed many elements of doi and use of science theories and in doing so helped answer the following question of practical importance how ready is the nrcs to adopt the acpf we found that several organizational and individual level factors influenced nrcs readiness to adopt the acpf see table 3 the following organizational and individual level factors were predominantly positive indicators of nrcs readiness to adopt the acpf champions across organizational levels agency openness relative advantage and perceived scientific credibility the following organizational and individual level factors were predominantly negative indicators of nrcs readiness to adopt the acpf agency capacity agency centralization agency formalization level of acpf knowledge and complexity compatibility emerged as a factor that affected acpf adoption both positively and negatively 6 conclusions agricultural dsts are a type of innovation that is increasingly becoming the norm in conservation planning however owing to the complex nature of the innovation decision process in an organization limited scholarly attention has been paid to assessing organizational readiness for innovation in order to fulfill this knowledge gap we drew upon theories of doi and the use of science to examine organizational and individual level factors that could enable or deter the nrcs to adopt the acpf semi structured interviews conducted with nrcs staff holding leadership positions resulted in an in depth descriptive illustration of the agency s readiness to adopt the acpf as well as several theoretical and practical insights our finding that nrcs readiness to adopt the acpf was an outcome of both organizational and individual level factors finds support in scholarship around the theory of organizational readiness for change orc gustafson et al 2003 weiner 2009 lokuge et al 2019 the consolidated framework for implementation research keith et al 2017 miake lye et al 2020 and findings from doi and use of science theories rogers 1995 ouimet at al 2009 for example as per orc organizational readiness is an outcome of an organization s commitment to change referred as change valance adequacy of resources necessary to implement the change referred as change efficacy and contextual factors such as having flexible organizational strategies and partnerships lokuge et al 2019 the orc also highlights the importance of assessing staff s perceptions of an organization s push for change kelly et al 2017 confirming the aforementioned theories and frameworks we also found that nrcs readiness to change and use the acpf was a function of agency staff s perceptions of the organization and the innovation and the broader organizational context a novel theoretical contribution of this study is the demonstration of synergies between doi and use of science theories when organizations prepare to adopt an innovation that is a scientific product a host of factors come into play while use of science theory does recognize agency personnel as working within agencies doi theory brings a more nuanced treatment of agency characteristics such as champions external partnerships centralization and formality doi theory also highlights specific elements of the innovation itself not included in use of science theory such as relative advantage complexity trialability and observability on the other hand use of science theory calls attention to the credibility of the scientific product as a critical factor which is a key focus of the scientific method and a theme that emerged from our data an important overlap between the two theories is the doi factor compatibility which is essentially the same concept as salience in the use of science literature finally studies grounded in the use of science theory highlight an important factor not highlighted by doi research legitimacy of the process of creating the scientific product legitimacy did not emerge as a key factor in the adoption of the acpf which is an unexpected result and worth further inquiry several of our findings are supported by the current literature for example acpf s relative advantages of improving stakeholder engagement and acting as a medium for agency staff to gain an understanding of their watershed have been documented in the current literature ranjan et al 2019 zimmerman et al 2019 perceived scientific credibility and compatibility of an innovation are other themes from our study that are supported by the current literature as documented in the literature around use of science in order to foster uptake of science by civil servants the scientific information should not only be perceived as credible but it should also be applicable to the local context koontz 2019 we found that the acpf was perceived as credible by agency staff however they also felt that the acpf should account for different geographies and their unique needs to make the findings from the acpf locally applicable whereas a strong theoretical foundation allows us to test doi and use of science theories by applying it in the novel context of nrcs a key question remains what do our findings mean for the nrcs several of the individual level themes in our study fall under the knowledge and persuasion stages of rogers innovation decision process rogers 1995 170 conceptualizing nrcs as the decision making unit this is indicative of the agency being in the initial stages of getting ready to adopt the acpf i e gaining knowledge which then translates into forming an attitude towards the innovation moreover the fact that trialability and observability did not emerge as recurring themes in our study indicates that agency staff are still forming an attitude towards the acpf from a practical standpoint this highlights the need for nrcs to continue to invest resources towards piloting the acpf in different watersheds and measuring both social and bio physical outcomes to aid observability doing so could help the agency move further along rogers next three stages of the innovation decision process decision implementation and confirmation rogers 1995 170 several of the organizational level themes we found constitute internal and external characteristics of the nrcs documented by rogers 1995 411 and ouimet et al 2009 337 from the perspective of the process of adopting an innovation or incorporating science into decisions interviewees expressing several research and technical infrastructure and personnel needs see section 5 1 1 indicates that the agency is currently in the initiation phase of the innovation process rogers 1995 421 indeed the ability of the acpf to foster a small watershed approach konopacky and ristino 2017 and perhaps engender a fundamental shift in nrcs conservation planning approach fits with the following two stages within the initiation phase of the innovation process agenda setting and matching rogers 1995 421 from the perspective of orc this is also indicative of nrcs commitment to change referred as change valance lokuge et al 2019 however our finding that agency staff are still in the stage of forming an attitude towards the acpf suggests the need to prioritize efforts towards piloting the acpf and measuring social and bio physical outcomes as per rogers 1995 412 an organization emphasizing that its members follow rules and procedures formalization can inhibit the consideration of innovation by organization members but encourage the implementation of innovations we found that programmatic constraints and requirements discouraged interviewees from considering the acpf however an agency emphasizing that rules and procedures are followed can also result in a structure that encourages the adoption of innovations for example acpf s compatibility with nrcs nine step conservation planning process a rule oriented structured process that facilitates conservation planning can encourage agency staff to adopt the acpf similarly we found that the agency structure can create opportunities for acpf endorsement and promotion to occur from both top down and bottom up directions organizational structure can also enable members to gain access to each other s expertise and perhaps create an organizational milieu that helps them overcome their initial perceptions regarding the value of the innovation and therefore encourage adoption in the longer run frank et al 2004 therefore whereas rules and procedures can initially impede agency staff to consider the acpf in the longer run agency structure can also enable acpf adoption like all studies this one has limitations for example as pointed out by rogers 1995 one could question how well the perceptions of staff holding leadership positions represent those of staff at the field level while we acknowledge this limitation including interview data from field staff was beyond the objectives and scope of this study we would also like to acknowledge that selection of initial interviewees in consultation with the larger team could have resulted in selection of interviewees especially those from current states who might have had a more favorable attitude towards the acpf that said we took steps such as carefully wording interview questions and running intercoder reliability tests to negate any underlying biases another limitation of our study design is that we are unable to make any claims about the relative significance of any given driver of nrcs readiness to adopt the acpf and the generalizability of our findings beyond the nrcs that said being a multi level organization a type of organizational structure common to many government agencies ngos and non profits the nrcs provided us with a fitting platform to test theories around organizational readiness for innovation by doing so our hope is that we are able to inform agency level discussions around adoption of dsts lastly we would like to acknowledge that due to the limitations of our research design we are not able to compare and contrast findings across different state i e novel versus current and interviewee types e g leadership versus field staff indeed no systematic differences across state and interviewee types emerged in our study future research could use quantitative approaches to identify drivers of organizational readiness their relative importance and any variations across geography and respondent designations and roles by employing an exploratory approach we were able to identify and describe organizational and individual level factors that could both enable or deter the nrcs from adopting the acpf in doing so we confirmed what we had initially postulated i e agency staffs perceptions of the organization and the scientific innovation will collectively influence their decision to adopt or reject the acpf overall our findings suggest that nrcs is currently in the initiation phase of the innovation process with agency staff still forming an attitude towards the acpf both these factors indicate that the agency is getting ready for change but there is a need to invest resources towards piloting the acpf and measuring outcomes and helping agency staff overcome both real and perceived barriers to adopting the acpf credit authorship contribution statement pranay ranjan conceptualization methodology validation writing original draft writing review editing funding acquisition emily m usher

3616,decision support tools dsts are a type of innovation that can facilitate science based decision making including nonpoint source pollution management in agricultural watersheds however organizational readiness for adopting innovations is a topic that has received limited attention in the literature with the goal of filling this knowledge gap we draw upon the diffusion of innovations doi theory and literature around use of science by agency staff to assess united states department of agriculture natural resources conservation services usda nrcs readiness towards using the agricultural conservation planning framework acpf a type of dst to that end we conducted 23 semi structured in depth interviews with 27 nrcs staff holding leadership positions to explore how they perceive and use the acpf and their perceptions of organizational and structural elements that could enable or hinder nrcs readiness to adopt the acpf results suggest that nrcs readiness was an outcome of both organizational and individual level factors factors such as perceived scientific credibility and the influential role of leaders positively influenced nrcs readiness however factors such as low levels of acpf knowledge and perceived complexity negatively influenced nrcs readiness overall our findings suggest that nrcs is in the initial stages of getting ready to adopt the acpf and that there is a need for the agency to pilot acpf in different watersheds and measure social and bio physical outcomes keywords agricultural conservation planning framework diffusion innovations watershed assessment semi structured interviews organizational readiness 1 introduction the agriculture sector is replete with innovations ranging from those that were developed in the 1940 s e g hybrid corn to those that are relatively more recent e g precision agricultural technologies a hybrid corn study conducted several decades ago laid down the foundations for the diffusion of innovations doi theory and also established that diffusion is fundamentally a social process wherein innovations are adopted through subjective evaluations e g perceived norms rather than solely by economic rational decision making valente and rogers 1995 subsequently the scholarship around and applications of the doi theory has burgeoned to examine many elements of the diffusion process including the adopter i e the individual or decision making unit the change agent i e an individual who influences the adopter and the attributes of the innovation itself e g complexity of the innovation ranjan and witter 2020 rogers 1995 however an aspect of diffusion of innovations that has received limited attention in the literature is organizational readiness for innovation lokuge et al 2019 in particular scholars have identified the need for research around the steps that organizations can take to assess and anticipate the impacts of an innovation greenhalgh et al 2004 619 the innovation decision process is considered to be much more complex when the unit of adoption is an organization versus an individual rogers 1995 therefore as pointed out by rogers 1995 402 once an organization has made a decision to adopt implementation does not follow directly in a similar vein the fact that approximately 90 of new ideas never convert to new product or service deliveries because of the lack of organizational readiness further underscores the complexity of the innovation decision process when the unit of adoption is an organization lokuge et al 2019 445 the complexity of understanding organizational readiness to adopt an innovation motivated us to assess the united states department of agriculture natural resources conservation services usda nrcs henceforth nrcs readiness towards using the agricultural conservation planning framework acpf nrcs provided the context see section 3 1 for further details to assess organizational readiness to adopt whereas the acpf a scientific arcgis based decision support tool dst that helps semi automate the process of identifying field specific locations for placement of agricultural best management practices bmps within hydrologic unit code 12 huc 12 watersheds tomer et al 2015a ranjan et al 2019 was the innovation of interest see section 3 2 for further details whereas understanding organizational readiness provided a theoretical rationale for our study it was also motivated by an increasing level of interest within the nrcs to use tools like the acpf to spatially prioritize conservation planning efforts and redefine how resources are allocated indeed owing to the fairly recent availability of lidar based elevation data acpf can foster a small watershed approach wherein the hydrology of a huc 12 watershed can be analyzed as a whole to identify and prioritize hydrologic flow paths and critical source areas konopacky and ristino 2017 at a huc 12 watershed scale acpf marks the first time that the nrcs could easily and cost effectively prioritize their conservation efforts and therefore move away from the currently dominant approach of random acts of conservation knight 2005 137a however this perhaps fundamental shift is contingent upon nrcs readiness to change dsts such as the acpf are designed to facilitate effective science based decision making by intended users who in the context of our study are the managers and staff working for the nrcs however understanding and subsequently promoting the use of science by civil servants in government agencies hereafter agency staff is a complex endeavor agency staff s decision to adopt or reject a scientific innovation can be influenced by both organizational level factors e g agency research infrastructure and push for recruitment and skill development and individual level factors e g agency staff s prior knowledge and their perceptions of attributes of the innovation relative advantage compatibility complexity trialability observability and credibility ouimet et al 2009 rogers 1995 whereas organizational level factors can help gauge nrcs readiness towards using the acpf individual level factors can help reveal pathways that enable agency staff to overcome real and perceived barriers to using the acpf taken together these factors help unravel the organizational context within which an innovation can be adopted as such use of science has been studied in myriad contexts including the use of climate science by usda field staff and their readiness willingness and ability to act as climate advisors for farmers prokopy et al 2013 wiener et al 2020 and use of science in collaborative governance processes to inform ecosystem recovery planning efforts koontz 2019 in a similar vein the doi theory has been applied in many contexts including adoption of innovations by both individuals and organizations rogers 1995 and the development of the consolidated framework for implementation research a framework that includes doi constructs to help guide effective implementation of innovations in organizations keith et al 2017 consolidated framework for implementation research n d however what is missing in the current scholarship is using doi and use of science theories together to holistically examine organizational and individual level factors that can enable or hinder organizational innovation with the goal of using theory to assess nrcs readiness towards a fundamental shift in conservation planning we present findings from semi structured interviews conducted with nrcs staff holding leadership positions owing to technical advancements in conservation science including the use of computer simulations to develop agricultural models and usda supported collaborative initiatives such as the conservation effects assessment project agricultural dsts are increasingly becoming the norm rather than exception in conservation planning mason et al 2021 ranjan et al 2020a therefore there is an urgent need to understand and assess organizational readiness to embrace innovations such as the acpf which has the potential to encourage watershed thinking among agricultural stakeholders and expedite the process of conservation planning ranjan et al 2019 ranjan et al 2020b 2 study conceptualization there are three key components in our study 1 acpf the scientific innovation under consideration 2 nrcs the multi level organization within which the acpf is intended to be adopted and 3 agency staff the intended users of the acpf who work for the nrcs in order to theoretically contextualize our data we draw upon ouimet et al s 2009 conceptual framework on absorption of research knowledge by civil servants see figure 1 337 and rogers 1995 model of five stages in the innovation decision process see figure 5 1 170 and variables related to organizational innovativeness see figure 10 2 411 1 1 for a visual of the three figures please refer appendix 1 by integrating elements of two theoretical perspectives doi and use of science we are able to holistically examine organizational and individual level factors that can help us assess nrcs readiness for adopting the acpf drawing upon the influential work by weiner 2009 we conceptualize organizational readiness to be an outcome of agency staffs perception of nrcs commitment to change e g nrcs investing resources to fulfill acpf data requirements and their perceived efficacy to use the acpf referred to as change efficacy bringing together the two aforementioned theoretical perspectives and our definition of organizational readiness we postulate that agency staffs perceptions of the organization i e nrcs and the scientific innovation i e acpf will collectively influence their decision regarding whether or not and the degree to which findings from the acpf are incorporated into decision making e g development of conservation plans agency staffs decision about incorporating the acpf into their decision making is characterized as use of science in our study as pointed out by ouimet et al 2009 incorporating science in decision making involves several interconnected steps such as recognizing the value of information acquiring the information evaluating the information and finally applying the information these steps in the context of doi theory roughly translate to the five stages of the innovation decision process knowledge persuasion decision implementation and confirmation rogers 1995 170 doi theory goes on to identify several characteristics of the potential adopter and the innovation that affect likelihood of adoption rogers 1995 weiner 2009 in parallel use of science theory has identified several characteristics of the potential user and the science product that affect likelihood of use cash et al 2003 mcnie 2007 ouimet et al 2009 taken together the two theoretical perspectives highlight the factors and the decision making processes that come into play when a decision making unit readies itself to adopt an innovation we would like to acknowledge that the intended users of an innovation and the ways in which the innovation is put to use are not homogeneous within an organization for instance a set of agency staff e g gis specialists might interface more with the technical side of the acpf by running the acpf toolbox and generating datasets whereas another set of agency staff e g district conservationists might interface more with the socio technical side of the acpf by presenting acpf generated maps to farmers and explaining the technical and bio physical aspects of conservation planning for their farm making this role based distinction is important because it not only affects the ways in which an innovation is put to use but it could also affect agency staffs perceptions of barriers towards its adoption in their organization for example gis staff might perceive a need for the nrcs to support technical trainings and dataset preparation whereas field staff might perceive a need for the nrcs to support socio technical trainings that help them convey the technical aspects of conservation planning to farmers 3 innovation diffusion context the organization and the innovation 3 1 nrcs the organization the nrcs along with the farm production and conservation fpac business center farm service agency fsa and the risk management agency rma is housed within the usda to meet its farm production and conservation mission in order to fulfill this mission these agencies interact to mitigate risks provide conservation programs and technical assistance and deliver financial programs to farmers usda 2021 the nrcs also partners with other local city and county governments soil and water conservation districts swcds state state departments of agriculture resource management etc and federal u s fish and wildlife epa etc organizations to fulfill its mission the organizational structure of the nrcs flows from a national level to the field office level program development large scale funding priorities and goals are established at the national level which is then channeled to regional offices across the united states which serve as leadership representatives of the chief conservationist in washington dc nrcs 2021a at the state level state conservationist offices provide state specific management and directives to support administrative and technical functions for coordinating and implementing natural resource conservation often including public and private entities nrcs 2021b the nrcs and fsa have multiple field offices within each state that serve as the main points of contact for farmers the nrcs and fsa work in conjunction with local swcds to provide services to farmers for technical assistance financial and commodity programs field office organization varies state by state to be single county offices or clusters of counties within a field office service area to efficiently serve farmers the staffing at this level varies but the nrcs work conducted in field offices includes resource inventory and assessment technical assistance conservation planning bmp implementation and program administration 3 2 acpf the innovation and its current status of use the acpf is an innovative dst that uses watershed planning concepts to identify opportunities for bmp placement within field at the field edge and in riparian areas to reduce nutrient and sediment loss in agricultural landscapes tomer et al 2013 porter et al 2018 the acpf operationalizes watershed planning concepts using publicly available geospatial datasets and an arcgis toolbox to facilitate field scale bmp placement and watershed planning at the huc 12 watershed scale typically 15 000 40 000 acres or 6070 16 187 ha tomer et al 2015a ranjan et al 2019 using high resolution lidar based elevation data national agricultural statistics service cropland data layer nass cdl land use data usda nass 2019 nrcs soil survey soils database field boundary data and watershed boundary data the acpf enables 1 hydro conditioning terrain processing and hydro enforcement of elevation data to mimic expected flow of water over the actual terrain 2 delineation of the perennial stream network and catchments in a watershed 3 identification of fields in a watershed that may be most likely to contribute nutrients and sediment to surface water and 4 sites where within field edge of field and riparian bmps could be implemented porter et al 2018 presently the acpf identifies locations for the following bmps by evaluating site specific criteria and suitability drainage water management grassed waterways contour buffer strips bioreactors nutrient removal wetlands water and sediment control basins wascobs riparian buffers and saturated riparian buffers porter et al 2018 results from the acpf provide landowners land managers and conservation planners with suites of conservation planning options and opportunities ranjan et al 2019 zimmerman et al 2019 the acpf distills complex geospatial data processing and analyses into outputs for use in conservation planning outputs from acpf include attribute tables and maps that identify and visualize relatively high risk areas of the watershed and potential bmp locations see fig 1 the acpf does not provide site level engineering design information for specific bmp s however the analytical capacity of acpf is continually expanding for example recent add on acpf toolboxes are available to estimate nutrient reduction outcomes as a percent nitrate n reduction at basin scales or per unit load basis and financial costs associated with conservation scenarios bravard et al 2020 the acpf was initially developed in 2015 by a team of practitioners and researchers with applications in watersheds located in iowa and illinois tomer et al 2015a b since its initial development the acpf has been used to inform conservation planning in selected watersheds across the us midwest church et al 2019a rundhaug et al 2018 srinivas et al 2020 however the acpf is still in the nascent stages of being considered for widespread use across the nrcs in state and field level offices both within and outside the us midwest as such the overall awareness and usage of the acpf among conservation professionals including agency staff is low ranjan et al 2020a and the agency wide use of acpf has not been formalized in any state 4 methods the data for this study come from semi structured in depth interviews with nrcs staff holding leadership positions in the state or area offices of the nrcs specific states were selected under the purview of and with guidance from a bigger team that the authors of this study were part of under the larger team efforts to study nrcs readiness to adopt the acpf states participating in the study were classified as either current or novel state current states include those that are located in the upper midwest where individual agency staff have used the acpf as part of selected watershed projects and are therefore somewhat more familiar with how the acpf can be used to address state specific resource concerns novel states include those that are located outside the upper midwest and are characterized by either limited use by individual agency staff or familiarity with how the acpf can be used to address state specific resource concerns however as we mentioned earlier see section 3 2 agency wide use of acpf has not been formalized in any state within each state our criteria for selecting interviewees were their awareness of the acpf and their ability to provide technical social and or organizational insight about nrcs readiness to adopt the acpf initial interviewees were recruited in consultation with the larger team snowball sampling was used with the initial interviewees to identify additional interviewees patton 1990 interviews were conducted until no additional interviewees were identified twenty three semi structured interviews were conducted which involved a total of 27 individuals see tables 1 and 2 interviews were conducted in person and over the phone between december 2019 and april 2020 interviews ranged from 30 min to 90 min using a series of 26 questions that explored benefits and challenges associated with agency wide use of acpf among others questions explored topics around acpf s role in and contribution to conservation planning acpf adoption throughout the agency compatibility with other dsts and planning processes and education and training needs associated with the acpf all interviews were recorded and transcribed data analysis occurred in four stages 1 initial coding 2 intercoder reliability tests 3 final coding and 4 synthesis following church et al 2019b coding and intercoder reliability tests were conducted using nvivo 12 qsr international pty ltd doncaster australia one of the co authors reviewed interview transcripts and developed an initial codebook based on the interview guide three of the study authors read two transcripts and independently assigned interview content to relevant codes codes were added iteratively through the initial coding process resulting in codebook refinement after each transcript was coded an intercoder reliability test was conducted to assess initial levels of coding agreement the three study authors discussed coding disagreements until they agreed upon shared meanings of code definition once the final coding framework was established and agreed upon an intercoder reliability test was conducted on a subset of four interviews resulting in a cohen s kappa of 0 76 indicating adequate consistency between the three authors viera and garrett 2005 the remaining interviews were coded independently by two of the study authors finally four of the study authors including the three who participated in the intercoder reliability process synthesized coded interviews the synthesized data was interpreted in the context of doi and use of science theories and was structured around looking for instances when key concepts from the two theories were mentioned by the interviewees throughout the results we include representative quotations for each theme reported along with whether the interviewee worked in a current or novel state 5 results and discussion in this section we present organizational and individual level drivers of nrcs readiness to adopt the acpf the first half of the results section presents evidence in support of organizational capacity hierarchy and structure as it relates to nrcs readiness to adopt the acpf see table 3 the second half of the results section presents evidence in support of agency staff s knowledge and perceived characteristics of the acpf before we present the drivers of nrcs readiness we want to acknowledge that even among the states where acpf use has been relatively more frequent classified in our study as current states we found limited acpf awareness including its applications to conservation planning for example an interviewee from a current state mentioned even though acpf has been out for a number of years i think we need to do a better job of sort of teaching the nrcs leadership what this thing really is we just have to do a really good job of explaining the acpf so that they can get behind it and make it a priority for our field staff to be using the acpf we re not at that point yet here in our state 5 1 organizational level drivers of acpf 5 1 1 agency capacity interviewees from both current and novel states expressed several themes that were indicative of nrcs capacity or lack thereof to adopt the acpf nrcs s capacity to facilitate acpf adoption was expressed with respect to needs pertaining to research and technical infrastructure and personnel needs pertaining to agency research and technical infrastructure were expressed in terms of coding skills and infrastructure and the ability of the nrcs to ensure that states have access to lidar data which is required to run the acpf and generate results needs pertaining to research and technical infrastructure were expressed by several interviewees and are illustrated by the following quotes we don t have the skill in the agency we don t have the coding skills we don t have the coding infrastructure we don t have the computing power i don t see nrcs developing that kind of skill any time soon current state acpf has to be tuned to each watershed acpf tuning to the watershed and achieving coverage of lidar data i think those are big challenges and we re just not going to get full coverage anytime soon i think that s one of the challenges with it right now current state are we going to get lidar flown every year doubtful especially in these delta regions where you ve got the heaviest amount of farming going on how often are you going to get that lidar data novel state whereas the preceding quotes highlight agency level research and technical infrastructure needs pertaining to acpf adoption an interviewee acknowledged that housing the acpf within the nrcs will be key to acpf adoption illustrating this point an interviewee from a novel state mentioned if you get outside of the box with nrcs the possibility of a tool being integrated into the agency would be dramatically reduced i think it the acpf would have a higher chance of adoption within the nrcs if it were housed in nrcs and we had partners feeding into it needs pertaining to personnel that included hiring and training new staff and funding also emerged in our study interviewees frequently mentioned needs pertaining to personnel to facilitate acpf adoption for example highlighting the need for nrcs to hire staff who can deal with information technology it issues an interviewee from a current state mentioned i think where nrcs struggles a little is the funding aspect of staffing when it comes to it related technical issues it just seems like it s a very uphill battle with resources and resource allotment in that regard many interviewees from both current and novel states indicated that agency restructuring and staff retirement combined with administrative and technical changes further created a need for not only hiring staff but also bridging the knowledge and skill gaps among new staff the quotes below are illustrative of this theme a few years ago they nrcs consolidated to try to make things administrative functions consistent across the country but until that structure was in place they didn t hire people and then when the new administration came over they decided to do this across us nrcs and our sister agencies so now there is a fpac farm production and conservation business center which is a separate agency outside of nrcs that is to handle all of our hiring fpac is not directly in our chain of command so we can make upper leadership aware of our staffing issues but there s nothing really within our control to have that happen quicker novel state we re actually moving away from arcgis as our planning platform software and so one of my concerns is our arcgis skillset is going to diminish among our employees as we move to cd conservation desktop which is a web application current state knowledge deficits among newly hired staff combined with a lack of adequate training and a scenario where acpf specific training needs to be delivered across different organizational levels of nrcs were frequently discussed as barriers to its adoption the quotes below are illustrative of this theme just giving people a tool such as the acpf without actually walking them through how to use it that happens a lot where this thing comes down from the nrcs leadership we don t have adequate training but we re supposed to use it some people who are really motivated and interested use it but for everybody else it s one more thing on their plate and it doesn t get adopted novel state i would just say the way the organizational structure is if a lot of training is having to be delivered down between different levels like down from national and then to the state and then from the state down that would be a hindrance for acpf adoption novel state overall interviewees from both current and novel states suggest that nrcs capacity to adopt the acpf was affected by several factors that manifested as needs pertaining to research and technical infrastructure and personnel agency staff who are trained to run the acpf and have the time to do so combined with the agency providing funding support were additional factors related to nrcs readiness to adopt the acpf for example an interviewee from a current state mentioned the amount of time from data analysis all the way down to data delivery is a hurdle we need to figure out how to get around i think as an agency the interviewee further added that this will continue to be a hurdle unless we add some person with at least a quarter of their time is directly in their pd position description that says you re really doing acpf for the next five years or whatever the need for financial support was identified by multiple interviewees as a driver for acpf adoption and is illustrated by the following quote a lot of good science does not get implemented or applied because it doesn t have the financial resources to support it so we can run apcf but once it s done now we re talking about actually applying it and using it long term we need to build financial capacity to be able to maintain it novel state 5 1 2 agency hierarchy and structure rogers 1995 411 identifies several variables that are positively and negatively related to organizational innovativeness as described below we found several of these variables pertaining to nrcs hierarchy and structure which enabled and hindered nrcs readiness to adopt the acpf a champions across organizational levels rogers doi theory establishes the role of change agents and champions in positively influencing adoption of innovations in our study individuals holding specific designations within the nrcs emerged as those who could play the role of champions expressing this theme an interviewee mentioned key nrcs positions that could help facilitate acpf adoption are conservation planners our soil conservationists and our resource conservationists at the field level if you had their buy in across the state there would be nothing stopping the tool from being adopted current state in addition to emphasizing the role of champions in promoting the acpf the aforementioned quote highlights the importance of field level staff endorsing the acpf a reference to field level staff by the interviewee also highlights the fact that nrcs is a multi level organization and how these levels can be leveraged to promote the acpf in similar vein endorsement of the acpf from nrcs national leadership was identified as a point of leverage to promote the acpf by a majority of interviewees from both current and novel states the following quotes are illustrative of this theme i think if the agency at the national level is supportive of the use of a tool like the acpf that certainly helps facilitate the adoption and use within the states current state if you find the right person at nrcs headquarters who can promote acpf and be the leader or champion they sell the program to the state conservationists who sell it to us line of staff people and then we sell it to the field so if we wanted to really be successful that s the route you d have to take current state local offices could implement something but ultimately if the acpf is going to tie together with any of our other programs and our other tools it ll have to be at a higher leadership level to be able to make it work together novel state taken together our findings suggest that acpf endorsement and promotion needs to occur from both top down and bottom up directions across the nrcs and that individuals holding specific designations across different levels of the agency can play an important role in promoting the use of acpf by acting as champions of the innovation b agency openness partners as enablers of nrcs readiness to adopt the acpf rogers 1995 408 defines system openness as the degree to which the members of a system are linked to other individuals who are external to the system this doi construct is positively related to organizational innovativeness in our study interviewees frequently identified partners and organizations external to the nrcs as key enablers of nrcs readiness to adopt the acpf from a theoretical perspective this is indicative of nrcs openness to working with external entities to facilitate acpf adoption interviewees frequently acknowledged the role partners can play in enabling nrcs to overcome their staffing and outreach capacities and therefore overcome barriers to acpf adoption the following quotes are illustrative of this theme the two acpf projects that we have going on right now are partner initiated local swcd and a nonprofit organization so partners i think are critical especially given all of the challenges that we have as an agency critical for actually doing the number crunching and for working with the local groups to promote the output current state we ve trained our employees and our partners where we re attempting to expand efforts pertaining to the acpf with our partners because again it s more than just what nrcs can do current state while novel states have not yet established partnerships to promote the acpf most novel state interviewees echoed current state s emphasis on the importance of partnerships to enable acpf adoption the following quote illustrates this theme for us our state s water quality partnership they re going to be a key stakeholder partner in terms of adoption non adoption would be our state s water quality partnership not supporting the tool novel state a few interviewees also felt that partners should be included in agency driven conversations around the acpf which in turn can enable nrcs readiness to adopt the acpf for example an interviewee from a current state mentioned the epas united states environmental protection agency of the world and the state environmental agencies also need to see these acpf generated products and then be part of this conversation as well on how do we get more of this acpf across the nation c agency centralization rogers 1995 412 defines centralization as the degree to which power and control in a system are concentrated in the hands of a relatively few individuals this doi construct is negatively related to organizational innovativeness in our study narratives around agency control and power emerged in the context of nrcs being a top down agency and bureaucratic challenges imposed by other organizations and offices within the usda e g fpac it etc as a result of these factors multiple interviewees in our study felt that their decision making abilities are constrained the following quotes are illustrative of this theme we seem to have this thing where we get something and we have no idea what it is or we re told something s coming top down from nrcs leadership and it s delivered and then all of a sudden it s like oh this is what this is and this is how you use it and getting the cart before the horse on that kind of stuff current state fpac business center handles all the administrative stuff they handle all the dollars they handle all the personnel they handle hiring it is its own branch it controls a lot of the tech a lot of the computer equipment a lot of the software a lot of the security things a lot of the network and those things are all significant we are constantly trying to work around constraints that they put on us in the name of security but sometimes it s a little too much current state given that power and control rested with the national leadership current state interviewees felt that agency staff holding leadership positions should overcome inertia and a tendency to maintain the status quo which in turn can then facilitate acpf adoption challenges related to status quo bias were not discussed by novel state interviewees as these states are in the early stages of exploring how the acpf can be used in their state the following quotes are illustrative of this theme discussed by several current state interviewees i can tell you what s hindered acpf adoption in the past and that s just that decision makers are so unbelievably busy it s just hard for them to see it just with everything else they the national leadership team have going on it was just too much too many things happening and i think that s kind of a barrier current state there s just so much inertia at the national level towards getting the acpf speared i like acpf i think it s really powerful but there s so much inertia at the higher levels current state d agency formalization rogers 1995 412 defines formalization as the degree to which an organization emphasizes its members follow rules and procedures this doi construct is negatively related to organizational innovativeness in our study the agency s emphasis on following rules and procedures emerged in the context of how acpf might interface with nrcs programmatic constraints and requirements however these constraints and requirements were not only driven by the nrcs but also other organizations and offices within the usda and the overall bureaucratic and political context this theme was expressed by a few interviewees and is illustrated by the following quotes this is not a technical issue it s a programmatic issue but one way to promote acpf is if we had the ability to say you re only eligible for the program if you have a conservation plan that s been prior prepared but congress won t let us do that the program rules the farm bill rules the political pressures the agency infrastructure prevent us from taking that hard and fast stance current state i guess i don t know how acpf would work on a field by field basis especially when our field definitions change based on fsa farm service agency and a lot of that plays into the subsidies the fsa does and field boundaries change based on that kind of stuff and i just i don t know how that acpf would work when that stuff changes regularly current state agency emphasis on following rules and procedures also emerged in the context of conservation planning being limited to the list of bmps that are approved by the nrcs for example an interviewee from a current state mentioned a bureaucratic limitation is that conservation planning is limited to our practice list that s just how nrcs thinks of things because those are essentially the bullets we have to address these things resource concerns an emphasis on following rules and procedures resulted in agency staff having limited time to deliver programs and practices to farmers for example an interviewee from a current state mentioned this year is a great example in that we haven t even really announced any of our programs yet because we re waiting on final rules from the farm bill to be posted and interpretation of rules as a result of which we have a short time frame to get programs delivered in a normal year 5 2 individual level drivers of acpf rogers 1995 170 model of five stages of the innovation decision process provided a useful theoretical grounding for the themes expressed by interviewees in our study the first two stages in the innovation decision process are the knowledge stage and the persuasion stage as per rogers 1995 171 the knowledge stage commences when an individual is exposed to an innovation s existence and gains an understanding of how it functions at the persuasion stage an individual forms a favorable or unfavorable attitude towards the innovation rogers 1995 174 interviewees in our study expressed several themes that fit within the knowledge and persuasion stages of the innovation decision process as described below in detail these themes provide a nuanced understanding of factors that can facilitate or hinder nrcs readiness to adopt the acpf from the perspective of an individual 5 2 1 the knowledge stage rogers 1995 173 identifies three types of knowledge about an innovation awareness knowledge how to knowledge and principles knowledge awareness knowledge primarily focuses on an individual s awareness that an innovation exists how to knowledge primarily consists of the information an individual needs to use an innovation properly principles knowledge primarily consists of information that helps an individual understand the functioning principles underlying how an innovation works a awareness knowledge interviewees in our study expressed that the overall awareness of the acpf was low and that there was a need to impart awareness knowledge by including acpf modules in agency delivered planning courses and trainings and by developing a narrative promoting the acpf low awareness knowledge was expressed by several interviewees and is evident in the following quote from a current state interviewee other than a few people in this office there s very little awareness of what acpf is so they field office staff and nrcs partners would recognize the usefulness of the tools if they were provided with some explanation this interviewee and many others felt that a useful medium for increasing acpf awareness was to include acpf modules in area wide planning courses they mentioned a year ago i had area wide planning course a great course but it did not include acpf in it when i talked to the instructors about it they were aware of the acpf but it wasn t on their radar to include it that would be a key thing if they start teaching it low levels of acpf awareness and the need to develop a narrative to promote it is evident in the following quotes from both current and novel state interviewees just making people aware of what it acpf actually is it s not writing the conservation plan for anybody but it s a support piece making sure they field office staff and nrcs partners understand that so if we can get that sales piece telling them what it s all about that s probably the biggest hurdle we have right now current state as long as we can show how it s going to help better get conservation on the ground target conservation and maybe help our people be more efficient and streamlined i think everybody will buy into it novel state b how to and principles knowledge it is logical that low acpf awareness knowledge would translate into low how to and principles knowledge among agency staff indeed interviewees felt that there was a need to train agency staff in both basic and advanced functionalities of the acpf however the need for imparting these two knowledge dimensions among agency staff was nuanced many interviewees recognized that staff who work at the field level should be knowledgeable about the basic functionalities of the acpf the following quotes are illustrative of this theme as long as our new staff understand what those tools are doing and what the outputs of those tools mean i think there would be a very significant asset to our planning efforts current state the other need is to train the field office in what the acpf generated output maps mean and how to access them and how to print them out and how to fill them that s not a high level training you need current state whereas these quotes reflect the need for field level staff to have the basic how to knowledge pertaining to the acpf several interviewees felt that they did not need training in advanced acpf functionalities i e understanding the functioning principles underlying how the acpf works the following quotes are illustrative of this theme we want to go to the field staff and say hey here s how to effectively use this tool rather than hey help us figure out how to effectively use this tool they don t have time to go through that learning process they have to learn something and use it rather than what i call the discovery phase if you will of a new technology current state field staff will also need acpf training it probably wouldn t be the inner workings of the tool i think what they would need to know is okay this is what s been done in the background of running this report here s the information presented how do i use it what is it useful for novel state our results highlight underlying nuances in promoting adoption of an innovation when the decision making unit is an organization as mentioned earlier see section 2 intended users of an innovation within and organization are not homogeneous therefore their knowledge needs for effectively using an innovation are different as our findings indicate for effective use of the acpf field staff should have awareness and how to knowledge about the acpf in contrast agency staff such as gis specialists who use the acpf for example to generate datasets might need to be knowledgeable about the functioning principles of how the acpf works and therefore also have principles knowledge 5 2 2 the persuasion stage the main outcome of the persuasion stage in the innovation decision process is an individual forming a positive or a negative attitude towards the innovation rogers 1995 at this stage the five perceived attributes of the innovation relative advantage compatibility complexity trialability and observability are especially important in an individual developing a favorable or unfavorable attitude towards the innovation perceived scientific credibility of the acpf is another factor that could potentially affect agency staff s attitudes which in turn can then influence their decision to use or not to use the acpf a relative advantage rogers 1995 229 defined relative advantage as the degree to which an innovation is perceived as being better than the idea it supersedes a few interviewees in our study recognized the relative advantages of the acpf while reflecting upon their experiences of using existing models within the nrcs the quotes below are illustrative of this theme acpf would give us something that we don t have right now the model i used last year i could calculate overall tons in a watershed of sediment loss and nutrients loss but then i didn t have anything to show like critical zones or anything like that novel state i think acpf is actually a more useful tool for planning than what we re getting with cart conservation assessment ranking tool which is not looking at specific locations for conservation practices it s more looking at whether or not that practice is planned on that field novel state relative advantage of an innovation indicates the benefits associated with its adoption the anticipated benefits associated with using the acpf was expressed along several dimensions by multiple interviewees in our study one such dimension was acpf s role in watershed assessment and planning specifically with respect to making the process efficient and enabling effective generation of solutions the quotes below are illustrative of this theme the value of acpf is it is one of the first tools that does allow us to get a good picture of a watershed or a landscape and actually see it in a very efficient way and quickly and on that large of a scale current state in the past we would generate all this map output and we have all these really great pieces of information but they didn t really talk to each other never really we could bring everything together to come up with better answers and that s where i think acpf would fit current state other dimensions of anticipated benefits frequently highlighted by interviewees pertained to the acpf acting as a means to help new agency staff gain an understanding of the watershed context and resulting in social outcomes such as improving the stakeholder engagement process specifically benefits pertaining to stakeholder engagement were expressed in light of informing agency s education and outreach efforts and subsequently channelizing resources specifically towards farmers and farms where they could be most effective the following quotes are illustrative of the aforementioned themes acpf would allow us to say this part of the county is where all of our drainage water management bmps would apply let s hold the training there let s target our efforts on these farmers where our outreach effort is going to apply best and be the most effective current state i think acpf has the ability to give a newly hired planner sit down and use it before they ve actually met with the producer on their farm i think that may accelerate the learning curve and give them a lot of confidence when they re talking to the producer current state as far as engaging the farmers i think it the acpf gives us an opportunity to provide them information describe what we think is going on as far as why is the water quality declining or how can we solve this problem and then giving them the method and the financial assistance to do that novel state overall our findings indicate that acpf has high relative advantage which stem from acpf bringing in improved functionalities to the watershed assessment and planning process and by providing multi dimensional benefits agency staff perceiving that the acpf has high relative advantage could encourage them to use it b compatibility rogers 1995 240 defined compatibility as the degree to which an innovation is perceived as consistent with the existing values past experiences and needs of potential adopters similarly mcnie 2007 p 19 and cash et al 2003 identify the salience of a scientific product to a potential user who sees it is compatible with their information needs as important from the perspective of an organization compatibility is especially important in relation to the degree to which an innovation is perceived to be compatible with the policies programs and processes that are in place within an organization broadly compatibility was discussed with respect to how the acpf could fit within nrcs current approach to conservation planning and program delivery specifically compatibility was discussed in the context of acpf supporting current landscape scale nrcs initiatives such as the mississippi river basin initiative mrbi national water quality initiative nwqi and regional conservation partnership program rcpp the acpf was also perceived by several interviewees to be compatible with nrcs programmatic goals and objectives for example by assisting in accomplishing policy directives around prioritizing funding at the regional state and local level the quotes listed below are illustrative of the aforementioned themes i would say just the structure right now under programs such as nwqi and mrbi where we have to develop a watershed assessment and then use that to request funding i think that structure leads us to need programs like the acpf novel state well the specific programs like our eqip well actually every program csp conservation stewardship program our crp conservation reserve program our wetland reserve easements those conservation opportunities through acpf could help identify and prioritize and target opportunities for all our programs current state acpf was also perceived to be compatible with nrcs nine step conservation planning process a key agency approach to conservation planning and program delivery under this process the agency helps farmers develop a conservation plan which is a schedule of implementation and supporting information maps designs fact sheets etc for bmps needed to treat one or more identified natural resource concerns on a unit of land see appendix 2 many interviewees frequently identified specific steps of the conservation planning process where acpf could be useful for example an interviewee from a novel state mentioned i think the acpf is going to assist us step one identify problems and opportunities and step four which is analyze resource data step seven make decisions and then also step eight is implement the plan step nine is evaluate the plan i think that s where acpf is going to really work whereas the acpf was perceived to be compatible with the nine step conservation planning process several interviewees also discussed the need for acpf to be compatible with existing dsts platforms and processes the following quotes are illustrative of this theme what i don t understand is how acpf is going to interface with what we re doing with cd and cart and some new tools that our agency s coming out with current state if acpf is determined to be valuable to the agency as a whole having it built into conservation desktop or cart as an option to run the acpf within our normal planning and assessment and ranking process i think would be very valuable current state whereas several themes emerged around how and why the acpf was perceived to be compatible several interviewees also discussed why acpf might not be compatible within certain geographic contexts in this light perceived in compatibility was discussed with respect to the need to account for diversity in geographic contexts and their unique needs as well as the type of bmps that might be applicable in a given context while both current and novel state interviewees mentioned this potential challenge this theme was more prevalent in novel states as these states are outside the original geographic scope the upper midwest of the acpf the following quotes are illustrative of this theme acpf is really geared toward cropland we re a state that s two thirds grassland and forest the long term goal would be try to develop acpf to where it better fits our state than just the midwest novel state one of the obstacles that comes with the acpf is if there are things specific to our state s landscape that the model doesn t take into account that may place practices and locations that just aren t suitable that could be a detriment if it happened novel state within our state there wasn t a vast number of practices generated by the acpf that i recall that really were applicable here obviously filter strips field borders those types of things would be relevant to our state however some of the other practices like bio reactors are not current state overall our findings indicate that acpf was perceived to be compatible with the organizational context of the nrcs especially in relation with their policies programs and processes however there was also a need for the acpf to account for different geographies and their unique needs in order it to be applicable more widely c complexity rogers 1995 257 defined complexity as the degree to which an innovation is perceived as relatively difficult to understand and use complexity emerged as a cross cutting theme i e discussions around the complex nature of the acpf emerged in the context of several of the aforementioned themes for example indicating how personnel needs and capacity might intersect with the time needed to run the acpf an interviewee from a current state mentioned acpf is complicated enough that i don t know that having someone in every office being able to use it is a realistic thing complexities pertaining to using the acpf often emerged at the intersection of the staffing capacity needed to run the toolbox and the need to make acpf input and output data applicable to the local context the following quotes are illustrative of this theme mentioned by a majority of interviewees you ve got to do some conditioning of that dem digital elevation model and digitizing the culverts to get the water running right because acpf is really that stream network so getting that hydro conditioned dem correct is pretty critical so obviously that s a huge obstacle for anybody to turnaround the acpf current state it would be more than a full time job just to do acpf and just to keep running it and make watersheds and it s not just a matter of automating a process and spitting out the answers for the whole state i mean we could do that but we re not really capturing the identity of each watershed when we do that current state whereas the aforementioned quotes highlight the complexities pertaining to using the acpf the need to deliver training across different organizational levels of nrcs see section 5 1 1 was indicative of the complexities pertaining to understanding the acpf taken together complexities around understanding and using the acpf could deter agency staff from adopting it d trialability and observability rogers 1995 258 defined trialability as the degree to which an innovation may be experimented with on a limited basis and observability as the degree to which the results of an innovation are visible to others as such quotes illustrating trialability and observability only emerged in two current states and were therefore not considered to be recurring themes in our study nevertheless our initial findings suggest the need for nrcs field offices to pilot the acpf assess whether or not the tool provides its intended benefits and have an opportunity to provide feedback regarding potential improvements highlighting these points one interviewee from a current state mentioned if we can t pilot the acpf and our people in the field office can t give feedback on it it won t be successful adding further nuances to their response the interview mentioned we ve got to put some of our better field offices and see if it s a tool that really adds value and then listen to those folks very very closely as to what value it adds and what it doesn t that s the thing that i think leadership has to guard against is that they new tools actually add value at the field level more than anything else current state in addition to highlighting the importance of trialing the acpf at the field office level the aforementioned quote highlights the need for the acpf to add value i e have tangible benefits tangibility of results and that results are observable by others are important components of the doi construct of observability the quotes below are illustrative of this acpf responds to demand from partners that are wanting to do watershed planning but need the technical support so if there s success or success stories out there of how acpf has helped them in practice and others see that and say we want this in our watershed or our county so we can use your dollars effectively that could motivate a state conservationist through a state technical committee to adopt the acpf current state if we have people at that field level that are showing how they used it to actually put conservation on the ground that s where you need to be to promote the acpf you need to be able to show we did a cost share with this farmer and it was partly because of the fact that we are using these new tools to help with showing a farmer his property on a map current state e perceived scientific credibility mcnie 2007 and cash et al 2003 point out the impact of the perceived validity and credibility of a scientific product on its use for example if an innovation is perceived to be science based and therefore valid and credible agency staff are likely to develop a favorable attitude towards it a key outcome of the persuasion stage in doi theory a positive attitude can then foster use of acpf by agency staff most interviewees in our study felt that acpf was grounded in science and that using a scientific tool further added credibility to agency staff when working with farmers the following quotes are illustrative of this theme acpf is science based one of the most important things that goes into acpf is that it s got excellent science behind it that i think is one of the most important parts of it current state the relationship the farmer has with the conservation planner and their credibility is critical when you re going out to the farm and you say i think this particular area s a critical point for you to address in addition to my findings if i had a map that was done by a scientific tool such as the acpf that came up with the same conclusion that gives me that much more credibility novel state other interviewees reiterated the importance of ensuring that the results generated by the acpf were validated in order to enhance its trustworthiness applicability and usefulness for example an interviewee from a current state mentioned validating the data making sure it s applicable it s efficient it s easy to use i think all those things culminate in the adoption of acpf using a cautionary tone the interviewee further added my overarching pause is making certain that tools like the acpf and other models are calibrated and validated so that at the end of the day we have a resource that we can trust and that the research community can say yes this tool is as accurate as we can make it with the resources that we have today expressing the importance of validating acpf data an interviewee from a current state mentioned if you run acpf for every watershed what is your plan for verifying those results without that it s not going to be very useful to sum up our theoretically grounded enquiry confirmed many elements of doi and use of science theories and in doing so helped answer the following question of practical importance how ready is the nrcs to adopt the acpf we found that several organizational and individual level factors influenced nrcs readiness to adopt the acpf see table 3 the following organizational and individual level factors were predominantly positive indicators of nrcs readiness to adopt the acpf champions across organizational levels agency openness relative advantage and perceived scientific credibility the following organizational and individual level factors were predominantly negative indicators of nrcs readiness to adopt the acpf agency capacity agency centralization agency formalization level of acpf knowledge and complexity compatibility emerged as a factor that affected acpf adoption both positively and negatively 6 conclusions agricultural dsts are a type of innovation that is increasingly becoming the norm in conservation planning however owing to the complex nature of the innovation decision process in an organization limited scholarly attention has been paid to assessing organizational readiness for innovation in order to fulfill this knowledge gap we drew upon theories of doi and the use of science to examine organizational and individual level factors that could enable or deter the nrcs to adopt the acpf semi structured interviews conducted with nrcs staff holding leadership positions resulted in an in depth descriptive illustration of the agency s readiness to adopt the acpf as well as several theoretical and practical insights our finding that nrcs readiness to adopt the acpf was an outcome of both organizational and individual level factors finds support in scholarship around the theory of organizational readiness for change orc gustafson et al 2003 weiner 2009 lokuge et al 2019 the consolidated framework for implementation research keith et al 2017 miake lye et al 2020 and findings from doi and use of science theories rogers 1995 ouimet at al 2009 for example as per orc organizational readiness is an outcome of an organization s commitment to change referred as change valance adequacy of resources necessary to implement the change referred as change efficacy and contextual factors such as having flexible organizational strategies and partnerships lokuge et al 2019 the orc also highlights the importance of assessing staff s perceptions of an organization s push for change kelly et al 2017 confirming the aforementioned theories and frameworks we also found that nrcs readiness to change and use the acpf was a function of agency staff s perceptions of the organization and the innovation and the broader organizational context a novel theoretical contribution of this study is the demonstration of synergies between doi and use of science theories when organizations prepare to adopt an innovation that is a scientific product a host of factors come into play while use of science theory does recognize agency personnel as working within agencies doi theory brings a more nuanced treatment of agency characteristics such as champions external partnerships centralization and formality doi theory also highlights specific elements of the innovation itself not included in use of science theory such as relative advantage complexity trialability and observability on the other hand use of science theory calls attention to the credibility of the scientific product as a critical factor which is a key focus of the scientific method and a theme that emerged from our data an important overlap between the two theories is the doi factor compatibility which is essentially the same concept as salience in the use of science literature finally studies grounded in the use of science theory highlight an important factor not highlighted by doi research legitimacy of the process of creating the scientific product legitimacy did not emerge as a key factor in the adoption of the acpf which is an unexpected result and worth further inquiry several of our findings are supported by the current literature for example acpf s relative advantages of improving stakeholder engagement and acting as a medium for agency staff to gain an understanding of their watershed have been documented in the current literature ranjan et al 2019 zimmerman et al 2019 perceived scientific credibility and compatibility of an innovation are other themes from our study that are supported by the current literature as documented in the literature around use of science in order to foster uptake of science by civil servants the scientific information should not only be perceived as credible but it should also be applicable to the local context koontz 2019 we found that the acpf was perceived as credible by agency staff however they also felt that the acpf should account for different geographies and their unique needs to make the findings from the acpf locally applicable whereas a strong theoretical foundation allows us to test doi and use of science theories by applying it in the novel context of nrcs a key question remains what do our findings mean for the nrcs several of the individual level themes in our study fall under the knowledge and persuasion stages of rogers innovation decision process rogers 1995 170 conceptualizing nrcs as the decision making unit this is indicative of the agency being in the initial stages of getting ready to adopt the acpf i e gaining knowledge which then translates into forming an attitude towards the innovation moreover the fact that trialability and observability did not emerge as recurring themes in our study indicates that agency staff are still forming an attitude towards the acpf from a practical standpoint this highlights the need for nrcs to continue to invest resources towards piloting the acpf in different watersheds and measuring both social and bio physical outcomes to aid observability doing so could help the agency move further along rogers next three stages of the innovation decision process decision implementation and confirmation rogers 1995 170 several of the organizational level themes we found constitute internal and external characteristics of the nrcs documented by rogers 1995 411 and ouimet et al 2009 337 from the perspective of the process of adopting an innovation or incorporating science into decisions interviewees expressing several research and technical infrastructure and personnel needs see section 5 1 1 indicates that the agency is currently in the initiation phase of the innovation process rogers 1995 421 indeed the ability of the acpf to foster a small watershed approach konopacky and ristino 2017 and perhaps engender a fundamental shift in nrcs conservation planning approach fits with the following two stages within the initiation phase of the innovation process agenda setting and matching rogers 1995 421 from the perspective of orc this is also indicative of nrcs commitment to change referred as change valance lokuge et al 2019 however our finding that agency staff are still in the stage of forming an attitude towards the acpf suggests the need to prioritize efforts towards piloting the acpf and measuring social and bio physical outcomes as per rogers 1995 412 an organization emphasizing that its members follow rules and procedures formalization can inhibit the consideration of innovation by organization members but encourage the implementation of innovations we found that programmatic constraints and requirements discouraged interviewees from considering the acpf however an agency emphasizing that rules and procedures are followed can also result in a structure that encourages the adoption of innovations for example acpf s compatibility with nrcs nine step conservation planning process a rule oriented structured process that facilitates conservation planning can encourage agency staff to adopt the acpf similarly we found that the agency structure can create opportunities for acpf endorsement and promotion to occur from both top down and bottom up directions organizational structure can also enable members to gain access to each other s expertise and perhaps create an organizational milieu that helps them overcome their initial perceptions regarding the value of the innovation and therefore encourage adoption in the longer run frank et al 2004 therefore whereas rules and procedures can initially impede agency staff to consider the acpf in the longer run agency structure can also enable acpf adoption like all studies this one has limitations for example as pointed out by rogers 1995 one could question how well the perceptions of staff holding leadership positions represent those of staff at the field level while we acknowledge this limitation including interview data from field staff was beyond the objectives and scope of this study we would also like to acknowledge that selection of initial interviewees in consultation with the larger team could have resulted in selection of interviewees especially those from current states who might have had a more favorable attitude towards the acpf that said we took steps such as carefully wording interview questions and running intercoder reliability tests to negate any underlying biases another limitation of our study design is that we are unable to make any claims about the relative significance of any given driver of nrcs readiness to adopt the acpf and the generalizability of our findings beyond the nrcs that said being a multi level organization a type of organizational structure common to many government agencies ngos and non profits the nrcs provided us with a fitting platform to test theories around organizational readiness for innovation by doing so our hope is that we are able to inform agency level discussions around adoption of dsts lastly we would like to acknowledge that due to the limitations of our research design we are not able to compare and contrast findings across different state i e novel versus current and interviewee types e g leadership versus field staff indeed no systematic differences across state and interviewee types emerged in our study future research could use quantitative approaches to identify drivers of organizational readiness their relative importance and any variations across geography and respondent designations and roles by employing an exploratory approach we were able to identify and describe organizational and individual level factors that could both enable or deter the nrcs from adopting the acpf in doing so we confirmed what we had initially postulated i e agency staffs perceptions of the organization and the scientific innovation will collectively influence their decision to adopt or reject the acpf overall our findings suggest that nrcs is currently in the initiation phase of the innovation process with agency staff still forming an attitude towards the acpf both these factors indicate that the agency is getting ready for change but there is a need to invest resources towards piloting the acpf and measuring outcomes and helping agency staff overcome both real and perceived barriers to adopting the acpf credit authorship contribution statement pranay ranjan conceptualization methodology validation writing original draft writing review editing funding acquisition emily m usher

3617,identification of long term water quality trends in response to watershed anthropogenic interventions is crucial for developing and adapting water pollution control strategies this study represents the first use of the weighted regressions on time discharge and season wrtds model to evaluate trends and sources of riverine nitrogen n levels over the 1980 2019 period in the yongan river watershed of eastern china the wrtds model showed satisfactory accuracies for predicting daily riverine total n tn nh4 and no3 concentrations loads r2 0 55 n 366 modeled flow normalized riverine nh4 concentration increased by 789 from 1980 to 2009 and then decreased by 63 in 2010 2019 this changing trend for riverine nh4 concentration was mainly attributed to a 43 decrease of wastewater nh4 discharge load in 2010 2019 due to establishment of three new wwtps in urban areas and enhanced rural domestic sewage collection treatment although chemical n fertilizer use decreased by 49 and domestic animal numbers decreased by 73 in 2000 2019 flow normalized riverine tn and no3 concentrations progressively increased by 161 and 232 in 1980 2019 respectively the paradox between decreasing n inputs and increasing riverine tn no3 concentrations is attributed to inputs of legacy n from soil and groundwater this is supported by the 3 8 fold increase of riverine no3 concentration in 1980 2019 86 increase in 2000 2019 following 10 days with no precipitation representing groundwater contributions to baseflow and a 4 1 fold increase of riverine no3 concentration in 1980 2019 91 increase in 2000 2019 following the first rainstorm after 10 days of no precipitation representing soil flushing these results document that point source pollution control efforts were effective whereas benefits from nonpoint source pollution control were masked by inputs from legacy n pollution the wrtds model was demonstrated to be a useful tool for assessing long term riverine n pollution dynamics and sources thereby providing decision makers with critical information to guide watershed n pollution control strategies keywords wrtds eutrophication nonpoint source point source legacy nutrients watershed management 1 introduction excessive nitrogen n inputs originating from anthropogenic activities have caused sharp increases in n loadings to surface waters worldwide leading to degradation of aquatic ecosystem health harmful algal bloom and hypoxia anoxia galloway et al 2008 gu et al 2015 over the past several decades many regions and or countries have made tremendous efforts e g improving domestic wastewater treatment reducing fertilizer applications and recycling domestic animal wastes to mitigate aquatic n pollution bernhardt et al 2005 craig et al 2008 ma et al 2020 stets et al 2020 however it is critical to monitor the water quality changes to evaluate the effectiveness of these control actions lee et al 2016 liu et al 2017 sinha and michalak 2016 due to a lag time between implementation of watershed management measures and the river water quality response long term water quality trend analysis is required to fully explore the efficiency of relevant n pollution control efforts meals et al 2010 in general riverine n concentration or load metrics display high daily seasonal and annual variability due to the interaction of natural e g climate and hydrology and anthropogenic factors e g n input density and land use chen et al 2004 choquette et al 2019 sinha and michalak 2016 stets et al 2020 in addition riverine n monitoring data are usually discrete and or sampled with variable intervals such as monthly biweekly or weekly hirsch et al 2010 therefore appropriate statistical approaches are required to detect long term trends in riverine n levels based on discrete monitoring data and to identify the influence of anthropogenic interventions stenback et al 2011 a range of statistical approaches such as nonparametric mann kendall test kendall 1975 sen s slope sen 1968 seasonal sen s slope hirsch et al 1982 generalized additive gam model morton and henderson 2008 load estimator loadest model runkel et al 2004 and weighted regressions on time discharge and season wrtds model hirsch et al 2010 are utilized to quantify trend magnitude changes in riverine n and other water quality indexes p sediment carbon etc from a long term perspective watershed pollution sources land use types and distributions and hydrometeorological patterns are remarkably altered thereby imposing variable relationships between river water quality and hydrology over time hirsch et al 2010 among the above mentioned statistical approaches wrtds utilizes a window regression approach for each day of the estimation period which provides variable coefficients for quantifying changes in water quality trends over long term periods hirsch et al 2010 thus the wrtds model provides a flexible theoretically robust and applicable tool to quantify long term water quality trends over a broad range of conditions hirsch 2014 lee et al 2016 as a conceptually rooted weighted regression model wrtds comprehensively describes characteristics and trends of water quality signals throughout the discharge and time regimes based on discrete monitoring data as well as distinguishing anthropogenic and climate impacts with the flow normalization procedure hirsch et al 2010 hirsch and de cicco 2015 integrating historical information concerning anthropogenic activities with the wrtds can provide critical evidence for identifying the roles of different components e g point nonpoint sources of pollution surface water and groundwater regulating riverine water quality trends hirsch et al 2010 zhang et al 2021 therefore wrtds has been widely applied for assessing water quality trends and sources in the mississippi river watershed sprague et al 2011 susquehanna river basin van meter et al 2017 south fork shenandoah river zhang et al 2021 and grand river watershed van meter and basu 2017 however the wrtds model has not been evaluated to address long term riverine n level trend analyses in china a country with rapidly changing and severe riverine n pollution levels originating from multiple point and nonpoint sources rare works are available to address long term riverine n dynamics in response to multiple water pollution control measures over the past several decades many chinese rivers e g the yangzi river yellow river and pearl river have experienced significant water quality impairment associated with rapid economic development human population expansion urbanization and agricultural intensification chen et al 2004 chen et al 2019 gao et al 2016 huang et al 2021 to control water pollution the chinese government has implemented a range of national level measures zhang and wen 2008 ma et al 2020 such as regulation on the prevention and control of pollution from large scale breeding of livestock and poultry 2014 action plan for water pollution prevention and control 2015 action plan for zero growth in fertilizer use 2015 and toilet revolution plan 2015 in compliance with national policies some local governments issued and implemented more rigorous water pollution control measures for example zhejiang province carried out the 811 eight major river systems and eleven key supervised areas environmental pollution renovation activity since 2005 and the five water wastewater floodwater waterlogging water supply and water saving co treatment program since 2014 to assess the efficacy of these efforts several national or regional assessments of selected rivers and lakes have documented improvements in water quality in recent years huang et al 2021 liu et al 2017 ma et al 2020 these assessments usually addressed water quality trends based on analyses of often limited and or short term monitoring records rendering them unable to identify the efficiencies of individual water pollution control efforts e g extending and improving wwtps adopting fertilizer reduction strategy restricting livestock populations huang et al 2021 ma et al 2020 therefore it is strongly warranted to investigate long term river water quality trends to identify the efficacies of different water pollution control measures to guide future watershed management herein this study represents the first use of the wrtds model to address long term riverine n dynamics in a typical river system the yongan river in eastern china based on a 40 year record 1980 2019 of riverine n tn no3 and nh4 concentrations and river discharge the wrtds model was calibrated to address long term riverine n dynamics our specific objectives were to investigate 1 the applicability of the wrtds model 2 the trends and sources of riverine n pollution and 3 the efficacy of point and nonpoint source pollution control efforts this work assesses long term riverine n dynamics in response to multiple water pollution control measures thereby guiding the development optimization of n management strategies to effectively control excessive riverine n levels to downstream coastal waters 2 method 2 1 watershed description the yongan river watershed 120 13 46 121 0 52 e and 28 28 10 29 2 22 n elevation 15 1000 m is located in the highly developed taizhou area of zhejiang province in eastern china fig 1 it is the third largest river of zhejiang province one of eight major river systems in zhejiang province and flows into taizhou estuary and the east china sea a coastal area that commonly experiences hypoxia gao and zhang 2010 li et al 2007 the sampling location fig 1 for this study was 55 km upstream of taizhou estuary at an elevation of 15 m the river drains a total area of 2474 km2 and has an average annual water depth of 5 42 m and discharge of 72 9 m3 s 1 at the sampling location the climate is subtropical monsoon having average annual precipitation of 1400 mm and an average annual temperature of 17 4 c rainfall mainly occurs in may september with a typhoon season in july september and a dry season from october to february there are no dams or transboundary water withdrawals along the main river channel and no significant trends in annual precipitation amount or average river discharge during the study period table 1 total population within the watershed increased from 590 000 to 770 000 between 1980 and 2019 agricultural land including paddy field garden plot and dry land accounted for 11 17 of total watershed area in 1980 2019 with developed land including rural urban residential lands roads and mining industrial lands woodland and barren land contributing to 2 5 68 72 and 6 17 respectively table 1 to comply with the 811 environmental pollution renovation activity 2005 and five water co treatment program 2014 issued by zhejiang province the taizhou city government implemented a range of measures e g urban and rural infrastructure construction industrial wastewater treatment livestock and poultry breeding regulation application of formula fertilization by soil testing to mitigate water pollution wanting 2017 in the yongan river watershed three new centralized wwtps were established one in 2007 and two in 2010 to treat domestic wastewater and selected industrial wastewaters in urban areas total sewage treatment capacity in the urban area was increased to 4 8 104 ton day 1 with anaerobic anoxic oxic treatment process resulting in a reduction of the annual total nh4 load in wastewater discharge by 43 between 2010 and 2019 fig 2 beginning in 2005 industrial enterprises not connected to centralized wwtps were required to develop independent sewage treatment facilities to meet category ⅰ integrated wastewater discharge standards gb 8978 1996 in rural areas each village 500 in the watershed developed a domestic sewage centralized treatment facility with a capacity of at least 30 ton day 1 since 2000 the watershed experienced a 49 reduction in n fertilizer application and a 73 decrease in the domestic animal population on an equivalent number of pigs basis fig 2 2 2 data sources 2 2 1 water quality and hydrometeorological data river water samples were collected once every 4 8 weeks n 366 at baizhiao station watershed outlet fig 1 during the 1980 2019 study period with bimonthly sampling campaigns mainly during the 1995 1998 and 2003 2012 periods total nitrogen tn nitrate no3 and ammonia nh4 concentrations for the 1980 2012 period were provided by the taizhou city environment protection bureau and monthly data for the october 2014 september 2019 period were collected analyzed by our team a groundwater monitoring well was established 15 m depth fig 1 near baizhiao station and groundwater no3 concentrations were measured monthly for the period of 2014 2019 n 62 mixed river samples three samples across the river cross section and groundwater samples were collected between 8 00 a m and 9 00 a m on each sampling date acidified with h2so4 in the field 10 ml of concentrated h2so4 per liter and analyzed within 4 h of sampling nitrate concentration was determined by the spectrophotometric phenol disulfonic acid method limit of detection lod 0 01 mg n l 1 nh4 by the spectrophotometric salicylic acid method lod 0 02 mg n l 1 tn by persulfate digestion with uv spectrophotometric detection of no3 lod 0 04 mg n l 1 respectively state environmental protection administration of china 2002 daily river discharge and precipitation amounts at three weather monitoring stations within the watershed for the 1980 2019 period were obtained from the local hydrology bureau and weather bureau respectively 2 2 2 anthropogenic nitrogen input data annual livestock and poultry quantities fertilizer application land use types and population data for the 1980 2019 period as well as the nh4 load from municipal sewage and industrial wastewater in the 1996 2019 period fig 2 table 1 were derived from local yearbooks of xianju county and linhai city to address long term changes in livestock populations the number of each domestic animal type was converted into an equivalent number of pigs fig 2 based on their n excretion rates han et al 2014 2 3 weighted regressions on time discharge and season wrtds model calibration this study adopted the wrtds model to estimate daily riverine n concentration and loads from the discrete water quality measurements in the yongan river during 1980 2019 the basic regression equation of wrtds is expressed as hirsch et al 2010 1 ln c β 0 β 1 t β 2 ln q β 3 sin 2 π t β 4 cos 2 π t ε where ln is natural log c is riverine n concentration mg n l 1 t is the time in decimal year q is measured daily average water discharge m3 s 1 β 0 β 4 are fitted coefficients and ε is the unexplained variation the coefficients β 0 β 4 and ε are allowed to vary in a gradual manner throughout the river water discharge and time regimes the wrtds model and its analysis procedures were available as the egret package version 3 0 2 in the r computing framework which were fully described in hirsch and de cicco 2015 according to the data requirements for the wrtds model hirsch et al 2010 the long term data series 40 years from the yongan river having a large number of data points n 366 and daily river water discharge meets the necessary requirements the metrics of coefficient of determination r2 and bias hirsch 2014 hirsch and de cicco 2015 were adopted to assess the performance of the wrtds model calibration wrtds model uses a window approach to give each sampling point a corresponding weight based on the product of weighted values in the three dimensions of time season and ln q the weights were expressed as a function of the distance between the estimation point and the sample points which is measured by the window parameters windowy windows and windowq our previous modeling results for the yongan river watershed indicated that there was a 7 13 year lag time between agricultural anthropogenic n inputs and riverine n export whereas there was a negligible lag time between wastewater n discharge and riverine n export chen et al 2014 hu et al 2018 therefore the parameter windowy was set from 5 years the minimum value of windowy contained 100 observations with nonzero weights hirsch et al 2010 to 15 years to determine the optimal windowy values for simulating river tn nh4 and no3 concentrations based on the model performances r2 and bias values other parameters of the model were set at default values e g 0 5 years for windows and 2 natural log units for windowq in this study using the calibrated wrtds model we obtained comprehensive predictions for tn no3 and nh4 throughout the discharge and time regimes the flow normalized n concentrations loads were estimated as the average of the estimated concentration under the full set of discharge conditions occurring on a given calendar date thereby eliminating the influence of random temporal variability in streamflow when assessing the impacts of relevant anthropogenic interventions the uncertainty analysis was conducted with the wrtds bootstrap test wbt procedure using the egretci r package version 2 0 3 to quantify 90 confidence intervals ci and likelihoods of riverine n trends hirsch et al 2015 using the fn2q approach provided by zhang et al 2021 riverine flow normalized nh4 concentrations and loads were further decomposed into different hydrological conditions i e high and low flows regimes to address potential influencing factors on riverine nh4 dynamics high and low flows regimes represented the upper 50 and the lower 50 of the discharge records respectively to address potential contributions from groundwater and soil n pools annual average riverine no3 concentrations following conditions of 10 day of no precipitation and first rainstorm event 30 mm per 24 hr after a 10 day no precipitation period were estimated for each year by the calibrated wrtds model all correlation and regression analyses e g r2 and coefficient of variation cv were performed using functions in the r computing framework r development core team 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the wrtds model overall the model performances r2 and bias values for simulating river tn and no3 concentrations were relatively stable when windowy values varied between 5 and 15 years fig 3 model performances for nh4 were also stable when the windowy values ranged from 5 to 10 years whereas performance decreased significantly when the windowy value was 10 years these results indicated that the wrtds model performances were not sensitive to windowy values hirsch et al 2010 according to the previously identified lag times 7 13 yr between anthropogenic n inputs and riverine n exports in the yongan river watershed chen et al 2014 hu et al 2018 and the recommended model default values hirsch et al 2010 we selected 13 13 and 5 years as the windowy values for tn no3 and nh4 simulations respectively the calibrated wrtds model provided reasonable results for predicting riverine n concentrations and loads in the yongan river fig 4 the modeled riverine tn nh4 and no3 concentrations as well as loads presented good agreement with observed values r2 0 55 the r2 values between modeled and observed tn nh4 and no3 concentrations or loads fell within the range of estimated r2 values 0 05 0 85 for concentrations and 0 60 0 97 for loads in previous applications of the wrtds model oelsner et al 2017 bias values between observed and modeled tn nh4 and no3 loads were 0 013 0 048 and 0 040 respectively which fell within the acceptable bias range of 0 1 0 1 for the wrtds model hirsch 2014 hirsch and de cicco 2015 determined load bias values in this study were comparable to previous applications of the wrtds model in other river systems 0 044 0 031 for nitrate in the mississippi river sprague et al 2011 0 002 for nitrate in the raccoon river hirsch 2014 0 003 for tn nox in the chesapeake bay watershed zhang et al 2019 and 0 087 0 083 for tn nox concentrations and loads in 471 stream sites across the united states oelsner et al 2017 this pattern indicates that the estimated concentrations and loads were consistent with the observed pattern these results confirm that the calibrated wrtds model was effective for estimating daily concentrations and loads for tn nh4 and no3 in the yongan river over the 1980 2019 period the model performances for n load product of concentration and discharge simulations were better than those of n concentrations fig 4 which is attributed to the higher temporal variability in river discharge than n concentrations table 1 the temporal variability of riverine n loads was also more dependent on water discharge r2 0 50 0 86 than concentrations r2 0 001 0 03 moreover since concentrations were simulated by the wrtds model while discharges were from monitored results performances for modeled loads were generally better than those of concentrations fig 4 the residuals of model results were independent of mean n concentrations or loads with a symmetry around the zero line fig 4c f i p 0 05 and no significant differences with respect to discharge time or seasonal components fig 5 indicating robust model results higher residuals were observed in 1980 2000 which could be attributed to relative higher variability of n concentrations especially for nh4 and no3 table 1 and lower sampling frequency 6 times per year in some years therefore it is warranted to increase n monitoring frequency and or adding storm sampling to improve accuracy in future applications of the wrtds model oelsner et al 2017 3 2 long term change of riverine nh4 level in the yongan river watershed the wrtds model estimated that annual riverine flow normalized nh4 concentration increased from 0 09 90 ci 0 06 0 12 mg n l 1 in 1980 to a peak of 0 80 0 71 0 99 mg n l 1 in 2009 before progressively declining to 0 30 0 13 0 42 mg n l 1 in 2019 fig 6 in 2005 2015 annul average nh4 concentration exceeded the category iii standard for chinese surface waters 0 5 mg n l 1 gb3838 2002 correspondingly the estimated annual riverine flow normalized nh4 load rapidly increased from 2 76 105 1 58 4 04 105 kg n yr 1 in 1980 to reach a peak of 14 45 105 9 82 18 77 105 kg n yr 1 in 2008 and then decreased to 6 50 105 3 27 8 82 105 kg n yr 1 in 2019 the proportion of riverine tn comprised of nh4 increased from 10 in 1980 to 47 in 2009 before declining to 12 in 2019 fig 6 estimated likelihood values 0 99 for flow normalized nh4 concentrations loads showed highly likely increasing trends in the 1980 2009 period and highly likely decreasing trends in the 2009 2019 period fig 6 hirsch et al 2015 in general nh4 is readily adsorbed to soil and river bed substrates by cation exchange reactions craig et al 2008 and or converted to nitrate by soil in stream nitrification hu et al 2019 resulting in low nh4 concentrations in most natural waters therefore anthropogenic point source pollution i e domestic and industrial wastewater discharges is the dominant source of elevated riverine nh4 levels in most cases huang et al 2014 this inference is supported by the dilution pattern observed between riverine nh4 concentration and water discharge i e lower and higher concentrations occurred in high and low flow regimes respectively fig 7 b and fig 8 a additionally the flow normalized nh4 load during the low flow regime r2 0 62 p 0 01 was more dependent on wastewater nh4 discharge load than that during the high flow regime r2 0 46 p 0 01 therefore the mitigation of riverine nh4 pollution in the yongan river watershed was mainly ascribed to improvements in wastewater collection treatment along with some reductions in animal waste runoff owing to reductions in livestock populations the rapid increase in riverine nh4 levels during the 1980 2009 period fig 6 were attributed to increasing industrial and domestic wastewater discharged directly into the river network in the absence of wastewater treatment plants wwtps jin et al 2014 this period of time corresponds to rapid urbanization and industrial development as well as a rapidly increasing population density in the yongan river watershed table 1 consequently annual wastewater nh4 discharge increased by 233 between 1996 and 2010 fig 2 notably the riverine nh4 load increased following the establishment of the first new wwtp in 2007 we ascribe this increased nh4 load to the continuous increase of local wastewater amounts due to rapidly growing population and industries during this time period thereby limiting the observed impacts of the first new wwtp conversely the large decline in riverine nh4 levels during the 2010 2019 period were mainly associated with the 43 decrease in wastewater nh4 discharge load between 2010 and 2019 fig 2 due to construction of three new central wwtps in urban areas as well as enhanced industrial wastewater treatment and improved rural domestic sewage treatment quantitatively the decrease of urban domestic wastewater nh4 discharge corresponds to a reduction in annual average riverine nh4 concentration by 0 1 mg n l 1 20 it is difficult to estimate the contribution of enhanced rural domestic wastewater treatment and individual industrial enterprise wastewater treatment to riverine nh4 concentration however the greater decline in nh4 concentrations in autumn winter 74 than in spring summer 58 during 2010 2019 fig 7b fig 7e supports the importance of wastewater treatment since point source pollution is most strongly expressed in the dormant dry season which is also the low flow regime i e less dilution in this watershed hu et al 2018 overall these results indicate that mitigation of nh4 pollution in the yongan river was strongly improved by implementation of greater wastewater treatment capacity efficiency to reduce point source pollution 3 3 long term changes of riverine tn and no3 levels for the yongan river the wrtds model estimated that annual flow normalized tn concentration continuously increased from 0 89 90 ci 0 85 0 95 mg n l 1 in 1980 to 2 32 2 13 2 58 mg n l 1 in 2019 resulting in a 161 increase 74 increase in 2000 s the increased tn concentrations resulted in a related increase in the annual flow normalized tn load from 1 82 106 kg 1 73 1 95 106 n yr 1 to 4 54 106 3 89 5 17 106 kg n yr 1 fig 6 moreover annual flow normalized no3 concentration increased by 232 over the 40 yr study period fig 6 with a steady increased from 0 37 0 26 0 45 mg n l 1 in 1980 to 1 23 1 11 1 50 mg n l 1 in 2019 86 increase in 2000 s this resulted in a corresponding increase in the annual flow normalized no3 load from 0 90 106 0 62 1 18 106 kg n yr 1 in 1980 to 2 73 106 2 17 3 42 106 kg n yr 1 in 2019 estimated likelihood values 0 99 for flow normalized tn and no3 concentrations loads showed highly likely increasing trends during the study period fig 6 hirsch et al 2015 the ratio of riverine no3 to tn fluctuated within a narrow range of 45 to 50 with a trend for higher proportions since 2012 2019 nitrate is the predominant form of n in many agricultural watersheds because it is highly mobile and readily leached from soils craig et al 2008 resulting in high riverine no3 concentrations usually occurring in high flow regimes fig 7c due to lack of data concerning wastewater no3 and tn loads it was not possible to evaluate the impacts of wwtp facilities on riverine no3 and tn concentrations however the impacts of wwtps on no3 and tn appeared to be limited as indicated by continuous increasing trends in observed riverine no3 and tn concentrations between 2007 and 2019 previous dual stable isotope 15n no3 18o no3 analysis for the yongan river in 2014 2017 indicated that wastewater contributed to 25 15 of the riverine no3 load hu et al 2019 therefore nonpoint source pollution is inferred to be the dominant contribution of riverine no3 tn in the yongan river watershed in contrast to the increasing concentrations of riverine no3 tn annual chemical n fertilizer application decreased by 49 in 2000 2019 and domestic livestock numbers decreased by 73 since 1980 fig 2 such contrasting trends between watershed n source inputs and riverine no3 tn levels are attributed to contributions of legacy n accumulated in soils and groundwater that have a purported lag time of 7 13 years in the yongan river watershed chen et al 2014 huang et al 2014 hu et al 2018 the wrtds model estimated annual average riverine no3 concentration for the 10 day no precipitation condition increased 3 8 fold between 1980 and 2019 86 increase observed in 2000 2019 fig 9 a in the yongan river watershed this implies an increasing contribution of groundwater n to riverine n loads during stable baseflow conditions chen et al 2014 hu et al 2018 van meter et al 2016 this is supported by an increasing no3 concentration in groundwater near the outlet of the watershed during the 2014 2019 period fig 9b furthermore the annual average no3 concentration for the first rainstorm events after 10 days with no precipitation associated with soil profile flushing increased 4 1 fold in the 1980 2019 period 91 increase in 2000 2019 fig 9a the average riverine no3 concentration for the first rainstorm event after 10 day with no precipitation 0 99 mg n l 1 was 18 higher than that observed for the 10 day no precipitation condition 0 83 mg n l 1 during the past 10 years these results are attributed to an increasing n contribution from soil organic n mineralization to riverine n pollution in recent years dry antecedent conditions allow accumulation of mineral n from soil organic n mineralization that is subsequently leached from the soil profile to surface waters during rainstorm events kopáček et al 2013 xiang et al 2008 previous modeling and dual isotope 2h h2o 18o h2o studies in the yongan river watershed indicated that slow subsurface flow and groundwater contributed 75 of annual river discharge with a mean transit time of 4 5 yr and contributed 58 81 of the riverine tn load through groundwater transport hu et al 2018 hu et al 2019 hu et al 2020 our dual stable isotope 15n no3 18o no3 analysis for the yongan river from 2014 to 2017 further demonstrated that soil and groundwater sources contributed 33 8 and 43 17 of riverine no3 loads respectively hu et al 2019 a previous modeling study similarly predicted that soil organic n mineralization and release contributed 35 on average to riverine tn export load in the yongan river watershed during the 1980 2009 period chen et al 2014 increasing contributions of soil and groundwater legacy n pools to riverine no3 loads are also supported by decreasing coefficients of variance for monthly no3 concentrations in the 2000 2019 period p 0 01 additionally there was no significant seasonal variation in the rate of increase for no3 concentrations during this period fig 7f collectively these data modeling results suggest that soil and groundwater legacy n sources mask any response of riverine no3 tn concentrations to nonpoint source pollution control measures in the yongan river watershed 3 4 implications for riverine n pollution control for the yongan river watershed the wrtds model confirmed the efficacy of point source pollution control efforts as demonstrated by decreased riverine nh4 levels resulting from improvements in urban industrial and rural wastewater treatment conversely the model did not detect improvements in nonpoint source pollution control as riverine no3 and tn levels continued to increase over the study period despite the appreciable reductions in nh4 point source inputs riverine nh4 concentration was not able to meet category iii ⅴ water quality standards chinese national criteria during the low mid discharge regimes in spring when dilution capacity was low fig 7b high nh4 concentrations in surface waters pose appreciably risks to downstream aquatic ecosystems such as ammonia toxicity eutrophication and hypoxia resulting from oxygen consumption during nitrification camargo and alonso 2006 therefore wastewater collection and treatment should be further enhanced with a particular focus on rural areas where wastewater collection treatment is not fully implemented decreased recycling of human and animal excreta as an agricultural nutrient source over the past several decades gu et al 2015 and the lack of efficient sewage collection treatment in rural areas chen et al 2013 are major causes of increased nh4 pollution in many regions in china and throughout the developing world increased recycling of human and domestic animal wastes would partially replace chemical fertilizer use on croplands while simultaneously reducing wastewater discharge to river systems strokal et al 2016 remediation strategies to decrease riverine no3 and tn pollution must focus on further reductions in nonpoint source pollution sources and recognize the importance of legacy n sources results of this study in combination with our previous studies chen et al 2014 hu et al 2018 hu et al 2019 confirm the large contribution of nonpoint source pollution derived from legacy n pools originating from soil and groundwater fig 9 legacy n pools accumulated in soil and groundwater from historical applications of excess n are slowly working their way through the soil and groundwater systems to serve as a long term source of riverine n in the yongan river watershed fig 9 legacy n sources are now well known as a considerable long term source of riverine n in many watersheds worldwide chen et al 2018 van meter et al 2016 van meter and basu 2017 thus in addition to n source controls it is warranted to adopt n interception measures along the hydrologic flowpath such as using flow through wetlands riparian buffer strips step pools or other physical modifications to reduce n loading to rivers chen et al 2011 craig et al 2008 utilization of legacy soil n reserves should be considered as a nutrient source for crop production by utilizing soil organic n mineralization as a source of n for crop requirements and or agroforestry practices to extract sequester and recycle deeper soil n sources chen et al 2018 to coped with catchment scale legacy groundwater n pollution restoration of stream and riparian zones is a compelling strategy for enhancing groundwater no3 removal by denitrification boano et al 2014 permeable reactive barrier technology also provides a promising approach for sustainable in situ groundwater restoration that makes use of natural groundwater flows to transport no3 rich groundwater to reactive materials for no3 removal by microbial denitrification liu et al 2013 obiri nyarko et al 2014 4 conclusion herein we demonstrated the efficacy of the wrtds model for evaluating changes in long term riverine n dynamics in response to implementation of pollution control measures in a nitrogen rich river network of eastern china the wrtds model showed satisfactory accuracies for predicting daily riverine total n nh4 and no3 concentrations loads across the 40 year study period 1980 2019 modeled results indicated that riverine nh4 concentration rapidly increased in 1980 2009 and then decreased in 2010 2019 owing to decreased wastewater nh4 loads 2010 2019 from improved wastewater collection treatment although chemical n fertilizer use and domestic animal numbers both decreased in 2000 2019 riverine tn and no3 concentrations continued to increase during the 1980 2019 period this paradox is ascribed to contributions of legacy n from soil and groundwater sources therefore point source pollution control efforts demonstrated improved effectiveness whereas nonpoint source pollution control requires additional efforts especially to address legacy n pollution issues the wrtds model provides a useful tool for identifying long term riverine n pollution trends and sources providing decision makers with critical information for developing optimizing watershed n pollution control strategies credit authorship contribution statement kaibin wu data curation methodology software validation minpeng hu

3617,identification of long term water quality trends in response to watershed anthropogenic interventions is crucial for developing and adapting water pollution control strategies this study represents the first use of the weighted regressions on time discharge and season wrtds model to evaluate trends and sources of riverine nitrogen n levels over the 1980 2019 period in the yongan river watershed of eastern china the wrtds model showed satisfactory accuracies for predicting daily riverine total n tn nh4 and no3 concentrations loads r2 0 55 n 366 modeled flow normalized riverine nh4 concentration increased by 789 from 1980 to 2009 and then decreased by 63 in 2010 2019 this changing trend for riverine nh4 concentration was mainly attributed to a 43 decrease of wastewater nh4 discharge load in 2010 2019 due to establishment of three new wwtps in urban areas and enhanced rural domestic sewage collection treatment although chemical n fertilizer use decreased by 49 and domestic animal numbers decreased by 73 in 2000 2019 flow normalized riverine tn and no3 concentrations progressively increased by 161 and 232 in 1980 2019 respectively the paradox between decreasing n inputs and increasing riverine tn no3 concentrations is attributed to inputs of legacy n from soil and groundwater this is supported by the 3 8 fold increase of riverine no3 concentration in 1980 2019 86 increase in 2000 2019 following 10 days with no precipitation representing groundwater contributions to baseflow and a 4 1 fold increase of riverine no3 concentration in 1980 2019 91 increase in 2000 2019 following the first rainstorm after 10 days of no precipitation representing soil flushing these results document that point source pollution control efforts were effective whereas benefits from nonpoint source pollution control were masked by inputs from legacy n pollution the wrtds model was demonstrated to be a useful tool for assessing long term riverine n pollution dynamics and sources thereby providing decision makers with critical information to guide watershed n pollution control strategies keywords wrtds eutrophication nonpoint source point source legacy nutrients watershed management 1 introduction excessive nitrogen n inputs originating from anthropogenic activities have caused sharp increases in n loadings to surface waters worldwide leading to degradation of aquatic ecosystem health harmful algal bloom and hypoxia anoxia galloway et al 2008 gu et al 2015 over the past several decades many regions and or countries have made tremendous efforts e g improving domestic wastewater treatment reducing fertilizer applications and recycling domestic animal wastes to mitigate aquatic n pollution bernhardt et al 2005 craig et al 2008 ma et al 2020 stets et al 2020 however it is critical to monitor the water quality changes to evaluate the effectiveness of these control actions lee et al 2016 liu et al 2017 sinha and michalak 2016 due to a lag time between implementation of watershed management measures and the river water quality response long term water quality trend analysis is required to fully explore the efficiency of relevant n pollution control efforts meals et al 2010 in general riverine n concentration or load metrics display high daily seasonal and annual variability due to the interaction of natural e g climate and hydrology and anthropogenic factors e g n input density and land use chen et al 2004 choquette et al 2019 sinha and michalak 2016 stets et al 2020 in addition riverine n monitoring data are usually discrete and or sampled with variable intervals such as monthly biweekly or weekly hirsch et al 2010 therefore appropriate statistical approaches are required to detect long term trends in riverine n levels based on discrete monitoring data and to identify the influence of anthropogenic interventions stenback et al 2011 a range of statistical approaches such as nonparametric mann kendall test kendall 1975 sen s slope sen 1968 seasonal sen s slope hirsch et al 1982 generalized additive gam model morton and henderson 2008 load estimator loadest model runkel et al 2004 and weighted regressions on time discharge and season wrtds model hirsch et al 2010 are utilized to quantify trend magnitude changes in riverine n and other water quality indexes p sediment carbon etc from a long term perspective watershed pollution sources land use types and distributions and hydrometeorological patterns are remarkably altered thereby imposing variable relationships between river water quality and hydrology over time hirsch et al 2010 among the above mentioned statistical approaches wrtds utilizes a window regression approach for each day of the estimation period which provides variable coefficients for quantifying changes in water quality trends over long term periods hirsch et al 2010 thus the wrtds model provides a flexible theoretically robust and applicable tool to quantify long term water quality trends over a broad range of conditions hirsch 2014 lee et al 2016 as a conceptually rooted weighted regression model wrtds comprehensively describes characteristics and trends of water quality signals throughout the discharge and time regimes based on discrete monitoring data as well as distinguishing anthropogenic and climate impacts with the flow normalization procedure hirsch et al 2010 hirsch and de cicco 2015 integrating historical information concerning anthropogenic activities with the wrtds can provide critical evidence for identifying the roles of different components e g point nonpoint sources of pollution surface water and groundwater regulating riverine water quality trends hirsch et al 2010 zhang et al 2021 therefore wrtds has been widely applied for assessing water quality trends and sources in the mississippi river watershed sprague et al 2011 susquehanna river basin van meter et al 2017 south fork shenandoah river zhang et al 2021 and grand river watershed van meter and basu 2017 however the wrtds model has not been evaluated to address long term riverine n level trend analyses in china a country with rapidly changing and severe riverine n pollution levels originating from multiple point and nonpoint sources rare works are available to address long term riverine n dynamics in response to multiple water pollution control measures over the past several decades many chinese rivers e g the yangzi river yellow river and pearl river have experienced significant water quality impairment associated with rapid economic development human population expansion urbanization and agricultural intensification chen et al 2004 chen et al 2019 gao et al 2016 huang et al 2021 to control water pollution the chinese government has implemented a range of national level measures zhang and wen 2008 ma et al 2020 such as regulation on the prevention and control of pollution from large scale breeding of livestock and poultry 2014 action plan for water pollution prevention and control 2015 action plan for zero growth in fertilizer use 2015 and toilet revolution plan 2015 in compliance with national policies some local governments issued and implemented more rigorous water pollution control measures for example zhejiang province carried out the 811 eight major river systems and eleven key supervised areas environmental pollution renovation activity since 2005 and the five water wastewater floodwater waterlogging water supply and water saving co treatment program since 2014 to assess the efficacy of these efforts several national or regional assessments of selected rivers and lakes have documented improvements in water quality in recent years huang et al 2021 liu et al 2017 ma et al 2020 these assessments usually addressed water quality trends based on analyses of often limited and or short term monitoring records rendering them unable to identify the efficiencies of individual water pollution control efforts e g extending and improving wwtps adopting fertilizer reduction strategy restricting livestock populations huang et al 2021 ma et al 2020 therefore it is strongly warranted to investigate long term river water quality trends to identify the efficacies of different water pollution control measures to guide future watershed management herein this study represents the first use of the wrtds model to address long term riverine n dynamics in a typical river system the yongan river in eastern china based on a 40 year record 1980 2019 of riverine n tn no3 and nh4 concentrations and river discharge the wrtds model was calibrated to address long term riverine n dynamics our specific objectives were to investigate 1 the applicability of the wrtds model 2 the trends and sources of riverine n pollution and 3 the efficacy of point and nonpoint source pollution control efforts this work assesses long term riverine n dynamics in response to multiple water pollution control measures thereby guiding the development optimization of n management strategies to effectively control excessive riverine n levels to downstream coastal waters 2 method 2 1 watershed description the yongan river watershed 120 13 46 121 0 52 e and 28 28 10 29 2 22 n elevation 15 1000 m is located in the highly developed taizhou area of zhejiang province in eastern china fig 1 it is the third largest river of zhejiang province one of eight major river systems in zhejiang province and flows into taizhou estuary and the east china sea a coastal area that commonly experiences hypoxia gao and zhang 2010 li et al 2007 the sampling location fig 1 for this study was 55 km upstream of taizhou estuary at an elevation of 15 m the river drains a total area of 2474 km2 and has an average annual water depth of 5 42 m and discharge of 72 9 m3 s 1 at the sampling location the climate is subtropical monsoon having average annual precipitation of 1400 mm and an average annual temperature of 17 4 c rainfall mainly occurs in may september with a typhoon season in july september and a dry season from october to february there are no dams or transboundary water withdrawals along the main river channel and no significant trends in annual precipitation amount or average river discharge during the study period table 1 total population within the watershed increased from 590 000 to 770 000 between 1980 and 2019 agricultural land including paddy field garden plot and dry land accounted for 11 17 of total watershed area in 1980 2019 with developed land including rural urban residential lands roads and mining industrial lands woodland and barren land contributing to 2 5 68 72 and 6 17 respectively table 1 to comply with the 811 environmental pollution renovation activity 2005 and five water co treatment program 2014 issued by zhejiang province the taizhou city government implemented a range of measures e g urban and rural infrastructure construction industrial wastewater treatment livestock and poultry breeding regulation application of formula fertilization by soil testing to mitigate water pollution wanting 2017 in the yongan river watershed three new centralized wwtps were established one in 2007 and two in 2010 to treat domestic wastewater and selected industrial wastewaters in urban areas total sewage treatment capacity in the urban area was increased to 4 8 104 ton day 1 with anaerobic anoxic oxic treatment process resulting in a reduction of the annual total nh4 load in wastewater discharge by 43 between 2010 and 2019 fig 2 beginning in 2005 industrial enterprises not connected to centralized wwtps were required to develop independent sewage treatment facilities to meet category ⅰ integrated wastewater discharge standards gb 8978 1996 in rural areas each village 500 in the watershed developed a domestic sewage centralized treatment facility with a capacity of at least 30 ton day 1 since 2000 the watershed experienced a 49 reduction in n fertilizer application and a 73 decrease in the domestic animal population on an equivalent number of pigs basis fig 2 2 2 data sources 2 2 1 water quality and hydrometeorological data river water samples were collected once every 4 8 weeks n 366 at baizhiao station watershed outlet fig 1 during the 1980 2019 study period with bimonthly sampling campaigns mainly during the 1995 1998 and 2003 2012 periods total nitrogen tn nitrate no3 and ammonia nh4 concentrations for the 1980 2012 period were provided by the taizhou city environment protection bureau and monthly data for the october 2014 september 2019 period were collected analyzed by our team a groundwater monitoring well was established 15 m depth fig 1 near baizhiao station and groundwater no3 concentrations were measured monthly for the period of 2014 2019 n 62 mixed river samples three samples across the river cross section and groundwater samples were collected between 8 00 a m and 9 00 a m on each sampling date acidified with h2so4 in the field 10 ml of concentrated h2so4 per liter and analyzed within 4 h of sampling nitrate concentration was determined by the spectrophotometric phenol disulfonic acid method limit of detection lod 0 01 mg n l 1 nh4 by the spectrophotometric salicylic acid method lod 0 02 mg n l 1 tn by persulfate digestion with uv spectrophotometric detection of no3 lod 0 04 mg n l 1 respectively state environmental protection administration of china 2002 daily river discharge and precipitation amounts at three weather monitoring stations within the watershed for the 1980 2019 period were obtained from the local hydrology bureau and weather bureau respectively 2 2 2 anthropogenic nitrogen input data annual livestock and poultry quantities fertilizer application land use types and population data for the 1980 2019 period as well as the nh4 load from municipal sewage and industrial wastewater in the 1996 2019 period fig 2 table 1 were derived from local yearbooks of xianju county and linhai city to address long term changes in livestock populations the number of each domestic animal type was converted into an equivalent number of pigs fig 2 based on their n excretion rates han et al 2014 2 3 weighted regressions on time discharge and season wrtds model calibration this study adopted the wrtds model to estimate daily riverine n concentration and loads from the discrete water quality measurements in the yongan river during 1980 2019 the basic regression equation of wrtds is expressed as hirsch et al 2010 1 ln c β 0 β 1 t β 2 ln q β 3 sin 2 π t β 4 cos 2 π t ε where ln is natural log c is riverine n concentration mg n l 1 t is the time in decimal year q is measured daily average water discharge m3 s 1 β 0 β 4 are fitted coefficients and ε is the unexplained variation the coefficients β 0 β 4 and ε are allowed to vary in a gradual manner throughout the river water discharge and time regimes the wrtds model and its analysis procedures were available as the egret package version 3 0 2 in the r computing framework which were fully described in hirsch and de cicco 2015 according to the data requirements for the wrtds model hirsch et al 2010 the long term data series 40 years from the yongan river having a large number of data points n 366 and daily river water discharge meets the necessary requirements the metrics of coefficient of determination r2 and bias hirsch 2014 hirsch and de cicco 2015 were adopted to assess the performance of the wrtds model calibration wrtds model uses a window approach to give each sampling point a corresponding weight based on the product of weighted values in the three dimensions of time season and ln q the weights were expressed as a function of the distance between the estimation point and the sample points which is measured by the window parameters windowy windows and windowq our previous modeling results for the yongan river watershed indicated that there was a 7 13 year lag time between agricultural anthropogenic n inputs and riverine n export whereas there was a negligible lag time between wastewater n discharge and riverine n export chen et al 2014 hu et al 2018 therefore the parameter windowy was set from 5 years the minimum value of windowy contained 100 observations with nonzero weights hirsch et al 2010 to 15 years to determine the optimal windowy values for simulating river tn nh4 and no3 concentrations based on the model performances r2 and bias values other parameters of the model were set at default values e g 0 5 years for windows and 2 natural log units for windowq in this study using the calibrated wrtds model we obtained comprehensive predictions for tn no3 and nh4 throughout the discharge and time regimes the flow normalized n concentrations loads were estimated as the average of the estimated concentration under the full set of discharge conditions occurring on a given calendar date thereby eliminating the influence of random temporal variability in streamflow when assessing the impacts of relevant anthropogenic interventions the uncertainty analysis was conducted with the wrtds bootstrap test wbt procedure using the egretci r package version 2 0 3 to quantify 90 confidence intervals ci and likelihoods of riverine n trends hirsch et al 2015 using the fn2q approach provided by zhang et al 2021 riverine flow normalized nh4 concentrations and loads were further decomposed into different hydrological conditions i e high and low flows regimes to address potential influencing factors on riverine nh4 dynamics high and low flows regimes represented the upper 50 and the lower 50 of the discharge records respectively to address potential contributions from groundwater and soil n pools annual average riverine no3 concentrations following conditions of 10 day of no precipitation and first rainstorm event 30 mm per 24 hr after a 10 day no precipitation period were estimated for each year by the calibrated wrtds model all correlation and regression analyses e g r2 and coefficient of variation cv were performed using functions in the r computing framework r development core team 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the wrtds model overall the model performances r2 and bias values for simulating river tn and no3 concentrations were relatively stable when windowy values varied between 5 and 15 years fig 3 model performances for nh4 were also stable when the windowy values ranged from 5 to 10 years whereas performance decreased significantly when the windowy value was 10 years these results indicated that the wrtds model performances were not sensitive to windowy values hirsch et al 2010 according to the previously identified lag times 7 13 yr between anthropogenic n inputs and riverine n exports in the yongan river watershed chen et al 2014 hu et al 2018 and the recommended model default values hirsch et al 2010 we selected 13 13 and 5 years as the windowy values for tn no3 and nh4 simulations respectively the calibrated wrtds model provided reasonable results for predicting riverine n concentrations and loads in the yongan river fig 4 the modeled riverine tn nh4 and no3 concentrations as well as loads presented good agreement with observed values r2 0 55 the r2 values between modeled and observed tn nh4 and no3 concentrations or loads fell within the range of estimated r2 values 0 05 0 85 for concentrations and 0 60 0 97 for loads in previous applications of the wrtds model oelsner et al 2017 bias values between observed and modeled tn nh4 and no3 loads were 0 013 0 048 and 0 040 respectively which fell within the acceptable bias range of 0 1 0 1 for the wrtds model hirsch 2014 hirsch and de cicco 2015 determined load bias values in this study were comparable to previous applications of the wrtds model in other river systems 0 044 0 031 for nitrate in the mississippi river sprague et al 2011 0 002 for nitrate in the raccoon river hirsch 2014 0 003 for tn nox in the chesapeake bay watershed zhang et al 2019 and 0 087 0 083 for tn nox concentrations and loads in 471 stream sites across the united states oelsner et al 2017 this pattern indicates that the estimated concentrations and loads were consistent with the observed pattern these results confirm that the calibrated wrtds model was effective for estimating daily concentrations and loads for tn nh4 and no3 in the yongan river over the 1980 2019 period the model performances for n load product of concentration and discharge simulations were better than those of n concentrations fig 4 which is attributed to the higher temporal variability in river discharge than n concentrations table 1 the temporal variability of riverine n loads was also more dependent on water discharge r2 0 50 0 86 than concentrations r2 0 001 0 03 moreover since concentrations were simulated by the wrtds model while discharges were from monitored results performances for modeled loads were generally better than those of concentrations fig 4 the residuals of model results were independent of mean n concentrations or loads with a symmetry around the zero line fig 4c f i p 0 05 and no significant differences with respect to discharge time or seasonal components fig 5 indicating robust model results higher residuals were observed in 1980 2000 which could be attributed to relative higher variability of n concentrations especially for nh4 and no3 table 1 and lower sampling frequency 6 times per year in some years therefore it is warranted to increase n monitoring frequency and or adding storm sampling to improve accuracy in future applications of the wrtds model oelsner et al 2017 3 2 long term change of riverine nh4 level in the yongan river watershed the wrtds model estimated that annual riverine flow normalized nh4 concentration increased from 0 09 90 ci 0 06 0 12 mg n l 1 in 1980 to a peak of 0 80 0 71 0 99 mg n l 1 in 2009 before progressively declining to 0 30 0 13 0 42 mg n l 1 in 2019 fig 6 in 2005 2015 annul average nh4 concentration exceeded the category iii standard for chinese surface waters 0 5 mg n l 1 gb3838 2002 correspondingly the estimated annual riverine flow normalized nh4 load rapidly increased from 2 76 105 1 58 4 04 105 kg n yr 1 in 1980 to reach a peak of 14 45 105 9 82 18 77 105 kg n yr 1 in 2008 and then decreased to 6 50 105 3 27 8 82 105 kg n yr 1 in 2019 the proportion of riverine tn comprised of nh4 increased from 10 in 1980 to 47 in 2009 before declining to 12 in 2019 fig 6 estimated likelihood values 0 99 for flow normalized nh4 concentrations loads showed highly likely increasing trends in the 1980 2009 period and highly likely decreasing trends in the 2009 2019 period fig 6 hirsch et al 2015 in general nh4 is readily adsorbed to soil and river bed substrates by cation exchange reactions craig et al 2008 and or converted to nitrate by soil in stream nitrification hu et al 2019 resulting in low nh4 concentrations in most natural waters therefore anthropogenic point source pollution i e domestic and industrial wastewater discharges is the dominant source of elevated riverine nh4 levels in most cases huang et al 2014 this inference is supported by the dilution pattern observed between riverine nh4 concentration and water discharge i e lower and higher concentrations occurred in high and low flow regimes respectively fig 7 b and fig 8 a additionally the flow normalized nh4 load during the low flow regime r2 0 62 p 0 01 was more dependent on wastewater nh4 discharge load than that during the high flow regime r2 0 46 p 0 01 therefore the mitigation of riverine nh4 pollution in the yongan river watershed was mainly ascribed to improvements in wastewater collection treatment along with some reductions in animal waste runoff owing to reductions in livestock populations the rapid increase in riverine nh4 levels during the 1980 2009 period fig 6 were attributed to increasing industrial and domestic wastewater discharged directly into the river network in the absence of wastewater treatment plants wwtps jin et al 2014 this period of time corresponds to rapid urbanization and industrial development as well as a rapidly increasing population density in the yongan river watershed table 1 consequently annual wastewater nh4 discharge increased by 233 between 1996 and 2010 fig 2 notably the riverine nh4 load increased following the establishment of the first new wwtp in 2007 we ascribe this increased nh4 load to the continuous increase of local wastewater amounts due to rapidly growing population and industries during this time period thereby limiting the observed impacts of the first new wwtp conversely the large decline in riverine nh4 levels during the 2010 2019 period were mainly associated with the 43 decrease in wastewater nh4 discharge load between 2010 and 2019 fig 2 due to construction of three new central wwtps in urban areas as well as enhanced industrial wastewater treatment and improved rural domestic sewage treatment quantitatively the decrease of urban domestic wastewater nh4 discharge corresponds to a reduction in annual average riverine nh4 concentration by 0 1 mg n l 1 20 it is difficult to estimate the contribution of enhanced rural domestic wastewater treatment and individual industrial enterprise wastewater treatment to riverine nh4 concentration however the greater decline in nh4 concentrations in autumn winter 74 than in spring summer 58 during 2010 2019 fig 7b fig 7e supports the importance of wastewater treatment since point source pollution is most strongly expressed in the dormant dry season which is also the low flow regime i e less dilution in this watershed hu et al 2018 overall these results indicate that mitigation of nh4 pollution in the yongan river was strongly improved by implementation of greater wastewater treatment capacity efficiency to reduce point source pollution 3 3 long term changes of riverine tn and no3 levels for the yongan river the wrtds model estimated that annual flow normalized tn concentration continuously increased from 0 89 90 ci 0 85 0 95 mg n l 1 in 1980 to 2 32 2 13 2 58 mg n l 1 in 2019 resulting in a 161 increase 74 increase in 2000 s the increased tn concentrations resulted in a related increase in the annual flow normalized tn load from 1 82 106 kg 1 73 1 95 106 n yr 1 to 4 54 106 3 89 5 17 106 kg n yr 1 fig 6 moreover annual flow normalized no3 concentration increased by 232 over the 40 yr study period fig 6 with a steady increased from 0 37 0 26 0 45 mg n l 1 in 1980 to 1 23 1 11 1 50 mg n l 1 in 2019 86 increase in 2000 s this resulted in a corresponding increase in the annual flow normalized no3 load from 0 90 106 0 62 1 18 106 kg n yr 1 in 1980 to 2 73 106 2 17 3 42 106 kg n yr 1 in 2019 estimated likelihood values 0 99 for flow normalized tn and no3 concentrations loads showed highly likely increasing trends during the study period fig 6 hirsch et al 2015 the ratio of riverine no3 to tn fluctuated within a narrow range of 45 to 50 with a trend for higher proportions since 2012 2019 nitrate is the predominant form of n in many agricultural watersheds because it is highly mobile and readily leached from soils craig et al 2008 resulting in high riverine no3 concentrations usually occurring in high flow regimes fig 7c due to lack of data concerning wastewater no3 and tn loads it was not possible to evaluate the impacts of wwtp facilities on riverine no3 and tn concentrations however the impacts of wwtps on no3 and tn appeared to be limited as indicated by continuous increasing trends in observed riverine no3 and tn concentrations between 2007 and 2019 previous dual stable isotope 15n no3 18o no3 analysis for the yongan river in 2014 2017 indicated that wastewater contributed to 25 15 of the riverine no3 load hu et al 2019 therefore nonpoint source pollution is inferred to be the dominant contribution of riverine no3 tn in the yongan river watershed in contrast to the increasing concentrations of riverine no3 tn annual chemical n fertilizer application decreased by 49 in 2000 2019 and domestic livestock numbers decreased by 73 since 1980 fig 2 such contrasting trends between watershed n source inputs and riverine no3 tn levels are attributed to contributions of legacy n accumulated in soils and groundwater that have a purported lag time of 7 13 years in the yongan river watershed chen et al 2014 huang et al 2014 hu et al 2018 the wrtds model estimated annual average riverine no3 concentration for the 10 day no precipitation condition increased 3 8 fold between 1980 and 2019 86 increase observed in 2000 2019 fig 9 a in the yongan river watershed this implies an increasing contribution of groundwater n to riverine n loads during stable baseflow conditions chen et al 2014 hu et al 2018 van meter et al 2016 this is supported by an increasing no3 concentration in groundwater near the outlet of the watershed during the 2014 2019 period fig 9b furthermore the annual average no3 concentration for the first rainstorm events after 10 days with no precipitation associated with soil profile flushing increased 4 1 fold in the 1980 2019 period 91 increase in 2000 2019 fig 9a the average riverine no3 concentration for the first rainstorm event after 10 day with no precipitation 0 99 mg n l 1 was 18 higher than that observed for the 10 day no precipitation condition 0 83 mg n l 1 during the past 10 years these results are attributed to an increasing n contribution from soil organic n mineralization to riverine n pollution in recent years dry antecedent conditions allow accumulation of mineral n from soil organic n mineralization that is subsequently leached from the soil profile to surface waters during rainstorm events kopáček et al 2013 xiang et al 2008 previous modeling and dual isotope 2h h2o 18o h2o studies in the yongan river watershed indicated that slow subsurface flow and groundwater contributed 75 of annual river discharge with a mean transit time of 4 5 yr and contributed 58 81 of the riverine tn load through groundwater transport hu et al 2018 hu et al 2019 hu et al 2020 our dual stable isotope 15n no3 18o no3 analysis for the yongan river from 2014 to 2017 further demonstrated that soil and groundwater sources contributed 33 8 and 43 17 of riverine no3 loads respectively hu et al 2019 a previous modeling study similarly predicted that soil organic n mineralization and release contributed 35 on average to riverine tn export load in the yongan river watershed during the 1980 2009 period chen et al 2014 increasing contributions of soil and groundwater legacy n pools to riverine no3 loads are also supported by decreasing coefficients of variance for monthly no3 concentrations in the 2000 2019 period p 0 01 additionally there was no significant seasonal variation in the rate of increase for no3 concentrations during this period fig 7f collectively these data modeling results suggest that soil and groundwater legacy n sources mask any response of riverine no3 tn concentrations to nonpoint source pollution control measures in the yongan river watershed 3 4 implications for riverine n pollution control for the yongan river watershed the wrtds model confirmed the efficacy of point source pollution control efforts as demonstrated by decreased riverine nh4 levels resulting from improvements in urban industrial and rural wastewater treatment conversely the model did not detect improvements in nonpoint source pollution control as riverine no3 and tn levels continued to increase over the study period despite the appreciable reductions in nh4 point source inputs riverine nh4 concentration was not able to meet category iii ⅴ water quality standards chinese national criteria during the low mid discharge regimes in spring when dilution capacity was low fig 7b high nh4 concentrations in surface waters pose appreciably risks to downstream aquatic ecosystems such as ammonia toxicity eutrophication and hypoxia resulting from oxygen consumption during nitrification camargo and alonso 2006 therefore wastewater collection and treatment should be further enhanced with a particular focus on rural areas where wastewater collection treatment is not fully implemented decreased recycling of human and animal excreta as an agricultural nutrient source over the past several decades gu et al 2015 and the lack of efficient sewage collection treatment in rural areas chen et al 2013 are major causes of increased nh4 pollution in many regions in china and throughout the developing world increased recycling of human and domestic animal wastes would partially replace chemical fertilizer use on croplands while simultaneously reducing wastewater discharge to river systems strokal et al 2016 remediation strategies to decrease riverine no3 and tn pollution must focus on further reductions in nonpoint source pollution sources and recognize the importance of legacy n sources results of this study in combination with our previous studies chen et al 2014 hu et al 2018 hu et al 2019 confirm the large contribution of nonpoint source pollution derived from legacy n pools originating from soil and groundwater fig 9 legacy n pools accumulated in soil and groundwater from historical applications of excess n are slowly working their way through the soil and groundwater systems to serve as a long term source of riverine n in the yongan river watershed fig 9 legacy n sources are now well known as a considerable long term source of riverine n in many watersheds worldwide chen et al 2018 van meter et al 2016 van meter and basu 2017 thus in addition to n source controls it is warranted to adopt n interception measures along the hydrologic flowpath such as using flow through wetlands riparian buffer strips step pools or other physical modifications to reduce n loading to rivers chen et al 2011 craig et al 2008 utilization of legacy soil n reserves should be considered as a nutrient source for crop production by utilizing soil organic n mineralization as a source of n for crop requirements and or agroforestry practices to extract sequester and recycle deeper soil n sources chen et al 2018 to coped with catchment scale legacy groundwater n pollution restoration of stream and riparian zones is a compelling strategy for enhancing groundwater no3 removal by denitrification boano et al 2014 permeable reactive barrier technology also provides a promising approach for sustainable in situ groundwater restoration that makes use of natural groundwater flows to transport no3 rich groundwater to reactive materials for no3 removal by microbial denitrification liu et al 2013 obiri nyarko et al 2014 4 conclusion herein we demonstrated the efficacy of the wrtds model for evaluating changes in long term riverine n dynamics in response to implementation of pollution control measures in a nitrogen rich river network of eastern china the wrtds model showed satisfactory accuracies for predicting daily riverine total n nh4 and no3 concentrations loads across the 40 year study period 1980 2019 modeled results indicated that riverine nh4 concentration rapidly increased in 1980 2009 and then decreased in 2010 2019 owing to decreased wastewater nh4 loads 2010 2019 from improved wastewater collection treatment although chemical n fertilizer use and domestic animal numbers both decreased in 2000 2019 riverine tn and no3 concentrations continued to increase during the 1980 2019 period this paradox is ascribed to contributions of legacy n from soil and groundwater sources therefore point source pollution control efforts demonstrated improved effectiveness whereas nonpoint source pollution control requires additional efforts especially to address legacy n pollution issues the wrtds model provides a useful tool for identifying long term riverine n pollution trends and sources providing decision makers with critical information for developing optimizing watershed n pollution control strategies credit authorship contribution statement kaibin wu data curation methodology software validation minpeng hu

3618,a robust quantitative assessment of water security through efficient water accounting concepts like blue and green water footprints has gained a lot of attention for water resources management at river basin scale however such water accounting tools and models have dependencies to the choice of precipitation data used to drive the model as the input bias propagate into simulated streamflow through interaction with different hydrological processes this study performs a holistic investigation of sensitivity of water accounting fractions like blue water flow bwf green water flow gwf green water storage gws and their dependencies on secondary precipitation datasets spds choices using a lumped conceptual rainfall runoff model hydrological simulation model hysim and a physically based semi distributed hydrological model soil and water assessment tool swat in the damodar river basin india these models were driven by seven gridded precipitation datasets including india meteorological department imd data indian monsoon data assimilation and analysis imdaa data asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation aphrodite data watch forcing era interim data climate hazard group infrared precipitation with station data chirps princeton precipitation data and precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural network climate data records persiann cdr data the reference imd based multimodel results revealed that the annual average blue and green water components of the damoder river were in the range of 558 656 mm year 574 728 mm year and 34 112 mm year for bwf gwf and gws respectively during 1994 2010 period the results obtained after applying parameter transferability approach across the input space have revealed exact quantification of choice dependent annual variations in spatial and temporal characteristics of bwf gwf and gws a further evaluation based on error propagation ratios γcc γrrmse γb has revealed a quantification of input choice induced dampening magnification effects on flow estimations of both the hysim and swat and these quantifications were free from the compensation effects of recalibration the findings in this study demonstrate that the change in annual average bwf varies between 46 97 to 41 38 in comparison to benchmark imd simulations and the corresponding changes for gwf is between 19 63 and 17 06 and for gws is between 29 97 to 35 5 with different choices of spd scenarios the systematic γb and random γrrmse error propagation factors during monsoon season are larger for swat model 0 21 0 78 0 69 0 89 respectively than that of hysim model 0 18 0 74 0 66 0 81 respectively and it is varying with choice of different spds keywords input dependency precipitation uncertainty parameter transferability error propagation damodar river india 1 introduction water management is an important human engineering intervention as water scarcity has grown as a worldwide problem making impacts on both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems efficient accounting of available water and use of rainwater is very important for effective water management in river basins looking into competition for water resources among agriculture livestock energy and other sectors though many conventional water resource assessment methods are available in water research an approach that conceptually divides freshwater into green water resources and blue water resources has gained a lot of attention after a work of falkenmark 1995 in which the terms green versus blue water use was first time introduced previous literature has highlighted that the estimation of blue water and green water plays an important role in freshwater availability and water security assessment studies for better water resources management falkenmark 2013 hoekstra 2014 in recent years researchers have studied the impact of climate variability and land use land cover changes on blue water and green water resources for assessment of water security at global scale as well as at river basin scale veettil and mishra 2018 veettil and mishra 2016 yuan et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b the commonly suited models for the estimation of runoff calculation and blue water green water resources assessments are soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 variable infiltration capacity vic hydrological simulation model hysim remesan et al 2019 a study by veettil and mishra 2018 investigated the impact of climate and anthropogenic variability on blue and green water scarcity in the savannah river basin using swat model some studies have focused on swat model for estimation of bwf and gwf in erhai lake basin yuan et al 2019 and ganjiang river basin zhang et al 2020b respectively the hysim is a relatively simple conceptual rainfall runoff model that has been extensively used for water accounting and runoff modeling in the europe harris et al 2013 and india remesan and holman 2015 whereas swat is a widely accepted physically based semi distributed model conceptual hydrological models based on the conceptualization of rainfall to runoff generation process which do not explicitly consider energy fluxes and thus mimic physical processes in a simplified manner liu et al 2017b conversely the physically based hydrological models based on scientific principle of water and energy fluxes describe the physical processes occurring within the catchment by solving differential equations for representation of mass momentum and energy conservation abbott et al 1986 although all the hydrological models are simplifications of complex real systems there are conflicting modelling philosophies in the hydrologic community about conceptual lumped models and physically based models sahoo and sahoo 2020 past studies feng et al 2019 were also claimed that a hydrological model could reproduce observed streamflow correctly by improper estimation of lateral flow evaporation deep percolation and shallow ground water flow occurring in a catchment chilkoti et al 2019 hence it will be an interesting research area to explore the computation of blue and green water dynamics in any typical river basin with solving the water balance components by incorporating structurally distinct two hydrological models lumped conceptual model hysim and semi distributed physically based model swat additionally the hydrological studies were also directly affected by the reduction in the number of in situ measurements sahoo et al 2020 to a greater extent among those precipitation is one of the most important components of hydrological modelling as its spatiotemporal variability significantly affects water resources availability and hydrological behaviour in any typical river basin pang et al 2020 panda et al 2021 of course the measurement of the precipitation by rain gauge was significantly affected due to i high cost and time involvements darand et al 2017 ii data accessibility issues in remote locations and iii theft of sensors although the precipitation measurement could also be done by weather radar and satellite observations liu et al 2017a zhang et al 2020a weather radar observations can only provide spatial coverage of 300 km from radar sites moreover these precipitation products are typically subject to number of constraints including beam height variation and massive power consumption zhang et al 2020a to alleviate all these aforementioned limitations related to rain gauge and weather radar measurement alazzy et al 2017 recently the remotely sensed satellite observations and reanalysis precipitation datasets jointly termed as secondary precipitation datasets spds have been gaining its popularity for wide application in hydrological modeling studies there are several spds available at finer spatial 0 05 to 0 5 and temporal 3 hourly or daily resolutions over global or quasi global scale among the freely accessible spds the commonly used datasets are indian monsoon data assimilation and analysis imdaa rani et al 2021 asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation aphrodite yatagai et al 2012 watch forcing data era interim wfdei weedon et al 2014 v climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps funk et al 2015 vi princeton sheffield et al 2006 vii precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural network persiann cdr ashouri et al 2015 the accuracy of these spds are highly dependent on regional topography climate and precipitation type darand et al 2017 due to measurement errors arising from sampling techniques and errors in spds musie et al 2019 therefore the performance and accuracy of spds should be properly assessed with reference to regional and basin scale instead of global scale for improvement in satellite retrieval algorithm alazzy et al 2017 and also for identification of suitable dataset which can be used for hydrological modelling studies subsequently helps in water resources decision making studies musie et al 2019 several research have been carried out to evaluate the accuracy of spds by comparing them with rain gauge based precipitation datasets using statistical measures and also to investigate the performance of different spds in streamflow simulation using hydrological models liu et al 2017a pang et al 2020 venkatesh et al 2020 for instance wong et al 2017 performed an inter comparison between gridded precipitation datasets princeton wfdei and narr against rain gauge observation data and calculated the error distribution of gridded precipitation datasets over different terrestrial zones in canada similarly the comprehensive performance of 36 spds available over iran were also investigated by saemian et al 2021 with reference to streamflow simulation using swat model 16 spds were also evaluated at the tungabhadra river basin of india by venkatesh et al 2020 even though earlier studies explored the significance of the available spds for streamflow simulation using various hydrological models the reliability of these spds for blue and green water computation are still unexplored of course streamflow is a vital component in the hydrological cycle it is also important to study the uncertainty of other water balance components evapotranspiration and soil moisture due to changes in precipitation datasets for basin scale water availability assessment following all these inherent research queries this study aims to provide an insight of the interconnection between green and blue water dynamics through two widely accepted hydrological modeling schemes hysim and swat and their dependency on the choice of precipitation input space in most of the previous literatures india meteorological department imd dataset has been considered as a standard benchmarking data for evaluation of spds in india and widely applied for inter comparison of globally available spds gupta et al 2020 a monte carlo assessment based approach has been proposed by hong et al 2006 to investigate precipitation error propagation into hydrological simulations ensemble streamflow error statistics based approach was used to study error propagation in the tocantins araguaia basin in brazil falck et al 2015 ratios of precipitation to streamflow simulation error metrics are another way to represent precipitation error propagation as presented by mei et al 2016 the focus area of this study is the damodar valley in upstream of durgapur barrage located in west bengal and jharkhand provinces of india proper quantification of upstream water availability is essential in the durgapur barrage region as it is a major infrastructure constructed as part of damodar valley project dvp with broader aims like monsoon months flood control dry winter irrigation hydroelectricity generation ghosh 2011 many studies have highlighted that the recognition of how the modeller s subjective choice of meteorological data makes an influence on baseline and future uncertainty of hydrological simulations is vital for all water accounting studies momblanch et al 2019 remesan and holman 2015 liersch et al 2020 although several number of freely available spds accessible nowadays limited studies investigated decencies of these precipitation products on green water blue water redistribution at the river basin scale additionally it can yield interesting research knowledge on hydrological models i e lumped and distributed model behaviour if we combine parameter transferability concept to quantify the influence of input choices on streamflow blue and green water computation even in sparsely gauged river basins as here we have chosen damodar river basin these model behaviors can be translated error propagation indexes to get a wider understanding of the uncertainties in multimodel simulations due to modeller choice on precipitation data products considering these above mentioned scope of study this work has addressed the following research questions i how close is the choice of global regional gridded secondary precipitation datasets spds i e imdaa aphrodite wfdei chirps princeton persiann cdr considering the imd precipitation dataset as the benchmark data for india ii how efficiently and effectively the hydrological models viz hysim and swat can simulate green and blue water dynamics using the selected precipitation datasets in the damodar river basin while calibrating hydrological models with benchmark imd precipitation dataset iii how does the precipitation error propagate through the hydrologic model simulation to green and blue water quantification considering parameter transferability approach iv how the modeler s subjectivity on choice of precipitation data products influences the spatiotemporal details of bwf gwf and gws by hysim and swat 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area this present study was carried out in the damodar river basin situated in eastern india the damodar river basin a part of the ganges river system lies between 84 30 to 88 15 east longitude and 22 15 to 24 30 north longitude the length of the damodar river is 592 km and the drainage area of the basin is 23 380 km2 it originates from khamarpat hill at the trijunction of palamu ranchi and hazaribag district of jharkhand the river basin extends over hazaribag ramgarh koderma giridh dhanbad bokaro and chatra districts in jharkhand burdwan and hooghly districts in west bengal and joins the river hooghly at 50 km below kolkata the upper part of the damodar river basin extends over the state of jharkhand and the lower fan deltaic basin spreads over the state of west bengal singh et al 2020 for controlling the monsoon flood in lower catchment damodar valley corporation dvc constructed four dams and 1 barrage viz tilaya dam on barakar river 1953 konar dam on konar river 1955 maithon on barakar river 1955 panchet 1959 and durgapur barrage 1955 on the damodar river ghosh and guchhait 2016 durgapur barrage is the last hydraulic structure in the river reach which supply irrigation water to burdwan bankura and hoogly district and also control river flow to the downstream side of damodar river basin singh et al 2020 two main canals right bank canal 88 5 km length and left bank canal 136 8 km length originate from durgapur barrage form a large network of main and branch canals with an accumulated length of 2494 km supply water for domestic and industrial purpose in the different stretches of the river the whole durgapur township with approximately 5 22 lakh population is dependent on this barrage for water supply so management of water resources in this location is very important in the context of increasing demand of water for agricultural domestic and industrial needs the location map of the damodar river basin up to durgapur barrage is shown in fig 1 the annual rainfall of this basin ranges from 1000 mm to 1850 mm verma et al 2017 and temperature ranges from 40 c to 42 c in summer season and 23 c to 26 c in winter season 2 2 meteorological data the hysim model use sub basin average precipitation and potential evapotranspiration as input data in this study sub basin average precipitation and potential evapotranspiration have been calculated using the thiessen polygon method whereas the daily potential evapotranspiration has been calculated using the hargreaves method the input meteorological data required by swat are precipitation maximum temperature minimum temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed maximum and minimum daily temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed data were obtained from climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr at a resolution of 0 312 x0 312 in this study seven precipitation datasets from 1994 to 2010 were adopted for the hysim and swat model simulation these datasets were i imd observed gridded

datasets maximum and minimum daily temperature relative humidity solar radiation wind speed data imdaa and wfdei have been regridded to 0 25 spatial resolution using the bilinear interpolation method for maintaining equivalent spatial resolution along with reliable comparison the bilinear interpolation was adopted herein due to its inherent capability to handle the climate datasets during regridding almazroui et al 2020 2017 sharmila et al 2015 turner and annamalai 2012 2 3 spatial data and hydrological data besides meteorological data swat model requires digital elevation model dem land use map and soil map the dem with 30 m resolution used in this study was obtained from the advanced space borne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster https asterweb jpl nasa gov gdem asp the land use land cover data with 100 m spatial resolution was acquired from the oak ridge national laboratory distributed active archive center ornal daac the national aeronautics and space administration nasa earth observing system data and information system eosdis data centers managed by the earth science data and information system esdis project roy et al 2015 the soil map used in this study was collected from food and agriculture organization fao at a spatial resolution of 30 m 30 m the daily observed streamflow data 1991 2018 from durgapur barrage has been collected from the irrigation and water department govt of west bengal 3 methodology the overall methodology adopted in this study was illustrated in fig 2 3 1 statistical evaluation of gridded precipitation products the six precipitation datasets were statistically evaluated against imd observed data considering the following statistical metrices correlation co efficient cc mean error me root mean square error rmse and percentage bias pbias as enlisted in table 2 3 2 hysim setup the hysim is a continuous conceptual lumped rainfall runoff model that simulates hydrological cycle surface runoff percolation to groundwater river flow of a river basin at daily and sub daily time step manley and water resource associates ltd 2006 in general the hysim uses sub basin average precipitation potential evapotranspiration and temperature based snowmelt as input data for the simulation of streamflow in a river basin the model integrates the hydrology and hydraulics parameters in a conceptual framework which describes river basin and channel characteristics the hydrological parameters are represented by seven natural storages snow interception upper soil horizon lower soil horizon transitional groundwater groundwater and minor channels while the hydraulic parameters use kinematic routing of river flows murphy and charlton 2006 the river basin can be partitioned into number of sub basins which can be further sub divided into at most three hydrological zones consisting of homogenous soil type and meteorology in this study the damodar river basin has been sub divided into three hydrological zones depending upon the position of the streamflow data available 3 3 swat setup swat is a semi distributed physically based hydrologic river basin scale continuous model operates at daily and sub daily time step it predicts climate change and land use change impact on hydrological processes sediment yield and agricultural chemical yield in large complex river basins eckhardt et al 2005 the model divides any given basin into many sub basins and each sub basin is further divided into hydrological response units hrus which is an identical combination of land use soil type and surface slope the hydrological cycle simulation in swat is based on water balance equation as shown in eq 1 1 s w t s w 0 i 1 t r day q surf e a w seep q gw i where s w t mm is the final soil water content s w 0 mm is the initial soil water content on day i t days is time r day mm is the precipitation amount on day i q surf mm is the amount of surface runoff on day i e a mm is the evapotranspiration et amount on day i w seep is the amount of water entering the vadose zone from the soil profile on day i and q gw mm is the amount of groundwater flow on day i for computing flow routing through the channel muskingum method was selected and the penman monteith equation was adopted for the estimation of potential evapotranspiration the modified soil conservation service runoff curve number scs cn has been chosen for estimating surface runoff volume in this study damodar river basins have been divided into 31 subbasins including 448 hrus though there may be loss of information about the river basin landscape a non zero hru threshold approach was applied that consist of land cover 5 soil 10 and slope 10 in defining hrus to improve the computational efficiency and these values been chosen within the range of 5 to 15 srinivasan et al 2010 these values were chosen because these are the commonly used threshold ranges which carries minor information losses in water yield and streamflow simulations by the swat model her et al 2015 as proper reservoir representation is absent in the hysim model remesan and holman 2015 the comparison of the hysim and swat models have been done by considering naturalized flow conditions for the simulation of streamflow along with bwf gwf and gws 3 4 model calibration validation and evaluation both the hysim and swat were calibrated for 12 years 1991 2004 at a daily step against the observed streamflow at the catchment outlet durgapur barrage first three years 1991 1993 were used for model warm up period for both models after calibration these two models were validated for six years 2005 2010 the reduced error of estimate technique has been implemented for calibration of five parameters remesan et al 2019 remesan and holman 2015 in hysim although there are two additional snow related hydrological parameters snow temperature threshold snowmelt rate for each degree of temperature above the threshold this study considered five calibrating parameters with reference to the geographical location of the river basin tropical climatic zone the whole river basin is not experienced any snow events throughout the year during our study period 1991 2010 the calibrated parameters and their values for hysim are shown in table 3 sequential uncertainty fitting ver 2 sufi 2 a semi automated algorithm in swat cup swat calibration and uncertainty produces daggupati et al 2015 was used in this study for calibration of swat to quantify the parameter uncertainty of the streamflow modeling the prescribed range of swat calibrated parameters are listed in table 4 the performance of these two models for streamflow simulation were evaluated using three statistical indices nash sutcliffe efficiency nse co efficient of determination r2 and percent bias pbias as presented in table 2 3 5 parameter transferability across inputs experiment scenario design transferability is the ability of a hydrological model calibrated for one time location or input space to produce realistic results at another time location and or meteorological forcing input space it is a general consideration that calibrated parameters cannot be transferred without recalibration to a different model setting with new data source changes in temporal or spatial nature of data cullmann et al 2006 in most climate change scenario hydrological studies there is an implicit assumption that the parameters are calibrated based on baseline observations remain valid for future climatic conditions too a study by remesan et al 2015 argues that the recalibration process will effectively modify hydrological parameters and it compensates all uncertainties in input data and hide how the input choice made by the modeler influenced the modeling results thus here to study the effect of different precipitation sources on the swat and hysim model outputs and how it influences the redistribution of water between various runoff components green and blue we have built different scenarios after transferring parameters calibrated at imd observed precipitation across new model input settings i e replacing imd observed precipitation data with imdaa aphrodite wfdei chirps princeton persiann cdr other data inputs were kept same without recalibration the scenario based simulation has been adopted for both hysim and swat model simulations to know precipitation source dependencies on streamflow simulation bwf gwf and gws 12 parameter transferability scenarios presented in table 5 were considered using imdaa aphrodite wfdei chirps princeton persiann cdr precipitation datasets after parameter transfer from calibrated and validated reference hysim and swat model based on imd observed precipitation data set 3 6 estimation of error translation from precipitation to simulated streamflow for this purpose we have introduced an error propagation ratio metric as suggested by mei et al 2016 2 γ em r em p in eq 2 emp and emr are the estimated error metrics i e based on cc γcc based on rrmse γrrmse and based on absolute value of bias γb for precipitation sets and runoff simulations respectively the equations used to calculate cc rrmse and absolute value of bias are also shown in table 2 though these metrics have deficiencies like i focus is only on absolute error values ii ignoring systematic error and iii focus are only on precipitation and runoff etc it can tell whether precipitation error effect is dampening or amplifying when it is transforming from rainfall to runoff this scenario based error propagation assessment is free from the magnitude effect of parameters we have used the same parameter values calibrated based on reference imd observed data as described in section 3 5 as majority of rainfall events occurred during monsoon season at tropical river basin this analysis was performed with specific focus on monsoon season in streamflow magnitude 3 7 estimation of blue and green water in this study bwf was calculated as the summation of model simulated surface runoff subsurface runoff and groundwater recharge mao et al 2020 green water can be classified into two components gwf and gws gwf is the actual evapotranspiration which is defined as the loss of water distributed to the atmosphere by evaporation from water and soil and transpiration from vegetation cover aghakhani afshar et al 2018 whereas gws is the water content in the soil profile which is available for crop growth veettil and mishra 2018 after integrating all the hydrological components using two distinct hydrological models the blue and green water computation were carried out in this study 4 results 4 1 comparison of secondary precipitation products with imd data as the imd observed gridded precipitation dataset has used more land based observations the present study has considered imd data as a benchmark dataset for inter comparison of spds and for building the reference hydrological models fig 3 represents the spatial variation of average annual precipitation for six spds along with imd observed precipitation data when comparing the average annual precipitation occurred over the damodar river basin fig 3 these spds exhibited similar patterns that revealed an increasing trend of precipitation magnitude from northwest to southeast direction the annual average precipitation for imdaa dataset was larger than imd observed precipitation data as well as other five spds concurrently the intra annual variation of six spds along with imd observation were also analysed using the boxplot as illustrated in fig 4 as the study area receives 70 75 of its rainfall during southeast monsoon period the study mainly amplifies the analysis during monsoon season as magnified in fig 4 although all the six spds were correctly anticipated the timing of monsoon the consistency of these products were varied remarkably with the imd observed data the imdaa aphrodite and wfdei have more consistency with imd observed gridded dataset compared to chrips princeton and persiann cdr datasets the chirps princeton and persiann cdr datasets always underestimated precipitation amount in the monsoon season by about 941 55 mm 863 27 mm and 1323 23 mm on average respectively to reveal the uncertainty and variability of precipitation data products the variation of six spds against imd observed dataset in monsoon season were demonstrated using q q plots and scatter plots fig 5 four statistical indices me cc rmse and pbias were also calculated to quantify the error in spds compared to imd precipitation dataset as illustrated in fig 5 the observations using the q q plot fig 5 was also symmetrical with the previous analysis which signifies three spds aphrodite wfdei imdaa were showing better correlation compared to the rest spds chirps persiann cdr princeton the aphrodite dataset matches the best when compared with imd observed dataset with cc 0 8 and rmse 6 73 followed by wfdei cc 0 53 and rmse 9 75 and imdaa cc 0 48 and rmse 10 67 compared to other three spds chirps persiann cdr princeton all the aforementioned analysis revealed that the princeton product had the least performance over the damodar river basin with cc 0 09 and rmse 16 4 thus it can be inferred that a significant difference was noticed between the six spds when compared with the imd observed dataset using statistical metrices therefore when a modeler decides to choose any of these precipitation products for hydrological applications the errors associated with these products will propagate to the simulated hydrological outcomes subsequently the present study also investigated those error propagation while using the spds for hydrological model simulation as elaborated in the subsequent sections 4 2 reference imd data based hysim and swat simulations and spatial analysis of bwf gwf and gws following the proposed framework for scenario simulation as described in section 3 5 the study initiated its reference simulation using benchmark imd observed datasets for calibration and validation the observed streamflow has been compared with simulated streamflow data from each of the two models at the catchment outlet location durgapur barrage hence the proposed plan was executed using imd observed precipitation data and the time series plot of observed and simulated flow for two models were shown in fig 6 which indicates that the temporal pattern of streamflow hydrograph was well evaluated by the hysim and swat in both calibration and validation period subsequently the performance of the models was evaluated using nse and r2 which signifies the satisfactory performance of the models with the observed streamflow the pbias values represent that both models overestimated observed streamflow in calibration period and can be rated as satisfactory as it is in the range of 12 the overall analysis of result based on all three statistical indicators showed that during streamflow simulation the hysim outperformed swat model in both calibration and validation period after simulating the streamflow other hydrological components were also analysed which were again utilized for blue and green water simulation subsequently the spatial variability of mean annual bwf gwf and gws with respect to imd observed precipitation dataset were computed and presented in fig 7 for the hysim and swat models the annual average bwf was ranging from 317 65 mm to 605 54 mm and 502 85 mm to 835 65 mm for the hysim and swat model respectively the spatial variability of bwf gwf and gws revealed that the swat model was more efficiently representing the spatial heterogeneity of blue and green water resources at subbasin scale compared to the hysim model as swat splits the whole river basin into 31 subbasins whereas the hysim model divides the same into atmost three sub basins 4 3 scenario simulations and streamflow inter comparisons with reference imd hysim and swat models with reference to the intercomparison between the parameter transferability scenarios table 5 the six spds were again used as precipitation inputs for previously imd calibrated hysim and swat models the calibration 1991 2004 and validation period 2005 2010 of these scenarios were also remained consistent with the reference scenario the nse and r2 values table 6 in hi ha hw si sa and sw scenarios indicate that the performance of both models were better in case of imdaa aphrodite and wfdei precipitation product compared to chirps princeton and persiann cdr precipitation product during both calibration and validation period analysing the statistical metrices and model performances in desired scenarios the adopted parameter transferability approaches are working efficiently in this context the transferability of model parameters from the imd precipitation based input space to that of imdaa aphrodite and wfdei based input space was relatively stable compared to that of chirps princeton and persiann cdr data products the least performance scenarios hc hp hpr sc sp and spr were also noticed having high biases and low nse for both calibration and validation period precisely these hydrological comparative metric values indicating how the consequence of the fixed parameterization imd based with choices of different spds manifest significantly on hydrological model behavior and performance during the historical baseline period to test the model prediction reliability the quantile quantile plot of model simulated discharge for both models driven by six spds were illustrated in fig 8 it was clear from of fig 8 that huge uncertainty exists from different choices of precipitation inputs to the hysim and swat model simulation outputs to investigate the reproducibility of the streamflow from the pecribed scenarios flow duration curve fdc analysis was also carried out herein fig 9 of course this fdc analysis help to represent the runoff variability irrespective of the occurrence of the events reproduced by the user defined scenario simulations sahoo et al 2020 4 4 how parameter transferability across input space with different meteorological forcing affects bwf gwf and gws to see the influence of the precipitation choice on redistribution of water within the model with respect to that fixed imd parameterization the month wise details of percent bias comparison between simulated average monthly streamflow for hysim and swat model along with green water blue water distributions were envisaged in fig 10 more statistical details were provided in the supplementary material these figures revealed the changes in the redistribution of water at damodar river basin with input choices precipitation in parameter transferability approach which usually be hidden or compensated with recalibrated parameters the changes in spatial distribution of bwf gwf and gws with respect to the reference imd hysim and swat model were shown in figs 11 and 12 as aphrodite imdaa and wfdei datasets were showing better performance than other precipitation datasets in the case of precipitation evaluation and streamflow simulation only these three spds were considered for spatial heterogeneity representation of bwf gwf and gws simulations hence the spatial distribution of bwf gwf and gws for hi ha hw si sa sw scenarios were represented in figs 11 and 12 as shown in figs 11 and 12 parameter transferability also has a significant impact on bwf and gwf distribution for both hysim and swat models the si and sw scenario results in overestimation of bwf distribution in the middle and lower part of the river basin whereas the sa scenario showed underestimation in bwf throughout the river basin the percentage change in gwf for all six scenarios ha hi hw sa si and sw signifies that the spatial heterogeneity in gwf distribution was relatively small compared to bwf distribution the overestimation in gwf was observed in the case of si 2 74 22 75 and sw 5 42 26 41 scenarios on the other hand a mixed signal was noticed in case of sa scenario 6 62 10 64 where both increase and decrease in gwf was observed for the entire river basin the sa si and sw scenario depicted gws distribution similar to the reference swat model with smaller percentage change varies from 6 69 2 32 0 44 10 24 and 4 53 10 83 respectively indicating model parameter transferability across new input space does not significantly impact gws distribution hence the sensitivity of bwf and gwf to precipitation datasets for both the hysim and swat model were performed as illistrated in fig 13 interestingly the scenario based simulations followed by corresponding scenario based bwf and gwf computation analysis suggested that precipitation variability directly influence the blue and green water distribution throughout the basin hence the sensitivity results signify that bwf was more sensitive to precipitation datasets compared to gwf the correlation coefficients were always higher than 0 64 for bwf fig 13 conversely the lower correlation coefficient in case of swat model and negative coorelation for hysim model between gwf and precipitation datasets implied that precipitation datasets had less control over gwf 4 5 quantification of precipitation error propagation to runoff simulations different indices i e based on cc γcc based on rrmse γrrmse and based on absolute value of bias γb were used for rendering the error propagation from different precipitation to runoff the rainfall runoff error transformation in monsoon season for twelve scenarios are explained in the fig 14 it was indicating the details of dampening and magnification of the error propagation for twelve scenarios hi ha hw hc hp hpr si sa sw sc sp spr the value of γcc was greater than 1 highlighting to improvement from precipitation to streamflow lower interquartile range of γcc has been observed in the case of hi ha hw si sa and sw scenarios compared to other scenarios the error propagation in terms of γrrmse for all four scenarios was shown in fig 14 b the values of γrrmse were below 1 which indicated dampening effect on random error of rainfall to streamflow values for all twelve scenarios demonstrating the rigour of both hydrological model s structure to translate precipiation to streamflow the propagation ratio based on absolute bias value γb for ha hpr sc and spr scenario were below 1 indicating dampening effect of systematic error when translating the precipitation into runoff however the value of γb for other scenarios ranged from 0 to 1 75 implying that there was no adequate information of the direction to either damening or amplifying the systematic error of precipitation to runoff 5 discussion and conclusions this study compared and statistically evaluated the performance of six high resolution gridded spds against reference imd data and analyzed the impact of spds on bwf gwf and gws in the damodar river basin india in the aforementioned results the statistical evaluation of six spds revealed that the aphrodite precipitation dataset was highly correlated to imd observed gridded precipitation product compared to other spds similar findings were also noticed in previous literature for better capability of aphrodite dataset in capturing daily precipitation in india bhattacharyya and sreekesh 2021 prakash et al 2015 rana et al 2015 the possible reason behind the high correlation of aphrodite datasets with imd observed gridded data was due to availability of dense network of rain gauge data over asia source climatedataguide ucar edu among the spds imdaa and wfdei products showed better performance than chirps princeton and persiann cdr datasets ashrit et al 2020 mentioned in their study that the spatiotemporal variability of indian monsoon rainfall was better predicted by imdaa dataset compared to other reanalysis precipitation product additionally the imdaa is a regional reanalysis dataset produced by met office uk and national centre for medium range weather forecasting ncmwrf india in collaboration with the india meteorological department the improved performance of wfdei dataset were also noted in previous study conducted by chen et al 2020 where they have mentioned that wfdei precipitation dataset depicts annual daily maximum rainfall over the globe better than persiann cdr dataset among all the spds the princeton precipitation dataset has shown very lower correlation with imd observed precipitation dataset the poor performance of princeton product was due to the derivation of the dataset form the ncep ncar national centre for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research as the previous literature javed et al 2021 had already investigated that the performance of ncep ncar precipitation dataset were not good over indian region the second part of the study investigated the benchmark scenario taking imd observed precipitation and user defined scenarios taking all the spds considering the two distinct hydrological models hysim and swat model considering the benchmark scenario the hysim and swat models performance have been evaluated based on streamflow simulation at the river basin outlet although both the models performed satisfactorily with nse greater than 0 7 during streamflow simulations in the benchmark scenario a slight improvement was observed in the hysim model nse 0 76 compared to the swat model the improved performance of the hysim model was possibly due to the simpler model structure and lesser number of model parameters while comparing against the swat model additionally the assumption of spatially homogeneous characteristics of the river basin and adoption of smaller number of conceptual elements facilitates the hysim model to perform better than swat during streamflow simulation the findings of the present study was also supported by dos santos et al 2018 while exploring the lumped model soil conservation service curve number performance against the semi distributed swat model reminiscent observations were also noticed in case of user defined hi ha hw si sa and sw scenarios hence the above analysis manifests the choice of input precipitation data with respect to the observed is an essential step before initiating any hydrological modelling exercise which addresses the first research question of this study during the computation of the bwf gwf and gws the swat model provides better insight compared to the hysim model by representing the spatial heterogeneity at sub basin levels however the hysim model fails to represent the spatial variation of the blue and green water due to its model structure deficiencies thus the findings of the study answer the second research question where the inherent capability of the swat model addresses research scope regarding the spatial heterogeneity of blue and green water over any typical river basin in the final section of the study investigated the potential of parameter transferability across input space and its effect on water accounting with six spds driven by two hydrological models with varying complexity subsequently analyzed the influence of the input data choice for spatiotemporal variability of the bwf gwf and gws in both the models limited studies have examined the scope of parameter transferability based experiment design across input space to see the influence of choice of inputs on the simulation results therefore the particular approach was explored herein by adopting the scenario based studies presented in section 3 5 which addressed the unexplored part by considering the spds as inputs for simulation in calibrated hydrological models the present study also supported by hoang et al 2018 where they have evaluated how input choices i e dem resolution and its complexity are influencing parameter uncertainty and output uncertainty in a swat hillslope swat hs model however in their study the recalibration partially compensates the effects of influence of different input choices and makes it hard to tell whether the observed output uncertainty is because of input choice or due to new sets of parameters our results suggested a considerable effect on bwf gwf and gws estimation for using parameter transferability approach across different precipitation input datasets and these output differences were clearly indicating the effect of input choices the influence of precipitation datasets was apparent in bwf estimation compared to gwf and gws for each scenario in our study location the reason behind the more sensitivity of bwf due to change in precipitation dataset is that bwf directly generates from precipitation but the generation of gwf and gws is not only dependent upon precipitation datasets but also other meteorological variables such as air temperature wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation a study conducted by yuan et al 2019 showed that gwf is less sensitive to precipitation compared to bwf they found that 10 increase in precipitation can result in 20 8 increase in bwf and 2 5 increase in gwf veettil and mishra 2016 also suggested in their study that bwf is more sensitive to precipitation and gwf is mainly influneced by water bodies like reservior and intense agriculture the following research findings were concluded from this study 1 the errors associated with the model inputs can directly affect the ranges and distributions of water components in a hydrological model but an experimental framework shown in this study considering the parameter transferability across the input space i e different choices of precipitation datasets with a fixed reference parameter set can help to facilitate the quantification of hydrological output uncertainty and differences in distribution of water components i e blue and green water the advantage of this approach is that the quantification of errors due to input model choices and its propagation can be accomplished without the trouble of compensating effect of recalibrated parameters 2 in comparison with reference imd dataset aphrodite precipitation product showed better performance in terms of higher correlation and lower error values compared to other precipitation datasets in the damodar river basin however different error propagation ratios indicated that all the six precipitations datasets are comparable when driven through swat and hysim models the γrrmse variations indicates that the random error propagated from all six precipitation datasets to streamflow simulation have dampened by both hysim and swat model and it has revealed the process representation strength of both the models 3 although the hysim and swat reference models were performing satisfactorily in the daily streamflow simulations the spatial heterogeneity in bwf gwf and gws was well represented by the swat simulation compared to the hysim the multimodel analysis based on imd data revealed that the portion of water components in the damodar river basin in terms of bwf gwf and gws are in the range of 558 656 mm year 574 728 mm year 30 112 mm year respectively the findings in this study will help hydrological modelers to have an exact quantification on how the choices of inputs affect water redistribution in the models and its error magnification especially when it is used for future climate change impact and adaptation studies the swat simulation results could be further strengthened with incorporation of controlled flow simulations from the upstream dams viz tilaiya dam konar dam maithon dam and panchet dam furthermore adding the anthropogenic effects considering the supply demand analysis on the basis of irrigation water requirements and domestic water use through reservoir simulation modules could be an interesting part for the future scope of the present work a comparative assessment between the hydrological models with reservoir modules including the aforementioned components could prominently highlight future work declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

3618,a robust quantitative assessment of water security through efficient water accounting concepts like blue and green water footprints has gained a lot of attention for water resources management at river basin scale however such water accounting tools and models have dependencies to the choice of precipitation data used to drive the model as the input bias propagate into simulated streamflow through interaction with different hydrological processes this study performs a holistic investigation of sensitivity of water accounting fractions like blue water flow bwf green water flow gwf green water storage gws and their dependencies on secondary precipitation datasets spds choices using a lumped conceptual rainfall runoff model hydrological simulation model hysim and a physically based semi distributed hydrological model soil and water assessment tool swat in the damodar river basin india these models were driven by seven gridded precipitation datasets including india meteorological department imd data indian monsoon data assimilation and analysis imdaa data asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation aphrodite data watch forcing era interim data climate hazard group infrared precipitation with station data chirps princeton precipitation data and precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural network climate data records persiann cdr data the reference imd based multimodel results revealed that the annual average blue and green water components of the damoder river were in the range of 558 656 mm year 574 728 mm year and 34 112 mm year for bwf gwf and gws respectively during 1994 2010 period the results obtained after applying parameter transferability approach across the input space have revealed exact quantification of choice dependent annual variations in spatial and temporal characteristics of bwf gwf and gws a further evaluation based on error propagation ratios γcc γrrmse γb has revealed a quantification of input choice induced dampening magnification effects on flow estimations of both the hysim and swat and these quantifications were free from the compensation effects of recalibration the findings in this study demonstrate that the change in annual average bwf varies between 46 97 to 41 38 in comparison to benchmark imd simulations and the corresponding changes for gwf is between 19 63 and 17 06 and for gws is between 29 97 to 35 5 with different choices of spd scenarios the systematic γb and random γrrmse error propagation factors during monsoon season are larger for swat model 0 21 0 78 0 69 0 89 respectively than that of hysim model 0 18 0 74 0 66 0 81 respectively and it is varying with choice of different spds keywords input dependency precipitation uncertainty parameter transferability error propagation damodar river india 1 introduction water management is an important human engineering intervention as water scarcity has grown as a worldwide problem making impacts on both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems efficient accounting of available water and use of rainwater is very important for effective water management in river basins looking into competition for water resources among agriculture livestock energy and other sectors though many conventional water resource assessment methods are available in water research an approach that conceptually divides freshwater into green water resources and blue water resources has gained a lot of attention after a work of falkenmark 1995 in which the terms green versus blue water use was first time introduced previous literature has highlighted that the estimation of blue water and green water plays an important role in freshwater availability and water security assessment studies for better water resources management falkenmark 2013 hoekstra 2014 in recent years researchers have studied the impact of climate variability and land use land cover changes on blue water and green water resources for assessment of water security at global scale as well as at river basin scale veettil and mishra 2018 veettil and mishra 2016 yuan et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b the commonly suited models for the estimation of runoff calculation and blue water green water resources assessments are soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 variable infiltration capacity vic hydrological simulation model hysim remesan et al 2019 a study by veettil and mishra 2018 investigated the impact of climate and anthropogenic variability on blue and green water scarcity in the savannah river basin using swat model some studies have focused on swat model for estimation of bwf and gwf in erhai lake basin yuan et al 2019 and ganjiang river basin zhang et al 2020b respectively the hysim is a relatively simple conceptual rainfall runoff model that has been extensively used for water accounting and runoff modeling in the europe harris et al 2013 and india remesan and holman 2015 whereas swat is a widely accepted physically based semi distributed model conceptual hydrological models based on the conceptualization of rainfall to runoff generation process which do not explicitly consider energy fluxes and thus mimic physical processes in a simplified manner liu et al 2017b conversely the physically based hydrological models based on scientific principle of water and energy fluxes describe the physical processes occurring within the catchment by solving differential equations for representation of mass momentum and energy conservation abbott et al 1986 although all the hydrological models are simplifications of complex real systems there are conflicting modelling philosophies in the hydrologic community about conceptual lumped models and physically based models sahoo and sahoo 2020 past studies feng et al 2019 were also claimed that a hydrological model could reproduce observed streamflow correctly by improper estimation of lateral flow evaporation deep percolation and shallow ground water flow occurring in a catchment chilkoti et al 2019 hence it will be an interesting research area to explore the computation of blue and green water dynamics in any typical river basin with solving the water balance components by incorporating structurally distinct two hydrological models lumped conceptual model hysim and semi distributed physically based model swat additionally the hydrological studies were also directly affected by the reduction in the number of in situ measurements sahoo et al 2020 to a greater extent among those precipitation is one of the most important components of hydrological modelling as its spatiotemporal variability significantly affects water resources availability and hydrological behaviour in any typical river basin pang et al 2020 panda et al 2021 of course the measurement of the precipitation by rain gauge was significantly affected due to i high cost and time involvements darand et al 2017 ii data accessibility issues in remote locations and iii theft of sensors although the precipitation measurement could also be done by weather radar and satellite observations liu et al 2017a zhang et al 2020a weather radar observations can only provide spatial coverage of 300 km from radar sites moreover these precipitation products are typically subject to number of constraints including beam height variation and massive power consumption zhang et al 2020a to alleviate all these aforementioned limitations related to rain gauge and weather radar measurement alazzy et al 2017 recently the remotely sensed satellite observations and reanalysis precipitation datasets jointly termed as secondary precipitation datasets spds have been gaining its popularity for wide application in hydrological modeling studies there are several spds available at finer spatial 0 05 to 0 5 and temporal 3 hourly or daily resolutions over global or quasi global scale among the freely accessible spds the commonly used datasets are indian monsoon data assimilation and analysis imdaa rani et al 2021 asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation aphrodite yatagai et al 2012 watch forcing data era interim wfdei weedon et al 2014 v climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps funk et al 2015 vi princeton sheffield et al 2006 vii precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural network persiann cdr ashouri et al 2015 the accuracy of these spds are highly dependent on regional topography climate and precipitation type darand et al 2017 due to measurement errors arising from sampling techniques and errors in spds musie et al 2019 therefore the performance and accuracy of spds should be properly assessed with reference to regional and basin scale instead of global scale for improvement in satellite retrieval algorithm alazzy et al 2017 and also for identification of suitable dataset which can be used for hydrological modelling studies subsequently helps in water resources decision making studies musie et al 2019 several research have been carried out to evaluate the accuracy of spds by comparing them with rain gauge based precipitation datasets using statistical measures and also to investigate the performance of different spds in streamflow simulation using hydrological models liu et al 2017a pang et al 2020 venkatesh et al 2020 for instance wong et al 2017 performed an inter comparison between gridded precipitation datasets princeton wfdei and narr against rain gauge observation data and calculated the error distribution of gridded precipitation datasets over different terrestrial zones in canada similarly the comprehensive performance of 36 spds available over iran were also investigated by saemian et al 2021 with reference to streamflow simulation using swat model 16 spds were also evaluated at the tungabhadra river basin of india by venkatesh et al 2020 even though earlier studies explored the significance of the available spds for streamflow simulation using various hydrological models the reliability of these spds for blue and green water computation are still unexplored of course streamflow is a vital component in the hydrological cycle it is also important to study the uncertainty of other water balance components evapotranspiration and soil moisture due to changes in precipitation datasets for basin scale water availability assessment following all these inherent research queries this study aims to provide an insight of the interconnection between green and blue water dynamics through two widely accepted hydrological modeling schemes hysim and swat and their dependency on the choice of precipitation input space in most of the previous literatures india meteorological department imd dataset has been considered as a standard benchmarking data for evaluation of spds in india and widely applied for inter comparison of globally available spds gupta et al 2020 a monte carlo assessment based approach has been proposed by hong et al 2006 to investigate precipitation error propagation into hydrological simulations ensemble streamflow error statistics based approach was used to study error propagation in the tocantins araguaia basin in brazil falck et al 2015 ratios of precipitation to streamflow simulation error metrics are another way to represent precipitation error propagation as presented by mei et al 2016 the focus area of this study is the damodar valley in upstream of durgapur barrage located in west bengal and jharkhand provinces of india proper quantification of upstream water availability is essential in the durgapur barrage region as it is a major infrastructure constructed as part of damodar valley project dvp with broader aims like monsoon months flood control dry winter irrigation hydroelectricity generation ghosh 2011 many studies have highlighted that the recognition of how the modeller s subjective choice of meteorological data makes an influence on baseline and future uncertainty of hydrological simulations is vital for all water accounting studies momblanch et al 2019 remesan and holman 2015 liersch et al 2020 although several number of freely available spds accessible nowadays limited studies investigated decencies of these precipitation products on green water blue water redistribution at the river basin scale additionally it can yield interesting research knowledge on hydrological models i e lumped and distributed model behaviour if we combine parameter transferability concept to quantify the influence of input choices on streamflow blue and green water computation even in sparsely gauged river basins as here we have chosen damodar river basin these model behaviors can be translated error propagation indexes to get a wider understanding of the uncertainties in multimodel simulations due to modeller choice on precipitation data products considering these above mentioned scope of study this work has addressed the following research questions i how close is the choice of global regional gridded secondary precipitation datasets spds i e imdaa aphrodite wfdei chirps princeton persiann cdr considering the imd precipitation dataset as the benchmark data for india ii how efficiently and effectively the hydrological models viz hysim and swat can simulate green and blue water dynamics using the selected precipitation datasets in the damodar river basin while calibrating hydrological models with benchmark imd precipitation dataset iii how does the precipitation error propagate through the hydrologic model simulation to green and blue water quantification considering parameter transferability approach iv how the modeler s subjectivity on choice of precipitation data products influences the spatiotemporal details of bwf gwf and gws by hysim and swat 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area this present study was carried out in the damodar river basin situated in eastern india the damodar river basin a part of the ganges river system lies between 84 30 to 88 15 east longitude and 22 15 to 24 30 north longitude the length of the damodar river is 592 km and the drainage area of the basin is 23 380 km2 it originates from khamarpat hill at the trijunction of palamu ranchi and hazaribag district of jharkhand the river basin extends over hazaribag ramgarh koderma giridh dhanbad bokaro and chatra districts in jharkhand burdwan and hooghly districts in west bengal and joins the river hooghly at 50 km below kolkata the upper part of the damodar river basin extends over the state of jharkhand and the lower fan deltaic basin spreads over the state of west bengal singh et al 2020 for controlling the monsoon flood in lower catchment damodar valley corporation dvc constructed four dams and 1 barrage viz tilaya dam on barakar river 1953 konar dam on konar river 1955 maithon on barakar river 1955 panchet 1959 and durgapur barrage 1955 on the damodar river ghosh and guchhait 2016 durgapur barrage is the last hydraulic structure in the river reach which supply irrigation water to burdwan bankura and hoogly district and also control river flow to the downstream side of damodar river basin singh et al 2020 two main canals right bank canal 88 5 km length and left bank canal 136 8 km length originate from durgapur barrage form a large network of main and branch canals with an accumulated length of 2494 km supply water for domestic and industrial purpose in the different stretches of the river the whole durgapur township with approximately 5 22 lakh population is dependent on this barrage for water supply so management of water resources in this location is very important in the context of increasing demand of water for agricultural domestic and industrial needs the location map of the damodar river basin up to durgapur barrage is shown in fig 1 the annual rainfall of this basin ranges from 1000 mm to 1850 mm verma et al 2017 and temperature ranges from 40 c to 42 c in summer season and 23 c to 26 c in winter season 2 2 meteorological data the hysim model use sub basin average precipitation and potential evapotranspiration as input data in this study sub basin average precipitation and potential evapotranspiration have been calculated using the thiessen polygon method whereas the daily potential evapotranspiration has been calculated using the hargreaves method the input meteorological data required by swat are precipitation maximum temperature minimum temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed maximum and minimum daily temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed data were obtained from climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr at a resolution of 0 312 x0 312 in this study seven precipitation datasets from 1994 to 2010 were adopted for the hysim and swat model simulation these datasets were i imd observed gridded

the six precipitation datasets were statistically evaluated against imd observed data considering the following statistical metrices correlation co efficient cc mean error me root mean square error rmse and percentage bias pbias as enlisted in table 2 3 2 hysim setup the hysim is a continuous conceptual lumped rainfall runoff model that simulates hydrological cycle surface runoff percolation to

which describes river basin and channel characteristics the hydrological parameters are represented by seven natural storages snow interception upper soil horizon lower soil horizon transitional groundwater groundwater and minor channels while the hydraulic parameters use kinematic routing of river flows murphy and charlton 2006 the river basin can be partitioned into number of sub basins which can be further sub divided into at most three hydrological zones consisting of homogenous soil type and meteorology in this study the damodar river basin has been sub divided into three hydrological zones depending upon the position of the streamflow data available 3 3 swat setup swat is a semi distributed physically based hydrologic river basin scale continuous model operates at daily and sub daily time step it predicts climate change and land use change impact on hydrological processes sediment yield and agricultural chemical yield in large complex river basins eckhardt et al 2005 the model divides any given basin into many sub basins and each sub basin is further divided into hydrological response units hrus which is an identical combination of land use soil type and surface slope the hydrological cycle simulation in swat is based on water balance equation as shown in eq 1 1 s w t s w 0 i 1 t r day q surf e a w seep q gw i where s w t mm is the final soil water content s w 0 mm is the initial soil water content on day i t days is time r day mm is the precipitation amount on day i q surf mm is the amount of surface runoff on day i e a mm is the evapotranspiration et amount on day i w seep is the amount of water entering the vadose zone from the soil profile on day i and q gw mm is the amount of groundwater flow on day i for computing flow routing through the channel muskingum method was selected and the penman monteith equation was adopted for the estimation of potential evapotranspiration the modified soil conservation service runoff curve number scs cn has been chosen for estimating surface runoff volume in this study damodar river basins have been divided into 31 subbasins including 448 hrus though there may be loss of information about the river basin landscape a non zero hru threshold approach was applied that consist of land cover 5 soil 10 and slope 10 in defining hrus to improve the computational efficiency and these values been chosen within the range of 5 to 15 srinivasan et al 2010 these values were chosen because these are the commonly used threshold ranges which carries minor information losses in water yield and streamflow simulations by the swat model her et al 2015 as proper reservoir representation is absent in the hysim model remesan and holman 2015 the comparison of the hysim and swat models have been done by considering naturalized flow conditions for the simulation of streamflow along with bwf gwf and gws 3 4 model calibration validation and evaluation both the hysim and swat were calibrated for 12 years 1991 2004 at a daily step against the observed streamflow at the catchment outlet durgapur barrage first three years 1991 1993 were used for model warm up period for both models after calibration these two models were validated for six years 2005 2010 the reduced error of estimate technique has been implemented for calibration of five parameters remesan et al 2019 remesan and holman 2015 in hysim although there are two additional snow related hydrological parameters snow temperature threshold snowmelt rate for each degree of temperature above the threshold this study considered five calibrating parameters with reference to the geographical location of the river basin tropical climatic zone the whole river basin is not experienced any snow events throughout the year during our study period 1991 2010 the calibrated parameters and their values for hysim are shown in table 3 sequential uncertainty fitting ver 2 sufi 2 a semi automated algorithm in swat cup swat calibration and uncertainty produces daggupati et al 2015 was used in this study for calibration of swat to quantify the parameter uncertainty of the streamflow modeling the prescribed range of swat calibrated parameters are listed in table 4 the performance of these two models for streamflow simulation were evaluated using three statistical indices nash sutcliffe efficiency nse co efficient of determination r2 and percent bias pbias as presented in table 2 3 5 parameter transferability across inputs experiment scenario design transferability is the ability of a hydrological model calibrated for one time location or input space to produce realistic results at another time location and or meteorological forcing input space it is a general consideration that calibrated parameters cannot be transferred without recalibration to a different model setting with new data source changes in temporal or spatial nature of data cullmann et al 2006 in most climate change scenario hydrological studies there is an implicit assumption that the parameters are calibrated based on baseline observations remain valid for future climatic conditions too a study by remesan et al 2015 argues that the recalibration process will effectively modify hydrological parameters and it compensates all uncertainties in input data and hide how the input choice made by the modeler influenced the modeling results thus here to study the effect of different precipitation sources on the swat and hysim model outputs and how it influences the redistribution of water between various runoff components green and blue we have built different scenarios after transferring parameters calibrated at imd observed precipitation across new model input settings i e replacing imd observed precipitation data with imdaa aphrodite wfdei chirps princeton persiann cdr other data inputs were kept same without recalibration the scenario based simulation has been adopted for both hysim and swat model simulations to know precipitation source dependencies on streamflow simulation bwf gwf and gws 12 parameter transferability scenarios presented in table 5 were considered using imdaa aphrodite wfdei chirps princeton persiann cdr precipitation datasets after parameter transfer from calibrated and validated reference hysim and swat model based on imd observed precipitation data set 3 6 estimation of error translation from precipitation to simulated streamflow for this purpose we have introduced an error propagation ratio metric as suggested by mei et al 2016 2 γ em r em p in eq 2 emp and emr are the estimated error metrics i e based on cc γcc based on rrmse γrrmse and based on absolute value of bias γb for precipitation sets and runoff simulations respectively the equations used to calculate cc rrmse and absolute value of bias are also shown in table 2 though these metrics have deficiencies like i focus is only on absolute error values ii ignoring systematic error and iii focus are only on precipitation and runoff etc it can tell whether precipitation error effect is dampening or amplifying when it is transforming from rainfall to runoff this scenario based error propagation assessment is free from the magnitude effect of parameters we have used the same parameter values calibrated based on reference imd observed data as described in section 3 5 as majority of rainfall events occurred during monsoon season at tropical river basin this analysis was performed with specific focus on monsoon season in streamflow magnitude 3 7 estimation of blue and green water in this study bwf was calculated as the summation of model simulated surface runoff subsurface runoff and groundwater recharge mao et al 2020 green water can be classified into two components gwf and gws gwf is the actual evapotranspiration which is defined as the loss of water distributed to the atmosphere by evaporation from water and soil and transpiration from vegetation cover aghakhani afshar et al 2018 whereas gws is the water content in the soil profile which is available for crop growth veettil and mishra 2018 after integrating all the hydrological components using two distinct hydrological models the blue and green water computation were carried out in this study 4 results 4 1 comparison of secondary precipitation products with imd data as the imd observed gridded precipitation dataset has used more land based observations the present study has considered imd data as a benchmark dataset for inter comparison of spds and for building the reference hydrological models fig 3 represents the spatial variation of average annual precipitation for six spds along with imd observed precipitation data when comparing the average annual precipitation occurred over the damodar river basin fig 3 these spds exhibited similar patterns that revealed an increasing trend of precipitation magnitude from northwest to southeast direction the annual average precipitation for imdaa dataset was larger than imd observed precipitation data as well as other five spds concurrently the intra annual variation of six spds along with imd observation were also analysed using the boxplot as illustrated in fig 4 as the study area receives 70 75 of its rainfall during southeast monsoon period the study mainly amplifies the analysis during monsoon season as magnified in fig 4 although all the six spds were correctly anticipated the timing of monsoon the consistency of these products were varied remarkably with the imd observed data the imdaa aphrodite and wfdei have more consistency with imd observed gridded dataset compared to chrips princeton and persiann cdr datasets the chirps princeton and persiann cdr datasets always underestimated precipitation amount in the monsoon season by about 941 55 mm 863 27 mm and 1323 23 mm on average respectively to reveal the uncertainty and variability of precipitation data products the variation of six spds against imd observed dataset in monsoon season were demonstrated using q q plots and scatter plots fig 5 four statistical indices me cc rmse and pbias were also calculated to quantify the error in spds compared to imd precipitation dataset as illustrated in fig 5 the observations using the q q plot fig 5 was also symmetrical with the previous analysis which signifies three spds aphrodite wfdei imdaa were showing better correlation compared to the rest spds chirps persiann cdr princeton the aphrodite dataset matches the best when compared with imd observed dataset with cc 0 8 and rmse 6 73 followed by wfdei cc 0 53 and rmse 9 75 and imdaa cc 0 48 and rmse 10 67 compared to other three spds chirps persiann cdr princeton all the aforementioned analysis revealed that the princeton product had the least performance over the damodar river basin with cc 0 09 and rmse 16 4 thus it can be inferred that a significant difference was noticed between the six spds when compared with the imd observed dataset using statistical metrices therefore when a modeler decides to choose any of these precipitation products for hydrological applications the errors associated with these products will propagate to the simulated hydrological outcomes subsequently the present study also investigated those error propagation while using the spds for hydrological model simulation as elaborated in the subsequent sections 4 2 reference imd data based hysim and swat simulations and spatial analysis of bwf gwf and gws following the proposed framework for scenario simulation as described in section 3 5 the study initiated its reference simulation using benchmark imd observed datasets for calibration and validation the observed streamflow has been compared with simulated streamflow data from each of the two models at the catchment outlet location durgapur barrage hence the proposed plan was executed using imd observed precipitation data and the time series plot of observed and simulated flow for two models were shown in fig 6 which indicates that the temporal pattern of streamflow hydrograph was well evaluated by the hysim and swat in both calibration and validation period subsequently the performance of the models was evaluated using nse and r2 which signifies the satisfactory performance of the models with the observed streamflow the pbias values represent that both models overestimated observed streamflow in calibration period and can be rated as satisfactory as it is in the range of 12 the overall analysis of result based on all three statistical indicators showed that during streamflow simulation the hysim outperformed swat model in both calibration and validation period after simulating the streamflow other hydrological components were also analysed which were again utilized for blue and green water simulation subsequently the spatial variability of mean annual bwf gwf and gws with respect to imd observed precipitation dataset were computed and presented in fig 7 for the hysim and swat models the annual average bwf was ranging from 317 65 mm to 605 54 mm and 502 85 mm to 835 65 mm for the hysim and swat model respectively the spatial variability of bwf gwf and gws revealed that the swat model was more efficiently representing the spatial heterogeneity of blue and green water resources at subbasin scale compared to the hysim model as swat splits the whole river basin into 31 subbasins whereas the hysim model divides the same into atmost three sub basins 4 3 scenario simulations and streamflow inter comparisons with reference imd hysim and swat models with reference to the intercomparison between the parameter transferability scenarios table 5 the six spds were again used as precipitation inputs for previously imd calibrated hysim and swat models the calibration 1991 2004 and validation period 2005 2010 of these scenarios were also remained consistent with the reference scenario the nse and r2 values table 6 in hi ha hw si sa and sw scenarios indicate that the performance of both models were better in case of imdaa aphrodite and wfdei precipitation product compared to chirps princeton and persiann cdr precipitation product during both calibration and validation period analysing the statistical metrices and model performances in desired scenarios the adopted parameter transferability approaches are working efficiently in this context the transferability of model parameters from the imd precipitation based input space to that of imdaa aphrodite and wfdei based input space was relatively stable compared to that of chirps princeton and persiann cdr data products the least performance scenarios hc hp hpr sc sp and spr were also noticed having high biases and low nse for both calibration and validation period precisely these hydrological comparative metric values indicating how the consequence of the fixed parameterization imd based with choices of different spds manifest significantly on hydrological model behavior and performance during the historical baseline period to test the model prediction reliability the quantile quantile plot of model simulated discharge for both models driven by six spds were illustrated in fig 8 it was clear from of fig 8 that huge uncertainty exists from different choices of precipitation inputs to the hysim and swat model simulation outputs to investigate the reproducibility of the streamflow from the pecribed scenarios flow duration curve fdc analysis was also carried out herein fig 9 of course this fdc analysis help to represent the runoff variability irrespective of the occurrence of the events reproduced by the user defined scenario simulations sahoo et al 2020 4 4 how parameter transferability across input space with different meteorological forcing affects bwf gwf and gws to see the influence of the precipitation choice on redistribution of water within the model with respect to that fixed imd parameterization the month wise details of percent bias comparison between simulated average monthly streamflow for hysim and swat model along with green water blue water distributions were envisaged in fig 10 more statistical details were provided in the supplementary material these figures revealed the changes in the redistribution of water at damodar river basin with input choices precipitation in parameter transferability approach which usually be hidden or compensated with recalibrated parameters the changes in spatial distribution of bwf gwf and gws with respect to the reference imd hysim and swat model were shown in figs 11 and 12 as aphrodite imdaa and wfdei datasets were showing better performance than other precipitation datasets in the case of precipitation evaluation and streamflow simulation only these three spds were considered for spatial heterogeneity representation of bwf gwf and gws simulations hence the spatial distribution of bwf gwf and gws for hi ha hw si sa sw scenarios were represented in figs 11 and 12 as shown in figs 11 and 12 parameter transferability also has a significant impact on bwf and gwf distribution for both hysim and swat models the si and sw scenario results in overestimation of bwf distribution in the middle and lower part of the river basin whereas the sa scenario showed underestimation in bwf throughout the river basin the percentage change in gwf for all six scenarios ha hi hw sa si and sw signifies that the spatial heterogeneity in gwf distribution was relatively small compared to bwf distribution the overestimation in gwf was observed in the case of si 2 74 22 75 and sw 5 42 26 41 scenarios on the other hand a mixed signal was noticed in case of sa scenario 6 62 10 64 where both increase and decrease in gwf was observed for the entire river basin the sa si and sw scenario depicted gws distribution similar to the reference swat model with smaller percentage change varies from 6 69 2 32 0 44 10 24 and 4 53 10 83 respectively indicating model parameter transferability across new input space does not significantly impact gws distribution hence the sensitivity of bwf and gwf to precipitation datasets for both the hysim and swat model were performed as illistrated in fig 13 interestingly the scenario based simulations followed by corresponding scenario based bwf and gwf computation analysis suggested that precipitation variability directly influence the blue and green water distribution throughout the basin hence the sensitivity results signify that bwf was more sensitive to precipitation datasets compared to gwf the correlation coefficients were always higher than 0 64 for bwf fig 13 conversely the lower correlation coefficient in case of swat model and negative coorelation for hysim model between gwf and precipitation datasets implied that precipitation datasets had less control over gwf 4 5 quantification of precipitation error propagation to runoff simulations different indices i e based on cc γcc based on rrmse γrrmse and based on absolute value of bias γb were used for rendering the error propagation from different precipitation to runoff the rainfall runoff error transformation in monsoon season for twelve scenarios are explained in the fig 14 it was indicating the details of dampening and magnification of the error propagation for twelve scenarios hi ha hw hc hp hpr si sa sw sc sp spr the value of γcc was greater than 1 highlighting to improvement from precipitation to streamflow lower interquartile range of γcc has been observed in the case of hi ha hw si sa and sw scenarios compared to other scenarios the error propagation in terms of γrrmse for all four scenarios was shown in fig 14 b the values of γrrmse were below 1 which indicated dampening effect on random error of rainfall to streamflow values for all twelve scenarios demonstrating the rigour of both hydrological model s structure to translate precipiation to streamflow the propagation ratio based on absolute bias value γb for ha hpr sc and spr scenario were below 1 indicating dampening effect of systematic error when translating the precipitation into runoff however the value of γb for other scenarios ranged from 0 to 1 75 implying that there was no adequate information of the direction to either damening or amplifying the systematic error of precipitation to runoff 5 discussion and conclusions this study compared and statistically evaluated the performance of six high resolution gridded spds against reference imd data and analyzed the impact of spds on bwf gwf and gws in the damodar river basin india in the aforementioned results the statistical evaluation of six spds revealed that the aphrodite precipitation dataset was highly correlated to imd observed gridded precipitation product compared to other spds similar findings were also noticed in previous literature for better capability of aphrodite dataset in capturing daily precipitation in india bhattacharyya and sreekesh 2021 prakash et al 2015 rana et al 2015 the possible reason behind the high correlation of aphrodite datasets with imd observed gridded data was due to availability of dense network of rain gauge data over asia source climatedataguide ucar edu among the spds imdaa and wfdei products showed better performance than chirps princeton and persiann cdr datasets ashrit et al 2020 mentioned in their study that the spatiotemporal variability of indian monsoon rainfall was better predicted by imdaa dataset compared to other reanalysis precipitation product additionally the imdaa is a regional reanalysis dataset produced by met office uk and national centre for medium range weather forecasting ncmwrf india in collaboration with the india meteorological department the improved performance of wfdei dataset were also noted in previous study conducted by chen et al 2020 where they have mentioned that wfdei precipitation dataset depicts annual daily maximum rainfall over the globe better than persiann cdr dataset among all the spds the princeton precipitation dataset has shown very lower correlation with imd observed precipitation dataset the poor performance of princeton product was due to the derivation of the dataset form the ncep ncar national centre for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research as the previous literature javed et al 2021 had already investigated that the performance of ncep ncar precipitation dataset were not good over indian region the second part of the study investigated the benchmark scenario taking imd observed precipitation and user defined scenarios taking all the spds considering the two distinct hydrological models hysim and swat model considering the benchmark scenario the hysim and swat models performance have been evaluated based on streamflow simulation at the river basin outlet although both the models performed satisfactorily with nse greater than 0 7 during streamflow simulations in the benchmark scenario a slight improvement was observed in the hysim model nse 0 76 compared to the swat model the improved performance of the hysim model was possibly due to the simpler model structure and lesser number of model parameters while comparing against the swat model additionally the assumption of spatially homogeneous characteristics of the river basin and adoption of smaller number of conceptual elements facilitates the hysim model to perform better than swat during streamflow simulation the findings of the present study was also supported by dos santos et al 2018 while exploring the lumped model soil conservation service curve number performance against the semi distributed swat model reminiscent observations were also noticed in case of user defined hi ha hw si sa and sw scenarios hence the above analysis manifests the choice of input precipitation data with respect to the observed is an essential step before initiating any hydrological modelling exercise which addresses the first research question of this study during the computation of the bwf gwf and gws the swat model provides better insight compared to the hysim model by representing the spatial heterogeneity at sub basin levels however the hysim model fails to represent the spatial variation of the blue and green water due to its model structure deficiencies thus the findings of the study answer the second research question where the inherent capability of the swat model addresses research scope regarding the spatial heterogeneity of blue and green water over any typical river basin in the final section of the study investigated the potential of parameter transferability across input space and its effect on water accounting with six spds driven by two hydrological models with varying complexity subsequently analyzed the influence of the input data choice for spatiotemporal variability of the bwf gwf and gws in both the models limited studies have examined the scope of parameter transferability based experiment design across input space to see the influence of choice of inputs on the simulation results therefore the particular approach was explored herein by adopting the scenario based studies presented in section 3 5 which addressed the unexplored part by considering the spds as inputs for simulation in calibrated hydrological models the present study also supported by hoang et al 2018 where they have evaluated how input choices i e dem resolution and its complexity are influencing parameter uncertainty and output uncertainty in a swat hillslope swat hs model however in their study the recalibration partially compensates the effects of influence of different input choices and makes it hard to tell whether the observed output uncertainty is because of input choice or due to new sets of parameters our results suggested a considerable effect on bwf gwf and gws estimation for using parameter transferability approach across different precipitation input datasets and these output differences were clearly indicating the effect of input choices the influence of precipitation datasets was apparent in bwf estimation compared to gwf and gws for each scenario in our study location the reason behind the more sensitivity of bwf due to change in precipitation dataset is that bwf directly generates from precipitation but the generation of gwf and gws is not only dependent upon precipitation datasets but also other meteorological variables such as air temperature wind speed relative humidity and solar radiation a study conducted by yuan et al 2019 showed that gwf is less sensitive to precipitation compared to bwf they found that 10 increase in precipitation can result in 20 8 increase in bwf and 2 5 increase in gwf veettil and mishra 2016 also suggested in their study that bwf is more sensitive to precipitation and gwf is mainly influneced by water bodies like reservior and intense agriculture the following research findings were concluded from this study 1 the errors associated with the model inputs can directly affect the ranges and distributions of water components in a hydrological model but an experimental framework shown in this study considering the parameter transferability across the input space i e different choices of precipitation datasets with a fixed reference parameter set can help to facilitate the quantification of hydrological output uncertainty and differences in distribution of water components i e blue and green water the advantage of this approach is that the quantification of errors due to input model choices and its propagation can be accomplished without the trouble of compensating effect of recalibrated parameters 2 in comparison with reference imd dataset aphrodite precipitation product showed better performance in terms of higher correlation and lower error values compared to other precipitation datasets in the damodar river basin however different error propagation ratios indicated that all the six precipitations datasets are comparable when driven through swat and hysim models the γrrmse variations indicates that the random error propagated from all six precipitation datasets to streamflow simulation have dampened by both hysim and swat model and it has revealed the process representation strength of both the models 3 although the hysim and swat reference models were performing satisfactorily in the daily streamflow simulations the spatial heterogeneity in bwf gwf and gws was well represented by the swat simulation compared to the hysim the multimodel analysis based on imd data revealed that the portion of water components in the damodar river basin in terms of bwf gwf and gws are in the range of 558 656 mm year 574 728 mm year 30 112 mm year respectively the findings in this study will help hydrological modelers to have an exact quantification on how the choices of inputs affect water redistribution in the models and its error magnification especially when it is used for future climate change impact and adaptation studies the swat simulation results could be further strengthened with incorporation of controlled flow simulations from the upstream dams viz tilaiya dam konar dam maithon dam and panchet dam furthermore adding the anthropogenic effects considering the supply demand analysis on the basis of irrigation water requirements and domestic water use through reservoir simulation modules could be an interesting part for the future scope of the present work a comparative assessment between the hydrological models with reservoir modules including the aforementioned components could prominently highlight future work declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

3619,the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes of water δ 2h and δ 18o are powerful tracers for studying subsurface water flow processes but the extraction of porewater from unsaturated soil is complex and laborious the direct liquid vapor equilibration method dlve for isotope analysis overcomes this challenge by analyzing headspace vapor in isotopic equilibrium with the porewater under closed system conditions however the effect of the equilibration time soil texture and porewater saturation on isotopic results is not fully understood yet we tested three differently textured disaggregated soils sandy silty loam and clay to assess how the equilibration time is impacted by i porewater saturation 100 80 60 and 40 and ii soil surface area for all tests the water loss through diffusion was negligible 0 3 the experiments showed that for disaggregated sandy soil 24 h was a sufficient isotopic equilibration time regardless of water saturation level similarly 24 h was sufficient for kaolinite samples with 100 saturation exhibiting little isotopic variance even after 168 h of equilibration for saturated silty loam with 2 organic carbon content 96 h was the optimal equilibration time whereas saturated silty loam with 4 organic carbon content did not reach isotopic equilibrium by 168 h the optimal equilibration time increased depending on whether soil samples were disaggregated or kept in a core cutter inconclusive results for silty soils with organic carbon revealed the need to further investigate the possible influence of organic carbon on the dlve method keywords direct liquid vapor equilibration method dlve water stable isotopes sample preparation cavity ring down spectroscopy crds 1 introduction the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes of water δ 2h and δ 18o are used to trace water in the hydrological cycle in the absence of piezometers or lysimeters porewater cannot be sampled directly and needs to be extracted from soil sediment or geologic samples typically using laboratory based water extraction techniques such as high speed centrifugation azeotropic distillation allison and hughes 1983 cryogenic micro distillation araguas araguas et al 1995 microwave distillation munksgaard et al 2014 mechanical squeezing white et al 1985 cryogenic vacuum extraction koeniger et al 2011 and the accelerated solvent extraction technique zhu et al 2014 however a review by kelln et al 2001 showed large differences in porewater isotopic composition obtained from clay rich soils using centrifugation mechanical squeezing and azeotropic distillation methods inter laboratory comparisons further revealed large discrepancies between measured δ 18o and δ 2h values using different liquid water extraction methods orlowski et al 2018 beyer et al 2020 hence different porewater extraction methods lead to incomparable isotopic compositions which emphasizes the need for sound and adoptable measurement protocols as an alternative to liquid water extraction methods porewater can be proxy analyzed in the laboratory by using the direct liquid vapor equilibration dlve method and laser based spectrometry wassenaar et al 2008 apart from laboratory analysis in situ equilibration of porewater was also developed using gas permeable tubes or soil gas probes for soils rothfuss et al 2013 gaj et al 2016 or using porous probes for analyzing isotopes in tree xylem water volkmann et al 2016 the dlve method is based on the equilibration between soil porewater and water vapor contained in the headspace of a closed sealable bag wassenaar et al 2008 briefly liquid water used as standards or soil samples are equilibrated at constant temperature in re sealable collapsible plastic ziploc bags filled with dry air after 24 72 h the fully equilibrated 100 relative humidity vapor headspace is analyzed as an isotopic proxy for the liquid porewater using cavity ring down spectroscopy crds or off axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy oa icos the isotopic equilibration time in the ziploc bags is affected by the soil texture soil volume soil chemistry soil saturation level and soil sampling method wassenaar et al 2008 gaj et al 2018 gaj and mcdonnell 2019 wang et al 2019 hendry et al 2013 the soil matric potential was found to influence the isotopic equilibrium fractionation factor of differently textured soil samples stored for only 24 h before analysis gaj et al 2018 gaj and mcdonnell 2019 while liquid water needs 10 min to reach full water vapor isotopic equilibrium in ziploc bags at 22 c wassenaar et al 2008 the equilibration time for soil samples is longer and depends on soil texture for example clayey soils with low hydraulic conductivity take considerably longer to reach porewater vapor isotopic equilibrium compared to sandy soil of higher hydraulic conductivity wassenaar et al 2008 previous studies used equilibration times ranging from hours to several days and no standardized protocol for different soil or sediment samples exists yet garvelmann et al 2012 equilibrated soil samples for 15 h for sandy and sandy loam texture müller et al 2014 equilibrated samples for 15 h in laminated polyester bags using different soil texture from two steep hillslopes in the central alps switzerland different soil texture fluvial gravel coarse sand silt silty loam loam and clayey loam from three study sites in temperate central europe were equilibrated for 48 h by sprenger et al 2015 hendry et al 2013 obtained an accurate porewater isotopic composition of fine textured soil samples by equilibrating cretaceous sediments for seven days additionally wang et al 2019 found that 12 24 h were sufficient to reach an equilibrium in ziploc bags for soils with different clay and water content initially wassenaar et al 2008 suggested that sand with 5 gravimetric water content and consolidated shale were unsuitable for the dlve method as evaporative isotopic enrichment in δ 18o and δ 2h in the headspace vapor of ziploc bags was observed during longer equilibration time additionally wang et al 2019 observed isotopic enrichment of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes for dry soil samples with different clay contents to restrict isotopic enrichment induced by the diffusion of water vapor out of the bag hendry et al 2015 suggested increasing the sample size to buffer evaporation enrichment in the remaining porewater wang et al 2019 and orlowski et al 2016 showed that clay and water content must also be considered for the conversion and calibration of the water vapor isotopic composition into the porewater isotopic composition contrary to previous findings gaj et al 2016 obtained porewater isotope measurements with good precision δ18o 0 8 δ 2h 2 5 for medium sand soils with 1 vol soil water content in a semi arid region in namibia using water vapor equilibration techniques with two different laser spectrometers oa icos and crds these studies altogether indicate that the potential and concomitant influences of different soil textures and saturation levels on isotopic enrichment in equilibration bags needs to be further explored this should be done to gain a better understanding of how to reliably measure soil samples using the dlve method the use of resealable inflatable plastic bags also revealed technical problems from minor water vapor loss out of the bags through diffusive transport and back diffusion of vapor from laboratory air into the bags wassenaar et al 2008 hendry et al 2015 low cost plastic freezer bags with double zipper seals were initially used but were vulnerable to leakage and evaporative loss wassenaar et al 2008 double bagging greatly improved this and later investigation by hendry et al 2015 showed water loss from ziploc bags crystal clear bags and isopak were larger than from mylar black bags and silver pouches the latter albeit more costly are preferable for up to 50 days of sample storage and avoiding water loss additionally mattei et al 2019 found that large re usable fold a carrier reliance plastic carboys allowed 30 days of sample storage albeit at a higher cost of 10 usd bag however it was observed that resealable bags which were too airtight did not allow spectrally interfering biogenic gases to escape biogenic gas buildup is produced in situ during long equilibration times and negatively interferes with the laser isotope spectral analyses gralher et al 2018 hendry et al 2011 interferences from biogenic carbon dioxide co2 can be corrected by using sensitivity spectral features recorded with the crds analyzers gralher et al 2018 thus it appears that low cost ziploc plastic freezer bags are sufficiently airtight to allow for water isotope analysis performed within 10 days before evaporative loss becomes apparent while at the same time minimizing biogenic gas buildup hendry et al 2015 in most studies the dlve method is operationally carried out using different i sample storage bags ii soil sample sizes iii treatment procedures and iv equilibration times hendry et al 2015 orlowski et al 2016 gralher et al 2018 gaj et al 2018 gaj and mcdonnell 2019 gralher et al 2021 however it remains unclear how different saturation levels and equilibration times affect the isotopic analyses of porewater in soils having different physicochemical characteristics thus to investigate the effect of varying soil textures and saturation levels on the porewater vapor equilibration process in a closed system a series of laboratory experiments were conducted different soil samples sandy silty loam and clay with varied saturation levels 100 80 60 and 40 were equilibrated for different times under isothermal conditions this study aims at improving our understanding on the application and possible limitations of the dlve method to analyze the stable isotopic composition of soil porewater 2 methods 2 1 soil material four different soil samples with different chemical and physical properties were studied table 1 sandy soil free of organic carbon was obtained from a gravel pit in bruckmühl near munich germany based on laboratory dry sieving the sample consisted of 10 fine sand 31 medium sand 28 coarse sand and 30 fine gravel clay and silt accounted for ca 1 the silty loam samples were topsoil from two different field sites in lower austria one being mistelbach and the other obersiebenbrunn based on wet sieving and sedimentation the soil from mistelbach consisted of 11 sand 64 silt and 25 clay while soil from obersiebenbrunn was made up of 25 sand 63 silt and 12 clay the total organic carbon content of soil from mistelbach and obersiebenbrunn were 2 and 4 respectively analyzed with the walkley black chromic acid wet oxidation method the fourth sample was powdered kaolinite orange kaolin free of organic material from carl roth gmbh as a proxy for soil samples with high clay content kaolinite was preferred over other clay groups as it is commonly found in soil and has low plasticity due to its low plasticity soil will not deform easily during sample handling kaolinite also has a low swelling capacity compared to other types of clay soils foster 1954 it took less time to saturate and could be handled with less effort for analysis especially using 40 saturation level 2 2 sample preparation and analysis three kg of each soil sample with different textures were oven dried for three days at 105 c un sieved dried samples were placed into 1l volume cylinders and brought to 100 80 60 and 40 saturation level using different volumes of water in order to determine the amount of water needed to reach each saturation level the soil bulk density and porosity of each individual sample was calculated during sample preparation this calculation was done using the mass of the oven dried sample and the volume occupied in the 1l cylinder then the specific soil porosity of each soil sample in each cylinder was obtained from the calculated individual soil bulk density and an assumed particle density of 2 65 g cm3 the sample saturation process was done using water of known isotopic composition δ18o 11 2 0 δ 2h 77 8 0 1 water was applied slowly and close to the surface of the soil from the top of the 1l volume cylinders to prevent evaporative losses the cylinders were immediately and tightly covered with aluminum foil after the introduced water had infiltrated while it cannot be guaranteed that aluminum foil fully blocked evaporation the soil water isotopic composition was later measured to detect any possible changes from the original infiltration water see next paragraph for the exact procedure using rhizon samplers the advance of the wetting front was observed to be larger in sandy soil compared to the silty soil or kaolinite these saturated soils were left for seven days at a constant laboratory temperature 22 c to allow the introduced water to move through gravitation and adhesion along the soil pores in the cylinder next each soil sample was individually mixed and four replicates of approximately 200 250 g soil of each saturation level were broken into small aggregates and placed individually in ziploc brand double guard freezer bags with double zipper seal ca 1 l volume s c johnson sons inc usa additionally four replicates of 100 saturated soil samples were placed in 200 cm3 core cutters and sealed at the bottom using lids allowing only the top surface of the soil samples to be exposed to liquid vapor exchange in the ziploc bags this sampling method using core cutters was carried out only for 100 saturated soil samples to investigate the effect of the exposed soil surface area on the liquid vapor exchange process in ziploc bags each plastic sample bag was then inflated with dry atmospheric air and sealed quickly for water vapor equilibration the initial mass m1 of the inflated ziploc bags with soil samples was weighed and recorded using a mass balance 0 01 g the weighed inflated ziploc bags were double bagged using toppits brand freezer bags ca 3 l volume melitta gesellschaft gmbh salzburg austria the final mass m2 of the ziploc bags after sample storage and before headspace analysis were weighed and recorded to determine gravimetric water loss from the individual ziploc bags during the time of equilibration the different soil samples with variable water saturation levels were left to equilibrate and analyzed for headspace stable isotopic composition of water vapor after 24 h 48 h 72 h 96 h and 168 h rhizon samplers rhizon css 3 cm female luer lock rhizosphere research products b v wageningen the netherlands were used to extract four replicates of 1 ml of soil porewater from the remaining saturated soils in the 1l cylinders which were not sampled for the dlve method to obtain the initial water isotopic composition before equilibration reference water δ i briefly rhizon samplers are thin perforated rods of a microfiltration membrane with a nominal pore size of 0 12 0 18 µm they are constructed of hydrophilic membranes consisting of a blend of polyvinylpyrrolidine and polyethersulfone rhizosphere com 2021 to minimize potential isotope fractionation during soil sampling rhizon samplers were vertically inserted into the saturated soil samples and porewater was sampled from the middle soil depths instead nearer to the soil surface or bottom part after insertion a 10 ml syringe was connected to each sampler via a luer lock connection the plunger was pulled and a low pressure condition was created in the syringe the first 1 ml of the water was discarded from each syringe and 4 ml of porewater samples were collected geris et al 2015 steiner et al 2018 the extracted liquid porewaters were stored in replicates in 1 ml septum capped glass vials for stable isotope analysis additionally two control experiments were done to determine potential isotopic fractionation effects caused by extracting water using rhizon samplers the first control experiment compared the isotopic composition of four replicates of tap water in a laboratory beaker without soil that was extracted using rhizon samplers with the isotopic composition of tap water directly sampled into glass vials if no significant isotopic differences were found isotopic fractionation by the porous ceramic tip of the rhizon samplers could be considered negligible in the second control experiment a comparison was made between four replicates of the measured δ 18o and δ 2h values of rhizon extracted soil porewater and the isotopic composition of soil porewater as determined by the dlve method in 100 saturated soil conditions if no significant differences were found fully saturated soil did not cause fractionation during extraction of porewater with rhizon samplers finally if both control experiments show that rhizon samplers do not cause isotope fractionation during sampling the rhizon sampled porewater will be the reference water δ i representative of the soil porewater as the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic fractionation by liquid vapor equilibration is highly temperature dependent majoube 1971 the sample preparation and analysis were conducted isothermally at 22 0 5 c and all standards were treated the same way to ensure reproducibility the headspace vapor analysis of each sample was systematically started at the same time every day and finished within 174 min 20 samples five times four replicates and nine standards with about six minutes each analyses were also conducted in an identical sequence of 100 80 60 and 40 saturation followed by samples in core cutters the isotopic composition of porewater calculated from the four replicates of each soil texture and saturation level combination was averaged δ f and standard deviations sd were determined the difference δδ18o δ f δ i was calculated and evaluated with positive δδ18o indicating an isotopic enrichment of the sample compared to its reference water while negative δδ18o indicates isotopic depletion of porewater δδ18o values larger and lower than instrumental uncertainty next section suggested insufficient time for porewater to reach isotopic equilibrium with the headspace vapor in the bags possible main causes of isotope effects are soil matrix forces between the pore bound water and the water vapor phase in soil that eventually became the measured headspace water vapor vapor diffusion loss through the ziploc bags or back diffusion of laboratory air into the ziploc bags bag seal leakage was not considered as an effect since a seal leaking bag quickly and obviously deflated 2 3 laboratory analysis a crds laser spectroscope picarro l2130 i picarro inc santa clara ca usa was used to measure the isotopic composition of the headspace water vapor of soil samples and liquid water samples the accuracy of the crds analyzer for vapor analyses was 1 0 for δ 2h and 0 5 for δ18o picarro inc 2020 the δ 18o and δ 2h values are reported in per mil relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow craig 1961 following the protocol of wassenaar et al 2008 two in house standard waters with known liquid isotopic composition δ18o 11 2 0 1 δ 2h 77 2 0 7 and δ18o 6 3 0 δ 2h 47 9 0 1 were measured between two samples in the sequence of standard 1 sample 1 sample 2 and standard 2 for drift correction and normalization the headspace vapor was sampled for approximately 6 min and the final 60 s of the δ 2h and δ18o readings were averaged provided the standard deviation was 0 5 for δ 18o and 1 0 for δ 2h 3 results we first briefly discuss rhizon sampler results as it is important to verify that rhizon sampled porewater can be used as a reference and thus the δδ values of the main results of this study are valid from the first control experiment tap water from a laboratory beaker without soil extracted using rhizon samplers showed negligible isotope fractionation effects with differences of 0 1 for δ 2h and 0 for δ18o this means that the rhizon samplers themselves did not cause isotope fractionation the second control experiment determined whether the isotopic compositions of rhizon sampled water of 100 saturated soil and from dlve measured porewater differed it showed only small δδ18o and δδ 2h 0 2 δδ 2h and 0 1 δδ18o indicating a good comparability of rhizon sampled porewater and results of the dlve method at 100 saturation however there were differences between rhizon sampled porewater and the initial tap water for all soil textures and saturation levels rhizon sampled porewater of silty soil with 4 organic carbon had isotopic differences of 2 1 for δδ18o and 10 2 for δδ 2h and the rest of the soil samples had isotopic differences of 0 4 for δδ 18o and 1 4 for δδ 2h from the initial tap water thus independent of soil texture or saturation level only silty soil with 4 organic carbon showed large deviations from tap water when extracting porewater with rhizon samplers compared to the first control experiment with only pure water being extracted from a laboratory beaker we assume that specifically silty soil with 4 organic carbon and possibly specifically this sample for unknown reasons influenced the isotopic composition and not any soil in general in context of the second control experiments that showed no difference between dlve measurements and rhizon samplers at 100 saturation the dlve method would also be prone to the same effect a possible explanation is that the rhizon sampled porewater cannot be assumed to represent the water of the entire pore space but rather that of larger pores which are accessible to the rhizon samplers relatively low suction head other studies using different water extraction techniques such as cryogenic extraction orlowski et al 2013 azeotropic vacuum and microdistillation methods walker et al 1994 araguás araguás et al 1995 have also reported difficulties of obtaining the true isotopic composition meaning here the isotopic composition of the spiking water when extracting porewater which might be due to different water pools being sampled at different suction heads however the fact that in the present study larger isotopic differences only appeared for silty soil with 4 organic carbon indicated either the influence of organic matter on stable water isotopes see discussion section or other unknown factors specific to this soil sample as silty soil with 2 organic carbon was not affected there might also be a threshold value of organic carbon content necessary to significantly affect the isotopic composition as the exact reason does however remain unclear the rhizon sampled porewater was accepted as the reference water δ i for all soil samples with the caveat that results of silty soil with 4 organic carbon should be considered with caution 3 1 saturation effect overall the ranges of δδ 18o for the four saturation levels were low for sandy soil 1 1 to 0 and kaolinite 0 5 to 1 2 fig 1 repeated measurements showed similar standard deviations for sandy soil 0 9 to 0 1 and kaolinite 0 8 to 0 1 24 h was sufficient for porewater of sandy soil and kaolinite to reach isotopic equilibrium with the headspace vapor for most saturation levels except for 40 saturated kaolinite compared to sand and kaolinite silty soil with 2 organic carbon content generally had large δδ 18o 1 0 to 4 3 and sd 0 2 to 3 1 for all saturation levels and equilibration times similarly silty soil with 4 carbon content had larger δδ 18o 0 2 to 6 6 and sd 0 1 to 8 0 in comparison to all tested soil samples with few exceptions all δ 2h results were comparable to δ 18o results fig 2 for example the deviation of 80 saturated sandy soil for 96 h equilibration time was more pronounced in the case of δ 2h while δδ 2h results of kaolinite fell within measurement uncertainty except for 40 saturation the silty soils deviated from the rhizon sampled porewater 3 2 surface area effect fig 3 shows the effect of different equilibration times on δδ 18o and δδ 2h values for 100 saturated soil samples that were placed into core cutters for sandy soil and both silty soils the average δδ 18o and δδ 2h fell outside our uncertainty limit throughout the 168 h of equilibration silty soil with 2 organic carbon had the highest average δδ 18o δδ 2h compared to the other tested soil samples only kaolinite had δδ 18o δδ 2h values of 0 1 0 2 0 7 0 3 within the uncertainty range for up to 72 h for longer equilibration times δδ 18o δδ 2h values exceeded the uncertainty limits for kaolinite samples in general the δδ 18o δδ 2h of all 100 saturated soil samples placed in core cutters were larger than for loose soil samples 3 3 water loss effect the average water loss from the ziploc bags was low 0 0 3 with small sd values ranging from 0 to 0 1 for up to 168 h of equilibration time for all soil textures and saturation levels fig 4 and fig 5 the average water loss increased with equilibration time independent of soil texture and saturation level and did not influence δδ 18o or δδ 2h additionally the average δδ 18o and δδ 2h covered a larger range of values when the saturation level was lower even though the water losses from ziploc bags were 0 2 4 discussion sandy soil and kaolinite and two different silty soils with 2 and 4 organic carbon content were used to study the influence of soil textures and saturation levels on the isotopic equilibration time in ziploc bags prior to analysis using a laser spectrometer to determine the porewater isotopic composition the fraction of water loss caused by diffusion processes was 0 3 substantial 2 loss of water would lead to enriched isotopic values due to kinetic isotope fractionation after 240 360 h hendry et al 2015 as the water loss from the ziploc bags was 2 and samples were double bagged we assumed negligible kinetic isotope fractionation caused by possible diffusion and back diffusion processes which did not influence the oxygen and hydrogen isotope measurements also as both δ 18o and δ 2h outcomes were similar there was no indication of substantial influence of kinetic isotope fractionation processes we conclude that ziploc bags are effective for short term sample equilibrations up to a week compared to ziploc bags gralher et al 2021 found that toppits brand freezer bags were unacceptable for the dlve method due to excessive water vapor loss owing to thin plastic walls and high degradation of the bag material from uv effects although ziploc bags are food grade and not certified to be zipper seal leak tight changes in δ 18o and δ 2h were presumably either caused by effects related to soil properties or saturation level or both the initial dlve study of wassenaar et al 2008 investigated intact clay rich sediment cores with low permeability and found an optimum equilibration time was 72 96 h to avoid evaporative enrichment due to vapor leakage which became apparent not until 288 h of equilibration time they assumed soils of high permeability would require less equilibration time and the results of our study confirm this as sand needed only 24 h to reach isotopic equilibrium regardless of water saturation level surprisingly kaolinite equilibrated within 24 h too and maintained isotopic equilibrium up to 168 h the only exception was 40 saturated kaolinite but the δδ 18o for those samples were still close to the measurement uncertainty of 0 5 fig 1 this might indicate that with even lower saturation levels kaolinite δδ 18o could increase further beyond the measurement uncertainty however wang et al 2019 analyzed clay rich samples with a gravimetric water content as low as 5 0 05 g g 1 and found they equilibrated within 24 h even if both indicate dry soil the gravimetric water content and saturation level are not directly comparable and further experiments with lower saturation levels are needed to conclude if kaolinite will equilibrate within 24 h or not to confirm the findings of wang et al 2019 we initially expected a difference in equilibration time between sand and clay due to their different matric forces as gaj et al 2016 showed high matric forces of intact soil slow down the water vapor equilibration process however the soils used in this study and wang et al 2019 were disaggregated sieved to 2 mm respectively this likely created a larger surface to volume ratio of porewater exposed to the headspace water vapor molecular diffusion thus enabled liquid vapor isotopic equilibrium to be reached in a short time thereby possibly eliminating the effect of soil texture silt however reacted differently and did not equilibrate isotopically within 24 h a major difference between the silt samples and sand or clay was the presence of particulate organic carbon discussed later we recommend sieving or breaking down solid samples into smaller pieces to measure the porewater isotopic composition as precisely and quickly as possible our results suggest that ziploc bags can be used to store samples for up to 168 h without isotopic enrichment for sandy and clay soils free of organic carbon contrary to sandy and clay soils free of organic carbon the two silty samples with 2 and 4 organic carbon contents behaved inconsistently reaching and departing from isotopic equilibrium at seemingly random hours of equilibration time since silt is a particle size fraction between sand and clay this behavior was unexpected the presence of organic carbon content in both silty samples compared to sandy and clay soils might have interfered with the equilibration process as shown by gaj and mcdonnell 2019 the presence of particulate organic matter in soils influenced the isotopic equilibrium fractionation by increasing the rate of liquid vapor exchange processes which were attributed to changes in the soil hydraulic conductivity and solid interfacial chemistry orlowski et al 2016 also showed that increasing organic matter content negatively impacts the isotopic measurements of physically extracted soil water however they used the cryogenic extraction method and not the dlve method as in the present study and results may differ our results using the dlve method showed that δ 18o and δ 2h values of both silty soils could have been similarly affected by the presence of sedimentary organic carbon weak organic acids cooh in organic carbon contain exchangeable hydrogen atoms that cannot be removed easily but react readily with water molecules meißner et al 2014 and this can cause significant isotopic deviation between the reference and measured isotopic composition of water isotopes while the deviations of δ 2h fig 2 would fit this hypothesis δ 18o also showed similar behavior which cannot be explained by cooh functional groups fig 1 the impact of organic carbon on the dlve method requires further study to understand the processes potentially causing isotopic fractionation spiking oven dried soil with isotopic reference water is the most widely used technique to determine the performances and accuracy of the dlve method thielemann et al 2019 and gaj et al 2016 speculated that oven drying soil samples at 105 c does not completely remove the residual water which in turn can cause an isotope exchange between soil bound water and reference water particularly in fine textured soils when the oven dried soil is rewetted with reference water this could explain the measured δ 18o and δ 2h values of soil water in silty soils that deviated from the reference water figs 1 and 2 values since those samples were taken from field sites it is possible that the residual water that entered the soil prior to sampling was bound in the smaller pores and not removed by standard oven drying this might be relevant for silty soils because the residual water content for sand is close to zero and the kaolinite was a dry powder compared to the broken down soil samples samples packed in core cutters took considerably longer to reach isotopic equilibrium if at all fig 3 the increase in equilibration time might have been caused by the smaller soil surface area exposed to liquid vapor exchange compared to broken down soil the reduced surface area in contact with the headspace limited the water vapor diffusion out of the soil by limiting the available pathways for diffusion less surface area in contact with the air less pathways ending at the soil air interface of all samples tested with the core cutters only kaolinite attained isotopic equilibrium after 72 h while the rest of soil samples had enriched isotopic compositions the fact that only kaolinite reached equilibrium could have been because clay has the comparatively highest porosity and surface area of saturated pore spaces carman 1939 exposed to the atmosphere in the ziploc bags for liquid vapor exchange saturation levels 100 were not tested in the present study with core cutters and results might be different when using drier soil samples the isotopic deviations of aggregated silty soils with organic carbon were larger than sandy soil and kaolinite free of organic carbon similar to the results observed when the soils were broken down hence regardless of water saturation level or sampling technique the presence of organic carbon appears to be a limitation to the application for the dlve and all other water extraction methods the results from this study are a step towards achieving better protocols of equilibration time of different soils depending on their saturation level using the dlve method for sand and clay free of organic carbon the equilibration time can be reduced to 24 h or samples can be stored up to 168 h the presence of sedimentary organic carbon regardless of its concentration level remains a serious issue for all approaches where organic carbon removal techniques cannot be practically applied this finding supports the study by oerter and bowen 2017 in which in situ isotope measurements of sandy loam showed isotopic enrichment in soil with 2 organic materials mulch a possible explanation was given by lin and horita 2016 who found less isotopic fractionation when porewater equilibrated with ambient air compared to bulk water equilibrating with it which they argued was due to hydrophilic interactions between porewater and soil particles as organic matter could also interact with the porewater the isotopic fractionation might have been affected in this study 5 summary and conclusion our findings suggest that for disaggregated sandy soils with saturation levels as low as 40 24 h of equilibration time was sufficient when using ziploc bags with the dlve method 24 h sufficed also for loose kaolinite up to 60 saturation but 48 h was required when the saturation level was reduced to 40 by contrast silty soil with 2 organic carbon content behaved erratically seemingly reaching equilibrium at random loose silty soil with 4 organic carbon on the other hand did not reach isotopic equilibrium based on comparison measurements with soils put into core cutters we recommend that samples be broken down into smaller aggregates to reduce the time required for reaching equilibrium ziploc bags were shown to exhibit no evaporative impact on δ 18o and δ 2h up to 168 h and hence are suitable short term sample storage and equilibration bags deviations of both δ 18o and δ 2h were found that might have been influenced by organic carbon in the two silty loam soils but the exact reasons remain unknown further research is needed to understand the influence of soil organic carbon on isotopic measurements using the dlve method credit authorship

3619,the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes of water δ 2h and δ 18o are powerful tracers for studying subsurface water flow processes but the extraction of porewater from unsaturated soil is complex and laborious the direct liquid vapor equilibration method dlve for isotope analysis overcomes this challenge by analyzing headspace vapor in isotopic equilibrium with the porewater under closed system conditions however the effect of the equilibration time soil texture and porewater saturation on isotopic results is not fully understood yet we tested three differently textured disaggregated soils sandy silty loam and clay to assess how the equilibration time is impacted by i porewater saturation 100 80 60 and 40 and ii soil surface area for all tests the water loss through diffusion was negligible 0 3 the experiments showed that for disaggregated sandy soil 24 h was a sufficient isotopic equilibration time regardless of water saturation level similarly 24 h was sufficient for kaolinite samples with 100 saturation exhibiting little isotopic variance even after 168 h of equilibration for saturated silty loam with 2 organic carbon content 96 h was the optimal equilibration time whereas saturated silty loam with 4 organic carbon content did not reach isotopic equilibrium by 168 h the optimal equilibration time increased depending on whether soil samples were disaggregated or kept in a core cutter inconclusive results for silty soils with organic carbon revealed the need to further investigate the possible influence of organic carbon on the dlve method keywords direct liquid vapor equilibration method dlve water stable isotopes sample preparation cavity ring down spectroscopy crds 1 introduction the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes of water δ 2h and δ 18o are used to trace water in the hydrological cycle in the absence of piezometers or lysimeters porewater cannot be sampled directly and needs to be extracted from soil sediment or geologic samples typically using laboratory based water extraction techniques such as high speed centrifugation azeotropic distillation allison and hughes 1983 cryogenic micro distillation araguas araguas et al 1995 microwave distillation munksgaard et al 2014 mechanical squeezing white et al 1985 cryogenic vacuum extraction koeniger et al 2011 and the accelerated solvent extraction technique zhu et al 2014 however a review by kelln et al 2001 showed large differences in porewater isotopic composition obtained from clay rich soils using centrifugation mechanical squeezing and azeotropic distillation methods inter laboratory comparisons further revealed large discrepancies between measured δ 18o and δ 2h values using different liquid water extraction methods orlowski et al 2018 beyer et al 2020 hence different porewater extraction methods lead to incomparable isotopic compositions which emphasizes the need for sound and adoptable measurement protocols as an alternative to liquid water extraction methods porewater can be proxy analyzed in the laboratory by using the direct liquid vapor equilibration dlve method and laser based spectrometry wassenaar et al 2008 apart from laboratory analysis in situ equilibration of porewater was also developed using gas permeable tubes or soil gas probes for soils rothfuss et al 2013 gaj et al 2016 or using porous probes for analyzing isotopes in tree xylem water volkmann et al 2016 the dlve method is based on the equilibration between soil porewater and water vapor contained in the headspace of a closed sealable bag wassenaar et al 2008 briefly liquid water used as standards or soil samples are equilibrated at constant temperature in re sealable collapsible plastic ziploc bags filled with dry air after 24 72 h the fully equilibrated 100 relative humidity vapor headspace is analyzed as an isotopic proxy for the liquid porewater using cavity ring down spectroscopy crds or off axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy oa icos the isotopic equilibration time in the ziploc bags is affected by the soil texture soil volume soil chemistry soil saturation level and soil sampling method wassenaar et al 2008 gaj et al 2018 gaj and mcdonnell 2019 wang et al 2019 hendry et al 2013 the soil matric potential was found to influence the isotopic equilibrium fractionation factor of differently textured soil samples stored for only 24 h before analysis gaj et al 2018 gaj and mcdonnell 2019 while liquid water needs 10 min to reach full water vapor isotopic equilibrium in ziploc bags at 22 c wassenaar et al 2008 the equilibration time for soil samples is longer and depends on soil texture for example clayey soils with low hydraulic conductivity take considerably longer to reach porewater vapor isotopic equilibrium compared to sandy soil of higher hydraulic conductivity wassenaar et al 2008 previous studies used equilibration times ranging from hours to several days and no standardized protocol for different soil or sediment samples exists yet garvelmann et al 2012 equilibrated soil samples for 15 h for sandy and sandy loam texture müller et al 2014 equilibrated samples for 15 h in laminated polyester bags using different soil texture from two steep hillslopes in the central alps switzerland different soil texture fluvial gravel coarse sand silt silty loam loam and clayey loam from three study sites in temperate central europe were equilibrated for 48 h by sprenger et al 2015 hendry et al 2013 obtained an accurate porewater isotopic composition of fine textured soil samples by equilibrating cretaceous sediments for seven days additionally wang et al 2019 found that 12 24 h were sufficient to reach an equilibrium in ziploc bags for soils with different clay and water content initially wassenaar et al 2008 suggested that sand with 5 gravimetric water content and consolidated shale were unsuitable for the dlve method as evaporative isotopic enrichment in δ 18o and δ 2h in the headspace vapor of ziploc bags was observed during longer equilibration time additionally wang et al 2019 observed isotopic enrichment of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes for dry soil samples with different clay contents to restrict isotopic enrichment induced by the diffusion of water vapor out of the bag hendry et al 2015 suggested increasing the sample size to buffer evaporation enrichment in the remaining porewater wang et al 2019 and orlowski et al 2016 showed that clay and water content must also be considered for the conversion and calibration of the water vapor isotopic composition into the porewater isotopic composition contrary to previous findings gaj et al 2016 obtained porewater isotope measurements with good precision δ18o 0 8 δ 2h 2 5 for medium sand soils with 1 vol soil water content in a semi arid region in namibia using water vapor equilibration techniques with two different laser spectrometers oa icos and crds these studies altogether indicate that the potential and concomitant influences of different soil textures and saturation levels on isotopic enrichment in equilibration bags needs to be further explored this should be done to gain a better understanding of how to reliably measure soil samples using the dlve method the use of resealable inflatable plastic bags also revealed technical problems from minor water vapor loss out of the bags through diffusive transport and back diffusion of vapor from laboratory air into the bags wassenaar et al 2008 hendry et al 2015 low cost plastic freezer bags with double zipper seals were initially used but were vulnerable to leakage and evaporative loss wassenaar et al 2008 double bagging greatly improved this and later investigation by hendry et al 2015 showed water loss from ziploc bags crystal clear bags and isopak were larger than from mylar black bags and silver pouches the latter albeit more costly are preferable for up to 50 days of sample storage and avoiding water loss additionally mattei et al 2019 found that large re usable fold a carrier reliance plastic carboys allowed 30 days of sample storage albeit at a higher cost of 10 usd bag however it was observed that resealable bags which were too airtight did not allow spectrally interfering biogenic gases to escape biogenic gas buildup is produced in situ during long equilibration times and negatively interferes with the laser isotope spectral analyses gralher et al 2018 hendry et al 2011 interferences from biogenic carbon dioxide co2 can be corrected by using sensitivity spectral features recorded with the crds analyzers gralher et al 2018 thus it appears that low cost ziploc plastic freezer bags are sufficiently airtight to allow for water isotope analysis performed within 10 days before evaporative loss becomes apparent while at the same time minimizing biogenic gas buildup hendry et al 2015 in most studies the dlve method is operationally carried out using different i sample storage bags ii soil sample sizes iii treatment procedures and iv equilibration times hendry et al 2015 orlowski et al 2016 gralher et al 2018 gaj et al 2018 gaj and mcdonnell 2019 gralher et al 2021 however it remains unclear how different saturation levels and equilibration times affect the isotopic analyses of porewater in soils having different physicochemical characteristics thus to investigate the effect of varying soil textures and saturation levels on the porewater vapor equilibration process in a closed system a series of laboratory experiments were conducted different soil samples sandy silty loam and clay with varied saturation levels 100 80 60 and 40 were equilibrated for different times under isothermal conditions this study aims at improving our understanding on the application and possible limitations of the dlve method to analyze the stable isotopic composition of soil porewater 2 methods 2 1 soil material four different soil samples with different chemical and physical properties were studied table 1 sandy soil free of organic carbon was obtained from a gravel pit in bruckmühl near munich germany based on laboratory dry sieving the sample consisted of 10 fine sand 31 medium sand 28 coarse sand and 30 fine gravel clay and silt accounted for ca 1 the silty loam samples were topsoil from two different field sites in lower austria one being mistelbach and the other obersiebenbrunn based on wet sieving and sedimentation the soil from mistelbach consisted of 11 sand 64 silt and 25 clay while soil from obersiebenbrunn was made up of 25 sand 63 silt and 12 clay the total organic carbon content of soil from mistelbach and obersiebenbrunn were 2 and 4 respectively analyzed with the walkley black chromic acid wet oxidation method the fourth sample was powdered kaolinite orange kaolin free of organic material from carl roth gmbh as a proxy for soil samples with high clay content kaolinite was preferred over other clay groups as it is commonly found in soil and has low plasticity due to its low plasticity soil will not deform easily during sample handling kaolinite also has a low swelling capacity compared to other types of clay soils foster 1954 it took less time to saturate and could be handled with less effort for analysis especially using 40 saturation level 2 2 sample preparation and analysis three kg of each soil sample with different textures were oven dried for three days at 105 c un sieved dried samples were placed into 1l volume cylinders and brought to 100 80 60 and 40 saturation level using different volumes of water in order to determine the amount of water needed to reach each saturation level the soil bulk density and porosity of each individual sample was calculated during sample preparation this calculation was done using the mass of the oven dried sample and the volume occupied in the 1l cylinder then the specific soil porosity of each soil sample in each cylinder was obtained from the calculated individual soil bulk density and an assumed particle density of 2 65 g cm3 the sample saturation process was done using water of known isotopic composition δ18o 11 2 0 δ 2h 77 8 0 1 water was applied slowly and close to the surface of the soil from the top of the 1l volume cylinders to prevent evaporative losses the cylinders were immediately and tightly covered with aluminum foil after the introduced water had infiltrated while it cannot be guaranteed that aluminum foil fully blocked evaporation the soil water isotopic composition was later measured to detect any possible changes from the original infiltration water see next paragraph for the exact procedure using rhizon samplers the advance of the wetting front was observed to be larger in sandy soil compared to the silty soil or kaolinite these saturated soils were left for seven days at a constant laboratory temperature 22 c to allow the introduced water to move through gravitation and adhesion along the soil pores in the cylinder next each soil sample was individually mixed and four replicates of approximately 200 250 g soil of each saturation level were broken into small aggregates and placed individually in ziploc brand double guard freezer bags with double zipper seal ca 1 l volume s c johnson sons inc usa additionally four replicates of 100 saturated soil samples were placed in 200 cm3 core cutters and sealed at the bottom using lids allowing only the top surface of the soil samples to be exposed to liquid vapor exchange in the ziploc bags this sampling method using core cutters was carried out only for 100 saturated soil samples to investigate the effect of the exposed soil surface area on the liquid vapor exchange process in ziploc bags each plastic sample bag was then inflated with dry atmospheric air and sealed quickly for water vapor equilibration the initial mass m1 of the inflated ziploc bags with soil samples was weighed and recorded using a mass balance 0 01 g the weighed inflated ziploc bags were double bagged using toppits brand freezer bags ca 3 l volume melitta gesellschaft gmbh salzburg austria the final mass m2 of the ziploc bags after sample storage and before headspace analysis were weighed and recorded to determine gravimetric water loss from the individual ziploc bags during the time of equilibration the different soil samples with variable water saturation levels were left to equilibrate and analyzed for headspace stable isotopic composition of water vapor after 24 h 48 h 72 h 96 h and 168 h rhizon samplers rhizon css 3 cm female luer lock rhizosphere research products b v wageningen the netherlands were used to extract four replicates of 1 ml of soil porewater from the remaining saturated soils in the 1l cylinders which were not sampled for the dlve method to obtain the initial water isotopic composition before equilibration reference water δ i briefly rhizon samplers are thin perforated rods of a microfiltration membrane with a nominal pore size of 0 12 0 18 µm they are constructed of hydrophilic membranes consisting of a blend of polyvinylpyrrolidine and polyethersulfone rhizosphere com 2021 to minimize potential isotope fractionation during soil sampling rhizon samplers were vertically inserted into the saturated soil samples and porewater was sampled from the middle soil depths instead nearer to the soil surface or bottom part after insertion a 10 ml syringe was connected to each sampler via a luer lock connection the plunger was pulled and a low pressure condition was created in the syringe the first 1 ml of the water was discarded from each syringe and 4 ml of porewater samples were collected geris et al 2015 steiner et al 2018 the extracted liquid porewaters were stored in replicates in 1 ml septum capped glass vials for stable isotope analysis additionally two control experiments were done to determine potential isotopic fractionation effects caused by extracting water using rhizon samplers the first control experiment compared the isotopic composition of four replicates of tap water in a laboratory beaker without soil that was extracted using rhizon samplers with the isotopic composition of tap water directly sampled into glass vials if no significant isotopic differences were found isotopic fractionation by the porous ceramic tip of the rhizon samplers could be considered negligible in the second control experiment a comparison was made between four replicates of the measured δ 18o and δ 2h values of rhizon extracted soil porewater and the isotopic composition of soil porewater as determined by the dlve method in 100 saturated soil conditions if no significant differences were found fully saturated soil did not cause fractionation during extraction of porewater with rhizon samplers finally if both control experiments show that rhizon samplers do not cause isotope fractionation during sampling the rhizon sampled porewater will be the reference water δ i representative of the soil porewater as the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic fractionation by liquid vapor equilibration is highly temperature dependent majoube 1971 the sample preparation and analysis were conducted isothermally at 22 0 5 c and all standards were treated the same way to ensure reproducibility the headspace vapor analysis of each sample was systematically started at the same time every day and finished within 174 min 20 samples five times four replicates and nine standards with about six minutes each analyses were also conducted in an identical sequence of 100 80 60 and 40 saturation followed by samples in core cutters the isotopic composition of porewater calculated from the four replicates of each soil texture and saturation level combination was averaged δ f and standard deviations sd were determined the difference δδ18o δ f δ i was calculated and evaluated with positive δδ18o indicating an isotopic enrichment of the sample compared to its reference water while negative δδ18o indicates isotopic depletion of porewater δδ18o values larger and lower than instrumental uncertainty next section suggested insufficient time for porewater to reach isotopic equilibrium with the headspace vapor in the bags possible main causes of isotope effects are soil matrix forces between the pore bound water and the water vapor phase in soil that eventually became the measured headspace water vapor vapor diffusion loss through the ziploc bags or back diffusion of laboratory air into the ziploc bags bag seal leakage was not considered as an effect since a seal leaking bag quickly and obviously deflated 2 3 laboratory analysis a crds laser spectroscope picarro l2130 i picarro inc santa clara ca usa was used to measure the isotopic composition of the headspace water vapor of soil samples and liquid water samples the accuracy of the crds analyzer for vapor analyses was 1 0 for δ 2h and 0 5 for δ18o picarro inc 2020 the δ 18o and δ 2h values are reported in per mil relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow craig 1961 following the protocol of wassenaar et al 2008 two in house standard waters with known liquid isotopic composition δ18o 11 2 0 1 δ 2h 77 2 0 7 and δ18o 6 3 0 δ 2h 47 9 0 1 were measured between two samples in the sequence of standard 1 sample 1 sample 2 and standard 2 for drift correction and normalization the headspace vapor was sampled for approximately 6 min and the final 60 s of the δ 2h and δ18o readings were averaged provided the standard deviation was 0 5 for δ 18o and 1 0 for δ 2h 3 results we first briefly discuss rhizon sampler results as it is important to verify that rhizon sampled porewater can be used as a reference and thus the δδ values of the main results of this study are valid from the first control experiment tap water from a laboratory beaker without soil extracted using rhizon samplers showed negligible isotope fractionation effects with differences of 0 1 for δ 2h and 0 for δ18o this means that the rhizon samplers themselves did not cause isotope fractionation the second control experiment determined whether the isotopic compositions of rhizon sampled water of 100 saturated soil and from dlve measured porewater differed it showed only small δδ18o and δδ 2h 0 2 δδ 2h and 0 1 δδ18o indicating a good comparability of rhizon sampled porewater and results of the dlve method at 100 saturation however there were differences between rhizon sampled porewater and the initial tap water for all soil textures and saturation levels rhizon sampled porewater of silty soil with 4 organic carbon had isotopic differences of 2 1 for δδ18o and 10 2 for δδ 2h and the rest of the soil samples had isotopic differences of 0 4 for δδ 18o and 1 4 for δδ 2h from the initial tap water thus independent of soil texture or saturation level only silty soil with 4 organic carbon showed large deviations from tap water when extracting porewater with rhizon samplers compared to the first control experiment with only pure water being extracted from a laboratory beaker we assume that specifically silty soil with 4 organic carbon and possibly specifically this sample for unknown reasons influenced the isotopic composition and not any soil in general in context of the second control experiments that showed no difference between dlve measurements and rhizon samplers at 100 saturation the dlve method would also be prone to the same effect a possible explanation is that the rhizon sampled porewater cannot be assumed to represent the water of the entire pore space but rather that of larger pores which are accessible to the rhizon samplers relatively low suction head other studies using different water extraction techniques such as cryogenic extraction orlowski et al 2013 azeotropic vacuum and microdistillation methods walker et al 1994 araguás araguás et al 1995 have also reported difficulties of obtaining the true isotopic composition meaning here the isotopic composition of the spiking water when extracting porewater which might be due to different water pools being sampled at different suction heads however the fact that in the present study larger isotopic differences only appeared for silty soil with 4 organic carbon indicated either the influence of organic matter on stable water isotopes see discussion section or other unknown factors specific to this soil sample as silty soil with 2 organic carbon was not affected there might also be a threshold value of organic carbon content necessary to significantly affect the isotopic composition as the exact reason does however remain unclear the rhizon sampled porewater was accepted as the reference water δ i for all soil samples with the caveat that results of silty soil with 4 organic carbon should be considered with caution 3 1 saturation effect overall the ranges of δδ 18o for the four saturation levels were low for sandy soil 1 1 to 0 and kaolinite 0 5 to 1 2 fig 1 repeated measurements showed similar standard deviations for sandy soil 0 9 to 0 1 and kaolinite 0 8 to 0 1 24 h was sufficient for porewater of sandy soil and kaolinite to reach isotopic equilibrium with the headspace vapor for most saturation levels except for 40 saturated kaolinite compared to sand and kaolinite silty soil with 2 organic carbon content generally had large δδ 18o 1 0 to 4 3 and sd 0 2 to 3 1 for all saturation levels and equilibration times similarly silty soil with 4 carbon content had larger δδ 18o 0 2 to 6 6 and sd 0 1 to 8 0 in comparison to all tested soil samples with few exceptions all δ 2h results were comparable to δ 18o results fig 2 for example the deviation of 80 saturated sandy soil for 96 h equilibration time was more pronounced in the case of δ 2h while δδ 2h results of kaolinite fell within measurement uncertainty except for 40 saturation the silty soils deviated from the rhizon sampled porewater 3 2 surface area effect fig 3 shows the effect of different equilibration times on δδ 18o and δδ 2h values for 100 saturated soil samples that were placed into core cutters for sandy soil and both silty soils the average δδ 18o and δδ 2h fell outside our uncertainty limit throughout the 168 h of equilibration silty soil with 2 organic carbon had the highest average δδ 18o δδ 2h compared to the other tested soil samples only kaolinite had δδ 18o δδ 2h values of 0 1 0 2 0 7 0 3 within the uncertainty range for up to 72 h for longer equilibration times δδ 18o δδ 2h values exceeded the uncertainty limits for kaolinite samples in general the δδ 18o δδ 2h of all 100 saturated soil samples placed in core cutters were larger than for loose soil samples 3 3 water loss effect the average water loss from the ziploc bags was low 0 0 3 with small sd values ranging from 0 to 0 1 for up to 168 h of equilibration time for all soil textures and saturation levels fig 4 and fig 5 the average water loss increased with equilibration time independent of soil texture and saturation level and did not influence δδ 18o or δδ 2h additionally the average δδ 18o and δδ 2h covered a larger range of values when the saturation level was lower even though the water losses from ziploc bags were 0 2 4 discussion sandy soil and kaolinite and two different silty soils with 2 and 4 organic carbon content were used to study the influence of soil textures and saturation levels on the isotopic equilibration time in ziploc bags prior to analysis using a laser spectrometer to determine the porewater isotopic composition the fraction of water loss caused by diffusion processes was 0 3 substantial 2 loss of water would lead to enriched isotopic values due to kinetic isotope fractionation after 240 360 h hendry et al 2015 as the water loss from the ziploc bags was 2 and samples were double bagged we assumed negligible kinetic isotope fractionation caused by possible diffusion and back diffusion processes which did not influence the oxygen and hydrogen isotope measurements also as both δ 18o and δ 2h outcomes were similar there was no indication of substantial influence of kinetic isotope fractionation processes we conclude that ziploc bags are effective for short term sample equilibrations up to a week compared to ziploc bags gralher et al 2021 found that toppits brand freezer bags were unacceptable for the dlve method due to excessive water vapor loss owing to thin plastic walls and high degradation of the bag material from uv effects although ziploc bags are food grade and not certified to be zipper seal leak tight changes in δ 18o and δ 2h were presumably either caused by effects related to soil properties or saturation level or both the initial dlve study of wassenaar et al 2008 investigated intact clay rich sediment cores with low permeability and found an optimum equilibration time was 72 96 h to avoid evaporative enrichment due to vapor leakage which became apparent not until 288 h of equilibration time they assumed soils of high permeability would require less equilibration time and the results of our study confirm this as sand needed only 24 h to reach isotopic equilibrium regardless of water saturation level surprisingly kaolinite equilibrated within 24 h too and maintained isotopic equilibrium up to 168 h the only exception was 40 saturated kaolinite but the δδ 18o for those samples were still close to the measurement uncertainty of 0 5 fig 1 this might indicate that with even lower saturation levels kaolinite δδ 18o could increase further beyond the measurement uncertainty however wang et al 2019 analyzed clay rich samples with a gravimetric water content as low as 5 0 05 g g 1 and found they equilibrated within 24 h even if both indicate dry soil the gravimetric water content and saturation level are not directly comparable and further experiments with lower saturation levels are needed to conclude if kaolinite will equilibrate within 24 h or not to confirm the findings of wang et al 2019 we initially expected a difference in equilibration time between sand and clay due to their different matric forces as gaj et al 2016 showed high matric forces of intact soil slow down the water vapor equilibration process however the soils used in this study and wang et al 2019 were disaggregated sieved to 2 mm respectively this likely created a larger surface to volume ratio of porewater exposed to the headspace water vapor molecular diffusion thus enabled liquid vapor isotopic equilibrium to be reached in a short time thereby possibly eliminating the effect of soil texture silt however reacted differently and did not equilibrate isotopically within 24 h a major difference between the silt samples and sand or clay was the presence of particulate organic carbon discussed later we recommend sieving or breaking down solid samples into smaller pieces to measure the porewater isotopic composition as precisely and quickly as possible our results suggest that ziploc bags can be used to store samples for up to 168 h without isotopic enrichment for sandy and clay soils free of organic carbon contrary to sandy and clay soils free of organic carbon the two silty samples with 2 and 4 organic carbon contents behaved inconsistently reaching and departing from isotopic equilibrium at seemingly random hours of equilibration time since silt is a particle size fraction between sand and clay this behavior was unexpected the presence of organic carbon content in both silty samples compared to sandy and clay soils might have interfered with the equilibration process as shown by gaj and mcdonnell 2019 the presence of particulate organic matter in soils influenced the isotopic equilibrium fractionation by increasing the rate of liquid vapor exchange processes which were attributed to changes in the soil hydraulic conductivity and solid interfacial chemistry orlowski et al 2016 also showed that increasing organic matter content negatively impacts the isotopic measurements of physically extracted soil water however they used the cryogenic extraction method and not the dlve method as in the present study and results may differ our results using the dlve method showed that δ 18o and δ 2h values of both silty soils could have been similarly affected by the presence of sedimentary organic carbon weak organic acids cooh in organic carbon contain exchangeable hydrogen atoms that cannot be removed easily but react readily with water molecules meißner et al 2014 and this can cause significant isotopic deviation between the reference and measured isotopic composition of water isotopes while the deviations of δ 2h fig 2 would fit this hypothesis δ 18o also showed similar behavior which cannot be explained by cooh functional groups fig 1 the impact of organic carbon on the dlve method requires further study to understand the processes potentially causing isotopic fractionation spiking oven dried soil with isotopic reference water is the most widely used technique to determine the performances and accuracy of the dlve method thielemann et al 2019 and gaj et al 2016 speculated that oven drying soil samples at 105 c does not completely remove the residual water which in turn can cause an isotope exchange between soil bound water and reference water particularly in fine textured soils when the oven dried soil is rewetted with reference water this could explain the measured δ 18o and δ 2h values of soil water in silty soils that deviated from the reference water figs 1 and 2 values since those samples were taken from field sites it is possible that the residual water that entered the soil prior to sampling was bound in the smaller pores and not removed by standard oven drying this might be relevant for silty soils because the residual water content for sand is close to zero and the kaolinite was a dry powder compared to the broken down soil samples samples packed in core cutters took considerably longer to reach isotopic equilibrium if at all fig 3 the increase in equilibration time might have been caused by the smaller soil surface area exposed to liquid vapor exchange compared to broken down soil the reduced surface area in contact with the headspace limited the water vapor diffusion out of the soil by limiting the available pathways for diffusion less surface area in contact with the air less pathways ending at the soil air interface of all samples tested with the core cutters only kaolinite attained isotopic equilibrium after 72 h while the rest of soil samples had enriched isotopic compositions the fact that only kaolinite reached equilibrium could have been because clay has the comparatively highest porosity and surface area of saturated pore spaces carman 1939 exposed to the atmosphere in the ziploc bags for liquid vapor exchange saturation levels 100 were not tested in the present study with core cutters and results might be different when using drier soil samples the isotopic deviations of aggregated silty soils with organic carbon were larger than sandy soil and kaolinite free of organic carbon similar to the results observed when the soils were broken down hence regardless of water saturation level or sampling technique the presence of organic carbon appears to be a limitation to the application for the dlve and all other water extraction methods the results from this study are a step towards achieving better protocols of equilibration time of different soils depending on their saturation level using the dlve method for sand and clay free of organic carbon the equilibration time can be reduced to 24 h or samples can be stored up to 168 h the presence of sedimentary organic carbon regardless of its concentration level remains a serious issue for all approaches where organic carbon removal techniques cannot be practically applied this finding supports the study by oerter and bowen 2017 in which in situ isotope measurements of sandy loam showed isotopic enrichment in soil with 2 organic materials mulch a possible explanation was given by lin and horita 2016 who found less isotopic fractionation when porewater equilibrated with ambient air compared to bulk water equilibrating with it which they argued was due to hydrophilic interactions between porewater and soil particles as organic matter could also interact with the porewater the isotopic fractionation might have been affected in this study 5 summary and conclusion our findings suggest that for disaggregated sandy soils with saturation levels as low as 40 24 h of equilibration time was sufficient when using ziploc bags with the dlve method 24 h sufficed also for loose kaolinite up to 60 saturation but 48 h was required when the saturation level was reduced to 40 by contrast silty soil with 2 organic carbon content behaved erratically seemingly reaching equilibrium at random loose silty soil with 4 organic carbon on the other hand did not reach isotopic equilibrium based on comparison measurements with soils put into core cutters we recommend that samples be broken down into smaller aggregates to reduce the time required for reaching equilibrium ziploc bags were shown to exhibit no evaporative impact on δ 18o and δ 2h up to 168 h and hence are suitable short term sample storage and equilibration bags deviations of both δ 18o and δ 2h were found that might have been influenced by organic carbon in the two silty loam soils but the exact reasons remain unknown further research is needed to understand the influence of soil organic carbon on isotopic measurements using the dlve method credit authorship
