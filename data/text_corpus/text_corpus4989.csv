24945,herd formation in animal populations for example to escape a predator or coordinate feeding is a widespread phenomenon understanding which interactions between individual animals are important for generating such emergent self organisation has been a key focus of ecological and mathematical research here we show the relationship between the algorithmic rules of herd forming agents and the mathematical structure of the corresponding spatial moment dynamics this entails scaling up from the rules of individual herd generating behaviour to the macroscopic dynamics of herd structure the model employs a mechanism for neighbour dependent directionally biased movement to explore how individual interactions generate aggregation and repulsion in groups of animals our results show that a combination of mutually attractive and repulsive interactions with different spatial scales is sufficient to lead to the stable formation of groups with a characteristic size keywords collective behaviour herd formation moment closure approximation neighbourhood interactions spatial point process 1 introduction the self organisation of animals into herds and the use of individual based models to learn about the rules underlying this process is a core subject in behavioural ecology krause et al 2002 herd formation is most often considered in terms of movements of individuals biased by their interactions at small spatial scales however these movements can affect the dynamics of populations and communities at larger spatial scales in his seminal work geometry for the selfish herd hamilton 1971 proposed that aggregation of animals into groups or herds could be driven by the selfish desire of an animal to reduce its predation risk by manoeuvring to positions that would place other population members closer to the predator underlying this idea was the concept of an animal s domain of danger a region of space containing all points nearer to that individual than to any other individual the larger an animal s domain of danger the greater its risk of predation and hamilton therefore theorised that aggregation arose simply due to each animal undergoing movements towards its nearest neighbour to reduce the size of its domain of danger stemming from this original idea james et al 2004 considered a model with greater biological realism by incorporating a limited domain of danger representing either a limited detection range or attack range of predators that could be applied to animal groups of finite size further work by reluga and viscido 2005 pointed out that rules for generating realistic selfish herds need interactions beyond an individual s nearest neighbours and showed how predation based selection could increase the influence of distant neighbours other models explored animal aggregation behaviour by introducing sensory zones of individuals for example zones of repulsion or attraction that drive animals towards or away from neighbouring individuals giving rise to higher order structure in the population couzin et al 2002 wood and ackland 2007 bode 2011 herbert read et al 2011 one such model proposed by lukeman et al 2010 used imagery data to infer individual zones of repulsion alignment attraction to describe self aggregation in surf scoter flocks in addition to individual based models other common modelling approaches for herd formation involve the use of mathematical equations of motion for individuals or populations for example lagrangian equations of motion describe individuals trajectories in terms of forces and velocities eulerian continuum equations i e partial differential equations based on a diffusion approximation of random motion are also widely employed to describe the evolution in time and space of mean field density for swarms parrish and edelstein keshet 1999 the key problem with mean field models is that they consider only the first spatial moment the average density of individuals and invoke an assumption that all individuals interact in proportion to this average density i e equivalent to assuming a well mixed population or that all interactions are long ranged thereby ignoring any spatial structure in a population this can give misleading results for systems where spatial structure is an important driver of the population dynamics law et al 2003 models for the dynamics of spatial moments deal explicitly with local spatial structure and avoid the limitations of mean field models by using higher order spatial moments the second spatial moment i e the density of pairs of individuals as a function of their spatial separation carries information on local spatial structure and there is now a substantial body of theory for spatial moment dynamics up to second order for birth death movement processes bolker and pacala 1997 dieckmann and law 2000 murrell and law 2003 this theory has been extended to consider multiple interacting species plank and law 2015 for example in predator prey systems murrell 2005 barraquand and murrell 2013 a formal mathematical derivation that allows construction of a dynamical system for the second spatial moment in the presence of directionally biased movement has been given by middleton et al 2014 binny et al 2015 2016a and extended to include birth and death processes binny et al 2016b this mechanism for neighbour dependent directional bias has been shown to be a strong driver of spatial structure such as aggregation in motile cell populations binny 2016 the directionally biased movement modelling framework has been extended to multiple species by surendran et al 2018b in the context of cell obstacle interactions and by surendran et al 2018a to chase escape dynamics however directional movement of animals as they respond to cues from their neighbourhoods have not previously been part of this framework but see murrell and law 2000 for nondirectional environment dependent movement spatial moment dynamics are capable of providing mechanistic understanding of the effects of individual interactions that repeated simulations of individual based models alone cannot although it is not typically possible to obtain closed form solutions for the spatial moments which must be approximated numerically the structure of the equations can provide analytical insights into the relationships between model parameters and solutions for example spatial moment approximations have revealed how and why spatial structure affects population carrying capacity law et al 2003 new mechanisms for coexistence murrell and law 2003 the relative importance of different drivers of spatial structure binny et al 2016b and an analytical equivalence between mean population density and interaction range binny 2016 although straightforward to simulate in principle individual based models are stochastic processes with a very high dimensional state space and are not amenable to analytical approaches except in special cases blath et al 2007 in addition although individual based models are relatively efficient to simulate for small populations the computational cost for models with interactions among individuals increases faster than linearly with population size binny et al 2016b in contrast the computational cost of solving a spatial moment dynamics approximation is insensitive to population size surendran et al 2018b so this represents an efficient alternative to individual based models for large or growing populations the purpose of this paper is twofold first we employ new mathematical theory recently developed in the context of collective cell behaviour that allows scaling up from directionally biased agent movements to macroscopic dynamics binny et al 2016a surendran et al 2018b and demonstrate how it can be applied in the ecological setting of herd formation in animals the key mathematical expressions encoded in the rules of the individual based model become clear in doing this secondly we show that the spatial properties of herd formation are captured by the macroscopic dynamics through appropriate choice of interaction kernels for directionally biased movement this provides a foundation to bring biased movement into the earlier models of spatial moment dynamics that focus on births deaths and unbiased movement plank and law 2015 the framework will enable herd development to be studied in the broader context of population and community dynamics to facilitate this future work the mathematical derivations are given in a multi species setting 2 stochastic individual based model spatial moment dynamics of birth death and growth processes have been dealt with previously bolker and pacala 1997 dieckmann and law 2000 murrell and law 2003 adams et al 2013 therefore here we consider only movement of individuals of fixed types we first consider an individual based model for motile agents for generality we allow individuals to be of an arbitrary number of types indexed i 1 i max these could be species allowing for instance spatial interactions of predators and herd living prey the indexing can be ignored if all individuals are of the same type processes take place in a continuous two dimensional space which is large compared with the scale over which individuals interact and move a point in the space is given by the vector x x 1 x 2 of cartesian coordinates 2 1 model for biased movement the population comprises a fixed number n of individuals numbered p 1 n and the state at time t is characterised by their types and locations i p x p individual p moves in a series of discrete steps which occur at a rate m p that may depend on its neighbourhood this is a poisson process over time so the probability of movement in a short period δt is m p δt o δt 2 movement events are assumed to occur as instantaneous jumps i e a position jump process as soon as a movement takes place the state of the system is changed potentially leading to a change in m p as well we allow both an intrinsic and a neighbourhood contribution to the movement rate given by 1 m p m i p q p w i p i q x p x q here m i is the intrinsic component of the movement rate for type i and w i p i q x p x q is an extra contribution to the movement rate caused by a neighbouring individual q of type i q at location x q the contribution may depend on the location and type of both p and q the weight typically attenuates with distance from p to q and could depend on whether individual q is the same species or say a predator species the overall effect of neighbours is obtained by summing overall q excluding individual p itself when individual p moves from x p it jumps to another location u p x p ξ where ξ is a random variable in ℝ 2 with a bivariate probability density function pdf of the form 2 μ ˆ p ξ f i p ξ g ˆ p arg ξ where arg ξ 0 2π denotes the direction of the vector ξ the pdf in eq 2 is separated into two independent parts for the distance moved ξ and the direction of movement arg ξ for simplicity we assume that f i ξ is neighbourhood independent though it may depend on the individual s type i and given by the gaussian function with mode r i and variance s i 2 3 f i ξ c i e ξ r i 2 2 s i 2 0 ξ r i max where c i is a normalisation constant in contrast to the distance moved the direction of movement does depend on the neighbourhood of individual p and is the core mechanism underpinning herd development here the neighbourhood dependence takes the form of a bias vector η ˆ p for individual p defined below that provides the parameters for a circular probability distribution for the direction of movement the bias vector is obtained from the gradient vector of a bias kernel function that carries the key biological information as an example we describe the construction of a bias vector for a single focal individual located at the origin in fig 1 this starts with a bias kernel function v i p i q x q x p here a standard gaussian function of the distance x q x p between two individuals fig 1a potentially dependent on both the focal individual s type i p and the neighbouring individual s type i q the kernel gives a gradient vector v i p i q x q x p i e the partial derivatives of v i p i q in the two spatial dimensions fig 1b and c the contribution of neighbouring individual q of type i q and location x q to the bias vector of the focal individual p is the gradient vector evaluated at x q x p light arrows on neighbouring individuals in fig 1d a neighbour vector that points towards the origin corresponds to a repulsive effect of the neighbour on the focal individual an outward arrow would be an attractive effect summing all neighbour vectors gives the bias vector for the focal individual bold arrow on the focal individual in fig 1d 4 η ˆ p β i p q p v i p i q x q x p where β i p is a parameter scaling the overall strength of bias in the example fig 1d the neighbourhood gives the focal individual a preferred direction of movement away from the cluster of individuals on its upper right hand side note that changing the sign of the bias kernel in fig 1a would reverse the direction of all arrows in fig 1d and hence produce an attractive rather than a repulsive bias once the bias vector η ˆ p for individual p is computed its direction of movement θ is drawn from the von mises distribution independent of the distance moved with preferred direction arg η ˆ p and concentration η ˆ p this distribution has probability density function 5 g ˆ p θ g θ η ˆ p exp η ˆ p cos θ arg η ˆ p 2 π i 0 η ˆ p where i 0 is the modified bessel function of the first kind and zero order if the magnitude of the bias vector is large the von mises distribution is tightly peaked around arg η ˆ p meaning the individual is highly likely to move in a direction close to the preferred direction fig 1e this situation would arise if the focal individual has multiple near neighbours exerting bias in similar directions as in the example in fig 1d conversely if the magnitude of the bias vector is small the von mises distribution is more broadly distributed fig 1f in the limit where the bias vector has zero magnitude the von mises distribution is a uniform distribution on 0 2π meaning the focal individual is equally likely to move in any direction this situation would arise if the focal individual has no near neighbours or has neighbours that are symmetrically positioned on opposite sides such that their contributions to the bias vector cancel one another out 2 2 implementation we initialised realisations of the stochastic individual based process with a fixed population of n 200 individuals of a single type the individuals were distributed in a unit arena as a spatial poisson process at the start of each realisation in other words each individual s location was chosen uniformly at random and independently of all other individuals distances are given relative to the unit of the arena we used periodic boundary conditions and updated the state of the system in continuous time using the gillespie algorithm gillespie 1977 for simplicity we assumed the movement rate to be independent of neighbourhood by setting w i p i q 0 for all p and q in eq 1 leaving in place only an effect of neighbours on the direction of intrinsic movements eqs 2 5 define the bivariate movement distribution of a focal individual p vectors ξ from this bivariate distribution were obtained by independently generating the distance and direction of movement the probability that the distance moved ξ by an individual of type i lies in the infinitesimal interval r r dr is rf i r dr hence movement distance of an individual of type i has pdf h i r r f i r random numbers from this distribution were generated via the following rejection sampling algorithm 1 generate a normally distributed random number r n r i s i 2 2 if r lies outside the interval 0 r i max go to step 1 this results in a sample from the distribution with pdf f i r specified by eq 3 3 accept r with probability p r r r i max otherwise go to step 1 this results in a sample from the distribution with pdf h i r as required the direction of movement θ was generated from the von mises distribution with pdf given by eq 5 this requires the bias vector η ˆ p for individual p to be calculated according to eq 4 2 3 biased movement kernels and spatial structure the choice of a kernel for biased movement is a biological matter with far reaching consequences fig 2 gives three examples the first is a single gaussian function centred on the origin 6 a v i p i q r 1 n e r 2 2 σ 1 2 where r x q x p is the distance of neighbour q from focal individual p σ 1 is a measure of the width of the function and n is a normalisation constant the second and third examples combine a gaussian function centred on the origin with one offset from the origin by an amount r and with width σ 2 7 v i p i q r 1 n e r 2 2 σ 1 2 k 2 e r r 2 2 σ 2 2 the weight k 2 of the outer function having different signs b k 2 0 and c k 2 0 a kernel based on the single gaussian function generates a gradient vector that points towards the origin creating a region of repulsion around each individual this means that individuals tend to move away from near neighbours fig 2a leading to territory formation fig 2d a kernel based on a double gaussian function in which the outer gaussian is positive k 2 0 fig 2b generates three concentric rings an inner ring where the gradient vector points towards the origin an intermediate ring where it points away from the origin and an outer ring where it points towards the origin this creates short range repulsion medium range attraction and long range repulsion leading individuals to form small clusters fig 2e a kernel based on a double gaussian function in which the outer gaussian is negative k 2 0 fig 2c generates two concentric rings an inner ring where the gradient vector points towards the origin and an outer ring where it points away from the origin this creates short range repulsion and long range attraction leading towards coalescence of the population into a single mega herd fig 2f the reverse order attraction repulsion would lead to collapse of individuals within groups to a single point which would not be not biologically reasonable short range repulsion fig 2a and d creates space around individuals and is a natural basis for territories defended by individuals or groups that come about from scarcity of resources maher and lott 1995 adding longer range attraction fig 2c and f allows for benefits of living in groups such as a reduced risk of predation increased chance of detecting predators and less need for individual vigilance hamilton 1971 pulliam 1973 elgar 1989 with the short range repulsion still in place some space around individuals remains and this can lead to remarkable spatial structure such as that observed in king penguin colonies gerum et al 2018 however the combination of local repulsion and longer range attraction can lead to very large groups forming olson et al 2009 in practice populations often break up into much smaller groups because of the costs of living together such as the need for synchronised behaviour gajamannage et al 2017 levels of stress markham et al 2015 possibly the spread of disease griffin and nunn 2012 sah et al 2017 and competition cooperation between males duval 2007 adding a further outer region of repulsion fig 2b and e allows break ups to happen the smaller groups being distributed non randomly over space with spatial structure inside the groups themselves the spatial structures in fig 2 are clearly quite different and this difference is summarised in their pair correlation functions fig 2g i a pair correlation function ρ ij r is a standard second order spatial statistic based on the density of pairs of points of type i j as a function of the distance r between them illian et al 2008 in the absence of spatial structure at a distance r ρ ij r takes a value 1 if there is an excess of pairs clustering ρ ij r 1 if there is a lack of pairs regular pattern ρ ij r 1 thus the space that individuals create around themselves in fig 2d shows up as a lack of pairs at short distance in the pair correlation in fig 2g the clusters that form in fig 2e appear as an excess of pairs at short distances in fig 2h and a lack of pairs at slightly longer distances the clusters themselves are not distributed at random across space and leave an attenuating oscillatory signal in the pair correlation as distance increases the location of the secondary peak in fig 2h at around r 0 2 corresponds to the typical distance between adjacent clusters the mega herd developing in fig 2f appears as a large peak of pairs at short distances from the interaction of local repulsion and longer distance attraction with pairs becoming less frequent beyond the peak fig 2i the function does not tend to 1 at large distances because the cluster is on the same spatial scale as the arena at a single point in time repeated realisations of the stochastic processes from the same initial statistical distribution have different spatial configurations but the same basic information is retained in the pair correlation functions as time goes on the spatial patterns change and the pair correlation functions track the developing spatial structure this tracking is evident in fig 2g i the realisations all started as poisson processes lacking spatial structure and with pair correlation functions close to 1 at all distances but by t 10 the functions are quite distinct from one another as shown in fig 2 the significance of the time dependent pair correlation becomes important below because a measure of this kind becomes the state variable of the spatial moment dynamics in some ecological systems statistical stationarity may eventually be reached but in others such as predator prey systems it is conceivable that the pair correlation functions could develop periodic behaviour and continue to change indefinitely the long term behaviour of the pair correlation function under a given choice of bias kernel is not sensitive to the particular choice of initial conditions 3 spatial moment dynamics here we show how the algorithmic rules of the individual based stochastic process can be described mathematically to give deterministic approximation in the form of a dynamical system for the second spatial moment 3 1 definition of spatial moments in defining the spatial moments it helps to think of small regions of area h so that the o h 2 probability of containing more than one individual is vanishingly small formally the first spatial moment at time t is the expected value of the density obtained from the stochastic process at time t in the limit as h 0 8 z 1 i x lim h 0 e n i δ x h where n i δx is the number of individuals of type i in the region δx centred on x in the case of the second moment we consider two regions of area h δx centred on x containing n i individuals of type i and δy centred on y containing n j individuals of type j the second spatial moment at time t is the expected value of the pair density from the stochastic process at time t in the limit as h 0 plank and law 2015 9 z 2 ij x y lim h 0 e n i δ x n j δ y δ ij n i δ x δ y h 2 the second term in the numerator with kronecker delta δ ij is needed to remove a pair that i in δx would otherwise create with itself below we also use the third moment the density of triplets z 3 ijk x y z defined in a similar way after removing all non distinct triplets plank and law 2015 3 2 dynamics of the second moment for simplicity we consider dynamics in a homogeneous space meaning that the statistics of the spatial point process in any subdomain are the same regardless of the location of that subdomain in this case the first spatial moment z 1 i is independent of spatial location x further since the model consists only of movement and there is no birth or death there is no change in first moment over time so the first moment is simply a constant determined by the fixed population size the second spatial moment z 2 ij can be expressed as a function of the displacement vector between two individuals ξ y x rather than as a function of their physical locations x and y see fig 3 for geometric interpretation similarly the third moment z 3 ijk can be expressed in terms of two displacement vectors ξ y x and ξ z x although the first moment is constant the second moment does change over time as spatial structure develops as was evident from the pair correlation functions in fig 2 the second moment and all higher moments are functions of time but for clarity we omit the time argument below the normalised second moment z 2 ij ξ z 1 i z 1 j relates to the measure of spatial structure in fig 2g i it is the expected value of the pair correlation function ρ ij r under isotropy thus to follow the dynamics of the second moment is equivalent to following the behaviour of the average pair correlation function over time in other words the dynamics track the development of spatial structure over time with z 2 ij ξ as the state variable we have a dynamical system describing changes in a function as opposed to a dynamical system of a scalar quantity the density of individuals i e we have a partial as opposed to an ordinary differential equation this is to be expected because the dynamical system has to carry information about the location of individuals relative to one another a formal derivation from the stochastic process binny et al 2015 2016a leads to six terms affecting the rate of change in the second moment z 2 ij ξ due to movement by the focal individual of type i labelled a f below and with geometries illustrated in fig 3 symmetric terms corresponding to movement of the other individual of type j in the pair are obtained by making the transformation i j ξ j i ξ to each of the terms below first are three negative terms that account for the ways in which an existing pair consisting of an individual of type i separated from an individual of type j by a vector ξ can be destroyed bias in the movement direction does not enter into these terms because movement by the focal individual in any direction destroys the pair a intrinsic rate of movement m i of the focal individual 10 f a z 2 ij ξ m i b effect of the neighbourhood of the focal individual on its movement rate 11 f b k z 3 ijk ξ ξ w ik ξ d ξ this incorporates the density of neighbours of type k displaced by ξ from the focal individual conditional on the presence of the individual of type j displaced by ξ from the focal individual given by the third moment z 3 ijk ξ ξ the kernel function w ik ξ gives a weight to the effect of the neighbour on the movement rate of the focal individual the overall effect of the neighbourhood is then obtained by integrating over all displacements ξ and summing over all types k c the other individual of type j in the pair also affects the movement rate of the focal individual with a contribution weighted by w ij ξ 12 f c z 2 ij ξ w ij ξ mirroring the negative terms are three positive terms that account for the ways in which a pair consisting of an individual of type i separated from an individual of type j by a vector ξ can be created since this can only occur via movement this always starts with an ij pair separated by a different vector denoted ξ ξ followed by a movement by vector ξ these terms are more intricate than those in eqs 10 12 because they have to cover all possible starting locations for the focal individual and this needs to allow for bias in movement direction d intrinsic movement rate of the focal individual allowing for all starting points 13 f d m i z 2 ij ξ ξ μ ij ξ ξ ξ d ξ here the term inside the integral is the probability of starting with an ij pair separated by vector ξ ξ followed by a movement by ξ of the individual of type i which happens with probability density μ ij ξ ξ ξ see below this is then integrated over ξ to allow for all possible starting locations e effect of the neighbourhood of the focal individual on its movement rate depending on its starting location 14 f e μ ij ξ ξ ξ k z 3 ijk ξ ξ ξ w ik ξ d ξ d ξ this is similar in structure to 11 accounting for the influence on the focal individual s movement rate of a third individual of type k at displacement ξ the outer integral over ξ allows for all possible starting locations for the focal individual f the other individual of type j in the pair also affects the movement rate of the focal individual 15 f f z 2 ij ξ ξ μ ij ξ ξ ξ w ij ξ ξ d ξ this is similar in structure to 13 but instead of the intrinsic movement rate m i accounts for the contribution to the focal individual s movement rate from the other individual of type j in the pair when the pair is initially separated by vector ξ ξ this contribution is w ij ξ ξ again the integral over ξ allows for all possible starting locations the key ecological information for movement bias is contained in μ ij ξ ξ ξ which is the probability density that the focal individual s movement vector is ξ conditional on the presence of an individual of type j located at ξ ξ relative to the focal individual this is the movement vector needed to create the ij pair separated by ξ as required as with the stochastic model eq 2 this is composed of two independent parts 16 μ ij ξ ξ ξ f i ξ g arg ξ η ij ξ ξ the first part f i ξ relates to the distance moved by an individual of type i which is independent of the neighbourhood and given by eq 3 the second part g arg ξ η ij ξ ξ is the probability density of moving in direction arg ξ which does depend on the neighbourhood this dependence is encapsulated in the expected bias vector η ij ξ ξ for an individual of type i separated from an individual of type j by a vector ξ ξ 17 η ij ξ ξ β i k v ik ξ z 3 ijk ξ ξ ξ z 2 ij ξ ξ d ξ v ij ξ ξ here v ik ξ is the gradient vector of the bias kernel v ik ξ eq 17 integrates over the neighbourhood of the focal individual for neighbouring individuals of type k then sums over all types k and adds the effect of the partner individual of type j in the pair the parameter β i gives an overall weight for the bias the bias vector provides the parameters for a circular probability distribution to match the stochastic model we use a von mises distribution with peak angle arg η ij and concentration η ij to obtain the probability density function of the angle arg ξ summing expressions 10 15 gives the total rate of change of the pair density z 2 ij ξ 18 t z 2 ij ξ t f a ξ t f f ξ t i j ξ j i ξ where the matching symmetric terms for the partner individual in the ij pair are given by the substitutions i j ξ j i ξ plank and law 2015 we give the function arguments in full to make clear the time dependence this is a formal exact description of how the movement rules at the level of the individual translate into a dynamical system of pair densities at the macroscopic level after averaging over many realisations of the stochastic process starting from the same statistical distribution 3 3 closure of the second moment dynamics the dynamical system is not yet closed because it contains the third spatial moment the density of triplets to deal with this a closure approximation is needed to replace the third moment by a function of lower order moments although not usually recognised closures are ubiquitous in ecological theory ignoring spatial structure completely implies a closure of the form z 2 ij ξ z 1 i z 1 j giving a dynamical system for the first moment average density i e the law of mass action or the so called mean field assumption a formal theory of closures at second order is a matter for research raghib et al 2011 dieckmann and law 2000 murrell et al 2004 here we use the kirkwood closure kirkwood 1935 19 z 3 ijk ξ ξ z 2 ij ξ z 2 ik ξ z 2 jk ξ ξ z 1 i z 1 j z 1 k as we have found the exact choice of closure makes little difference when the dynamics deal only with movement i e without birth and death see for example fig 6 3 in binny 2016 3 4 spatial moment dynamics as an approximation scheme after closure the dynamical system is no more than an approximation for the expected value of the second moment of the stochastic process because it ignores spatial information carried by higher order moments how well does this approximation work this is analogous to asking how well the mean field assumption works as a description of population dynamics the answer to that question is that the approximation is poor if neighbourhoods are important raghib et al 2011 the second order closure should be better because it does carry spatial information but would still be expected to become poor as higher order spatial structure becomes important fig 4 compares the spatial signal of the spatial moment dynamics with that of the stochastic individual based model from which the dynamical system 18 19 was derived for comparability with the stochastic results we assumed the movement rate to be independent of neighbourhood by setting w ij 0 in eqs 10 15 and leaving in place only an effect of neighbours on the direction of intrinsic movements this means that the spatial moment dynamics deal only with terms 10 13 geometries a and d in fig 3 we examined the dynamics for the bias kernels shown in fig 2a and b as these generate structure at a small spatial scale we would not expect to find a good approximation with the bias kernel in fig 2c because spatial structure remains at large spatial scales in other words the pair correlation ρ r does not approach 1 as r increases in fig 2i fig 4 shows that the approximation scheme captures some basic signals of the stochastic individual based model fig 4 shows the characteristic regular structure arising from repulsive bias manifested as a lack of pairs at short distance fig 4 shows the distinct cluster formation as a result of short range repulsion medium range attraction and long range repulsion although the quantitative match between the stochastic results and the spatial moments approximation is far from perfect the key qualitative features of the emergent spatial structure are captured in the second moment this illustrates two key points first it shows that the rules responsible for generating the spatial structure in the stochastic model are encapsulated by the dynamical system of spatial moments despite the latter appearing to be completely different second it demonstrates that much of the information about spatial structure is carried just in the second spatial moment in other words there is some justification for closing the hierarchy at second order the information shown in fig 4 would be lost completely in a mean field model which implicitly closes the system at the level of the first moment 4 discussion this work draws on recent advances in spatial moment dynamics models of collective cell behaviour binny et al 2016a surendran et al 2018b to address the issue of animal herding behaviour in ecology and opens new research avenues in this setting in particular we have explored how using different forms of neighbourhood interaction kernels for directionally biased movement can give rise to formation of animal groups or herds individual based models describing biased directional movement have been widely used in an ecological context codling and hill 2005 benhamou 2006 codling et al 2007 bode 2011 however this is the first time that a spatial moment dynamics model capturing the outcomes of this directional bias at the macroscopic scale has been used to describe animals living in groups in doing this we have shown the geometry of six flux terms that describe the exact relationship between the algorithmic individual based model and the mathematical model up to the second spatial moment our results show that herd like spatial structure can be generated solely from interactions among neighbouring individuals of the same species in reality this spatial structure can be strongly affected by interspecific interactions such as the presence of predators future work will include explicitly applying the model framework developed here to systems with multiple interacting species this has been done for cell obstacle interactions surendran et al 2018b and chase escape interactions surendran et al 2018a but these models use simple attractive or repulsive interactions rather than the distance dependent interactions that we employ here one advantage of spatial moment approximations over individual based models is that the equations for the dynamics of spatial moments are deterministic and only need to be solved once rather than performing computationally intensive repeated simulations they are also more tractable mathematically permitting further analysis and exploration of parameter space computational power typically restricts simulation of individual based models to systems with relatively low numbers of individuals due to the requirements of tracking each individual s movements and interactions with each of its neighbours over time there are many such examples of small herd systems in ecology see for example table 1 in reiczigel et al 2008 in contrast the computational requirement for solving the spatial moments approximation is independent of population size the methodology would lend itself to systems with much larger animal herds and offer insights that would otherwise require considerably greater computational resources to achieve through simulations alone although the spatial moment model shows the basic spatial structure its fit to the stochastic model could clearly be improved attenuation of the spatial signal with increasing distance is rather slow in fig 4b which generates inaccuracies that can propagate to shorter distances also at the shortest distances the model overestimates the strength of spatial structure this may be because after discretisation spatial resolution becomes less good as r 0 such issues could be dealt with by discretising over a larger space on a finer spatial grid but this would have made computation unfeasible in future work a fourier transform for the convolution integrals should be considered as this could provide a major increase in speed of computation previous models for animals living in herds have used the idea of zones of attraction and repulsion couzin et al 2002 bode 2011 a zone of repulsion is also supported by data krause et al 2002 zones of repulsion and attraction have also been modelled in the cell behaviour literature for example using the lennard jones kernel jeon et al 2010 and the morse potential middleton et al 2014 matsiaka et al 2017 our model incorporates and builds on these ideas including the possibility for multiple zones of attraction and repulsion with different spatial scales examples of the types of behaviour encapsulated by the bias kernels we have studied and the resulting spatial structure can be found in real animal populations for example gerum et al 2018

24945,herd formation in animal populations for example to escape a predator or coordinate feeding is a widespread phenomenon understanding which interactions between individual animals are important for generating such emergent self organisation has been a key focus of ecological and mathematical research here we show the relationship between the algorithmic rules of herd forming agents and the mathematical structure of the corresponding spatial moment dynamics this entails scaling up from the rules of individual herd generating behaviour to the macroscopic dynamics of herd structure the model employs a mechanism for neighbour dependent directionally biased movement to explore how individual interactions generate aggregation and repulsion in groups of animals our results show that a combination of mutually attractive and repulsive interactions with different spatial scales is sufficient to lead to the stable formation of groups with a characteristic size keywords collective behaviour herd formation moment closure approximation neighbourhood interactions spatial point process 1 introduction the self organisation of animals into herds and the use of individual based models to learn about the rules underlying this process is a core subject in behavioural ecology krause et al 2002 herd formation is most often considered in terms of movements of individuals biased by their interactions at small spatial scales however these movements can affect the dynamics of populations and communities at larger spatial scales in his seminal work geometry for the selfish herd hamilton 1971 proposed that aggregation of animals into groups or herds could be driven by the selfish desire of an animal to reduce its predation risk by manoeuvring to positions that would place other population members closer to the predator underlying this idea was the concept of an animal s domain of danger a region of space containing all points nearer to that individual than to any other individual the larger an animal s domain of danger the greater its risk of predation and hamilton therefore theorised that aggregation arose simply due to each animal undergoing movements towards its nearest neighbour to reduce the size of its domain of danger stemming from this original idea james et al 2004 considered a model with greater biological realism by incorporating a limited domain of danger representing either a limited detection range or attack range of predators that could be applied to animal groups of finite size further work by reluga and viscido 2005 pointed out that rules for generating realistic selfish herds need interactions beyond an individual s nearest neighbours and showed how predation based selection could increase the influence of distant neighbours other models explored animal aggregation behaviour by introducing sensory zones of individuals for example zones of repulsion or attraction that drive animals towards or away from neighbouring individuals giving rise to higher order structure in the population couzin et al 2002 wood and ackland 2007 bode 2011 herbert read et al 2011 one such model proposed by lukeman et al 2010 used imagery data to infer individual zones of repulsion alignment attraction to describe self aggregation in surf scoter flocks in addition to individual based models other common modelling approaches for herd formation involve the use of mathematical equations of motion for individuals or populations for example lagrangian equations of motion describe individuals trajectories in terms of forces and velocities eulerian continuum equations i e partial differential equations based on a diffusion approximation of random motion are also widely employed to describe the evolution in time and space of mean field density for swarms parrish and edelstein keshet 1999 the key problem with mean field models is that they consider only the first spatial moment the average density of individuals and invoke an assumption that all individuals interact in proportion to this average density i e equivalent to assuming a well mixed population or that all interactions are long ranged thereby ignoring any spatial structure in a population this can give misleading results for systems where spatial structure is an important driver of the population dynamics law et al 2003 models for the dynamics of spatial moments deal explicitly with local spatial structure and avoid the limitations of mean field models by using higher order spatial moments the second spatial moment i e the density of pairs of individuals as a function of their spatial separation carries information on local spatial structure and there is now a substantial body of theory for spatial moment dynamics up to second order for birth death movement processes bolker and pacala 1997 dieckmann and law 2000 murrell and law 2003 this theory has been extended to consider multiple interacting species plank and law 2015 for example in predator prey systems murrell 2005 barraquand and murrell 2013 a formal mathematical derivation that allows construction of a dynamical system for the second spatial moment in the presence of directionally biased movement has been given by middleton et al 2014 binny et al 2015 2016a and extended to include birth and death processes binny et al 2016b this mechanism for neighbour dependent directional bias has been shown to be a strong driver of spatial structure such as aggregation in motile cell populations binny 2016 the directionally biased movement modelling framework has been extended to multiple species by surendran et al 2018b in the context of cell obstacle interactions and by surendran et al 2018a to chase escape dynamics however directional movement of animals as they respond to cues from their neighbourhoods have not previously been part of this framework but see murrell and law 2000 for nondirectional environment dependent movement spatial moment dynamics are capable of providing mechanistic understanding of the effects of individual interactions that repeated simulations of individual based models alone cannot although it is not typically possible to obtain closed form solutions for the spatial moments which must be approximated numerically the structure of the equations can provide analytical insights into the relationships between model parameters and solutions for example spatial moment approximations have revealed how and why spatial structure affects population carrying capacity law et al 2003 new mechanisms for coexistence murrell and law 2003 the relative importance of different drivers of spatial structure binny et al 2016b and an analytical equivalence between mean population density and interaction range binny 2016 although straightforward to simulate in principle individual based models are stochastic processes with a very high dimensional state space and are not amenable to analytical approaches except in special cases blath et al 2007 in addition although individual based models are relatively efficient to simulate for small populations the computational cost for models with interactions among individuals increases faster than linearly with population size binny et al 2016b in contrast the computational cost of solving a spatial moment dynamics approximation is insensitive to population size surendran et al 2018b so this represents an efficient alternative to individual based models for large or growing populations the purpose of this paper is twofold first we employ new mathematical theory recently developed in the context of collective cell behaviour that allows scaling up from directionally biased agent movements to macroscopic dynamics binny et al 2016a surendran et al 2018b and demonstrate how it can be applied in the ecological setting of herd formation in animals the key mathematical expressions encoded in the rules of the individual based model become clear in doing this secondly we show that the spatial properties of herd formation are captured by the macroscopic dynamics through appropriate choice of interaction kernels for directionally biased movement this provides a foundation to bring biased movement into the earlier models of spatial moment dynamics that focus on births deaths and unbiased movement plank and law 2015 the framework will enable herd development to be studied in the broader context of population and community dynamics to facilitate this future work the mathematical derivations are given in a multi species setting 2 stochastic individual based model spatial moment dynamics of birth death and growth processes have been dealt with previously bolker and pacala 1997 dieckmann and law 2000 murrell and law 2003 adams et al 2013 therefore here we consider only movement of individuals of fixed types we first consider an individual based model for motile agents for generality we allow individuals to be of an arbitrary number of types indexed i 1 i max these could be species allowing for instance spatial interactions of predators and herd living prey the indexing can be ignored if all individuals are of the same type processes take place in a continuous two dimensional space which is large compared with the scale over which individuals interact and move a point in the space is given by the vector x x 1 x 2 of cartesian coordinates 2 1 model for biased movement the population comprises a fixed number n of individuals numbered p 1 n and the state at time t is characterised by their types and locations i p x p individual p moves in a series of discrete steps which occur at a rate m p that may depend on its neighbourhood this is a poisson process over time so the probability of movement in a short period δt is m p δt o δt 2 movement events are assumed to occur as instantaneous jumps i e a position jump process as soon as a movement takes place the state of the system is changed potentially leading to a change in m p as well we allow both an intrinsic and a neighbourhood contribution to the movement rate given by 1 m p m i p q p w i p i q x p x q here m i is the intrinsic component of the movement rate for type i and w i p i q x p x q is an extra contribution to the movement rate caused by a neighbouring individual q of type i q at location x q the contribution may depend on the location and type of both p and q the weight typically attenuates with distance from p to q and could depend on whether individual q is the same species or say a predator species the overall effect of neighbours is obtained by summing overall q excluding individual p itself when individual p moves from x p it jumps to another location u p x p ξ where ξ is a random variable in ℝ 2 with a bivariate probability density function pdf of the form 2 μ ˆ p ξ f i p ξ g ˆ p arg ξ where arg ξ 0 2π denotes the direction of the vector ξ the pdf in eq 2 is separated into two independent parts for the distance moved ξ and the direction of movement arg ξ for simplicity we assume that f i ξ is neighbourhood independent though it may depend on the individual s type i and given by the gaussian function with mode r i and variance s i 2 3 f i ξ c i e ξ r i 2 2 s i 2 0 ξ r i max where c i is a normalisation constant in contrast to the distance moved the direction of movement does depend on the neighbourhood of individual p and is the core mechanism underpinning herd development here the neighbourhood dependence takes the form of a bias vector η ˆ p for individual p defined below that provides the parameters for a circular probability distribution for the direction of movement the bias vector is obtained from the gradient vector of a bias kernel function that carries the key biological information as an example we describe the construction of a bias vector for a single focal individual located at the origin in fig 1 this starts with a bias kernel function v i p i q x q x p here a standard gaussian function of the distance x q x p between two individuals fig 1a potentially dependent on both the focal individual s type i p and the neighbouring individual s type i q the kernel gives a gradient vector v i p i q x q x p i e the partial derivatives of v i p i q in the two spatial dimensions fig 1b and c the contribution of neighbouring individual q of type i q and location x q to the bias vector of the focal individual p is the gradient vector evaluated at x q x p light arrows on neighbouring individuals in fig 1d a neighbour vector that points towards the origin corresponds to a repulsive effect of the neighbour on the focal individual an outward arrow would be an attractive effect summing all neighbour vectors gives the bias vector for the focal individual bold arrow on the focal individual in fig 1d 4 η ˆ p β i p q p v i p i q x q x p where β i p is a parameter scaling the overall strength of bias in the example fig 1d the neighbourhood gives the focal individual a preferred direction of movement away from the cluster of individuals on its upper right hand side note that changing the sign of the bias kernel in fig 1a would reverse the direction of all arrows in fig 1d and hence produce an attractive rather than a repulsive bias once the bias vector η ˆ p for individual p is computed its direction of movement θ is drawn from the von mises distribution independent of the distance moved with preferred direction arg η ˆ p and concentration η ˆ p this distribution has probability density function 5 g ˆ p θ g θ η ˆ p exp η ˆ p cos θ arg η ˆ p 2 π i 0 η ˆ p where i 0 is the modified bessel function of the first kind and zero order if the magnitude of the bias vector is large the von mises distribution is tightly peaked around arg η ˆ p meaning the individual is highly likely to move in a direction close to the preferred direction fig 1e this situation would arise if the focal individual has multiple near neighbours exerting bias in similar directions as in the example in fig 1d conversely if the magnitude of the bias vector is small the von mises distribution is more broadly distributed fig 1f in the limit where the bias vector has zero magnitude the von mises distribution is a uniform distribution on 0 2π meaning the focal individual is equally likely to move in any direction this situation would arise if the focal individual has no near neighbours or has neighbours that are symmetrically positioned on opposite sides such that their contributions to the bias vector cancel one another out 2 2 implementation we initialised realisations of the stochastic individual based process with a fixed population of n 200 individuals of a single type the individuals were distributed in a unit arena as a spatial poisson process at the start of each realisation in other words each individual s location was chosen uniformly at random and independently of all other individuals distances are given relative to the unit of the arena we used periodic boundary conditions and updated the state of the system in continuous time using the gillespie algorithm gillespie 1977 for simplicity we assumed the movement rate to be independent of neighbourhood by setting w i p i q 0 for all p and q in eq 1 leaving in place only an effect of neighbours on the direction of intrinsic movements eqs 2 5 define the bivariate movement distribution of a focal individual p vectors ξ from this bivariate distribution were obtained by independently generating the distance and direction of movement the probability that the distance moved ξ by an individual of type i lies in the infinitesimal interval r r dr is rf i r dr hence movement distance of an individual of type i has pdf h i r r f i r random numbers from this distribution were generated via the following rejection sampling algorithm 1 generate a normally distributed random number r n r i s i 2 2 if r lies outside the interval 0 r i max go to step 1 this results in a sample from the distribution with pdf f i r specified by eq 3 3 accept r with probability p r r r i max otherwise go to step 1 this results in a sample from the distribution with pdf h i r as required the direction of movement θ was generated from the von mises distribution with pdf given by eq 5 this requires the bias vector η ˆ p for individual p to be calculated according to eq 4 2 3 biased movement kernels and spatial structure the choice of a kernel for biased movement is a biological matter with far reaching consequences fig 2 gives three examples the first is a single gaussian function centred on the origin 6 a v i p i q r 1 n e r 2 2 σ 1 2 where r x q x p is the distance of neighbour q from focal individual p σ 1 is a measure of the width of the function and n is a normalisation constant the second and third examples combine a gaussian function centred on the origin with one offset from the origin by an amount r and with width σ 2 7 v i p i q r 1 n e r 2 2 σ 1 2 k 2 e r r 2 2 σ 2 2 the weight k 2 of the outer function having different signs b k 2 0 and c k 2 0 a kernel based on the single gaussian function generates a gradient vector that points towards the origin creating a region of repulsion around each individual this means that individuals tend to move away from near neighbours fig 2a leading to territory formation fig 2d a kernel based on a double gaussian function in which the outer gaussian is positive k 2 0 fig 2b generates three concentric rings an inner ring where the gradient vector points towards the origin an intermediate ring where it points away from the origin and an outer ring where it points towards the origin this creates short range repulsion medium range attraction and long range repulsion leading individuals to form small clusters fig 2e a kernel based on a double gaussian function in which the outer gaussian is negative k 2 0 fig 2c generates two concentric rings an inner ring where the gradient vector points towards the origin and an outer ring where it points away from the origin this creates short range repulsion and long range attraction leading towards coalescence of the population into a single mega herd fig 2f the reverse order attraction repulsion would lead to collapse of individuals within groups to a single point which would not be not biologically reasonable short range repulsion fig 2a and d creates space around individuals and is a natural basis for territories defended by individuals or groups that come about from scarcity of resources maher and lott 1995 adding longer range attraction fig 2c and f allows for benefits of living in groups such as a reduced risk of predation increased chance of detecting predators and less need for individual vigilance hamilton 1971 pulliam 1973 elgar 1989 with the short range repulsion still in place some space around individuals remains and this can lead to remarkable spatial structure such as that observed in king penguin colonies gerum et al 2018 however the combination of local repulsion and longer range attraction can lead to very large groups forming olson et al 2009 in practice populations often break up into much smaller groups because of the costs of living together such as the need for synchronised behaviour gajamannage et al 2017 levels of stress markham et al 2015 possibly the spread of disease griffin and nunn 2012 sah et al 2017 and competition cooperation between males duval 2007 adding a further outer region of repulsion fig 2b and e allows break ups to happen the smaller groups being distributed non randomly over space with spatial structure inside the groups themselves the spatial structures in fig 2 are clearly quite different and this difference is summarised in their pair correlation functions fig 2g i a pair correlation function ρ ij r is a standard second order spatial statistic based on the density of pairs of points of type i j as a function of the distance r between them illian et al 2008 in the absence of spatial structure at a distance r ρ ij r takes a value 1 if there is an excess of pairs clustering ρ ij r 1 if there is a lack of pairs regular pattern ρ ij r 1 thus the space that individuals create around themselves in fig 2d shows up as a lack of pairs at short distance in the pair correlation in fig 2g the clusters that form in fig 2e appear as an excess of pairs at short distances in fig 2h and a lack of pairs at slightly longer distances the clusters themselves are not distributed at random across space and leave an attenuating oscillatory signal in the pair correlation as distance increases the location of the secondary peak in fig 2h at around r 0 2 corresponds to the typical distance between adjacent clusters the mega herd developing in fig 2f appears as a large peak of pairs at short distances from the interaction of local repulsion and longer distance attraction with pairs becoming less frequent beyond the peak fig 2i the function does not tend to 1 at large distances because the cluster is on the same spatial scale as the arena at a single point in time repeated realisations of the stochastic processes from the same initial statistical distribution have different spatial configurations but the same basic information is retained in the pair correlation functions as time goes on the spatial patterns change and the pair correlation functions track the developing spatial structure this tracking is evident in fig 2g i the realisations all started as poisson processes lacking spatial structure and with pair correlation functions close to 1 at all distances but by t 10 the functions are quite distinct from one another as shown in fig 2 the significance of the time dependent pair correlation becomes important below because a measure of this kind becomes the state variable of the spatial moment dynamics in some ecological systems statistical stationarity may eventually be reached but in others such as predator prey systems it is conceivable that the pair correlation functions could develop periodic behaviour and continue to change indefinitely the long term behaviour of the pair correlation function under a given choice of bias kernel is not sensitive to the particular choice of initial conditions 3 spatial moment dynamics here we show how the algorithmic rules of the individual based stochastic process can be described mathematically to give deterministic approximation in the form of a dynamical system for the second spatial moment 3 1 definition of spatial moments in defining the spatial moments it helps to think of small regions of area h so that the o h 2 probability of containing more than one individual is vanishingly small formally the first spatial moment at time t is the expected value of the density obtained from the stochastic process at time t in the limit as h 0 8 z 1 i x lim h 0 e n i δ x h where n i δx is the number of individuals of type i in the region δx centred on x in the case of the second moment we consider two regions of area h δx centred on x containing n i individuals of type i and δy centred on y containing n j individuals of type j the second spatial moment at time t is the expected value of the pair density from the stochastic process at time t in the limit as h 0 plank and law 2015 9 z 2 ij x y lim h 0 e n i δ x n j δ y δ ij n i δ x δ y h 2 the second term in the numerator with kronecker delta δ ij is needed to remove a pair that i in δx would otherwise create with itself below we also use the third moment the density of triplets z 3 ijk x y z defined in a similar way after removing all non distinct triplets plank and law 2015 3 2 dynamics of the second moment for simplicity we consider dynamics in a homogeneous space meaning that the statistics of the spatial point process in any subdomain are the same regardless of the location of that subdomain in this case the first spatial moment z 1 i is independent of spatial location x further since the model consists only of movement and there is no birth or death there is no change in first moment over time so the first moment is simply a constant determined by the fixed population size the second spatial moment z 2 ij can be expressed as a function of the displacement vector between two individuals ξ y x rather than as a function of their physical locations x and y see fig 3 for geometric interpretation similarly the third moment z 3 ijk can be expressed in terms of two displacement vectors ξ y x and ξ z x although the first moment is constant the second moment does change over time as spatial structure develops as was evident from the pair correlation functions in fig 2 the second moment and all higher moments are functions of time but for clarity we omit the time argument below the normalised second moment z 2 ij ξ z 1 i z 1 j relates to the measure of spatial structure in fig 2g i it is the expected value of the pair correlation function ρ ij r under isotropy thus to follow the dynamics of the second moment is equivalent to following the behaviour of the average pair correlation function over time in other words the dynamics track the development of spatial structure over time with z 2 ij ξ as the state variable we have a dynamical system describing changes in a function as opposed to a dynamical system of a scalar quantity the density of individuals i e we have a partial as opposed to an ordinary differential equation this is to be expected because the dynamical system has to carry information about the location of individuals relative to one another a formal derivation from the stochastic process binny et al 2015 2016a leads to six terms affecting the rate of change in the second moment z 2 ij ξ due to movement by the focal individual of type i labelled a f below and with geometries illustrated in fig 3 symmetric terms corresponding to movement of the other individual of type j in the pair are obtained by making the transformation i j ξ j i ξ to each of the terms below first are three negative terms that account for the ways in which an existing pair consisting of an individual of type i separated from an individual of type j by a vector ξ can be destroyed bias in the movement direction does not enter into these terms because movement by the focal individual in any direction destroys the pair a intrinsic rate of movement m i of the focal individual 10 f a z 2 ij ξ m i b effect of the neighbourhood of the focal individual on its movement rate 11 f b k z 3 ijk ξ ξ w ik ξ d ξ this incorporates the density of neighbours of type k displaced by ξ from the focal individual conditional on the presence of the individual of type j displaced by ξ from the focal individual given by the third moment z 3 ijk ξ ξ the kernel function w ik ξ gives a weight to the effect of the neighbour on the movement rate of the focal individual the overall effect of the neighbourhood is then obtained by integrating over all displacements ξ and summing over all types k c the other individual of type j in the pair also affects the movement rate of the focal individual with a contribution weighted by w ij ξ 12 f c z 2 ij ξ w ij ξ mirroring the negative terms are three positive terms that account for the ways in which a pair consisting of an individual of type i separated from an individual of type j by a vector ξ can be created since this can only occur via movement this always starts with an ij pair separated by a different vector denoted ξ ξ followed by a movement by vector ξ these terms are more intricate than those in eqs 10 12 because they have to cover all possible starting locations for the focal individual and this needs to allow for bias in movement direction d intrinsic movement rate of the focal individual allowing for all starting points 13 f d m i z 2 ij ξ ξ μ ij ξ ξ ξ d ξ here the term inside the integral is the probability of starting with an ij pair separated by vector ξ ξ followed by a movement by ξ of the individual of type i which happens with probability density μ ij ξ ξ ξ see below this is then integrated over ξ to allow for all possible starting locations e effect of the neighbourhood of the focal individual on its movement rate depending on its starting location 14 f e μ ij ξ ξ ξ k z 3 ijk ξ ξ ξ w ik ξ d ξ d ξ this is similar in structure to 11 accounting for the influence on the focal individual s movement rate of a third individual of type k at displacement ξ the outer integral over ξ allows for all possible starting locations for the focal individual f the other individual of type j in the pair also affects the movement rate of the focal individual 15 f f z 2 ij ξ ξ μ ij ξ ξ ξ w ij ξ ξ d ξ this is similar in structure to 13 but instead of the intrinsic movement rate m i accounts for the contribution to the focal individual s movement rate from the other individual of type j in the pair when the pair is initially separated by vector ξ ξ this contribution is w ij ξ ξ again the integral over ξ allows for all possible starting locations the key ecological information for movement bias is contained in μ ij ξ ξ ξ which is the probability density that the focal individual s movement vector is ξ conditional on the presence of an individual of type j located at ξ ξ relative to the focal individual this is the movement vector needed to create the ij pair separated by ξ as required as with the stochastic model eq 2 this is composed of two independent parts 16 μ ij ξ ξ ξ f i ξ g arg ξ η ij ξ ξ the first part f i ξ relates to the distance moved by an individual of type i which is independent of the neighbourhood and given by eq 3 the second part g arg ξ η ij ξ ξ is the probability density of moving in direction arg ξ which does depend on the neighbourhood this dependence is encapsulated in the expected bias vector η ij ξ ξ for an individual of type i separated from an individual of type j by a vector ξ ξ 17 η ij ξ ξ β i k v ik ξ z 3 ijk ξ ξ ξ z 2 ij ξ ξ d ξ v ij ξ ξ here v ik ξ is the gradient vector of the bias kernel v ik ξ eq 17 integrates over the neighbourhood of the focal individual for neighbouring individuals of type k then sums over all types k and adds the effect of the partner individual of type j in the pair the parameter β i gives an overall weight for the bias the bias vector provides the parameters for a circular probability distribution to match the stochastic model we use a von mises distribution with peak angle arg η ij and concentration η ij to obtain the probability density function of the angle arg ξ summing expressions 10 15 gives the total rate of change of the pair density z 2 ij ξ 18 t z 2 ij ξ t f a ξ t f f ξ t i j ξ j i ξ where the matching symmetric terms for the partner individual in the ij pair are given by the substitutions i j ξ j i ξ plank and law 2015 we give the function arguments in full to make clear the time dependence this is a formal exact description of how the movement rules at the level of the individual translate into a dynamical system of pair densities at the macroscopic level after averaging over many realisations of the stochastic process starting from the same statistical distribution 3 3 closure of the second moment dynamics the dynamical system is not yet closed because it contains the third spatial moment the density of triplets to deal with this a closure approximation is needed to replace the third moment by a function of lower order moments although not usually recognised closures are ubiquitous in ecological theory ignoring spatial structure completely implies a closure of the form z 2 ij ξ z 1 i z 1 j giving a dynamical system for the first moment average density i e the law of mass action or the so called mean field assumption a formal theory of closures at second order is a matter for research raghib et al 2011 dieckmann and law 2000 murrell et al 2004 here we use the kirkwood closure kirkwood 1935 19 z 3 ijk ξ ξ z 2 ij ξ z 2 ik ξ z 2 jk ξ ξ z 1 i z 1 j z 1 k as we have found the exact choice of closure makes little difference when the dynamics deal only with movement i e without birth and death see for example fig 6 3 in binny 2016 3 4 spatial moment dynamics as an approximation scheme after closure the dynamical system is no more than an approximation for the expected value of the second moment of the stochastic process because it ignores spatial information carried by higher order moments how well does this approximation work this is analogous to asking how well the mean field assumption works as a description of population dynamics the answer to that question is that the approximation is poor if neighbourhoods are important raghib et al 2011 the second order closure should be better because it does carry spatial information but would still be expected to become poor as higher order spatial structure becomes important fig 4 compares the spatial signal of the spatial moment dynamics with that of the stochastic individual based model from which the dynamical system 18 19 was derived for comparability with the stochastic results we assumed the movement rate to be independent of neighbourhood by setting w ij 0 in eqs 10 15 and leaving in place only an effect of neighbours on the direction of intrinsic movements this means that the spatial moment dynamics deal only with terms 10 13 geometries a and d in fig 3 we examined the dynamics for the bias kernels shown in fig 2a and b as these generate structure at a small spatial scale we would not expect to find a good approximation with the bias kernel in fig 2c because spatial structure remains at large spatial scales in other words the pair correlation ρ r does not approach 1 as r increases in fig 2i fig 4 shows that the approximation scheme captures some basic signals of the stochastic individual based model fig 4 shows the characteristic regular structure arising from repulsive bias manifested as a lack of pairs at short distance fig 4 shows the distinct cluster formation as a result of short range repulsion medium range attraction and long range repulsion although the quantitative match between the stochastic results and the spatial moments approximation is far from perfect the key qualitative features of the emergent spatial structure are captured in the second moment this illustrates two key points first it shows that the rules responsible for generating the spatial structure in the stochastic model are encapsulated by the dynamical system of spatial moments despite the latter appearing to be completely different second it demonstrates that much of the information about spatial structure is carried just in the second spatial moment in other words there is some justification for closing the hierarchy at second order the information shown in fig 4 would be lost completely in a mean field model which implicitly closes the system at the level of the first moment 4 discussion this work draws on recent advances in spatial moment dynamics models of collective cell behaviour binny et al 2016a surendran et al 2018b to address the issue of animal herding behaviour in ecology and opens new research avenues in this setting in particular we have explored how using different forms of neighbourhood interaction kernels for directionally biased movement can give rise to formation of animal groups or herds individual based models describing biased directional movement have been widely used in an ecological context codling and hill 2005 benhamou 2006 codling et al 2007 bode 2011 however this is the first time that a spatial moment dynamics model capturing the outcomes of this directional bias at the macroscopic scale has been used to describe animals living in groups in doing this we have shown the geometry of six flux terms that describe the exact relationship between the algorithmic individual based model and the mathematical model up to the second spatial moment our results show that herd like spatial structure can be generated solely from interactions among neighbouring individuals of the same species in reality this spatial structure can be strongly affected by interspecific interactions such as the presence of predators future work will include explicitly applying the model framework developed here to systems with multiple interacting species this has been done for cell obstacle interactions surendran et al 2018b and chase escape interactions surendran et al 2018a but these models use simple attractive or repulsive interactions rather than the distance dependent interactions that we employ here one advantage of spatial moment approximations over individual based models is that the equations for the dynamics of spatial moments are deterministic and only need to be solved once rather than performing computationally intensive repeated simulations they are also more tractable mathematically permitting further analysis and exploration of parameter space computational power typically restricts simulation of individual based models to systems with relatively low numbers of individuals due to the requirements of tracking each individual s movements and interactions with each of its neighbours over time there are many such examples of small herd systems in ecology see for example table 1 in reiczigel et al 2008 in contrast the computational requirement for solving the spatial moments approximation is independent of population size the methodology would lend itself to systems with much larger animal herds and offer insights that would otherwise require considerably greater computational resources to achieve through simulations alone although the spatial moment model shows the basic spatial structure its fit to the stochastic model could clearly be improved attenuation of the spatial signal with increasing distance is rather slow in fig 4b which generates inaccuracies that can propagate to shorter distances also at the shortest distances the model overestimates the strength of spatial structure this may be because after discretisation spatial resolution becomes less good as r 0 such issues could be dealt with by discretising over a larger space on a finer spatial grid but this would have made computation unfeasible in future work a fourier transform for the convolution integrals should be considered as this could provide a major increase in speed of computation previous models for animals living in herds have used the idea of zones of attraction and repulsion couzin et al 2002 bode 2011 a zone of repulsion is also supported by data krause et al 2002 zones of repulsion and attraction have also been modelled in the cell behaviour literature for example using the lennard jones kernel jeon et al 2010 and the morse potential middleton et al 2014 matsiaka et al 2017 our model incorporates and builds on these ideas including the possibility for multiple zones of attraction and repulsion with different spatial scales examples of the types of behaviour encapsulated by the bias kernels we have studied and the resulting spatial structure can be found in real animal populations for example gerum et al 2018 observed strong regular structure in king penguin aptenodytes patagonicus colonies caused by short range nest site protecting repulsive interactions between neighbours gajamannage et al 2017 studied the formation of small clusters in cows bos taurus generated by a balancing of costs to an individual of synchronisation e g needing to concede to the timings of a large group causing interrupted rest or grazing with the benefits of reduced predation risk for larger more defensible groups olson et al 2009 observed the formation of a mega herd in mongolian gazelles procapra gutturosa driven by habitat quality in a fragmented landscape some animal behaviour models also have an orientation component to make individuals move in the same direction sumpter et al 2008 this is more relevant for species where individuals in a group tend to be in continuous motion such as shoaling fish or flocking birds these situations require a velocity jump process codling et al 2007 2008 where reorientation events depend on the distance to and current orientation of other individuals in the neighbourhood agueh et al 2011 in principle the structure of such a population could be described by a second spatial moment in terms of the difference between the positions and orientations of two individuals in a pair but this problem is currently untackled acknowledgements rnb s ph d scholarship

24946,accurate prediction of chlorophyll a chl a concentration in surface water bodies such as lakes or rivers is crucial for water quality management this study improved the predictive simulation of instream chl a with the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf by adding automatic calibration and modifying the growth temperature formulation of phytoplankton in the original hspf model a total of 62 model parameters selected from a series of sensitivity analyses were automatically calibrated in a stepwise manner for different variables in the order of flow sediment water temperature ammonia nitrate couple and phosphate chl a couple with finer temporal resolution 5 8 days data than those of majority of the existing hspf studies the automatic calibration procedure provided the model with performance ratings of satisfactory or better for all the variables including nutrients and chl a the percent bias values ranged from 18 54 and 20 62 for nutrients and chl a respectively the original linear equation on the growth temperature relationship of phytoplankton in simulating instream chl a was modified using a quadratic equation and an exponential equation the exponential equation outperformed the original linear and quadratic equations particularly in simulating the excess concentrations of chl a observed during summer seasons for the validation data set the exponential equation predicted 78 of the eutrophic cases while the linear and quadratic equation only predicted 53 and 13 of the eutrophic cases respectively the modified hspf model offers an improved prediction of instream chl a this approach will be useful for providing early warning of algal blooms facilitating the implementation of effective management of stream water quality keywords chlorophyll a chl a phytoplankton algae hydrological simulation program fortran hspf automatic calibration sensitivity analysis 1 introduction chlorophyll a chl a is a simple and easy to measure indicator of the phytoplankton biomass in a water body and thus has long been used as a key water quality parameter for determining the trophic state of a water body boyer et al 2009 hutorowicz and pasztaleniec 2014 paerl et al 2003 although the level of chl a in a water body is a reflection of complicated interactions among various internal and external conditions of that water body including hydrological geological physicochemical and meteorological factors a high concentration of chl a is generally considered a symptom of water quality degradation due to excess nutrient inputs smith et al 1999 lee et al 2011 predictive simulation or forecasting of chl a concentration in a surface water body such as a lake or a stream has recently become an important task for water quality managers to ensure early warning of algal blooms in a water body it is also important in the development of a proactive management plan to counter eutrophication lee et al 2005 wagner and erickson 2017 however the interactions among the various environmental factors and their influences on the level of chl a can be very complicated and thus accurate prediction of chl a concentration remains a challenging task with rapidly advancing computer techniques and the development of model theories water quality models have become effective tools for predicting or forecasting water quality with their ability to simulate the transport of pollutants and their interactions with various environmental factors tim 1995 loucks and van beek 2005 most water quality models adopt numerical approaches to solve sets of differential equations that describe the underlying mechanisms and processes associated with pollutant fate and transport in and between the system components various water quality models have been developed to date for different types of water bodies with different spatial and time scales among these models watershed models have a broad applicability to water resources and quality management because they can provide an integrated knowledge of hydrological biological and physicochemical interactions within and among different watershed components such as surface waters ground waters and soil point and distributed pollutant sources singh and frevert 2006 for the past few decades watershed models have thus been widely used particularly for developing total maximum daily loads tmdls targeting different water quality parameters depending on their site specific significance jha et al 2010 chen et al 2011 sherk and linker 2013 for example eutrophication has been of great concern for surface water bodies such as streams and lakes the use of an appropriate watershed model enables direct estimation of the quantitative interactions between nutrient loads from catchments and phytoplankton growth typically represented by chl a in nested water bodies rendering the model a useful decision making tool auer et al 1986 debela et al 2006 the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf is one of the most comprehensive watershed models that is widely used in support of various regulatory and planning applications worldwide alberk et al 2004 fonseca et al 2014 hspf performs the integrated simulation of the surface soil and stream processes of hydrology hydraulics and water quality driven by continuous and dynamic storm events as well as the sources of point and nonpoint pollutants in a watershed its flexibility on various regional scales and land use types including urban and non urban land uses has rendered this model widely applicable bicknell et al 2001 in hspf a single lumped sum phytoplankton parameter is considered for calculating algal biomass the result is then transformed to a chl a concentration using an empirical chl a biomass ratio bicknell et al 2001 usepa 2013 hspf uses monod kinetics to calculate the phytoplankton growth rate incorporating various limiting factors such as nutrient concentrations light intensity including attenuation with water depth self shading effect and water temperature although the phytoplankton calculation module of hspf is sophisticated enough to consider most of the well known limiting factors in many situations it can be further refined to increase the accuracy of chl a simulation the current version of hspf hspf12 assumes that the maximum growth rate of the phytoplankton linearly increases as the water temperature increases until being retarded from a specific water temperature up to the upper temperature limit if the water temperature is outside of the lower or upper limits of the water temperature assigned by the users the growth is assumed to have ceased bicknell et al 2001 however according to the evidence found in many previous studies an envelope curve of the maximum growth rate versus water temperature is more appropriate for predicting total algal biomass consisting of multiple phytoplankton species with different temperature preferences and growth rates while the upper temperature limit for the growth termination can still be valid in a situation where the maximum water temperatures are above the optimum temperatures bowie et al 2019 another critical issue for achieving accurate hspf simulation is model calibration and validation most of the prior hspf studies focused on lumped sum variables for organics or nutrients as their modeling targets such as biological oxygen demand bod total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp however studies on chl a simulation are rare probably due to the intrinsic difficulty in validating the model with its very large number of model parameters that must be estimated or calibrated for hydrology as well as the many interrelated water quality variables furthermore while most previous hspf studies reported acceptable accuracy of the simulation results based on monthly data or monthly averaged data few studies have reported acceptable modeling accuracy based on data with a finer temporal resolution than months this study focuses on improving the chl a simulation accuracy with two approaches 1 improvement of the model validity using an automatic calibration procedure and 2 refinement of the temperature growth formulation of the phytoplankton to improve the chl a simulation accuracy the seom watershed in korea is used as an example but the procedure is generally applicable to other water bodies we conducted a global sensitivity analysis to select the model parameters to be calibrated the hspf model was automatically calibrated for the flow rate chl a and selected water quality variables most strongly related to phytoplankton growth including ionic nutrient species sediment and water temperature the formulation of the phytoplankton growth in the phytoplankton module of hspf was modified using two different mathematical expressions quadratic and exponential equations to improve the chl a predictability of the hspf model the model s validity was demonstrated using various indicator values of model accuracy the automatic calibration procedure demonstrated in this study and the resulting set of critical model parameters should be useful guidance for other site specific applications of a sophisticated watershed model such as hspf furthermore the refined hspf model with finely tuned model parameters will provide better forecasting or prediction of chl a supporting early warning techniques of algal blooms and allowing decision making for proactive algal management 2 methods 2 1 study site description the study area is the seom watershed of the south han river basin located in south korea fig 1 it includes 5 local administrative districts and two cities with a total population of 380 000 as of 2015 the area of the seom watershed is 1473 21 km2 and the mean elevation is 308 15 m with the average slope of 14 3 the mainstream of the seom watershed is the seom river with a length of 67 3 km and discharges into the han river in this area the annual average total precipitation is 1345 mm with over 65 of the total precipitation occurring from june to august however the total annual precipitation showed a decreasing trend during the study period from 2188 mm in 2011 to 908 mm in 2015 table 1 shows the land use composition of the seom watershed categorized into seven land use classes urban agricultural forest grassland wetland bare land and water the seom watershed is dominated by forest land use 75 63 followed by the agricultural land use 17 21 with only a relatively small fraction 3 65 of urban land use therefore the major nonpoint pollution sources are agricultural areas including crop lands and livestock farms the agricultural land of the seom watershed has typically been used for crop and livestock farming as of 2010 the total livestock number cattle pigs and poultry was 1 367 392 with a total livestock wastewater production of 5854 59 kg day ministry of environment 2010 http www wamis go kr the identified point sources of pollutants include effluents from six municipal tertiary wastewater treatment plants treatment capacity 500 m3 d 34 community wastewater treatment plants treatment capacity 500 m3 d three agro industrial wastewater treatment plants one wastewater treatment plant from an industrial complex mostly electronics and mechanic industries and one livestock wastewater treatment plant 2 2 hspf model setup 2 2 1 hspf model and data preparation the main modeling components of hspf are water quantity and quality processes on pervious land segment perlnd and impervious land segment implnd and free flow reach or well mixed reservoirs rchers processes considered in the pervious land segment perlnd include water budget snow melt sediment production and removal nitrogen and phosphorous behavior and pesticide behavior major processes considered in the impervious land segment implnd are overland flow and pollutant wash off the calculated water and constituents generated in the pervious and impervious land segments are transferred to the linked reach segments rchers where flow routing and transport simulations are conducted that involve various physico chemical parameters such as water temperature dissolved oxygen ph inorganic carbon alkalinity organic and inorganic constituents nitrogen and phosphorous planktons and their interactions with sediment and atmosphere fig 2 shows the components of the hspf model built up for the study area the data input to the model include meteorological data spatial data monitoring data and point source data the meteorological data include time series data of hourly rainfall wind speed solar radiation cloud amount due point topsoil temperature and daily minimum and maximum air temperatures collected during the study period at the wonju meteorological station located within the study area the spatial data include the most recent versions of a 30 m x 30 m resolution digital elevation model 2014 and gis layers of the watershed boundary 2014 stream network 2014 and land uses 2013 which were obtained from relevant governmental agencies no profound changes in these spatial characteristics were reported during the study period when constructing the model the study area was divided into thirteen subwatersheds based on the major tributaries 2nd order streams of the seom river the main stream of the study area spatial analyses necessary for obtaining boundaries areas and average elevations of the subwatersheds were conducted using arcgis 10 0 esri california usa for the purpose of model calibration and validation the water quality and flow rate data at the outlet point of the seom watershed were obtained from the ministry of environment moe korea the flow rate data comprised the daily values of the river discharge the water quality data included water temperature tw concentrations of chl a phosphate po4 3 nitrate no3 ammonium nh4 and suspended solids ss measured at intervals of 5 8 days for the input point source data daily flow rates and major pollutant concentrations bod tn tp and ss of the effluents from the wastewater treatment plants were obtained from moe the concentrations of nh4 no3 and po4 3 in the effluent were then estimated using the average fractions of these species in tn and tp as reported elsewhere kang et al 2005 park et al 2013 2 2 2 modifications of the phytoplankton module in hspf phytoplankton is simulated as a single lumped variable of many species and the plank module simulates the core biological processes of the phytoplankton in the reach segment in plank the temperature dependency of the maximum growth rate of the phytoplankton is considered using a piecewise linear function as shown in fig 3 the piecewise linear function consists of a linear function with a positive slope between the lower temperature limit talgrl and the optimal temperature talgrm and a constant function between talgrm and the upper temperature limit talgrh to simulate the growth retardation in this higher temperature range if the water temperature is below talgrl or above talgrh the growth is assumed to cease completely in this study the linear function defined between talgrl and talgrm was modified with two different curvilinear functions i e quadratic and exponential as illustrated in fig 3 and the accuracies of the chl a prediction after the modifications were examined a previous supporting hypothesis of this modification was that a curvilinear function might better represent the temperature growth relationship of phytoplankton when many species are grouped together in the simulation of total biomass bowie et al 2019 we then compared the accuracies of the chl a prediction for the following three formulations over the temperature range between talgrl and talgrm 1 linear original equation tcmal tw talgrl talgrm talgrl 2 quadratic tcmal tw2 talgrl2 talgrm2 talgrl2 3 exponential tcmalg exp tw exp talgrl exp talgrm exp talgrl 2 3 sensitive analysis a sensitivity analysis was performed using the latin hypercube one factor at a time lh oat method which is known to be a cost effective method in many water quality modeling applications van griensven et al 2006 park et al 2014 the lh oat method is based on the monte carlo simulation but uses a stratified sampling technique for selecting the values of input parameters called latin hypercube lh sampling followed by the one factor at a time oat sampling a number of random sets of the input parameters are sampled from the strata of evenly subdivided parameter hyperspace with an equal probability the sample points are selected such that each interval of each input parameter is sampled only once i e lh points the method then operates a series of loops of model simulation by changing one parameter at a time i e oat sampling around each latin hypercube lh point and then computes the partial effect for each parameter and each lh point eq 4 the final effect of a parameter is calculated by averaging the partial effects over all lh points eq 5 as such local sensitivities i e partial effects are integrated into a global sensitivity i e final effect the variance of the partial effects measures the existence of nonlinearity or correlations with other input parameters van griensven et al 2006 4 s i j 100 m e 1 e i 1 f i e p m e 1 e i e p m e 1 e i 1 f i e p m e 1 e i e p 2 f i 5 s l h i j 1 n s i j where m is the model function si j is the partial effect of the parameter ei for a given lh point j fi is the changing fraction of the parameter ei whose sign is randomly defined n is the total number of lh points and slh i is the final sensitivity value for the parameter ei among the numerous hydrological parameters a total of ten parameters frequently reported in the literature as important parameters for flow calibration were selected us epa 2000 abdulla et al 2007 laware and rifai 2006 in contrast sensitivity analyses for the model parameters associated with water quality were rarely conducted in previous hspf modeling studies and no published hspf literature reporting the sensitivities of model parameters in relation to chl a was found therefore most of the model parameters associated with the water quality processes involved in the simulation mode of this hspf modeling were considered a total of 87 model parameters were thus considered in the sensitivity analysis including the parameters associated with hydrology sediment tw two nitrogen species nh4 and no3 po4 3 and chl a ammonia can be transformed into nitrate by nitrification under oxidizing condition and thus sensitivities of the model parameters for the ammonia processes to the nitrate concentration were also investigated similarly mutual sensitivities of the parameters for phosphate and phytoplankton on the concentrations of po4 p and chl a were examined because phosphate is a critical limiting factor of phytoplankton growth a full list of the model parameters and their ranges used for the sensitivity analysis are provided in supplementary materials table s1 5 the root mean square errors rmse between the observed and simulated values of flow rate or target water quality variables at the outlet point of the study watershed were used as the model function for the sensitivity calculation for each model parameter 50 lh points with four different changing fractions for the model parameters changing fraction f 0 05 0 10 0 15 and 0 20 were evaluated to determine the sensitivities of the model which were then averaged over the four fractions for the sensitivity ranking of the model parameters the repeated running of hspf with varying model parameter values required for the sensitivity analysis was automated by implementing the lh oat algorithm in matlab r2017a mathworks massachusetts usa linked with hspf 2 4 model calibration and validation the model was run for six years from jan 2010 to dec 2015 consisting of warmup 2010 calibration 2011 2013 and validation periods 2014 2015 the ten hydrological parameters as well as the impervious fractions of the respective six land use classes excluding water land use urban agricultural forest grassland wetland and bare land were calibrated with respect to the measured flow data among the model parameters of water quality processes those that can be estimated by topographical and meteorological information were fixed to select the parameters of water quality processes for calibration the results of the sensitivity analysis were referenced model parameters with a lh oat sensitivity value slh smaller than 0 1 were considered as insensitive and excluded in the calibration the model was calibrated in a stepwise manner as follows the model was first calibrated for the flow rate followed by sediment tw nh4 no3 couple and po4 3 chl a couple in order in each calibration for the flow rate sediment and tw the relevant model parameters were optimized by minimizing the rmse value between the observed and simulated values at the watershed outlet the model parameters for the two nitrogen species were simultaneously calibrated using the sum of the rmse values normalized by the mean observed values i e the normalized rmse or nrmse for nh4 and no3 as a minimized objective function similarly the parameters associated with po4 3 and chl a were simultaneously calibrated using the sum of the nrmse values for po4 3 and chl a because phosphorous is the most critical limiting nutrient species on the phytoplankton growth hecky and kilham 1988 labry et al 2005 elser et al 2011 and thus the model parameters for po4 3 and chl a have strong mutual influences in the simulation we did not conduct any intensive calibration for the organics and associated water parameters such as bod or dissolved oxygen do as we assumed that these parameters have little influence on the chl a simulation results the study stream was sufficiently shallow observed water depth ranged from 0 67 to 3 59 m such that it was always under oxidizing conditions minimum values of observed and simulated do were 6 4 mg l and 4 3 mg l respectively during the study period therefore the variability of the do may not have a measurable influence on the phytoplankton growth or associated benthic processes such as phosphorous release for the model calibration an automatic calibration procedure was applied using the complex random factorization method box 1965 guin 1968 barco et al 2008 implemented in matlab r2017a mathworks massachusetts usa and coupled with hspf detailed descriptions on the complex random factorization method and its implementation on matlab with repeated running procedure of hspf can be found in supplementary material appendices a and b 2 5 evaluation of model accuracy various indicators were used to evaluate the accuracy of the model including the coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the percent bias pbias and the rmse observation standard deviation ratio rsr defined as follows moriasi et al 2007 6 r 2 n t 1 n s t o t t 1 n s t t 1 n o t n t 1 n s t 2 t 1 n s t 2 n t 1 n o t 2 t 1 n o t 2 2 7 n s e 1 t 1 n o t s t 2 t 1 n o t o m e a n 2 8 p b i a s t 1 n o t s t t 1

value and s t is the simulated value at time t r2 derived from pearson s correlation coefficient ranges from 0 to 1 and the model is considered more accurate as the value of r2 approaches 1 in general a model with an r2 value greater than 0 5 is considered reasonable legates and mccabe 1999 nse is one of the most commonly used indicators for judging the accuracy of a hydrological or water quality model moriasi et al 2007 the range of nse is from to 1 nash and sutcliffe 1970 with the greatest accuracy at 1 percent bias pbias is the average offset of the simulated values with regard to their observed values in percentage gupta et al 1999 as the pbias value approaches 0 the accuracy of the model increases positive and negative values of pbias indicate underestimation and overestimation biases of the model respectively gupta et al 1999 the rsr defines the deviation of the model relative to the variation of the measured values a lower rsr indicates a better model simulation performance moriasi et al 2007 the criteria for the performance ratings very good good satisfactory and unsatisfactory of the pbias rsr and nse values on a monthly time step simulation for the flow sediment nitrogen and phosphorous are given in supplementary materials table s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 parameter sensitivities the sensitivities and the calibrated values of the model parameters selected for the model calibration are summarized in tables 1 3 a total of 62 parameters were selected for the model calibration based on their sensitivities for the rmse values for the flow rate or water quality variables the remaining 25 model parameters were found to be less sensitive and were therefore not further considered for the model calibration table 1 summarizes the results of sensitivity analysis and model calibration for the parameters associated with hydrology sediment and water temperature among the 10 hydrological parameters those associated with the recession rates of groundwater and interflow agwrc and irc the lower zone storage lzsn and infiltration capacity of the soil infilt showed greater influence on the simulated stream flow than the other parameters although most of the 14 selected sediment parameters table 1 were moderately sensitive to the sediment simulation in the stream slh 10 those incorporated in the wash off equation kser jser keim and jeim and the detachment equation jrer showed greater sensitivities compared to the other parameters in the simulation of water temperature the temperature of ground tgrnd and the heat conductance coefficient kmud showed the highest sensitivity the long wave radiation coefficient katrad was also significantly influential table 2 summarizes the results of sensitivity analysis and model calibration with respect to ammonia nh3 nh4 and nitrate no3 the most sensitive parameter for nh4 n concentration was the unit oxidation rate of total ammonia at 20 c ktam20 the major sensitive parameters for nitrogen species were the concentration of ammonia or nitrate in active groundwater outflow aoqc the accumulation rate of ammonia or nitrate in impervious surfaces implnd acqop the maximum storage of ammonia or nitrate in impervious surfaces implnd sqolim and the rate of surface runoff of ammonia or nitrate in impervious surfaces implnd wsqop the unit denitrification rate kno230 was minimally sensitive for the no3 n concentration because the stream was always under oxidizing conditions during the simulation period table 3 summarizes the results of sensitivity analysis and model calibration with respect to phosphate po4 3 and chl a the main influencing parameters on the po4 p concentration were the wash off potency factors in pervious and impervious land surfaces potfw followed by the upper limit of water temperature for the phytoplankton growth talgrh and the benthic release rate of ortho phosphate under aerobic conditions brpo41 however the benthic release rate of ortho phosphate under anaerobic conditions brop42 was not considered for calibration because it was insensitive under the oxidizing conditions maintained throughout the study period the main influencing parameters on the chl a concentration were the maximal unit growth rate of phytoplankton malgr the rate of phytoplankton settling physet and the ratio of chl a content of biomass to phosphorous content ratclp the three temperature parameters talgrh talgrl and talgrm determining the maximum growth rate of phytoplankton showed moderate or minimal influences on the chl a concentration probably due to the limitation of the linear temperature growth formulation of hspf in simulating the excessive increase in the phytoplankton population at high temperature ranges the results of the sensitivity rankings of all the model parameters are provided in supplementary materials tables s7 8 3 2 instream calibration of the model fig 4 shows the simulation results of the calibrated model graphically comparing the observed and simulated flow rates tw and concentrations of sediment nh4 n no3 n po4 p and chl a in the flow and tw simulation the measured values and simulated values are well fitted the peak flow rates are also well matched between the observed and simulated values the simulated sediment concentrations tss closely agreed with the measured values during the calibration period whereas they tended to be lower than the observed values during the spring seasons particularly in the validation period with relatively lower precipitations and flow rates compared to the calibration period the high tss concentration observed during the spring season that was not properly simulated by the model might be due to the unidentified sources of sediment soil in streams generated from season specific rice farming activities in the study area in korea paddy field farming is the typical method of rice growing and requires large quantities of water for irrigation during the spring seasons this results in discharge of the overflowing irrigation water with entrained pollutants including particles song et al 2013 the simulated nh4 n and no3 n concentrations closely followed the seasonal patterns of the measured values concentrations of the nitrogen species were generally higher during winter seasons which was coincidence with the seasonality of the effluent tn concentrations of the wastewater treatment plants the concentration of nh4 n was remarkably higher during the winter season than during non winter seasons with nh4 n concentration maintained at a very low level 0 05 mg l in contrast the seasonality of no3 n concentration was less significant and generally higher than nh4 n concentration throughout all seasons in the hspf model the difference in the seasonal variation between nh4 n and no3 n was reproduced by allowing monthly variable concentration parameters in the active groundwater aoqc the pollutant accumulation and wash off coefficients in the catchment were assumed to be temporarily constant and thus any possible seasonality in atmospheric deposition were not considered in the simulation the calibration results showed that nitrate concentration in the active groundwater aoqc was maintained between 2 1 3 5 mg l functioning as an effective supplier of nitrate to the stream this result is supported by the nitrate contamination of the groundwater frequently reported in asian agricultural areas including korea jeon et al 2011 liu et al 2017 by comparing the simulation results with and without phytoplankton processes the seasonality and concentrations of nitrogen species were not found to be significantly affected by the time varying phytoplankton growth rate because nitrogen generally was less limited for the phytoplankton growth in the stream water of the study site average tn tp molar ratio of the observed data 75 16 the redfield ratio the observed and simulated concentrations of po4 p were generally higher during winter seasons than non winter seasons however the seasonality of the po4 p concentration was less profound in the observation than in the simulation the simulated po4 p concentration was near zero during summer seasons whereas the observed po4 p concentration was constantly maintained above the detection limit 0 02 0 05 mg p l during the same seasons this difference in the background level of po4 p between the observation and simulation might be caused by the background phosphorous sources such as atmospheric deposition and soils rocks weathering which were not considered in the model gardner 1990 tipping et al 2014 the influences of active groundwater on the phosphorous concentration in streams can be considered insignificant because of the low mobility of phosphorous in the groundwater holman et al 2008 therefore the surface runoff driven by precipitation can be the major factor affecting the temporal variation of the po4 p inputs to the streams however the larger input of phosphorous during the summer season might not always result in a high instream concentration of phosphorous because phosphorous introduced into streams can be largely consumed by phytoplankton at higher temperature conditions during the season the original hspf model was used to simulate the seasonal trend of chl a predicting higher concentrations during summer but the chl a concentration was generally underestimated throughout the study period hspf simulates only one group of phytoplankton species using a linear temperature growth formulation this becomes its intrinsic limitation in simulating varying growth tendencies of diverse phytoplankton species with different optimal growth temperatures possibly present in surface water bodies the model failed to simulate the base level of chl a during the non summer seasons and the excess level of chl a during the summer seasons 3 3 improvements on the chl a simulation fig 5 compares the observed and simulated concentrations of po4 p and chl a for the three different equations to describe the temperature growth relationship of the phytoplankton the original linear equation and two modifications into quadratic and exponential equations in this study we focused on the accuracy of the model in simulating the excessively high concentrations of chl a occurring in the summer seasons which is the primary management target for water quality managers as shown in fig 5 the exponential equation better simulates the patterns of chl a that substantially increase during the summer seasons table 4 summarizes the performance of the model in predicting the trophic states of the water based on the eutrophic state criteria chl a 20 μg l carlson 1996 the linear and exponential equations showed the same prediction accuracy of 84 and 92 for the eutrophic and oligo mesotrophic states respectively in calibration while the exponential equation outperformed the linear equation in predicting both trophic states the performance of quadratic equation was always less than that of linear and exponential equations the exponential equation was especially useful in simulating the summer seasons with high concentrations of chl a 3 4 performance of the calibrated model table 5 shows a summary of the four different accuracy indicators computed for different constituents simulated by the hspf model similarly to prior studies he and hogue 2012 stern et al 2016 the model showed relatively good performance for flow and tw based on all the indicators being within their satisfactory ranges r2 0 7 nse 0 7 pbias 15 71 25 14 and psr 0 53 for the sediment all indicator values of the calibration period were satisfactory or better while the accuracy indicators of the validation period were relatively poor except for pbias the values of pbias for all variables were within the satisfactory performance ranges in both the calibration and validation periods several previous studies reporting the values of r2 or nse on the sediment could be found in the literature table s9 ranging from 0 37 to 0 94 for r2 from daily or monthly calibration and from 3 51 to 0 92 for nse from monthly calibration saleh et al 2000 santhi et al 2001 saleh and du 2004 bracmort et al 2006 stern et al 2016 ahn and kim 2016 no reported values of daily basis nse for sediment were found in the literature while the accuracy of the sediment simulation of this study was comparable to that of the previous studies the accuracy for the validation period was relatively low the relatively low precipitation in the validation period resulted in low simulated tss concentrations in the stream increasing the deviation from the high tss concentration observed in the spring seasons may be a result from the discharge of the paddy fields as mentioned previously see fig 3 the values of r2 nse and rsr for nitrogen species po4 p and chl a were generally within the ranges of unsatisfactory performance ratings while the performance ratings based on pbias were satisfactory or better for all constituents and simulation periods calibration and validation however the indicator values in this study were comparable to those in the previous studies table s9 considering that the temporal resolutions 5 8 days used in this study were finer than those used in most of the previous studies in which monthly calibrations were used when the indicator values were recalculated using monthly averaged data the values in the parenthesis in table 5 the accuracies generally improved furthermore most of the previous studies rated the model performance targeting lumped sum variables e g tn tp or a sum of organic n and no3 n which may generally result in better model performance ratings compared to this study targeting a single species e g no3 n or po4 p moriasi et al 2007 no previous studies reported the accuracy indicators of nh4 and chl a as show in table 5 the exponential temperature growth model was slightly better in simulating the chl a concentration when considering the values of r2 relatively high in both the calibration and validation steps however the linear temperature growth model outperformed the exponential temperature growth model in the calibration step based on the nse values the monthly values of nse were 0 37 and 0 29 for the linear and exponential temperature growth models respectively however it should be noted that the exponential temperature growth model could be more valuable for simulating the excess growth of phytoplankton during summer seasons 4 conclusions this study offered an improved accuracy of the instream chl a simulation in the hspf model using an automatic calibration and modification on the chl a calculation module important model parameters were selected from senstivity analyses and then automatically calibrated from this study the following conclusions are made 1 sets of crucial hspf model parameters for flow water temperature sediment ionic nutrient species and chl a were drawn through the lh oat sensitivity analysis which were selected as the parameters to be automatically calibrated by the complex random factorization algorithm the suggested crucial parameter sets can be used as guidance for other watershed modeling applications with different site specific conditions 2 the complex random factorization algorithm was applied in a stepwise manner for different parameter groups and was effective in automatically calibrating the hspf model which is intrinsically difficult and thus no attempts have been made in pervious studies 3 the performance ratings of the calibrated model with 5 8 day interval time series data were better than or equal to the satisfactory levels for individual ionic nutrient species and chl a the obtained performance ratings were fairly comparable with those in the literature which were mostly based on monthly calibration or based on gross nutrient parameters such as total nitrogen and total phosphorous no chl a calibration reports were found in the existing hspf modeling literature 4 among the three formulations of the temperature growth relationship of phytoplankton the exponential equation was more efficient than the original linear equation or the quadratic equation in simulating excess growth of phytoplankton during summer seasons this study demonstrated how the extremely large number of model parameters of a sophisticated watershed model such as hspf can be managed to ensure the model s validity it also demonstrated how the critical modification on the phytoplankton growth formulation can improve the chl a simulation as a future study coupling such model with remote sensing of chl a could improve our understanding the dynamics of algal blooms the improved chl a simulation using the approach suggested in this study coupled with remote sensing modeling in the future should be useful for early

24946,accurate prediction of chlorophyll a chl a concentration in surface water bodies such as lakes or rivers is crucial for water quality management this study improved the predictive simulation of instream chl a with the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf by adding automatic calibration and modifying the growth temperature formulation of phytoplankton in the original hspf model a total of 62 model parameters selected from a series of sensitivity analyses were automatically calibrated in a stepwise manner for different variables in the order of flow sediment water temperature ammonia nitrate couple and phosphate chl a couple with finer temporal resolution 5 8 days data than those of majority of the existing hspf studies the automatic calibration procedure provided the model with performance ratings of satisfactory or better for all the variables including nutrients and chl a the percent bias values ranged from 18 54 and 20 62 for nutrients and chl a respectively the original linear equation on the growth temperature relationship of phytoplankton in simulating instream chl a was modified using a quadratic equation and an exponential equation the exponential equation outperformed the original linear and quadratic equations particularly in simulating the excess concentrations of chl a observed during summer seasons for the validation data set the exponential equation predicted 78 of the eutrophic cases while the linear and quadratic equation only predicted 53 and 13 of the eutrophic cases respectively the modified hspf model offers an improved prediction of instream chl a this approach will be useful for providing early warning of algal blooms facilitating the implementation of effective management of stream water quality keywords chlorophyll a chl a phytoplankton algae hydrological simulation program fortran hspf automatic calibration sensitivity analysis 1 introduction chlorophyll a chl a is a simple and easy to measure indicator of the phytoplankton biomass in a water body and thus has long been used as a key water quality parameter for determining the trophic state of a water body boyer et al 2009 hutorowicz and pasztaleniec 2014 paerl et al 2003 although the level of chl a in a water body is a reflection of complicated interactions among various internal and external conditions of that water body including hydrological geological physicochemical and meteorological factors a high concentration of chl a is generally considered a symptom of water quality degradation due to excess nutrient inputs smith et al 1999 lee et al 2011 predictive simulation or forecasting of chl a concentration in a surface water body such as a lake or a stream has recently become an important task for water quality managers to ensure early warning of algal blooms in a water body it is also important in the development of a proactive management plan to counter eutrophication lee et al 2005 wagner and erickson 2017 however the interactions among the various environmental factors and their influences on the level of chl a can be very complicated and thus accurate prediction of chl a concentration remains a challenging task with rapidly advancing computer techniques and the development of model theories water quality models have become effective tools for predicting or forecasting water quality with their ability to simulate the transport of pollutants and their interactions with various environmental factors tim 1995 loucks and van beek 2005 most water quality models adopt numerical approaches to solve sets of differential equations that describe the underlying mechanisms and processes associated with pollutant fate and transport in and between the system components various water quality models have been developed to date for different types of water bodies with different spatial and time scales among these models watershed models have a broad applicability to water resources and quality management because they can provide an integrated knowledge of hydrological biological and physicochemical interactions within and among different watershed components such as surface waters ground waters and soil point and distributed pollutant sources singh and frevert 2006 for the past few decades watershed models have thus been widely used particularly for developing total maximum daily loads tmdls targeting different water quality parameters depending on their site specific significance jha et al 2010 chen et al 2011 sherk and linker 2013 for example eutrophication has been of great concern for surface water bodies such as streams and lakes the use of an appropriate watershed model enables direct estimation of the quantitative interactions between nutrient loads from catchments and phytoplankton growth typically represented by chl a in nested water bodies rendering the model a useful decision making tool auer et al 1986 debela et al 2006 the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf is one of the most comprehensive watershed models that is widely used in support of various regulatory and planning applications worldwide alberk et al 2004 fonseca et al 2014 hspf performs the integrated simulation of the surface soil and stream processes of hydrology hydraulics and water quality driven by continuous and dynamic storm events as well as the sources of point and nonpoint pollutants in a watershed its flexibility on various regional scales and land use types including urban and non urban land uses has rendered this model widely applicable bicknell et al 2001 in hspf a single lumped sum phytoplankton parameter is considered for calculating algal biomass the result is then transformed to a chl a concentration using an empirical chl a biomass ratio bicknell et al 2001 usepa 2013 hspf uses monod kinetics to calculate the phytoplankton growth rate incorporating various limiting factors such as nutrient concentrations light intensity including attenuation with water depth self shading effect and water temperature although the phytoplankton calculation module of hspf is sophisticated enough to consider most of the well known limiting factors in many situations it can be further refined to increase the accuracy of chl a simulation the current version of hspf hspf12 assumes that the maximum growth rate of the phytoplankton linearly increases as the water temperature increases until being retarded from a specific water temperature up to the upper temperature limit if the water temperature is outside of the lower or upper limits of the water temperature assigned by the users the growth is assumed to have ceased bicknell et al 2001 however according to the evidence found in many previous studies an envelope curve of the maximum growth rate versus water temperature is more appropriate for predicting total algal biomass consisting of multiple phytoplankton species with different temperature preferences and growth rates while the upper temperature limit for the growth termination can still be valid in a situation where the maximum water temperatures are above the optimum temperatures bowie et al 2019 another critical issue for achieving accurate hspf simulation is model calibration and validation most of the prior hspf studies focused on lumped sum variables for organics or nutrients as their modeling targets such as biological oxygen demand bod total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp however studies on chl a simulation are rare probably due to the intrinsic difficulty in validating the model with its very large number of model parameters that must be estimated or calibrated for hydrology as well as the many interrelated water quality variables furthermore while most previous hspf studies reported acceptable accuracy of the simulation results based on monthly data or monthly averaged data few studies have reported acceptable modeling accuracy based on data with a finer temporal resolution than months this study focuses on improving the chl a simulation accuracy with two approaches 1 improvement of the model validity using an automatic calibration procedure and 2 refinement of the temperature growth formulation of the phytoplankton to improve the chl a simulation accuracy the seom watershed in korea is used as an example but the procedure is generally applicable to other water bodies we conducted a global sensitivity analysis to select the model parameters to be calibrated the hspf model was automatically calibrated for the flow rate chl a and selected water quality variables most strongly related to phytoplankton growth including ionic nutrient species sediment and water temperature the formulation of the phytoplankton growth in the phytoplankton module of hspf was modified using two different mathematical expressions quadratic and exponential equations to improve the chl a predictability of the hspf model the model s validity was demonstrated using various indicator values of model accuracy the automatic calibration procedure demonstrated in this study and the resulting set of critical model parameters should be useful guidance for other site specific applications of a sophisticated watershed model such as hspf furthermore the refined hspf model with finely tuned model parameters will provide better forecasting or prediction of chl a supporting early warning techniques of algal blooms and allowing decision making for proactive algal management 2 methods 2 1 study site description the study area is the seom watershed of the south han river basin located in south korea fig 1 it includes 5 local administrative districts and two cities with a total population of 380 000 as of 2015 the area of the seom watershed is 1473 21 km2 and the mean elevation is 308 15 m with the average slope of 14 3 the mainstream of the seom watershed is the seom river with a length of 67 3 km and discharges into the han river in this area the annual average total precipitation is 1345 mm with over 65 of the total precipitation occurring from june to august however the total annual precipitation showed a decreasing trend during the study period from 2188 mm in 2011 to 908 mm in 2015 table 1 shows the land use composition of the seom watershed categorized into seven land use classes urban agricultural forest grassland wetland bare land and water the seom watershed is dominated by forest land use 75 63 followed by the agricultural land use 17 21 with only a relatively small fraction 3 65 of urban land use therefore the major nonpoint pollution sources are agricultural areas including crop lands and livestock farms the agricultural land of the seom watershed has typically been used for crop and livestock farming as of 2010 the total livestock number cattle pigs and poultry was 1 367 392 with a total livestock wastewater production of 5854 59 kg day ministry of environment 2010 http www wamis go kr the identified point sources of pollutants include effluents from six municipal tertiary wastewater treatment plants treatment capacity 500 m3 d 34 community wastewater treatment plants treatment capacity 500 m3 d three agro industrial wastewater treatment plants one wastewater treatment plant from an industrial complex mostly electronics and mechanic industries and one livestock wastewater treatment plant 2 2 hspf model setup 2 2 1 hspf model and data preparation the main modeling components of hspf are water quantity and quality processes on pervious land segment perlnd and impervious land segment implnd and free flow reach or well mixed reservoirs rchers processes considered in the pervious land segment perlnd include water budget snow melt sediment production and removal nitrogen and phosphorous behavior and pesticide behavior major processes considered in the impervious land segment implnd are overland flow and pollutant wash off the calculated water and constituents generated in the pervious and impervious land segments are transferred to the linked reach segments rchers where flow routing and transport simulations are conducted that involve various physico chemical parameters such as water temperature dissolved oxygen ph inorganic carbon alkalinity organic and inorganic constituents nitrogen and phosphorous planktons and their interactions with sediment and atmosphere fig 2 shows the components of the hspf model built up for the study area the data input to the model include meteorological data spatial data monitoring data and point source data the meteorological data include time series data of hourly rainfall wind speed solar radiation cloud amount due point topsoil temperature and daily minimum and maximum air temperatures collected during the study period at the wonju meteorological station located within the study area the spatial data include the most recent versions of a 30 m x 30 m resolution digital elevation model 2014 and gis layers of the watershed boundary 2014 stream network 2014 and land uses 2013 which were obtained from relevant governmental agencies no profound changes in these spatial characteristics were reported during the study period when constructing the model the study area was divided into thirteen subwatersheds based on the major tributaries 2nd order streams of the seom river the main stream of the study area spatial analyses necessary for obtaining boundaries areas and average elevations of the subwatersheds were conducted using arcgis 10 0 esri california usa for the purpose of model calibration and validation the water quality and flow rate data at the outlet point of the seom watershed were obtained from the ministry of environment moe korea the flow rate data comprised the daily values of the river discharge the water quality data included water temperature tw concentrations of chl a phosphate po4 3 nitrate no3 ammonium nh4 and suspended solids ss measured at intervals of 5 8 days for the input point source data daily flow rates and major pollutant concentrations bod tn tp and ss of the effluents from the wastewater treatment plants were obtained from moe the concentrations of nh4 no3 and po4 3 in the effluent were then estimated using the average fractions of these species in tn and tp as reported elsewhere kang et al 2005 park et al 2013 2 2 2 modifications of the phytoplankton module in hspf phytoplankton is simulated as a single lumped variable of many species and the plank module simulates the core biological processes of the phytoplankton in the reach segment in plank the temperature dependency of the maximum growth rate of the phytoplankton is considered using a piecewise linear function as shown in fig 3 the piecewise linear function consists of a linear function with a positive slope between the lower temperature limit talgrl and the optimal temperature talgrm and a constant function between talgrm and the upper temperature limit talgrh to simulate the growth retardation in this higher temperature range if the water temperature is below talgrl or above talgrh the growth is assumed to cease completely in this study the linear function defined between talgrl and talgrm was modified with two different curvilinear functions i e quadratic and exponential as illustrated in fig 3 and the accuracies of the chl a prediction after the modifications were examined a previous supporting hypothesis of this modification was that a curvilinear function might better represent the temperature growth relationship of phytoplankton when many species are grouped together in the simulation of total biomass bowie et al 2019 we then compared the accuracies of the chl a prediction for the following three formulations over the temperature range between talgrl and talgrm 1 linear original equation tcmal tw talgrl talgrm talgrl 2 quadratic tcmal tw2 talgrl2 talgrm2 talgrl2 3 exponential tcmalg exp tw exp talgrl exp talgrm exp talgrl 2 3 sensitive analysis a sensitivity analysis was performed using the latin hypercube one factor at a time lh oat method which is known to be a cost effective method in many water quality modeling applications van griensven et al 2006 park et al 2014 the lh oat method is based on the monte carlo simulation but uses a stratified sampling technique for selecting the values of input parameters called latin hypercube lh sampling followed by the one factor at a time oat sampling a number of random sets of the input parameters are sampled from the strata of evenly subdivided parameter hyperspace with an equal probability the sample points are selected such that each interval of each input parameter is sampled only once i e lh points the method then operates a series of loops of model simulation by changing one parameter at a time i e oat sampling around each latin hypercube lh point and then computes the partial effect for each parameter and each lh point eq 4 the final effect of a parameter is calculated by averaging the partial effects over all lh points eq 5 as such local sensitivities i e partial effects are integrated into a global sensitivity i e final effect the variance of the partial effects measures the existence of nonlinearity or correlations with other input parameters van griensven et al 2006 4 s i j 100 m e 1 e i 1 f i e p m e 1 e i e p m e 1 e i 1 f i e p m e 1 e i e p 2 f i 5 s l h i j 1 n s i j where m is the model function si j is the partial effect of the parameter ei for a given lh point j fi is the changing fraction of the parameter ei whose sign is randomly defined n is the total number of lh points and slh i is the final sensitivity value for the parameter ei among the numerous hydrological parameters a total of ten parameters frequently reported in the literature as important parameters for flow calibration were selected us epa 2000 abdulla et al 2007 laware and rifai 2006 in contrast sensitivity analyses for the model parameters associated with water quality were rarely conducted in previous hspf modeling studies and no published hspf literature reporting the sensitivities of model parameters in relation to chl a was found therefore most of the model parameters associated with the water quality processes involved in the simulation mode of this hspf modeling were considered a total of 87 model parameters were thus considered in the sensitivity analysis including the parameters associated with hydrology sediment tw two nitrogen species nh4 and no3 po4 3 and chl a ammonia can be transformed into nitrate by nitrification under oxidizing condition and thus sensitivities of the model parameters for the ammonia processes to the nitrate concentration were also investigated similarly mutual sensitivities of the parameters for phosphate and phytoplankton on the concentrations of po4 p and chl a were examined because phosphate is a critical limiting factor of phytoplankton growth a full list of the model parameters and their ranges used for the sensitivity analysis are provided in supplementary materials table s1 5 the root mean square errors rmse between the observed and simulated values of flow rate or target water quality variables at the outlet point of the study watershed were used as the model function for the sensitivity calculation for each model parameter 50 lh points with four different changing fractions for the model parameters changing fraction f 0 05 0 10 0 15 and 0 20 were evaluated to determine the sensitivities of the model which were then averaged over the four fractions for the sensitivity ranking of the model parameters the repeated running of hspf with varying model parameter values required for the sensitivity analysis was automated by implementing the lh oat algorithm in matlab r2017a mathworks massachusetts usa linked with hspf 2 4 model calibration and validation the model was run for six years from jan 2010 to dec 2015 consisting of warmup 2010 calibration 2011 2013 and validation periods 2014 2015 the ten hydrological parameters as well as the impervious fractions of the respective six land use classes excluding water land use urban agricultural forest grassland wetland and bare land were calibrated with respect to the measured flow data among the model parameters of water quality processes those that can be estimated by topographical and meteorological information were fixed to select the parameters of water quality processes for calibration the results of the sensitivity analysis were referenced model parameters with a lh oat sensitivity value slh smaller than 0 1 were considered as insensitive and excluded in the calibration the model was calibrated in a stepwise manner as follows the model was first calibrated for the flow rate followed by sediment tw nh4 no3 couple and po4 3 chl a couple in order in each calibration for the flow rate sediment and tw the relevant model parameters were optimized by minimizing the rmse value between the observed and simulated values at the watershed outlet the model parameters for the two nitrogen species were simultaneously calibrated using the sum of the rmse values normalized by the mean observed values i e the normalized rmse or nrmse for nh4 and no3 as a minimized objective function similarly the parameters associated with po4 3 and chl a were simultaneously calibrated using the sum of the nrmse values for po4 3 and chl a because phosphorous is the most critical limiting nutrient species on the phytoplankton growth hecky and kilham 1988 labry et al 2005 elser et al 2011 and thus the model parameters for po4 3 and chl a have strong mutual influences in the simulation we did not conduct any intensive calibration for the organics and associated water parameters such as bod or dissolved oxygen do as we assumed that these parameters have little influence on the chl a simulation results the study stream was sufficiently shallow observed water depth ranged from 0 67 to 3 59 m such that it was always under oxidizing conditions minimum values of observed and simulated do were 6 4 mg l and 4 3 mg l respectively during the study period therefore the variability of the do may not have a measurable influence on the phytoplankton growth or associated benthic processes such as phosphorous release for the model calibration an automatic calibration procedure was applied using the complex random factorization method box 1965 guin 1968 barco et al 2008 implemented in matlab r2017a mathworks massachusetts usa and coupled with hspf detailed descriptions on the complex random factorization method and its implementation on matlab with repeated running procedure of hspf can be found in supplementary material appendices a and b 2 5 evaluation of model accuracy various indicators were used to evaluate the accuracy of the model including the coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the percent bias pbias and the rmse observation standard deviation ratio rsr defined as follows moriasi et al 2007 6 r 2 n t 1 n s t o t t 1 n s t t 1 n o t n t 1 n s t 2 t 1 n s t 2 n t 1 n o t 2 t 1 n o t 2 2 7 n s e 1 t 1 n o t s t 2 t 1 n o t o m e a n 2 8 p b i a s t 1 n o t s t t 1

value and s t is the simulated value at time t r2 derived from pearson s correlation coefficient ranges from 0 to 1 and the model is considered more accurate as the value of r2 approaches 1 in general a model with an r2 value greater than 0 5 is considered reasonable legates and mccabe 1999 nse is one of the most commonly used indicators for judging the accuracy of a hydrological or water quality model moriasi et al 2007 the range of nse is from to 1 nash and sutcliffe 1970 with the greatest accuracy at 1 percent bias pbias is the average offset of the simulated values with regard to their observed values in percentage gupta et al 1999 as the pbias value approaches 0 the accuracy of the model increases positive and negative values of pbias indicate underestimation and overestimation biases of the model respectively gupta et al 1999 the rsr defines the deviation of the model relative to the variation of the measured values a lower rsr indicates a better model simulation performance moriasi et al 2007 the criteria for the performance ratings very good good satisfactory and unsatisfactory of the pbias rsr and nse values on a monthly time step simulation for the flow sediment nitrogen and phosphorous are given in supplementary materials table s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 parameter sensitivities the sensitivities and the calibrated values of the model parameters selected for the model calibration are summarized in tables 1 3 a total of 62 parameters were selected for the model calibration based on their sensitivities for the rmse values for the flow rate or water quality variables the remaining 25 model parameters were found to be less sensitive and were therefore not further considered for the model calibration table 1 summarizes the results of sensitivity analysis and model calibration for the parameters associated with hydrology sediment and water temperature among the 10 hydrological parameters those associated with the recession rates of groundwater and interflow agwrc and irc the lower zone storage lzsn and infiltration capacity of the soil infilt showed greater influence on the simulated stream flow than the other parameters although most of the 14 selected sediment parameters table 1 were moderately sensitive to the sediment simulation in the stream slh 10 those incorporated in the wash off equation kser jser keim and jeim and the detachment equation jrer showed greater sensitivities compared to the other parameters in the simulation of water temperature the temperature of ground tgrnd and the heat conductance coefficient kmud showed the highest sensitivity the long wave radiation coefficient katrad was also significantly influential table 2 summarizes the results of sensitivity analysis and model calibration with respect to ammonia nh3 nh4 and nitrate no3 the most sensitive parameter for nh4 n concentration was the unit oxidation rate of total ammonia at 20 c ktam20 the major sensitive parameters for nitrogen species were the concentration of ammonia or nitrate in active groundwater outflow aoqc the accumulation rate of ammonia or nitrate in impervious surfaces implnd acqop the maximum storage of ammonia or nitrate in impervious surfaces implnd sqolim and the rate of surface runoff of ammonia or nitrate in impervious surfaces implnd wsqop the unit denitrification rate kno230 was minimally sensitive for the no3 n concentration because the stream was always under oxidizing conditions during the simulation period table 3 summarizes the results of sensitivity analysis and model calibration with respect to phosphate po4 3 and chl a the main influencing parameters on the po4 p concentration were the wash off potency factors in pervious and impervious land surfaces potfw followed by the upper limit of water temperature for the phytoplankton growth talgrh and the benthic release rate of ortho phosphate under aerobic conditions brpo41 however the benthic release rate of ortho phosphate under anaerobic conditions brop42 was not considered for calibration because it was insensitive under the oxidizing conditions maintained throughout the study period the main influencing parameters on the chl a concentration were the maximal unit growth rate of phytoplankton malgr the rate of phytoplankton settling physet and the ratio of chl a content of biomass to phosphorous content ratclp the three temperature parameters talgrh talgrl and talgrm determining the maximum growth rate of phytoplankton showed moderate or minimal influences on the chl a concentration probably due to the limitation of the linear temperature growth formulation of hspf in simulating the excessive increase in the phytoplankton population at high temperature ranges the results of the sensitivity rankings of all the model parameters are provided in supplementary materials tables s7 8 3 2 instream calibration of the model fig 4 shows the simulation results of the calibrated model graphically comparing the observed and simulated flow rates tw and concentrations of sediment nh4 n no3 n po4 p and chl a in the flow and tw simulation the measured values and simulated values are well fitted the peak flow rates are also well matched between the observed and simulated values the simulated sediment concentrations tss closely agreed with the measured values during the calibration period whereas they tended to be lower than the observed values during the spring seasons particularly in the validation period with relatively lower precipitations and flow rates compared to the calibration period the high tss concentration observed during the spring season that was not properly simulated by the model might be due to the unidentified sources of sediment soil in streams generated from season specific rice farming activities in the study area in korea paddy field farming is the typical method of rice growing and requires large quantities of water for irrigation during the spring seasons this results in discharge of the overflowing irrigation water with entrained pollutants including particles song et al 2013 the simulated nh4 n and no3 n concentrations closely followed the seasonal patterns of the measured values concentrations of the nitrogen species were generally higher during winter seasons which was coincidence with the seasonality of the effluent tn concentrations of the wastewater treatment plants the concentration of nh4 n was remarkably higher during the winter season than during non winter seasons with nh4 n concentration maintained at a very low level 0 05 mg l in contrast the seasonality of no3 n concentration was less significant and generally higher than nh4 n concentration throughout all seasons in the hspf model the difference in the seasonal variation between nh4 n and no3 n was reproduced by allowing monthly variable concentration parameters in the active groundwater aoqc the pollutant accumulation and wash off coefficients in the catchment were assumed to be temporarily constant and thus any possible seasonality in atmospheric deposition were not considered in the simulation the calibration results showed that nitrate concentration in the active groundwater aoqc was maintained between 2 1 3 5 mg l functioning as an effective supplier of nitrate to the stream this result is supported by the nitrate contamination of the groundwater frequently reported in asian agricultural areas including korea jeon et al 2011 liu et al 2017 by comparing the simulation results with and without phytoplankton processes the seasonality and concentrations of nitrogen species were not found to be significantly affected by the time varying phytoplankton growth rate because nitrogen generally was less limited for the phytoplankton growth in the stream water of the study site average tn tp molar ratio of the observed data 75 16 the redfield ratio the observed and simulated concentrations of po4 p were generally higher during winter seasons than non winter seasons however the seasonality of the po4 p concentration was less profound in the observation than in the simulation the simulated po4 p concentration was near zero during summer seasons whereas the observed po4 p concentration was constantly maintained above the detection limit 0 02 0 05 mg p l during the same seasons this difference in the background level of po4 p between the observation and simulation might be caused by the background phosphorous sources such as atmospheric deposition and soils rocks weathering which were not considered in the model gardner 1990 tipping et al 2014 the influences of active groundwater on the phosphorous concentration in streams can be considered insignificant because of the low mobility of phosphorous in the groundwater holman et al 2008 therefore the surface runoff driven by precipitation can be the major factor affecting the temporal variation of the po4 p inputs to the streams however the larger input of phosphorous during the summer season might not always result in a high instream concentration of phosphorous because phosphorous introduced into streams can be largely consumed by phytoplankton at higher temperature conditions during the season the original hspf model was used to simulate the seasonal trend of chl a predicting higher concentrations during summer but the chl a concentration was generally underestimated throughout the study period hspf simulates only one group of phytoplankton species using a linear temperature growth formulation this becomes its intrinsic limitation in simulating varying growth tendencies of diverse phytoplankton species with different optimal growth temperatures possibly present in surface water bodies the model failed to simulate the base level of chl a during the non summer seasons and the excess level of chl a during the summer seasons 3 3 improvements on the chl a simulation fig 5 compares the observed and simulated concentrations of po4 p and chl a for the three different equations to describe the temperature growth relationship of the phytoplankton the original linear equation and two modifications into quadratic and exponential equations in this study we focused on the accuracy of the model in simulating the excessively high concentrations of chl a occurring in the summer seasons which is the primary management target for water quality managers as shown in fig 5 the exponential equation better simulates the patterns of chl a that substantially increase during the summer seasons table 4 summarizes the performance of the model in predicting the trophic states of the water based on the eutrophic state criteria chl a 20 μg l carlson 1996 the linear and exponential equations showed the same prediction accuracy of 84 and 92 for the eutrophic and oligo mesotrophic states respectively in calibration while the exponential equation outperformed the linear equation in predicting both trophic states the performance of quadratic equation was always less than that of linear and exponential equations the exponential equation was especially useful in simulating the summer seasons with high concentrations of chl a 3 4 performance of the calibrated model table 5 shows a summary of the four different accuracy indicators computed for different constituents simulated by the hspf model similarly to prior studies he and hogue 2012 stern et al 2016 the model showed relatively good performance for flow and tw based on all the indicators being within their satisfactory ranges r2 0 7 nse 0 7 pbias 15 71 25 14 and psr 0 53 for the sediment all indicator values of the calibration period were satisfactory or better while the accuracy indicators of the validation period were relatively poor except for pbias the values of pbias for all variables were within the satisfactory performance ranges in both the calibration and validation periods several previous studies reporting the values of r2 or nse on the sediment could be found in the literature table s9 ranging from 0 37 to 0 94 for r2 from daily or monthly calibration and from 3 51 to 0 92 for nse from monthly calibration saleh et al 2000 santhi et al 2001 saleh and du 2004 bracmort et al 2006 stern et al 2016 ahn and kim 2016 no reported values of daily basis nse for sediment were found in the literature while the accuracy of the sediment simulation of this study was comparable to that of the previous studies the accuracy for the validation period was relatively low the relatively low precipitation in the validation period resulted in low simulated tss concentrations in the stream increasing the deviation from the high tss concentration observed in the spring seasons may be a result from the discharge of the paddy fields as mentioned previously see fig 3 the values of r2 nse and rsr for nitrogen species po4 p and chl a were generally within the ranges of unsatisfactory performance ratings while the performance ratings based on pbias were satisfactory or better for all constituents and simulation periods calibration and validation however the indicator values in this study were comparable to those in the previous studies table s9 considering that the temporal resolutions 5 8 days used in this study were finer than those used in most of the previous studies in which monthly calibrations were used when the indicator values were recalculated using monthly averaged data the values in the parenthesis in table 5 the accuracies generally improved furthermore most of the previous studies rated the model performance targeting lumped sum variables e g tn tp or a sum of organic n and no3 n which may generally result in better model performance ratings compared to this study targeting a single species e g no3 n or po4 p moriasi et al 2007 no previous studies reported the accuracy indicators of nh4 and chl a as show in table 5 the exponential temperature growth model was slightly better in simulating the chl a concentration when considering the values of r2 relatively high in both the calibration and validation steps however the linear temperature growth model outperformed the exponential temperature growth model in the calibration step based on the nse values the monthly values of nse were 0 37 and 0 29 for the linear and exponential temperature growth models respectively however it should be noted that the exponential temperature growth model could be more valuable for simulating the excess growth of phytoplankton during summer seasons 4 conclusions this study offered an improved accuracy of the instream chl a simulation in the hspf model using an automatic calibration and modification on the chl a calculation module important model parameters were selected from senstivity analyses and then automatically calibrated from this study the following conclusions are made 1 sets of crucial hspf model parameters for flow water temperature sediment ionic nutrient species and chl a were drawn through the lh oat sensitivity analysis which were selected as the parameters to be automatically calibrated by the complex random factorization algorithm the suggested crucial parameter sets can be used as guidance for other watershed modeling applications with different site specific conditions 2 the complex random factorization algorithm was applied in a stepwise manner for different parameter groups and was effective in automatically calibrating the hspf model which is intrinsically difficult and thus no attempts have been made in pervious studies 3 the performance ratings of the calibrated model with 5 8 day interval time series data were better than or equal to the satisfactory levels for individual ionic nutrient species and chl a the obtained performance ratings were fairly comparable with those in the literature which were mostly based on monthly calibration or based on gross nutrient parameters such as total nitrogen and total phosphorous no chl a calibration reports were found in the existing hspf modeling literature 4 among the three formulations of the temperature growth relationship of phytoplankton the exponential equation was more efficient than the original linear equation or the quadratic equation in simulating excess growth of phytoplankton during summer seasons this study demonstrated how the extremely large number of model parameters of a sophisticated watershed model such as hspf can be managed to ensure the model s validity it also demonstrated how the critical modification on the phytoplankton growth formulation can improve the chl a simulation as a future study coupling such model with remote sensing of chl a could improve our understanding the dynamics of algal blooms the improved chl a simulation using the approach suggested in this study coupled with remote sensing modeling in the future should be useful for early warning of algal blooms and help decision makers in developing proactive management plans acknowledgements this work was supported by the research program of dongguk university 2018 and grants from

24947,in recent years the use of ecological niche models enms and species distribution models sdms to explore the patterns and processes behind observed distribution of species has experienced an explosive growth although the use of these methods has been less common and more recent in marine ecosystems than in a terrestrial context they have shown significant increases in use and applications herein we provide a systematic review of 328 articles on marine enms and sdms published between 1990 and 2016 aiming to identify their main applications and the diversity of methodological frameworks in which they are developed including spatial scale geographic realm taxonomic groups assessed algorithms implemented and data sources of the 328 studies 48 were at local scales with a hotspot of research effort in the north atlantic ocean most studies were based on correlative approaches and were used to answer ecological or biogeographic questions about mechanisms underlying geographic ranges 64 a few attempted to evaluate impacts of climate change 19 or to develop strategies for conservation 11 several correlative techniques have been used but most common was the machine learning approach maxent 46 and statistical approaches such as generalized additive models gams 22 and generalized linear models glms 14 the groups most studied were fish 23 molluscs 16 and marine mammals 14 the first two with commercial importance and the last important for conservation we noted a lack of clarity regarding the definitions of enms versus sdms and a rather consistent failure to differentiate between them this review exposed a need to know reduce and report error and uncertainty associated with species occurrence records and environmental data in addition particular to marine realms a third dimension should be incorporated into the modelling process referring to the vertical position of the species which will improve the precision and utility of these models so too is of paramount importance the consideration of temporal and spatial resolution of environmental layers to adequately represent the dynamic nature of marine ecosystems especially in the case of highly mobile species keywords biogeography coastal correlative modelling geographic distribution ocean process based modelling sea suitability 1 introduction ecological niche models enms and species distribution models sdms are commonly used in theoretical and applied studies in ecology and biogeography peterson et al 2015 among the most common applications are determining suitable sites for species guisan and zimmermann 2000 predicting impacts of future climate change on species distributions pearson and dawson 2003 evaluating the invasive potential of non native species jiménez valverde et al 2011 and conservation planning guisan et al 2013 three main categories of models are recognized in this field correlative models the most common in the literature which estimate the ecological requirements of species by relating their known geographic distributions to a set of environmental variables araújo and guisan 2006 franklin 2009 mechanistic models that use detailed physiological information and first principles of biophysics kearney and porter 2009 and process oriented models which estimate distributions of species in terms of processes including dispersal capability and biotic interactions peterson et al 2015 throughout the history of modelling species niches and distributions such models have received a variety of names bioclimatic envelope models araújo and peterson 2012 habitat suitability models hirzel et al 2006 species distribution models elith and leathwick 2009 and ecological niche models peterson 2006 this panoply of terms has led to confusion and sometimes misinterpretation of model results peterson and soberón 2012 soberón et al 2017 more recently two terms for two kinds of models has gained attention acceptance is growing for the terms enm and sdm as two distinct approaches to answering different questions peterson and soberón 2012 enms estimate fundamental niches of species and are applied when the aim is to know the potential distribution as in the case of invasive species or projections in space and time on the other hand sdms attempt to estimate objects in geographic space referring to actual distributions of species peterson and soberón 2012 soberón et al 2017 implementation of enms and sdms started with terrestrial species with increasing numbers of publications each year robinson et al 2011 their application to marine species has been less frequent however niche models applied to marine systems have become more popular in recent years fig 1 robinson et al 2017 modelling marine species may be a challenge owing to the particular physical and biological characteristics of marine habitats and species robinson et al 2011 one of the main challenges is the three dimensionality of marine habitats especially when modelling pelagic species living in the middle layers of the water column dambach and rödder 2011 bentlage et al 2013 this challenge is mainly imposed by the fact that most available environmental data layers describe the uppermost layers or the ocean floor assis et al 2017a and because of the limited knowledge of many pelagic organisms ecology and behavior bentlage et al 2013 another important challenge is the dynamic nature of marine ecosystems and the multiple spatial and temporal scales in which species environment relationships occurs redfern et al 2006 scales et al 2017 this dynamism is essential in the case of highly mobile species for which transitory environmental conditions may determine distribution over short time frames fernandez et al 2017 2018 another particularity is the lack of hard physical barriers to dispersal for most marine organisms dispersal depends upon ocean currents so the inclusion of ocean currents in the models or taking species dispersal into account should enhance the development of more reliable models dambach and rödder 2011 previous efforts to summarize the state on the field of enm and sdm in the marine realm include the works of dambach and rödder 2011 and robinson et al 2011 who provided overviews of marine niche modelling applications and highlighted the particular challenges in modelling marine environments such as three dimensionality species interactions and ontogenetic shifts vierod et al 2014 reviewed applications of niche models in deep sea ecosystems that are considered vulnerable pointing out data limitations and implications of model predictions and paying special attention to sampling bias spatial autocorrelation spatial scale and model evaluation and validation issues of paramount importance that are still under discussion in the field of modelling marshall et al 2014 analyzed the use of these models in planning marine conservation they highlighted the fact that in most cases models related to marine ecosystems are not linked to management decisions and about the need to use these models into spatial prioritization programs moreover they recommend the use of models in combination with layers of human footprint to add value to the models for conservation purposes marcelino and verbruggen 2015 reviewed the use of these techniques to model invasive seaweeds and pointed out some particularities when modelling invasive species such as the assumption that those species are in equilibrium with its environment and about the fact that they retain their ecological niche most recently robinson et al 2017 reviewed applications of marine models and developed a framework to guide future applications through the use of a flow diagram to guide the process towards model implementation calibration and validation this review aims to answer key questions related to use of enms and sdms in marine ecosystems on the basis of 328 research articles published on the topic between 1990 and 2016 for most cases both enms and sdms are herein referred to as models except when we want to emphasize differences between them this is the most comprehensive review yet compiled for marine environments as it includes information from previous reviews plus new additions that have not been summarized previously here we summarize applications of the models and the taxa that have been targets of modelling studies we identify gaps in modelling of marine species and point out emerging trends in the field we consider aspects of modelling that are specific to marine environments 2 ecological niche concepts in enms and sdms species distribution modelling and ecological niche modelling rely on ecological niche theory the ecological niche of a species was originally defined as the suite of ecological conditions within which a species is capable of surviving and reproducing without immigrational subsidy grinnell 1917 later the term was recycled to refer to the functional role that a species plays in a community elton 1927 still later distinction was drawn between the fundamental niche the set of abiotic environmental conditions under which a species is able to persist indefinitely and the realized niche the part of the fundamental niche that is constrained by interactions with other species hutchinson 1957 as such species ranges can be conceived of as a consequence of three factors soberón and peterson 2005 i presence of environmental abiotic conditions under which the species can establish survive and reproduce ii the biotic environment determined by the presence of species interactions such as competition or predation in which species can persist and iii the area that is accessible to the species via its movement or dispersal capabilities these restrictions have been captured in the so called bam diagram fig 2 a b biotic a abiotic m movement soberón and peterson 2005 which has become a central concern in designing models barve et al 2011 saupe et al 2012 species geographic ranges are the result of the dynamic interactions of those three factors in niche modelling inclusion of b presents a problem owing to the complexity of biotic interactions and estimation of m is a complex challenge since it involves knowledge of areas that have been accessible to the species over relevant time periods barve et al 2011 hence most correlative models have been restricted to representations of a peterson et al 2011 presented the eltonian noise hypothesis which is the idea that biotic interactions seldom constitute a significant constraint on the distributional potential of species on large geographic extents and low resolutions this is also a hypothesis about biological processes and represents a simplification of modelling methodologies considering the difficulties to include biotic interactions in the process biotic interactions are hard to measure and represent in a raster grid format soberón and nakamura 2009 for some species ecological interactions may not play a dominant role at the coarse resolution typically used for modelling and niche models have demonstrated a good performance in describing their distribution on the basis of a costa et al 2010 lira noriega et al 2013 conversely for some species it has been demonstrated that accounting for biotic interactions improves model capability at predicting their distributions de araújo et al 2014 another important concept in niche theory applied to niche and distribution models is the so called hutchinson s duality which refers to the correspondence between niche i e environmental or ecological and geographic i e distributional spaces fig 2 b and d according to this hypothesis a region of the niche space may correspond to more than one place in the geographic space whereas each point in the geographic space corresponds to exactly one point in niche space colwell and rangel 2009 this hypothesis is of great utility for explaining the differences between enms and sdms concepts which mistakenly are often termed as equivalent peterson and soberón 2012 for practical considerations sdm refers to the modelling objects in g space whereas enm refers to modelling objects in e space soberón et al 2017 enm requires an explicit estimation of the species fundamental niche and are intended to model the processes that shape the area of distribution of the species and frequently used to transfer those causal factors into projections in space or time peterson and soberón 2012 sdm can only focus on the species distribution and ideally must restrict model calibration to accessible areas m account for true absences and incorporate dispersal and colonization capabilities peterson and soberón 2012 it is clear that there is an intimate relationship between these two concepts and delimiting one or the other may be confusing but in order to let the field grow it is important to be consistent and rigorous with the use of the terminology 3 literature search and analysis 3 1 literature search using the isi web of science and scopus databases we performed an exhaustive literature search using the keywords species distribution models habitat suitability models ecological niche models and bioclimatic envelope models each accompanied successively by the words sea marine and ocean the initial search restricted to articles published during 1990 2016 yielded more than 2000 articles we discarded articles that did not make explicit reference to modelling species distributions or ecological niches in a grinnellian sense soberón 2007 and those focused on biotic interactions e g studies of trophic niches articles regarding mangrove ecosystems were also discarded though we included studies of marine species able to live in estuaries and rivers additionally we searched the references sections of each article for relevant publications that might not have been detected in the initial search in total 328 articles were selected to be included in this review appendix a 3 2 summary of information each article was entered in a database with author s publication year study region and the following fields 3 2 1 extent of analysis in order to know the analytical extent of the studies these were classified as locals if they cover the territory of one country or less e g portuguese coast as regionals for two or more countries e g mediterranean sea and global if they were accomplished worldwide 3 2 2 taxonomic group the classification of target species by taxonomic group did not focus on a particular taxonomic category to illustrate the great variety of organisms studied thus categories include phylum subphylum and class and less formal groups such as seaweed for the purpose of this review elasmobranch is taken as a group separated from the category fish which includes the actinopterygii class 3 2 3 source of occurrence data and environmental variables we registered sources of occurrences data and environmental variables in modelling studies we also recorded the environmental variables used in each study e g wind velocity water temperature 3 2 4 type of model and modelling technique we classified the studies as correlative mechanistic or process oriented since most studies were correlative we further classified all articles depending on the modelling technique that they used e g maxent glm enfa 3 2 5 model selection and validation in order to know how model selection and validation is done we registered the procedures e g cross validation and metrics e g auc tss used in each article 3 2 6 aim of the studies studies were classified according to 9 topic categories present potential distribution climate change impacts invasive species distributions under past climates abundance models populations and communities habitat use evaluation of methods conservation planning and management and other the latter category includes testing niche conservatism evolution or niche reconstruction and review articles articles addressing more than one research question were assigned to several categories if necessary finally in order to enlighten the geographic distribution of enm and sdm efforts the study area described in each article was digitized with gis software using as a reference a 1 spatial resolution global grid we extended this spatial representation to the modelling purposes and the taxonomic groups studied in the articles 4 enms and sdms in the marine realm to our knowledge this review of 328 articles is the most extensive overview of applications of sdm and enm in the marine realm we found a great variety of applications species being modelled environments being studied and a broad geographic distribution of studies below we attempt to describe the main findings of the literature reviewed 4 1 regions studied and extent of analysis each ocean was covered by at least 39 modelling exercises research in marine systems most frequently concerned the north atlantic ocean hotspots of studies were along the northeastern coast of the united states the west coast of europe and the mediterranean sea fig 3 the least studied areas were the northwestern pacific ocean and the indian ocean models have been used in all marine ecoregions see also robinson et al 2017 with clear interest in the north atlantic ocean local studies predominated followed by regional studies only a few studies were at global scales fig 4 4 2 taxonomic groups in marine modelling diverse marine taxonomic groups have been studied using enms or sdms studies of fish and molluscs were most common 77 and 52 articles respectively fig 4 this concentration could be explained by the commercial importance that fisheries of those groups represent worldwide according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao in 2015 fish and molluscs occupied first and second places respectively in global capture production in marine fishing areas fao 2017 most of the articles concerning these groups targeted commercial species such as anchovy and jack fish and abalone and clams a third group of importance in modelling were mammals n 48 which are among the most threatened species facing severe population declines reeves et al 2013 mainly owing to bycatch fisheries and pollution schipper et al 2008 as well as ship strikes and noise disturbance aguilar de soto et al 2016 pirotta et al 2019 which now are recognized as major threats to marine mammals hence they are attractive for this kind of study another reason that makes these three groups suitable for modelling is the amount of data available via the obis portal http www iobis org 20 million records are available for pisces 3 million for mollusca and 1 million for mammalia other taxonomic groups well represented among the articles reviewed here were seaweed n 34 crustaceans n 29 seabirds n 28 and stony corals n 25 for seaweed target species were mainly invasive and crustacean included several economically important groups such as lobsters seabirds had a special interest for conservation as well as stony corals since their ecological importance like habitat forming species seagrasses are among the least studied groups n 10 even though they provide key ecological services and there is a growing need for protection and conservation in the face of global threats orth et al 2006 two studies predicted the potential distribution and habitat suitability for the seagrasses zostera noltii and z marina valle et al 2011 downie et al 2013 yet we found just one article evaluating the impact of rising seawater temperatures and sea level rise on the distribution of z noltii valle et al 2014 other important habitat forming species that have received little attention are kelp forests and algae but apparently they are receiving more attention since we found recent publications regarding kelp forests assis et al 2018 2017a algae forest from the genus cystoseira buonomo et al 2018 and for the seagrass cymodocea nodosa and posidonia oceanica chefaoui et al 2018 chefaoui and serrão 2017 other poorly represented groups were sponges foraminifera reptiles n 9 each tunicates n 7 and bacteria n 2 something worth mentioning is that we did not find articles regarding the study of viruses during years for which we conducted our review however a more recent article applies enm to study the ecology and epidemiology of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus of fish escobar et al 2018 the study of marine diseases was less represented in the analyzed articles nevertheless we think that distribution and niche models can help to better understand the complicated dynamic of epidemiological and diseases processes in the marine realm in the category reptiles only turtles were found in the literature reviewed which reflects the paucity of marine reptiles in comparison with fishes but reptiles are probably receiving more attention since the recent publication of an article on niche modelling of sea kraits gherghel et al 2018 other cnidarians includes jellyfishes anemones black and red corals the class hydrozoa and the extinct coral grewingkia all of these groups were much less represented in the literature other invertebrates includes the phyla bryozoa placozoa entoprocta nematoda platyhelminthes and xenacoelomorpha the class priapulida and the extinct class trilobita many articles n 50 included multiple taxonomic groups 4 3 spatial patterns by taxonomic group we found a strong interest in fish molluscs crustaceans annelids seaweed and sea grasses in western europe and mediterranean sea fig 5 fig b1 in appendix b elasmobranch studies were more common in the gulf of mexico and near the united kingdom plankton studies were concentrated in the north atlantic ocean mammals in the eastern pacific ocean and echinoderms in the southwestern pacific ocean studies of seabirds were spread more globally but with a marked interest in the southern ocean 4 4 occurrence data for modelling one of the most important inputs for model construction is occurrence data which provide information about environmental conditions where the species is present and thereby allow estimation of niches via correlative methods the occurrence data used in the reviewed literature fig 6 most commonly came from regional databases n 121 and field censuses n 119 other sources included published literature n 91 global databases n 61 and scientific collections n 20 it was relatively common for studies to combine different sources especially for poorly known species global initiatives that provide open access to occurrence data include the global biodiversity information facility gbif https www gbif org ocean biogeographic information system obis http www iobis org fishbase https www fishbase de fishnet2 http www fishnet2 net and d4science infrastructure https www d4science org home other data sources are more specialized in particular taxa such as the microbis database from the international census of marine microbes icomm https vamps mbl edu portals icomm icomm php microbis and the global diatom database leblanc et al 2012 example of regional efforts to compile accessible information on occurrences is the continuous plankton recorder survey cpr https www cprsurvey org in association with the marine biological association of the uk which holds historical data about biogeography and ecology of plankton from the north atlantic and the north sea helaouët and beaugrand 2009 chust et al 2014 barton et al 2016 brun et al 2016 another example is the north atlantic right whale consortium https www narwc org that records historical sightings of right whales and other mammals sea turtles and large fish from the north atlantic ocean gowan and ortega ortiz 2014 alternative regional sources of occurrence data include commercial or recreational fisheries logbooks brodie et al 2015 gomez et al 2015 and programs for assessment of fishing activity and stock conditions maxwell et al 2009 tanaka and chen 2016 among the latter the international bottom trawl survey in the mediterranean medits http jadran izor hr eng international medits html is a program that conducts continuous trawl surveys to assess the status of fishing resources to support the policies and regulation of fisheries in the mediterranean such data besides providing information about occurrences may also inform about their relative abundance and thereby enable models aimed at studying effects of climate change on fish stocks for instance researchers have applied generalized linear and additive models to integrate swordfish xiphias gladius and common sardine strangomera bentincki fisheries data with simulations of future sea surface temperatures to predict changes in their relative abundance and distribution off the coast of chile silva et al 2015 censuses were the second most common source occurrence data since most studies were at local scales researchers can generate their own data we found a variety of survey methods including visual surveys pittman et al 2007 assis et al 2015 and underwater video systems especially for demersal species moore et al 2009 2016 monk et al 2010 mclean et al 2016 another common source was satellite tracking data commonly used for sea turtles pikesley et al 2015 varo cruz et al 2016 whittock et al 2016 seabirds skov et al 2008 catry et al 2013 ramos et al 2015 and mammals edrén et al 2010 information from natural history museums and scientific collections is another valuable source of primary data examples include the south australian museum http www samuseum sa gov au collections bentlage et al 2009 museo nacional de historia natural at montevideo uruguay http www mnhn gub uy innovaportal v 3090 12 mecweb colecciones leftmenuid 3090 carranza et al 2011 and the u s national museum of natural history https naturalhistory si edu rc georgian et al 2014 occurrence databases frequently include important geographic biases such as inaccurate geolocation and spatial autocorrelation among occurrence points as well as species misidentifications as with terrestrial ecosystems it is common that certain marine areas are more visited than others because of their proximity or low cost accessibility which results in oversampling biases that turn into biases in the ecological niche space araújo and guisan 2006 also see fig 2 all modelling algorithms assume that occurrence data are unbiased araújo and guisan 2006 yet in reality they are sensitive to many characteristics of the occurrence data araújo and guisan 2006 loiselle et al 2008 fourcade et al 2014 these biases can lead to model overfitting to environmental conditions associated with particular geographic spaces producing poorly reliable models araújo and guisan 2006 boria et al 2014 and also impact model evaluation since in most cases there is no independent data to perform the test a common practice is to randomly split occurrence data into training and testing subsets despite both subsets keep sharing the same bias and may show an inflated metric for validation veloz 2009 these remarks regarding biases and other problems associated to species occurrences are particularly important for pelagic and deep water species that are hard to sample and consequently data poor users and designers of occurrences databases must be aware of errors associated with this type of data acknowledging potential impacts on model performance while also submitting occurrence data to exhaustive procedure of data cleaning peterson et al 2011 and ideally by making specific mentions about data quality in metadata files at the time of making the data available 4 5 environmental data for modelling recent technological developments have enabled access to increasing amounts of environmental information derived from remotely sensed data at high spatial resolutions through data interpolation or from modelled data as with many climate data products we found four main sources of environmental information global data bases providing environmental parameters for whole oceans information generated by the authors through either field measurements or computational methods regional databases and in some cases published information fig 7 global databases were by far the most common n 239 among data portals most frequently used were the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa other data were accessed through the ocean color web https oceancolor gsfc nasa gov

by the european commission and offers products describing the physical and biogeochemical state of the global ocean and european regional seas the most cited source for bathymetric data was the general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco https www gebco net which offers a 15 arc second resolution grid for the global ocean an example of a regional database is the australian bureau of meteorology consulted by adams et al 2015 to obtain data on wind speed and direction and solar exposure with the goal of identifying environmental factors limiting seagrass survival in moreton bay australia sarà et al 2013 used hourly seawater temperature data from the italian oceanographic buoy network at the instituto superiore per la protezione e la ricerca ambientale to generate a mechanistic model of fitness and potential colonization areas for the invasive mussel brachidontes pharaonis in the italian portion of the mediterranean finally carlucci et al 2016 used bathymetric data from the european marine observation and data network emodnet http www emodnet eu what emodnet to assess driving forces influencing the distribution of dolphin species in the gulf of taranto generation of environmental variables by the authors themselves was not common however one example is the use of multibeam echosounder systems to produce bathymetric data howell et al 2011 monk et al 2011 gonzález irusta et al 2015 piechaud et al 2015 selection of key environmental variables in which to explore the niche of species is a crucial step in model design inclusion of too many environmental dimensions can cause model overfitting peterson et al 2007 thus as good practice various biological or statistical criteria are used to select the best set of environmental predictors principal components analysis pca is the most commonly used to reduce dimensionality of environmental spaces dennis and hellberg 2010 freeman et al 2013 escobar et al 2015 another common procedure for variable selection involves the estimation of correlation among candidate variables combined with the results of a jackknife analysis performed in maxent under this method variable selection obeys low collinearity and high contribution values raghavan et al 2019a b in marine environments the water column creates a three dimensional structure that represents an extra challenge in modelling dambach and rödder 2011 robinson et al 2011 the study of pelagic organisms represents a particular challenge given the difficulties of access and sampling in open oceans bentlage et al 2013 most oceanographic data are representative of the topmost layers of the water column and those representative of the seabed are often derived from bathymetric profiles assis et al 2017a which impedes modelling of pelagic and highly mobile species bentlage et al 2013 modelled the potential distribution of the open ocean jellyfish periphylla periphylla on a global scale they used oceanographic variables woa05 at multiple depths and added the third dimension by transforming and combining all depth layers into a single continuous grid two dimensional that replicated global oceans multiple times as such the model encompassed the whole environmental range occupied by the species in three dimensions duffy and chown 2017 used similar approaches to estimate the probability of occurrence of four fish species in the northeastern atlantic highlighting the importance of explicit consideration of the vertical dimension the temporal resolution of environmental layers is important especially in the case of highly mobile species since their distributions may be associated with both short and long term variability in ocean environments fernandez et al 2017 mannocci et al 2017 in the literature reviewed here little attention was paid to this point and the use of variables appeared more related to availability than to detailed analysis of impacts of temporal resolution on distributions of target species an exception is the work of scales et al 2016 who used remotely sensed environmental variables that temporally matched with tracking data for the grey headed albatross thalassarche chrysostoma to identify foraging areas fortunately it seems that this field is gaining attention among the modelling community since contributions addressing this topic although mainly focusing on mammals have been recently published it has been found that finer temporal scales may provide more accurate models especially for species such as blue fin and sei whales that are highly dependent on dynamic variables fernandez et al 2018 other studies regarding the spatio temporal variability and habitat dynamism for modelling the distribution of blue whales in the azores islands and the california coast in usa highlighted the utility of multiscale studies to capture the factors that affect the distribution of this highly migratory species abrahms et al 2019 gonzález garcía et al 2018 these contributions have been important to understand how species make use of or shift among dynamic habitats and to reinforce the importance of such models for conservation strategies influences of data quality on model performance have been investigated for marine systems becker et al 2016 compared the performance of two cetacean density models one built with oceanographic information and the other with data measured in situ they found no significant differences in the metrics evaluated suggesting that modelled data which are considerably easier and less costly to assemble can support modelling efforts adequately to assess effects of spatial resolution on model predictions basher et al 2014 modelled distributions of shrimp species in the ross sea they found that spatial resolution influences both the extent of the resulting suitable area and the relative importance of environmental variables a great diversity of variables was used to describe species niches including physical and chemical properties of the water column topographic characteristics of the seabed factors describing the surrounding environments and variables related to biotic interactions table c1 appendix c the most common descriptor used was water temperature which was used in 240 of the articles reviewed temperature is among the most important determinants of species distributions and as a single environmental covariate can predict 53 99 of present day biogeographic units along coastlines belanger et al 2012 other physical variables included photosynthetically active radiation par n 26 and diffuse attenuation coefficient n 20 chemical variables included salinity n 147 and chlorophyll a concentration n 97 atmospheric variables included air temperature n 15 and precipitation n 9 environmental descriptors included sediment type n 30 and substrate bottom type n 27 geographic variables included distance to shore n 54 and geographic coordinates n 20 hydrodynamic variables included current velocity n 45 and mixed layer depth n 15 topographic variables included bathymetry n 210 and slope n 109 ecological variables included habitat type n 11 and presence absence biomass of other species n 7 finally temporal variables included season of the year n 7 and calendar year n 4 4 6 model types 4 6 1 correlative models correlative modelling was far more frequent than mechanistic or process oriented approaches it usually begins with the known distribution of species namely presence presence absence or abundance data which are associated statistically with environmental variables describing dimensions such as climate kearney 2006 peterson et al 2015 its popularity is thanks partly to advances in statistical techniques development of gis tools and availability of specialized modelling software and also to growing availability of detailed data about biodiversity and the environment elith and leathwick 2009 peterson et al 2015 in our review 307 of the articles were exclusively correlative associations so the general tendencies described above represent the main currents in correlative modelling in largest part thus the main focus of this section is on description of methods used in correlative models models differ in the way they select environmental predictors and measure variable contributions and predictive performance elith et al 2006 but they have in common the goal of describing one part of environmental space as suitable and the rest of that space as unsuitable in the earliest marine models reilly 1990 applied analysis of variance to explore relationships between water mass properties density and thermocline depth and seasonal distributions of dolphin groups in the eastern tropical pacific fiedler and reilly 1994 and reilly and fiedler 1994 used canonical correspondence analysis cca to study respectively habitat use and the relationship of dolphin abundance to habitat quality more recently a great variety of methods has been used for modelling species niches and distributions franklin 2009 in our review most popular methods were machine learning methods n 268 followed by statistical methods n 189 and finally similarity based and expert rule approaches n 54 74 studies used a combination of two or more techniques among machine learning methods maxent phillips et al 2006 was most frequent n 147 fig 8 since the appearance of maxent in 2006 it became one of the most popular modelling techniques perhaps partly because it requires relatively little information being designed to work with presence only data phillips et al 2006 maxent has shown robust predictive accuracy elith et al 2006 graham et al 2008 even with small sample sizes hernandez et al 2006 wisz et al 2008 and provides great flexibility in model construction through a friendly interface e g features and regularization multiplier that allow the user to adjust the model to specific needs and available information merow et al 2013 muscarella et al 2014 other well represented machine learning methods have been boosted regression trees brt n 38 and random forests rf n 26 in the case of statistical methods most frequent were regression models i e gams n 70 and glms n 47 fig 8 among similarity based and expert rule models most frequent was the ecological niche factor analysis enfa n 27 fig 8 in spite of their applicability and overall quality or popularity in the field of correlative modelling it is has been recognized that there is no single best algorithm and it is recommended as a good practice to test and justify a suit of algorithms in order to choose the best option for a particular research question qiao et al 2015 4 6 2 mechanistic models mechanistic models use detailed physiological information and first principles of mathematical reasoning to determine links between the environment and the fitness of the organism which is later represented in geographic space kearney 2006 kearney and porter 2009 peterson et al 2015 in our review only 13 articles used mechanistic approaches dynamic energy budget deb models used chlorophyll a to express food availability and water temperature to express body temperature to study relative fitness of native and invasive molluscs this approach generated spatial predictions of their physiological performance and highlighted potential areas for colonization sarà et al 2013 montalto et al 2015 mechanistic niche models have been used to integrate solar radiation salinity and temperature in models designed to evaluate the invasive potential of the ascidian ciona intestinalis and the seaweed codium fragile madariaga et al 2014 other studies have assessed future changes in distributions of planktonic organisms in response to rising temperatures helaouët and beaugrand 2009 thomas et al 2012 other mechanistic niche models explicitly incorporate correlative approaches for instance fordham et al 2013a 2013b modelled the future ranges and abundance of two harvested abalone species haliotis rubra and h laevigata combining demographic processes and physiological responses with climatic factors other studies have used thermal thresholds of macroalgae to predict potential range shifts in response to global warming martínez et al 2014 or have simulated effects of temperature and oxygen concentrations on growth and body weight in fish and invertebrates to predict patterns of change in species richness invasion and extinction worldwide jones and cheung 2014 for two ecologically and economically important mussels mytilus edulis and m galloprovincialis energetic responses to temperature were analysed to understand current and future potential distributions fly et al 2015 4 6 3 process oriented models dynamic models can take into account key processes that affect ranges of species through effects on demographic processes such as birth and death rates and dispersal of individuals case et al 2005 holt and keitt 2005 process oriented models can measure effects of these processes across species distributions peterson et al 2015 in this review only five of the articles included process oriented modelling almost all focused on molluscs and related to their dispersal capabilities process oriented models can be combined with correlative approaches among the articles reviewed the earliest process oriented model inglis et al 2006 examined the utility of habitat suitability index models and particle dispersion models to project suitable habitat for the non native bivalves theora lubrica and musculista senhousia in new zealand for m galloprovincialis which is invasive in southern africa assis et al 2015 combined niche modelling and lagrangian particle simulations to assess its current distribution and evaluate effects of dispersal capacity and environment as controls on its potential to spread in the bay of santander spain bidegain et al 2013 combined niche modelling with a particle tracking model to study larval transport supply settlement behavior and post settlement mortality of the clams ruditapes decussatus and r philippinarum to identify optimal habitat for settlement and assess connectivity between spawning and nursery grounds finally elsäßer et al 2013 combined niche and particle dispersal models to identify suitable areas for adult translocation that could represent restoration sites for biogenic reefs formed by the horse mussel modiolus modiolus in northern ireland in our only example including fish cheung et al 2009 analysed likely effects of climate change on distributions of 1066 commercially exploited marine fish and invertebrates using a dynamic model including environmental variables and simulations of abundances derived from a logistic population growth model 4 7 model selection and validation model selection and validation is a critical step in the model procedure it is the measure of how useful and trustworthy our models are most importantly when the intention is transferring the model to novel conditions wenger and olden 2012 considering only correlative models 224 articles used a cross validation method mostly by randomly dividing occurrence data whereas only 21 used independent test data the most frequent evaluation measure was the threshold independent area under the receiver operating characteristic roc curve auc n 177 followed by the akaike s information criterion aic or aicc n 42 the true skill statistics tss n 35 and the kappa statistic n 26 111 articles combined more than one validation metrics model selection is a debated topic in enm and sdm currently warren and seifert 2011 and newer applications that run maxent and other algorithms have adopted statistical model evaluations and metrics based on information criteria as the standard to choose among all possible combinations of model parameterizations muscarella et al 2014 cobos et al 2019 such approximations to model selection and evaluation represent a more robust protocol while implementing enm and have demonstrated to yield better results than only using default parameters 4 8 enms and sdms applications 4 8 1 current species distribution patterns models are often used to investigate factors that limit species distributions and to fill gaps in information about species ranges in our review 212 of the articles aimed to explore potential distributions of species or to elucidate which environmental factors are responsible for observed patterns most distributional studies concerned fish mammals molluscs or seaweed table 1 for instance enm and sdm have been used to investigate the potential distribution of the harmful cyanobacteria lyngbya majuscula in the canary islands martín garcía et al 2014 and to measure the effect of environmental variables on shaping the distribution of fish species beger and possingham 2008 chatfield et al 2010 for the kelp laminaria hyperborea assis et al 2016b and for commercial cephalopods lauria et al 2015 for several articles a study of the distribution patterns was the first step toward answering more complex questions including topics such as climate change impacts and conservation planning 4 8 2 impacts of future climate change the average global surface temperature of the earth has increased by approximately 0 2 c per decade over the past 30 years hansen et al 2006 more than 90 of the excess heat is absorbed by the ocean driving to a rate of warming of about 0 11 c per decade in the upper layer and an increase in the global mean sea level of 0 19 m and a decrease of seawater ph by 0 1 units in recent decades rhein et al 2013 of the articles reviewed 64 aimed to analyse some aspect of future climate change the most frequent taxa in these studies were fish and molluscs table 1 model scenarios have been used to improve understanding of how climate change may impact marine ecosystems and species most have focused on predicting potential changes of species distributions in response to climate change for example assis et al 2016b used niche modelling to predict consequences of future climate change on the distribution and genetic diversity of the kelp l hyperborea in europe they suggested that changes in environmental conditions may lead to loss of suitability in areas where the species has persisted through time and a possible northward range shift a model of shallow coral reefs worldwide couce et al 2013 assessed potential effects of increasing sea surface temperature and ocean acidification on these ecosystems temperature would be the main driver in the decline of suitability particularly in the indo pacific region and in producing a poleward range expansion of suitable areas 4 8 3 methodological advances in the past two decades use of models has grown rapidly lobo et al 2010 with a concomitant increase in interest in improving their performance of the 328 articles reviewed here however only 41 addressed performance of the models the most frequent way to evaluate performance was to compare the results of multiple techniques in a single scenario for instance jones et al 2012 compared the performance of three different approaches aquamaps maxent and sea around us project algorithms in modelling commercial fish distribution in the north sea and north atlantic bucas et al 2013 compared outcomes of four modelling algorithms gams rf mars and maxent in predicting the distribution and diversity of benthic species in the baltic sea another contribution to methodological advance is ensemble modelling approaches that is results from different algorithms can be combined to produce a more robust model including results from more than one set of model parameters thuiller et al 2009 in the marine realm ensemble models have been used to predict potential distributions of flatback turtles natator depressus whittock et al 2016 future suitability for the barau s petrel pterodroma baraui legrand et al 2016 and impacts of climate change on fish diversity in the mediterranean sea albouy et al 2015 other authors have evaluated transfer capability of models for example lauria et al 2015 evaluated model capacity to spatially predict density of the commercially important norway lobster nephrops norvegicus in fishing areas of the northeast atlantic they found that most of the models were able to successfully predict lobster density among fishing areas suggesting that simple regression models perform as well as complex models in space transferability verbruggen et al 2013 studied the model transfer capability for the invasive seaweed caulerpa cylindracea they found that appropriate predictor selection plays an important role in transferability success projection exercises are a difficult task in the field of modelling because we don t have the capacity to validate that a successful model predicting the actual distribution of species is equally successful in predicting its distribution on novel conditions when projected to new areas or in climate change scenarios it has been shown that when transferring models it is difficult to accurately estimate the existing fundamental niche of species specially when it is not well represented in the calibration area qiao et al 2019 it is also of high importance to evaluate the degree of environmental similarity between calibration and projection regions as well as to make a proper selection of the modelling algorithm considering the completeness in the knowledge of the species fundamental niche qiao et al 2019 despite this model projections represent a valuable tool to explore phenomena such as invasive species jiménez valverde et al 2011 or climate change impacts pearson and dawson 2003 implementation of new modelling methods represents efforts to improve enm and sdm capabilities for instance ready et al 2010 presented the online approach aquamaps http www aquamaps org designed to estimate suitability for species on the basis of presence only data and a set of environmental variables while incorporating expert knowledge to account for potential bias in data sets the performance of aquamaps models have been found to compare well with other methods such as maxent and glm ready et al 2010 johnston and purkis 2012 developed invasionsoft a web based modelling tool designed to study marine invasions using a cellular automata algorithm to relate historical records of the invasion process of the species of interest with a set of environmental descriptors in a test case using lionfish and seaweed the algorithm was able to emulate the spread of those marine organisms nevertheless we are not aware of other articles using this software 4 8 4 conservation planning conservation management can benefit from models that provide information about present day distributions galparsoro et al 2009 range shifts expected under climate change chust et al 2014 potential spread of invasive species de rivera et al 2011 and habitat use ballard et al 2012 la manna et al 2016 of the 328 articles reviewed 36 included some aspect of conservation planning most commonly for fish molluscs mammals and seabirds the most common goal was to designate marine protected areas mpas for example ballard et al 2012 combined enms of whales seals and seabirds along with information on their feeding habits to identify sites in the ross sea most important for conservation similar studies have been conducted for marine mammals in scotland embling et al 2010 fish in new zealand leathwick et al 2008 and kelps in france bajjouk et al 2015 models have also been used to identify sites of vulnerability to pollution in seabirds lieske et al 2014 vulnerability to fishing mortality for commercial species abecasis et al 2014 and potential risk of bycatch for marine mammals briscoe et al 2014 4 8 5 range shifts animal populations tend to move or shift their geographic ranges in response to specific conditions across marine habitats these conditions may vary through the life history of a single organism such as in seeking predator free sites or optimal sites for feeding or spawning afonso et al 2014 fromentin and lopuszanski 2014 species distributions in space and time reflect spatial patterns in population dynamics an important issue in conservation and particularly for migratory species that have complex spatial dynamics since they may change habitat preferences between migratory endpoints or during different life history stages mckinney et al 2012 of the 328 articles reviewed 31 were related to these issues particularly in seabirds and mammals for instance some authors have tried to predict foraging sites dynamics for seabirds including the albatrosses diomedea exulans louzao et al 2013 and thalassarche chrysostoma scales et al 2016 and the gannet morus bassanus skov et al 2008 models have also been used to identify optimal chick rearing habitats for pygoscelis penguin species cimino et al 2013 for mammals models have been applied to identify habitat partitioning in humpback whales between different reproductive states and behaviors lindsay et al 2016 other cases include modelling species distributions among seasons reilly 1990 pitchford et al 2016 for fish models have been used to identify optimal sites for feeding spawning and nursery areas florin et al 2009 druon et al 2015 2016 gonzález irusta and wright 2016 4 8 6 invasive species invasive species represent one of the main causes of biodiversity loss bellard et al 2016 they can displace native species change the community structure and function and cause significant economic losses by affecting ecosystem services molnar et al 2008 pejchar and mooney 2009 consequently understanding and predicting the potential for spread of invasive exotic species is crucial to effective management applications of models to invasive species have sought to evaluate their potential to spread also see section on methodological advances above of the 328 articles reviewed 32 were related to invasive species particularly on seaweed table 1 for example researchers have used models to investigate the potential for spread and the environmental factors that favor or limit the establishment of species such as the invasive kelp undaria pinnatifida at local báez et al 2010 and global james et al 2015 scales the mussel mytilus galloprovincialis in southern africa assis et al 2015 the scleractinian corals tubastraea coccinea and t tagusensis in atlantic waters carlos júnior et al 2015a b and the seastar asterias amurensis in the southern ocean byrne et al 2016 in another example niche models were built to test niche conservatism of fish in the mediterranean sea parravicini et al 2015 this topic has rarely been explored in marine organisms 4 8 7 properties of populations and communities herein properties refers to abundance biomass density and richness of the 328 articles reviewed 31 focused on these subjects with fish and mammals as the most frequent taxa table 1 the most common topic was prediction of species abundance within the 1990 2016 literature search the earliest work we found that used statistical procedures to relate abundance to environmental variables fiedler and reilly 1994 combined cetacean sighting data with in situ data of temperature and thermocline depth and thickness via canonical correspondence analysis to calculate a habitat quality index for fish niche models have been used to predict relative abundance of the mesopelagic fish electrona antarctica in the southern ocean loots et al 2007 and the swordfish xiphias gladius in the indian ocean lan et al 2014 and to predict potential changes in abundance for x gladius and the sardine s bentincki in the pacific under climate change silva et al 2015 other groups of interest in predicting abundances have been rays dedman et al 2015 and molluscs with commercial importance such as abalone russell et al 2012 fordham et al 2013a density and biomass have been estimated for fish populations in the pacific su et al 2011 and atlantic oceans lynch et al 2015 considering climate change predictions and for mammals in the pacific ocean becker et al 2012 2016 knudby et al 2011 used enms to predict species richness diversity and biomass of fish in the fiji archipelago other studies have modelled biomass of kelp species in france gorman et al 2013 bajjouk et al 2015 detected biomass hot spots of bivalves in the baltic sea darr et al 2014 and modelled bivalve densities in the mediterranean sea vázquez luis et al 2014 models have estimated species richness for fish in the caribbean pittman et al 2007 and potential changes in mammalian species richness worldwide under climate change scenarios kaschner et al 2011 4 8 8 modelling past distributions the earth s climate has experienced continuous changes over the past 65 million years and beyond shifting from extreme warmth to extreme cold zachos et al 2001 past and current evidence suggests that changing climates profoundly influence expansion or contraction in species ranges pearson and dawson 2003 knowledge of species responses to past climatic changes helps to anticipate responses to future climate changes araújo and pearson 2005 kettle et al 2011 models have been used to explore the biogeographic history of several marine species 18 of the articles reviewed were related to past climates focusing on seaweed molluscs crustaceans fish and mammals table 1 for example saupe et al 2015 used enm to evaluate the vulnerability to extinction of 92 bivalve and gastropod species that lived during the mid pliocene warm period by relating niche breadth geographic range size and area availability for seaweed models have been used to explore influences of past climates on the distribution and genetic composition of saccorhiza polyschides assis et al 2016a laminaria hyperborea assis et al 2016b and fucus vasiculosus assis et al 2014 populations for marine fish last glacial maximum distributional patterns have been modelled bigg et al 2008 kettle et al 2011 4 8 9 other applications finally 14 of the articles reviewed used models to study other aspects of marine taxa such as the relationship between phylogenetic structure and distributional patterns of gastropod species carranza et al 2011 to test for niche shifts in invasive coral species carlos júnior et al 2015a to understand evolutionary niche dynamics of seaweed verbruggen et al 2009 to test long term niche stability of benthic species brame and stigall 2014 to study niche divergence among closely related seabirds in combination with stable isotope analysis rayner et al 2016 and to compare realized ecological niches of phytoplankton species categorizations of populations strategies and functional groups brun et al 2015 4 9 spatial patterns by application we observed an emphasis in western europe on the study of distributions in current future and past climate scenarios studies of invasive species were mostly in the mediterranean sea which has had numerous biological invasions mainly thanks to the suez canal and also from aquaculture and the aquarium trade katsanevakis et al 2014 2016 galil et al 2015 a secondary focus of invasive species was on the brazilian coast conservation planning was of particular concern in the united kingdom most studies concerning conservation or management were across small areas appropriate in the context of conservation efforts for which legal responsibility relies in local agencies boersma and parrish 1999 studies related to habitat use were more uniformly distributed across all oceans fig 9 5 concluding remarks our examination of the published literature revealed an enormous interest in application of enms and sdms to explaining and predicting distributional patterns and the processes shaping them for marine species the most common research questions are headed towards the understanding of the processes shaping species distributions and the impact of climate change on species habitat suitability and distribution taxonomic groups more studied are fish molluscs and mammals obeying the economic and ecological relevance of the first two and conservation importance of the last taxonomic groups least represented are sponges foraminifera reptiles tunicates and bacteria we also found little representation of important habitat forming species such as shallow and deep scleractinian corals kelp forests and seagrasses even though recently have been published more studies about these groups we think is of primer importance to keep addressing them in the research agenda in the face of growing threats to marine ecosystems a wide range of modelling techniques is available the correlative approach is by far the most common but mechanistic or process oriented modelling approaches can be more appropriate in some cases although are generally more difficult to implement given the amount and quality of data they require for proper calibration e g physiological and demographic parameters dispersal capacity mechanistic models have the advantage that by incorporating physiological information have a stronger predictive power and thus are more suitable in cases such as range shifts climate change impacts or species invasions process oriented models that include distribution potential and populations dynamics are adequate to predict species distributions in spatially and temporally explicit frameworks not only accounting for habitat suitability as such we suggest strongly that choice of modelling technique follow the needs of the specific question and data availability common problems and pitfalls rely on the lack of clarity in the concepts and on a proper use of ecological niche theory behind model design many articles do not differentiate clearly between ecological niche models and species distribution models proper use of these concepts is greatly encouraged although these issues are not exclusive to modelling in marine environments many articles failed to clarify the niche concepts used e g fundamental existing or realized niche or the criteria used to define their modelling framework i e the basis upon which the modelling technique was chosen many articles did not make clear that they had considered limitations of the data occurrence or environmental e g spatial autocorrelation among occurrence points we call for a rigorous process of model selection and validation in order to generate models as reliable as possible specially when research questions go beyond theoretical interest that is to say with explicit interest in the application of models to conservation and management issues unique aspects of marine modelling that impose and extra challenge are related to the dynamic nature of marine ecosystems we highlight the need to understand and incorporate these complex dynamics especially in the case of highly mobile pelagic organisms by paying special attention to the temporal and spatial scales being handled in the models the additions of a third dimension in representing the marine realm from a volumetric perspective has yet to be incorporated more broadly these unique aspects of marine habitats urge to multidisciplinary work that help us to understand how the processes inherent to the ocean influence species distributions improved understanding of how niche theory and modelling approaches apply to marine environments will lead to the development of more realistic niche models especially in the case of conservation planning climate change and impacts of invasive species where they represent useful tools in decision making also it is of utmost importance to develop models that can be truly incorporated in real life solutions to conservation and management needs as well as to bet for the combinations of this models with other fields such as evolution trait based approaches or even social and legislative matters which can guide us to a better understanding of ecosystems processes and species responses to extant and novel environmental conditions oceans cover more than 70 of earth s surface and around the 95 of it remains unexplored many marine resources are considered as goods for human beings and we obtain from them an important number of services there is a strong bond between oceans and humanity and an urgent need to understand de complex dynamic and processes occurring in order to protect conserve or recover our ocean ecosystems enms and sdms represent a valuable tool for this research but only when more clarity infuses study design and conception including correct use of concepts niche theory aims and methodology will niche modelling be fully able to enhance in the marine realms author contributions smmm and hrb conceived the idea smmm performed literature search and analysis of information aln contributed to the formal analysis visualization and interpretation of

24947,in recent years the use of ecological niche models enms and species distribution models sdms to explore the patterns and processes behind observed distribution of species has experienced an explosive growth although the use of these methods has been less common and more recent in marine ecosystems than in a terrestrial context they have shown significant increases in use and applications herein we provide a systematic review of 328 articles on marine enms and sdms published between 1990 and 2016 aiming to identify their main applications and the diversity of methodological frameworks in which they are developed including spatial scale geographic realm taxonomic groups assessed algorithms implemented and data sources of the 328 studies 48 were at local scales with a hotspot of research effort in the north atlantic ocean most studies were based on correlative approaches and were used to answer ecological or biogeographic questions about mechanisms underlying geographic ranges 64 a few attempted to evaluate impacts of climate change 19 or to develop strategies for conservation 11 several correlative techniques have been used but most common was the machine learning approach maxent 46 and statistical approaches such as generalized additive models gams 22 and generalized linear models glms 14 the groups most studied were fish 23 molluscs 16 and marine mammals 14 the first two with commercial importance and the last important for conservation we noted a lack of clarity regarding the definitions of enms versus sdms and a rather consistent failure to differentiate between them this review exposed a need to know reduce and report error and uncertainty associated with species occurrence records and environmental data in addition particular to marine realms a third dimension should be incorporated into the modelling process referring to the vertical position of the species which will improve the precision and utility of these models so too is of paramount importance the consideration of temporal and spatial resolution of environmental layers to adequately represent the dynamic nature of marine ecosystems especially in the case of highly mobile species keywords biogeography coastal correlative modelling geographic distribution ocean process based modelling sea suitability 1 introduction ecological niche models enms and species distribution models sdms are commonly used in theoretical and applied studies in ecology and biogeography peterson et al 2015 among the most common applications are determining suitable sites for species guisan and zimmermann 2000 predicting impacts of future climate change on species distributions pearson and dawson 2003 evaluating the invasive potential of non native species jiménez valverde et al 2011 and conservation planning guisan et al 2013 three main categories of models are recognized in this field correlative models the most common in the literature which estimate the ecological requirements of species by relating their known geographic distributions to a set of environmental variables araújo and guisan 2006 franklin 2009 mechanistic models that use detailed physiological information and first principles of biophysics kearney and porter 2009 and process oriented models which estimate distributions of species in terms of processes including dispersal capability and biotic interactions peterson et al 2015 throughout the history of modelling species niches and distributions such models have received a variety of names bioclimatic envelope models araújo and peterson 2012 habitat suitability models hirzel et al 2006 species distribution models elith and leathwick 2009 and ecological niche models peterson 2006 this panoply of terms has led to confusion and sometimes misinterpretation of model results peterson and soberón 2012 soberón et al 2017 more recently two terms for two kinds of models has gained attention acceptance is growing for the terms enm and sdm as two distinct approaches to answering different questions peterson and soberón 2012 enms estimate fundamental niches of species and are applied when the aim is to know the potential distribution as in the case of invasive species or projections in space and time on the other hand sdms attempt to estimate objects in geographic space referring to actual distributions of species peterson and soberón 2012 soberón et al 2017 implementation of enms and sdms started with terrestrial species with increasing numbers of publications each year robinson et al 2011 their application to marine species has been less frequent however niche models applied to marine systems have become more popular in recent years fig 1 robinson et al 2017 modelling marine species may be a challenge owing to the particular physical and biological characteristics of marine habitats and species robinson et al 2011 one of the main challenges is the three dimensionality of marine habitats especially when modelling pelagic species living in the middle layers of the water column dambach and rödder 2011 bentlage et al 2013 this challenge is mainly imposed by the fact that most available environmental data layers describe the uppermost layers or the ocean floor assis et al 2017a and because of the limited knowledge of many pelagic organisms ecology and behavior bentlage et al 2013 another important challenge is the dynamic nature of marine ecosystems and the multiple spatial and temporal scales in which species environment relationships occurs redfern et al 2006 scales et al 2017 this dynamism is essential in the case of highly mobile species for which transitory environmental conditions may determine distribution over short time frames fernandez et al 2017 2018 another particularity is the lack of hard physical barriers to dispersal for most marine organisms dispersal depends upon ocean currents so the inclusion of ocean currents in the models or taking species dispersal into account should enhance the development of more reliable models dambach and rödder 2011 previous efforts to summarize the state on the field of enm and sdm in the marine realm include the works of dambach and rödder 2011 and robinson et al 2011 who provided overviews of marine niche modelling applications and highlighted the particular challenges in modelling marine environments such as three dimensionality species interactions and ontogenetic shifts vierod et al 2014 reviewed applications of niche models in deep sea ecosystems that are considered vulnerable pointing out data limitations and implications of model predictions and paying special attention to sampling bias spatial autocorrelation spatial scale and model evaluation and validation issues of paramount importance that are still under discussion in the field of modelling marshall et al 2014 analyzed the use of these models in planning marine conservation they highlighted the fact that in most cases models related to marine ecosystems are not linked to management decisions and about the need to use these models into spatial prioritization programs moreover they recommend the use of models in combination with layers of human footprint to add value to the models for conservation purposes marcelino and verbruggen 2015 reviewed the use of these techniques to model invasive seaweeds and pointed out some particularities when modelling invasive species such as the assumption that those species are in equilibrium with its environment and about the fact that they retain their ecological niche most recently robinson et al 2017 reviewed applications of marine models and developed a framework to guide future applications through the use of a flow diagram to guide the process towards model implementation calibration and validation this review aims to answer key questions related to use of enms and sdms in marine ecosystems on the basis of 328 research articles published on the topic between 1990 and 2016 for most cases both enms and sdms are herein referred to as models except when we want to emphasize differences between them this is the most comprehensive review yet compiled for marine environments as it includes information from previous reviews plus new additions that have not been summarized previously here we summarize applications of the models and the taxa that have been targets of modelling studies we identify gaps in modelling of marine species and point out emerging trends in the field we consider aspects of modelling that are specific to marine environments 2 ecological niche concepts in enms and sdms species distribution modelling and ecological niche modelling rely on ecological niche theory the ecological niche of a species was originally defined as the suite of ecological conditions within which a species is capable of surviving and reproducing without immigrational subsidy grinnell 1917 later the term was recycled to refer to the functional role that a species plays in a community elton 1927 still later distinction was drawn between the fundamental niche the set of abiotic environmental conditions under which a species is able to persist indefinitely and the realized niche the part of the fundamental niche that is constrained by interactions with other species hutchinson 1957 as such species ranges can be conceived of as a consequence of three factors soberón and peterson 2005 i presence of environmental abiotic conditions under which the species can establish survive and reproduce ii the biotic environment determined by the presence of species interactions such as competition or predation in which species can persist and iii the area that is accessible to the species via its movement or dispersal capabilities these restrictions have been captured in the so called bam diagram fig 2 a b biotic a abiotic m movement soberón and peterson 2005 which has become a central concern in designing models barve et al 2011 saupe et al 2012 species geographic ranges are the result of the dynamic interactions of those three factors in niche modelling inclusion of b presents a problem owing to the complexity of biotic interactions and estimation of m is a complex challenge since it involves knowledge of areas that have been accessible to the species over relevant time periods barve et al 2011 hence most correlative models have been restricted to representations of a peterson et al 2011 presented the eltonian noise hypothesis which is the idea that biotic interactions seldom constitute a significant constraint on the distributional potential of species on large geographic extents and low resolutions this is also a hypothesis about biological processes and represents a simplification of modelling methodologies considering the difficulties to include biotic interactions in the process biotic interactions are hard to measure and represent in a raster grid format soberón and nakamura 2009 for some species ecological interactions may not play a dominant role at the coarse resolution typically used for modelling and niche models have demonstrated a good performance in describing their distribution on the basis of a costa et al 2010 lira noriega et al 2013 conversely for some species it has been demonstrated that accounting for biotic interactions improves model capability at predicting their distributions de araújo et al 2014 another important concept in niche theory applied to niche and distribution models is the so called hutchinson s duality which refers to the correspondence between niche i e environmental or ecological and geographic i e distributional spaces fig 2 b and d according to this hypothesis a region of the niche space may correspond to more than one place in the geographic space whereas each point in the geographic space corresponds to exactly one point in niche space colwell and rangel 2009 this hypothesis is of great utility for explaining the differences between enms and sdms concepts which mistakenly are often termed as equivalent peterson and soberón 2012 for practical considerations sdm refers to the modelling objects in g space whereas enm refers to modelling objects in e space soberón et al 2017 enm requires an explicit estimation of the species fundamental niche and are intended to model the processes that shape the area of distribution of the species and frequently used to transfer those causal factors into projections in space or time peterson and soberón 2012 sdm can only focus on the species distribution and ideally must restrict model calibration to accessible areas m account for true absences and incorporate dispersal and colonization capabilities peterson and soberón 2012 it is clear that there is an intimate relationship between these two concepts and delimiting one or the other may be confusing but in order to let the field grow it is important to be consistent and rigorous with the use of the terminology 3 literature search and analysis 3 1 literature search using the isi web of science and scopus databases we performed an exhaustive literature search using the keywords species distribution models habitat suitability models ecological niche models and bioclimatic envelope models each accompanied successively by the words sea marine and ocean the initial search restricted to articles published during 1990 2016 yielded more than 2000 articles we discarded articles that did not make explicit reference to modelling species distributions or ecological niches in a grinnellian sense soberón 2007 and those focused on biotic interactions e g studies of trophic niches articles regarding mangrove ecosystems were also discarded though we included studies of marine species able to live in estuaries and rivers additionally we searched the references sections of each article for relevant publications that might not have been detected in the initial search in total 328 articles were selected to be included in this review appendix a 3 2 summary of information each article was entered in a database with author s publication year study region and the following fields 3 2 1 extent of analysis in order to know the analytical extent of the studies these were classified as locals if they cover the territory of one country or less e g portuguese coast as regionals for two or more countries e g mediterranean sea and global if they were accomplished worldwide 3 2 2 taxonomic group the classification of target species by taxonomic group did not focus on a particular taxonomic category to illustrate the great variety of organisms studied thus categories include phylum subphylum and class and less formal groups such as seaweed for the purpose of this review elasmobranch is taken as a group separated from the category fish which includes the actinopterygii class 3 2 3 source of occurrence data and environmental variables we registered sources of occurrences data and environmental variables in modelling studies we also recorded the environmental variables used in each study e g wind velocity water temperature 3 2 4 type of model and modelling technique we classified the studies as correlative mechanistic or process oriented since most studies were correlative we further classified all articles depending on the modelling technique that they used e g maxent glm enfa 3 2 5 model selection and validation in order to know how model selection and validation is done we registered the procedures e g cross validation and metrics e g auc tss used in each article 3 2 6 aim of the studies studies were classified according to 9 topic categories present potential distribution climate change impacts invasive species distributions under past climates abundance models populations and communities habitat use evaluation of methods conservation planning and management and other the latter category includes testing niche conservatism evolution or niche reconstruction and review articles articles addressing more than one research question were assigned to several categories if necessary finally in order to enlighten the geographic distribution of enm and sdm efforts the study area described in each article was digitized with gis software using as a reference a 1 spatial resolution global grid we extended this spatial representation to the modelling purposes and the taxonomic groups studied in the articles 4 enms and sdms in the marine realm to our knowledge this review of 328 articles is the most extensive overview of applications of sdm and enm in the marine realm we found a great variety of applications species being modelled environments being studied and a broad geographic distribution of studies below we attempt to describe the main findings of the literature reviewed 4 1 regions studied and extent of analysis each ocean was covered by at least 39 modelling exercises research in marine systems most frequently concerned the north atlantic ocean hotspots of studies were along the northeastern coast of the united states the west coast of europe and the mediterranean sea fig 3 the least studied areas were the northwestern pacific ocean and the indian ocean models have been used in all marine ecoregions see also robinson et al 2017 with clear interest in the north atlantic ocean local studies predominated followed by regional studies only a few studies were at global scales fig 4 4 2 taxonomic groups in marine modelling diverse marine taxonomic groups have been studied using enms or sdms studies of fish and molluscs were most common 77 and 52 articles respectively fig 4 this concentration could be explained by the commercial importance that fisheries of those groups represent worldwide according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao in 2015 fish and molluscs occupied first and second places respectively in global capture production in marine fishing areas fao 2017 most of the articles concerning these groups targeted commercial species such as anchovy and jack fish and abalone and clams a third group of importance in modelling were mammals n 48 which are among the most threatened species facing severe population declines reeves et al 2013 mainly owing to bycatch fisheries and pollution schipper et al 2008 as well as ship strikes and noise disturbance aguilar de soto et al 2016 pirotta et al 2019 which now are recognized as major threats to marine mammals hence they are attractive for this kind of study another reason that makes these three groups suitable for modelling is the amount of data available via the obis portal http www iobis org 20 million records are available for pisces 3 million for mollusca and 1 million for mammalia other taxonomic groups well represented among the articles reviewed here were seaweed n 34 crustaceans n 29 seabirds n 28 and stony corals n 25 for seaweed target species were mainly invasive and crustacean included several economically important groups such as lobsters seabirds had a special interest for conservation as well as stony corals since their ecological importance like habitat forming species seagrasses are among the least studied groups n 10 even though they provide key ecological services and there is a growing need for protection and conservation in the face of global threats orth et al 2006 two studies predicted the potential distribution and habitat suitability for the seagrasses zostera noltii and z marina valle et al 2011 downie et al 2013 yet we found just one article evaluating the impact of rising seawater temperatures and sea level rise on the distribution of z noltii valle et al 2014 other important habitat forming species that have received little attention are kelp forests and algae but apparently they are receiving more attention since we found recent publications regarding kelp forests assis et al 2018 2017a algae forest from the genus cystoseira buonomo et al 2018 and for the seagrass cymodocea nodosa and posidonia oceanica chefaoui et al 2018 chefaoui and serrão 2017 other poorly represented groups were sponges foraminifera reptiles n 9 each tunicates n 7 and bacteria n 2 something worth mentioning is that we did not find articles regarding the study of viruses during years for which we conducted our review however a more recent article applies enm to study the ecology and epidemiology of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus of fish escobar et al 2018 the study of marine diseases was less represented in the analyzed articles nevertheless we think that distribution and niche models can help to better understand the complicated dynamic of epidemiological and diseases processes in the marine realm in the category reptiles only turtles were found in the literature reviewed which reflects the paucity of marine reptiles in comparison with fishes but reptiles are probably receiving more attention since the recent publication of an article on niche modelling of sea kraits gherghel et al 2018 other cnidarians includes jellyfishes anemones black and red corals the class hydrozoa and the extinct coral grewingkia all of these groups were much less represented in the literature other invertebrates includes the phyla bryozoa placozoa entoprocta nematoda platyhelminthes and xenacoelomorpha the class priapulida and the extinct class trilobita many articles n 50 included multiple taxonomic groups 4 3 spatial patterns by taxonomic group we found a strong interest in fish molluscs crustaceans annelids seaweed and sea grasses in western europe and mediterranean sea fig 5 fig b1 in appendix b elasmobranch studies were more common in the gulf of mexico and near the united kingdom plankton studies were concentrated in the north atlantic ocean mammals in the eastern pacific ocean and echinoderms in the southwestern pacific ocean studies of seabirds were spread more globally but with a marked interest in the southern ocean 4 4 occurrence data for modelling one of the most important inputs for model construction is occurrence data which provide information about environmental conditions where the species is present and thereby allow estimation of niches via correlative methods the occurrence data used in the reviewed literature fig 6 most commonly came from regional databases n 121 and field censuses n 119 other sources included published literature n 91 global databases n 61 and scientific collections n 20 it was relatively common for studies to combine different sources especially for poorly known species global initiatives that provide open access to occurrence data include the global biodiversity information facility gbif https www gbif org ocean biogeographic information system obis http www iobis org fishbase https www fishbase de fishnet2 http www fishnet2 net and d4science infrastructure https www d4science org home other data sources are more specialized in particular taxa such as the microbis database from the international census of marine microbes icomm https vamps mbl edu portals icomm icomm php microbis and the global diatom database leblanc et al 2012 example of regional efforts to compile accessible information on occurrences is the continuous plankton recorder survey cpr https www cprsurvey org in association with the marine biological association of the uk which holds historical data about biogeography and ecology of plankton from the north atlantic and the north sea helaouët and beaugrand 2009 chust et al 2014 barton et al 2016 brun et al 2016 another example is the north atlantic right whale consortium https www narwc org that records historical sightings of right whales and other mammals sea turtles and large fish from the north atlantic ocean gowan and ortega ortiz 2014 alternative regional sources of occurrence data include commercial or recreational fisheries logbooks brodie et al 2015 gomez et al 2015 and programs for assessment of fishing activity and stock conditions maxwell et al 2009 tanaka and chen 2016 among the latter the international bottom trawl survey in the mediterranean medits http jadran izor hr eng international medits html is a program that conducts continuous trawl surveys to assess the status of fishing resources to support the policies and regulation of fisheries in the mediterranean such data besides providing information about occurrences may also inform about their relative abundance and thereby enable models aimed at studying effects of climate change on fish stocks for instance researchers have applied generalized linear and additive models to integrate swordfish xiphias gladius and common sardine strangomera bentincki fisheries data with simulations of future sea surface temperatures to predict changes in their relative abundance and distribution off the coast of chile silva et al 2015 censuses were the second most common source occurrence data since most studies were at local scales researchers can generate their own data we found a variety of survey methods including visual surveys pittman et al 2007 assis et al 2015 and underwater video systems especially for demersal species moore et al 2009 2016 monk et al 2010 mclean et al 2016 another common source was satellite tracking data commonly used for sea turtles pikesley et al 2015 varo cruz et al 2016 whittock et al 2016 seabirds skov et al 2008 catry et al 2013 ramos et al 2015 and mammals edrén et al 2010 information from natural history museums and scientific collections is another valuable source of primary data examples include the south australian museum http www samuseum sa gov au collections bentlage et al 2009 museo nacional de historia natural at montevideo uruguay http www mnhn gub uy innovaportal v 3090 12 mecweb colecciones leftmenuid 3090 carranza et al 2011 and the u s national museum of natural history https naturalhistory si edu rc georgian et al 2014 occurrence databases frequently include important geographic biases such as inaccurate geolocation and spatial autocorrelation among occurrence points as well as species misidentifications as with terrestrial ecosystems it is common that certain marine areas are more visited than others because of their proximity or low cost accessibility which results in oversampling biases that turn into biases in the ecological niche space araújo and guisan 2006 also see fig 2 all modelling algorithms assume that occurrence data are unbiased araújo and guisan 2006 yet in reality they are sensitive to many characteristics of the occurrence data araújo and guisan 2006 loiselle et al 2008 fourcade et al 2014 these biases can lead to model overfitting to environmental conditions associated with particular geographic spaces producing poorly reliable models araújo and guisan 2006 boria et al 2014 and also impact model evaluation since in most cases there is no independent data to perform the test a common practice is to randomly split occurrence data into training and testing subsets despite both subsets keep sharing the same bias and may show an inflated metric for validation veloz 2009 these remarks regarding biases and other problems associated to species occurrences are particularly important for pelagic and deep water species that are hard to sample and consequently data poor users and designers of occurrences databases must be aware of errors associated with this type of data acknowledging potential impacts on model performance while also submitting occurrence data to exhaustive procedure of data cleaning peterson et al 2011 and ideally by making specific mentions about data quality in metadata files at the time of making the data available 4 5 environmental data for modelling recent technological developments have enabled access to increasing amounts of environmental information derived from remotely sensed data at high spatial resolutions through data interpolation or from modelled data as with many climate data products we found four main sources of environmental information global data bases providing environmental parameters for whole oceans information generated by the authors through either field measurements or computational methods regional databases and in some cases published information fig 7 global databases were by far the most common n 239 among data portals most frequently used were the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa other data were accessed through the ocean color web https oceancolor gsfc nasa gov physical oceanography distributed active archive center podaac https podaac jpl nasa gov national centers for environmental information https www ngdc noaa gov world ocean atlas woa https www nodc

by the european commission and offers products describing the physical and biogeochemical state of the global ocean and european regional seas the most cited source for bathymetric data was the general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco https www gebco net which offers a 15 arc second resolution grid for the global ocean an example of a regional database is the australian bureau of meteorology consulted by adams et al 2015 to obtain data on wind speed and direction and solar exposure with the goal of identifying environmental factors limiting seagrass survival in moreton bay australia sarà et al 2013 used hourly seawater temperature data from the italian oceanographic buoy network at the instituto superiore per la protezione e la ricerca ambientale to generate a mechanistic model of fitness and potential colonization areas for the invasive mussel brachidontes pharaonis in the italian portion of the mediterranean finally carlucci et al 2016 used bathymetric data from the european marine observation and data network emodnet http www emodnet eu what emodnet to assess driving forces influencing the distribution of dolphin species in the gulf of taranto generation of environmental variables by the authors themselves was not common however one example is the use of multibeam echosounder systems to produce bathymetric data howell et al 2011 monk et al 2011 gonzález irusta et al 2015 piechaud et al 2015 selection of key environmental variables in which to explore the niche of species is a crucial step in model design inclusion of too many environmental dimensions can cause model overfitting peterson et al 2007 thus as good practice various biological or statistical criteria are used to select the best set of environmental predictors principal components analysis pca is the most commonly used to reduce dimensionality of environmental spaces dennis and hellberg 2010 freeman et al 2013 escobar et al 2015 another common procedure for variable selection involves the estimation of correlation among candidate variables combined with the results of a jackknife analysis performed in maxent under this method variable selection obeys low collinearity and high contribution values raghavan et al 2019a b in marine environments the water column creates a three dimensional structure that represents an extra challenge in modelling dambach and rödder 2011 robinson et al 2011 the study of pelagic organisms represents a particular challenge given the difficulties of access and sampling in open oceans bentlage et al 2013 most oceanographic data are representative of the topmost layers of the water column and those representative of the seabed are often derived from bathymetric profiles assis et al 2017a which impedes modelling of pelagic and highly mobile species bentlage et al 2013 modelled the potential distribution of the open ocean jellyfish periphylla periphylla on a global scale they used oceanographic variables woa05 at multiple depths and added the third dimension by transforming and combining all depth layers into a single continuous grid two dimensional that replicated global oceans multiple times as such the model encompassed the whole environmental range occupied by the species in three dimensions duffy and chown 2017 used similar approaches to estimate the probability of occurrence of four fish species in the northeastern atlantic highlighting the importance of explicit consideration of the vertical dimension the temporal resolution of environmental layers is important especially in the case of highly mobile species since their distributions may be associated with both short and long term variability in ocean environments fernandez et al 2017 mannocci et al 2017 in the literature reviewed here little attention was paid to this point and the use of variables appeared more related to availability than to detailed analysis of impacts of temporal resolution on distributions of target species an exception is the work of scales et al 2016 who used remotely sensed environmental variables that temporally matched with tracking data for the grey headed albatross thalassarche chrysostoma to identify foraging areas fortunately it seems that this field is gaining attention among the modelling community since contributions addressing this topic although mainly focusing on mammals have been recently published it has been found that finer temporal scales may provide more accurate models especially for species such as blue fin and sei whales that are highly dependent on dynamic variables fernandez et al 2018 other studies regarding the spatio temporal variability and habitat dynamism for modelling the distribution of blue whales in the azores islands and the california coast in usa highlighted the utility of multiscale studies to capture the factors that affect the distribution of this highly migratory species abrahms et al 2019 gonzález garcía et al 2018 these contributions have been important to understand how species make use of or shift among dynamic habitats and to reinforce the importance of such models for conservation strategies influences of data quality on model performance have been investigated for marine systems becker et al 2016 compared the performance of two cetacean density models one built with oceanographic information and the other with data measured in situ they found no significant differences in the metrics evaluated suggesting that modelled data which are considerably easier and less costly to assemble can support modelling efforts adequately to assess effects of spatial resolution on model predictions basher et al 2014 modelled distributions of shrimp species in the ross sea they found that spatial resolution influences both the extent of the resulting suitable area and the relative importance of environmental variables a great diversity of variables was used to describe species niches including physical and chemical properties of the water column topographic characteristics of the seabed factors describing the surrounding environments and variables related to biotic interactions table c1 appendix c the most common descriptor used was water temperature which was used in 240 of the articles reviewed temperature is among the most important determinants of species distributions and as a single environmental covariate can predict 53 99 of present day biogeographic units along coastlines belanger et al 2012 other physical variables included photosynthetically active radiation par n 26 and diffuse attenuation coefficient n 20 chemical variables included salinity n 147 and chlorophyll a concentration n 97 atmospheric variables included air temperature n 15 and precipitation n 9 environmental descriptors included sediment type n 30 and substrate bottom type n 27 geographic variables included distance to shore n 54 and geographic coordinates n 20 hydrodynamic variables included current

oriented approaches it usually begins with the known distribution of species namely presence presence absence or abundance data which are associated statistically with environmental variables describing dimensions such as climate kearney 2006 peterson et al 2015 its popularity is thanks partly to advances in statistical techniques development of gis tools and availability of specialized modelling software and also to growing availability of detailed data about biodiversity and the environment elith and leathwick 2009 peterson et al 2015 in our review 307 of the articles were exclusively correlative associations so the general tendencies described above represent the main currents in correlative modelling in largest part thus the main focus of this section is on description of methods used in correlative models models differ in the way they select environmental predictors and measure variable contributions and predictive performance elith et al 2006 but they have in common the goal of describing one part of environmental space as suitable and the rest of that space as unsuitable in the earliest marine models reilly 1990 applied analysis of variance to explore relationships between water mass properties density and thermocline depth and seasonal distributions of dolphin groups in the eastern tropical pacific fiedler and reilly 1994 and reilly and fiedler 1994 used canonical correspondence analysis cca to study respectively habitat use and the relationship of dolphin abundance to habitat quality more recently a great variety of methods has been used for modelling species niches and distributions franklin 2009 in our review most popular methods were machine learning methods n 268 followed by statistical methods n 189 and finally similarity based and expert rule approaches n 54 74 studies used a combination of two or more techniques among machine learning methods maxent phillips et al 2006 was most frequent n 147 fig 8 since the appearance of maxent in 2006 it became one of the most popular modelling techniques perhaps partly because it requires relatively little information being designed to work with presence only data phillips et al 2006 maxent has shown robust predictive accuracy elith et al 2006 graham et al 2008 even with small sample sizes hernandez et al 2006 wisz et al 2008 and provides great flexibility in model construction through a friendly interface e g features and regularization multiplier that allow the user to adjust the model to specific needs and available information merow et al 2013 muscarella et al 2014 other well represented machine learning methods have been boosted regression trees brt n 38 and random forests rf n 26 in the case of statistical methods most frequent were regression models i e gams n 70 and glms n 47 fig 8 among similarity based and expert rule models most frequent was the ecological niche factor analysis enfa n 27 fig 8 in spite of their applicability and overall quality or popularity in the field of correlative modelling it is has been recognized that there is no single best algorithm and it is recommended as a good practice to test and justify a suit of algorithms in order to choose the best option for a particular research question qiao et al 2015 4 6 2 mechanistic models mechanistic models use detailed physiological information and first principles of mathematical reasoning to determine links between the environment and the fitness of the organism which is later represented in geographic space kearney 2006 kearney and porter 2009 peterson et al 2015 in our review only 13 articles used mechanistic approaches dynamic energy budget deb models used chlorophyll a to express food availability and water temperature to express body temperature to study relative fitness of native and invasive molluscs this approach generated spatial predictions of their physiological performance and highlighted potential areas for colonization sarà et al 2013 montalto et al 2015 mechanistic niche models have been used to integrate solar radiation salinity and temperature in models designed to evaluate the invasive potential of the ascidian ciona intestinalis and the seaweed codium fragile madariaga et al 2014 other studies have assessed future changes in distributions of planktonic organisms in response to rising temperatures helaouët and beaugrand 2009 thomas et al 2012 other mechanistic niche models explicitly incorporate correlative approaches for instance fordham et al 2013a 2013b modelled the future ranges and abundance of two harvested abalone species haliotis rubra and h laevigata combining demographic processes and physiological responses with climatic factors other studies have used thermal thresholds of macroalgae to predict potential range shifts in response to global warming martínez et al 2014 or have simulated effects of temperature and oxygen concentrations on growth and body weight in fish and invertebrates to predict patterns of change in species richness invasion and extinction worldwide jones and cheung 2014 for two ecologically and economically important mussels mytilus edulis and m galloprovincialis energetic responses to temperature were analysed to understand current and future potential distributions fly et al 2015 4 6 3 process oriented models dynamic models can take into account key processes that affect ranges of species through effects on demographic processes such as birth and death rates and dispersal of individuals case et al 2005 holt and keitt 2005 process oriented models can measure effects of these processes across species distributions peterson et al 2015 in this review only five of the articles included process oriented modelling almost all focused on molluscs and related to their dispersal capabilities process oriented models can be combined with correlative approaches among the articles reviewed the earliest process oriented model inglis et al 2006 examined the utility of habitat suitability index models and particle dispersion models to project suitable habitat for the non native bivalves theora lubrica and musculista senhousia in new zealand for m galloprovincialis which is invasive in southern africa assis et al 2015 combined niche modelling and lagrangian particle simulations to assess its current distribution and evaluate effects of dispersal capacity and environment as controls on its potential to spread in the bay of santander spain bidegain et al 2013 combined niche modelling with a particle tracking model to study larval transport supply settlement behavior and post settlement mortality of the clams ruditapes decussatus and r philippinarum to identify optimal habitat for settlement and assess connectivity between spawning and nursery grounds finally elsäßer et al 2013 combined niche and particle dispersal models to identify suitable areas for adult translocation that could represent restoration sites for biogenic reefs formed by the horse mussel modiolus modiolus in northern ireland in our only example including fish cheung et al 2009 analysed likely effects of climate change on distributions of 1066 commercially exploited marine fish and invertebrates using a dynamic model including environmental variables and simulations of abundances derived from a logistic population growth model 4 7 model selection and validation model selection and validation is a critical step in the model procedure it is the measure of how useful and trustworthy our models are most importantly when the intention is transferring the model to novel conditions wenger and olden 2012 considering only correlative models 224 articles used a cross validation method mostly by randomly dividing occurrence data whereas only 21 used independent test data the most frequent evaluation measure was the threshold independent area under the receiver operating characteristic roc curve auc n 177 followed by the akaike s information criterion aic or aicc n 42 the true skill statistics tss n 35 and the kappa statistic n 26 111 articles combined more than one validation metrics model selection is a debated topic in enm and sdm currently warren and seifert 2011 and newer applications that run maxent and other algorithms have adopted statistical model evaluations and metrics based on information criteria as the standard to choose among all possible combinations of model parameterizations muscarella et al 2014 cobos et al 2019 such approximations to model selection and evaluation represent a more robust protocol while implementing enm and have demonstrated to yield better results than only using default parameters 4 8 enms and sdms applications 4 8 1 current species distribution patterns models are often used to investigate factors that limit species distributions and to fill gaps in information about species ranges in our review 212 of the articles aimed to explore potential distributions of species or to elucidate which environmental factors are responsible for observed patterns most distributional studies concerned fish mammals molluscs or seaweed table 1 for instance enm and sdm have been used to investigate the potential distribution of the harmful cyanobacteria lyngbya majuscula in the canary islands martín garcía et al 2014 and to measure the effect of environmental variables on shaping the distribution of fish species beger and possingham 2008 chatfield et al 2010 for the kelp laminaria hyperborea assis et al 2016b and for commercial cephalopods lauria et al 2015 for several articles a study of the distribution patterns was the first step toward answering more complex questions including topics such as climate change impacts and conservation planning 4 8 2 impacts of future climate change the average global surface temperature of the earth has increased by approximately 0 2 c per decade over the past 30 years hansen et al 2006 more than 90 of the excess heat is absorbed by the ocean driving to a rate of warming of about 0 11 c per decade in the upper layer and an increase in the global mean sea level of 0 19 m and a decrease of seawater ph by 0 1 units in recent decades rhein et al 2013 of the articles reviewed 64 aimed to analyse some aspect of future climate change the most frequent taxa in these studies were fish and molluscs table 1 model scenarios have been used to improve understanding of how climate change may impact marine ecosystems and species most have focused on predicting potential changes of species distributions in response to climate change for example assis et al 2016b used niche modelling to predict consequences of future climate change on the distribution and genetic diversity of the kelp l hyperborea in europe they suggested that changes in environmental conditions may lead to loss of suitability in areas where the species has persisted through time and a possible northward range shift a model of shallow coral reefs worldwide couce et al 2013 assessed potential effects of increasing sea surface temperature and ocean acidification on these ecosystems temperature would be the main driver in the decline of suitability particularly in the indo pacific region and in producing a poleward range expansion of suitable areas 4 8 3 methodological advances in the past two decades use of models has grown rapidly lobo et al 2010 with a concomitant increase in interest in improving their performance of the 328 articles reviewed here however only 41 addressed performance of the models the most frequent way to evaluate performance was to compare the results of multiple techniques in a single scenario for instance jones et al 2012 compared the performance of three different approaches aquamaps maxent and sea around us project algorithms in modelling commercial fish distribution in the north sea and north atlantic bucas et al 2013 compared outcomes of four modelling algorithms gams rf mars and maxent in predicting the distribution and diversity of benthic species in the baltic sea another contribution to methodological advance is ensemble modelling approaches that is results from different algorithms can be combined to produce a more robust model including results from more than one set of model parameters thuiller et al 2009 in the marine realm ensemble models have been used to predict potential distributions of flatback turtles natator depressus whittock et al 2016 future suitability for the barau s petrel pterodroma baraui legrand et al 2016 and impacts of climate change on fish diversity in the mediterranean sea albouy et al 2015 other authors have evaluated transfer capability of models for example lauria et al 2015 evaluated model capacity to spatially predict density of the commercially important norway lobster nephrops norvegicus in fishing areas of the northeast atlantic they found that most of the models were able to successfully predict lobster density among fishing areas suggesting that simple regression models perform as well as complex models in space transferability verbruggen et al 2013 studied the model transfer capability for the invasive seaweed caulerpa cylindracea they found that appropriate predictor selection plays an important role in transferability success projection exercises are a difficult task in the field of modelling because we don t have the capacity to validate that a successful model predicting the actual distribution of species is equally successful in predicting its distribution on novel conditions when projected to new areas or in climate change scenarios it has been shown that when transferring models it is difficult to accurately estimate the existing fundamental niche of species specially when it is not well represented in the calibration area qiao et al 2019 it is also of high importance to evaluate the degree of environmental similarity between calibration and projection regions as well as to make a proper selection of the modelling algorithm considering the completeness in the knowledge of the species fundamental niche qiao et al 2019 despite this model projections represent a valuable tool to explore phenomena such as invasive species jiménez valverde et al 2011 or climate change impacts pearson and dawson 2003 implementation of new modelling methods represents efforts to improve enm and sdm capabilities for instance ready et al 2010 presented the online approach aquamaps http www aquamaps org designed to estimate suitability for species on the basis of presence only data and a set of environmental variables while incorporating expert knowledge to account for potential bias in data sets the performance of aquamaps models have been found to compare well with other methods such as maxent and glm ready et al 2010 johnston and purkis 2012 developed invasionsoft a web based modelling tool designed to study marine invasions using a cellular automata algorithm to relate historical records of the invasion process of the species of interest with a set of environmental descriptors in a test case using lionfish and seaweed the algorithm was able to emulate the spread of those marine organisms nevertheless we are not aware of other articles using this software 4 8 4 conservation planning conservation management can benefit from models that provide information about present day distributions galparsoro et al 2009 range shifts expected under climate change chust et al 2014 potential spread of invasive species de rivera et al 2011 and habitat use ballard et al 2012 la manna et al 2016 of the 328 articles reviewed 36 included some aspect of conservation planning most commonly for fish molluscs mammals and seabirds the most common goal was to designate marine protected areas mpas for example ballard et al 2012 combined enms of whales seals and seabirds along with information on their feeding habits to identify sites in the ross sea most important for conservation similar studies have been conducted for marine mammals in scotland embling et al 2010 fish in new zealand leathwick et al 2008 and kelps in france bajjouk et al 2015 models have also been used to identify sites of vulnerability to pollution in seabirds lieske et al 2014 vulnerability to fishing mortality for commercial species abecasis et al 2014 and potential risk of bycatch for marine mammals briscoe et al 2014 4 8 5 range shifts animal populations tend to move or shift their geographic ranges in response to specific conditions across marine habitats these conditions may vary through the life history of a single organism such as in seeking predator free sites or optimal sites for feeding or spawning afonso et al 2014 fromentin and lopuszanski 2014 species distributions in space and time reflect spatial patterns in population dynamics an important issue in conservation and particularly for migratory species that have complex spatial dynamics since they may change habitat preferences between migratory endpoints or during different life history stages mckinney et al 2012 of the 328 articles reviewed 31 were related to these issues particularly in seabirds and mammals for instance some authors have tried to predict foraging sites dynamics for seabirds including the albatrosses diomedea exulans louzao et al 2013 and thalassarche chrysostoma scales et al 2016 and the gannet morus bassanus skov et al 2008 models have also been used to identify optimal chick rearing habitats for pygoscelis penguin species cimino et al 2013 for mammals models have been applied to identify habitat partitioning in humpback whales between different reproductive states and behaviors lindsay et al 2016 other cases include modelling species distributions among seasons reilly 1990 pitchford et al 2016 for fish models have been used to identify optimal sites for feeding spawning and nursery areas florin et al 2009 druon et al 2015 2016 gonzález irusta and wright 2016 4 8 6 invasive species invasive species represent one of the main causes of biodiversity loss bellard et al 2016 they can displace native species change the community structure and function and cause significant economic losses by affecting ecosystem services molnar et al 2008 pejchar and mooney 2009 consequently understanding and predicting the potential for spread of invasive exotic species is crucial to effective management applications of models to invasive species have sought to evaluate their potential to spread also see section on methodological advances above of the 328 articles reviewed 32 were related to invasive species particularly on seaweed table 1 for example researchers have used models to investigate the potential for spread and the environmental factors that favor or limit the establishment of species such as the invasive kelp undaria pinnatifida at local báez et al 2010 and global james et al 2015 scales the mussel mytilus galloprovincialis in southern africa assis et al 2015 the scleractinian corals tubastraea coccinea and t tagusensis in atlantic waters carlos júnior et al 2015a b and the seastar asterias amurensis in the southern ocean byrne et al 2016 in another example niche models were built to test niche conservatism of fish in the mediterranean sea parravicini et al 2015 this topic has rarely been explored in marine organisms 4 8 7 properties of populations and communities herein properties refers to abundance biomass density and richness of the 328 articles reviewed 31 focused on these subjects with fish and mammals as the most frequent taxa table 1 the most common topic was prediction of species abundance within the 1990 2016 literature search the earliest work we found that used statistical procedures to relate abundance to environmental variables fiedler and reilly 1994 combined cetacean sighting data with in situ data of temperature and thermocline depth and thickness via canonical correspondence analysis to calculate a habitat quality index for fish niche models have been used to predict relative abundance of the mesopelagic fish electrona antarctica in the southern ocean loots et al 2007 and the swordfish xiphias gladius in the indian ocean lan et al 2014 and to predict potential changes in abundance for x gladius and the sardine s bentincki in the pacific under climate change silva et al 2015 other groups of interest in predicting abundances have been rays dedman et al 2015 and molluscs with commercial importance such as abalone russell et al 2012 fordham et al 2013a density and biomass have been estimated for fish populations in the pacific su et al 2011 and atlantic oceans lynch et al 2015 considering climate change predictions and for mammals in the pacific ocean becker et al 2012 2016 knudby et al 2011 used enms to predict species richness diversity and biomass of fish in the fiji archipelago other studies have modelled biomass of kelp species in france gorman et al 2013 bajjouk et al 2015 detected biomass hot spots of bivalves in the baltic sea darr et al 2014 and modelled bivalve densities in the mediterranean sea vázquez luis et al 2014 models have estimated species richness for fish in the caribbean pittman et al 2007 and potential changes in mammalian species richness worldwide under climate change scenarios kaschner et al 2011 4 8 8 modelling past distributions the earth s climate has experienced continuous changes over the past 65 million years and beyond shifting from extreme warmth to extreme cold zachos et al 2001 past and current evidence suggests that changing climates profoundly influence expansion or contraction in species ranges pearson and dawson 2003 knowledge of species responses to past climatic changes helps to anticipate responses to future climate changes araújo and pearson 2005 kettle et al 2011 models have been used to explore the biogeographic history of several marine species 18 of the articles reviewed were related to past climates focusing on seaweed molluscs crustaceans fish and mammals table 1 for example saupe et al 2015 used enm to evaluate the vulnerability to extinction of 92 bivalve and gastropod species that lived during the mid pliocene warm period by relating niche breadth geographic range size and area availability for seaweed models have been used to explore influences of past climates on the distribution and genetic composition of saccorhiza polyschides assis et al 2016a laminaria hyperborea assis et al 2016b and fucus vasiculosus assis et al 2014 populations for marine fish last glacial maximum distributional patterns have been modelled bigg et al 2008 kettle et al 2011 4 8 9 other applications finally 14 of the articles reviewed used models to study other aspects of marine taxa such as the relationship between phylogenetic structure and distributional patterns of gastropod species carranza et al 2011 to test for niche shifts in invasive coral species carlos júnior et al 2015a to understand evolutionary niche dynamics of seaweed verbruggen et al 2009 to test long term niche stability of benthic species brame and stigall 2014 to study niche divergence among closely related seabirds in combination with stable isotope analysis rayner et al 2016 and to compare realized ecological niches of phytoplankton species categorizations of populations strategies and functional groups brun et al 2015 4 9 spatial patterns by application we observed an emphasis in western europe on the study of distributions in current future and past climate scenarios studies of invasive species were mostly in the mediterranean sea which has had numerous biological invasions mainly thanks to the suez canal and also from aquaculture and the aquarium trade katsanevakis et al 2014 2016 galil et al 2015 a secondary focus of invasive species was on the brazilian coast conservation planning was of particular concern in the united kingdom most studies concerning conservation or management were across small areas appropriate in the context of conservation efforts for which legal responsibility relies in local agencies boersma and parrish 1999 studies related to habitat use were more uniformly distributed across all oceans fig 9 5 concluding remarks our examination of the published literature revealed an enormous interest in application of enms and sdms to explaining and predicting distributional patterns and the processes shaping them for marine species the most common research questions are headed towards the understanding of the processes shaping species distributions and the impact of climate change on species habitat suitability and distribution taxonomic groups more studied are fish molluscs and mammals obeying the economic and ecological relevance of the first two and conservation importance of the last taxonomic groups least represented are sponges foraminifera reptiles tunicates and bacteria we also found little representation of important habitat forming species such as shallow and deep scleractinian corals kelp forests and seagrasses even though recently have been published more studies about these groups we think is of primer importance to keep addressing them in the research agenda in the face of growing threats to marine ecosystems a wide range of modelling techniques is available the correlative approach is by far the most common but mechanistic or process oriented modelling approaches can be more appropriate in some cases although are generally more difficult to implement given the amount and quality of data they require for proper calibration e g physiological and demographic parameters dispersal capacity mechanistic models have the advantage that by incorporating physiological information have a stronger predictive power and thus are more suitable in cases such as range shifts climate change impacts or species invasions process oriented models that include distribution potential and populations dynamics are adequate to predict species distributions in spatially and temporally explicit frameworks not only accounting for habitat suitability as such we suggest strongly that choice of modelling technique follow the needs of the specific question and data availability common problems and pitfalls rely on the lack of clarity in the concepts and on a proper use of ecological niche theory behind model design many articles do not differentiate clearly between ecological niche models and species distribution models proper use of these concepts is greatly encouraged although these issues are not exclusive to modelling in marine environments many articles failed to clarify the niche concepts used e g fundamental existing or realized niche or the criteria used to define their modelling framework i e the basis upon which the modelling technique was chosen many articles did not make clear that they had considered limitations of the data occurrence or environmental e g spatial autocorrelation among occurrence points we call for a rigorous process of model selection and validation in order to generate models as reliable as possible specially when research questions go beyond theoretical interest that is to say with explicit interest in the application of models to conservation and management issues unique aspects of marine modelling that impose and extra challenge are related to the dynamic nature of marine ecosystems we highlight the need to understand and incorporate these complex dynamics especially in the case of highly mobile pelagic organisms by paying special attention to the temporal and spatial scales being handled in the models the additions of a third dimension in representing the marine realm from a volumetric perspective has yet to be incorporated more broadly these unique aspects of marine habitats urge to multidisciplinary work that help us to understand how the processes inherent to the ocean influence species distributions improved understanding of how niche theory and modelling approaches apply to marine environments will lead to the development of more realistic niche models especially in the case of conservation planning climate change and impacts of invasive species where they represent useful tools in decision making also it is of utmost importance to develop models that can be truly incorporated in real life solutions to conservation and management needs as well as to bet for the combinations of this models with other fields such as evolution trait based approaches or even social and legislative matters which can guide us to a better understanding of ecosystems processes and species responses to extant and novel environmental conditions oceans cover more than 70 of earth s surface and around the 95 of it remains unexplored many marine resources are considered as goods for human beings and we obtain from them an important number of services there is a strong bond between oceans and humanity and an urgent need to understand de complex dynamic and processes occurring in order to protect conserve or recover our ocean ecosystems enms and sdms represent a valuable tool for this research but only when more clarity infuses study design and conception including correct use of concepts niche theory aims and methodology will niche modelling be fully able to enhance in the marine realms author contributions smmm and hrb conceived the idea smmm performed literature search and analysis of information aln contributed to the formal analysis visualization and interpretation of

24948,challenges associated with developing species distribution models sdms with high resolution data including from lidar prompted our investigation into a complementary approach to enhance the performance of sdms using spatial data with different resolutions in our experiment we developed a model with maxent a presence background sdm with variables that had a 30 m resolution and then used the output of the model to restrict the background sampling area for models developed with variables that had a 10 m resolution according to common measures of model quality this approach produced better models than both a model developed with the default maxent background sampling area and a model developed using the conventional approach of resampling environmental data to a common spatial resolution we then reviewed the ecological meaning of this approach and observed how model mechanics were impacted as restricting the background sampling areas led to background points that had a greater contrast with the presence points and therefore different environmental characteristics than background points sampled from the default background sampling area keywords maxent species

maxent is often noted for having predictive power that is competitive with models that utilize absence data despite lacking information on where the species is not present elith et al 2011 maxent begins with a uniform prediction model which states that the species is equally likely to be present through the study area and uses a machine learning technique that contrasts the environmental characteristics at locations where the species is present with the environmental characteristics at background points which are by default sampled from the entire study area as summarized in elith et al 2010 the resulting model minimizes relative entropy between the distributions of independent variables at presence locations and the distributions of independent variables at background points one

the model and sacrificing detail about the independent variables dixon and earls 2009 prompted by the challenges associated with incorporating fine resolution data in sdms our research questions were 1 how can spatial data with different resolutions be utilized in a complementary approach to improve the performance of sdms and 2 how can inferences gained at a coarser scale of analysis be used to improve models developed at local scales one way that researchers have improved the performance of maxent models is by restricting the area used to sample background points needed as inputs to the model to places where environmental characteristics are unsuitable to the species anderson and raza 2010 barve et al 2011 published examples of this method as detailed in jarnevich and young 2015 include restricting background sampling areas with a minimum convex polygon around presence locations jarnevich and young 2015 limiting the background sampling area based on prevailing environmental conditions like köppen geiger zones or ecoregions blanchard et al 2015 tererai and wood 2014 webber et al 2011 eliminating areas that are inaccessible for the focal species from the background sampling area elith et al 2010 and by selecting background points only from areas within a set proximity from presence points vanderwal et al 2009 we hypothesized that by removing areas predicted suitable by models at a different scale from the background sampling area during maxent model development the environmental characteristics of the background points and the presence points would be contrasted to a greater degree which would result in improved model performance employing inferences across scales when developing spatial models is an important focus in spatial ecology which bridges theories of ecological processes with multiscale ecological modeling practice miller et al 2004 researchers may need to aggregate local observations to improve their understanding of broad scale patterns or to extrapolate broad scale knowledge to better model local and individual systems bombi and d amen 2012 fernandes et al 2014 miller et al 2004 one scale based characteristic of environmental variables is the spatial resolution which is defined as the smallest distinguishable unit of the data i e cell size for raster files data with a fine spatial resolution are used to model phenomena like geometric attributes of forest patches or the density of understory across forest stands whereas data with a coarse spatial resolution correspond to broad scale phenomena with larger spatial extents like ecoregions or climate regions clark et al 2011 holt 2009 in our experiment we sought to apply knowledge gained by analyzing niche models with a set of environmental variables with a coarse resolution to improve a model developed using variables that had a finer resolution 2 materials and methods 2 1 focal species red cockaded woodpecker the red cockaded woodpecker henceforth rcw is a non migratory woodpecker species found along the coasts of the southeastern u s u s fish and wildlife service and costa 2002 in 1970 the species was listed as federally endangered facing three major threats forest management fire suppression and urbanization hanula and engstrom 2000 as an obligate specialist species rcw distributions are spatially bound by distributions of mature longleaf pines individuals excavate cavities in older longleaf pine trees typically 80 120 years old with the heartwood of the tree softened by red heart fungus in coastal pine forests of the southeastern united states smart et al 2012 walters 1991 walters et al 1988 research suggests rcw prefer to construct cavities in taller trees with open understories maintained by fire regimes which are hypothesized to make cavities less accessible for snakes and other predators smart et al 2012 u s fish and wildlife service and costa 2002 walters 1991 conservation efforts and research on the species are important because the species plays a keystone role in its ecosystems an estimated 27 other species will reside in abandoned or usurped cavities the rcw excavates jusino et al 2015 u s fish and wildlife service and costa 2002 2 2 occurrence data and environmental data presence data for the rcw were recorded from 2000 to 2011 and provided by the florida natural areas inventory a non profit research organization at florida state university that maintains state biodiversity inventories fnai 2013 1858 rcw occurrence points within florida s statewide extent were classified in the dataset as active and used to train and test the 30 m model because of the smaller extent of the fine scale model only 222 of these points were used to train and test the 10 m models six of the independent variables used to develop the models in our experiment were provided by the us gap analysis program elevation slope aspect human impact avoidance distance from forest edge and land cover and had a native resolution of 30 m table 1 the florida forest service provided a raster of forest age that also had a native resolution of 30 m we processed lidar data provided by the usgs 3d elevation program average point spacing of 0 36 points m2 to a 10 m raster using common forest metrics with the lidr package in r roussel et al 2017 the 10 m resolution was chosen following a study conducted by zellweger et al 2014 which stated the resolution would result in cells containing a sufficient quantity of lidar points to allow for the preservation of structural attributes of vegetation and habitat lidar forest metrics correspond to three dimensional measures of forest stands some of which are known to affect rcw distribution including the vertical complexity index vci a measure of vegetation height similarity which can correspond to stand age dynamics van ewijk et al 2013 and the percentage of ground points which can be used to measure understory density martinuzzi et al 2009 2 3 methods maxent models were developed using the dismo package in r developed by hijmans et al 2017 using the cross validation approach with 10 model runs the cross validation method was chosen because it uses all presence data provided randomly selected by maxent as either a testing point or training point for each model run during model development phillips et al 2006 we used a commonly employed product of maxent the logistic output a raster which has the same resolution as the model s input variables with values that range from 0 0 to 1 0 that correspond to the similarity of environmental characteristics of each location to the locations where the species was recorded present elith et al 2011 phillips et al 2006 we developed one maxent model with the extent of the state of florida using the variables with a native resolution of 30 m fig 1 we then developed a model with variables from lidar data processed to a resolution of 10 m that had a spatial extent of okaloosa county located along the florida panhandle which used background points from the default background sampling area the entire study area to use the output of the 30 m model to restrict the background sampling area for the 10 m model we averaged the outputs of model runs from the 30 m model and clipped the averaged raster to the spatial extent of the 10 m model okaloosa county we then produced three binary rasters suitable unsuitable from the 30 m resolution model using three thresholds provided with the logistic output of maxent the first two were the minimum maximum values of these thresholds the minimum training presence threshold 0 006 and the equal training sensitivity and specificity threshold 0 3761 the third was the mean value 0 1919 of all logistic thresholds provided by maxent the testing data omission rate is the ratio at which the binary suitable model e g the model after the threshold has been applied identifies cells with presence locations as unsuitable because the rate is sensitive to the threshold the testing omission rate at the maximum threshold was highest 21 16 and was lower at the mean threshold 8 18 while at the minimum threshold there was a 0 testing omission rate i e at this threshold all testing points were predicted suitable we tested our approach with different thresholds based on the rationale that maxent threshold values correspond to different attributes of model performance and because the ecological meaning of the thresholds has been debated liu et al 2005 the different background sampling areas are reported in fig 2 we developed three additional models with the lidar variables and the full presence dataset however during model development we restricted background point sampling to areas predicted unsuitable by the averaged 30 m resolution model at the three thresholds to address the possibility that spatial sampling bias in the occurrence dataset affected models we developed three additional models using the same approach after employing the chessboard sampling method on the presence data which led to 117 occurrence points used in these models one benefit of the chessboard sampling approach is that testing and training samples are spatially separated so that evaluation statistics are not affected by their proximity we presented the diagnostics of models developed with the chessboard sampled presence points alongside those of the models developed with the full set of presence points however all other figures and tables are based on the models with the full presence dataset in order to compare this approach which we will refer to as scale based background sampling sbbs to the common convention of resampling environmental data we developed a resampled variable model with both the original 10 m variables and the 30 m variables resampled to a 10 m resolution with the nearest neighbor technique selected to avoid influencing the model with an interpolation of variable values we assessed the performance and improvement of model performance using the gain of the models the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc the sample size corrected akaike information criterion aicc calculated using the enmeval package in r muscarella et al 2018 and the maximized true skill statistic tssmax calculated using the ecospat package in r broennimann et al 2018 in maxent the gain of the model detailed in eq 1 is central to the machine learning process used to determine the prediction surface when the gain value is exponentiated it is the likelihood ratio of a typical presence point to a typical background point the iterative model development process performed in maxent depends on the gain as the model explores and determines the model s solution when the gain is maximized the solution of the model best discriminates locations with observation points from background point locations the gain is calculated by the following merow et al 2013 the second term in eq 1 is based on the predicted values at background locations through sbbs we expect there will be fewer background points in suitable areas where there are presence data compared with background points randomly sampled through the entirety of the study area thus we will minimize term 2 in eq 1 resulting in a larger model gain eq 1 gain in maxent adapted from merow et al 2013 the first term is the sum of the predicted values at presence locations where m is the number of presence locations z are the environmental variables at presence locations xi and λ is the set of regression coefficients the second term is the sum of predicted values at background locations and reduces the gain as larger values are associated with background locations n are the background locations and q x are the environmental data values across the background area the third term is the regularization coefficient in which β is the regularization coefficient and s2 zj refers to the variance of presence locations on environmental variable j g a i n 1 m i 1 m z x i λ 1 s u m o f p r e d i c t e d s u i t a b i l i t y v a l u e s a t p r e s e n c e l o c a t i o n s log i 1 n q x

frequently employed validation metric for threshold based models and in maxent corresponds to the probability that a presence location chosen at random is ranked by the model as more suitable than a random background location phillips and dudík 2008 auc ranges from 0 to 1 0 with larger numbers indicating a better model fit aicc is an indicator of model fit that penalizes for complexity based on the number of parameters further aicc values are comparable when models are nested versions of one another smaller aicc values indicating a better model which is the case for the models developed with 10 m resolution variables warren and seifert 2014 however because aicc is calculated based on the number of presence points the aicc values between models with the full presence dataset and the chessboard dataset are not comparable additionally we provided the true skill statistic tss which is calculated by sensitivity specificity 1 allouche et al 2006 and thus requires a threshold to calculate however the tssmax is found by determining the highest tss value by testing all thresholds higher tssmax values are used as an indicator of better model performance jiang et al 2018 finally using the default model as a benchmark we compared each of the models developed with sbbs and the model developed with the resampled variables using the warren s i statistic warren s i is reported on a scale from 0 no overlap to 1 identical models and is calculated by summing pairwise differences between the output surfaces at each cell warren et al 2008 3 results generally compared with the 10 m model developed using the default background sampling area fig 3 models developed with sbbs fig 4 found northwestern regions in the county were more suitable whereas the resampled variable model fig 4 found central areas of the county were less suitable all models were in agreement that southern areas in the county had the highest suitability according to warren s i the least similar model outputs to the model using default background sampling was the sbbs model with the minimum threshold i 0 93 while the resampled variable model i 0 96 and the mean i 0 98 and maximum i 0 99 threshold models had higher warren s i values while the default background model found vci 31 4 standard deviations of lidar heights 27 5 the percentage of ground points 16 1 and the mean height of lidar return heights 9 9 were variables with largest contributions to the model restricting the background area resulted in models in which vci played a smaller contribution as the other three variables were determined more important in calculating the model s output model diagnostics in our experiment table 2 indicated that the inclusion of inferences from the broad scale model through sbbs improved the model in comparison with the default background sampling area chessboard sampling the presence data did not affect these results auc minimum threshold 0 989 mean threshold 0 953 maximum threshold 0 937 and gain minimum threshold 3 5 mean threshold 2 15 maximum threshold 1 86 for the three sbbs models were all higher than the auc 0 883 and gain 1 23 of the model developed using the default background area aicc values were smaller for the sbbs models developed with the background restricted at the mean 6927 697 and maximum threshold 6920 259 than the aicc values for model developed with the default background area 6939 013 though the aicc was larger for the model developed with the background restricted at the minimum threshold 7148 733 similarly tssmax values favored the models calibrated with the background restricted by the mean 0 7225 and maximum threshold 0 7494 to the model developed with the default background area 0 6668 however the model developed with the minimum threshold had a lower tssmax 0 6683 than the default background model the resampled variable model performed better than models developed using the sbbs approach with regards to aicc 6833 718 however the auc of this model was smaller than the sbbs approach in all cases 0 903 the tssmax for the resampled variable model 0 7424 preferred this model for the minimum and mean threshold model though the maximum threshold model performed marginally better by this metric 0 7494 finally the gain of the resampled variable model 1 49 was lower than the gains of the models developed with sbbs while comparing the models developed with sbbs we observed that diagnostic measures of model performance were sensitive to the threshold used to restrict the background sampling area auc values favored the minimum threshold the model gain aicc and tssmax favored the models developed with the background restricted by the maximum threshold 4 discussion we provide evidence that sbbs can deliver improved results when developing sdms using spatial data with different resolutions the 10 m models developed with the sbbs approach had higher diagnostic measures than the 10 m model with the default background sampling area further we observed that models developed using variables at their native resolutions yielded similar and in some cases better diagnostic measures compared with a model developed using the conventional approach of resampling variables table 2 variations in the results are useful to better understand the sbbs approach and to help determine which threshold yielded the better model though widely employed the auc is arguably an inflated diagnostic in this experiment particularly because in maxent the background points in lieu of absence points are used to determine the model s specificity hence one reason that the model developed with the minimum threshold background sampling area had the largest auc was that the background points came from the smallest sampling area of the three models in areas predicted the least suitable by the broader scale model despite being developed with more variables the resampled variable model had a lower aicc than the models developed with sbbs of the models developed using sbbs the maximum threshold model had the lowest aicc tssmax was calculated using the presence locations and an equal number of background points which were sampled through the entire study area to determine sensitivity and specificity at all thresholds according to tssmax the maximum threshold model had the highest performance of all the models that we developed one reason the maximum threshold model may have had larger aicc and tssmax is that background points in this model were sampled from a larger and hence more representative area while still being restricted by sbbs thus we hypothesize the model had more information about variables relative to the other two sbbs models to determine suitability and consequently the model had better predictive and discretionary ability because the minimum threshold model had a higher gain and the largest auc and as the maximum threshold model had the smallest aicc and the largest tssmax there may be tradeoffs regarding the selected threshold aspects of model performance e g specificity sensitivity and model diagnostics that should be considered when employing sbbs the information that is provided to maxent in the sbbs approach is fundamentally different than the information provided to maxent in the resampling context when a maxent model is developed using resampled variables e g resampled variables are added to a model additional relationships are determined between the environmental predictors and a set of presence points that has been partitioned as training and testing data by comparison through sbbs the information that is provided to the model is based on relationships between environmental variables and the entire set of presence points which were calculated by multiple model runs in maxent a particular reason sbbs might be preferred to resampling variables is that there is less uncertainty using the variables at their native resolution dixon and earls 2009 though further work to quantify this uncertainty and compare it to models developed with sbbs might help understand the utility of the approach finally while including resampled variables in models provides further information to explain the presence of a species sbbs provides the model with information on species predicted absence which is usually lacking when researchers are working with presence background models the sbbs approach is rooted in mechanical aspects of the maxent model but also carries ecological meaning by comparing the distribution of environmental characteristics visualized using the ggplot package in r developed by wickham 2016 within the background restricted sampling areas and those within the default background sampling area we capture the effect that restricting the background sampling area had on background points and model variables for example by reviewing the 30 m variables fig 5 we show the sbbs approach resulted in fewer background points from areas with older forests and longleaf pine land cover which are known attributes of rcw niche smart et al 2012 walters et al 1988 reviewing the 10 m variables fig 6 confirms that through the sbbs approach fewer background points were selected in areas with similar environmental profiles as the presence points demonstrated using vci the most influential variable in the 10 m model hence with sbbs the distribution of environmental variables at the presence locations and the distribution of these variables at background points were contrasted prior to model development which resulted in improved model performance additionally based on the niche overlap statistics warren s i and differences between model outputs particularly in the northwestern part of the county we found that limiting the background sampling through sbbs can help identify suitable areas for the species that models with default background sampling might underestimate the gain of the models developed with sbbs was larger than the gain of the model with default background sampling and the resampled variable model fig 7 another way that researchers have increased the gain in maxent is by making adjustments to the regularization parameter which is the penalization term 3 in eq 1 the penalty reduces overfitting in models by ensuring that constraints on the independent variables allow for variability the penalty is calculated based on the variance of the species presence on the independent variables multiplied by the regularization multiplier which is a parameter that has been demonstrated to improve model performance when tuned merow et al 2013 radosavljevic and anderson 2014 the modification of the regularization penalty which is based on the environmental characteristics at presence locations is contrasted with sbbs which is instead based on information inferred from the background points future work might compare the effects of sbbs with the tuning of the regularization parameter and other methods that have been proposed to optimize maxent models as well as explore how these methods may complement one another merow et al 2013 phillips and dudík 2008 warren and seifert 2014 while sbbs resulted in better models according to conventional measures of performance future work is needed to confirm the success of the approach one limitation in our study design was that we only tested this approach with one species and further research to ensure the approach is successful when modeling species that have key differences in their spatial ecology i e a niche generalist would help confirm its utility among taxa 5 conclusions we introduced a scale based background sampling approach that can be applied when developing sdms using spatial data with varying resolutions we demonstrated the approach improved models compared to those that sampled background points from the entire study area the default in maxent in our approach we utilized inferences and knowledge gained by analyzing a species distribution at a broad scale to improve models developed at a more local scale by restricting the background sampling area used to develop a maxent model at a local scale the environmental characteristics at background points were more distinct from the environmental characteristics at presence points we showed that this approach resulted in better model diagnostics and evaluated the differences the approach had to the mechanics of the model given the growing accessibility to remote sensing lidar and other environmental data this approach might be particularly useful to researchers who are developing sdms using variables that have different spatial resolutions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements we thank the anonymous reviewers of this

conditions like köppen geiger zones or ecoregions blanchard et al 2015 tererai and wood 2014 webber et al 2011 eliminating areas that are inaccessible for the focal species from the background sampling area elith et al 2010 and by selecting background points only from areas within a set proximity from presence points vanderwal et al 2009 we hypothesized that by removing areas predicted suitable by models at a different scale from the background sampling area during maxent model development the environmental characteristics of the background points and the presence points would be contrasted to a greater degree which would result in improved model performance employing inferences across scales when developing spatial models is an important focus in spatial ecology which bridges theories of ecological processes with multiscale ecological modeling practice miller et al 2004 researchers may need to aggregate local observations to improve their understanding of broad scale patterns or to extrapolate broad scale knowledge to better model local and individual systems bombi and d amen 2012 fernandes et al 2014 miller et al 2004 one scale based characteristic of environmental variables is the spatial resolution which is defined as the smallest distinguishable unit of the data i e cell size for raster files data with a fine spatial resolution are used to model phenomena like geometric attributes of forest patches or the density of understory across forest stands whereas data with a coarse spatial resolution correspond to broad scale phenomena with larger spatial extents like ecoregions or climate regions clark et al 2011 holt 2009 in our experiment we sought to apply knowledge gained by analyzing niche models with a set of environmental variables with a coarse resolution to improve a model developed using variables that had a finer resolution 2 materials and methods 2 1 focal species red cockaded woodpecker the red cockaded woodpecker henceforth rcw is a non migratory woodpecker species found along the coasts of the southeastern u s u s fish and wildlife service and costa 2002 in 1970 the species was listed as federally endangered facing three major threats forest management fire suppression and urbanization hanula and engstrom 2000 as an obligate specialist species rcw distributions are spatially bound by distributions of mature longleaf pines individuals excavate cavities in older longleaf pine trees typically 80 120 years old with the heartwood of the tree softened by red heart fungus in coastal pine forests of the southeastern united states smart et al 2012 walters 1991 walters et al 1988 research suggests rcw prefer to construct cavities in taller trees with open understories maintained by fire regimes which are hypothesized to make cavities less accessible for snakes and other predators smart et al 2012 u s fish and wildlife service and costa 2002 walters 1991 conservation efforts and research on the species are important because the species plays a keystone role in its ecosystems an estimated 27 other species will reside in abandoned or usurped cavities the rcw excavates jusino et al 2015 u s fish and wildlife service and costa 2002 2 2 occurrence data and environmental data presence data for the rcw were recorded from 2000 to 2011 and provided by the florida natural areas inventory a non profit research organization at florida state university that maintains state biodiversity inventories fnai 2013 1858 rcw occurrence points within florida s statewide extent were classified in the dataset as active and used to train and test the 30 m model because of the smaller extent of the fine scale model only 222 of these points were used to train and test the 10 m models six of the independent variables used to develop the models in our experiment were provided by the us gap analysis program elevation slope aspect human impact avoidance distance from forest edge and land cover and had a native resolution of 30 m table 1 the florida forest service provided a raster of forest age that also had a native resolution of 30 m we processed lidar data provided by the usgs 3d elevation program average point spacing of 0 36 points m2 to a 10 m raster using common forest metrics with the lidr package in r roussel et al 2017 the 10 m resolution was chosen following a study conducted by zellweger et al 2014 which stated the resolution would result in cells containing a sufficient quantity of lidar points to allow for the preservation of structural attributes of vegetation and habitat lidar forest metrics correspond to three dimensional measures of forest stands some of which are known to affect rcw distribution including the vertical complexity index vci a measure of vegetation height similarity which can correspond to stand age dynamics van ewijk et al 2013 and the percentage of ground points which can be used to measure understory density martinuzzi et al 2009 2 3 methods maxent models were developed using the dismo package in r developed by hijmans et al 2017 using the cross validation approach with 10 model runs the cross validation method was chosen because it uses all presence data provided randomly selected by maxent as either a testing point or training point for each model run during model development phillips et al 2006 we used a commonly employed product of maxent the logistic output a raster which has the same resolution as the model s input variables with values that range from 0 0 to 1 0 that correspond to the similarity of environmental characteristics of each location to the locations where the species was recorded present elith et al 2011 phillips et al 2006 we developed one maxent model with the extent of the state of florida using the variables with a native resolution of 30 m fig 1 we then developed a model with variables from lidar data processed to a resolution of 10 m that had a spatial extent of okaloosa county located along the florida panhandle which used background points from the default background sampling area the entire study area to use the output of the 30 m model to restrict the background sampling area for the 10 m model we averaged the outputs of model runs from the 30 m model and clipped the averaged raster to the spatial extent of the 10 m model okaloosa county we then produced three binary rasters suitable unsuitable from the 30 m resolution model using three thresholds provided with the logistic output of maxent the first two were the minimum maximum values of these thresholds the minimum training presence threshold 0 006 and the equal training sensitivity and specificity threshold 0 3761 the third was the mean value 0 1919 of all logistic thresholds provided by maxent the testing data omission rate is the ratio at which the binary suitable model e g the model after the threshold has been applied identifies cells with presence locations as unsuitable because the rate is sensitive to the threshold the testing omission rate at the maximum threshold was highest 21 16 and was lower at the mean threshold 8 18 while at the minimum threshold there was a 0 testing omission rate i e at this threshold all testing points were predicted suitable we tested our approach with different thresholds based on the rationale that maxent threshold values correspond to different attributes of model performance and because the ecological meaning of the thresholds has been debated liu et al 2005 the different background sampling areas are reported in fig 2 we developed three additional models with the lidar variables and the full presence dataset however during model development we restricted background point sampling to areas predicted unsuitable by the averaged 30 m resolution model at the three thresholds to address the possibility that spatial sampling bias in the occurrence dataset affected models we developed three additional models using the same approach after employing the chessboard sampling method on the presence data which led to 117 occurrence points used in these models one benefit of the chessboard sampling approach is that testing and training samples are spatially separated so that evaluation statistics are not affected by their proximity we presented the diagnostics of models developed with the chessboard sampled presence points alongside those of the models developed with the full set of presence points however all other figures and tables are based on the models with the full presence dataset in order to compare this approach which we will refer to as scale based background sampling sbbs to the common convention of resampling environmental data we developed a resampled variable model with both the original 10 m variables and the 30 m variables resampled to a 10 m resolution with the nearest neighbor technique selected to avoid influencing the model with an interpolation of variable values we assessed the performance and improvement of model performance using the gain of the models the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc the sample size corrected akaike information criterion aicc calculated using the enmeval package in r muscarella et al 2018 and the maximized true skill statistic tssmax calculated using the ecospat package in r broennimann et al 2018 in maxent the gain of the model detailed in eq 1 is central to the machine learning process used to determine the prediction surface when the gain value is exponentiated it is the likelihood ratio of a typical presence point to a typical background point the iterative model development process performed in maxent depends on the gain as the model explores and determines the model s solution when the gain is maximized the solution of the model best discriminates locations with observation points from background point locations the gain is calculated by the following merow et al 2013 the second term in eq 1 is based on the predicted values at background locations through sbbs we expect there will be fewer background points in suitable areas where there are presence data compared with background points randomly sampled through the entirety of the study area thus we will minimize term 2 in eq 1 resulting in a larger model gain eq 1 gain in maxent adapted from merow et al 2013 the first term is the sum of the predicted values at presence locations where m is the number of presence locations z are the environmental variables at presence locations xi and λ is the set of regression coefficients the second term is the sum of predicted values at background locations and reduces the gain as larger values are associated with background locations n are the background locations and q x are the environmental data values across the background area the third term is the regularization coefficient in which β is the regularization coefficient and s2 zj refers to the variance of presence locations on environmental variable j g a i n 1 m i 1 m z x i λ 1 s u m o f p r e d i c t e d s u i t a b i l i t y v a l u e s a t p r e s e n c e l o c a t i o n s log i 1 n q x

frequently employed validation metric for threshold based models and in maxent corresponds to the probability that a presence location chosen at random is ranked by the model as more suitable than a random background location phillips and dudík 2008 auc ranges from 0 to 1 0 with larger numbers indicating a better model fit aicc is an indicator of model fit that penalizes for complexity based on the number of parameters further aicc values are comparable when models are nested versions of one another smaller aicc values indicating a better model which is the case for the models developed with 10 m resolution variables warren and seifert 2014 however because aicc is calculated based on the number of presence points the aicc values between models with the full presence dataset and the chessboard dataset are not comparable additionally we provided the true skill statistic tss which is calculated by sensitivity specificity 1 allouche et al 2006 and thus requires a threshold to calculate however the tssmax is found by determining the highest tss value by testing all thresholds higher tssmax values are used as an indicator of better model performance jiang et al 2018 finally using the default model as a benchmark we compared each of the models developed with sbbs and the model developed with the resampled variables using the warren s i statistic warren s i is reported on a scale from 0 no overlap to 1 identical models and is calculated by summing pairwise differences between the output surfaces at each cell warren et al 2008 3 results generally compared with the 10 m model developed using the default background sampling area fig 3 models developed with sbbs fig 4 found northwestern regions in the county were more suitable whereas the resampled variable model fig 4 found central areas of the county were less suitable all models were in agreement that southern areas in the county had the highest suitability according to warren s i the least similar model outputs to the model using default background sampling was the sbbs model with the minimum threshold i 0 93 while the resampled variable model i 0 96 and the mean i 0 98 and maximum i 0 99 threshold models had higher warren s i values while the default background model found vci 31 4 standard deviations of lidar heights 27 5 the percentage of ground points 16 1 and the mean height of lidar return heights 9 9 were variables with largest contributions to the model restricting the background area resulted in models in which vci played a smaller contribution as the other three variables were determined more important in calculating the model s output model diagnostics in our experiment table 2 indicated that the inclusion of inferences from the broad scale model through sbbs improved the model in comparison with the default background sampling area chessboard sampling the presence data did not affect these results auc minimum threshold 0 989 mean threshold 0 953 maximum threshold 0 937 and gain minimum threshold 3 5 mean threshold 2 15 maximum threshold 1 86 for the three sbbs models were all higher than the auc 0 883 and gain 1 23 of the model developed using the default background area aicc values were smaller for the sbbs models developed with the background restricted at the mean 6927 697 and maximum threshold 6920 259 than the aicc values for model developed with the default background area 6939 013 though the aicc was larger for the model developed with the background restricted at the minimum threshold 7148 733 similarly tssmax values favored the models calibrated with the background restricted by the mean 0 7225 and maximum threshold 0 7494 to the model developed with the default background area 0 6668 however the model developed with the minimum threshold had a lower tssmax 0 6683 than the default background model the resampled variable model performed better than models developed using the sbbs approach with regards to aicc 6833 718 however the auc of this model was smaller than the sbbs approach in all cases 0 903 the tssmax for the resampled variable model 0 7424 preferred this model for the minimum and mean threshold model though the maximum threshold model performed marginally better by this metric 0 7494 finally the gain of the resampled variable model 1 49 was lower than the gains of the models developed with sbbs while comparing the models developed with sbbs we observed that diagnostic measures of model performance were sensitive to the threshold used to restrict the background sampling area auc values favored the minimum threshold the model gain aicc and tssmax favored the models developed with the background restricted by the maximum threshold 4 discussion we provide evidence that sbbs can deliver improved results when developing sdms using spatial data with different resolutions the 10 m models developed with the sbbs approach had higher diagnostic measures than the 10 m model with the default background sampling area further we observed that models developed using variables at their native resolutions yielded similar and in some cases better diagnostic measures compared with a model developed using the conventional approach of resampling variables table 2 variations in the results are useful to better understand the sbbs approach and to help determine which threshold yielded the better model though widely employed the auc is arguably an inflated diagnostic in this experiment particularly because in maxent the background points in lieu of absence points are used to determine the model s specificity hence one reason that the model developed with the minimum threshold background sampling area had the largest auc was that the background points came from the smallest sampling area of the three models in areas predicted the least suitable by the broader scale model despite being developed with more variables the resampled variable model had a lower aicc than the models developed with sbbs of the models developed using sbbs the maximum threshold model had the lowest aicc tssmax was calculated using the presence locations and an equal number of background points which were sampled through the entire study area to determine sensitivity and specificity at all thresholds according to tssmax the maximum threshold model had the highest performance of all the models that we developed one reason the maximum threshold model may have had larger aicc and tssmax is that background points in this model were sampled from a larger and hence more representative area while still being restricted by sbbs thus we hypothesize the model had more information about variables relative to the other two sbbs models to determine suitability and consequently the model had better predictive and discretionary ability because the minimum threshold model had a higher gain and the largest auc and as the maximum threshold model had the smallest aicc and the largest tssmax there may be tradeoffs regarding the selected threshold aspects of model performance e g specificity sensitivity and model diagnostics that should be considered when employing sbbs the information that is provided to maxent in the sbbs approach is fundamentally different than the information provided to maxent in the resampling context when a maxent model is developed using resampled variables e g resampled variables are added to a model additional relationships are determined between the environmental predictors and a set of presence points that has been partitioned as training and testing data by comparison through sbbs the information that is provided to the model is based on relationships between environmental variables and the entire set of presence points which were calculated by multiple model runs in maxent a particular reason sbbs might be preferred to resampling variables is that there is less uncertainty using the variables at their native resolution dixon and earls 2009 though further work to quantify this uncertainty and compare it to models developed with sbbs might help understand the utility of the approach finally while including resampled variables in models provides further information to explain the presence of a species sbbs provides the model with information on species predicted absence which is usually lacking when researchers are working with presence background models the sbbs approach is rooted in mechanical aspects of the maxent model but also carries ecological meaning by comparing the distribution of environmental characteristics visualized using the ggplot package in r developed by wickham 2016 within the background restricted sampling areas and those within the default background sampling area we capture the effect that restricting the background sampling area had on background points and model variables for example by reviewing the 30 m variables fig 5 we show the sbbs approach resulted in fewer background points from areas with older forests and longleaf pine land cover which are known attributes of rcw niche smart et al 2012 walters et al 1988 reviewing the 10 m variables fig 6 confirms that through the sbbs approach fewer background points were selected in areas with similar environmental profiles as the presence points demonstrated using vci the most influential variable in the 10 m model hence with sbbs the distribution of environmental variables at the presence locations and the distribution of these variables at background points were contrasted prior to model development which resulted in improved model performance additionally based on the niche overlap statistics warren s i and differences between model outputs particularly in the northwestern part of the county we found that limiting the background sampling through sbbs can help identify suitable areas for the species that models with default background sampling might underestimate the gain of the models developed with sbbs was larger than the gain of the model with default background sampling and the resampled variable model fig 7 another way that researchers have increased the gain in maxent is by making adjustments to the regularization parameter which is the penalization term 3 in eq 1 the penalty reduces overfitting in models by ensuring that constraints on the independent variables allow for variability the penalty is calculated based on the variance of the species presence on the independent variables multiplied by the regularization multiplier which is a parameter that has been demonstrated to improve model performance when tuned merow et al 2013 radosavljevic and anderson 2014 the modification of the regularization penalty which is based on the environmental characteristics at presence locations is contrasted with sbbs which is instead based on information inferred from the background points future work might compare the effects of sbbs with the tuning of the regularization parameter and other methods that have been proposed to optimize maxent models as well as explore how these methods may complement one another merow et al 2013 phillips and dudík 2008 warren and seifert 2014 while sbbs resulted in better models according to conventional measures of performance future work is needed to confirm the success of the approach one limitation in our study design was that we only tested this approach with one species and further research to ensure the approach is successful when modeling species that have key differences in their spatial ecology i e a niche generalist would help confirm its utility among taxa 5 conclusions we introduced a scale based background sampling approach that can be applied when developing sdms using spatial data with varying resolutions we demonstrated the approach improved models compared to those that sampled background points from the entire study area the default in maxent in our approach we utilized inferences and knowledge gained by analyzing a species distribution at a broad scale to improve models developed at a more local scale by restricting the background sampling area used to develop a maxent model at a local scale the environmental characteristics at background points were more distinct from the environmental characteristics at presence points we showed that this approach resulted in better model diagnostics and evaluated the differences the approach had to the mechanics of the model given the growing accessibility to remote sensing lidar and other environmental data this approach might be particularly useful to researchers who are developing sdms using variables that have different spatial resolutions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements we thank the anonymous reviewers of this

24949,terrestrial plants seeds spores and pollen are often dispersed by wind likewise most eggs and larvae of marine organisms are dispersed by oceanic currents it was historically believed that the spatial scale at which dispersal occurs was orders of magnitude smaller for plants than for fish however recent empirical estimates of seed and larval dispersal suggest that these dispersal scales are more alike than previously thought the modeling approaches used to simulate aerial and aquatic dispersal are also converging similar biophysical models are developed in which outputs of eulerian models simulating the main physical forcing mechanism wind or currents are used as inputs to lagrangian models that include biological components such as seed terminal velocity or larval vertical migration these biophysical models are then used to simulate trajectories of the biological entities seeds larvae in three dimensions we reflect on these converging trends by first putting them into an historical perspective and then by comparing the physical and biological processes represented in marine larva vs terrestrial seed dispersal models the data used for the models output corroboration and the tools available to perform simulations we conclude that this convergence offers the opportunity to bridge the gap between two scientific communities which are currently largely disconnected more broadly we also see our comparison across systems as a useful way to strengthen the links between aquatic and terrestrial ecology by sharing knowledge methods tools and concepts abbreviations

published an inspiring book on the comparative physics of air and water and the consequences for life in these two media including movement movement is fundamental to life and therefore widely studied to determine why when where and how organisms move holyoak et al 2008 how organisms move depends on their own internal state drivers such as gain energy or look for safety and navigation ability but also on external factors such as the media in which they move nathan et al 2008a external factors may have predominant impact on the movement as e g for terrestrial seed dispersal in the air and larval dispersal in the water terrestrial plant seeds spores pollen fungi and insects are typically dispersed by wind bakker et al 1996 together with other bioaerosols fröhlich nowoisky et al 2016 but can also be dispersed by water or animals similarly most aquatic organisms have planktonic early life stages eggs and larvae which are transported by oceanic currents from spawning to nursery habitats during the larval dispersal stages pineda et al 2007 secor 2015 there are many natural parallels between aerial and aquatic dispersal in both cases dispersal occurs in three dimensions and is largely influenced by a physical process wind or ocean currents respectively however until recently it was believed that one of the significant differences between dispersal of plants and fish was the spatial scale at which dispersal occurs according to kinlan and gaines s 2003 comparative review of propagule dispersal in marine and terrestrial environments the genetically estimated dispersal scales of demersal fish species in the range 1 1000 km is typically orders of magnitude larger than the estimated dispersal scale of terrestrial plants species 0 1 m 10 km this lead to the view of marine systems tending to be open and terrestrial systems being more closed carr et al 2003 this view was challenged dawson and hamner 2008 and direct estimates of fish dispersal gave a more nuanced view levin 2006 for example buston et al 2011 reported a five fold decrease of successful dispersal over a distance from 0 to 1 km for clown anemone fish larvae similarly almany et al 2013 showed that 50 and 95 of coral grouper larvae settled within 10 and 30 km of the spawning aggregation respectively d aloia et al 2015 found that the spatial scale of dispersal for a reef fish was one order of magnitude smaller than previously thought there are several other examples reported in bode et al 2018 the modeling approaches being developed to simulate propagule dispersal in air and sea have also become similar as an illustration of these converging approaches the schematic views proposed by lett et al 2009 and by trakhtenbrot et al 2014 for modeling larval and seed dispersal respectively are essentially the same in both cases outputs of a eulerian model simulating the main physical forcing mechanism currents or wind serve as inputs to a lagrangian model that include biological components e g larval vertical movement seed terminal velocity in the eulerian model the set of equations governing the dynamics of the ocean or the atmosphere are solved numerically on a spatially discrete domain to provide velocity fields of water or air in generally three dimensions over time in the lagrangian or individual based model the biological entities eggs and larvae or seeds are represented as distinct virtual individuals these individuals are tracked over space and time while being transported by the simulated currents or wind the main biological parameters and processes potentially interacting with the physical transport are also explicitly considered in the lagrangian model the resulting eulerian lagrangian or biophysical model is used to simulate the trajectories of the larvae or seeds over the spatial domain fig 1 in this study we reflect on these converging modeling approaches by first putting them into an historical perspective and then by comparing the physical and biological processes represented in marine larva vs terrestrial seed dispersal models the data used for the models output corroboration sensu augusiak et al 2014 and the tools available to perform simulations we finally discuss the opportunity that this convergence offers to bridge the gap between two scientific communities which are currently relatively disconnected more broadly we also see our comparison across systems as a useful way to strengthen the links between aquatic and terrestrial ecology stergiou and browman 2005 by sharing knowledge methods tools and concepts highlighting similarities and differences against which each system can be better evaluated rotjan and idjadi 2013 2 historical perspective theoretical developments in terrestrial and marine ecology started from the same general concepts that internal ecological dynamics such as density dependent relations and competitive interactions determined the persistence of populations and communities steele 1991a b but the large and rapid fluctuations observed in fish stock abundance and fish recruitment lead to the alternative view that external physical processes such as advective and mixing processes in the ocean could actually determine the persistence of marine populations steele 1991b this hypothesis was initially raised by hjort 1914 but most studies on the links between ocean variability and fluctuations in fish populations remained qualitative until the 1970 s werner and quinlan 2002 in the 1970 s and 1980 s several hypotheses such as the match mismatch stable ocean member vragrant and optimal environmental window hypotheses were raised to conceptualize these links houde 2008 it is in that context that bartsch et al 1989 developed the first broadly published physical biological model miller 2007 in order to simulate the dispersal of herring larvae in the north sea bartsch et al s model was still a eulerian model in which the concentration of larvae was simulated over time on a regular spatial grid the eulerian lagrangian modeling approach as illustrated in fig 1a was developed from the mid 1990 s hermann et al 1996 hinckley et al 1996 within the broader context of individual based modeling in ecology huston et al 1988 deangelis and gross 1992 in this approach eggs and larvae were represented as virtual individuals and tracked while being transported lagrangian by the simulated ocean currents delivered on a fixed spatial grid eulerian it has been referred to as biophysical model from the start hermann et al 1996 hinckley et al 1996 although other terms coupled physical biological model in particular were also used later e g miller 2007 werner et al 2007 precisely the physical model is used as a forcing to the biological model both terms emphasize the interdisciplinary nature of the approach requiring to take into account biological and physical processes and parameters miller 2007 published the first review of biophysical models of marine larval dispersal which has just been updated swearer et al 2019 the eulerian lagrangian approach for modeling terrestrial seed dispersal has been applied since 2002 nathan et al 2002 and reviewed by kuparinen 2006 and nathan et al 2011 this approach has also been referred to as biophysical model by zimmer et al 2009 before that models of seed dispersal were mostly phenomenological using dispersal distributions fitted to data collected at fixed locations eulerian approach or using mark recapture and tracking techniques lagrangian approaches nathan et al 2012 the main objective of using biophysical models rather than phenomenological models was to understand and represent explicitly the mechanisms leading to the observed dispersal distributions instead of fitting theoretical distributions to data nathan and muller landau 2000 biophysical models of seed dispersal benefited much from the lagrangian stochastic models developed in the 1980 s and 1990 s by the atmospheric community as detailed below by contrast it is the development of biophysical models of marine organisms dispersal that lead to an increased use of lagrangian stochastic models in oceanography in the 2000 s brickman and smith 2002 this development has generated nearly 100 publications on marine larval dispersal modeling studies every recent year swearer et al 2019 the large majority of these models are eulerian lagrangian although fully eulerian approaches are still being used we refer to runge et al 2005 and kuparinen 2006 for a discussion of lagrangian vs eulerian models of oceanic and wind dispersal respectively journals which published at least 10 papers citing bartsch et al s 1989 seminal work or miller s 2007 review are all aquatic sciences journals table 1 journals which published at least 15 papers citing nathan et al s 2002 seminal work kuparinen s 2006 or nathan et al s 2011 reviews are generalist not plant specific ecological journals table 1 there is therefore no journal in common between these two sets however ecological modelling published 6 papers citing bartsch et al 1989 or miller 2007 and 18 papers citing nathan et al 2002 kuparinen 2006 or nathan et al 2011 among the 685 publications that cited at least one of these 5 papers only one fraker et al 2015 cited bartsch et al 1989 or miller 2007 and nathan et al 2002 kuparinen 2006 or nathan et al 2011 fraker et al 2015 indeed briefly discussed the applicability of dispersal models to both marine and terrestrial organisms none of the 94 publications citing miller 2007 had the word terrestrial in their title abstract or keywords three papers bonte et al 2012 knights et al 2012 moritz et al 2013 among the 81 citing nathan et al 2011 had the word marine in their abstract or keywords bonte et al 2012 is a general review on the costs of dispersal whereas in the two other papers nathan et al 2011 was cited as a general reference for terrestrial or seed dispersal not specifically modeling in conclusion this quick analysis of the literature suggests that the methods used to model larva and seed dispersal converged largely independently of each other of particular interest for our analysis are two publications van dijk et al 2009 corell et al 2012 among the three identified in table 1 that were published in an aquatic sciences journal marine ecology progress series cited nathan et al

papers referred to one or both cowen et al s 2000 2006 paper s although these papers were predominantly published in aquatic sciences journals a significant number of these were published in generalist or ecological journals table 2 still we found only 13 publications the two already identified at the beginning of this paragraph and denny and benedetti cecchi 2012 gaylord et al 2012 2006

2012 identified premises of the converging approaches in modeling dispersal in both media see also dawson and hamner 2008 which we emphasize here 3 physical processes and models lagrangian dispersal of organisms are simulated by wind or current velocity fields these velocity fields are obtained by solving the geophysical fluid dynamics gfd equations on a discretized spatio temporal grid gfd equations include eom 1 eom 4 vallis 2006 the mass continuity equation which is the mathematical derivation of mass conservation of a fluid parcel the momentum equation which is the derivation of newton s second law for a fluid it is based on the navier stokes equations to which is added the coriolis force to account for the earth rotation the thermodynamic equation which is the mathematical derivation of energy conservation of a fluid parcel the equation of state which provides the density of a fluid parcel as a function of the fluid properties the mass continuity and momentum equations are identical for both the atmosphere and the ocean but the thermodynamic and state equations are different between the two fluids these differences originate from the fact that the air is a compressible fluid whereas seawater can be considered as incompressible indeed the density of an air parcel depends on pressure and temperature following the perfect gas law eq 1 1 marshall and plumb 2008 whereas the density of a seawater parcel depends on temperature and salinity not pressure noteworthy there is no exact equation of state for seawater i e there is no oceanic counterpart to the perfect gas law which rather follows semi empirical equations ioc et al 2010 interestingly despite these differences marshall et al 2004 showed that providing variables changes the equations that represent atmospheric and oceanic fluid motions are isomorphic meaning that they can be written following a common framework for instance in the incompressible ocean the flow is non divergent leading to the following equation 1 u x v y w z 0 with u v w the zonal meridional and vertical flow velocities and x z the spatial coordinates the above relationship is not true in the compressible atmosphere nevertheless by changing the vertical coordinate from depth to pressure p and by assuming that the hydrostatic assumption is valid the continuity equation can be rewritten as follows equation 6 12 marshall and plumb 2008 2 u x v y w p 0 therefore the main equations that approximate the circulation of the atmosphere and the ocean are very similar although some additional processes are specific to one fluid or another in addition most work done in atmospheric dispersion are within the so called atmospheric boundary layer where the flow can be assumed to be incompressible garratt 1994 still there is a large number of atmosphere and ocean general circulation models agcms and ogcms respectively which simulate the same physical phenomena but in different ways the models may use different horizontal grids rectilinear curvilinear tripolar tiled unstructured mesh and vertical coordinates systems z coordinate sigma coordinate s coordinate z coordinate for instance the mitgcm model which exploits the isomorphism between the ocean and the atmosphere is discretized on a cubed sphere grid ronchi et al 1996 this discretization method which divides the earth sphere into 6 faces is used to better simulate the atmosphere and ocean of the two poles despite their singularities other agcms such as nicam satoh et al 2014 use a icosahedral grid a tripolar grid is used in the nemo ocean model madec and imbard 1996 it allows to overcome the sole north pole singularity and therefore to simulate the circulation of the arctic ocean the models may also use different numerical schemes to integrate the partial derivative equations in both time euler scheme leapfrog scheme and space depending on the relative positions of the u v t points arakawa and lamb 1977 a last important difference concerns the scientific assumptions that are made during the model construction circulation models that have been constructed for global studies e g nemo hycom for the ocean arpege nicam for the atmosphere have a coarser resolution than circulation models that have been constructed for regional studies e g roms mars for the ocean rams wrf for the atmosphere as a consequence physical processes of small spatial and temporal scales such as cloud formation turbulence and ocean mesoscale eddies can be represented explicitly in regional models but they need to be parameterized in global models because they are smaller than the model horizontal resolution in order to solve numerically the above equations on a discrete spatiotemporal computational grid initial conditions and boundary conditions are needed in ocean simulations the initial conditions are usually the mean temperature and salinity 3d fields derived from observational based datasets such as world ocean atlas https www nodc noaa gov oc5 woa18 whereas ocean current velocities are initialized from rest in atmospheric models initial conditions include the air temperature and relative humidity and wind velocities are initialized from rest boundary conditions are also required since the ocean and the atmosphere form a coupled system interacting at the air sea interface in ocean simulations surface boundary conditions are the turbulent fluxes of heat latent and sensible and momentum wind stress the shortwave and longwave solar fluxes and the freshwater fluxes evaporation precipitation and runoff in atmospheric models surface boundary conditions include the land and sea surface temperature the land composition such as sand vegetation etc and the surface albedo these surface boundary conditions are usually provided by observation based data reanalyzes for regional configurations information about the system at the domain boundaries are also required these lateral boundaries can either be closed i e the domain is surrounded by virtual walls not suitable for atmospheric models or open i e prescribed values encompassing a bigger domain are used despite the common physical basis on which they are based there are therefore differences in the implementation of gcms which explain the large number of physical models that have been used in biophysical models swearer et al 2019 the choice of a specific model and configuration then depends on the question being addressed in particular its spatial extent global or regional study the domain open or closed and time period climatological interannual hindcast forecast of interest and the scales synoptic mesoscale submesoscale of the important physical processes to resolve 4 lagrangian particle dispersion models lagrangian dispersion models were first introduced and studied by the atmospheric community with the aim of predicting the evolution of plumes of pollutants in the atmosphere first well known references for lagrangian stochastic models lsm include wilson et al 1981 sawford 1985 de baas et al 1986 and the classic landmark paper thomson 1987 the reader is also referred to rodean 1996 for a comprehensive review of works and improvements in lsm for atmospheric purposes developments of lsm also came from other fields such as turbulent combustion or single phase flow turbulence modeling pope 1985 1991 1994 and recent works bahlali 2018 bahlali et al 2018 aimed at bridging these developments with atmospheric dispersion applications broadly lagrangian models reproduce the transport of a large number of particles whose evolution of velocities is governed by newton s second law these equations generally involve the eulerian instantaneous fluid velocity fields however due to computational costs these velocity fields and other fields such as pressure temperature turbulence depending on the problem addressed are most often averaged based either on reynolds statistical averaging method or on spatial and or temporal averages consequently in order to close the system of equations the fluctuating part of these fields must be reconstructed this is precisely where lsm come into play lagrangian methods are indeed most often associated with stochastic dispersion models governing the evolution of velocity fields associated with particles this idea was originally proposed by langevin in 1908 who given the random nature of turbulence represented the motion of particles through a stochastic differential equation called the langevin equation lemons and gythiel 1997 brickman and smith 2002 and van sebille et al 2018 are two reviews of lagrangian modeling applied to oceanography the fundamental principles are identical to those of the atmospheric domain although sometimes the models used are zeroth order markov models in which the stochastic term is added to the particle positions rather than to their velocities in first order markov models fundamentally one of the main practical implications of using a zeroth or a first order markov lies in the time or space scales that are considered a first order markov model shows rapid diffusion near the source short times and then tends to follow the diffusive law in the far field long times zeroth order models do not have this property and model the whole dispersion process through a diffusive law in consequence if one is interested in near source modeling i e in the region corresponding to the short time limit where the fully diffusive regime has not been reached yet then the use of a first order markov model is recommended in atmospheric studies this occurs when focusing on the local scale pollutant dispersion around industrial sites for example oceanic dispersion studies generally focus more on the long range transport brickman and smith 2002 which is why zeroth order markov models are more commonly used as they are computationally less demanding döös et al 2011 is an example of both approaches being used in order to compare trajectories of simulated particles and oceanographic drifters starting from a common base lagrangian models can then be developed for several applications according to their own specific properties hence for the dispersal of propagules the relevant biological processes included in the models are described in the following section with a focus on marine larvae and terrestrial seeds 5 biological processes and models once the wind or current velocity fields are available from the atmospheric or oceanic model simulations the minimum information required to set up a biophysical model of terrestrial seed or marine larva dispersal is the time and location of individuals release and the duration of their tracking for terrestrial seeds the duration of transport is the seed passage time nathan et al 2008b which depends on seed terminal velocity and atmospheric stability see below but is often fixed in models based on the duration of experiments conducted jointly with modeling e g 35 days in nathan et al 2002 for marine larvae this duration corresponds to the planktonic larval duration pld which typically ranges from days to months depending on species shanks 2009 but is relatively well established because the end of the pld often corresponds to the metamorphosis of individuals into a stage where they are able to settle this point actually illustrates a major difference between seed dispersal and larval dispersal during their dispersal phase most aquatic organisms develop into different life stages hence most fish develop from egg to yolk sac larva where individuals carry their own food reserves to early larva where they have developed a functional jaw and pigmented eyes that allow them to catch food to late larva where they have fins and are therefore able to swim fig 1b during this development the growing larvae also progressively acquire more abilities to move vertically e g performing diel vertical migration and horizontally e g searching for food and therefore to interact with the physical dispersal processes cowen and sponaugle 2009 leis 2010 this complexity of the marine larval life pineda et al 2009 is reflected by the generally large number of biological parameters and processes included in the biophysical models of larval dispersal such as egg buoyancy larval vertical migration growth mortality and a time period at the end of the pld during which larvae are able to settle fig 1b garavelli et al 2016 for example showed how the successive inclusion of larval growth vertical migration and mortality significantly changed the simulated patterns of larval settlement for a marine gastropod along the chilean coast swimming willis 2011 is less frequently taken into account the onset of schooling also begins early in marine larval development hunter and coyne 1982 nakayama et al 2007 fukuda et al 2010 but has not been directly included in biophysical dispersal models to our knowledge the biological parameters included in biophysical models of seed dispersal are comparatively fewer release height and terminal velocity fig 1c uplift is the most crucial process to represent adequately in these models in order to simulate long distance dispersal events nathan et al 2002 wright et al 2008 damschen et al 2014 formulated the probability of a seed to be uplifted above the forest canopy as a function of canopy height seed vertical position seed terminal velocity mean and standard deviation of the vertical component of wind velocity user friendly tools have been developed to customize and perform marine larva dispersal simulations easily including ichthyop lett et al 2008 ltrans north et al 2008 and cms paris et al 2013 these tools are often compatible with several oceanic model outputs e g roms mars nemo etc for ichthyop they have proven useful to the scientific community as the relatively high number of publications using ichthyop shows 10 to 20 every year since 2012 references at http www ichthyop org publications for simulating marine larval dispersal at various scales ranging from a local lagoon cuif et al 2014 to a whole ocean putman and naro maciel 2013 similarly for atmospheric dispersal simulations tools such as rafles bohrer et al 2009 hysplit rolph et al 2017 and others tesson et al 2016 exist although hysplit for example was mostly designed to simulate the dispersal of atmospheric pollutants it has also been used extensively to simulate the dispersal of insects see makra et al 2018 and the references therein seeds liu et al 2018 spores e g grinn gofron et al 2016 pollen e g garcía mozo et al 2017 and microbes mayol et al 2014 in the air the most recent and spectacular example is the use of hysplit to simulate the overnight wind dispersed trajectories of malaria mosquitoes huestis et al 2019 we are not aware of applications to arthropod aerial dispersal using silk where pre ballooning and ballooning behaviors were described as ways to some extent control the wind dispersal bell et al 2005 6 biophysical model outputs corroboration a direct corroboration of simulated dispersal trajectories is still challenging because it is currently possible to track in situ only a limited number of seeds on land skarpaas et al 2004 and even less larvae in the sea leis et al 2006 the physical part of the biophysical models can be evaluated by comparing trajectories of real vs simulated oceanographic drifters in the sea e g fossette et al 2012 and atmospheric balloons in the air e g riddle et al 2006 the complete biophysical models outputs have been corroborated using similar trapping experiments for larvae e g sponaugle et al 2012 and seeds e g nathan et al 2002 stephenson et al 2007 skarpaas et al 2011 liu et al 2018 alternatively artificial objects mimicking propagules were also used in the sea hrycik et al 2013 and in the air damschen et al 2014 to compare observed and simulated dispersal kernels empirical estimates of ecological connectivity sensu leis et al 2011 using parentage analysis jones et al 2005 planes et al 2009 or chemical marking of calcified structures such as fish otoliths jones et al 2005 thorrold et al 2006 have only recently been compared to marine larva biophysical model outputs cuif 2014 nanninga et al 2015 klein et al 2016 calò et al 2018 by contrast empirical estimates of evolutionary connectivity sensu leis et al 2011 have been extensively used in conjunction with biophysical models of marine larva dispersal in the last 15 years e g gilg and hilbish 2003 gerlach et al 2007 putman and naro maciel 2013 buonomo et al 2017 genetic e g garcía et al 2007 ismail et al 2017 and chemical herrmann et al 2016 marking methods have also been used to estimate dispersal on land and some of these methods are particularly useful to assess rare long distance dispersal events ouborg et al 1999 cain et al 2000 back tracking the putative origin of collected organisms using a biophysical model is also an approach used for both marine mariani et al 2010 holliday et al 2012 bauer et al 2013 fraker et al 2015 calò et al 2018 and terrestrial grinn gofron et al 2016 garcía mozo et al 2017 huestis et al 2019 individuals often as a complement to other genetic or chemical marking methods in recent studies fraker et al 2015 grinn gofron et al 2016 calò et al 2018 7 conclusion our analysis shows that the methods used to model and measure marine larva and terrestrial seed dispersal are converging largely independently of each others more broadly similar biophysical modeling approaches are now largely applied to simulate aquatic and aerial dispersal the physical parts of these models are similar to the extent that the main equations that approximate the circulation of the ocean and the atmosphere are very much alike hence the geostrophic balance between the pressure gradient force and the coriolis force implies that currents follow sea surface height contours in the ocean in the same way as winds follow isobars in the atmosphere the biological parts of the biophysical models depend on their application to marine eggs and larvae or terrestrial seeds spores pollen and insects but the main assumption of weak motion capacity of the biological entities compared to the fluid velocity applies to all the two scientific communities using these approaches are currently still largely disconnected although high impact publications cowen et al 2000 nathan et al 2002 cowen et al 2006 contributed to sharing knowledge between them sharing methods and tools could also help bring these two communities together for example developing a common simulation tool for larval and seed dispersal e g a lagrangian model using outputs from rams for seed dispersal or from roms for larval dispersal using the same methods for identifying subpopulations jacobi et al 2012 or ecological neighbours treml and halpin 2012 and deriving similar graph metrics treml et al 2008 urban et al 2009 thomas et al 2014 and connectivity indices kool et al 2013 from dispersal simulations hence opendrift was recently proposed as an open source generic lagrangian tool for modeling trajectories in the ocean and in the atmosphere dagestad et al 2018 it has just been used to simulate the transport of environmental dna in the ocean andruszkiewicz et al 2019 and could be equally applied to simulate the transport of edna in the air as both media can transport edna over long distances barnes and turner 2016 measuring the same quantities in the field like connectivity self recruitment and local retention kool et al 2013 burgess et al 2014 lett et al 2015 would also be helpful for comparative studies there are a number of similar perspective objectives outlined by the two scientific communities that would legitimate common work including linking the biophysical dispersal models to population dynamics models e g carson et al 2011 nuttle and haefner 2005 and assessing the value of these models to evaluate spatial managements plans like marine reserves white et al 2014 and terrestrial corridors damschen et al 2014 biophysical models applied to plants dispersed by ocean currents such as in mangroves van der stocken et al 2019 and coastal dunes or by overland flows thompson et al 2014 could play a critical role in bringing these two communities together hence a promising modeling approach combining oceanic and aerial dispersal was recently applied to simulate trajectories of mangrove propagules for species with different sensitivities to wind van der stocken and menemenlis 2017 similarly our comparative study across systems is particularly relevant for driftwood and other drifting vegetation debris hosting both terrestrial and marine dispersers de la peña et al 2011 rotjan and idjadi 2013 and for bioparticles of marine origin dispersing into the atmosphere wilson et al 2015 fröhlich nowoisky et al 2016 mayol et al 2017 there is also an opportunity to aggregate other scientific communities that begin using biophysical models to study the dispersal of aquatic or aerial plankton e g in freshwater lakes ludsin et al 2014 we hope that our study highlighting the converging approaches used to model the dispersal of propagules in marine and terrestrial environments will also contribute to the development of closer ties between these scientific communities in the future and thereby participate to a unified research on movement ecology nathan et al 2008a in line with previous calls stergiou and browman 2005 menge et al 2009 webb 2012 rotjan

24949,terrestrial plants seeds spores and pollen are often dispersed by wind likewise most eggs and larvae of marine organisms are dispersed by oceanic currents it was historically believed that the spatial scale at which dispersal occurs was orders of magnitude smaller for plants than for fish however recent empirical estimates of seed and larval dispersal suggest that these dispersal scales are more alike than previously thought the modeling approaches used to simulate aerial and aquatic dispersal are also converging similar biophysical models are developed in which outputs of eulerian models simulating the main physical forcing mechanism wind or currents are used as inputs to lagrangian models that include biological components such as seed terminal velocity or larval vertical migration these biophysical models are then used to simulate trajectories of the biological entities seeds larvae in three dimensions we reflect on these converging trends by first putting them into an historical perspective and then by comparing the physical and biological processes represented in marine larva vs terrestrial seed dispersal models the data used for the models output corroboration and the tools available to perform simulations we conclude that this convergence offers the opportunity to bridge the gap between two scientific communities which are currently largely disconnected more broadly we also see our comparison across systems as a useful way to strengthen the links between aquatic and terrestrial ecology by sharing knowledge methods tools and concepts abbreviations

published an inspiring book on the comparative physics of air and water and the consequences for life in these two media including movement movement is fundamental to life and therefore widely studied to determine why when where and how organisms move holyoak et al 2008 how organisms move depends on their own internal state drivers such as gain energy or look for safety and navigation ability but also on external factors such as the media in which they move nathan et al 2008a external factors may have predominant impact on the movement as e g for terrestrial seed dispersal in the air and larval dispersal in the water terrestrial plant seeds spores pollen fungi and insects are typically dispersed by wind bakker et al 1996 together with other bioaerosols fröhlich nowoisky et al 2016 but can also be dispersed by water or animals similarly most aquatic organisms have planktonic early life stages eggs and larvae which are transported by oceanic currents from spawning to nursery habitats during the larval dispersal stages pineda et al 2007 secor 2015 there are many natural parallels between aerial and aquatic dispersal in both cases dispersal occurs in three dimensions and is largely influenced by a physical process wind or ocean currents respectively however until recently it was believed that one of the significant differences between dispersal of plants and fish was the spatial scale at which dispersal occurs according to kinlan and gaines s 2003 comparative review of propagule dispersal in marine and terrestrial environments the genetically estimated dispersal scales of demersal fish species in the range 1 1000 km is typically orders of magnitude larger than the estimated dispersal scale of terrestrial plants species 0 1 m 10 km this lead to the view of marine systems tending to be open and terrestrial systems being more closed carr et al 2003 this view was challenged dawson and hamner 2008 and direct estimates of fish dispersal gave a more nuanced view levin 2006 for example buston et al 2011 reported a five fold decrease of successful dispersal over a distance from 0 to 1 km for clown anemone fish larvae similarly almany et al 2013 showed that 50 and 95 of coral grouper larvae settled within 10 and 30 km of the spawning aggregation respectively d aloia et al 2015 found that the spatial scale of dispersal for a reef fish was one order of magnitude smaller than previously thought there are several other examples reported in bode et al 2018 the modeling approaches being developed to simulate propagule dispersal in air and sea have also become similar as an illustration of these converging approaches the schematic views proposed by lett et al 2009 and by trakhtenbrot et al 2014 for modeling larval and seed dispersal respectively are essentially the same in both cases outputs of a eulerian model simulating the main physical forcing mechanism currents or wind serve as inputs to a lagrangian model that include biological components e g larval vertical movement seed terminal velocity in the eulerian model the set of equations governing the dynamics of the ocean or the atmosphere are solved numerically on a spatially discrete domain to provide velocity fields of water or air in generally three dimensions over time in the lagrangian or individual based model the biological entities eggs and larvae or seeds are represented as distinct virtual individuals these individuals are tracked over space and time while being transported by the simulated currents or wind the main biological parameters and processes potentially interacting with the physical transport are also explicitly considered in the lagrangian model the resulting eulerian lagrangian or biophysical model is used to simulate the trajectories of the larvae or seeds over the spatial domain fig 1 in this study we reflect on these converging modeling approaches by first putting them into an historical perspective and then by comparing the physical and biological processes represented in marine larva vs terrestrial seed dispersal models the data used for the models output corroboration sensu augusiak et al 2014 and the tools available to perform simulations we finally discuss the opportunity that this convergence offers to bridge the gap between two scientific communities which are currently relatively disconnected more broadly we also see our comparison across systems as a useful way to strengthen the links between aquatic and terrestrial ecology stergiou and browman 2005 by sharing knowledge methods tools and concepts highlighting similarities and differences against which each system can be better evaluated rotjan and idjadi 2013 2 historical perspective theoretical developments in terrestrial and marine ecology started from the same general concepts that internal ecological dynamics such as density dependent relations and competitive interactions determined the persistence of populations and communities steele 1991a b but the large and rapid fluctuations observed in fish stock abundance and fish recruitment lead to the alternative view that external physical processes such as advective and mixing processes in the ocean could actually determine the persistence of marine populations steele 1991b this hypothesis was initially raised by hjort 1914 but most studies on the links between ocean variability and fluctuations in fish populations remained qualitative until the 1970 s werner and quinlan 2002 in the 1970 s and 1980 s several hypotheses such as the match mismatch stable ocean member vragrant and optimal environmental window hypotheses were raised to conceptualize these links houde 2008 it is in that context that bartsch et al 1989 developed the first broadly published physical biological model miller 2007 in order to simulate the dispersal of herring larvae in the north sea bartsch et al s model was still a eulerian model in which the concentration of larvae was simulated over time on a regular spatial grid the eulerian lagrangian modeling approach as illustrated in fig 1a was developed from the mid 1990 s hermann et al 1996 hinckley et al 1996 within the broader context of individual based modeling in ecology huston et al 1988 deangelis and gross 1992 in this approach eggs and larvae were represented as virtual individuals and tracked while being transported lagrangian by the simulated ocean currents delivered on a fixed spatial grid eulerian it has been referred to as biophysical model from the start hermann et al 1996 hinckley et al 1996 although other terms coupled physical biological model in particular were also used later e g miller 2007 werner et al 2007 precisely the physical model is used as a forcing to the biological model both terms emphasize the interdisciplinary nature of the approach requiring to take into account biological and physical processes and parameters miller 2007 published the first review of biophysical models of marine larval dispersal which has just been updated swearer et al 2019 the eulerian lagrangian approach for modeling terrestrial seed dispersal has been applied since 2002 nathan et al 2002 and reviewed by kuparinen 2006 and nathan et al 2011 this approach has also been referred to as biophysical model by zimmer et al 2009 before that models of seed dispersal were mostly phenomenological using dispersal distributions fitted to data collected at fixed locations eulerian approach or using mark recapture and tracking techniques lagrangian approaches nathan et al 2012 the main objective of using biophysical models rather than phenomenological models was to understand and represent explicitly the mechanisms leading to the observed dispersal distributions instead of fitting theoretical distributions to data nathan and muller landau 2000 biophysical models of seed dispersal benefited much from the lagrangian stochastic models developed in the 1980 s and 1990 s by the atmospheric community as detailed below by contrast it is the development of biophysical models of marine organisms dispersal that lead to an increased use of lagrangian stochastic models in oceanography in the 2000 s brickman and smith 2002 this development has generated nearly 100 publications on marine larval dispersal modeling studies every recent year swearer et al 2019 the large majority of these models are eulerian lagrangian although fully eulerian approaches are still being used we refer to runge et al 2005 and kuparinen 2006 for a discussion of lagrangian vs eulerian models of oceanic and wind dispersal respectively journals which published at least 10 papers citing bartsch et al s 1989 seminal work or miller s 2007 review are all aquatic sciences journals table 1 journals which published at least 15 papers citing nathan et al s 2002 seminal work kuparinen s 2006 or nathan et al s 2011 reviews are generalist not plant specific ecological journals table 1 there is therefore no journal in common between these two sets however ecological modelling published 6 papers citing bartsch et al 1989 or miller 2007 and 18 papers citing nathan et al 2002 kuparinen 2006 or nathan et al 2011 among the 685 publications that cited at least one of these 5 papers only one fraker et al 2015 cited bartsch et al 1989 or miller 2007 and nathan et al 2002 kuparinen 2006 or nathan et al 2011 fraker et al 2015 indeed briefly discussed the applicability of dispersal models to both marine and terrestrial organisms none of the 94 publications citing miller 2007 had the word terrestrial in their title abstract or keywords three papers bonte et al 2012 knights et al 2012 moritz et al 2013 among the 81 citing nathan et al 2011 had the word marine in their abstract or keywords bonte et al 2012 is a general review on the costs of dispersal whereas in the two other papers nathan et al 2011 was cited as a general reference for terrestrial or seed dispersal not specifically modeling in conclusion this quick analysis of the literature suggests that the methods used to model larva and seed dispersal converged largely independently of each other of particular interest for our analysis are two publications van dijk et al 2009 corell et al 2012 among the three identified in table 1 that were published in an aquatic sciences journal marine ecology progress series cited nathan et al 2002 but not bartsch et al 1989 nor miller 2007 instead they referred to cowen et al 2000 2006 the two most cited publications using biophysical models of larval dispersal indeed a total of 1357 papers referred to one or both cowen et al s 2000 2006 paper s although these papers were predominantly published in aquatic sciences journals a significant number of these were published in generalist or ecological journals table 2 still we found only 13 publications the two already identified at the beginning of this paragraph and denny and benedetti cecchi 2012 gaylord et al 2012 2006

newton s second law for a fluid it is based on the navier stokes equations to which is added the coriolis force to account for the earth rotation the thermodynamic equation which is the mathematical derivation of energy conservation of a fluid parcel the equation of state which provides the density of a fluid parcel as a function of the fluid properties the mass continuity and momentum equations are identical for both the atmosphere and the ocean but the thermodynamic and state equations are different between the two fluids these differences originate from the fact that the air is a compressible fluid whereas seawater can be considered as incompressible indeed the density of an air parcel depends on pressure and temperature following the perfect gas law eq 1 1 marshall and plumb 2008 whereas the density of a seawater parcel depends on temperature and salinity not pressure noteworthy there is no exact equation of state for seawater i e there is no oceanic counterpart to the perfect gas law which rather follows semi empirical equations ioc et al 2010 interestingly despite these differences marshall et al 2004 showed that providing variables changes the equations that represent atmospheric and oceanic fluid motions are isomorphic meaning that they can be written following a common framework for instance in the incompressible ocean the flow is non divergent leading to the following equation 1 u x v y w z 0 with u v w the zonal meridional and vertical flow velocities and x z the spatial coordinates the above relationship is not true in the compressible atmosphere nevertheless by changing the vertical coordinate from depth to pressure p and by assuming that the hydrostatic assumption is valid the continuity equation can be rewritten as follows equation 6 12 marshall and plumb 2008 2 u x v y w p 0 therefore the main equations that approximate the circulation of the atmosphere and the ocean are very similar although some additional processes are specific to one fluid or another in addition most work done in atmospheric dispersion are within the so called atmospheric boundary layer where the flow can be assumed to be incompressible garratt 1994 still there is a large number of atmosphere and ocean general circulation models agcms and ogcms respectively which simulate the same physical phenomena but in different ways the models may use different horizontal grids rectilinear curvilinear tripolar tiled unstructured mesh and vertical coordinates systems z coordinate sigma coordinate s coordinate z coordinate for instance the mitgcm model which exploits the isomorphism between the ocean and the atmosphere is discretized on a cubed sphere grid ronchi et al 1996 this discretization method which divides the earth sphere into 6 faces is used to better simulate the atmosphere and ocean of the two poles despite their singularities other agcms such as nicam satoh et al 2014 use a icosahedral grid a tripolar grid is used in the nemo ocean model madec and imbard 1996 it allows to overcome the sole north pole singularity and therefore to simulate the circulation of the arctic ocean the models may also use different numerical schemes to integrate the partial derivative equations in both time euler scheme leapfrog scheme and space depending on the relative positions of the u v t points arakawa and lamb 1977 a last important difference concerns the scientific assumptions that are made during the model construction circulation models that have been constructed for global studies e g nemo hycom for the ocean arpege nicam for the atmosphere have a coarser resolution than circulation models that have been constructed for regional studies e g roms mars for the ocean rams wrf for the atmosphere as a consequence physical processes of small spatial and temporal scales such as cloud formation turbulence and ocean mesoscale eddies can be represented explicitly in regional models but they need to be parameterized in global models because they are smaller than the model horizontal resolution in order to solve numerically the above equations on a discrete spatiotemporal computational grid initial conditions and boundary conditions are needed in ocean simulations the initial conditions are usually the mean temperature and salinity 3d fields derived from observational based datasets such as world ocean atlas https www nodc noaa gov oc5 woa18 whereas ocean current velocities are initialized from rest in atmospheric models initial conditions include the air temperature and relative humidity and wind velocities are initialized from rest boundary conditions are also required since the ocean and the atmosphere form a coupled system interacting at the air sea interface in ocean simulations surface boundary conditions are the turbulent fluxes of heat latent and sensible and momentum wind stress the shortwave and longwave solar fluxes and the freshwater fluxes evaporation precipitation and runoff in atmospheric models surface boundary conditions include the land and sea surface temperature the land composition such as sand vegetation etc and the surface albedo these surface boundary conditions are usually provided by observation based data reanalyzes for regional configurations information about the system at the domain boundaries are also required these lateral boundaries can either be closed i e the domain is surrounded by virtual walls not suitable for atmospheric models or open i e prescribed values encompassing a bigger domain are used despite the common physical basis on which they are based there are therefore differences in the implementation of gcms which explain the large number of physical models that have been used in biophysical models swearer et al 2019 the choice of a specific model and configuration then depends on the question being addressed in particular its spatial extent global or regional study the domain open or closed and time period climatological interannual hindcast forecast of interest and the scales synoptic mesoscale submesoscale of the important physical processes to resolve 4 lagrangian particle dispersion models lagrangian dispersion models were first introduced and studied by the atmospheric community with the aim of predicting the evolution of plumes of pollutants in the atmosphere first well known references for lagrangian stochastic models lsm include wilson et al 1981 sawford 1985 de baas et al 1986 and the classic landmark paper thomson 1987 the reader is also referred to rodean 1996 for a comprehensive review of works and improvements in lsm for atmospheric purposes developments of lsm also came from other fields such as turbulent combustion or single phase flow turbulence modeling pope 1985 1991 1994 and recent works bahlali 2018 bahlali et al 2018 aimed at bridging these developments with atmospheric dispersion applications broadly lagrangian models reproduce the transport of a large number of particles whose evolution of velocities is governed by newton s second law these equations generally involve the eulerian instantaneous fluid velocity fields however due to computational costs these velocity fields and other fields such as pressure temperature turbulence depending on the problem addressed are most often averaged based either on reynolds statistical averaging method or on spatial and or temporal averages consequently in order to close the system of equations the fluctuating part of these fields must be reconstructed this is precisely where lsm come into play lagrangian methods are indeed most often associated with stochastic dispersion models governing the evolution of velocity fields associated with particles this idea was originally proposed by langevin in 1908 who given the random nature of turbulence represented the motion of particles through a stochastic differential equation called the langevin equation lemons and gythiel 1997 brickman and smith 2002 and van sebille et al 2018 are two reviews of lagrangian modeling applied to oceanography the fundamental principles are identical to those of the atmospheric domain although sometimes the models used are zeroth order markov models in which the stochastic term is added to the particle positions rather than to their velocities in first order markov models fundamentally one of the main practical implications of using a zeroth or a first order markov lies in the time or space scales that are considered a first order markov model shows rapid diffusion near the source short times and then tends to follow the diffusive law in the far field long times zeroth order models do not have this property and model the whole dispersion process through a diffusive law in consequence if one is interested in near source modeling i e in the region corresponding to the short time limit where the fully diffusive regime has not been reached yet then the use of a first order markov model is recommended in atmospheric studies this occurs when focusing on the local scale pollutant dispersion around industrial sites for example oceanic dispersion studies generally focus more on the long range transport brickman and smith 2002 which is why zeroth order markov models are more commonly used as they are computationally less demanding döös et al 2011 is an example of both approaches being used in order to compare trajectories of simulated particles and oceanographic drifters starting from a common base lagrangian models can then be developed for several applications according to their own specific properties hence for the dispersal of propagules the relevant biological processes included in the models are described in the following section with a focus on marine larvae and terrestrial seeds 5 biological processes and models once the wind or current velocity fields are available from the atmospheric or oceanic model simulations the minimum information required to set up a biophysical model of terrestrial seed or marine larva dispersal is the time and location of individuals release and the duration of their tracking for terrestrial seeds the duration of transport is the seed passage time nathan et al 2008b which depends on seed terminal velocity and atmospheric stability see below but is often fixed in models based on the duration of experiments conducted jointly with modeling e g 35 days in nathan et al 2002 for marine larvae this duration corresponds to the planktonic larval duration pld which typically ranges from days to months depending on species shanks 2009 but is relatively well established because the end of the pld often corresponds to the metamorphosis of individuals into a stage where they are able to settle this point actually illustrates a major difference between seed dispersal and larval dispersal during their dispersal phase most aquatic organisms develop into different life stages hence most fish develop from egg to yolk sac larva where individuals carry their own food reserves to early larva where they have developed a functional jaw and pigmented eyes that allow them to catch food to late larva where they have fins and are therefore able to swim fig 1b during this development the growing larvae also progressively acquire more abilities to move vertically e g performing diel vertical migration and horizontally e g searching for food and therefore to interact with the physical dispersal processes cowen and sponaugle 2009 leis 2010 this complexity of the marine larval life pineda et al 2009 is reflected by the generally large number of biological parameters and processes included in the biophysical models of larval dispersal such as egg buoyancy larval vertical migration growth mortality and a time period at the end of the pld during which larvae are able to settle fig 1b garavelli et al 2016 for example showed how the successive inclusion of larval growth vertical migration and mortality significantly changed the simulated patterns of larval settlement for a marine gastropod along the chilean coast swimming willis 2011 is less frequently taken into account the onset of schooling also begins early in marine larval development hunter and coyne 1982 nakayama et al 2007 fukuda et al 2010 but has not been directly included in biophysical dispersal models to our knowledge the biological parameters included in biophysical models of seed dispersal are comparatively fewer release height and terminal velocity fig 1c uplift is the most crucial process to represent adequately in these models in order to simulate long distance dispersal events nathan et al 2002 wright et al 2008 damschen et al 2014 formulated the probability of a seed to be uplifted above the forest canopy as a function of canopy height seed vertical position seed terminal velocity mean and standard deviation of the vertical component of wind velocity user friendly tools have been developed to customize and perform marine larva dispersal simulations easily including ichthyop lett et al 2008 ltrans north et al 2008 and cms paris et al 2013 these tools are often compatible with several oceanic model outputs e g roms mars nemo etc for ichthyop they have proven useful to the scientific community as the relatively high number of publications using ichthyop shows 10 to 20 every year since 2012 references at http www ichthyop org publications for simulating marine larval dispersal at various scales ranging from a local lagoon cuif et al 2014 to a whole ocean putman and naro maciel 2013 similarly for atmospheric dispersal simulations tools such as rafles bohrer et al 2009 hysplit rolph et al 2017 and others tesson et al 2016 exist although hysplit for example was mostly designed to simulate the dispersal of atmospheric pollutants it has also been used extensively to simulate the dispersal of insects see makra et al 2018 and the references therein seeds liu et al 2018 spores e g grinn gofron et al 2016 pollen e g garcía mozo et al 2017 and microbes mayol et al 2014 in the air the most recent and spectacular example is the use of hysplit to simulate the overnight wind dispersed trajectories of malaria mosquitoes huestis et al 2019 we are not aware of applications to arthropod aerial dispersal using silk where pre ballooning and ballooning behaviors were described as ways to some extent control the wind dispersal bell et al 2005 6 biophysical model outputs corroboration a direct corroboration of simulated dispersal trajectories is still challenging because it is currently possible to track in situ only a limited number of seeds on land skarpaas et al 2004 and even less larvae in the sea leis et al 2006 the physical part of the biophysical models can be evaluated by comparing trajectories of real vs simulated oceanographic drifters in the sea e g fossette et al 2012 and atmospheric balloons in the air e g riddle et al 2006 the complete biophysical models outputs have been corroborated using similar trapping experiments for larvae e g sponaugle et al 2012 and seeds e g nathan et al 2002 stephenson et al 2007 skarpaas et al 2011 liu et al 2018 alternatively artificial objects mimicking propagules were also used in the sea hrycik et al 2013 and in the air damschen et al 2014 to compare observed and simulated dispersal kernels empirical estimates of ecological connectivity sensu leis et al 2011 using parentage analysis jones et al 2005 planes et al 2009 or chemical marking of calcified structures such as fish otoliths jones et al 2005 thorrold et al 2006 have only recently been compared to marine larva biophysical model outputs cuif 2014 nanninga et al 2015 klein et al 2016 calò et al 2018 by contrast empirical estimates of evolutionary connectivity sensu leis et al 2011 have been extensively used in conjunction with biophysical models of marine larva dispersal in the last 15 years e g gilg and hilbish 2003 gerlach et al 2007 putman and naro maciel 2013 buonomo et al 2017 genetic e g garcía et al 2007 ismail et al 2017 and chemical herrmann et al 2016 marking methods have also been used to estimate dispersal on land and some of these methods are particularly useful to assess rare long distance dispersal events ouborg et al 1999 cain et al 2000 back tracking the putative origin of collected organisms using a biophysical model is also an approach used for both marine mariani et al 2010 holliday et al 2012 bauer et al 2013 fraker et al 2015 calò et al 2018 and terrestrial grinn gofron et al 2016 garcía mozo et al 2017 huestis et al 2019 individuals often as a complement to other genetic or chemical marking methods in recent studies fraker et al 2015 grinn gofron et al 2016 calò et al 2018 7 conclusion our analysis shows that the methods used to model and measure marine larva and terrestrial seed dispersal are converging largely independently of each others more broadly similar biophysical modeling approaches are now largely applied to simulate aquatic and aerial dispersal the physical parts of these models are similar to the extent that the main equations that approximate the circulation of the ocean and the atmosphere are very much alike hence the geostrophic balance between the pressure gradient force and the coriolis force implies that currents follow sea surface height contours in the ocean in the same way as winds follow isobars in the atmosphere the biological parts of the biophysical models depend on their application to marine eggs and larvae or terrestrial seeds spores pollen and insects but the main assumption of weak motion capacity of the biological entities compared to the fluid velocity applies to all the two scientific communities using these approaches are currently still largely disconnected although high impact publications cowen et al 2000 nathan et al 2002 cowen et al 2006 contributed to sharing knowledge between them sharing methods and tools could also help bring these two communities together for example developing a common simulation tool for larval and seed dispersal e g a lagrangian model using outputs from rams for seed dispersal or from roms for larval dispersal using the same methods for identifying subpopulations jacobi et al 2012 or ecological neighbours treml and halpin 2012 and deriving similar graph metrics treml et al 2008 urban et al 2009 thomas et al 2014 and connectivity indices kool et al 2013 from dispersal simulations hence opendrift was recently proposed as an open source generic lagrangian tool for modeling trajectories in the ocean and in the atmosphere dagestad et al 2018 it has just been used to simulate the transport of environmental dna in the ocean andruszkiewicz et al 2019 and could be equally applied to simulate the transport of edna in the air as both media can transport edna over long distances barnes and turner 2016 measuring the same quantities in the field like connectivity self recruitment and local retention kool et al 2013 burgess et al 2014 lett et al 2015 would also be helpful for comparative studies there are a number of similar perspective objectives outlined by the two scientific communities that would legitimate common work including linking the biophysical dispersal models to population dynamics models e g carson et al 2011 nuttle and haefner 2005 and assessing the value of these models to evaluate spatial managements plans like marine reserves white et al 2014 and terrestrial corridors damschen et al 2014 biophysical models applied to plants dispersed by ocean currents such as in mangroves van der stocken et al 2019 and coastal dunes or by overland flows thompson et al 2014 could play a critical role in bringing these two communities together hence a promising modeling approach combining oceanic and aerial dispersal was recently applied to simulate trajectories of mangrove propagules for species with different sensitivities to wind van der stocken and menemenlis 2017 similarly our comparative study across systems is particularly relevant for driftwood and other drifting vegetation debris hosting both terrestrial and marine dispersers de la peña et al 2011 rotjan and idjadi 2013 and for bioparticles of marine origin dispersing into the atmosphere wilson et al 2015 fröhlich nowoisky et al 2016 mayol et al 2017 there is also an opportunity to aggregate other scientific communities that begin using biophysical models to study the dispersal of aquatic or aerial plankton e g in freshwater lakes ludsin et al 2014 we hope that our study highlighting the converging approaches used to model the dispersal of propagules in marine and terrestrial environments will also contribute to the development of closer ties between these scientific communities in the future and thereby participate to a unified research on movement ecology nathan et al 2008a in line with previous calls stergiou and browman 2005 menge et al 2009 webb 2012 rotjan and idjadi 2013 we also expect this study to strengthen the links between marine and terrestrial ecologists author contributions cl analyzed and interpreted the wos citations data nb was the major
