the bojnourd watershed the bojnourd watershed is located in the northeast of iran which covers 65 5 km2 of the north khorasan province area there are 11 extracting wells in the region annual water extraction from the alluvial aquifer in the area is used for agriculture drinking sanitary and industrial consumptions in this research groundwater quantity modeling including calibration and verification by gms software had been performed in the quality modeling stage pollution contours for electrical conductivity were mapped and analyzed by mt3dms the spread of salinity pollutants in the aquifer was predicted for 15 years by mt3dms which is a 3d modular software for advection dispersion molecular diffusion chemical reaction and solute absorption simulation the purpose of this research is to simulate the electrical conductivity ec on the catchment and to predict the future trends of ec changes with mt3dms software therefore in this study we generated two different scenarios in this model assuming current situations and simulating tds as the first scenario and implementing municipal sewage systems on the whole city as the second scenario for 15 years the results showed that the discharge of solid waste in the landfill site and domestic wastewater would severely affect the groundwater quality while implementing the municipal sewage system will improve the quality of groundwater significantly in the period of 15 years graphical abstract image 1 keywords bojnourd watershed groundwater modeling mt3dms 1 introduction groundwater resources are the largest freshwater storages in areas where surface water resources are limited and are not easily accessible groundwater resources can be exploited to supply water for agricultural and industrial activities iran is

increase occurring in cities urban areas are considered a powerful economic engine and the long term sustainability of urban regions depends on water supplies urbanization affects the quantity and quality of water supplies this effect in metropolitan areas leads to high demand for groundwater resources underground resources are crucial in arid countries such as iran therefore quantitative and qualitative studies are critical in the urban area a short term and long term study of groundwater quality changes due to increased groundwater withdrawal the input of industrial wastewater and urban wastewater and agricultural reuse and management of information for sustainable urban water management requires providing groundwater quality models in the urban areas the basin of the bojnourd plain is located almost in the center of north khorasan province the alluvial aquifer of bojnourd plain with an area of 65 2 km2 is one of the smallest alluvial aquifers in northern khorasan province and bojnourd city covers a large part more than 60 of these aquifers the heights surround almost the plain of bojnourd the outlet of plain is located in the eastern part of the region where the village of babaaman exists surface flows and streams in this area passing the southern and northern heights eventually move into the alluvial aquifer of bojnourd plain and pass toward through the east of the region and leave the plain to join atrak river the average rainfall in bojnourd area with an average elevation of 1463 m above sea level is estimated to be 293 8 mm year also this plain with an average elevation of 1175 m from sea level has a mean rainfall of 275 45 mm year and other places in this region with an average elevation of 1625 m have an annual rainfall of 306 93 mm moreover an area with 10 ha width is located in the eastern part of the aquifer 3 km far from the village of bagherkhaan where landfill is located and used to dispose of the solid waste produced by humans in urban and rural areas ziaei and mohammadi 2016 shallow depth of groundwater and urban wastewater disruptions has caused the elevation of groundwater levels to increase which resulted in many problems for the city therefore it is essential that the modeling of this reservoir predicts its future behavior as much as possible and presents managerial solutions to address potential problems due to the shallow depth of groundwater in the plain 10 m 90 m and the importance of this region in drinking water in bojnourd qualitative modeling is also required to determine the qualities of the aquifer well

in another section the validation and prediction of the proposed model are investigated eventually the conclusion is presented in the last chapter 2 methods and modeling 2 1 study area bojnourd plain basin is located almost in the center of north khorasan province fig 1 bojnourd plain alluvial aquifer with an area of 2 65 km2 is one of the smallest alluvial aquifers in north khorasan province and bojnourd city covers more than 60 of the alluvial aquifer the heights are almost all around the bojnourd plain the outlet of this plain is in the eastern part of the village of babaman the surface watercourse and streams in this area traversing the southern and northern heights pass into the alluvial aquifer of bojnourd plain and finally moves toward the east to the atrak river the average rainfall of the study area of bojnurd with an average altitude of 1463 m from sea level is estimated to be 293 8 mm in a year of which plain with an average height of 1175 m has an average of 270 45 mm rainfall and the plain with an average altitude of 1625 m has an average of precipitation is 306 93 mm per year an area of 10 ha in the eastern part of the aquifer is 3 km from the bagherkhan village where the disposal of solid wastes is carried out from urban and rural areas landfill in this study the porosity is one of the values obtained after calibrating the model as can be seen in fig 2 the range of porosity changes in this study is 0 01 0 3 the transmissivity parameter zoning in the model was based on the hydraulic conductivity zoning since transmissivity coefficient studies were not carried out in the bojnourd aquifer the results of schulz research were used to estimate the initial longitudinal diffusion coefficient after calibrating the steady state model the values shown in fig 3 were obtained it has been shown in fig 3 the longitudinal dispersivity is between 11 4 and 52 m2 day after the calibration of the model and the ratio of horizontal transverse dispersivity to longitudinal dispersivity was considered 0 1 2 2 mathematical modeling electrical conductivity indicates the amount of total dissolved substitution in water the estimations of total dissolved solids tds content are based on electrical conductivity ec measurements in order to estimate the tds of water by using the electrical conductivity the following equation was used during the modeling process 1 t d s m g l e c d s m 640 where tds is total dissolved solids and ec is electrical conductivity al dahaan et al 2016 detay and carpenter 1997 in this research total dissolved solids tds data were used in the mt3dms model and the values for this parameter were obtained from electrical conductivity data to investigate the quality of water within the region bojnourd plain divided into two sections the agricultural area and the urban area as well as centralized pollution landfill in the eastern part and spot contamination due to the expansion of the city outside the geometric scope in the western region classification of regional contamination disposal can be seen in fig 4 a in this research to prepare the model for bojnourd aquifer plain total dissolved solids tds has been used as a pollutant in the preparation of the qualitative model for this condition it is assumed that the groundwater advection movement does not occur and the transmission of contamination will be further through the dispersion and diffusion mechanisms evidently when underground water motions interfere in transferring the contamination the primary mechanism in pollutant movement is influenced by the combination of advection and dispersion processes the governing equation for the contamination transfer under the advection and dispersion mechanisms can be written as equation 1 by considering the following assumptions 1 non homogenous environment 2 non uniformity of environment 3 saturated environment according to darcy s law and considering the mass balance the following equation can be obtained on a characteristic volume in a three dimensional environment ljungberg and qvist 2004 2 c t x d x c x y d y c y z d z c z x v x c y v y c z v z c where v i is average linear velocity along i direction c is the contamination concentration in g m 3 d is contamination dispersion coefficient in m 2 s and t is a time in s this equation is a mass transfer equation for a conservative solution that does not react with the environment and does not classify as biodegradable or radioactive solutions in this research the mt3dms mathematical model has been used to solve the mentioned partial differential equation 2 2 1 meshing the region in general for the qualitative models the first step is designing the quantitative model and validated flow transport model therefore the meshing of the region is performed on the plain in most cases the same mesh is used for solving the qualitative models accordingly a meshing process was applied on the bojnourd aquifer for solving quantitative model and the size of each cell was chosen to be 250m 250m fig 4 c shows a map of the mesh applied on bojnourd plain 2 2 2 boundary conditions solving partial differential equations for pollutant mass transfer in the groundwater by using numerical methods requires the determination of boundary conditions in this research the aquifer physical boundary conditions are determined according to the conceptual model information the south and the southeastern part of the aquifer have constant head boundary due to the presence of surface water in these parts the surface and underground flows information and their impact on the aquifer were insufficient in the north the boundary was considered from the north to nearly west of the plain the concentrations of total dissolved solids were implemented in the transport model where the boundaries are a constant head fig 4 b represents the map with indicated inlet and outlet applied for solving the mass transfer equation numerically 2 2 3 initial conditions the initial conditions in quantitative and qualitative models are essential to simulate the concentration of a pollutant in the aquifer in a transient state in the simulation of small aquifers the initial conditions in the transient state have resulted from the findings obtained from the simulation in a steady state in fact in the qualitative models determining the initial conditions depends on the purposes of the modeling the ideal situation is that the measured water quality data can be obtained at different points and times in this research the electrical conductivity data in the sampling wells are available for the years 2008 2013 the data for 2012 is considered as the start time for beginning the calculations to estimate the pollutant concentration at different times 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation of model in this study 11 wells were selected as concentration monitoring wells and electrical conductivity ec was measured every six months and converted it to the total dissolved solids tds were introduced into the model electrical conductivity values in qualitative sampling wells are available for years 2008 2013 the march 2008 data is considered as the initial time of the calculations to calculate the concentration value at subsequent times by having the concentration in the observation wells and using the inverse distance weighting idw the concentration value was obtained in all parts of the aquifer in order to validate the model based on the bojnourd plain for 2012 to march 2013 assuming that the changes within the system were like the previous year various values for total dissolved solids tds were introduced into the model fig 5 presents the concentrations versus time calculated by the model for calibration and validation periods for wells no 7 8 and 10 it is concluded from the results in fig 5 that the accuracy of the final results in the verification is less than the final results in the calibration phase still in general as it can be seen the data in the calibration and verification step are between the allowed ranges of variations hence the result has shown the model has acceptable accuracy 3 2 prediction of water quality according to the modeling applied in this research in order to assess the condition of groundwater quality in the bojnourd plain within the upcoming years up to 2026 the simulation was carried out by considering the current plain conditions furthermore since the bojnourd municipal wastewater network is in operation and its utilization is expanding in the whole urban area another scenario has been implemented under the conditions of removal of wastewater effluent for the period mentioned above and its results have been presented as follows 3 2 1 scenario 1 modeling with the same basic conditions until 2026 assuming that the conditions of the region remain constant this model was implemented for the next 15 years until 2026 and the model results are presented in fig 6 as it is evident in the figures if the basin conditions are similar the concentration of total dissolved solid tds in this region increases fig 6 a and b illustrates the plume movement its transport from the west to east of the aquifer in the direction of groundwater movement due to lack of sewage collection system in the west area the quality of groundwater decrease in this section 3 2 2 scenario 2 modeling with the assumption of wastewater treatment implementation until 2026 in this scenario the system of sewage treatment was assumed to be implemented in the whole region and the results of the model were implemented until 2026 the results are presented in fig 7 a and b for the years of 2021 and 2026 respectively as it has been shown in fig 7 a and b the implementation of wastewater treatment as well as sewage networks is very effective for improving the groundwater quality located in this plain implementation of an urban sewage network leads to a significant reduction in the dispersion and dissolution of solid soluble materials in groundwater aquifers although the implementation of an urban sewage network decreases the tds of groundwater and improves water quality as a result obtained of modeling outcome according to the results obtained in this section the landfill would be one of the most important sources of pollution in this area fig 8 a represents the results obtained from the modeling for water quality of different wells located in various places of the region with and without the implementation of wastewater treatment in the year 2021 according to these results it is evident that for the condition that no sewage network is used around 45 of wells have total dissolved solids tds between 900 and 1400 ppm it indicates lower water quality distribution through the groundwater aquifer in bojnourd plain in addition it has resulted from this figure that about 10 of wells have total dissolved solids ranging from 2500 to 3900 ppm showing the pollution distributed in water aquifer however the results of this figure indicate that for the condition where sewage network is used about 90 of wells have total dissolved solids ranging from 0 to 900 ppm and only 10 of wells which is attributed to the landfill region have total dissolved solids ranging from 1800 to 2500 ppm fig 8 b represents the findings resulted from the modeling for water quality of different wells located in various places of the region with and without the implementation of wastewater treatment in the year 2026 according to these findings it is also concluded that for the condition that no sewage network is used around 65 of wells have total dissolved solids tds ranging from 900 to 1400 ppm representing lower water quality distribution through the groundwater aquifer moreover it is evident from this figure that about 10 of wells have total dissolved solids ranging from 2500 to 3900 ppm and also 10 of them have total dissolved solids ranging from 1800 to 2500 ppm indicating a high risk of pollution distributed within the groundwater ahead of the year on the contrary the findings of this figure declare that for the condition where sewage network is used about 90 of wells have total dissolved solids ranging from 0 to 900 ppm and only 10 of wells which is attributed to the landfill region have total dissolved solids ranging from 1800 to 2500 ppm this shows that by applying sewage network within the region no significant change is observed ahead of years although for the condition that no wastewater treatment is used the water quality decreases significantly in upcoming years the number of wells that have total dissolved solids range of 900 1400 ppm increases from 45 to 65 for 3 3 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis indicates the sensitivity of the model to different parameters that significantly affect the results during applying the sensitivity analysis the calibrated values of the longitudinal diffusion coefficient porosity and total dissolved solid recharge tds are changed systematically the amount of total dissolved solids in reality compared with the value of this parameter after calibration represents the sensitivity criterion of the model for total dissolved solids recharge tds thus the factors in which model respond is more significant and sensitive to their variations can be chosen as the essential parameters the parameters that the model is more sensitive to are more critical due to modified these influential parameters the model makes a considerable change and minimize the errors in order to identify the sensitivity of different aquifer parts by changing the input factors such as longitudinal diffusion coefficient porosity and total dissolved solid recharge tds the values of tds in the aquifer that was calculated by using the model was compared with the observed values and the values of root mean square error rmse were calculated the variation of input factors was chosen to be 10 20 and 30 vacant space in the soil called porosity or void which is a fraction of deduction of void and total volume is evaluated the amount of porosity is between 0 and 1 or as a percentage between 0 and 100 groundwater moving at rates more and less than the average linear velocity due to the mechanical dispersion the fluid does not move at the identical velocity everywhere and mixing happens along flow paths the mixing due to the direction of flow is named longitudinal dispersion on the other hand fluid diffusing normal to the orientation of flow from splitting and branching out to the sides is named transverse dispersivity in the following the sensitivity of the model to porosity and a void fraction has been studied 3 3 1 the sensitivity of the model to porosity parameter in this part of the research the sensitivity of the model was assessed based on the changes in the porosity used in the model for this purpose the sensitivity of the model was calculated by 10 20 and 30 change in porosity from its initial value to further check the robustness of the proposed model error analyses are carried out the values of rmse root mean square of errors that model gave for different conditions are shown in table 1 rmse is given by 3 r m s e 1 n i 1 n u a n u e n 2 where u a is the predicted porosity by the analytical model u e is the measured data from and n is the number of data the results of sensitivity analysis are presented in table 1 in which the values of rmse were obtained at different values of porosity as it is evident from the results in this table a 30 increase in porosity results in an almost 5 change in rmse in addition for 30 declination in this parameter only a 12 29 change in rmse was observed these results declare that the model is not more sensitive to the porosity and the change in this parameter does not affect the deviation of calculated data from the experimental values tangibly 3 3 2 the sensitivity of the model to the longitudinal diffusion coefficient in this part of the research the sensitivity of the model was calculated by 10 20 and 30 change in the longitudinal diffusion coefficient from its initial value the results of sensitivity analysis are shown in table 2 in which the values of rmse were calculated at different values of the longitudinal diffusion coefficient it is observed from the results of this table that with a 30 increment in longitudinal diffusion coefficient around 4 change in rmse is observed in addition for a 30 decrease in this parameter only a 6 77 change in rmse is identified these findings also declare that the model is not more sensitive to the longitudinal diffusion coefficient and the change in this parameter does not affect the deviation of calculated data from the experimental values tangibly 3 3 3 the sensitivity of the model to the total dissolved solid recharge the sensitivity of model was calculated by 10 20 and 30 change in total dissolved solid recharge from its initial value and the results of sensitivity analysis are shown in table 3 in which the values of rmse were calculated at different values of total dissolved solid recharge it is observed from the results of this table that with a 30 increase in total dissolved solid recharge around 38 8 change in rmse is observed furthermore a 30 decrease in this parameter results in a 48 4 variation in rmse these findings declare that the model is highly sensitive to total dissolved solid recharge and the change in this parameter affects the deviation of calculated data from the experimental values tangibly 4 conclusion in this research the hydrologic hydrochemistry and measured water quality model for the basin of the bojnourd plain were studied groundwater flow and contaminant fate and flow modeling are useful mechanisms for distinguishing aquifer parameters like porosity longitudinal dispersivity and determining pollution plume in aquifers to create the conceptual model and quality modeling of bojnourd plain geological data observation wells ec and tds concentration longitudinal dispersivity porosity and other information have been applied to gms and mt3dms the outcomes present valid results of observation and simulated values in more detail the findings show that since the concentration of dissolved solids was limited and dispersion of wells and time intervals were not proper the zoning of concentration of electrical conductivity is not very accurate also according to the zoning map of the underground water quality two existing wells in the east in the output area of the aquifer and southwest area of the aquifer with high concentrations data represent inappropriate investigation for the underground water electrical conductivity concentrations in this region as previously mentioned well number 5 located at the discharging area of the aquifer in the east has been influenced by the solids waste discharge near to this well landfill which has a leakage also groundwater quality declined in the west well number 2 due to the expansion of the urban area to the west the existence of these two wells has a great impact on the aquifer s total electrical conductivity concentrations in the model can be seen the concentration of total dissolved solids in the groundwater in the east increased because of the landfill located there and discharged effluent into absorbing wells in the urban area according to the sensitivity analysis the model is susceptible to changing the dissolved solids in the groundwater in this research the precise data for this parameter was not available as a result the model is not very accurate periodically measuring the amount of tds and the distribution of this parameter will increase the precision of the simulating model simulation of the first scenario shows that if this situation continues the concentration of tds in groundwater considerably increased and the quality of the groundwater in this aquifer wasted the second scenario shows the quality of the aquifer for the next 15 years where the municipal sewage system implement under the city the tds concentration in the aquifer reduces significantly and the quality of underground water in this plain improved this research shows that discharging the municipal sewage to absorbing wells impacts groundwater quality and increases groundwater pollution and implementing the swage system under the urban area boosts the groundwater quality declaration of competing interest there is no conflict of interests appendix a

tds content are based on electrical conductivity ec measurements in order to estimate the tds of water by using the electrical conductivity the following equation was used during the modeling process 1 t d s m g l e c d s m 640 where tds is total dissolved solids and ec is electrical conductivity al dahaan et al 2016 detay and carpenter 1997 in this research total dissolved solids tds data were used in the mt3dms model and the values for this parameter were obtained from electrical conductivity data to investigate the quality of water within the region bojnourd plain divided into two sections the agricultural area and the urban area as well as centralized pollution landfill in the eastern part and spot contamination due to the expansion of the city outside the geometric scope in the western region classification of regional contamination disposal can be seen in fig 4 a in this research to prepare the model for bojnourd aquifer plain total dissolved solids tds has been used as a pollutant in the preparation of the qualitative model for this condition it is assumed that the groundwater advection movement does not occur and the transmission of contamination will be further through the dispersion and diffusion mechanisms evidently when underground water motions interfere in transferring the contamination the primary mechanism in pollutant movement is influenced by the combination of advection and dispersion processes the governing equation for the contamination transfer under the advection and dispersion mechanisms can be written as equation 1 by considering the following assumptions 1 non homogenous environment 2 non uniformity of environment 3 saturated environment according to darcy s law and considering the mass balance the following equation can be obtained on a characteristic volume in a three dimensional environment ljungberg and qvist 2004 2 c t x d x c x y d y c y z d z c z x v x c y v y c z v z c where v i is average linear velocity along i direction c is the contamination concentration in g m 3 d is contamination dispersion coefficient in m 2 s and t is a time in s this equation is a mass transfer equation for a conservative solution that does not react with the environment and does not classify as biodegradable or radioactive solutions in this research the mt3dms mathematical model has been used to solve the mentioned partial differential equation 2 2 1 meshing the region in general for the qualitative models the first step is designing the quantitative model and validated flow transport model therefore the meshing of the region is performed on the plain in most cases the same mesh is used for solving the qualitative models accordingly a meshing process was applied on the bojnourd aquifer for solving quantitative model and the size of each cell was chosen to be 250m 250m fig 4 c shows a map of the mesh applied on bojnourd plain 2 2 2 boundary conditions solving partial differential equations for pollutant mass transfer in the groundwater by using numerical methods requires the determination of boundary conditions in this research the aquifer physical boundary conditions are determined according to the conceptual model information the south and the southeastern part of the aquifer have constant head boundary due to the presence of surface water in these parts the surface and underground flows information and their impact on the aquifer were insufficient in the north the boundary was considered from the north to nearly west of the plain the concentrations of total dissolved solids were implemented in the transport model where the boundaries are a constant head fig 4 b represents the map with indicated inlet and outlet applied for solving the mass transfer equation numerically 2 2 3 initial conditions the initial conditions in quantitative and qualitative models are essential to simulate the concentration of a pollutant in the aquifer in a transient state in the simulation of small aquifers the initial conditions in the transient state have resulted from the findings obtained from the simulation in a steady state in fact in the qualitative models determining the initial conditions depends on the purposes of the modeling the ideal situation is that the measured water quality data can be obtained at different points and times in this research the electrical conductivity data in the sampling wells are available for the years 2008 2013 the data for 2012 is considered as the start time for beginning the calculations to estimate the pollutant concentration at different times 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation of model in this study 11 wells were selected as concentration monitoring wells and electrical conductivity ec was measured every six months and converted it to the total dissolved solids tds were introduced into the model electrical conductivity values in qualitative sampling wells are available for years 2008 2013 the march 2008 data is considered as the initial time of the calculations to calculate the concentration value at subsequent times by having the concentration in the observation wells and using the inverse distance weighting idw the concentration value was obtained in all parts of the aquifer in order to validate the model based on the bojnourd plain for 2012 to march 2013 assuming that the changes within the system were like the previous year various values for total dissolved solids tds were introduced into the model fig 5 presents the concentrations versus time calculated by the model for calibration and validation periods for wells no 7 8 and 10 it is concluded from the results in fig 5 that the accuracy of the final results in the verification is less than the final results in the calibration phase still in general as it can be seen the data in the calibration and verification step are between the allowed ranges of variations hence the result has shown the model has acceptable accuracy 3 2 prediction of water quality according to the modeling applied in this research in order to assess the condition of groundwater quality in the bojnourd plain within the upcoming years up to 2026 the simulation was carried out by considering the current plain conditions furthermore since the bojnourd municipal wastewater network is in operation and its utilization is expanding in the whole urban area another scenario has been implemented under the conditions of removal of wastewater effluent for the period mentioned above and its results have been presented as follows 3 2 1 scenario 1 modeling with the same basic conditions until 2026 assuming that the conditions of the region remain constant this model was implemented for the next 15 years until 2026 and the model results are presented in fig 6 as it is evident in the figures if the basin conditions are similar the concentration of total dissolved solid tds in this region increases fig 6 a and b illustrates the plume movement its transport from the west to east of the aquifer in the direction of groundwater movement due to lack of sewage collection system in the west area the quality of groundwater decrease in this section 3 2 2 scenario 2 modeling with the assumption of wastewater treatment implementation until 2026 in this scenario the system of sewage treatment was assumed to be implemented in the whole region and the results of the model were implemented until 2026 the results are presented in fig 7 a and b for the years of 2021 and 2026 respectively as it has been shown in fig 7 a and b the implementation of wastewater treatment as well as sewage networks is very effective for improving the groundwater quality located in this plain implementation of an urban sewage network leads to a significant reduction in the dispersion and dissolution of solid soluble materials in groundwater aquifers although the implementation of an urban sewage network decreases the tds of groundwater and improves water quality as a result obtained of modeling outcome according to the results obtained in this section the landfill would be one of the most important sources of pollution in this area fig 8 a represents the results obtained from the modeling for water quality of different wells located in various places of the region with and without the implementation of wastewater treatment in the year 2021 according to these results it is evident that for the condition that no sewage network is used around 45 of wells have total dissolved solids tds between 900 and 1400 ppm it indicates lower water quality distribution through the groundwater aquifer in bojnourd plain in addition it has resulted from this figure that about 10 of wells have total dissolved solids ranging from 2500 to 3900 ppm showing the pollution distributed in water aquifer however the results of this figure indicate that for the condition where sewage network is used about 90 of wells have total dissolved solids ranging from 0 to 900 ppm and only 10 of wells which is attributed to the landfill region have total dissolved solids ranging from 1800 to 2500 ppm fig 8 b represents the findings resulted from the modeling for water quality of different wells located in various places of the region with and without the implementation of wastewater treatment in the year 2026 according to these findings it is also concluded that for the condition that no sewage network is used around 65 of wells have total dissolved solids tds ranging from 900 to 1400 ppm representing lower water quality distribution through the groundwater aquifer moreover it is evident from this figure that about 10 of wells have total dissolved solids ranging from 2500 to 3900 ppm and also 10 of them have total dissolved solids ranging from 1800 to 2500 ppm indicating a high risk of pollution distributed within the groundwater ahead of the year on the contrary the findings of this figure declare that for the condition where sewage network is used about 90 of wells have total dissolved solids ranging from 0 to 900 ppm and only 10 of wells which is attributed to the landfill region have total dissolved solids ranging from 1800 to 2500 ppm this shows that by applying sewage network within the region no significant change is observed ahead of years although for the condition that no wastewater treatment is used the water quality decreases significantly in upcoming years the number of wells that have total dissolved solids range of 900 1400 ppm increases from 45 to 65 for 3 3 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis indicates the sensitivity of the model to different parameters that significantly affect the results during applying the sensitivity analysis the calibrated values of the longitudinal diffusion coefficient porosity and total dissolved solid recharge tds are changed systematically the amount of total dissolved solids in reality compared with the value of this parameter after calibration represents the sensitivity criterion of the model for total dissolved solids recharge tds thus the factors in which model respond is more significant and sensitive to their variations can be chosen as the essential parameters the parameters that the model is more sensitive to are more critical due to modified these influential parameters the model makes a considerable change and minimize the errors in order to identify the sensitivity of different aquifer parts by changing the input factors such as longitudinal diffusion coefficient porosity and total dissolved solid recharge tds the values of tds in the aquifer that was calculated by using the model was compared with the observed values and the values of root mean square error rmse were calculated the variation of input factors was chosen to be 10 20 and 30 vacant space in the soil called porosity or void which is a fraction of deduction of void and total volume is evaluated the amount of porosity is between 0 and 1 or as a percentage between 0 and 100 groundwater moving at rates more and less than the average linear velocity due to the mechanical dispersion the fluid does not move at the identical velocity everywhere and mixing happens along flow paths the mixing due to the direction of flow is named longitudinal dispersion on the other hand fluid diffusing normal to the orientation of flow from splitting and branching out to the sides is named transverse dispersivity in the following the sensitivity of the model to porosity and a void fraction has been studied 3 3 1 the sensitivity of the model to porosity parameter in this part of the research the sensitivity of the model was assessed based on the changes in the porosity used in the model for this purpose the sensitivity of the model was calculated by 10 20 and 30 change in porosity from its initial value to further check the robustness of the proposed model error analyses are carried out the values of rmse root mean square of errors that model gave for different conditions are shown in table 1 rmse is given by 3 r m s e 1 n i 1 n u a n u e n 2 where u a is the predicted porosity by the analytical model u e is the measured data from and n is the number of data the results of sensitivity analysis are presented in table 1 in which the values of rmse were obtained at different values of porosity as it is evident from the results in this table a 30 increase in porosity results in an almost 5 change in rmse in addition for 30 declination in this parameter only a 12 29 change in rmse was observed these results declare that the model is not more sensitive to the porosity and the change in this parameter does not affect the deviation of calculated data from the experimental values tangibly 3 3 2 the sensitivity of the model to the longitudinal diffusion coefficient in this part of the research the sensitivity of the model was calculated by 10 20 and 30 change in the longitudinal diffusion coefficient from its initial value the results of sensitivity analysis are shown in table 2 in which the values of rmse were calculated at different values of the longitudinal diffusion coefficient it is observed from the results of this table that with a 30 increment in longitudinal diffusion coefficient around 4 change in rmse is observed in addition for a 30 decrease in this parameter only a 6 77 change in rmse is identified these findings also declare that the model is not more sensitive to the longitudinal diffusion coefficient and the change in this parameter does not affect the deviation of calculated data from the experimental values tangibly 3 3 3 the sensitivity of the model to the total dissolved solid recharge the sensitivity of model was calculated by 10 20 and 30 change in total dissolved solid recharge from its initial value and the results of sensitivity analysis are shown in table 3 in which the values of rmse were calculated at different values of total dissolved solid recharge it is observed from the results of this table that with a 30 increase in total dissolved solid recharge around 38 8 change in rmse is observed furthermore a 30 decrease in this parameter results in a 48 4 variation in rmse these findings declare that the model is highly sensitive to total dissolved solid recharge and the change in this parameter affects the deviation of calculated data from the experimental values tangibly 4 conclusion in this research the hydrologic hydrochemistry and measured water quality model for the basin of the bojnourd plain were studied groundwater flow and contaminant fate and flow modeling are useful mechanisms for distinguishing aquifer parameters like porosity longitudinal dispersivity and determining pollution plume in aquifers to create the conceptual model and quality modeling of bojnourd plain geological data observation wells ec and tds concentration longitudinal dispersivity porosity and other information have been applied to gms and mt3dms the outcomes present valid results of observation and simulated values in more detail the findings show that since the concentration of dissolved solids was limited and dispersion of wells and time intervals were not proper the zoning of concentration of electrical conductivity is not very accurate also according to the zoning map of the underground water quality two existing wells in the east in the output area of the aquifer and southwest area of the aquifer with high concentrations data represent inappropriate investigation for the underground water electrical conductivity concentrations in this region as previously mentioned well number 5 located at the discharging area of the aquifer in the east has been influenced by the solids waste discharge near to this well landfill which has a leakage also groundwater quality declined in the west well number 2 due to the expansion of the urban area to the west the existence of these two wells has a great impact on the aquifer s total electrical conductivity concentrations in the model can be seen the concentration of total dissolved solids in the groundwater in the east increased because of the landfill located there and discharged effluent into absorbing wells in the urban area according to the sensitivity analysis the model is susceptible to changing the dissolved solids in the groundwater in this research the precise data for this parameter was not available as a result the model is not very accurate periodically measuring the amount of tds and the distribution of this parameter will increase the precision of the simulating model simulation of the first scenario shows that if this situation continues the concentration of tds in groundwater considerably increased and the quality of the groundwater in this aquifer wasted the second scenario shows the quality of the aquifer for the next 15 years where the municipal sewage system implement under the city the tds concentration in the aquifer reduces significantly and the quality of underground water in this plain improved this research shows that discharging the municipal sewage to absorbing wells impacts groundwater quality and increases groundwater pollution and implementing the swage system under the urban area boosts the groundwater quality declaration of competing interest there is no conflict of interests appendix a

beings and other animals singh et al 2011 nkpaa et al 2018 metal ion speciation plays an important role in bioavailability of metals and it is influenced by physicochemical parameters such as hardness primarily ca and or mg concentration alkalinity ph natural dissolved organic matter dom and redox potential markich et al 2001 these physicochemical parameters vary with season hence may result in variation of metal species and their bioavailability higher concentration of metals are found in free metal ion form as compared to other forms suggesting that most of metals ion are readily available for uptake by plants and animals when groundwater is utilized for domestic and agriculture uses adekunle et al 2020 river floodplains are key reservoir of groundwater and play an important role in groundwater recharge floodplains in urban areas are degrading rapidly due to urban sprawl and agricultural practices in their vicinity singh et al 2005 nouri et al 2008 degradation of river floodplain is linked to deterioration of groundwater quality as alluvial unconfined aquifer in river floodplain has shallow depth of water table with high permeability hence are highly susceptible to

contamination anthropogenic or geogenic pollution indices such as contamination factor cf degree of contamination cd pollution load index pli and index of geo accumulation igeo were calculated to compute levels of metal contamination ecological risk index eri was computed to assess risk to biological species due to trace metal contaminated groundwater cf compare concentration of contaminant in environment to its background concentration it is used to determine extent by which concentration of contaminant exceeded in the environment in urban cities various anthropogenic activities lead to the contamination of groundwater and it becomes difficult to find less contaminated background source of groundwater having similar hydrological setting and water chemistry bhutiani et al 2017 previous study suggested that either geometric mean or median of sampled data can be used as background value bhutiani et al 2017 hence in this study geometric mean of the sampled data was used to calculate the cf to ascertain contamination due to all metals at particular sampling location cd is calculated cd is the sum of contamination factors pli gives complete information about the metal contamination and is calculated as square root of contamination factors tomlinson et al 1980 bhutiani et al 2017 eri is computed to quantify the risk due to toxic effects of trace metals on biological

the supplementary information table s1 2 6 health risk assessment 2 6 1 non carcinogenic risk exposure pathways are routes by which contaminants enter into human body and are key part of health risk assessment the major exposure pathways for humans are oral intake inhalation and dermal contact in aquatic system contaminants enter into human body through consumption of water and dermal contact with it during swimming and bathing activities annual daily dose add is calculated separately for each exposure pathways hazard quotient which is defined as the ratio of add and reference dose was calculated for each exposure pathways usepa 2004 to calculate the reference dose for dermal pathway reference dose for ingestion was divided by giabs gastrointestinal absorption factor usdoe 2011 duggal et al 2017 the addition of hq for all exposure pathways is hazard index hi a unitless entity total potential non carcinogenic risk due to all exposure pathways is assessed based on the value of

sites and seasons results showed that variation in the concentration of pb mn fe and as at different sites are statistically significant p 0 05 whereas variation in the concentration of all other metals at different sites are not significant the variation in concentration of studied metals are not statistically significant except for as p 0 05 in different seasons variation in concentration of as and fe at both sites and seasons is statistically significant p 0 05 in comparison to other metals fe and as have geogenic as well as anthropogenic sources in groundwater release of these metals in groundwater may be affected by varying seasons and sites the general trend of metals zn cu cd and as concentration in groundwater follows order of winter summer monsoon buragohain et al 2009 also reported similar trend of having higher metal concentration in post monsoon seasons winter than pre monsoon or dry season i e summer in the north eastern part of india dhemaji district situated in the state of assam lower concentration in monsoon may be attributed to dilution effect or monsoonal flushing giri et al 2012 in the present study concentration of ni is found highest in summer season as compared to winter and monsoon a study by lu et al 2018 to assess the trace metal contamination in groundwater of urban area of china also found that ni concentration is high in dry season as compare to wet season the concentration of pb and cr is found higher in winter and monsoon season than in summer lu et al 2018 also reported similar trend for increasing concentration of pb in wet season as compared to dry season the concentration of fe and mn was found to be higher in monsoon and winter than summer higher concentration of fe and mn during pre monsoon season is due to flushing dissolution of lithogenic and non lithogenic materials by infiltering water rajmohan and elango 2005 nshimiyimana et al 2016 also reported higher concentration of fe and mn in rainy season previous studies have also reported higher concentration of fe and mn in groundwater along yamuna river and identified reductive dissolution of fe mn oxyhydroxides as key cause for their higher concentration lorenzen et al 2010 groeschke et al 2017 high concentration of fe in groundwater can be ascribed to corrosion effects of borehole materials in water and redox environment jeevanandam et al 2007 higher concentration of mn in groundwater is attributed to organic circulation by plants and leaves jeevanandam et al 2007 mn plays an important role in plant metabolism and it accumulates in plant parts leaves mn become available for solution in runoff and soil moisture from the plant parts that die or shed agricultural and domestic activities such as use of pesticides and fertilizers irrigation with wastewater urban runoff waste disposal etc also lead to higher concentration of fe and mn in groundwater wagh et al 2018 during rainy season urban runoff containing various metals are collected in the river floodplain the impounded water in the floodplain then ultimately infiltrates into groundwater hence during monsoon water that infiltrates into aquifer contain these metals in dissolved form and with time they are adsorbed or precipitated moreover during rainy seasons leaching is more pronounced than dry season leaching enhances dissolution of residual minerals at the ground surface and induces relatively high metal concentration in groundwater in rainy season chen and jiao 2008 datta et al 1996 stated that surface runoff water which collects in topographically low areas is identified as water type contributing to groundwater recharge instead of rainfall water geochemical properties of groundwater in any area are governed by various factors such as chemistry of water in recharge area different geochemical process such as oxidation reduction adsorption etc occurring in subsurface rock water interaction and anthropogenic activities singh et al 2005 jeevanandam et al 2007 srivastava and ramanathan 2008 the sources of these metals in groundwater are further discussed in section 3 3 the concentration of as varies from below detection limit to 176 3 μg l at all the sites and seasons its concentration exceeds the bureau of indian standards bis 2012 acceptable limit i e 10 μg l and world health organization who 2011 limit 10 μg l in 58 3 of groundwater samples the exceedance level is computed by dividing the metal concentration in sample by bis limit it signifies the degree by which metals concentration exceed their respective drinking water standard majolagbe et al 2017 if the value of exceedance level is greater than one then it signifies that metal exceeds its respective limit the exceedance level for as in samples is found to be highest in winter season 5 0 and lowest in monsoon 3 1 the concentration of ni exceeds the bis limit in 28 3 of groundwater samples and the level of exceedance varies as summer 1 0 monsoon 0 7 winter 0 7 cd and co are detected only in four groundwater samples and are below the bis and who limit for drinking water the concentration of cr cu and zn were found to be below the bis and who limit and detected only in 18 9 and 26 groundwater samples respectively 46 6 of groundwater samples were found to have violated the bis limit for lead and the exceedance level varies as winter 1 6 monsoon 1 3 summer 1 0 mn was found to have concentrations exceeding the bis limit in most of the samples 90 and exceedance level follows the order of monsoon 9 9 winter 9 2 summer 8 1 fe was found to have concentration exceeding the bis limit in 83 3 of groundwater samples and the exceedance level varies as monsoon 16 3 winter 12 3 summer 10 3 the results of present study are compared with other studies done elsewhere and tabulated in table s3a it is found that the results of present study are in agreement with the previous studies earlier studies have highlighted the high pollution in yamuna river in delhi table s3b supplementary information provides a list of studies focused on metal levels in yamuna in delhi 3 2 assessment of pollution level in the study area trace metal contamination in groundwater is assessed by calculating pli igeo and cd the results of pli and cd are summarized in fig 3 a and as supplementary information in table s5 seasonal average of igeo was calculated to assess the level of metal contamination in groundwater supplementary information about results is provided in table s4 the values of igeo indicate uncontamination level for ni and cu in the study area igeo of pb indicates uncontaminated to moderately contaminated and moderately contaminated at sites which are in proximity to high traffic areas results of igeo for cr shows heavy contamination at site where un lined drains carrying the industrial and domestic wastewater joins the yamuna river whereas at sites which are located in middle segment of yamuna river floodplain it shows uncontamination to moderate contamination and moderate contamination contamination due to as varies from uncontaminated to moderate to heavy contamination at sites located in middle segment of the yamuna river floodplain in delhi igeo of fe depicts the moderate contamination at one site and uncontaminated to moderate contamination at three sites these sites are located very close within 100 500 m to polluted yamuna river igeo of mn shows uncontamination to moderate contamination only at few locations zn shows uncontamination to moderate contamination at sites located in upstream of yamuna river and moderate contamination at sites located in middle segment the sites which are located in part of river floodplain which is highly urbanized receives drainage of domestic and industrial wastewater and in proximity to polluted river are contaminated due to trace metals as suggested by igeo cd is used to assess the degree of total metal contamination in groundwater the results revealed that there is a variation in degree of metal contamination at sampling sites as well as in different seasons in winter season there is low contamination at sites located in downstream of yamuna river considerable contamination at site located near to high traffic area and thermal power plants now closed very high contamination at sites close to highly urbanized areas and moderate contamination at rest of the sites in summer season samples exhibited low contamination to very high contamination in the study area in monsoon season considerable contamination was found at most of the sites located upstream to middle segment of river floodplain whereas moderate contamination and very high contamination was found only at site which is in proximity to river in all seasons low degree of contamination was observed at sites located downstream of river and high degree of metal contamination was found at sites at the middle segment of the river while other sites show moderate to considerable contamination in groundwater pli at all sites in three seasons range from no pollution to extremely high pollution the results are shown in fig 3a in winter season pli varies from no pollution to extremely heavy pollution due to trace metals in groundwater in summer season it varies from no pollution to extremely heavy pollution in monsoon season it varies from no pollution to heavy pollution in all seasons generally no pollution occurs at sites located upstream and downstream of river floodplain and moderate to extremely heavy pollution at sites located in middle segment of river floodplain average pli values at all locations implies moderate pollution in following seasonal variation as summer 1 9 winter 1 7 monsoon 1 6 3 3 correlation analysis source apportionment and cluster analysis to find out the possible sources of metal in groundwater correlation analysis pca and cluster analysis have been carried out correlation analysis has been carried out to identify the relationship between metal and between metal and physico chemical properties of water the results are illustrated in figs 4 and 5 correlations analysis helps to identify the pollution sources since strong correlation between metals indicate similar origin results shows that ni has moderate positive correlation with as and pb whereas it has positive low correlation with fe as is moderately correlated with ni cd toc pb and has low correlation with fe moderate correlation between as and toc signify the role of organic carbon in reductive dissolution of fe oxy hydroxides and the related desorption of as groeschke et al 2017 pb shows moderate positive correlation with ni and as whereas it has strong positive correlation with fe and low positive correlation with zn strong positive correlation between pb and fe indicate the anthropogenic sources of these metals as pb is less abundant in the earth s crust correlation analysis revealed that mn has positive moderate correlation with ph and low positive correlation with tds ec toc and salinity chromium has moderate positive correlation with ph and low negative correlation with tds and salinity ec has positive moderate correlation with pb and low positive correlation with mn and fe toc tds and salinity have positive low correlation with mn fe and pb ec is related to the ionic content of sample which is in turn linked to tds and salinity naseh et al 2018 correlation of ec with metals showed that these are involved in various physicochemical reactions such as oxidation reduction and ion exchange in the groundwater aquifer system srivastava and ramanathan 2008 to identify the sources of metal pollution in groundwater pca has been carried out the results are shown in table s6 as supplementary information and fig 6 three important factors or components were selected based on kaiser criterion i e factors with eigen values higher than 1 are selected as principal component pc pca results indicate that three principal components explained 70 4 of the total variation in data set the first principal component explains 37 8 of the total variance and has loadings of pb fe as ni and cd in groundwater samples sources of these metals can be geogenic and anthropogenic geogenic sources can be attributed to rock water interactions weathering of rock etc previous studies reported that infiltration of reducing sewage influence river water triggers the release of geogenic as through reductive dissolution of as rich iron hydroxides in the study area yamuna river delhi sprenger and lorenzen 2014 groeschke et al 2017 sources of mn can be attributed to agricultural practices fertilizers sewage and animal waste disposal ramesh and elango 2012 in groundwater source of pb is mainly anthropogenic as pb containing minerals are less soluble in water ravichandran and jayaprakash 2011 irrigation return flow automobiles repair shop agricultural and domestic activities electroplating and sewage run off are the sources of pb and ni jeevanandam et al 2007 bhutiani et al 2016 wagh et al 2018 anthropogenic sources of these metals in the study area are agrochemicals sewage discharge and industrial effluents through contaminated yamuna river hence the first principal component represents metals which have mixed source i e geogenic as well as anthropogenic sources second principal component explains 19 8 of total variance and has higher loading of cu and zn sources of cu and zn are attributed to industrial activities such as metallurgical process electroplating paint and fabric printing industries and agricultural activities such as use of liquid manure composted material and agrochemicals bhutiani et al 2016 sources of cu are waste dumps domestic waste water fuel combustion wood production and phosphate containing fertilizers wagh et al 2018 second component can thus be related to agricultural activity led groundwater pollution as study area is used for agricultural or residential purposes the third principal component explains 12 8 of total variance and has higher loading of cr sources of cr can be attributed to intrusive rock weathering traffic residential waste pigments paints pottery units electroplating paper printing tannery effluent bhutiani et al 2016 wagh et al 2018 chromium occurs naturally in rocks animals plants soil and in volcanic dust and gases it adheres strongly to soil particles hence have limited mobility from soil to groundwater alam et al 2012 cr concentration in groundwater has been found to be below the bis limit hence it may be traced to geogenic sources cluster analysis is used to define the set of data into two or more unknown groups by combining the internal variables it helps to predict the common properties shared by number of groups variables based on overall group memberships tariq et al 2008 in this study cluster analysis has been done to classify sampling sites based on the metal content the results are illustrated in fig 7 cluster analysis classified ten sites into five clusters based on metal contamination the first cluster includes the 1st 2nd 9th and 10th site the possible source of metals pollution at these sites may be agricultural and residential activities the second cluster has contained only 3rd site the possible source of metals here may be open lined drains and contaminated river water the third cluster classified the 4th 7th and 8th sites into one group the possible sources at these sites are contaminated river water and other activities such as agricultural activities vehicular emission etc the fourth and fifth cluster contained 5th and 6th site respectively the 5th site is more distant in dendrogram from all other sites and possible sources of metals are metal contaminated water vehicular pollution religious activities and commercial activities the 6th site is in between two coal fired thermal power plants both of them are closed now although the power plant is closed now but waste disposed from powerplant may act as source of metals fly ash from rajghat power plant ash pond has 3200 μg l of as and 5 5 and 1 9 tonnes year of as have been dispersed from rajghat and indraprastha power plant respectively to yamuna river dubey et al 2012 groeschke 2017 stated that losing stream conditions i e the river water entering into the groundwater prevail in the study area which indicates yamuna river water infiltrates into shallow floodplain aquifer infiltration of polluted river water vehicular pollution urban and agricultural activities are identified as major sources of trace metals in groundwater of river floodplain 3 4 spatial and seasonal variation in ecological risk eri assessed the ecological risk due to metals which could be toxic to biological species to appraise the risk of metal contaminated groundwater on biological species eri was calculated at each sampling sites and in all three seasons the results are provided as supplementary information in table s5 and fig 3a the seasonal and spatial variation in ecological risk is illustrated by fig 3b in winter season results indicate that there is low ecological risk at all sites except for the 3rd site which shows moderate ecological risk in summer season low ecological risk was found except at the 4th 5th and 8th site located in middle segment of river floodplain where ecological risk was found to be moderate in monsoon season groundwater at 3rd and 8th sites were found to pose moderate ecological risk to biological species and low ecological risk was found at rest of sampling sites average eri for three seasons is calculated for each site which revealed that groundwater at only 3rd located where river receives domestic and industrial wastewater and 5th proximity to residential area site pose moderate ecological risk among all the sites 3 5 seasonal variation in health risk to determine the non carcinogenic effects of metal contaminated groundwater dermal and oral hazard quotient were calculated and tabulated in table 1 hi is sum of hazard quotient it is assumed that hi value less than 1 indicates no adverse health effects hi value greater than one indicates that there are possibilities of adverse health effects nkpaa et al 2018 wagh et al 2018 the results suggest that non cancer risk due to ingestion of metals contaminated water is higher than the dermal contact as hq dermal has very less influence on hi value for all metals similar results are shown by previous studies nkpaa et al 2018 in all three seasons studied metals do not pose non carcinogenic risk except for as and mn non carcinogenic risk due to as was found to be high in all three seasons and it is highest in winter and lowest in monsoon season fig 8 a kashyap et al 2018 carried out health risk assessment due to metals in groundwater of northern india and reported that there is high non cancer risk to exposed population due to as non cancer risk due to mn was found to be high in monsoon season than summer and winter season the hi value for fe 1 3 exceeds the limit only at 5th site indicating moderate non carcinogenic risk the spatial variation in noncarcinogenic risk at study sites due to as and mn is illustrated in fig 8b among all the sampling sites in all seasons highest noncarcinogenic risk due to as is observed at 8th hi 28 5 site and no risk at 3rd and 10th sites highest non carcinogenic risk due to mn occur at 7th 6 8 site and no risk at 1st 7th and 3rd sites among all the sampling locations in all three seasons assessment of non carcinogenic risk revealed that as and mn are the two metals which poses high health risk while variations in risk due to as and mn is as follows winter summer monsoon and monsoon winter summer respectively to assess the cancer risk due to ingestion and dermal contact with metal contaminated water ilcr oral and ilcr dermal has been calculated respectively the results are presented in table 1 the value of ilcr total has been obtained by addition of ilcr oral and ilcr dermal which evaluate the cancer risk due to utilization of groundwater for both drinking and bathing purposes the ilcr assess the probability of occurrence of cancer in the population due to intake of said carcinogenic element the acceptable ilcr values ranges between 10 4 and 10 6 nkpaa et al 2018 cancer risk was calculated only for ni cr pb as and cd seasonal and spatial variation in cancer risk due to selected metals has been illustrated in fig 9 a and b respectively pb and cr pose no cancer risk to exposed population while as pose potentially high cancer risk which is highest in winter and lowest in monsoon kashyap et al 2018 carried out health risk assessment due to metals in groundwater of northern india and reported that as is posing high cancer risk to adult 1 9 10 2 and child 1 6 10 2 population cancer risk due to ni is moderate whereas cd shows low risk to population who use the metal contaminated groundwater 4 conclusion the groundwater in the yamuna river floodplain delhi is found to be contaminated to a varying degree and has seasonal variation in level of trace metal contamination the concentration of ni as pb mn and fe exceed bis limit in 28 58 46 90 and 83 of groundwater samples respectively while the concentration of cr cd cu and zn are found below bis limit correlation analysis pca and cluster analysis identifies metal contaminated river water vehicular pollution agricultural and urban activities are major sources of metals in the study area the concentration of zn cu cd and as is low in monsoon season while pb and cr has higher concentration in winter and monsoon than in summer igeo revealed that groundwater is uncontaminated due to ni cd co and cu uncontaminated to moderately contaminated due to fe mn pb and zn and uncontaminated to heavily contaminated due to cr and as cd and pli as pollution assessment tools imply that groundwater is moderate to heavily polluted due to trace metals following seasonal trend of summer winter monsoon eri is calculated to assess the risk to biological species it is found highest in winter while lowest in summer season as and mn possess high non cancer health risk while variations in risk due to them follows winter summer monsoon and monsoon winter summer respectively cancer risk due to as is potentially high among all metals highest in winter and lowest in monsoon season this study clearly indicates that the groundwater quality of urban river floodplain is degraded contaminated due to as mn ni fe and pb and not safe for human consumption hence it is prerequisite to remediate the metals from groundwater before use this study further suggests that there is an urgent need for monitoring of groundwater quality in an urban river floodplain as they are more susceptible to contamination further developmental activities in river floodplain should be restricted to minimize their impacts on groundwater quality proactive control and rehabilitation actions should be taken to eliminate trace metals associated groundwater contamination declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interests

12086,increasing migration to developing urban areas has resulted in human settlements at low lying urban river floodplain groundwater is the primary source of drinking water as well as a key exposure pathway in the poor and marginalized people living near the floodplain this study investigates seasonal variation in metal pollution associated health and ecological risk due to exposure to contaminated groundwater of yamuna river floodplain in delhi trace metal pollution was found to be highest and lowest in summer and winter respectively polluted river water vehicular emissions agricultural and urban activities were identified as major sources of metals in groundwater metal contaminated groundwater was found to pose low to moderate ecological risk arsenic was found to pose cancer and non cancer risk the risk varied with seasons as winter summer monsoon high non cancer risk was computed for mn having seasonal trend of monsoon winter summer this study infers an urgent need for groundwater quality monitoring in urban river floodplain as it is prone to contamination due to its high permeability and over exploitation graphical abstract image 1 keywords cancer risk ecological risk non cancer risk trace metals pollution load index urban river floodplain 1 introduction groundwater is assumed as a safe source for drinking water without any treatment in many developing countries giri et al 2012 besides drinking it is used for various other purposes such as domestic agricultural and industrial duggal et al 2017 rapid unplanned urbanization and industrialization have led to deterioration of groundwater quality bhutiani et al 2017 anthropogenic activities like agricultural practices heavy withdrawal of groundwater mining disposal of municipal and industrial waste are accounted for contamination of groundwater nouri et al 2008 bhutiani et al 2016 kashyap et al 2018 natural geogenic phenomenon such as rock weathering rock water interaction ore formation also results in groundwater contamination but rate of contamination due to natural phenomenon is reported to be low as compared to anthropogenic activities jeevanandam et al 2007 ramesh and elango 2012 nshimiyimana et al 2016 duggal et al 2017 india has 2 2 of the global land and 4 of the world water resources to sustain the 16 of the world s population ramesh and elango 2012 groundwater quality needs attention because it is the only source of drinking water for approximately one third of the world s population ramesh and elango 2012 trace metal contamination in groundwater is widely studied by various researchers across the globe because of their toxicity bioaccumulation and persistence wongsasuluk et al 2014 hofmann et al 2015 bhutiani et al 2017 kashyap et al 2018 besides affecting the aquatic system trace metals impact human health through consumption and dermal contact with contaminated water bhutiani et al 2016 nkpaa et al 2018 metals like pb cr cd and as have no known role in living systems and are toxic even in trace amounts they are known to cause various health impacts such as several types of cancers respiratory diseases gastrointestinal disorders and skin allergies he et al 2005 bhutiani et al 2016 metals like zn fe mn cu and co are essential for human beings but exposure to high levels can lead to various health ailments singh et al 2011 rajappa et al 2010 bhutiani et al 2016 metals readily accumulate in important organs and glands such as heart brain kidney bone liver etc and then disrupt their metabolic functions singh et al 2011 bhutiani et al 2017 metals are also capable of hampering the biological function of nutritional minerals by replacing them singh et al 2011 chronic intake of metals has damaging effects on human beings and other animals singh et al 2011 nkpaa et al 2018 metal ion speciation plays an important role in bioavailability of metals and it is influenced by physicochemical parameters such as hardness primarily ca and or mg concentration alkalinity ph natural dissolved organic matter dom and redox potential markich et al 2001 these physicochemical parameters vary with season hence may result in variation of metal species and their bioavailability higher concentration of metals are found in free metal ion form as compared to other forms suggesting that most of metals ion are readily available for uptake by plants and animals when groundwater is utilized for domestic and agriculture uses adekunle et al 2020 river floodplains are key reservoir of groundwater and play an important role in groundwater recharge floodplains in urban areas are degrading rapidly due to urban sprawl and agricultural practices in their vicinity singh et al 2005 nouri et al 2008 degradation of river floodplain is linked to deterioration of groundwater quality as alluvial unconfined aquifer in river floodplain has shallow depth of water table with high permeability hence are highly susceptible to contamination singh et al 2005 nouri et al 2008 delhi is one of the dense megacities of india spreading in 1483 km2 of area around 97 of the population resides in urban areas economic survey of delhi 2017 18 delhi also has the highest population growth rate 7 5 which may be due to higher rate of migration of people from neighboring states as well as other parts of india economic survey of delhi 2017 18 migration of people increased from 0 5 lakh in 2002 to 1 3 lakh in 2017 economic survey of delhi 2017 18 rapid urbanization and increased migration have resulted in over exploitation of natural resources hence causing degradation of natural environment the yamuna river is the lifeline of delhi city and its floodplain has high potential for groundwater recharge the floodplain of yamuna river in delhi is used for agricultural residential purposes construction such as sports complex housing tourism bridges and highways economic survey of delhi 2017 18 mostly agricultural laborers and low income families live in the vicinity of floodplain and use groundwater for various purposes including drinking it is necessary to assess the impact of urban activities on groundwater quality of yamuna river floodplain particularly with reference to trace metals and the associated ecological and human health risk there are studies focused on contamination of metals and other ions in groundwater of delhi region other studies have assessed the potential of yamuna river floodplain for groundwater recharge kumar et al 2019 srivastava and ramanathan 2008 chatterjee et al 2009 alam et al 2012 sprenger and lorenzen 2014 lorenzen et al 2010 groeschke et al 2017 however studies related to seasonal variation in metal contamination and associated ecological and health risk due to groundwater in yamuna river floodplain in delhi are rare hence this study is designed to determine metal pollution in groundwater from inhabited floodplain the objectives of this study are 1 to find out seasonal variation in trace metal concentration in groundwater 2 to assess metal pollution by using various pollution assessment tools 3 to identify potential pollution sources 4 to carry out ecological and health risk assessment due to metal contaminated groundwater 2 material and methodology 2 1 study area delhi capital of india is situated at latitude 28 36ˊ n and longitude 77 12ˊ e having an elevation of 216 m above sea level climate of delhi is semi arid type and has three distinct seasons namely summer monsoon and winter delhi has two prominent geological features the aravalli ridge and the yamuna river the yamuna river enters delhi at palla north and after traveling 48 km in delhi it exits from jaitpur south ngt 2012 the total floodplain area of the river is 124 km2 in delhi out of which 59 km2 is lying on western bank and 65 km2 is lying on eastern bank the total area of river channel in delhi is 14 km2 ngt 2012 2 1 1 geology of the study area geologically delhi region is defined as indo gangetic alluvial plains transected by quartzite rocky ridge of proterozoic age which is an extension of aravalli hills srivastava and ramanathan 2008 the basement rock in foremost parts of delhi is quartzite rock but it is exposed as ridge from southern border of delhi to north on the west bank of yamuna river acting as prominent recharge zone for groundwater yamuna river floodplains in delhi are alluvial deposits comprising of sand kankar clay silt massive and weathered quartzite the bedrock is quartzite followed by older alluvium which is composed of clay and kankar formations the older alluvium varies between 30 and 115 m in depth having discharge and transmissivity of 18 135 m3 h and 130 403 m2 day respectively chatterjee et al 2009 the younger alluvium varies between 40 and 50 m in depth and overlies the older alluvium the younger alluvium is comprised of fine to medium grained sand with intervening silt and clay layer younger alluvium aquifer is of unconfined type and depth of water level in them varies between 2 5 and 7 m below ground level the ranges of discharge and transmissivity of younger alluvium are 150 300 m3 h and 730 2100 m2 day respectively chatterjee et al 2009 the aquifer in the active floodplain of yamuna river spread in the area of 97 km2 and is about 35 km long the aquifer system of yamuna floodplain has high potential to sustain high yielding wells to augment the water demand of delhi a well field area in palla region has been developed chatterjee et al 2009 2 1 2 description of sampling sites sampling sites for the study are located on yamuna river floodplain in delhi and are shown in fig 1 ten sites were chosen across the entire length 48 km of yamuna floodplain in delhi sampling sites were chosen based on different land uses along the river agriculture is the dominant activity at the first hiranki second shyamghat and tenth site madanpur khadar the third majnu ka teela fourth usmanpur and fifth site geeta colony flyover are close to heavy traffic residential and commercial areas the seventh barapulla upstream and eighth barapulla downstream sites are close to heavy traffic and residential area groundwater is used for the irrigation drinking and other domestic activities by the people residing near to yamuna river floodplain 2 2 sample collection and analysis a total of 60 groundwater samples were collected either from tube well or handpumps located in yamuna river floodplain in delhi sampling was carried out twice in each season i e winter january and february summer may and june

was done by toc analyzer shimadzu a 45 ml portion of water sample was mixed with 5 ml of nitric acid and were digested using microwave acid digestion speedwave mws 3 berghof gmbh usepa 3015 a digests were cooled to room temperature filtered using nylon syringe filter 0 25 μm and transferred to polypropylene bottles and brought into 50 ml with de ionized water reaction vessels were pre washed with nitric acid to avoid contamination to examine analytical interferences reagent blanks were also digested analysis of pb cr total as total mn zn cu co cd and ni were carried out by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes agilent and fe was analyzed by an atomic absorption spectrometer aas thermoscientific m series 2 3 chemicals and standards the chemicals nitric acid hydrofluoric acid and phosphoric acid of acs ar grade were procured from central drug house p ltd cdh stock of standard solutions of fe and multi element were purchased from merck and agilent respectively stock solutions were diluted to prepare the calibrations standards of metals highly pure deionized water from milli q system millipore usa was used 2 4 analytical quality control the aas and icp oes were calibrated with set of five standards the calibration curve was linear linear least squares fit of data in the concentration ranges having linear regression coefficients r2 0 995 icp oes and aas were operated under optimized conditions samples were analyzed in duplicate relative standard deviations rsds of duplicate samples were found to be less than 5 the reagent blanks often have metal concentration below detection limits and blank correction was done whenever required the lower detection limits of instruments for as cd co cr cu mn ni pb zn and fe are 0 14 0 26 0 07 0 31

82 92 and 90 respectively 2 5 pollution and ecological risk assessment various pollution indices were calculated to assess the level of trace metal pollution by determining the level and source of contamination anthropogenic or geogenic pollution indices such as contamination factor cf degree of contamination cd pollution load index pli and index of geo accumulation igeo were calculated to compute levels of metal contamination ecological risk index eri was computed to assess risk to biological species due to trace metal contaminated groundwater cf compare concentration of contaminant in environment to its background concentration it is used to determine extent by which concentration of contaminant exceeded in the environment in urban cities various anthropogenic activities lead to the contamination of groundwater and it becomes difficult to find less contaminated background source of groundwater having similar hydrological setting and water chemistry bhutiani et al 2017 previous study suggested that either geometric mean or median of sampled data can be used as background value bhutiani et al 2017 hence in this study geometric mean of the sampled data was used to calculate the cf to ascertain contamination due to all metals at particular sampling location cd is calculated cd is the sum of contamination factors pli gives complete information about the metal contamination and is calculated as square root of contamination factors tomlinson et al 1980 bhutiani et al 2017 eri is computed to quantify the risk due to toxic effects of trace metals on biological species hakanson 1980 bhutiani et al 2017 it is estimated by calculating ecological risk er by multiplying the cf with toxic response factor tr the tr values for cr 2 cd 30 ni 5 zn 1 cu 5 mn 1 co 5 as 10 and pb 5 were adopted from hakanson 1980 and xu et al 2008 eri which represents total risk to biological species due to trace metal contaminated water is the sum of potential ecological risk factors the mathematical equations used to calculate the cf cd pli igeo and eri and their respective interpretation about the metal s contamination level in water and associated risk are described in the supplementary information table s1 2 6 health risk assessment 2 6 1 non carcinogenic risk exposure pathways are routes by which contaminants enter into human body and are key part of health risk assessment the major exposure pathways for humans are oral intake inhalation and dermal contact in aquatic system contaminants enter into human body through consumption of water and dermal contact with it during swimming and bathing activities annual daily dose add is calculated separately for each exposure pathways hazard quotient which is defined as the ratio of add and reference dose was calculated for each exposure pathways usepa 2004 to calculate the reference dose for dermal pathway reference dose for ingestion was divided by giabs gastrointestinal absorption factor usdoe 2011 duggal et al 2017 the addition of hq for all exposure pathways is hazard index hi a unitless entity total potential non carcinogenic risk due to all exposure pathways is assessed based on the value of hi it is generally assumed that there is potential non carcinogenic risk if hi value exceeds one and if hi value is below one then there is no potential non carcinogenic risk to the exposed population duggal et al 2017 theoretical equations and guidance set by usepa 2004 as followed by other studies nkpaa et al 2018 were used to calculate risk by using following equations equations 1 4 1 add ing c

represent the unit conversion factor 10 2 6 2 carcinogenic risk carcinogenic risk is defined as the incremental probability of an individual developing cancer due to exposure to pollutant nkpaa et al 2018 it is calculated by multiplying the add with cancer slope factor csf csf is different for each metal and also for exposure pathways 5 cr add x csf the input factors to calculate the non carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risk are described in supplementary information table s2 2 7 statistical analysis to determine the significant difference between the metal concentration in different seasons and at different sampling sites two way analysis of variance anova has been carried out to determine the relation between metals and between metals and physico chemical properties of groundwater ph ec tds salinity temp correlation coefficient was calculated contaminant source apportionment was done by using principal component analysis pca and cluster analysis varimax with kaiser normalization was used as rotation method in pca statistical analysis of data was done by using spss 20 0 interpolation map for ecological and health risk distribution in the study area was plotted by inverse distance weighted idw method using arcgis 10 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 seasonal and spatial variation in metal concentration seasonal and spatial variation in concentration of metals like as pb cd co mn zn cu cr ni and fe were assessed the results are presented in fig 2 two way anova at 95 significance level was carried out to assess statistically significant variation of metals at all sites and seasons results showed that variation in the concentration of pb mn fe and as at different sites are statistically significant p 0 05 whereas variation in the concentration of all other metals at different sites are not significant the variation in concentration of studied metals are not statistically significant except for as p 0 05 in different seasons variation in concentration of as and fe at both sites and seasons is statistically significant p 0 05 in comparison to other metals fe and as have geogenic as well as anthropogenic sources in groundwater release of these metals in groundwater may be affected by varying seasons and sites the general trend of metals zn cu cd and as concentration in groundwater follows order of winter summer monsoon buragohain et al 2009 also reported similar trend of having higher metal concentration in post monsoon seasons winter than pre monsoon or dry season i e summer in the north eastern part of india dhemaji district situated in the state of assam lower concentration in monsoon may be attributed to dilution effect or monsoonal flushing giri et al 2012 in the present study concentration of ni is found highest in summer season as compared to winter and monsoon a study by lu et al 2018 to assess the trace metal contamination in groundwater of urban area of china also found that ni concentration is high in dry season as compare to wet season the concentration of pb and cr is found higher in winter and monsoon season than in summer lu et al 2018 also reported similar trend for increasing concentration of pb in wet season as compared to dry season the concentration of fe and mn was found to be higher in monsoon and winter than summer higher concentration of fe and mn during pre monsoon season is due to flushing dissolution of lithogenic and non lithogenic materials by infiltering water rajmohan and elango 2005 nshimiyimana et al 2016 also reported higher concentration of fe and mn in rainy season previous studies have also reported higher concentration of fe and mn in groundwater along yamuna river and identified reductive dissolution of fe mn oxyhydroxides as key cause for their higher concentration lorenzen et al 2010 groeschke et al 2017 high concentration of fe in groundwater can be ascribed to corrosion effects of borehole materials in water and redox environment jeevanandam et al 2007 higher concentration of mn in groundwater is attributed to organic circulation by plants and leaves jeevanandam et al 2007 mn plays an important role in plant metabolism and it accumulates in plant parts leaves mn become available for solution in runoff and soil moisture from the plant parts that die or shed agricultural and domestic activities such as use of pesticides and fertilizers irrigation with wastewater urban runoff waste disposal etc also lead to higher concentration of fe and mn in groundwater wagh et al 2018 during rainy season urban runoff containing various metals are collected in the river floodplain the impounded water in the floodplain then ultimately infiltrates into groundwater hence during monsoon water that infiltrates into aquifer contain these metals in dissolved form and with time they are adsorbed or precipitated moreover during rainy seasons leaching is more pronounced than dry season leaching enhances dissolution of residual minerals at the ground surface and induces relatively high metal concentration in groundwater in rainy season chen and jiao 2008 datta et al 1996 stated that surface runoff water which collects in topographically low areas is identified as water type contributing to groundwater recharge instead of rainfall water geochemical properties of groundwater in any area are governed by various factors such as chemistry of water in recharge area different geochemical process such as oxidation reduction adsorption etc occurring in subsurface rock water interaction and anthropogenic activities singh et al 2005 jeevanandam et al 2007 srivastava and ramanathan 2008 the sources of these metals in groundwater are further discussed in section 3 3 the concentration of as varies from below detection limit to 176 3 μg l at all the sites and seasons its concentration exceeds the bureau of indian standards bis 2012 acceptable limit i e 10 μg l and world health organization who 2011 limit 10 μg l in 58 3 of groundwater samples the exceedance level is computed by dividing the metal concentration in sample by bis limit it signifies the degree by which metals concentration exceed their respective drinking water standard majolagbe et al 2017 if the value of exceedance level is greater than one then it signifies that metal exceeds its respective limit the exceedance level for as in samples is found to be highest in winter season 5 0 and lowest in monsoon 3 1 the concentration of ni exceeds the bis limit in 28 3 of groundwater samples and the level of exceedance varies as summer 1 0 monsoon 0 7 winter 0 7 cd and co are detected only in four groundwater samples and are below the bis and who limit for drinking water the concentration of cr cu and zn were found to be below the bis and who limit and detected only in 18 9 and 26 groundwater samples respectively 46 6 of groundwater samples were found to have violated the bis limit for lead and the exceedance level varies as winter 1 6 monsoon 1 3 summer 1 0 mn was found to have concentrations exceeding the bis limit in most of the samples 90 and exceedance level follows the order of monsoon 9 9 winter 9 2 summer 8 1 fe was found to have concentration exceeding the bis limit in 83 3 of groundwater samples and the exceedance level varies as monsoon 16 3 winter 12 3 summer 10 3 the results of present study are compared with other studies done elsewhere and tabulated in table s3a it is found that the results of present study are in agreement with the previous studies earlier studies have highlighted the high pollution in yamuna river in delhi table s3b supplementary information provides a list of studies focused on metal levels in yamuna in delhi 3 2 assessment of pollution level in the study area trace metal contamination in groundwater is assessed by calculating pli igeo and cd the results of pli and cd are summarized in fig 3 a and as supplementary information in table s5 seasonal average of igeo was calculated to assess the level of metal contamination in groundwater supplementary information about results is provided in table s4 the values of igeo indicate uncontamination level for ni and cu in the study area igeo of pb indicates uncontaminated to moderately contaminated and moderately contaminated at sites which are in proximity to high traffic areas results of igeo for cr shows heavy contamination at site where un lined drains carrying the industrial and domestic wastewater joins the yamuna river whereas at sites which are located in middle segment of yamuna river floodplain it shows uncontamination to moderate contamination and moderate contamination contamination due to as varies from uncontaminated to moderate to heavy contamination at sites located in middle segment of the yamuna river floodplain in delhi igeo of fe depicts the moderate contamination at one site and uncontaminated to moderate contamination at three sites these sites are located very close within 100 500 m to polluted yamuna river igeo of mn shows uncontamination to moderate contamination only at few locations zn shows uncontamination to moderate contamination at sites located in upstream of yamuna river and moderate contamination at sites located in middle segment the sites which are located in part of river floodplain which is highly urbanized receives drainage of domestic and industrial wastewater and in proximity to polluted river are contaminated due to trace metals as suggested by igeo cd is used to assess the degree of total metal contamination in groundwater the results revealed that there is a variation in degree of metal contamination at sampling sites as well as in different seasons in winter season there is low contamination at sites located in downstream of yamuna river considerable contamination at site located near to high traffic area and thermal power plants now closed very high contamination at sites close to highly urbanized areas and moderate contamination at rest of the sites in summer season samples exhibited low contamination to very high contamination in the study area in monsoon season considerable contamination was found at most of the sites located upstream to middle segment of river floodplain whereas moderate contamination and very high contamination was found only at site which is in proximity to river in all seasons low degree of contamination was observed at sites located downstream of river and high degree of metal contamination was found at sites at the middle segment of the river while other sites show moderate to considerable contamination in groundwater pli at all sites in three seasons range from no pollution to extremely high pollution the results are shown in fig 3a in winter season pli varies from no pollution to extremely heavy pollution due to trace metals in groundwater in summer season it varies from no pollution to extremely heavy pollution in monsoon season it varies from no pollution to heavy pollution in all seasons generally no pollution occurs at sites located upstream and downstream of river floodplain and moderate to extremely heavy pollution at sites located in middle segment of river floodplain average pli values at all locations implies moderate pollution in following seasonal variation as summer 1 9 winter 1 7 monsoon 1 6 3 3 correlation analysis source apportionment and cluster analysis to find out the possible sources of metal in groundwater correlation analysis pca and cluster analysis have been carried out correlation analysis has been carried out to identify the relationship between metal and between metal and physico chemical properties of water the results are illustrated in figs 4 and 5 correlations analysis helps to identify the pollution sources since strong correlation between metals indicate similar origin results shows that ni has moderate positive correlation with as and pb whereas it has positive low correlation with fe as is moderately correlated with ni cd toc pb and has low correlation with fe moderate correlation between as and toc signify the role of organic carbon in reductive dissolution of fe oxy hydroxides and the related desorption of as groeschke et al 2017 pb shows moderate positive correlation with ni and as whereas it has strong positive correlation with fe and low positive correlation with zn strong positive correlation between pb and fe indicate the anthropogenic sources of these metals as pb is less abundant in the earth s crust correlation analysis revealed that mn has positive moderate correlation with ph and low positive correlation with tds ec toc and salinity chromium has moderate positive correlation with ph and low negative correlation with tds and salinity ec has positive moderate correlation with pb and low positive correlation with mn and fe toc tds and salinity have positive low correlation with mn fe and pb ec is related to the ionic content of sample which is in turn linked to tds and salinity naseh et al 2018 correlation of ec with metals showed that these are involved in various physicochemical reactions such as oxidation reduction and ion exchange in the groundwater aquifer system srivastava and ramanathan 2008 to identify the sources of metal pollution in groundwater pca has been carried out the results are shown in table s6 as supplementary information and fig 6 three important factors or components were selected based on kaiser criterion i e factors with eigen values higher than 1 are selected as principal component pc pca results indicate that three principal components explained 70 4 of the total variation in data set the first principal component explains 37 8 of the total variance and has loadings of pb fe as ni and cd in groundwater samples sources of these metals can be geogenic and anthropogenic geogenic sources can be attributed to rock water interactions weathering of rock etc previous studies reported that infiltration of reducing sewage influence river water triggers the release of geogenic as through reductive dissolution of as rich iron hydroxides in the study area yamuna river delhi sprenger and lorenzen 2014 groeschke et al 2017 sources of mn can be attributed to agricultural practices fertilizers sewage and animal waste disposal ramesh and elango 2012 in groundwater source of pb is mainly anthropogenic as pb containing minerals are less soluble in water ravichandran and jayaprakash 2011 irrigation return flow automobiles repair shop agricultural and domestic activities electroplating and sewage run off are the sources of pb and ni jeevanandam et al 2007 bhutiani et al 2016 wagh et al 2018 anthropogenic sources of these metals in the study area are agrochemicals sewage discharge and industrial effluents through contaminated yamuna river hence the first principal component represents metals which have mixed source i e geogenic as well as anthropogenic sources second principal component explains 19 8 of total variance and has higher loading of cu and zn sources of cu and zn are attributed to industrial activities such as metallurgical process electroplating paint and fabric printing industries and agricultural activities such as use of liquid manure composted material and agrochemicals bhutiani et al 2016 sources of cu are waste dumps domestic waste water fuel combustion wood production and phosphate containing fertilizers wagh et al 2018 second component can thus be related to agricultural activity led groundwater pollution as study area is used for agricultural or residential purposes the third principal component explains 12 8 of total variance and has higher loading of cr sources of cr can be attributed to intrusive rock weathering traffic residential waste pigments paints pottery units electroplating paper printing tannery effluent bhutiani et al 2016 wagh et al 2018 chromium occurs naturally in rocks animals plants soil and in volcanic dust and gases it adheres strongly to soil particles hence have limited mobility from soil to groundwater alam et al 2012 cr concentration in groundwater has been found to be below the bis limit hence it may be traced to geogenic sources cluster analysis is used to define the set of data into two or more unknown groups by combining the internal variables it helps to predict the common properties shared by number of groups variables based on overall group memberships tariq et al 2008 in this study cluster analysis has been done to classify sampling sites based on the metal content the results are illustrated in fig 7 cluster analysis classified ten sites into five clusters based on metal contamination the first cluster includes the 1st 2nd 9th and 10th site the possible source of metals pollution at these sites may be agricultural and residential activities the second cluster has contained only 3rd site the possible source of metals here may be open lined drains and contaminated river water the third cluster classified the 4th 7th and 8th sites into one group the possible sources at these sites are contaminated river water and other activities such as agricultural activities vehicular emission etc the fourth and fifth cluster contained 5th and 6th site respectively the 5th site is more distant in dendrogram from all other sites and possible sources of metals are metal contaminated water vehicular pollution religious activities and commercial activities the 6th site is in between two coal fired thermal power plants both of them are closed now although the power plant is closed now but waste disposed from powerplant may act as source of metals fly ash from rajghat power plant ash pond has 3200 μg l of as and 5 5 and 1 9 tonnes year of as have been dispersed from rajghat and indraprastha power plant respectively to yamuna river dubey et al 2012 groeschke 2017 stated that losing stream conditions i e the river water entering into the groundwater prevail in the study area which indicates yamuna river water infiltrates into shallow floodplain aquifer infiltration of polluted river water vehicular pollution urban and agricultural activities are identified as major sources of trace metals in groundwater of river floodplain 3 4 spatial and seasonal variation in ecological risk eri assessed the ecological risk due to metals which could be toxic to biological species to appraise the risk of metal contaminated groundwater on biological species eri was calculated at each sampling sites and in all three seasons the results are provided as supplementary information in table s5 and fig 3a the seasonal and spatial variation in ecological risk is illustrated by fig 3b in winter season results indicate that there is low ecological risk at all sites except for the 3rd site which shows moderate ecological risk in summer season low ecological risk was found except at the 4th 5th and 8th site located in middle segment of river floodplain where ecological risk was found to be moderate in monsoon season groundwater at 3rd and 8th sites were found to pose moderate ecological risk to biological species and low ecological risk was found at rest of sampling sites average eri for three seasons is calculated for each site which revealed that groundwater at only 3rd located where river receives domestic and industrial wastewater and 5th proximity to residential area site pose moderate ecological risk among all the sites 3 5 seasonal variation in health risk to determine the non carcinogenic effects of metal contaminated groundwater dermal and oral hazard quotient were calculated and tabulated in table 1 hi is sum of hazard quotient it is assumed that hi value less than 1 indicates no adverse health effects hi value greater than one indicates that there are possibilities of adverse health effects nkpaa et al 2018 wagh et al 2018 the results suggest that non cancer risk due to ingestion of metals contaminated water is higher than the dermal contact as hq dermal has very less influence on hi value for all metals similar results are shown by previous studies nkpaa et al 2018 in all three seasons studied metals do not pose non carcinogenic risk except for as and mn non carcinogenic risk due to as was found to be high in all three seasons and it is highest in winter and lowest in monsoon season fig 8 a kashyap et al 2018 carried out health risk assessment due to metals in groundwater of northern india and reported that there is high non cancer risk to exposed population due to as non cancer risk due to mn was found to be high in monsoon season than summer and winter season the hi value for fe 1 3 exceeds the limit only at 5th site indicating moderate non carcinogenic risk the spatial variation in noncarcinogenic risk at study sites due to as and mn is illustrated in fig 8b among all the sampling sites in all seasons highest noncarcinogenic risk due to as is observed at 8th hi 28 5 site and no risk at 3rd and 10th sites highest non carcinogenic risk due to mn occur at 7th 6 8 site and no risk at 1st 7th and 3rd sites among all the sampling locations in all three seasons assessment of non carcinogenic risk revealed that as and mn are the two metals which poses high health risk while variations in risk due to as and mn is as follows winter summer monsoon and monsoon winter summer respectively to assess the cancer risk due to ingestion and dermal contact with metal contaminated water ilcr oral and ilcr dermal has been calculated respectively the results are presented in table 1 the value of ilcr total has been obtained by addition of ilcr oral and ilcr dermal which evaluate the cancer risk due to utilization of groundwater for both drinking and bathing purposes the ilcr assess the probability of occurrence of cancer in the population due to intake of said carcinogenic element the acceptable ilcr values ranges between 10 4 and 10 6 nkpaa et al 2018 cancer risk was calculated only for ni cr pb as and cd seasonal and spatial variation in cancer risk due to selected metals has been illustrated in fig 9 a and b respectively pb and cr pose no cancer risk to exposed population while as pose potentially high cancer risk which is highest in winter and lowest in monsoon kashyap et al 2018 carried out health risk assessment due to metals in groundwater of northern india and reported that as is posing high cancer risk to adult 1 9 10 2 and child 1 6 10 2 population cancer risk due to ni is moderate whereas cd shows low risk to population who use the metal contaminated groundwater 4 conclusion the groundwater in the yamuna river floodplain delhi is found to be contaminated to a varying degree and has seasonal variation in level of trace metal contamination the concentration of ni as pb mn and fe exceed bis limit in 28 58 46 90 and 83 of groundwater samples respectively while the concentration of cr cd cu and zn are found below bis limit correlation analysis pca and cluster analysis identifies metal contaminated river water vehicular pollution agricultural and urban activities are major sources of metals in the study area the concentration of zn cu cd and as is low in monsoon season while pb and cr has higher concentration in winter and monsoon than in summer igeo revealed that groundwater is uncontaminated due to ni cd co and cu uncontaminated to moderately contaminated due to fe mn pb and zn and uncontaminated to heavily contaminated due to cr and as cd and pli as pollution assessment tools imply that groundwater is moderate to heavily polluted due to trace metals following seasonal trend of summer winter monsoon eri is calculated to assess the risk to biological species it is found highest in winter while lowest in summer season as and mn possess high non cancer health risk while variations in risk due to them follows winter summer monsoon and monsoon winter summer respectively cancer risk due to as is potentially high among all metals highest in winter and lowest in monsoon season this study clearly indicates that the groundwater quality of urban river floodplain is degraded contaminated due to as mn ni fe and pb and not safe for human consumption hence it is prerequisite to remediate the metals from groundwater before use this study further suggests that there is an urgent need for monitoring of groundwater quality in an urban river floodplain as they are more susceptible to contamination further developmental activities in river floodplain should be restricted to minimize their impacts on groundwater quality proactive control and rehabilitation actions should be taken to eliminate trace metals associated groundwater contamination declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interests

12087,the sundarban biosphere reserve sbr of india lies in the southwestern part of the ganges brahmaputra delta the sbr traversed by tidal creeks and rivulets suffers perennially from the scarcity of freshwater in spite of heavy precipitation in monsoon months rivers in sundarbans are saline in nature with brackish groundwater in the subsurface fresh groundwater is mainly available from the confined aquifers and occurs at a depth range of 160 400 m below ground level the 4 43 million population in the sbr depend fully on deep groundwater to meet their drinking water demand it is therefore necessary to assess the quality of groundwater to fulfil the sustainable development goal the water quality index wqi has been estimated for shallow and deep aquifers based on water quality parameters like ph tds ec cl so4 hco3 th ca mg and na the dominant cations are found in the order na mg ca and dominant anions in the order hco3 cl so4 the groundwater in the sbr region belongs to nahco3 nacl and mixed type hydro geochemical facies the cl hco3 ratio indicates that the shallow aquifers are affected by the saline water intrusion following the limit set by the bureau of indian standards the shallow groundwater in the sbr is found to be unsuitable for drinking although the deep groundwater is within the permissible limit of safe drinking water its quality is poor the coastal regulation zone notification of 2011 has identified the sbr region as critically vulnerable coastal area and restricted the use of deep freshwater for drinking purpose only the paper argues that to meet the goal of sustainable development and safe drinking water for all in the future extensive rainwater harvesting and supply of treated surface water through pipeline and desalination of subsurface brackish water are some of the feasible options in the region graphical abstract image 1 keywords sundarbans groundwater quality coastal aquifer water quality index 1 introduction groundwater one of the major potable water sources in the world is under stress due to its limited supply and overexploitation at least half of the world s population use groundwater for drinking purpose unesco 2015 about one third of the global population depends on groundwater to meet their daily needs saana et al 2016 unesco 2012 the annual abstraction of groundwater in the world is estimated in an around 1000 km3 of which 22 is used for the domestic purpose eurostat 2011 fao 2011 globally around 2 1 billion people 3 in 10 approximately currently lack access to safe drinking water who 2017 among them the largest number over 163 million people live in india around 88 of the rural population in india depends on groundwater to meet their potable water need jain et al 2010 access to safe drinking water is also another problem in the country ibid availability of groundwater is decreasing rapidly with the increasing population whereas its quality is deteriorating mainly due to anthropogenic activities tyagi et al 2013 in the last few decades concern for groundwater quality has been increased many folds receiving as much importance as water quantity abbasi 2002 kaur et al 2014 according to who contaminated water is responsible for 80 of all the diseases in human beings kaur et al 2014 globally about 760 000 children aged less than 5 years die annually in diarrheal disease due to contaminated drinking water who 2014 improving the availability of safe drinking water is essential to reduce death safe drinking water is also required to improve the quality of life lawson 2011 saana et al 2016 the sundarbans biosphere reserve sbr india also facing acute scarcity of potable water though it is crisscrossed by numerous creeks and rivulets and receives a huge amount of precipitation during the monsoon months bhadra et al 2018 hazra et al 2019 the tidal rivers of sundarbans are saline in nature being disconnected from their parent rivers due to various natural and anthropogenic reasons bhadra et al 2017 and the shallow groundwater is not suitable for drinking bhadra et al 2018 gayen 2009 sinha roy 2010 2014 world bank 2014 therefore 4 43 million people of the sbr have to depend only on deep groundwater to meet their potable water demand almost 70 of the total population in the sbr has no access to safe drinking water world bank 2014 due to inadequate household water supply sanitation and hygiene around 1925 deaths and over 1 5 million cases of diarrhoea were reported in 2008 world bank 2014 in these circumstances it is highly essential to monitor groundwater chemistry for its sustainable management and to provide safe drinking water to all in future chidambaram et al 2018 subba rao et al 2012 a number of studies have been carried out to monitor groundwater quality by the researchers all over the world studies have also been accomplished on complex hydro geochemical processes in coastal aquifers as it is more vulnerable

singaraja et al 2015 surinaidu 2016 singh et al 2017 subba rao et al 2017 and chidambaram et al 2018 respectively very few studies have been done to assess the hydro geochemical characteristics of the coastal aquifers of west bengal especially in the sbr which are vulnerable due to overexploitation and interaction with saline river water at shallow level bhadra et al 2013 2018 hazra et al 2019 the previous studies are very non systematic and irregular it s not possible to get an overall idea about groundwater quality of the entire region from those studies and not also possible to assess the temporal change of groundwater quality from those studies in this circumstance the aim of the study is to prepare a baseline of groundwater quality in the entire indian sundarbans region as well to assess the potability of the water in the vulnerable delta it would be easier for future researchers to assess temporal change of groundwater quality based on the present baseline study water quality index wqi method has been used in this study to analyse the groundwater quality of coastal aquifers of the sbr area the concept of water quality index wqi was initiated by horton 1965 to assess the quality of surface and groundwater and its suitability for drinking purpose the method was improved by brown et al 1970 and the scottish development department 1975 the wqi method has been extensively used to assess the quality of surface and groundwater by the researchers all over the world couillard and lefebvre 1985 sebastian and yamakanamardi 2013 stigter et al 2006a 2006b the values of multiple water quality parameters are summarized numerically to form a single value wqi that is easily understandable and is used to assess the spatial variation of water quality in a region krishan et al 2016a in india the method has also been used by many researchers bora and goswami 2017 rao et al 2017 singh and hussian 2016 the wealth of literature proves that the wqi method is efficient to assess the groundwater quality in any region therefore the method may be used for groundwater quality assessment in the sbr 2 study area the sbr area extending from 21 33 32 62 n to 22 38 15 66 n and 88 2 27 42 e to 89 5 46 06 e is a part of the ganges brahmaputra delta fig 1 it lies in the southern part of west bengal india the total area of the sbr is 9630 sq km out of that 5367 sq km is forest cleared habitation area which is divided into nineteen community development cd blocks out of these nineteen cd blocks six fall under the north 24 parganas and thirteen fall under the south 24

2010 2014 the aquifer occurring between 70 and 160 m bgl is brackish to saline in nature and the fresh aquifer occurs between 160 and 400 m bgl ibid in different parts of the sbr the occurrence of saline and freshwater aquifers in the sbr has been shown in fig 2 two separate brackish saline water aquifers are present in the western part of the sbr while one exists in the east out of five separate fresh water bearing aquifers in the west three extend up to the middle at canning i there are five separate freshwater aquifers at canning i marked d between 160 and 400 m bgl the bottom most aquifer extends towards the east up to gosaba where it attains a thickness of 45 m other four aquifers extend towards south and southeast direction the deep aquifers of sundarbans are a part of sonar bangla aquifer system and have been confined by thick clay layer namely ichamati bhagirathi hugli aquitard near a line between kolkata and bashirhat mukherjee 2006 the recharge zone of the confined aquifers of sundarbans is above the kolkata bashirhat region the annual groundwater flow through shallow and deep aquifer has been estimated as 11 68 and 18 25 million cubic metres mcm respectively by sinha roy 2014 mukherjee et al 2007a estimated the subsurface groundwater discharge through the delta front in north and south 24 parganas as 59 mcm year and the annual seawater intrusion as 0 00088 mcm deep tube wells spot water sources serve as the main source of potable water in the region groundwater based piped water supply covers only 32 percent of households in the sbr world bank 2014 the quality of the spot or piped water is not always suitable for drinking some spot water sources are affected by saline water intrusion and are prone to coliform contamination during floods ibid significant modification of the shallow groundwater chemistry occurs due to the seawater intrusion in the aquifers of north and south 24 parganas mukherjee et al 2007b mukherjee and fryar 2008 groundwater chemistry in deltaic west bengal is mostly dominated by ca hco3 with some na cl dominated water bhadra et al 2018 mukherjee 2009 the dominance of na cl and hco3 has been observed in the

hingalganj sandeshkhali ii canning i canning ii and jaynagar i this may be the result of overexploitation of comparatively less saline shallow groundwater in these administrative blocks for agriculture and other purposes in this perspective the present study is aimed to analyse the hydro geochemical characteristics of deep and shallow groundwater and their potability in the sbr region 3 methodology groundwater samples were collected from sixty existing well distributed hand pump operated deep tube wells 140m 340m during pre monsoon february and post monsoon november period thirty number of piezometers were constructed in shallow aquifers 50m and the water samples from the piezometers were collected during the same period before assessing the groundwater quality of the sbr area the water samples were analysed and the charge balance error huh et al 1998 kundu and nag 2018 for each groundwater samples were estimated to check the accuracy of the chemical analysis the ranges of the charge balance error were 5 00 to 4 99 for pre monsoon deep aquifer water samples 4 56 to 4 96 for post monsoon deep aquifer water samples 4 99 to 0 89 for pre monsoon shallow aquifer water samples and 4 96 to 4 94 for post monsoon shallow aquifer water samples to assess the groundwater quality of the region ten water quality parameters namely ph total dissolved solids tds electrical conductivity ec chloride cl sulphate so4 bicarbonate hco3 total hardness th calcium ca magnesium mg and sodium na were studied the average concentration along with the standard deviation of each water quality parameters of shallow aquifers and deep aquifers were estimated in the study two tailed paired t test has been performed to assess the seasonal change of the water quality parameters from pre monsoon to post monsoon season the location latitude and longitude of each groundwater sampling points were used to prepare spatial distribution map and temporal change pre monsoon and post monsoon map of the above water quality parameters the inverse distance weighted idw interpolation technique was used to prepare theses maps the ph was measured using ph meter with a precision of 0 01 unit and accuracy of 0 05 ec was measured using electrical conductivity meter and the precision and accuracy of the measurement were 1 μs per cm and 0 01 respectively tds was calculated from ec the precision and accuracy of that calculation were 0 1 mg l and 0 02 total hardness was measured by adding eriochrome black t ebt indicator to the water sample containing calcium and magnesium ions at a ph 10 0 1 and then titrating with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta which helps to form a complex of calcium and magnesium ions the precision and accuracy of that calculation were 0 1 mg l and 0 4 respectively calcium was measured using edta titrimetric method with a precision of 0 1 mg l and accuracy of 0 5 magnesium was measured as the difference between total hardness and calcium hardness and the measurement precision and precision were 0 1 mg l and 0 3 respectively sodium was measured by flame emission photometry method with a precision of 0 1 mg l and accuracy of 0 8 chloride was measured in a neutral or slightly alkaline solution by titration with standard silver nitrate solution using potassium chromate as indicator and the measurement precision and accuracy were 0 1 mg l and 0 5 respectively estimation of sulphate concentration was done by measuring the light absorbance measured by a photometer of the barium sulphate which was the precipitate of sulphate ion in an acetic acid medium precision and accuracy of that measurement were 0 1 mg l and 0 3 respectively the bicarbonate ion concentration was determined by using an automated titrator 905 titrando metrohm switzerland with a precision of 0 1 mg l and accuracy of 0 2 the accuracy of the instrument was tested by preparing sodium bicarbonate solution of known strength hydrological facies of the shallow and deep water samples were identified using the piper trilinear diagram piper 1944 the piper diagram uses separate ternary plots to show the percentage concentrations of major cations na ca mg and anions hco3 so4 cl a diamond shaped plot in the diagram identifies the different types of groundwater kumar et al 2014 to calculate the percentage concentration of each cation and anion the concentration unit milligram per litre was converted to milli equivalents per litre the chloride bicarbonate ratios chidambaram et al 2018 nwankwoala and udom 2011 martos et al 1999 were calculated to study the seawater intrusion in the coastal aquifers of the sbr based on available water quality parameters the wqi eq 1 was computed using weighted arithmetic index method bora and goswami 2017 brown et al 1970 based on the wqi the quality of water was classified into five categories i e excellent good poor very poor and unsuitable for drinking after tyagi et al 2013 1 w q i q n w n w n 2 q n 100 v n v

permissible limits of the water quality parameters as per the indian council of medical research icmr 1975 world health organization who 2011 and european commission 1998 are also consulted for those parameters for which the bis standard values are not available the constant of proportionality k was estimated using equation 4 eq 4 in the study 4 k 1 1 v s 1 2 3 n existing initiatives and some suggestions to improve the potability of the groundwater in the sbr area have been focused at the end of the study 4 result discussion 4 1 ground water chemistry potability the range of ph tds ec th cl so4 hco3 ca mg and na their mean concentration and standard deviation in the shallow and deep water samples during pre monsoon and post monsoon season are summarized in table 1 the drinking water standards desirable and permissible limit of the parameters the percentage of samples below the desirable limit within the desirable and permissible limit and above the permissible limit are shown in table 2 the concentrations of most of the parameters except ph are comparatively high in the shallow aquifer than the deep aquifer table 1 the ph value of water generally indicates the degree of acidity or alkalinity bora and goswami 2017 the average ph value of most of the shallow and deep aquifer water samples in sbr area are within bis desirable limit tables 1 and 2 the study shows that the groundwater in the region is slightly alkaline as the average ph value is more than 7 it may be due to the high concentration of bicarbonate in the groundwater kumar et al 2014 ph value of the groundwater samples significantly decrease p values 0 05 from pre monsoon to post monsoon season due to the monsoonal recharge based on tds values water in the study region are classified into four broad categories freshwater 1000 mg l brackish water 1000 10 000 mg l saline water 10 000 100 000 mg l and brine water 100 000 mg l after subramani et al 2005 the electrical conductivity ec is also a measure of water salinity the high tds 802 38 048 mg l and ec 1336 67 63413 33 mg l values table 1 of the shallow aquifer samples indicate that shallow groundwater in sbr is saline in nature which may be a result of seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers most of the shallow groundwater samples in the sbr fall outside the permissible limit of tds and ec table 2 therefore the shallow groundwater is unsuitable for drinking purpose most of the deep groundwater samples are however found within the permissible limit table 2 during the pre monsoon season 20 of deep groundwater samples are considered as brackish and remaining 80 samples are considered as fresh in post monsoon only 5 of samples remain brackish indicating significant monsoonal recharging in the region upstream of kolkata basirhat line the origin of brackish deep groundwater in the sbr area might be explained by the vertical mixing of shallow saline ground water with deep fresh ground water due to the bore leakage which is caused by casing or well screen corrosion tds and ec value of the groundwater samples significantly decrease p value 0 05 from pre monsoon to post monsoon season due to the dilution effect of monsoonal recharge bicarbonate hco3 is the dominant anion in the sbr area followed by chloride cl and sulphate so4 in the deep aquifer the average concentration of hco3 437 20 446 36 mg l cl 225 48 235 60 and so4 10 25 11 52 mg l are within the permissible limit tables 1 and 2 in shallow aquifer the average concentration of hco3 936 56 969 56 mg l and cl 8424 16 10061 66 are above the permissible limit tables 1 and 2 the concentration of so4 373 46 385 52 mg l is within the permissible limit but above the desirable limit tables 1 and 2 weathering of calcite dolomite and silicate minerals eqs 7 8 and 11 dissolution of carbonate precipitates atmospheric and soil co2 gas eq 5 and 6 are commonly responsible for the increasing bicarbonate concentration in groundwater jeong 2001 kumar et al 2012 2014 the high chloride concentration is a result of weathering and dissolution of salt deposits and seawater intrusion jeevanandam et al 2012 kumar et al 2014 paleo seawater entrapped in sediments are another source of chloride ions in the groundwater walker et al 1991 natural sulphate in rainwater dissolution of gypsum and anhydride eq 9 and 10 in the recharge zone seawater contamination of untreated industrial domestic waste agriculture fertilizers may be responsible for the high concentration of sulphate baruah et al 2008 han et al 2016 jeevanandam et al 2012 kumar et al 2014 hco3 and so4 concentration in the groundwater samples do not change significantly p value 0 05 from pre monsoon to post monsoon season the cl concentration in shallow aquifer water samples changes significantly p value 0 05 from pre monsoon to post monsoon season but no significant change is observed in deep aquifer water samples sodium na is the dominant cation in the region followed my magnesium mg and calcium ca replacement of ca and mg ions by the na due to reverse cation exchange process eq 12 howden and mather 2012 maybe the reason for a lower concentration of ca and mg in the study area the average concentration of na 212 62 214 22 mg l and mg 22 94 33 35 mg l in deep aquifer are very close to desirable limit whereas the concentration of ca 31 17 39 35 mg l is within the desirable limit tables 1 and 2 in shallow aquifer the average concentration of na 4129 28 6120 76 mg l mg 670 50 692 55 mg l and ca 175 33 253 88 mg l are above the permissible limit tables 1 and 2 dissolution of soil salts in the groundwater silicate weathering eq 11 in the recharge zone may be responsible for the high concentration of sodium in the sundarbans hem 1985 kumar et al 2012 2014 stallard and edmond 1983 sodium concentration remains high in pre monsoon season due to over exploitation of groundwater in coastal regions whereas it decreases from pre monsoon to post monsoon season the change is significant p values 0 05 in shallow aquifer but not very significant in deep aquifer dissolution of precipitates of silicates calcite dolomite gypsum and anhydride minerals eqs 7 11 in the recharge zone may be responsible for high calcium and magnesium concentration in the region chandrasekar et al 2014 lakshmanan et al 2003 kumar et al 2012 2014 srinivas et al 2017 the concentration of ca in deep and shallow aquifer increases almost significantly from pre monsoon to post monsoon season the mg concentration in deep aquifer significantly decreases from pre monsoon to post monsoon season however in shallow aquifer its concentration increases but the change is not very significant the increase of ca and mg concentration in the groundwater is mostly due to the acceleration of the dilution process caused by monsoonal recharge these minerals were mainly carried by the river ganges and deposited in the delta plain the chemical weathering process in the recharge zone where the confined aquifers of sundarbans become unconfined has been explained in the following equations garrels and mackenzie 1971 holland 1978 peiyue et al 2011 sarin et al 1989 5 h 2

th in the studied water samples range from 232 80 to 5777 92 mg l in shallow aquifer and 31 30 974 40 mg l in the deep aquifer table 1 it denotes that shallow groundwater in sbr region is very hard 180 mg l in nature whereas the hardness of deep groundwater is comparatively less total hardness value of the groundwater samples do not changed significantly p value 0 05 from pre monsoon to post monsoon season blockwise distribution of the groundwater quality gwq parameters in the sbr has been shown in figs 3 and 4 in the shallow aquifer the concentration of ph ca mg and th are high in the southern blocks in deep aquifer a high concentration of these parameters is observed in the northern blocks a high concentration of tds ec and na in the shallow and deep aquifer are observed in those regions which are close to estuaries a high concentration of cl and hco3 in the shallow aquifer are observed in southern and some central blocks in the deep aquifer the concentrations are high in northern and southern blocks high so4 concentration in the shallow and deep aquifer are observed in some central blocks and the southern blocks for shallow aquifer only 4 2 groundwater types occurrence of salinity the groundwater quality parameters of shallow and deep aquifer during pre and post monsoon season have been plotted on the piper trilinear diagram fig 5 to identify the hydrological facies the study shows that the shallow groundwater in the study area is mainly na cl type which indicates the saline water intrusion process in shallow aquifer pulido leboeuf 2004 in deep aquifer na hco3 na cl and mixed type groundwater are observed during pre and post monsoon period probably the ca mg hco3 type water in recharge zone cgwb 2007 becomes na hco3 type in the coastal area due to the flushing of salinized sediments previously subjected to seawater intrusion by the freshwater howden and mather 2012 versluys 1916 according to versluys 1916 the occurrence of na hco3 in the coastal aquifer can also be explained by the process of cation exchange eq 12 howden and mather 2012 the piper plot shows that alkali na dominates over alkaline earth ca mg in the shallow and deep aquifer it is a result of the ion exchange process the strong acids cl so4 dominates over week acid hco3 in the shallow aquifer due to the interaction of saline seawater in deep aquifer the week acid dominates due to the presence of fresh water the chloride bicarbonate ratio has been calculated to assess the seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers as the chloride is most common anion in seawater whereas bicarbonate is dominant anion in groundwater satishkumar et al 2016 in the sbr region the cl hco3 ratio ranges from 2 68 to 36 91 during pre monsoon period and from 2 36 to 28 62 during post monsoon period in shallow aquifer in deep aquifer the ratio ranges from 0 04 to 7 17 in pre monsoon season and from 0 10 to 2 12 in post monsoon season fig 6 in shallow aquifer the ratio has a positive relation with chloride concentration which indicates mixing of saline water with shallow groundwater the groundwater can be classified into three broad categories based on cl hco3 ratio these are unaffected 0 5 slightly affected or moderately affected 0 6 6 6 and strongly affected 6 6 by salinization process fig 6 chidambaram et al 2018 sheikhy narany et al 2014 revelle 1941 todd 1959 the study shows that 86 67 and 56 67 shallow groundwater samples are strongly influenced by saline water during pre and post monsoon period the deep groundwater is mostly unaffected by saline water around 33 33 and 41 67 deep groundwater samples are moderately affected by the saline water during pre and post monsoon season it is mainly due to the vertical mixing of fresh groundwater with the saline water of shallow aquifers through defective boreholes which are not functioning well due to leakage caused by casing or well screen corrosion the samples moderately affected by saline water intrusion are located near the estuaries or sea 4 3 groundwater quality index based on the water quality parameters water quality index has been estimated to assess the overall condition of the shallow and deep aquifer in the study area in shallow aquifer wqi ranges from 101 93 to 1394 40 during pre monsoon season and from 56 16 to 1272 52 during post monsoon season in deep aquifer the value ranges from 60 96 to 143 17 during pre monsoon and from 11 87 to 91 23 during post monsoon season the study shows that most of the water samples in shallow aquifer are not suitable for drinking table 3 in deep aquifer most of the samples are drinkable but their quality is poor table 3 therefore the people of sundarban mostly depend on deep groundwater to meet their potable water need high water quality index values are observed in namkhana patharpratima sagar and basanti blocks in shallow aquifer fig 7 in deep aquifer high water quality index values are observed in patharpratima canning i canning ii kultali gosaba and hingalganj fig 7 4 4 improving potability of the groundwater fresh groundwater is being pumped rapidly from the deep aquifer depletion of deep groundwater may result in changing hydraulic gradient from the sea to the land as the aquifers are hydraulically connected to the sea as a result the intrusion of saltwater from the sea toward fresh deep aquifers on the land might occur in the near future to avoid the groundwater contamination due to saline water intrusion in the future withdrawal of groundwater from deep aquifer has to be restricted switching to treated surface water or shallow groundwater rather than extensive deep groundwater exploitation may be a sustainable alternative for drinking water supply in the sundarbans mukherjee 2006 excess rainwater can be recharged artificially within shallow aquifer to dilute its salinity due course of time this technique may help to reduce the salinity of shallow aquifer and then the water of shallow aquifer may be utilized for agriculture and domestic purpose gayen 2009 hazra et al 2019 and may also be used as potable water after proper treatment dilution of the brackish aquifer through rooftop rainwater harvesting might be an option to improve the availability of potable water in the sbr experiments were undertaken by the world bank at baliachandi in jaynagar i block and jharkhali in basanti block of south 24 parganas to dilute brackish shallow aquifers with the harvested rainwater fig 8 a in this method rainwater from the rooftop is collected in below ground level reservoir via a brickbat filter bed the reservoir is connected with the borewell through a pipe fitted with a check valve fig 8b initial pumping of the handheld tube well creates the vacuum and when the check valve is opened water from the reservoir 1 m 1 2 m x1 2m rushes into the aquifer and thus facilitates the artificial recharge process the initial salinity of shallow groundwater at jharkhali 1 jharkhali 2 beliachandi 1 and beliachandi 2 was 27 5 psu 30 psu 3 2 psu and 2 psu respectively fig 8c after the artificial recharge the salinity of the shallow groundwater of those study points had reduced to 3 psu 5 psu 0 5 psu and 0 55 psu fig 8c the salinity slightly increased after the six months of the artificial recharge and became 3 8 psu 7 5 psu 1 5 psu and 2 5 psu respectively fig 8c the experiment successfully establishes that due to the dilution effect the quality of brackish water has improved and become suitable for the domestic purpose other than drinking water however the pilot study did not get much focus and therefore not practiced in large scale to improve the availability of potable water other than drinking in the region there is a huge scope to improve freshwater availability in the region if the method could be adopted and implemented in the entire sundarbans region the brackish water occurs within 100 150 m depth having 3000 5000 mg l tds can also be desalinized and used for drinking purpose this effort has been initiated by phed public health engineering department govt of west bengal using solar energy based pumps for groundwater withdrawal the desalinization will be carried out based on membrane technology coupled with reverse osmosis ro technique the seawater or saline estuarine water can also be treated using ro technology to produce potable water few ro plants were installed for providing salt free water in sundarbans world bank 2014 the ro plants however failed to produce potable water due to the high concentration of silt in river water and high salinity 15 psu such type of desalination can be tried using silt free less saline 4 8 psu water of the shallow aquifer 5 conclusion groundwater in sundarbans is under stress due to its increasing demand and limited supply for sustainable management of this only potable water resource a qualitative assessment of groundwater in the sbr area has been carried out in the study the study shows that the concentrations of the chemical parameters in the shallow aquifer are above the permissible limit and within the desirable limit in deep aquifer the study finds that the groundwater in the sbr region belongs to nahco3 nacl and mixed type hydro geochemical facies the cl hco3 ratio indicates the influence of saline water intrusion in the shallow aquifers in sbr based on available water quality parameters the water quality index has been estimated in the study the water quality index reveals that most of the water samples in shallow aquifer are not suitable for drinking deep aquifer water samples are drinkable but the quality is poor therefore the people of sundarbans depend on deep groundwater to meet their potable water need available freshwater is not adequate to meet the potable water need of the future population in sundarbans therefore to improve freshwater availability switching to treated surface water artificial recharge to the shallow aquifer rainwater harvesting

12087,the sundarban biosphere reserve sbr of india lies in the southwestern part of the ganges brahmaputra delta the sbr traversed by tidal creeks and rivulets suffers perennially from the scarcity of freshwater in spite of heavy precipitation in monsoon months rivers in sundarbans are saline in nature with brackish groundwater in the subsurface fresh groundwater is mainly available from the confined aquifers and occurs at a depth range of 160 400 m below ground level the 4 43 million population in the sbr depend fully on deep groundwater to meet their drinking water demand it is therefore necessary to assess the quality of groundwater to fulfil the sustainable development goal the water quality index wqi has been estimated for shallow and deep aquifers based on water quality parameters like ph tds ec cl so4 hco3 th ca mg and na the dominant cations are found in the order na mg ca and dominant anions in the order hco3 cl so4 the groundwater in the sbr region belongs to nahco3 nacl and mixed type hydro geochemical facies the cl hco3 ratio indicates that the shallow aquifers are affected by the saline water intrusion following the limit set by the bureau of indian standards the shallow groundwater in the sbr is found to be unsuitable for drinking although the deep groundwater is within the permissible limit of safe drinking water its quality is poor the coastal regulation zone notification of 2011 has identified the sbr region as critically vulnerable coastal area and restricted the use of deep freshwater for drinking purpose only the paper argues that to meet the goal of sustainable development and safe drinking water for all in the future extensive rainwater harvesting and supply of treated surface water through pipeline and desalination of subsurface brackish water are some of the feasible options in the region graphical abstract image 1 keywords sundarbans groundwater quality coastal aquifer water quality index 1 introduction

natural and anthropogenic reasons bhadra et al 2017 and the shallow groundwater is not suitable for drinking bhadra et al 2018 gayen 2009 sinha roy 2010 2014 world bank 2014 therefore 4 43 million people of the sbr have to depend only on deep groundwater to meet their potable water demand almost 70 of the total population in the sbr has no access to safe drinking water world bank 2014 due to inadequate household water supply sanitation and hygiene around 1925 deaths and over 1 5 million cases of diarrhoea were reported in 2008 world bank 2014 in these circumstances it is highly essential

coastal aquifers of west bengal especially in the sbr which are vulnerable due to overexploitation and interaction with saline river water at shallow level bhadra et al 2013 2018 hazra et al 2019 the previous studies are very non systematic and irregular it s not possible to get an overall idea about groundwater quality of the entire region from those studies and not also possible to assess the temporal change of groundwater quality from those studies in this circumstance the aim of the study is to prepare a baseline of groundwater quality in the entire indian sundarbans region as well to assess the potability of the water in the vulnerable delta it would be easier for future researchers to assess temporal change of groundwater quality based on the present baseline study water quality index wqi method has been used in this study to analyse the groundwater quality of coastal aquifers of the sbr area the concept of water quality index wqi was initiated by horton 1965 to assess the quality of surface and groundwater and its suitability for drinking purpose the method was improved by brown et al 1970 and the scottish development department 1975 the wqi method has been extensively used to assess the quality of surface and groundwater by the researchers all over the world couillard and lefebvre 1985 sebastian and yamakanamardi 2013 stigter et al 2006a 2006b the values of multiple water quality parameters are summarized numerically to form a single value wqi that is easily understandable and is used to assess the spatial variation of water quality in a region krishan et al 2016a in india the method has also been used by many researchers bora and goswami 2017 rao et al 2017 singh and hussian 2016 the wealth of literature proves that the wqi method is efficient to assess the groundwater quality in any region therefore the method may be used for groundwater quality assessment in the sbr 2 study area the sbr area extending from 21 33 32 62 n to 22 38 15 66 n and

bangla aquifer system and have been confined by thick clay layer namely ichamati bhagirathi hugli aquitard near a line between kolkata and bashirhat mukherjee 2006 the recharge zone of the confined aquifers of sundarbans is above the kolkata bashirhat region the annual groundwater flow through shallow and deep aquifer has been estimated as 11 68 and 18 25 million cubic metres mcm respectively by sinha roy 2014 mukherjee et al 2007a estimated the subsurface groundwater discharge through the delta front in north and south 24 parganas as 59 mcm year and the annual seawater intrusion as 0 00088 mcm deep tube wells spot water sources serve as the main source of potable water in the region groundwater based piped water supply covers only 32 percent of households in the sbr world bank 2014 the quality of the spot or piped water is not always suitable for drinking some spot water sources are affected by saline water intrusion and are prone to coliform contamination during floods ibid significant modification of the shallow groundwater chemistry occurs due to the seawater intrusion in the aquifers of north and south 24 parganas mukherjee et al 2007b mukherjee and fryar 2008 groundwater chemistry in deltaic west bengal is mostly dominated by ca hco3 with some na cl dominated water bhadra et al 2018 mukherjee 2009 the dominance of na cl and hco3 has been observed in the isolated deep confined aquifers of lower delta plain mukherjee and fryar 2008 about eight blocks of sundarbans out of nineteen are arsenic affected mukherjee 2006 these are haroa hasnabad minakhan hingalganj sandeshkhali ii canning i canning ii and jaynagar i this may be the result of overexploitation of comparatively less saline shallow groundwater in these administrative blocks for agriculture and other purposes in this perspective the present study is aimed to analyse the hydro geochemical characteristics of deep and shallow groundwater and their potability in the sbr region 3 methodology groundwater samples were collected from sixty existing well distributed hand pump operated deep tube wells 140m 340m during pre monsoon february and post monsoon november period thirty number of piezometers were constructed in shallow aquifers 50m and the water samples from the piezometers were collected during the same period before assessing the groundwater quality of the sbr area the water samples were analysed and the charge balance error huh et al 1998 kundu and nag 2018 for each groundwater samples were estimated to check the accuracy of the chemical analysis the ranges of the charge balance error were 5 00 to 4 99 for pre monsoon deep aquifer water samples 4 56 to 4 96 for post monsoon deep aquifer water samples 4 99 to 0 89 for pre monsoon shallow aquifer water samples and 4 96 to 4 94 for post monsoon shallow aquifer water samples to assess the groundwater quality of the region ten water quality parameters namely ph total dissolved solids tds electrical conductivity ec chloride cl sulphate so4 bicarbonate hco3 total hardness th calcium ca magnesium mg and sodium na were studied the average concentration along with the standard deviation of each water quality parameters of shallow aquifers and deep aquifers were estimated in the study two tailed paired t test has been performed to assess the seasonal change of the water quality parameters from pre monsoon to post monsoon season the location latitude and longitude of each groundwater sampling points were used to prepare spatial distribution map and temporal change pre monsoon and post monsoon map of the above water quality parameters the inverse distance weighted idw interpolation technique was used to prepare theses maps the ph was measured using ph meter with a precision of 0 01 unit and accuracy of 0 05 ec was measured using electrical conductivity meter and the precision and accuracy of the measurement were 1 μs per cm and 0 01 respectively tds was calculated from ec the precision and accuracy of that calculation were 0 1 mg l and 0 02 total hardness was measured by adding eriochrome black t ebt indicator to the water sample containing calcium and magnesium ions at a ph 10 0 1 and then titrating with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta which helps to form a complex of calcium and magnesium ions the precision and accuracy of that calculation were 0 1 mg l and 0 4 respectively calcium was measured using edta titrimetric method with a precision of 0 1 mg l and accuracy of 0 5 magnesium was measured as the difference between total hardness and calcium hardness and the measurement precision and precision were 0 1 mg l and 0 3 respectively sodium was measured by flame emission photometry method with a precision of 0 1 mg l and accuracy of 0 8 chloride was measured in a neutral or slightly alkaline solution by titration with standard silver nitrate solution using potassium chromate as indicator and the measurement precision and accuracy were 0 1 mg l and 0 5 respectively estimation of sulphate concentration was done by measuring the light absorbance measured by a photometer of the barium sulphate which was the precipitate of sulphate ion in an acetic acid medium precision and accuracy of that measurement were 0 1 mg l and 0 3 respectively the bicarbonate ion concentration was determined by using an automated titrator 905 titrando metrohm switzerland with a precision of 0 1 mg l and accuracy of 0 2 the accuracy of the instrument was tested by preparing sodium bicarbonate solution of known strength hydrological facies of the shallow and deep water samples were identified using the piper trilinear diagram piper 1944 the piper diagram uses separate ternary plots to show the percentage concentrations of major cations na ca mg and anions hco3 so4 cl a diamond shaped plot in the diagram identifies the different types of groundwater kumar et al 2014 to calculate the percentage concentration of each cation and anion the concentration unit milligram per litre was converted to milli equivalents per litre the chloride bicarbonate ratios chidambaram et al 2018 nwankwoala and udom 2011 martos et al 1999 were calculated to study the seawater intrusion in the coastal aquifers of the sbr based on available water quality parameters the wqi eq 1 was computed using weighted arithmetic index method bora and goswami 2017 brown et al 1970 based on the wqi the quality of water was classified into five categories i e excellent good poor very poor and unsuitable for drinking after tyagi et al 2013 1 w q i q n w n w n 2 q n 100 v n v

v i 0 except for ph v i 7 v s is the standard desirable value for the nth water quality parameter in mg l according to the guideline of the bureau of indian standards bis 1991 the desirable permissible limits of the water quality parameters as per the indian council of medical research icmr 1975 world health organization who 2011 and european commission 1998 are also consulted for those parameters for which the bis standard values are not available the constant of proportionality k was estimated using equation 4 eq 4 in the study 4 k 1 1 v s 1 2 3 n existing initiatives and some suggestions to improve the potability of the groundwater in the sbr area have been focused at the end of the study 4 result discussion 4 1 ground water chemistry potability the range of ph tds ec th cl so4 hco3 ca mg and na their mean concentration and standard deviation in the shallow and deep water samples during pre monsoon and post monsoon season are summarized in table 1 the drinking water standards desirable and permissible limit of the parameters the percentage of samples below the desirable limit within the desirable and permissible limit and above the permissible limit are shown in table 2 the concentrations of most of the parameters except ph are comparatively high in the shallow aquifer than the deep aquifer table 1 the ph value of water generally indicates the degree of acidity or alkalinity bora and goswami 2017 the average ph value of most of the shallow and deep aquifer water samples in sbr area are within bis desirable limit tables 1 and 2 the study shows that the groundwater in the region is slightly alkaline as the average ph value is more than 7 it may be due to the high concentration of bicarbonate in the groundwater kumar et al 2014 ph value of the groundwater samples significantly decrease p values 0 05 from pre monsoon to post monsoon season due to the monsoonal recharge based on tds values water in the study region are classified into four broad categories freshwater 1000 mg l brackish water 1000 10 000 mg l saline water 10 000 100 000 mg l and brine water 100 000 mg l after subramani et al 2005 the electrical conductivity ec is also a measure of water salinity the high tds 802 38 048 mg l and ec 1336 67 63413 33 mg l values table 1 of the shallow aquifer samples indicate that shallow groundwater in sbr is saline in nature which may be a result of seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers most of the shallow groundwater samples in the sbr fall outside the permissible limit of tds and ec table 2 therefore the shallow groundwater is unsuitable for drinking purpose most of the deep groundwater samples are however found within the permissible limit table 2 during the pre monsoon season 20 of deep groundwater samples are considered as brackish and remaining 80 samples are considered as fresh in post monsoon only 5 of samples remain brackish indicating significant monsoonal recharging in the region upstream of kolkata basirhat line the origin of brackish deep groundwater in the sbr area might be explained by the vertical mixing of shallow saline ground water with deep fresh ground water due to the bore leakage which is caused by casing or well screen corrosion tds and ec value of the groundwater samples significantly decrease p value 0 05 from pre monsoon to post monsoon season due to the dilution effect of monsoonal recharge bicarbonate hco3 is the dominant anion in the sbr area followed by chloride cl and sulphate so4 in the deep aquifer the average concentration of hco3 437 20 446 36 mg l cl 225 48 235 60 and so4 10 25 11 52 mg l are within the permissible limit tables 1 and 2 in shallow aquifer the average concentration of hco3 936 56 969 56 mg l and cl 8424 16 10061 66 are above the permissible limit tables 1 and 2 the concentration of so4 373 46 385 52 mg l is within the permissible limit but above the desirable limit tables 1 and 2 weathering of calcite dolomite and silicate minerals eqs 7 8 and 11 dissolution of carbonate precipitates atmospheric and soil co2 gas eq 5 and 6 are commonly responsible for the increasing bicarbonate concentration in groundwater jeong 2001 kumar et al 2012 2014 the high chloride concentration is a result of weathering and dissolution of salt deposits and seawater intrusion jeevanandam et al 2012 kumar et al 2014 paleo seawater entrapped in sediments are another source of chloride ions in the groundwater walker et al 1991 natural sulphate in rainwater dissolution of gypsum and anhydride eq 9 and 10 in the recharge zone seawater contamination of untreated industrial domestic waste agriculture fertilizers may be responsible for the high concentration of sulphate baruah et al 2008 han et al 2016 jeevanandam et al 2012 kumar et al 2014 hco3 and so4 concentration in the groundwater samples do not change significantly p value 0 05 from pre monsoon to post monsoon season the cl concentration in shallow aquifer water samples changes significantly p value 0 05 from pre monsoon to post monsoon season but no significant change is observed in deep aquifer water samples sodium na is the dominant cation in the region followed my magnesium mg and calcium ca replacement of ca and mg ions by the na due to reverse cation exchange process eq 12 howden and mather 2012 maybe the reason for a lower concentration of ca and mg in the study area the average concentration of na 212 62 214 22 mg l and mg 22 94 33 35 mg l in deep aquifer are very close to desirable limit whereas the concentration of ca 31 17 39 35 mg l is within the desirable limit tables 1 and 2 in shallow aquifer the average concentration of na 4129 28 6120 76 mg l mg 670 50 692 55 mg l and ca 175 33 253 88 mg l are above the permissible limit tables 1 and 2 dissolution of soil salts in the groundwater silicate weathering eq 11 in the recharge zone may be responsible for the high concentration of sodium in the sundarbans hem 1985 kumar et al 2012 2014 stallard and edmond 1983 sodium concentration remains high in pre monsoon season due to over exploitation of groundwater in coastal regions whereas it decreases from pre monsoon to post monsoon season the change is significant p values 0 05 in shallow aquifer but not very significant in deep aquifer dissolution of precipitates of silicates calcite dolomite gypsum and anhydride minerals eqs 7 11 in the recharge zone may be responsible for high calcium and magnesium concentration in the region chandrasekar et al 2014 lakshmanan et al 2003 kumar et al 2012 2014 srinivas et al 2017 the concentration of ca in deep and shallow aquifer increases almost significantly from pre monsoon to post monsoon season the mg concentration in deep aquifer significantly decreases from pre monsoon to post monsoon season however in shallow aquifer its concentration increases but the change is not very significant the increase of ca and mg concentration in the groundwater is mostly due to the acceleration of the dilution process caused by monsoonal recharge these minerals were mainly carried by the river ganges and deposited in the delta plain the chemical weathering process in the recharge zone where the confined aquifers of sundarbans become unconfined has been explained in the following equations garrels and mackenzie 1971 holland 1978 peiyue et al 2011 sarin et al 1989 5 h 2

th in the studied water samples range from 232 80 to 5777 92 mg l in shallow aquifer and 31 30 974 40 mg l in the deep aquifer table 1 it denotes that shallow groundwater in sbr region is very hard 180 mg l in nature whereas the hardness of deep groundwater is comparatively less total hardness value of the groundwater samples do not changed significantly p value 0 05 from pre monsoon to post monsoon season blockwise distribution of the groundwater quality gwq parameters in the sbr has been shown in figs 3 and 4 in the shallow aquifer the concentration of ph ca mg and th are high in the southern blocks in deep aquifer a high concentration of these parameters is observed in the northern blocks a high concentration of tds ec and na in the shallow and deep aquifer are observed in those regions which are close to estuaries a high concentration of cl and hco3 in the shallow aquifer are observed in southern and some central blocks in the deep aquifer the concentrations are high in northern and southern blocks high so4 concentration in the shallow and deep aquifer are observed in some central blocks and the southern blocks for shallow aquifer only 4 2 groundwater types occurrence of salinity the groundwater quality parameters of shallow and deep aquifer during pre and post monsoon season have been plotted on the piper trilinear diagram fig 5 to identify the hydrological facies the study shows that the shallow groundwater in the study area is mainly na cl type which indicates the saline water intrusion process in shallow aquifer pulido leboeuf 2004 in deep aquifer na hco3 na cl and mixed type groundwater are observed during pre and post monsoon period probably the ca mg hco3 type water in recharge zone cgwb 2007 becomes na hco3 type in the coastal area due to the flushing of salinized sediments previously subjected to seawater intrusion by the freshwater howden and mather 2012 versluys 1916 according to versluys 1916 the occurrence of na hco3 in the coastal aquifer can also be explained by the process of cation exchange eq 12 howden and mather 2012 the piper plot shows that alkali na dominates over alkaline earth ca mg in the shallow and deep aquifer it is a result of the ion exchange process the strong acids cl so4 dominates over week acid hco3 in the shallow aquifer due to the interaction of saline seawater in deep aquifer the week acid dominates due to the presence of fresh water the chloride bicarbonate ratio has been calculated to assess the seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers as the chloride is most common anion in seawater whereas bicarbonate is dominant anion in groundwater satishkumar et al 2016 in the sbr region the cl hco3 ratio ranges from 2 68 to 36 91 during pre monsoon period and from 2 36 to 28 62 during post monsoon period in shallow aquifer in deep aquifer the ratio ranges from 0 04 to 7 17 in pre monsoon season and from 0 10 to 2 12 in post monsoon season fig 6 in shallow aquifer the ratio has a positive relation with chloride concentration which indicates mixing of saline water with shallow groundwater the groundwater can be classified into three broad categories based on cl hco3 ratio these are unaffected 0 5 slightly affected or moderately affected 0 6 6 6 and strongly affected 6 6 by salinization process fig 6 chidambaram et al 2018 sheikhy narany et al 2014 revelle 1941 todd 1959 the study shows that 86 67 and 56 67 shallow groundwater samples are strongly influenced by saline water during pre and post monsoon period the deep groundwater is mostly unaffected by saline water around 33 33 and 41 67 deep groundwater samples are moderately affected by the saline water during pre and post monsoon season it is mainly due to the vertical mixing of fresh groundwater with the saline water of shallow aquifers through defective boreholes which are not functioning well due to leakage caused by casing or well screen corrosion the samples moderately affected by saline water intrusion are located near the estuaries or sea 4 3 groundwater quality index based on the water quality parameters water quality index has been estimated to assess the overall condition of the shallow and deep aquifer in the study area in shallow aquifer wqi ranges from 101 93 to 1394 40 during pre monsoon season and from 56 16 to 1272 52 during post monsoon season in deep aquifer the value ranges from 60 96 to 143 17 during pre monsoon and from 11 87 to 91 23 during post monsoon season the study shows that most of the water samples in shallow aquifer are not suitable for drinking table 3 in deep aquifer most of the samples are drinkable but their quality is poor table 3 therefore the people of sundarban mostly depend on deep groundwater to meet their potable water need high water quality index values are observed in namkhana patharpratima sagar and basanti blocks in shallow aquifer fig 7 in deep aquifer high water quality index values are observed in patharpratima canning i canning ii kultali gosaba and hingalganj fig 7 4 4 improving potability of the groundwater fresh groundwater is being pumped rapidly from the deep aquifer depletion of deep groundwater may result in changing hydraulic gradient from the sea to the land as the aquifers are hydraulically connected to the sea as a result the intrusion of saltwater from the sea toward fresh deep aquifers on the land might occur in the near future to avoid the groundwater contamination due to saline water intrusion in the future withdrawal of groundwater from deep aquifer has to be restricted switching to treated surface water or shallow groundwater rather than extensive deep groundwater exploitation may be a sustainable alternative for drinking water supply in the sundarbans mukherjee 2006 excess rainwater can be recharged artificially within shallow aquifer to dilute its salinity due course of time this technique may help to reduce the salinity of shallow aquifer and then the water of shallow aquifer may be utilized for agriculture and domestic purpose gayen 2009 hazra et al 2019 and may also be used as potable water after proper treatment dilution of the brackish aquifer through rooftop rainwater harvesting might be an option to improve the availability of potable water in the sbr experiments were undertaken by the world bank at baliachandi in jaynagar i block and jharkhali in basanti block of south 24 parganas to dilute brackish shallow aquifers with the harvested rainwater fig 8 a in this method rainwater from the rooftop is collected in below ground level reservoir via a brickbat filter bed the reservoir is connected with the borewell through a pipe fitted with a check valve fig 8b initial pumping of the handheld tube well creates the vacuum and when the check valve is opened water from the reservoir 1 m 1 2 m x1 2m rushes into the aquifer and thus facilitates the artificial recharge process the initial salinity of shallow groundwater at jharkhali 1 jharkhali 2 beliachandi 1 and beliachandi 2 was 27 5 psu 30 psu 3 2 psu and 2 psu respectively fig 8c after the artificial recharge the salinity of the shallow groundwater of those study points had reduced to 3 psu 5 psu 0 5 psu and 0 55 psu fig 8c the salinity slightly increased after the six months of the artificial recharge and became 3 8 psu 7 5 psu 1 5 psu and 2 5 psu respectively fig 8c the experiment successfully establishes that due to the dilution effect the quality of brackish water has improved and become suitable for the domestic purpose other than drinking water however the pilot study did not get much focus and therefore not practiced in large scale to improve the availability of potable water other than drinking in the region there is a huge scope to improve freshwater availability in the region if the method could be adopted and implemented in the entire sundarbans region the brackish water occurs within 100 150 m depth having 3000 5000 mg l tds can also be desalinized and used for drinking purpose this effort has been initiated by phed public health engineering department govt of west bengal using solar energy based pumps for groundwater withdrawal the desalinization will be carried out based on membrane technology coupled with reverse osmosis ro technique the seawater or saline estuarine water can also be treated using ro technology to produce potable water few ro plants were installed for providing salt free water in sundarbans world bank 2014 the ro plants however failed to produce potable water due to the high concentration of silt in river water and high salinity 15 psu such type of desalination can be tried using silt free less saline 4 8 psu water of the shallow aquifer 5 conclusion groundwater in sundarbans is under stress due to its increasing demand and limited supply for sustainable management of this only potable water resource a qualitative assessment of groundwater in the sbr area has been carried out in the study the study shows that the concentrations of the chemical parameters in the shallow aquifer are above the permissible limit and within the desirable limit in deep aquifer the study finds that the groundwater in the sbr region belongs to nahco3 nacl and mixed type hydro geochemical facies the cl hco3 ratio indicates the influence of saline water intrusion in the shallow aquifers in sbr based on available water quality parameters the water quality index has been estimated in the study the water quality index reveals that most of the water samples in shallow aquifer are not suitable for drinking deep aquifer water samples are drinkable but the quality is poor therefore the people of sundarbans depend on deep groundwater to meet their potable water need available freshwater is not adequate to meet the potable water need of the future population in sundarbans therefore to improve freshwater availability switching to treated surface water artificial recharge to the shallow aquifer rainwater harvesting

12088,least square support vector regression lssvr is a powerful data driven method for simulation and forecasting with two parameters to tune in this study these parameters were automatically tuned using the interior search algorithm isa and genetic algorithm ga the main purpose is in situ simulation and forecast of monthly groundwater level in karaj plain iran using historical groundwater level precipitation and evaporation data the results of the interior search algorithm least support vector regression isa lssvr and genetic algorithm least support vector regression ga lssvr compared with genetic programming gp and adaptive neural fuzzy inference system anfis based on average nash sutcliffe criterion the results revealed that the isa lssvr improves the simulation and forecasting accuracy compared to other methods also the results of the different model structure selection indicate that including precipitation and evaporation does not necessarily improve simulation and forecasting accuracy but it would increase uncertainty this increase suggests that groundwater level in the case study is affected by groundwater flow recharge from leaky urban water infrastructure and reduced recharge from precipitation due to impervious surfaces in urban areas rather than being solely governed by precipitation and evaporation finally a sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the impacts of optimization algorithm parameters on the simulation and forecasting accuracy the results indicate high and low sensitivity associated with ga and isa respectively in conclusion isa lssvr was suggested as the best model due to computational efficiency low sensitivity to its parameters and high accuracy compared to other methods graphical abstract image 1 keywords data driven methods genetic algorithm optimization karaj aquifer sensitivity analysis support vector machines 1 introduction with the increase of computational capability of computers the application of data driven methods in groundwater level simulation and forecasting has been increased artificial neural network ann adaptive neural fuzzy inference system anfis genetic programming gp and support vector regression svr can be mentioned as some of these methods several studies reported the use of ann coppola et al 2003 maier and dandy 2000 wunsch et al 2018 anfis gong et al 2016 moosavi et al 2013 shiri and kişi 2011 and gp fallah mehdipour et al 2013 2014 shiri et al 2013 for groundwater level simulation and forecasting although these methods provide some degree of flexibility and accuracy in groundwater modelling some demerits have been reported high uncertainty associated with ann was reported by yoon et al 2011 for groundwater level forecasting in a coastal aquifer over fitting of anfis was reported by fallah mehdipour et al 2013 in karaj plain and high computational demand to find solutions was stated as a major disadvantage of gp by meier et al 2013 the svr method first presented by vapnik 1995 is a relatively new data driven method in hydrology the svr has been applied to forecast groundwater level liu et al 2009 used a least square support vector regression lssvr based on chaos dynamic and a radial basis function rbf as the kernel to forecast groundwater level behzad et al 2010 modeled groundwater level under different pumping and weather conditions by ann and svr methods they used the rbf kernel and identified svr parameters by grid search gs svr the results indicated that the svr especially when the data is insufficient is more accurate and generalized in comparison to ann yoon et al 2011 compared ann and svr methods in groundwater level simulation in a coastal aquifer the results illustrated that the average error in svr method was lower than those in ann method also uncertainty analysis showed lower uncertainty for svr method shiri et al 2013 made a comparison between the ann anfis gp svr and autoregressive moving average arma methods for groundwater level forecasting the results showed that the gp has the highest capability to forecast groundwater level up to 7 days beyond the recorded data they chose rbf kernel and the svr parameters were tuned by trial and error none of these studies dealt with the urban aquifers the recharge of unconfined aquifers in urban areas is complex due to the impact of impervious surface as a result of urban development renouf et al 2019 and urbanization in general salvadore et al 2015 for example leakage from urban water infrastructure in this case the link between groundwater recharge and meteorological variables e g precipitation temperature etc might not be straightforward and linear data driven methods has potential to be used in this context previous studies showed that the svr results accuracy largely depends on tuning its parameters the svr theory doesn t provide any specific methodology for parameter selection su et al 2014 trial and error have been performed in previous studies behzad et al 2010 bhagwat and maity 2013 yoon et al 2011 trial and error approach is a time consuming process and greatly affects the svr results accuracy achieving a high accuracy with trial and error approach is computationally expensive because the model needs to be evaluated at various points within the grid for each parameter meta heuristic optimization algorithms can be used to overcome this limitation raghavendra and deka 2015 the meta heuristic optimization algorithms were successfully applied in many water resources problems bozorg haddad et al 2015 fayaz et al 2020 hosseini moghari et al 2015 2017 and their strength and weaknesses have been reviewed maier et al 2014 moravej 2017 2018 sörensen 2015 some meta heuristic optimization algorithms were employed to find svr parameters genetic algorithm ga was employed to choose the svr parameters ga svr to forecast monthly reservoir storage su et al 2014 monthly streamflow kalteh 2015 water quality parameters in rivers bozorg haddad et al 2017 soleimani et al 2016 daily reference evapotranspiration yin et al 2017 and water temperature quan et al 2020 bat algorithm particle swarm optimization pso and artificial bee colony were coupled with svr for streamflow forecasting xing et al 2016 river stage forecasting seo et al 2016 the results indicate that pso svr and abc svr provided better results compared to gs svr and ga svr similar studies in groundwater level simulation and forecasting is missing in addition all meta heuristics algorithms used for tuning the svr parameters suffer from having two or more parameters to tune themselves the sensitivity of the meta heuristic algorithms was reported in previous studies moravej 2017 2018 interior search algorithm isa is a new evolutionary algorithm which overcomes this limitation isa is proposed by gandomi 2014 showing its superiority over other optimization algorithms in a wide range of problems moravej and hosseini moghari 2016 tuned the isa parameter automatically using a linear equation as a function of optimization iteration therefore the isa algorithm potentially provides more reliability compared to other meta heuristic algorithms they employed the isa to solve three reservoir operation problems i e karun 4 four reservoir and ten reservoir operation problems they compared the results of the isa with other meta heuristic algorithms such as honey bee mating optimization hbmo water cycle algorithm wca biogeography based optimization bbo imperial competition algorithm ica cuckoo optimization algorithm coa ant colony optimization aco and bat algorithm from previous studies the results indicate that the isa outperform those algorithms in accuracy reliability and fast convergence i e efficiency groundwater is a vital source for municipal industrial and agricultural usages in karaj city iran supporting socio economic activities of more than 2 million people therefore developing a reliable tool for simulating and forecasting water level is of interest in this region in the current study the isa was employed to automatically tune the lssvr isa lssvr parameters for groundwater level simulation and forecasting in karaj plain the aim is to evaluate the capability of the proposed method in groundwater level simulation and forecast to tackle this 12 different model structures were considered and the result of isa lssvr in two separate categories of simulation and forecast were compared with ga coupled with lssvr ga lssvr gp and anfis 2 material and methods 2 1 the lssvr the lssvr method was developed by suykens et al 2002 it is a modified version of the original method which was introduced by vapnik 1995 the lssvr provides a computational advantage over the regular svr via converting a quadratic programming problem into a set of linear equations kalteh 2015 the main advantage of this conversion is mentioned as decrease in the computational complexity and cost adnan et al 2017 raghavendra deka 2015 therefore lssvr is used in this study over other original svr and its variants consider a given time series set of t dataset x t y t t 1 2 3 t where x t ℜ d is the tth input

variables su et al 2014 in addition it has fewer numerical restrictions and a smaller number of parameters compared with other kernel functions su et al 2014 7 k x x t e x x t 2 σ 2 where σ is the parameter of the rbf fig 1 shows an illustration of lssvr the selection of the parameters σ and γ highly affect the accuracy of this method here the isa is used to obtain the optimal values of these parameters 2 2 the isa isa is developed by gandomi 2014 the concept of the algorithm can be found in gandomi 2014 and moravej and hosseini moghari 2016 the isa procedure is summarized as follows in this algorithm solutions are called elements first the locations of elements and their fitness values σ and γ are determined between the lower lb and upper bounds ub the objective function is defined in the isa lssvr section the fittest element in kth iteration is named as x g b k all other elements are classified into either composition or mirror groups this classification is being done in a random manner using α as a threshold value and a random variable 0 r 1 1 in a way that all elements with α r 1 go to the composition group while others are being assigned into the mirror group tuning the α is of significance to obtain a balance between diversification and intensification gandomi 2014 to obtain the global best the random walk equation eq 8 is used to modify x g b k for local search around the global best 8 x g b k x g b k 1 r n λ where λ and rn are scale factor equal to 0 01 u b l b and vector of normally distributed random numbers equation 9 is used to randomly change the elements in the composition group r2 random value between 0 and 1 by changing the upper and lower bounds 9 x i k l b k u b k l b k r 2 for the elements of the mirror group eq 10 is used to modify the elements for each iteration using r3 a random value between 0 and 1 as follow 10 x m i k r 3 x i k 1 1 r 3 x g b k the location of the image or virtual location of the element is dependent on the mirror s location as 11 x i k 2 x m i k x i k 1 after finding the fitness values the following expression is used to update the each location for a minimization problem 12 x i k x i k f x i k f x i k 1 x i k 1 o t h e r w i s e the isa flowchart can be seen in moravej and hosseini moghari 2016 2 2 1 calculating α following moravej and hosseini moghari 2016 the α 0 1 is selected and it gradually goes up to 0 9 as optimization iteration lead to maximum iteration this approach is found as an efficient way to tune α moravej and hosseini moghari 2016 the lower value of α at the beginning of optimization encourages composition part of the isa optimization which is an effective exploration tool when the value of α is drifted to 0 9 by approaching the maximum iteration the optimization procedure encourages exploitation at the end of iterations by switching to mirror search gandomi and roke 2014 2 3 the isa lssvr the flowchart of isa lssvr algorithm is shown in fig 2 the content of the dotted box in fig 3 describes the procedure for determining the optimal parameters σ and γ the iteration number in optimization process starts from zero i 0 then the initial elements locations are determined using real random numbers three datasets of training validation and testing were defined training dataset is used to train lssvr in a way that the ns value in validation phase is maximized the reason was that the ns was objective function in the current study and it was calculated for the validation data set the validation error normally decreases during the initial phase of training as does the training set error however when the network begins to overfit the data the error on the validation set typically begins to rise araghinejad 2013 this selection aims to assure that the risk of overfitting is minimal finally the testing dataset is used to provide an unbiased evaluation of the final model and it is used to make a judgment on the model accuracy the optimization stops when either the maximum value of the ns value ns 1 see section 2 6 or 500 function evaluations are reached number of function evaluations is the number of times the objective function is calculated during the optimization process typically function evaluations equal to multiplying the number of iteration by the population size however some optimization algorithms calculate the objective function multiple times for each iteration thus the number of function evaluations in those algorithms becomes higher with the same number of iteration and population size therefore we need to compare the performance of optimization algorithms on number of function evaluations rather than number of iteration and population size more information on how ga can automatically tune the svr parameters can be found in su et al 2014 and kalteh 2015 2 4 study area the case study is located in the northwest of karaj plain in iran the aquifer is an unconfined quaternary alluvial aquifer with deposits of sand gravel clay chitsazan et al 2017 the results of the geophysical studies in this area show that the thickness of alluvium in the northern areas is about 50 100 m chitsazan et al 2017 the drinking demand of karaj city is significantly high that is partly provided by pumping from groundwater three observation wells as the indicator of groundwater level fluctuations of the region were selected within the area the karaj plain region and the location of observation wells is illustrated in fig 3 the shah abbasi tarbiat moallem and mehr shahr wells in the figure are showed as 1 2 and 3 respectively the monthly precipitation and evaporation of the same time scale were selected as the affecting parameters on groundwater level the monthly time period of 2002 2008 is used in this study precipitation pan evaporation and groundwater level time series were obtained from regional water authority of alborz province www albrw ir following araghinejad 2013 train validation and test datasets were split chronologically using 70 15 and 15 percent respectively months 1 59 considered as the training dataset months 60 71 considered as the validation dataset and finally months 72 83 was chosen as the test dataset the same datasets with the same splitting ratios for testing were used by fallah mehdipour et al 2013 in the case study 2 5 model structure one of the most important steps in developing a satisfactory simulation and forecasting model is model structure formation and the selection of input variables the characteristics of groundwater level cannot be accurately simulated and forecast when the number of input variables is too small similarly the number of input variables being too big leads to overfitting xing et al 2016 different methods for selecting input variables have been employed so far cross correlation is used by nayak et al 2006 and yoon et al 2011 principal component analysis pca and gamma test were used by noori et al 2010b and noori et al 2011 to determine the most important input variables fallah mehdipour et al 2014 xing et al 2016 and dezfooli et al 2018 among many others used default user defined models singular value decomposition svd and stepwise regression were employed to determine model structure by chitsaz et al 2016 and ghavidel and montaseri 2014 respectively in the current study four different model structures listed in table 1 were proposed following beven and young 2013 guide models 1 and 2 are forecasting models and models 3 and 4 are simulation models where h t j groundwater level of jth well at time step of t j

considering groundwater precipitation and evaporation data model 4 2 6 measures of accuracy the performance of the models in training validation and testing data sets are evaluated by the root mean square error rmse the correlation coefficient r 2 and the efficiency coefficient ns which are defined in eq 13 15 similar measures of accuracy have been used in previous studies inter alia nash and sutcliffe 1970 araghinejad et al 2018 wagh et al 2018 and aliyari et al 2019 13 r m s e 1 t t 1 t y t y ˆ t 2 14 r 2 1 t 1 t y t y 2 y ˆ t y 2 t 1 t y t y 2 t 1 t y ˆ t y 2 15 n s 1 t 1 t y t y ˆ t 2 t 1 t y t y 2 in which y t observed data y ˆ t the estimated calculated data y the average of estimated data and y the average of observed data the rmse represents the mean error of the model therefore small rmse value indicates more accuracy the r 2 represents how well the estimated groundwater level correlates with observed data the ns values range from to 1 ns 1 corresponds to a perfect match between estimated and observed data ns 0 shows that the performance of the model is the same as the mean value of observed data and n s 0 means that the mean observed value is a better estimation than model output therefore if n s 0 occurs it means that the model performance is unacceptable the ns values equal to zero is often used as a benchmark to distinguish acceptable and unacceptable models detail discussion on using ns 0 as a benchmark for measuring the accuracy of hydrological models can be found in gupta et al 2009 and knoben et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 isa lssvr and ga lssvr results the values of the lsssvr parameters were obtained using the isa and the ga the σ values range from 9 well 1 model 1 to 925 well 3 model 2 and the values of γ range from 20 well 1 model 1 to 823 well 3 model 4 optimized by the isa the measures of accuracy of training datasets are presented in table 2 also results obtained by anfis and gp which are presented by fallah mehdipour et al 2013 are mentioned in the table for comparison purposes as fallah mehdipour et al 2013 studied the same case study model structure testing splitting ratio criteria dataset and duration the results are comparable with each other the anfis used here maps the inputs to the outputs using both fuzzy if then rules and stipulation pairing of inputs and outputs sugeno first order fuzzy model was used in fuzzy system and the learning algorithm is a hybrid algorithm similar to those of noori et al 2010a which combines gradient descent and the method of least squares details can be found in fallah mehdipour et al 2013 the measures of accuracy of testing datasets are presented in table 3 according to the ns criterion the ga lssvr produces acceptable results for wells and models except models 2 and 4 in well number 3 in comparison to the anfis results the ga lssvr is a more accurate simulation and forecasting tool but it falls behind the isa lssvr and the gp the reason is that the isa is a more robust optimization algorithm than the ga therefore it can tune the lssvr parameters with more accuracy this statement is in line with the results of gandomi 2014 and moravej and hosseini moghari 2016 which showed the superiority of the isa over the ga also the ga lssvr results are less accurate in models 2 and 4 when precipitation and evaporation are considered in simulation and forecasting this is not the case when the lssvr parameters were tuned by the isa the superiority of the isa over the ga makes this difference the results of the isa lssvr indicate that the isa can tune the lssvr parameters correctly as the calculated ns values are in an acceptable range the isa lssvr produces better results than the ga lssvr and the anfis in all wells and models also the isa lssvr results are more accurate than the gp outputs in wells 1 and 3 as the ns values are higher but in the well number 2 the gp and the isa lssvr outputs are almost the same results of the isa lssvr for testing datasets are presented in fig 4 the 95 confidence intervals are calculated based on sidak corrections and results based on distributions of maxima and up crossing theory detailed can be found in nordin and rosbjerg 1970 and de brabanter et al 2010 fig 4 shows that considering precipitation and evaporation intensifies the uncertainty and leads to wider confidence intervals i e wider confidence intervals associated with models 2 and 4 with regards to tables 2 and 3 and fig 4 the isa lssvr with considered models structure can successfully simulate and forecasts groundwater level in karaj plain with high accuracy and efficiency the increased uncertainty by introducing precipitation and evaporation is linked to more number of inputs for example the wide confidence interval range was evident in model 4 which has 9 input variables in which four of them are linked to precipitation and evaporation an important comparison between the isa lssvr and the gp results is that the gp accuracy increases when precipitation and evaporation are considered in the model structure but the most accurate results of the isa lssvr were obtained without considering precipitation and evaporation for wells 1 and 3 one explanation is that in these cases groundwater is more affected by groundwater flows rather than surface infiltration or evaporation the same conclusion was made by fallah mehdipour et al 2013 for the study area another explanation is that precipitation and evaporation impacts can be seen in groundwater level especially when previous time steps of groundwater level time series are considered it has been shown that isa lssvr can capture these impacts and feeding the model with precipitation and evaporation data does not increase the model accuracy it should keep in mind that the accuracy achieved with isa lssvr is very high on the other hand gp is unable to capture these impacts and needs precipitation and evaporation time series as an exogenous input the third plausible explanation on why the results show groundwater level is not as sensitive to precipitation and evaporation as expected is the urban context of the aquifer previous studies have shown that increased impervious surfaces caused by urban development can reduce groundwater recharge in unconfined aquifers renouf et al 2019 whereas leaky urban water infrastructure can contribute to groundwater recharge lerner 2002 tubau et al 2017 factoring urban context and data driven methods used in this study indicate that the recharge is not primarily due to precipitation as the precipitation drains through urban drainage pipes with a lack of leakage data it is difficult to test this hypothesis now but could be a direction for future research the results showed that different methods might require different sets of input datasets to be able to provide the same modelling accuracy for example isa lssvr could accurately simulate and forecast groundwater level with less data requirements e g compare model 3 with model 4 results 3 2 the sensitivity analysis of the isa and the ga parameters the meta heuristic algorithm parameters affect the simulation and forecasting accuracy when an optimization algorithm links with the lssvr method in order to evaluate this effect elitism crossover and mutation rate of the ga were selected in the range of 0 2 0 5 0 9 and 0 01 0 1 respectively then 45 different runs with different sets of parameters were executed considering well 1 model 1 data the boxplots of the ns rmse and r 2 of test datasets are presented in fig 5 the isa parameter is tuned automatically so it is not a source of sensitivity but 45 different runs were employed for the comparison with the ga results and to show the influence of initial random location of elements fixed function evaluations of 500 were considered for both the isa and the ga the boxplots of the isa lssvr in fig 5 shows some lines rather than boxes because the isa parameter is tuned automatically so it is not a source of sensitivity therefore the coefficients of variation of different runs of the isa lssvr are very low 0 001 the reason that the coefficients of variation are not absolute zero is that the isa assumes initial random elements location and random variables for exploring the feasible space as a result the outputs of different runs may vary slightly as it can be seen in fig 5 this variation is negligible many studies indicate that the effect of random selection of initial population and exploration space is negligible in meta heuristic algorithms bozorg haddad et al 2015 hosseini moghari et al 2015 moravej 2017 2018 wardlaw and sharif 1999 4 conclusion in the current study the isa was introduced to optimize the lssvr parameters forming a new method for groundwater level simulation and forecast the result is compared with other data driven methods i e ga lssvr gp and anfis the comparison showed that the isa lssvr improves the simulation results of ga lssvr by 71 8 27 2 and 12 4 percent in terms of ns rmse and r 2 similar improvements for forecast were reported to be 62 7 24 8 and 12 3 percent for ns rmse and r 2 the results also highlighted isa lssvr is more accurate compared to gp negative ns values were reported for almost all of the wells and models by anfis indicating anfis ability for simulation and forecast groundwater level in the case study was unacceptable and unsatisfactory the advantages of the lssvr over anfis arise from the structural risk minimization in lssvr compared to the empirical risk minimization in anfis empirical risk minimization can cause the solution to be captured in a local minimum and cause over fitting of the results which was observed in this study but structural risk minimization minimizes the empirical error and model complexity simultaneously which theoretically can improve the generalization ability of the lssvr for regression problems this conclusion can be seen by comparing the results of lssvr and anfis considering precipitation and evaporation in the model structure did not necessarily improve the accuracy but complexes the simulation and forecasting therefore precipitation and evaporation acted as an extra source of uncertainty this observation motivated a hypothesis that groundwater level in the case study is affected by groundwater flow recharge due to leaky urban water infrastructure and reduced recharge from precipitation due to impervious surfaces preprocessing methods could be used to elicit the most important features and for input dimension reduction wavelet analysis empirical mode decomposition principal component analysis or singular value decomposition can be used for feature selection and dimension reduction to increase accuracy and reduce the complexity of the isa lssvr for groundwater level simulation and forecasting in future studies sensitivity analysis on the accuracy of the ga lssvr results indicates that the ns rmse and r 2 criteria are sensitive to the ga parameters on the other hand the isa parameter tuned automatically using a simple linear equation therefore the random initial elements location is the only sensitivity source in the isa low coefficient of variation of the ns rmse and r 2 criteria reported being 0 001 0 003 and 7 10 6 respectively the initial element location uncertainty can be eliminated using chaos theory instead of random selection in future studies with the sustainable use of groundwater resources being threatened in iran alipour et al 2018 there is a growing need for methods to simulate monitor and forecast the groundwater level with limited required data this study showed that isa lssvr gp and ga lssvr are able to simulate and forecasting groundwater level in the case study ranked from the highest accuracy to the lowest however due to efficiency and independency of isa lssvr to initial parameter selection isa lssvr is suggested for groundwater modeling of the area in conclusion isa lssvr is capable of in situ in groundwater level simulation and forecast where limited data is available declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowlegement no financial support is needed to be acknowledged 
12088,least square support vector regression lssvr is a powerful data driven method for simulation and forecasting with two parameters to tune in this study these parameters were automatically tuned using the interior search algorithm isa and genetic algorithm ga the main purpose is in situ simulation and forecast of monthly groundwater level in karaj plain iran using historical groundwater level precipitation and evaporation data the results of the interior search algorithm least support vector regression isa lssvr and genetic algorithm least support vector regression ga lssvr compared with genetic programming gp and adaptive neural fuzzy inference system anfis based on average nash sutcliffe criterion the results revealed that the isa lssvr improves the simulation and forecasting accuracy compared to other methods also the results of the different model structure selection indicate that including precipitation and evaporation does not necessarily improve simulation and forecasting accuracy but it would increase uncertainty this increase suggests that groundwater level in the case study is affected by groundwater flow recharge from leaky urban water infrastructure and reduced recharge from precipitation due to impervious surfaces in urban areas rather than being solely governed by precipitation and evaporation finally a sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the impacts of optimization algorithm parameters on the simulation and forecasting accuracy the results indicate high and low sensitivity associated with ga and isa respectively in conclusion isa lssvr was suggested as the best model due to computational efficiency low sensitivity to its parameters and high accuracy compared to other methods graphical abstract image 1 keywords data driven methods genetic algorithm optimization karaj aquifer sensitivity analysis support vector machines 1 introduction with the increase of computational capability of computers the application of data driven methods in groundwater level simulation and forecasting has been increased artificial neural network ann adaptive neural fuzzy inference system anfis genetic programming gp and support vector regression svr can be mentioned as some of these methods several studies reported the use of ann coppola et al 2003 maier and dandy 2000 wunsch et al 2018 anfis gong et al 2016 moosavi et al 2013 shiri and kişi 2011 and gp fallah mehdipour et al 2013 2014 shiri et al 2013 for groundwater level simulation and forecasting although these methods provide some degree of flexibility and accuracy in groundwater modelling some demerits have been reported high uncertainty associated with ann was reported by yoon et al 2011 for groundwater level forecasting in a coastal aquifer over fitting of anfis was reported by fallah mehdipour et al 2013 in karaj plain and high computational demand to find solutions was stated as a major disadvantage of gp by meier et al 2013 the svr method first presented by vapnik 1995 is a relatively new data driven method in hydrology the svr has been applied to forecast groundwater level liu et al 2009 used a least square support vector regression lssvr based on chaos dynamic and a radial basis function rbf as the kernel to forecast groundwater level behzad et al 2010 modeled groundwater level under different pumping and weather conditions by ann and svr methods they used the rbf kernel and identified svr parameters by grid search gs svr the results indicated that the svr especially when the data is insufficient is more accurate and generalized in comparison to ann yoon et al 2011 compared ann and svr methods in groundwater level simulation in a coastal aquifer the results illustrated that the average error in svr method was lower than those in ann method also uncertainty analysis showed lower uncertainty for svr method shiri et al 2013 made a comparison between the ann anfis gp svr and autoregressive moving average arma methods for groundwater level forecasting the results showed that the gp has the highest capability to forecast groundwater level up to 7 days beyond the recorded data they chose rbf kernel and the svr parameters were tuned by trial and error none of these studies dealt with the urban aquifers the recharge of unconfined aquifers in urban areas is complex due to the impact of impervious surface as a result of urban development renouf et al 2019 and urbanization in general salvadore et al 2015 for example leakage from urban water infrastructure in this case the link between groundwater recharge and meteorological variables e g precipitation temperature etc might not be straightforward and linear data driven methods has potential to be used in this context previous studies showed that the svr results accuracy largely depends on tuning its parameters the svr theory doesn t provide any specific methodology for parameter selection su et al 2014 trial and error have been performed in previous studies behzad et al 2010 bhagwat and maity 2013 yoon et al 2011 trial and error approach is a time consuming process and greatly affects the svr results accuracy achieving a high accuracy with trial and error approach is computationally expensive because the model needs to be evaluated at various points within the grid for each parameter meta heuristic optimization algorithms can be used to overcome this limitation raghavendra and deka 2015 the meta heuristic optimization algorithms were successfully applied in many water resources problems bozorg haddad et al 2015 fayaz et al 2020 hosseini moghari et al 2015 2017 and their strength and weaknesses have been reviewed maier et al 2014 moravej 2017 2018 sörensen 2015 some meta heuristic optimization algorithms were employed to find svr parameters genetic algorithm ga was employed to choose the svr parameters ga svr to forecast monthly reservoir storage su et al 2014 monthly streamflow kalteh 2015 water quality parameters in rivers bozorg haddad et al 2017 soleimani et al 2016 daily reference evapotranspiration yin et al 2017 and water temperature quan et al 2020 bat algorithm particle swarm optimization pso and artificial bee colony were coupled with svr for streamflow forecasting xing et al 2016 river stage forecasting seo et al 2016 the results indicate that pso svr and abc svr provided better results compared to gs svr and ga svr similar studies in groundwater level simulation and forecasting is missing in addition all meta heuristics algorithms used for tuning the svr parameters suffer from having two or more parameters to tune themselves the sensitivity of the meta heuristic algorithms was reported in previous studies moravej 2017 2018 interior search algorithm isa is a new evolutionary algorithm which overcomes this limitation isa is proposed by gandomi 2014 showing its superiority over other optimization algorithms in a wide range of problems moravej and hosseini moghari 2016 tuned the isa parameter automatically using a linear equation as a function of optimization iteration therefore the isa algorithm potentially provides more reliability compared to other meta heuristic algorithms they employed the isa to solve three reservoir operation problems i e karun 4 four reservoir and ten reservoir operation problems they compared the results of the isa with other meta heuristic algorithms such as honey bee mating optimization hbmo water cycle algorithm wca biogeography based optimization bbo imperial competition algorithm ica cuckoo optimization algorithm coa ant colony optimization aco and bat algorithm from previous studies the results indicate that the isa outperform those algorithms in accuracy reliability and fast convergence i e efficiency groundwater is a vital source for municipal industrial and agricultural usages in karaj city iran supporting socio economic activities of more than 2 million people therefore developing a reliable tool for simulating and forecasting water level is of interest in this region in the current study the isa was employed to automatically tune the lssvr isa lssvr parameters for groundwater level simulation and forecasting in karaj plain the aim is to evaluate the capability of the proposed method in groundwater level simulation and forecast to tackle this 12 different model structures were considered and the result of isa lssvr in two separate categories of simulation and forecast were compared with ga coupled with lssvr ga lssvr gp and anfis 2 material and methods 2 1 the lssvr the lssvr method was developed by suykens et al 2002 it is a modified version of the original method which was introduced by vapnik 1995 the lssvr provides a computational advantage over the regular svr via converting a quadratic programming problem into a set of linear equations kalteh 2015 the main advantage of this conversion is mentioned as decrease in the computational complexity and cost adnan et al 2017 raghavendra deka 2015 therefore lssvr is used in this study over other original svr and its variants consider a given time series set of t dataset x t y t t 1 2 3 t where x t ℜ d is the tth input dataset including d variables and y t ℜ is the tth output data a non linear regression function is expressed by eq 1 1 y x ω ϕ x b where ω transposed form of the weight matrix and φ a nonlinear

variables su et al 2014 in addition it has fewer numerical restrictions and a smaller number of parameters compared with other kernel functions su et al 2014 7 k x x t e x x t 2 σ 2 where σ is the parameter of the rbf fig 1 shows an illustration of lssvr the selection of the parameters σ and γ highly affect the accuracy of this method here the isa is used to obtain the optimal values of these parameters 2 2 the isa isa is developed by gandomi 2014 the concept of the algorithm can be found in gandomi 2014 and moravej and hosseini moghari 2016 the isa procedure is summarized as follows in this algorithm solutions are called elements first the locations of elements and their fitness values σ and γ are determined between the lower lb and upper bounds ub the objective function is defined in the isa lssvr section the fittest element in kth iteration is named as x g b k all other elements are classified into either composition or mirror groups this classification is being done in a random manner using α as a threshold value and a random variable 0 r 1 1 in a way that all elements with α r 1 go to the composition group while others are being assigned into the mirror group tuning the α is of significance to obtain a balance between diversification and intensification gandomi 2014 to obtain the global best the random walk equation eq 8 is used to modify x g b k for local search around the global best 8 x g b k x g b k 1 r n λ where λ and rn are scale factor equal to 0 01 u b l b and vector of normally distributed random numbers equation 9 is used to randomly change the elements in the composition group r2 random value between 0 and 1 by changing the upper and lower bounds 9 x i k l b k u b k l b k r 2 for the elements of the mirror group eq 10 is used to modify the elements for each iteration using r3 a random value between 0 and 1 as follow 10 x m i k r 3 x i k 1 1 r 3 x g b k the location of the image or virtual location of the element is dependent on the mirror s location as 11 x i k 2 x m i k x i k 1 after finding the fitness values the following expression is used to update the each location for a minimization problem 12 x i k x i k f x i k f x i k 1 x i k 1 o t h e r w i s e the isa flowchart can be seen in moravej and hosseini moghari 2016 2 2 1 calculating α following moravej and hosseini moghari 2016 the α 0 1 is selected and it gradually goes up to 0 9 as optimization iteration lead to maximum iteration this approach is found as an efficient way to tune α moravej and hosseini moghari 2016 the lower value of α at the beginning of optimization encourages composition part of the isa optimization which is an effective exploration tool when the value of α is drifted to 0 9 by approaching the maximum iteration the optimization procedure encourages exploitation at the end of iterations by switching to mirror search gandomi and roke 2014 2 3 the isa lssvr the flowchart of isa lssvr algorithm is shown in fig 2 the content of the dotted box in fig 3 describes the procedure for determining the optimal parameters σ and γ the iteration number in optimization process starts from zero i 0 then the initial elements locations are determined using real random numbers three datasets of training validation and testing were defined training dataset is used to train lssvr in a way that the ns value in validation phase is maximized the reason was that the ns was objective function in the current study and it was calculated for the validation data set the validation error normally decreases during the initial phase of training as does the training set error however when the network begins to overfit the data the error on the validation set typically begins to rise araghinejad 2013 this selection aims to assure that the risk of overfitting is minimal finally the testing dataset is used to provide an unbiased evaluation of the final model and it is used to make a judgment on the model accuracy the optimization stops when either the maximum value of the ns value ns 1 see section 2 6 or 500 function evaluations are reached number of function evaluations is the number of times the objective function is calculated during the optimization process typically function evaluations equal to multiplying the number of iteration by the population size however some optimization algorithms calculate the objective function multiple times for each iteration thus the number of function evaluations in those algorithms becomes higher with the same number of iteration and population size therefore we need to compare the performance of optimization algorithms on number of function evaluations rather than number of iteration and population size more information on how ga can automatically tune the svr parameters can be found in su et al 2014 and kalteh 2015 2 4 study area the case study is located in the northwest of karaj plain in iran the aquifer is an unconfined quaternary alluvial aquifer with deposits of sand gravel clay chitsazan et al 2017 the results of the geophysical studies in this area show that the thickness of alluvium in the northern areas is about 50 100 m chitsazan et al 2017 the drinking demand of karaj city is significantly high that is partly provided by pumping from groundwater three observation wells as the indicator of groundwater level fluctuations of the region were selected within the area the karaj plain region and the location of observation wells is illustrated in fig 3 the shah abbasi tarbiat moallem and mehr shahr wells in the figure are showed as 1 2 and 3 respectively the monthly precipitation and evaporation of the same time scale were selected as the affecting parameters on groundwater level the monthly time period of 2002 2008 is used in this study precipitation pan evaporation and groundwater level time series were obtained from regional water authority of alborz province www albrw ir following araghinejad 2013 train validation and test datasets were split chronologically using 70 15 and 15 percent respectively months 1 59 considered as the training dataset months 60 71 considered as the validation dataset and finally months 72 83 was chosen as the test dataset the same datasets with the same splitting ratios for testing were used by fallah mehdipour et al 2013 in the case study 2 5 model structure one of the most important steps in developing a satisfactory simulation and forecasting model is model structure formation and the selection of input variables the characteristics of groundwater level cannot be accurately simulated and forecast when the number of input variables is too small similarly the number of input variables being too big leads to overfitting xing et al 2016 different methods for selecting input variables have been employed so far cross correlation is used by nayak et al 2006 and yoon et al 2011 principal component analysis pca and gamma test were used by noori et al 2010b and noori et al 2011 to determine the most important input variables fallah mehdipour et al 2014 xing et al 2016 and dezfooli et al 2018 among many others used default user defined models singular value decomposition svd and stepwise regression were employed to determine model structure by chitsaz et al 2016 and ghavidel and montaseri 2014 respectively in the current study four different model structures listed in table 1 were proposed following beven and young 2013 guide models 1 and 2 are forecasting models and models 3 and 4 are simulation models where h t j groundwater level of jth well at time step of t j

considering groundwater precipitation and evaporation data model 4 2 6 measures of accuracy the performance of the models in training validation and testing data sets are evaluated by the root mean square error rmse the correlation coefficient r 2 and the efficiency coefficient ns which are defined in eq 13 15 similar measures of accuracy have been used in previous studies inter alia nash and sutcliffe 1970 araghinejad et al 2018 wagh et al 2018 and aliyari et al 2019 13 r m s e 1 t t 1 t y t y ˆ t 2 14 r 2 1 t 1 t y t y 2 y ˆ t y 2 t 1 t y t y 2 t 1 t y ˆ t y 2 15 n s 1 t 1 t y t y ˆ t 2 t 1 t y t y 2 in which y t observed data y ˆ t the estimated calculated data y the average of estimated data and y the average of observed data the rmse represents the mean error of the model therefore small rmse value indicates more accuracy the r 2 represents how well the estimated groundwater level correlates with observed data the ns values range from to 1 ns 1 corresponds to a perfect match between estimated and observed data ns 0 shows that the performance of the model is the same as the mean value of observed data and n s 0 means that the mean observed value is a better estimation than model output therefore if n s 0 occurs it means that the model performance is unacceptable the ns values equal to zero is often used as a benchmark to distinguish acceptable and unacceptable models detail discussion on using ns 0 as a benchmark for measuring the accuracy of hydrological models can be found in gupta et al 2009 and knoben et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 isa lssvr and ga lssvr results the values of the lsssvr parameters were obtained using the isa and the ga the σ values range from 9 well 1 model 1 to 925 well 3 model 2 and the values of γ range from 20 well 1 model 1 to 823 well 3 model 4 optimized by the isa the measures of accuracy of training datasets are presented in table 2 also results obtained by anfis and gp which are presented by fallah mehdipour et al 2013 are mentioned in the table for comparison purposes as fallah mehdipour et al 2013 studied the same case study model structure testing splitting ratio criteria dataset and duration the results are comparable with each other the anfis used here maps the inputs to the outputs using both fuzzy if then rules and stipulation pairing of inputs and outputs sugeno first order fuzzy model was used in fuzzy system and the learning algorithm is a hybrid algorithm similar to those of noori et al 2010a which combines gradient descent and the method of least squares details can be found in fallah mehdipour et al 2013 the measures of accuracy of testing datasets are presented in table 3 according to the ns criterion the ga lssvr produces acceptable results for wells and models except models 2 and 4 in well number 3 in comparison to the anfis results the ga lssvr is a more accurate simulation and forecasting tool but it falls behind the isa lssvr and the gp the reason is that the isa is a more robust optimization algorithm than the ga therefore it can tune the lssvr parameters with more accuracy this statement is in line with the results of gandomi 2014 and moravej and hosseini moghari 2016 which showed the superiority of the isa over the ga also the ga lssvr results are less accurate in models 2 and 4 when precipitation and evaporation are considered in simulation and forecasting this is not the case when the lssvr parameters were tuned by the isa the superiority of the isa over the ga makes this difference the results of the isa lssvr indicate that the isa can tune the lssvr parameters correctly as the calculated ns values are in an acceptable range the isa lssvr produces better results than the ga lssvr and the anfis in all wells and models also the isa lssvr results are more accurate than the gp outputs in wells 1 and 3 as the ns values are higher but in the well number 2 the gp and the isa lssvr outputs are almost the same results of the isa lssvr for testing datasets are presented in fig 4 the 95 confidence intervals are calculated based on sidak corrections and results based on distributions of maxima and up crossing theory detailed can be found in nordin and rosbjerg 1970 and de brabanter et al 2010 fig 4 shows that considering precipitation and evaporation intensifies the uncertainty and leads to wider confidence intervals i e wider confidence intervals associated with models 2 and 4 with regards to tables 2 and 3 and fig 4 the isa lssvr with considered models structure can successfully simulate and forecasts groundwater level in karaj plain with high accuracy and efficiency the increased uncertainty by introducing precipitation and evaporation is linked to more number of inputs for example the wide confidence interval range was evident in model 4 which has 9 input variables in which four of them are linked to precipitation and evaporation an important comparison between the isa lssvr and the gp results is that the gp accuracy increases when precipitation and evaporation are considered in the model structure but the most accurate results of the isa lssvr were obtained without considering precipitation and evaporation for wells 1 and 3 one explanation is that in these cases groundwater is more affected by groundwater flows rather than surface infiltration or evaporation the same conclusion was made by fallah mehdipour et al 2013 for the study area another explanation is that precipitation and evaporation impacts can be seen in groundwater level especially when previous time steps of groundwater level time series are considered it has been shown that isa lssvr can capture these impacts and feeding the model with precipitation and evaporation data does not increase the model accuracy it should keep in mind that the accuracy achieved with isa lssvr is very high on the other hand gp is unable to capture these impacts and needs precipitation and evaporation time series as an exogenous input the third plausible explanation on why the results show groundwater level is not as sensitive to precipitation and evaporation as expected is the urban context of the aquifer previous studies have shown that increased impervious surfaces caused by urban development can reduce groundwater recharge in unconfined aquifers renouf et al 2019 whereas leaky urban water infrastructure can contribute to groundwater recharge lerner 2002 tubau et al 2017 factoring urban context and data driven methods used in this study indicate that the recharge is not primarily due to precipitation as the precipitation drains through urban drainage pipes with a lack of leakage data it is difficult to test this hypothesis now but could be a direction for future research the results showed that different methods might require different sets of input datasets to be able to provide the same modelling accuracy for example isa lssvr could accurately simulate and forecast groundwater level with less data requirements e g compare model 3 with model 4 results 3 2 the sensitivity analysis of the isa and the ga parameters the meta heuristic algorithm parameters affect the simulation and forecasting accuracy when an optimization algorithm links with the lssvr method in order to evaluate this effect elitism crossover and mutation rate of the ga were selected in the range of 0 2 0 5 0 9 and 0 01 0 1 respectively then 45 different runs with different sets of parameters were executed considering well 1 model 1 data the boxplots of the ns rmse and r 2 of test datasets are presented in fig 5 the isa parameter is tuned automatically so it is not a source of sensitivity but 45 different runs were employed for the comparison with the ga results and to show the influence of initial random location of elements fixed function evaluations of 500 were considered for both the isa and the ga the boxplots of the isa lssvr in fig 5 shows some lines rather than boxes because the isa parameter is tuned automatically so it is not a source of sensitivity therefore the coefficients of variation of different runs of the isa lssvr are very low 0 001 the reason that the coefficients of variation are not absolute zero is that the isa assumes initial random elements location and random variables for exploring the feasible space as a result the outputs of different runs may vary slightly as it can be seen in fig 5 this variation is negligible many studies indicate that the effect of random selection of initial population and exploration space is negligible in meta heuristic algorithms bozorg haddad et al 2015 hosseini moghari et al 2015 moravej 2017 2018 wardlaw and sharif 1999 4 conclusion in the current study the isa was introduced to optimize the lssvr parameters forming a new method for groundwater level simulation and forecast the result is compared with other data driven methods i e ga lssvr gp and anfis the comparison showed that the isa lssvr improves the simulation results of ga lssvr by 71 8 27 2 and 12 4 percent in terms of ns rmse and r 2 similar improvements for forecast were reported to be 62 7 24 8 and 12 3 percent for ns rmse and r 2 the results also highlighted isa lssvr is more accurate compared to gp negative ns values were reported for almost all of the wells and models by anfis indicating anfis ability for simulation and forecast groundwater level in the case study was unacceptable and unsatisfactory the advantages of the lssvr over anfis arise from the structural risk minimization in lssvr compared to the empirical risk minimization in anfis empirical risk minimization can cause the solution to be captured in a local minimum and cause over fitting of the results which was observed in this study but structural risk minimization minimizes the empirical error and model complexity simultaneously which theoretically can improve the generalization ability of the lssvr for regression problems this conclusion can be seen by comparing the results of lssvr and anfis considering precipitation and evaporation in the model structure did not necessarily improve the accuracy but complexes the simulation and forecasting therefore precipitation and evaporation acted as an extra source of uncertainty this observation motivated a hypothesis that groundwater level in the case study is affected by groundwater flow recharge due to leaky urban water infrastructure and reduced recharge from precipitation due to impervious surfaces preprocessing methods could be used to elicit the most important features and for input dimension reduction wavelet analysis empirical mode decomposition principal component analysis or singular value decomposition can be used for feature selection and dimension reduction to increase accuracy and reduce the complexity of the isa lssvr for groundwater level simulation and forecasting in future studies sensitivity analysis on the accuracy of the ga lssvr results indicates that the ns rmse and r 2 criteria are sensitive to the ga parameters on the other hand the isa parameter tuned automatically using a simple linear equation therefore the random initial elements location is the only sensitivity source in the isa low coefficient of variation of the ns rmse and r 2 criteria reported being 0 001 0 003 and 7 10 6 respectively the initial element location uncertainty can be eliminated using chaos theory instead of random selection in future studies with the sustainable use of groundwater resources being threatened in iran alipour et al 2018 there is a growing need for methods to simulate monitor and forecast the groundwater level with limited required data this study showed that isa lssvr gp and ga lssvr are able to simulate and forecasting groundwater level in the case study ranked from the highest accuracy to the lowest however due to efficiency and independency of isa lssvr to initial parameter selection isa lssvr is suggested for groundwater modeling of the area in conclusion isa lssvr is capable of in situ in groundwater level simulation and forecast where limited data is available declaration of competing interest the

12089,groundwater based irrigation is one of the key factors for rapid agricultural development in india therefore understanding the sustainability of irrigation water management is utmost important for agriculture this study investigated the sustainability of groundwater based irrigation by identifying recent 1996 2017 trend in groundwater depth using mann kendall mk test or modified mk and sen s slope analysis this study also explored the relationships of groundwater depth with rainfall and irrigated areas in lower ganga river basin in india with an area 195 601 km2 results showed that almost 81 78 66 22 74 38 and 66 79 wells for pre monsoon monsoon post monsoon and winter seasons respectively showed increasing trends in groundwater depth the rapid increasing trend slope 8 95 104 46 cm year in monsoon season indicates shallow groundwater resource depletion and groundwater abstraction exceeds the groundwater recharge moreover dry seasons increasing trends infer that shallow pumps will not functioning in future as a result irrigation cost will increase although irrigated areas remain almost same 1997 2014 decreasing rainfall along with abstraction of groundwater during dry season is primarily identified as main driving force for groundwater depletion further study is necessary to characterize the groundwater depletion planned water management is urgent for ensuring sustainable irrigation water management graphical abstract image 1 keywords agricultural water management groundwater depletion climate change lower ganga basin india 1 introduction water is one of the crucial natural resources for agricultural economic and environmental development rahman et al 2017 and rahman et al 2020a b however global groundwater resource has already affected by different types of problems such as rapid depletion park et al 2011 dalin et al 2017 large scale pollution and seawater intrusion gorelick and zheng 2015 global climate change has also affected the groundwater resources as well as hydrological cycle stagl et al 2014 groundwater dependent irrigation has significantly increased in developing countries such as india over the last half of the twenty century siebert et al 2010 india is the highest groundwater user in the globe and almost 250 billion m3 has withdrawn each year shah et al 2007 singh and singh 2002 groundwater is the single most sources of water for irrigation and about 65 irrigated water comes from groundwater siebert et al 2010 in india such huge withdrawal of groundwater by millions of independent farmers is called silent revolution llamas and martínez santos 2005 this withdrawal has largely occurred without any hydrological planning resulting high groundwater depletion in developing county like bangladesh ali et al 2012 rahman et al 2016 irrigated agriculture causes groundwater depletion however food security and rural livelihood in india depends on irrigated agriculture about 70 of the food grains come from irrigated agriculture asoka et al 2017 in india therefore sustainability of irrigation water management is utmost important for understanding food security as well as environmental and socio economic development under the changing climate although understanding the sustainability of water resources management is very important for developmental perspectives there is no particular approach that can deal with the problem harmancioglu et al 2013 there are several traditional approaches such as groundwater recharge safe yield and groundwater footprint for understanding sustainability gleeson et al 2012 harmancioglu et al 2013 rahman et al 2018a however these traditional approaches are not suitable for understanding sustainability especially under the changing climate gleeson et al 2012 balleau 2013 identifying the trend in groundwater storage changes derived from remote sensing observation data such as gravity recovery climate experiment grace has attracted attention for understanding global groundwater sustainability over the last few decades thomas et al 2017 studies rodell et al 2009 also reported the declining trend in groundwater storage in india based on grace data however identification of trend in observation data is limited in india asoka et al 2017 furthermore identifying trends in observation data in situ observation and characterizing the trends are necessary for preparing sustainable water resources management plans to cope with changing climate rahman et al 2016 2017b therefore the aim of this study was to develop a framework for assessing the sustainability of groundwater management for irrigation water management to fulfil the goal of this study we identified the trends in long term recent groundwater data trend was characterized by spatio temporal changes in rainfall and irrigated areas in lower ganga river basin lgrb in india to accomplish this study we used non parametric mann kendall mk mann 1945 kendall 1975 test or modified mk hamed and rao 1998 based on the properties of the observation data the slope of the changes was estimated by sen s estimator sen 1968 mk and mmk tests are the robust methods for identifying trends in hydro

of india it comprises four sub basins namely bhagirathi damodar gandak and sone due to the unavailability of groundwater data sone sub basin excluded from our study area the present study area extends from 21 36 30 n to 27 25 30 n latitudes and 83 47 30 e to 89 05 e longitudes having the geographical area of 195 601 km2 fig 1 the basin includes bihar jharkhand and west bengal states and covers 78 districts in eastern india and home to approximately 227 million peoples despite the presence of numbers of large rivers bhagirathi damodar gandak and sone most of the cultivators of this region are dependent on groundwater for agriculture especially for rabi crop cultivations boro rice is highly irrigated crops cultivated almost 52 14 2014 of the total cultivated area during november to may furthermore in recent years boro rice cultivation has been extensively increased in west bengal and bihar singh 2002 hence groundwater resource is highly exploited in the basin the study area divided into 9 principal aquifer systems alluvium aquifer of quaternary age occupied the maximum areas of the basin and covering the northern southern and eastern parts of the lgrb the depth of deep water level of alluvium is 2 40 mbgl whereas thickness of weathered zone is 2 1200 m cgwb 2020 likewise laterite spread over some pockets of eastern and western parts which has the moderate depth of groundwater level 5 20 mbgl the rest of the area of western part of the basin are occupied by bgc schist sandstone quartzite basalt granite and gneiss aquifer fig 2 2 2 data recent seasonal groundwater observation data 1996 2017 of more than thousands dug wells located in the lgrb were collected from india water resource information system portal http cgwb gov in gw data access html the locations of the analyzed dug wells are shown in fig 1 however data of many dug wells have long missing records this study discarded the dug wells with long missing records and analyzed the groundwater observation data of 527 dug wells for pre monsoon march to may monsoon june to september post monsoon october to november and winter december to february seasons we also analyzed the irrigated areas in west bengal bihar and jharkhand states data were collected from data gov portal in india https data gov in this study also analyzed the rainfall data for the period of 1980 2010

rainfall as well as in irrigated areas with the help of mk tests mann 1945 kendall 1975 and slope was estimated by sen s slope estimator sen 1968 these non parametric approaches are widely used for detecting trends in hydro meteorological data such as groundwater rahman et al 2016 rainfall tabari et al 2012 kamruzzaman et al 2018 das and bhattacharya 2018 das et al 2019 2020 since it is not necessary to test the distribution of the data and provide robust results than parametric approaches such as linear regression tabari et al 2012 nalley et al 2013 rahman et al 2018b the test statistic

water level depth with the help of mk test mmk test based on autocorrelation at lag 1 and sen s slope estimator was used for assessing the magnitude change 3 1 1 pre monsoon trend test results of pre monsoon season ground water level depth time series are presented in table 1 and fig 3 a the obtained results clearly indicated that groundwater depth in the most of the studied wells n 527 wells showed increasing trends 81 78 and rest of them showed decreasing 18 22 tendency during the period of 1996 2017 about half 46 87 of the wells showed significant increasing trends at different confidence intervals table 1 spatial distribution of z statistics of trend test result is shown in fig 3a the whole study area showed increasing trend in groundwater depth except some pocket areas which are distributed discretely over the study area fig 3a account of significant decreasing trend was only 3 80 table 1 most of the significant increasing trends were found in southern and central part of the lgrb sen s slope analysis revealed that groundwater depth increases on average at a rate of 10 97 cm year over the area similar to significant trend z statistics distribution the higher magnitude of changes 20 cm year were found in the central and southern part of the area fig 5a the magnitude of increasing trend for the major part of the area varied between 6 83 and 95 32 cm year the highest increasing rate 95 32 cm year was found for bamongola dug well located in malda district in west bengal and the highest decreasing rate sen q 70 77 cm year was also found in west bengal at kutubsahar dug well under malda district increasing trends in groundwater depth during pre monsoon adversely affects the agricultural productions especially boro rice which almost entirely depends on groundwater irrigation water requirement during this period is higher due to the higher temperature and evaporation tuinenburg et al 2012 small farmers rely on shallow pumps for irrigated their lands groundwater level may fluctuate below the suction mode of shallow pump in near future due to continuous increasing of groundwater depth and consequently cost of irrigation will increase due to scare shallow groundwater during this high water demand seasons 3 1 2 monsoon the trend analysis results of monsoon ground water depth also showed dominate increasing trends throughout the lgrb during 1996 2017 fig 3b more than half of the wells 62 22 n 527 showed increasing tendency and almost one third of the wells 28 65 showed a significant increasing trend at different confidence levels table 1 the obtained significant increasing trends were mostly found in south eastern and north western part of the lgrb the highest significant increasing trend 104 46 cm year of ground water depth was observed at kuli in murshidabad district of west bengal fig 5b the average rate of increasing of ground water depth obtained from sen slope was 7 63 cm year hence increasing depth of ground water during the rainy season infers that the amount of groundwater recharge of the area is not sufficient for regain the groundwater during this high water season recharge period in other words groundwater abstraction during the dry period is much higher than amount of groundwater recharge during rainy seasons at the same time the numbers of observed wells with significant declining trends were very low 7 6 table 1 sparsely distributed over the study area the highest significant decreasing trend 72 02 c m y e a r was observed in west bengal at bishnupur under the district of bankura fig 4 shows rapid increasing groundwater depth of two most vulnerable observed dug wells of the study area namely dhopagachi and rajgir respectively 3 1 3 post monsoon the spatial distribution of the results of z statistics trend and sen s slope of ground water level depths time series of post monsoon are presented in figs 3c and 5c which are more or less similar to the monsoon season in this period two third 74 38 n 527 of the wells showed positive trends in water level depth below the ground surface and approximately one third 32 06 of the wells showed significant positive trend at the confidence level of 99 95 and 90 respectively table 1 sen s slope analysis revealed that average groundwater depth increases at the rate of 6 76 cm year over the area the degree of increasing trend for the major part of the area varied between 0 01 and 104 44 cm year this may due to inadequate recharge of the wells in the monsoon season however significant positive trends are sparsely distributed over lgrb with maximum concentrated in the south eastern eastern and north western part fig 3c on the contrary a little portion 3 80 of the observation wells showed significant negative trend during 1996 2017 table 1 with the highest significant negative trend 64 17 cm year for bishnupur dug wells located in bankura district of west bengal 3 1 4 winter the spatiotemporal variation of ground water depth trend and their magnitude in the winter time series are presented in figs 3d and 5d the obtained results clearly revealed that groundwater depth of two third 66 79 of the dug wells showed increasing trends and 33 21 rest of the wells showed decreasing trend during 1996 2017 table 1 about one fourth 23 91 of the wells showed significant increasing tendency and only 9 12 wells showed significant decreasing tendency at different confidence levels table 1 most of the significant increasing trends were found in south eastern eastern western and central part of the lgrb and the magnitude of slopes were comparatively lower 0 01 75 78 cm year during this season with an average of 4 30 cm year for the study area the highest increasing 75 78 cm year trend was observed in west bengal at ramjibanpur dug wells under the district of paschim midnapore on the contrary significant decreasing trends were sparsely distributed in pockets over the lgrb fig 3d and the magnitude of trend were varied from 48 83 to 2 27 cm year fig 5d 3 2 trends in rainfall 3 2 1 annual trend the spatial distribution of z statistics and their magnitude of annual rainfall are presented in table 2 and fig 6 b c the results clearly indicated that rainfall pattern in most of the stations total stations n 71 showed decreasing trends 87 32 and rest of them showed increasing 12 68 tendency during the period of 1980 2010 about two third 64 78 of the stations showed significant decreasing tendency at different confidence level while the account for significant increasing trend was only 2 82 table 2 the spatial distribution of z statistics fig 6b shows that decreasing trends are dominating over the study area except the southern part and the northern part up to central part area shows significant decreasing trends and slope varied from 2 70 to 0 44 mm year on the other hand a significant increasing trend was found at south 24 parganas station during the study period magnitude of trend was 2 55 mm year bera 2017 also found highest increasing 4 99 mm year trend at south 24 parganas stations 3 2 2 seasonal trend trend analysis results of seasonal rainfall showed both increasing and decreasing trends throughout the lgrb during 1980 2010 the estimated value of z statistics were 0 80 1 96 0 89 and 0 19 for pre monsoon monsoon post monsoon and winter respectively although the other seasons showed insignificant trend monsoon season rainfall in the basin area is significant at 95 confidence level station wise analysis reveals that the trends of pre monsoon and post monsoon are dominated by insignificant increasing trend accounting for 52 and 50 70 respectively monsoon and winter season were dominated by significant decreasing 74 65 and insignificant decreasing 52 11 trends respectively table 2 the entire basin area showed an increasing trend in pre monsoon season rainfall except the extreme south eastern part fig 7 a monsoon trend map fig 7b shows similar spatial distribution of trends for annual rainfall insignificant increasing trends in post monsoon season rainfall were found throughout the basin except the northwestern part fig 7c whereas insignificant decreasing trend in winter season were observed over whole basin area except few pockets of northern and western part of the basin area fig 7d bera 2017 also identified significantly decreasing trend in pre monsoon and monsoon rainfall over ganga basin during 1901 2000 however the magnitude of rainfall trend in pre monsoon post monsoon and winter are very low fig 7 while in monsoon season the slope of trend is quite high 1 42 mm year 4 irrigated area there is no direct record of the amount of annual groundwater abstraction for the study area this study used the irrigated area to get idea about groundwater abstraction for boro rice irrigation fig 8 shows that there is no increasing trend in boro rice irrigated area during the period 1997 2014 however it showed a slow decreasing trend both in west bengal and bihar state these results suggest that the trends in boro rice irrigated area cannot alone be used for explanation of groundwater depth increase over the whole area our study area also covers another one state which is jharkhand however there is no long term precise record of the irrigated area like these two states fig 9 a and b show the district wise distribution of irrigated area in lgrb for the years 1997 and 2014 respectively fig 9c shows the changes in irrigated area in lgrb witnessed the comparatively more positive change at southern 17147 91 61481 00 ha and less in eastern central and western 0 01 17147 91 ha region rest of the basin area showed a negative change 69218 00 0 00 ha during the study period 5 conclusions this study documented the linkage of groundwater depletion with irrigated area and rainfall under the changing climate in lgrb area our study found that shallow groundwater resource in the area is rapidly declining as the depth of the groundwater rapidly increases during rainy season furthermore decreasing trends in rainfall dominated over the area and 64 78 n 71 had a significant decreasing trend during the period of 1980 2010 however the magnitude of change of rainfall was far lower 2 30 mm year than that of increasing rate of groundwater depth hence it can be inferred that groundwater recharge rate is far lower than the amount of groundwater abstraction during dry seasons winter pre monsoon and decreasing trend in rainfall fasten the groundwater depletion for example the rapid increasing groundwater level depth in winter and pre monsoon indicates more pumping during these seasons causing a larger number of observation wells to have a declining trend in these seasons as there are no significant trends in irrigated areas it can also infer that groundwater development occurs without considering proper hydrological planning water balance i e recharge versus abstraction the cultivation of boro paddy which is completely dependent upon the irrigation will face difficulties in near future hence advance irrigation water management techniques such as raised bed alternate drying and wetting need to promote for saving water as well as surface water irrigation area need to increase to minimize the stress on groundwater resource to achieve sustainability in groundwater resource water resource managers need to prepare

12089,groundwater based irrigation is one of the key factors for rapid agricultural development in india therefore understanding the sustainability of irrigation water management is utmost important for agriculture this study investigated the sustainability of groundwater based irrigation by identifying recent 1996 2017 trend in groundwater depth using mann kendall mk test or modified mk and sen s slope analysis this study also explored the relationships of groundwater depth with rainfall and irrigated areas in lower ganga river basin in india with an area 195 601 km2 results showed that almost 81 78 66 22 74 38 and 66 79 wells for pre monsoon monsoon post monsoon and winter seasons respectively showed increasing trends in groundwater depth the rapid increasing trend slope 8 95 104 46 cm year in monsoon season indicates shallow groundwater resource depletion and groundwater abstraction exceeds the groundwater recharge moreover dry seasons increasing trends infer that shallow pumps will not functioning in future as a result irrigation cost will increase although irrigated areas remain almost same 1997 2014 decreasing rainfall along with abstraction of groundwater during dry season is primarily identified as main driving force for groundwater depletion further study is necessary to characterize the groundwater depletion planned water management is urgent for ensuring sustainable irrigation water management graphical abstract image 1 keywords agricultural water management groundwater depletion climate change lower ganga basin india 1 introduction water is one of the crucial natural resources for agricultural economic and environmental development rahman et al 2017 and rahman et al 2020a b however global groundwater resource has already affected by different types of problems such as rapid depletion park et al 2011 dalin et al 2017 large scale pollution and seawater intrusion gorelick and zheng 2015 global climate change has also affected the groundwater resources as well as hydrological cycle stagl et al 2014 groundwater dependent irrigation has significantly increased in developing countries such as india over the last half of the twenty century siebert et al 2010 india is the highest groundwater user in the globe and almost 250 billion m3 has withdrawn each year shah et al 2007 singh and singh 2002 groundwater is the single most sources of water for irrigation and about 65 irrigated water comes from groundwater siebert et al 2010 in india such huge withdrawal of groundwater by millions of independent farmers is called silent revolution llamas and martínez santos 2005 this withdrawal has largely occurred without any hydrological planning resulting high groundwater depletion in developing county like bangladesh ali et al 2012 rahman et al 2016 irrigated agriculture causes groundwater depletion however food security and rural livelihood in india depends on irrigated agriculture about 70 of the food grains come from irrigated agriculture asoka et al 2017 in india therefore sustainability of irrigation water management is utmost important for understanding food security as well as environmental and socio economic development under the changing climate although understanding the sustainability of water resources management is very important for developmental perspectives there is no particular approach that can deal with the problem harmancioglu et al 2013 there are several traditional approaches such as groundwater recharge safe yield and groundwater footprint for understanding sustainability gleeson et al 2012 harmancioglu et al 2013 rahman et al 2018a however these traditional approaches are not suitable for understanding sustainability especially under the changing climate gleeson et al 2012 balleau 2013 identifying the trend in groundwater storage changes derived from remote sensing observation data such as gravity recovery climate experiment grace has attracted attention for understanding global groundwater sustainability over the last few decades thomas et al 2017 studies rodell et al 2009 also reported the declining trend in groundwater storage in india based on grace data however identification of trend in observation data is limited in india asoka et al 2017 furthermore identifying trends in observation data in situ observation and characterizing the trends are necessary for preparing sustainable water resources management plans to cope with changing climate rahman et al 2016 2017b therefore the aim of this study was to develop a framework for assessing the sustainability of groundwater management for irrigation water management to fulfil the goal of this study we identified the trends in long term recent groundwater data trend was characterized by spatio temporal changes in rainfall and irrigated areas in lower ganga river basin lgrb in india to accomplish this study we used non parametric mann kendall mk mann 1945 kendall 1975 test or modified mk hamed and rao 1998 based on the properties of the observation data the slope of the changes was estimated by sen s estimator sen 1968 mk and mmk tests are the robust methods for identifying trends in hydro meteorological variables and can be applied in missing data tabari et al 2012 nalley et al 2013 rahman et al 2018b 2 study area and methods 2 1 study area the lgrb is located in the northeastern part of india it comprises four sub basins namely bhagirathi damodar gandak and sone due to the unavailability of groundwater data sone sub basin excluded from our study area the present study area extends from 21 36 30 n to 27 25 30 n latitudes and 83 47 30 e to 89 05 e longitudes having the geographical area of 195 601 km2 fig 1 the basin includes bihar jharkhand and west bengal states and covers 78 districts in eastern india and home to approximately 227 million peoples despite the presence of numbers of large rivers bhagirathi damodar gandak and sone most of the cultivators of this region are dependent on groundwater for agriculture especially for rabi crop cultivations boro rice is highly irrigated crops cultivated almost 52 14 2014 of the total cultivated area during november to may furthermore in recent years boro rice cultivation has been extensively increased in west bengal and bihar singh 2002 hence groundwater resource is highly exploited in the basin the study area divided into 9 principal aquifer systems alluvium aquifer of quaternary age occupied the maximum areas of the basin and covering the northern southern and eastern parts of the lgrb the depth of deep water level of alluvium is 2 40 mbgl whereas thickness of weathered zone is 2 1200 m cgwb 2020 likewise laterite spread over some pockets of eastern and western parts which has the moderate depth of groundwater level 5 20 mbgl the rest of the area of western part of the basin are occupied by bgc schist sandstone quartzite basalt granite and gneiss aquifer fig 2 2 2 data recent seasonal groundwater observation data 1996 2017 of more than thousands dug wells located in the lgrb were collected from india water resource information system portal http cgwb gov in gw data access html the locations of the analyzed dug wells are shown in fig 1 however data of many dug wells have long missing records this study discarded the dug wells with long missing records and analyzed the groundwater observation data of 527 dug wells for pre monsoon march to may monsoon june to september post monsoon october to november and winter december to february seasons we also analyzed the irrigated areas in west bengal bihar and jharkhand states data were collected from data gov portal in india https data gov in this study also analyzed the rainfall data for the period of 1980 2010 rainfall data base was compiled from india water portal https www indiawaterportal org met data 2 3 methods this study detected the trends in hydro meteorological data i e groundwater depth and rainfall as well as in irrigated areas with the help of mk tests mann 1945 kendall 1975 and slope was estimated by sen s slope estimator sen 1968 these non parametric approaches are widely used for detecting trends in hydro meteorological data such as groundwater rahman et al 2016 rainfall tabari et al 2012 kamruzzaman et al 2018 das and bhattacharya 2018 das et al 2019 2020 since it is not necessary to test the distribution of the data and provide robust results than parametric approaches such as linear regression tabari et al 2012 nalley et al 2013 rahman et al 2018b the test statistic s of a time series x 1 x 2 x 3 and x n can be calculated using mk test as mann 1945 kendall 1975 1 s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n s i g n x j x k here n is the quantity of data points x j and x k denotes the data

kamruzzaman et al 2016 this study estimated the auto correlation at lag 1 to confirm about credibility of z statistics obtained from mk test if there were significant auto correlation in the data this study estimated test statistics z by mmk test hamed and rao 1998 the modified var s statistics can be estimated as hamed and rao 1998 5 v a r s n n 1 2 n 5 18 n n e here the correction factor n n e is adjusted to the auto correlated data as 6 n n e 1 2 n 3 3 n 2 2 n f 1 n 1 n f n f 1 n f 2 ρ e f ρ e f represents the autocorrelation function between ranks of observations and can be estimated as 7 ρ f 2 sin π 6 ρ e f sen s slope sen 1968 estimator was used to estimate the magnitude of change slope q the slope q can be obtained from n pairs of data as 8 q i x k x j k j i 1 2 n k j where x k and x j represent values of data at k j times and q i is the median slope respectively 3 results and discussions 3 1 trend in groundwater depth this study investigated the recent 1996 2017 trends in ground water level depth with the help of mk test mmk test based on autocorrelation at lag 1 and sen s slope estimator was used for assessing the magnitude change 3 1 1 pre monsoon trend test results of pre monsoon season ground water level depth time series are presented in table 1 and fig 3 a the obtained results clearly indicated that groundwater depth in the most of the studied wells n 527 wells showed increasing trends 81 78 and rest of them showed decreasing 18 22 tendency during the period of 1996 2017 about half 46 87 of the wells showed significant increasing trends at different confidence intervals table 1 spatial distribution of z statistics of trend test result is shown in fig 3a the whole study area showed increasing trend in groundwater depth except some pocket areas which are distributed discretely over the study area fig 3a account of significant decreasing trend was only 3 80 table 1 most of the significant increasing trends were found in southern and central part of the lgrb sen s slope analysis revealed that groundwater depth increases on average at a rate of 10 97 cm year over the area similar to significant trend z statistics distribution the higher magnitude of changes 20 cm year were found in the central and southern part of the area fig 5a the magnitude of increasing trend for the major part of the area varied between 6 83 and 95 32 cm year the highest increasing rate 95 32 cm year was found for bamongola dug well located in malda district in west bengal and the highest decreasing rate sen q 70 77 cm year was also found in west bengal at kutubsahar dug well under malda district increasing trends in groundwater depth during pre monsoon adversely affects the agricultural productions especially boro rice which almost entirely depends on groundwater irrigation water requirement during this period is higher due to the higher temperature and evaporation tuinenburg et al 2012 small farmers rely on shallow pumps for irrigated their lands groundwater level may fluctuate below the suction mode of shallow pump in near future due to continuous increasing of groundwater depth and consequently cost of irrigation will increase due to scare shallow groundwater during this high water demand seasons 3 1 2 monsoon the trend analysis results of monsoon ground water depth also showed dominate increasing trends throughout the lgrb during 1996 2017 fig 3b more than half of the wells 62 22 n 527 showed increasing tendency and almost one third of the wells 28 65 showed a significant increasing trend at different confidence levels table 1 the obtained significant increasing trends were mostly found in south eastern and north western part of the lgrb the highest significant increasing trend 104 46 cm year of ground water depth was observed at kuli in murshidabad district of west bengal fig 5b the average rate of increasing of ground water depth obtained from sen slope was 7 63 cm year hence increasing depth of ground water during the rainy season infers that the amount of groundwater recharge of the area is not sufficient for regain the groundwater during this high water season recharge period in other words groundwater abstraction during the dry period is much higher than amount of groundwater recharge during rainy seasons at the same time the numbers of observed wells with significant declining trends were very low 7 6 table 1 sparsely distributed over the study area the highest significant decreasing trend 72 02 c m y e a r was observed in west bengal at bishnupur under the district of bankura fig 4 shows rapid increasing groundwater depth of two most vulnerable observed dug wells of the study area namely dhopagachi and rajgir respectively 3 1 3 post monsoon the spatial distribution of the results of z statistics trend and sen s slope of ground water level depths time series of post monsoon are presented in figs 3c and 5c which are more or less similar to the monsoon season in this period two third 74 38 n 527 of the wells showed positive trends in water level depth below the ground surface and approximately one third 32 06 of the wells showed significant positive trend at the confidence level of 99 95 and 90 respectively table 1 sen s slope analysis revealed that average groundwater depth increases at the rate of 6 76 cm year over the area the degree of increasing trend for the major part of the area varied between 0 01 and 104 44 cm year this may due to inadequate recharge of the wells in the monsoon season however significant positive trends are sparsely distributed over lgrb with maximum concentrated in the south eastern eastern and north western part fig 3c on the contrary a little portion 3 80 of the observation wells showed significant negative trend during 1996 2017 table 1 with the highest significant negative trend 64 17 cm year for bishnupur dug wells located in bankura district of west bengal 3 1 4 winter the spatiotemporal variation of ground water depth trend and their magnitude in the winter time series are presented in figs 3d and 5d the obtained results clearly revealed that groundwater depth of two third 66 79 of the dug wells showed increasing trends and 33 21 rest of the wells showed decreasing trend during 1996 2017 table 1 about one fourth 23 91 of the wells showed significant increasing tendency and only 9 12 wells showed significant decreasing tendency at different confidence levels table 1 most of the significant increasing trends were found in south eastern eastern western and central part of the lgrb and the magnitude of slopes were comparatively lower 0 01 75 78 cm year during this season with an average of 4 30 cm year for the study area the highest increasing 75 78 cm year trend was observed in west bengal at ramjibanpur dug wells under the district of paschim midnapore on the contrary significant decreasing trends were sparsely distributed in pockets over the lgrb fig 3d and the magnitude of trend were varied from 48 83 to 2 27 cm year fig 5d 3 2 trends in rainfall 3 2 1 annual trend the spatial distribution of z statistics and their magnitude of annual rainfall are presented in table 2 and fig 6 b c the results clearly indicated that rainfall pattern in most of the stations total stations n 71 showed decreasing trends 87 32 and rest of them showed increasing 12 68 tendency during the period of 1980 2010 about two third 64 78 of the stations showed significant decreasing tendency at different confidence level while the account for significant increasing trend was only 2 82 table 2 the spatial distribution of z statistics fig 6b shows that decreasing trends are dominating over the study area except the southern part and the northern part up to central part area shows significant decreasing trends and slope varied from 2 70 to 0 44 mm year on the other hand a significant increasing trend was found at south 24 parganas station during the study period magnitude of trend was 2 55 mm year bera 2017 also found highest increasing 4 99 mm year trend at south 24 parganas stations 3 2 2 seasonal trend trend analysis results of seasonal rainfall showed both increasing and decreasing trends throughout the lgrb during 1980 2010 the estimated value of z statistics were 0 80 1 96 0 89 and 0 19 for pre monsoon monsoon post monsoon and winter respectively although the other seasons showed insignificant trend monsoon season rainfall in the basin area is significant at 95 confidence level station wise analysis reveals that the trends of pre monsoon and post monsoon are dominated by insignificant increasing trend accounting for 52 and 50 70 respectively monsoon and winter season were dominated by significant decreasing 74 65 and insignificant decreasing 52 11 trends respectively table 2 the entire basin area showed an increasing trend in pre monsoon season rainfall except the extreme south eastern part fig 7 a monsoon trend map fig 7b shows similar spatial distribution of trends for annual rainfall insignificant increasing trends in post monsoon season rainfall were found throughout the basin except the northwestern part fig 7c whereas insignificant decreasing trend in winter season were observed over whole basin area except few pockets of northern and western part of the basin area fig 7d bera 2017 also identified significantly decreasing trend in pre monsoon and monsoon rainfall over ganga basin during 1901 2000 however the magnitude of rainfall trend in pre monsoon post monsoon and winter are very low fig 7 while in monsoon season the slope of trend is quite high 1 42 mm year 4 irrigated area there is no direct record of the amount of annual groundwater abstraction for the study area this study used the irrigated area to get idea about groundwater abstraction for boro rice irrigation fig 8 shows that there is no increasing trend in boro rice irrigated area during the period 1997 2014 however it showed a slow decreasing trend both in west bengal

lgrb for the years 1997 and 2014 respectively fig 9c shows the changes in irrigated area in lgrb witnessed the comparatively more positive change at southern 17147 91 61481 00 ha and less in eastern central and western 0 01 17147 91 ha region rest of the basin area showed a negative change 69218 00 0 00 ha during the study period 5 conclusions this study documented the linkage of groundwater
