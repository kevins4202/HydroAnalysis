10820,long term evaluation of soil chemical changes in the soil is required to optimize irrigation of protected crops and to control associated environmental issues in this study the multi component solute transport module unsatchem of hydrus 1d was used to assess the effects of long term 2018 2050 irrigation on salt build up in the soil under unheated greenhouse conditions blended water recycled water artificially recharged groundwater and harvested rainwater was used to irrigate tomato cucumber capsicum and eggplant irrigation management included four leaching fractions lf i e accounting for 0 15 20 and 30 of applied excess water the effects of four amounts of annual gypsum application i e 0 1 7 2 6 and 3 4 t ha were also simulated model simulated annual root water uptake by cucumber tomato capsicum and eggplant was 303 476 642 and 649 mm respectively for an irrigation schedule based on outdoor temperature thresholds annual drainage was 4 1 6 1 of irrigation for these crops average salinity in the soil solution ecsw at the end of the simulation year 2050 reached 6 5 ds m for cucumber 7 6 ds m for tomato 8 7 ds m for capsicum and 9 3 ds m for eggplant soil salinity was building up at a nearly constant rate over 33 years exchangeable sodium percentage esp at the end of the simulation was 30 8 for tomato 27 1 for capsicum 33 2 for eggplant and 31 4 for cucumber these results indicate that both salinity and sodicity will exceed critical threshold values and thus must be managed to maintain sustainability of irrigated horticulture modeling showed that higher irrigation up to 15 20 coupled with an annual addition of gypsum of 1 7 t ha kept both salinity and sodicity sar esp below critical thresholds while ph was reduced from 8 7 to 7 8 thus creating a favorable soil environment for long term sustainable vegetable production under greenhouse conditions the new gypsum application module implemented in the unsatchem model has broad applicability in evaluating soil amendment scenarios to address sodicity hazards linked to long term irrigation keywords tomato capsicum cucumber eggplant unsatchem irrigation esp salinity 1 introduction protected agriculture is steadily growing around the world fao 2017 with greenhouse vegetable production being one of the most important and profitable agricultural systems greenhouses provide an opportunity to partially modify climatic parameters in order to develop effective growing systems under otherwise adverse conditions due to climate variability and climate change in australia the protected cropping industry has an estimated value of 1 8 billion at the farm gate which accounts for approximately 20 of the total gross value of the production of vegetables and cut flowers pca 2019 crops commonly grown in greenhouses in australia include tomato capsicum eggplant and cucumber ausveg 2019a nevertheless most greenhouses up to 80 in australia are low cost structures with soil grown crops parks et al 2009 ausveg 2019b nguyen 2019 though the number of high technology structures on soilless growing media has been increasing in recent years to meet specific market requirements ausveg 2019b nguyen 2019 high tech greenhouses could be five to ten times more expensive than low cost soil based greenhouses nguyen 2019 therefore in the northern adelaide plains most growers do not have the capital required to construct high tech greenhouses and instead choose to use low cost systems where risk levels are lower water availability and quality are the most important factors that determine the expansion of protected agriculture it is well understood that greenhouse crops cannot be grown profitably with highly saline water stanghellini et al 2007 to manage both water quantity and quality many irrigators have to make use of several water sources which are either conventional surface and groundwater or non conventional recycled wastewater desalinated water brackish water treated produced water from oil and gas production etc various qualities of different water sources add a higher level of complexity to irrigation water management and their use poses a new challenge to managers and irrigators reca et al 2018 therefore in many arid and semiarid regions salinization of soil and water resources is increasing in protected horticulture pardossi et al 2004 machado and serralheiro 2017 since most crops including vegetables grown in soil based greenhouses are highly sensitive to salinity the knowledge of salinity build up in soil is important for optimal irrigation management stanghellini et al 2007 similarly in the northern adelaide plains nap region of south australia yields of soil grown tomato and cucumber crops have been steadily declining for several years due to high salinity high sodium and chloride levels in the soil ferguson et al 2012 the reason for the decline was found to be the poor quality of primary water sources which was either saline bore or recycled water with an ec of 2 4 ds m due to limited storage capacity only a minimal amount of rainwater was captured from greenhouse roofs that could be blended with irrigation water to dilute its salinity likewise shi et al 2009 observed high accumulation of soil nutrients which led to higher soil salinity in long term greenhouse cultivations some nutrients that accumulate in the root zone may leach downward with the application of irrigation water causing soil and groundwater contamination colombani et al 2015 kim et al 2008 most greenhouse farmers follow irrigation and fertigation practices based on their experiences thompson et al 2007 without monitoring or controlling the soil water nutrient and salt status therefore accurate estimations of crop water requirements are needed to avoid either salt build up in the soil profile or excess water applications that would negatively impact nutrient availability for plants and leaching of agrochemicals to groundwater blanco and folegatti 2004 effective irrigation scheduling in closed growing structures depends on accurate estimates of crop evapotranspiration etc however direct measurement methods of crop water requirements e g weighing lysimeters stem gauges are either expensive or may not be practical to implement in commercial greenhouse settings villarreal guerrero et al 2012 alternatively simulation models offer cost effective and non destructive approaches to estimate crop water use among such models the fao 56 methodology allen et al 1998 has been used worldwide to determine crop water requirements under open field conditions and this methodology can also be applied to greenhouse crops bonachela et al 2006 qiu et al 2015 to use the fao 56 methodology for greenhouse crops measurements of greenhouse reference evapotranspiration et0 and crop coefficients kc are required fernández et al 2010 möller and assouline 2007 observed that daily et0 in a cropped greenhouse calculated following the fao 56 methodology averaged only about 62 of the estimated outdoor value the main reason for the reduction in et0 compared to outdoors was a significant reduction in solar radiation inside the greenhouse 56 of open field conditions and lower wind speeds which decrease the exchange of water vapor between the crop canopy and greenhouse atmosphere farias et al 1994 observed that et0 inside greenhouses was always 45 77 lower than outside braga and klar 2000 observed that et0 values inside greenhouses oriented east west and north south were 85 and 80 respectively of outdoor et0 however harmanto et al 2005 found that etc estimated using measured climate data in a greenhouse was about 75 80 of etc observed in an open environment several software packages such as prho v2 0 fernandez et al 2009 and vegsyst gallardo et al 2011 2016 have been developed that are based on the fao 56 method with a single kc approach and that simulate etc crop growth and crop n uptake of greenhouse grown vegetable crops due to the complexity involved in measuring climate variables and crop data such as the leaf area index other simple methods for accurately estimating greenhouse et0 that use for example the temperature based hargreaves equation fernández et al 2010 have been explored empirical approaches widely used under open field conditions that only require temperature and greenhouse radiation data allen et al 1998 itenfisu et al 2003 gavilán et al 2006 could be easily applied for determining greenhouse et0 boulard and wang 2000 nikolaou et al 2017 found a good correlation between leaf temperature and transpiration for a soilless greenhouse cucumber crop with the prediction equation being validated for different greenhouse climatic conditions however such irrigation practices have often oversimplified the complex nature of the interacting climate soil and crop variables involved in the estimation of crop water requirements for example irrigation scheduling for greenhouse crops based on outdoor temperature is practiced by growers in the nap who consider only 60 of outdoor etc awad et al 2019 while this simplified approach requires less data there is a need to test its effectiveness for long term irrigation while also safeguarding chemical quality of soil observations of soil health over one or several seasons won t reveal the potential adverse impacts of irrigation induced salinity and sodicity which usually arise only after many years of inappropriate irrigation scheduling hence there is the need for long term simulations that incorporate the soil processes that can lead to accumulation of various salts in the soil profile e g mallants et al 2017 processed based numerical models are excellent tools to enhance our understanding of the long term impact of irrigation on salinity e g phogat et al 2018 and sodicity risks in the receiving environment among these models the multi component major ion chemistry module unsatchem of the hydrus 1d software package šimůnek et al 2016 is an excellent tool intended to predict major ion chemistry as well as water and solute fluxes in soils during transient conditions while the water flow and solute transport components of the standard hydrus 1d model have been used widely e g phogat et al 2018 applications of the major ion chemistry module have been limited because of its complexity and a lack of appropriate experimental data e g gonçalves et al 2006 ramos et al 2011 however several short term studies mainly focused on assessing the impact of using high sar water suarez et al 2006 sodic soil reclamation simunek and suarez 1997 kaledhonkar et al 2006 wang et al 2014 water quality requirements mallants et al 2017 and solute transport ramos et al 2011 under irrigation with saline degraded water skaggs et al 2014 therefore simulations of the movement of dissolved solutes and precipitation dissolution reactions of salts in soils have been a useful complement to experimental data suarez 2001 also computer modelling may help assess the viability of different water uses such as blending and test the efficacy of soil amelioration methods applications with the major ion chemistry module unsatchem of hydrus 1d for assessing long term risks of irrigation with recycled water and associated blends and reclamation options for greenhouse crops are limited in this study we evaluate the impact of the long term 2018 2050 use of irrigation water blended from waters of different qualities recycled water managed aquifer recharge mar water and harvested rainwater on soil chemical changes for soil grown crops under greenhouse conditions we explore various management options such as increased leaching fractions and annual gypsum applications to avoid excessive build up of soil salinity and sodicity we additionally also seek to identify how to make the best use of blended water for sustainable irrigation in the nap region finally we also implement a new capability into the unsatchem module allowing an annual application of a solid form of gypsum in order to reduce the exchangeable sodium percentage esp levels in the soils the outcome of these long term simulations accounting for future climate predictions would help in devising better irrigation guidelines for growing vegetable crops under protected environments while also accommodating higher water needs owing to a future hotter climate 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and soil parameters the northern adelaide plain nap region is one of the important greenhouse crop growing areas in australia due to its flat topography existing agricultural and horticultural infrastructure and access to an urban market the nap is well suited for irrigated annual horticulture in the last decade 220 commercial establishments have emerged in the nap showing a 38 growth in greenhouse cropped area pirsa spatial information services 2017 however fresh water is a key input which influences crop yield and soil degradation the region experiences a mediterranean climate characterized by hot dry summers and cool to cold winters long term 1900 2016 average rainfall in the region is 475 mm department of environment water and natural resources 2016 and annual evapotranspiration is 1308 mm resulting in the need for irrigation for crop production soil samples for this study were collected in triplicates from two greenhouses in the region awad et al 2019 at two depths 0 20 and 20 30 cm these samples were analyzed for their physico chemical properties following standard procedures mallants et al 2019 the soil texture in the first greenhouse s1 is categorized as sandy clay loam at both depths with sand silt and clay contents varying from 47 9 to 62 2 12 9 23 4 and 23 4 31 5 respectively similarly the soil texture of the second greenhouse s2 was categorized as sandy loam at both depths the organic carbon oc content varied from 0 77 to 1 06 in s1 while it was nearly double 1 38 1 97 in the second soil s2 average soil water contents at saturation 0 01 kpa and at 4 8 33 60 100 and 1500 kpa and the saturated hydraulic conductivity table 1 of the two soils were fitted using the van genuchten mualem analytical model van genuchten 1980 to obtain soil hydraulic parameters for the unsatchem module table 1 soil chemical parameters required by the unsatchem module include the gapon exchange constants the initial concentrations of soil exchangeable cations k na ca2 mg2 and the initial solution composition k na ca2 mg2 alkalinity so4 2 cl in the soil profile the latter was defined using the solution composition of harvested rainwater collected in the greenhouses in the nap region table 2 awad et al 2019 exchangeable cations were determined using nh4cl solution at either ph 7 0 or ph 8 5 depending on the soil ph rayment and lyons 2011 the cation exchange capacity cec was assumed to be equal to the sum of adsorbed concentrations of the four cations na ca2 mg2 and k and it was assumed that the cec 107 4 161 5 meq kg soil is constant and ph independent notably the esp varied from 9 52 to 16 61 which was much higher than the threshold value 6 for australian conditions gapon constants were taken from mallants et al 2019 who estimated these values for similar soils in the nap region values of soil exchangeable cations and gapon constants for both soils used in the modeling simulations are shown in table 3 soil hydraulic table 1 and chemical properties table 3 measured in the 20 30 cm soil layer were assumed to extend to 200 cm the domain depth as the soils had almost uniform texture below 20 cm 2 2 unsatchem and its gypsum module the study focussed on long term simulations 1970 2050 using hydrus 1d with the unsatchem module šimůnek et al 2016 for evaluating the impact of the use of irrigation water blended from different water sources recycled water managed aquifer recharge mar and harvested rainwater for irrigation of crops grown under greenhouses conditions unsatchem is a multi component major ion chemistry module which is particularly well suitable for quantitative predictions of processes involving major ions such as simulations of the effects of salinity on plant growth and estimating the amount of water and amendments required to reclaim soil profiles to desired levels of salinity and esp šimůnek et al 2016 different components of the hydrus 1d model which are applicable for this study are described comprehensively in šimůnek et al 2013 and šimůnek et al 2016 the form of the one dimensional richards equation that is solved in hydrus 1d by the galerkin type linear finite element scheme assumes that the air phase plays an insignificant role in the liquid flow process and that water flow due to thermal gradients can be neglected šimůnek et al 2013 the single porosity van genuchten mualem model šimůnek et al 2016 was used in this study the major ion chemistry module in hydrus 1d enables the simulation of equilibrium reactions involving ca mg na k so4 cl no3 h4sio4 hco3 and co2 šimůnek and suarez 1997 šimůnek et al 2013 the phases considered are aqueous gaseous adsorbed precipitated and complexed šimůnek and suarez 1997 šimůnek et al 2013 partitioning of dissolved major ions between the solid and solution phases is described using the gapon eqs 1 3 white and zelazny 1986 and gapon selectivity coefficients

include both forward and backward reactions a new annual gypsum application module has been incorporated in the existing unsatchem module which simulates the real time amelioration of the soil suffering from increased sodicity esp due to the prolonged use of irrigation waters of low quality high esp develops as a result of dynamic chemical exchanges between the solution and the solid phase after the application of irrigation water of high sodium adsorption ratio sar 2 3 irrigation inputs and crop parameters a survey by awad et al 2019 found that four crops tomato capsicum cucumber and eggplant are commonly grown under greenhouse conditions in the nap the growing season for these crops in the nap starts in january and lasts until the end of september november may and november for tomato capsicum cucumber and eggplant respectively growers schedule irrigation events based on their own experience the growth stage of various crops and air temperature awad et al 2019 from information provided by growers the following temperature threshold values and ranges were identified for scheduling of different irrigation frequencies temperature 20 c temperature between 20 c 25 c temperature between 25 c 30 c temperature between 30 c 35 c and temperature 35 c with irrigation frequencies of once per week every 4th day 3 times per week every second day and daily respectively utilizing the information provided by the growers awad et al 2019 developed a simple model iq qc2 which estimates daily irrigation requirements of crops and allows the mixing of different available water qualities the model adopted a temporally uniform 0 6 factor to convert open field crop evapotranspiration etc to greenhouse water requirement of the crops monthly kc values for tomato cucumber capsicum and eggplant used in the iq qc2 mixing model were taken from fao 56 allen et al 1998 average seasonal etc of all crops evaluated by iq qc2 matched the temperature based irrigation schedule adopted by the local growers therefore we adopted the daily irrigation application output from iq qc2 for the long term unsatchem simulations for each crop the average annual irrigation amount over the modeling period 1970 2050 predicted by iq qc2 amounted to 490 12 654 16 312 8 and 667 16 mm for tomato capsicum cucumber and eggplant respectively apart from daily crop water requirements iq qc2 also generates the associated water quality parameters based on the usage of available waters for irrigation such as recycled water harvested rainwater and artificially recharged groundwater the iq qc2 tool also calculates roof runoff water capture based on the roof area m2 and available storage capacity m3 this was done to reduce the required storage size and subsequently to increase the total volume of runoff that could be captured if two sources of water are available e g reclaimed water and artificially recharged groundwater the source that has the lower salinity level measured as tds value is used first when the required volume is less than the volume licensed for this source otherwise the other source the source with a higher salinity level is used water qualities used in this modeling study are given in table 3 water quality data represents the median water quality of treated sewage water at the bolivar plant mar water from the salisbury storage recovery well and the harvested rainwater from greenhouse roofs awad et al 2019 concentrations of all chemical constituents of blended water k na ca2 mg2 alkalinity so4 2 cl are estimated by iq qc2 as weighted averages of constituent concentrations of each water used monthly averaged blended irrigation water quality data thus obtained from iq qc2 for multiple years was used in unsatchem table 4 other crop specific inputs such as root water uptake parameters feddes et al 1978 were obtained from the hydrus database parameters for the salinity threshold slope functions for tomato capsicum and cucumber were taken from maas and hoffman 1977 and for eggplant from heuer et al 1986 the two parameters for these functions i e the threshold ece ds m and slope yield reduction per ds m for tomato capsicum cucumber and eggplant were 2 5 ds m and 9 9 1 5 ds m and 14 2 5 ds m and 13 and 1 1 ds m and 6 9 respectively the maximum rooting depth was assumed as 1 m for all crops which falls within the range of 0 7 1 2 0 5 1 0 0 7 1 2 and 0 7 1 2 m for tomato capsicum cucumber and eggplant respectively as reported by allen et al 1998 2 4 climate parameters climate parameters for the etc estimation were required for two periods the first one is a 48 year warming up period from january 1970 to december 2017 for each crop to attain equilibrium conditions for the soil water and chemical balance while the second one is the actual 33 year impact assessment period from january 2018 to december 2050 data for the first period were obtained from the bureau of meteorology station at edinburgh 34 71 s 138 62 e bom station number 023083 while data for the second period were based on downscaled climate projections i e median future climate for edinburgh by the general circulation model gfdl esm2m at rcp representative concentration pathway 4 5 charles and fu 2015 rainfall and soil evaporation were not considered in the simulations as these are controlled by the presence of closed growing structures greenhouse 2 5 modeling domain and initial and boundary conditions a uniform 2 m domain was considered for all crops tomato capsicum cucumber and eggplant with two distinct layers 0 15 and 15 to 200 cm the initial time step of 0 0001 d the minimum time step of 1 10 5 d and the maximum time step of 0 1 d were used in this study one hundred and one finite element nodes were generated for the 200 cm soil domain using a lower density 0 5 in the surface layer 15 cm and a higher density 1 at deeper depths the root density was assumed to decrease linearly from the soil surface to the maximum rooting depth of 1 m the initially uniform pressure head 100 cm condition was assumed while the initial solution composition was assumed to be equilibrated with the rainwater composition the measured exchange composition and cec were used in different soil layers table 2 to simulate water movement the surface boundary condition was specified as an atmospheric boundary with the maximum surface water layer of 5 cm i e whenever irrigation exceeds the soil s infiltration capacity water ponds at the soil surface and infiltrates overtime when irrigation stops a free drainage bc was imposed at the bottom of the soil profile zero precipitation was considered by the model for protected crop conditions however irrigation amounts estimated by the iq qc2 model awad et al 2019 for each crop was assumed as a time variable flux applied at the top boundary for solute transport the concentration flux boundary condition was selected for the upper boundary condition for the lower boundary condition the zero gradient boundary condition is the most appropriate particularly when water flow is directed out of the modeled domain šimůnek et al 2013 initially the model was warmed up for 48 years from 1970 till 2018 under historical climate with an estimated irrigation schedule for each crop and rainwater composition table 2 discussed in section 2 3 to establish a quasi equilibrium between the soil solution and the soil exchange complex subsequently a monthly varied average irrigation quality table 4 obtained from the iq qc2 model awad et al 2019 was applied during the irrigation application to each crop 2 6 modeling scenarios initially a base scenario was run for each crop tomato capsicum cucumber and eggplant using an irrigation schedule for unheated greenhouse cultivation used by the growers in the nap awad et al 2019 and other inputs described above although the initial soil esp was higher than the australian standard esp 6 a base scenario for each crop was performed to compare the efficacy of management scenarios on the reduction of the salinity and sodicity hazards relative to the base scenario the model was then run for numerous management scenarios developed based on the outcome of the initial scenario these scenarios included 4 leaching fractions lf in of excess water applied i e lf0 0 lf0 15 15 lf0 2 20 and lf0 3 30 and four annual gypsum applications i e g0 0 meq kg soil or 0 t ha g10 10 meq kg soil or 1 7 t ha g15 15 meq kg soil or 2 6 t ha and g20 20 meq kg or 3 4 t ha no gypsum was applied during the warming up period 1970 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 water balance components model simulated water balance components obtained for the base scenarios reflecting current farmers irrigation practices for different greenhouse crops are shown in fig 1 the annual values of root water uptake for all crops are close to their average annual irrigation applications 490 2 653 8 667 6 and 311 6 mm for tomato capsicum eggplant and cucumber respectively average annual root water uptake across all years by tomato capsicum eggplant and cucumber was 476 642 649 and 303 mm respectively however the corresponding average drainage component was only 4 6 5 4 6 1 and 4 1 of the total irrigation application respectively such low values are below the recommended leaching fraction lf needed to flush accumulated salts from the crop root zone typically open field crop irrigation designs require a 10 20 higher water application for salinity control depending on the crop soil and water quality hoffman and shannon 2007 in some cases this fraction can be higher than 20 if climate and soil encourage salinity build up in the soils and when crops are highly sensitive to salinity hoffman and shannon 2007 rhodes and loveday 1990 suggested a leaching fraction of 20 50 as ideal value for such conditions including for irrigation with recycled water as the leaching fraction is dependent on local conditions of soil climate and crop the determination of the minimum leaching requirement was undertaken in this study as one of the management scenarios 3 2 soil ph and salinity ecsw dynamics under different crops simulated annual values of ph and ecsw for base scenarios for different crops are shown in fig 2 for both soils s1 and s2 the subsequent discussion is based on the results for soil s1 while those for s2 are very similar the ph values decreased gradually although the magnitude of the reduction was very small less than 5 these changes in soil ph were expected due to the lower ph of irrigation water 6 95 7 4 table 2 as compared to the initial soil solution 8 4 8 7 which gradually brought down the soil ph to achieve a quasi equilibrium at the end of the simulation in the year 2050 the average ph values in the soils varied in a narrow range 8 1 8 4 for all crops the final ph depends on the amount of irrigation water showing the lowest ph for crops receiving the most water capsicum and eggplant the highest ph is for the crop receiving the least water cucumber with the ph for tomato in between on the other hand there was a similarly sharp increase in the profile average ecsw values under all crops the ecsw build up was the lowest under cucumber followed by tomato these results are consistent with the lower amounts of seasonal irrigation applied to those two crops meanwhile the highest annual ecsw was observed for capsicum and eggplant this is the result of the higher irrigation application for these crops and a longer cropping season jan to oct nov as compared to cucumber jan may and tomato jan sept the profile average ecsw in year 2050 rose to 6 5 7 6 8 7 and 9 3 ds m for cucumber tomato capsicum and eggplant respectively these values are above the salinity tolerance thresholds ecsw was derived from published ece values as ecsw 2 ece for these crops i e 5 5 3 4 and 2 ds m respectively maas and hoffman 1977 sonneveld and vogt 2009 bonachela et al 2018 observed that mean ec of the soil solution extracted by suction cups under a greenhouse tomato crop ranged between 6 7 ds m which is similar to the results obtained in the current study whether these salinity levels were the result of farmers over irrigating to overcome the salinity problem was not known as leaching practices were not well documented bonachela et al 2018 however soil salinization mostly depends on the amount of applied saline water meiri 1984 shalhevet 1994 therefore a leaching fraction should be applied well ahead of the salt accumulation in the root environment reaching hazardous levels meiri 1984 shalhevet 1994 or the evaporative demand increases fernández et al 2010 due to climate variability and or change therefore a soil with continued high salinity values above crop thresholds can create considerable osmotic impacts which reduces crop water uptake and renders the soil unfit for crop production on the other hand soilless production systems typically adopt a large leaching fraction 30 40 bonachela et al 2018 which is a fundamental management consideration for these growing systems to maintain the salinity of the root zone solution at levels which are not detrimental to the optimal crop production sonneveld 2000 to avoid problems caused by the accumulation of salts a sizable proportion of the applied nutrient solution has to be drained leading to the so called drain to waste system van os 1995 therefore soilless systems such as hydroponics are associated with a substantial loss of water and can potentially represent a major input of salts and agrochemicals to groundwater if untreated discharge occurs 3 3 soil esp and sar dynamics under different crops similarly annual average sar and esp values for base scenarios in the greenhouse soils also showed an increasing trend for all crops fig 2 initial in 2018 average sar in the soil solution varied from 1 to 1 9 in s1 under different crops and increased by 2 2 1 8 1 7 and 1 8 times till 2050 under tomato capsicum cucumber and eggplant crops respectively similarly sar values in sandy loam soil s2 also showed a rapid increase 1 8 to 2 8 times during 33 years of irrigation with blended water the final values of sar in 2050 in sandy clay loam s1 soil ranged from 2 6 to 5 1 while the corresponding vales in sandy loam s2 soil varied from 3 3 6 6 likewise the esp values in sandy clay loam scl soil s1 at the end of the simulation the year 2050 were 30 8 27 1 31 4 and 33 2 under tomato capsicum cucumber and eggplant respectively the initial esp values 9 5 16 6 table 3 in the soil were also high they had gradually increased over the model initial equilibration period 1970 2018 and varied for different crops in response to the amount of irrigation water applied an increase in esp during 33 years of cropping 2018 2050 in absolute values ranged from 9 to 11 which was an increase of 39 55 compared to the corresponding values during 2018 a rapid increase in esp leads to values much higher than the critical esp 6 which can lead to the development of sodic soils under australian conditions northcote and skene 1972 it can worsen the sodicity risk in the existing sodic soils similar changes in soil ph ecsw sar and esp were also observed in the sandy loam soil s2 for all crops fig 2 dot points however the magnitude of these parameters was different for different crops a strong logarithmic relationship was observed between sarsw and esp in both soils fig 3 initially esp increased by a factor of two or more when sarsw risen from 2 to 6 subsequently the esp build up occurred at a lower rate and reached a similar value as sar for sarsw of 18 19 esp then decreased with a further increase in sarsw numerous studies have attempted to establish relations between sariw sar of irrigation water sare sar of the saturation extract and esp of the soils in different parts of the world ussl staff 1954 paliwal and gandhi 1976 shainberg et al 1980 ghafoor et al 1988 evangelou and marsi 2003 seilsepour et al 2009 chi et al 2011 observed similar logarithmic relations between esp vs sare and esp vs sar1 5 as in our study and found insignificant differences between the two contrary the higher esp build up at lower sarsw levels observed in our study differed from an almost linear relation up to sar 40 in some other studies e g ussl 1954 paliwal and gandhi 1976 ghafoor et al 1988 however most of these relations were based on sar of irrigation water sariw which is different from sar of soil solution sarsw normally the salt concentration in soils is highly dynamic and much higher than the salt concentration in irrigation water which may have affected the impact of the interaction between solution and exchange phases ussl 1954 interestingly rengasamy et al 1984 observed for the australian surface soils 0 15 cm linear relation between sar1 5 and esp esp 1 95 and sar1 5 1 8 which is similar to our current study with lower sarsw values up to 6 subsequently stevens et al 2003 extended this relation for nap soils by including the data from the 0 100 cm soil depth and found a curvilinear rather than linear relation thus it is clear that approximate relationships between sar and esp vary with site specific clay contents mineralogy salinity of the equilibrium solution and the saturation percentage of the soil solution the data in fig 3 further reveals that sarsw of 2 3 can potentially lead to the development of esp higher than given the value provided by the australian standard esp 6 for the development of sodicity hazards in the soil rengasamy et al 1984 also suggested that a sar 1 5 soil water ratio larger than 3 is associated with clay dispersion crusting and reduced porosity in similar soils however they found a strong correlation between clay dispersion and both sar and the total cation concentration tcc in another study rengasamy and marchuk 2011 proposed an alternative ratio cross to sar it includes other cations mg2 and k that can induce dispersive soil behavior which is critical for characterizing the structural stability of the soils however we understand that different cations e g na k and mg2 have different effects on clay dispersion in different soils and that these effects depend on all inherent soil characteristics which affect the biogeochemical dynamics of the soil solution and soil exchange these results suggest that an irrigation schedule for greenhouse crops in the nap region without a significant leaching fraction and or gypsum addition appears not to suffice to avoid the buildup of salinity and sodicity in the soil therefore there is a need to improve irrigation scheduling with an appropriate leaching fraction lf as well as with regular applications of a suitable amount of gypsum g for controlling salinity and sodicity these management scenarios will be discussed next alternatively an application of soluble ca as part of irrigation can also help in keeping esp under control however rapid leaching of soluble ca or its likely precipitation in the soil as calcite at high ph may reduce the effectiveness of added soluble ca 3 4 management scenarios additional scenarios were performed with different leaching fractions lf0 15 lf0 2 and lf0 3 and annual gypsum applications g10 g15 g20 for tomato the results show that an increased leaching fraction without additions of gypsum produces a small increase in soil ph fig 4 gypsum additions at an annual rate of 10 meq kg soil g10 1 7 t ha combined with any non zero leaching fraction reduced soil ph at all depths by 7 5 9 4 however a further increase in the gypsum application g15 g20 regardless of leaching fractions had only a small impact on subsequent reductions 0 4 0 8 in soil ph overall average ph had been reduced to 7 7 7 8 which is a suitable range for an optimal nutrient availability for crops roques et al 2013 therefore an annual gypsum application of 10 meq kg soil 1 7 t ha combined with lf 0 15 lf 0 3 seems adequate for maintaining soil ph within a suitable range 6 0 8 0 similarly the ecsw in the soil decreased below the tomato threshold ecsw 5 ds m for all non zero lfs which suggests that a minimum lf of 0 15 is adequate to maintain the soil salinity below the threshold fig 4 as expected applications of gypsum increased the soluble ion concentration in the soil leading to an increase in the ecsw at all depths although it was still below the crop threshold it is worth noting that increasing the lf alone didn t reduce sar and esp in the soil to acceptable levels clearly these impairments require additional soil amendments such as applications of gypsum to reduce their impact on soils and crops the results show that an addition of gypsum at an annual rate of 10 meq kg soil 1 7 t ha along with a leaching fraction lf of 0 15 reduced sar and esp below thresholds within the top 30 cm soil depth however this combination was unable to lower sar and esp below threshold levels at the 60 90 cm depth a further increase in gypsum additions to 15 g15 and 20 meq kg g20 combined with a leaching fraction lf of 0 15 also did not further reduce sar and esp in the soil at deeper depths only when a minimum lf of 0 2 was combined with an annual addition of gypsum of at least 10 meq kg soil 1 7 t ha did average sar and esp drop below thresholds at greater soil depths other scenarios were also explored in which leaching fractions less than 0 15 were used together with different gypsum additions g10 g15 and g20 while ecsw dropped below its thresholds these scenarios were unable to lower esp below the critical threshold data not shown therefore it is suggested that for shallow rooted soil grown vegetables in the nap region additions of gypsum at a rate of 10 t ha with an lf of 0 15 is able to keep the soil free from the salinity and sodicity build up under greenhouse conditions on the other hand for deep rooted crops a combination of an lf of 0 2 with an annual gypsum addition of 10 meq kg soil or higher would contribute to maintaining a sustainable production under long term greenhouse conditions time series of profile average ph ecsw sar and esp values obtained for lfs of 0 and 0 2 and different annual gypsum additions 0 10 15 meq kg soil for tomato are shown in fig 5 the scenario with g10 and 0 2 l f had initial average profile esp values higher than the threshold esp 6 these esp values then gradually decreased to values similar to those obtained for the scenario with annual additions of gypsum of 15 meq kg soil g15 at the end of the simulation in the year 2050 similarly average sar values initially increased and subsequently decreased below the threshold ph was reduced by 8 7 to an average value around 7 8 and ecsw was much lower than the tomato tolerance threshold 5 ds m similar results were obtained for the sandy loam soil s2 with cucumber fig 6 apparently the amount of irrigation 312 mm for cucumber versus 490 mm for tomato and soil properties also influenced the effectiveness of lf and gypsum additions for reclaiming the soils other factors such as purity of gypsum particle size uniformity of application and mixing in the soil also influence the effectiveness of gypsum in reducing esp in the soil were not evaluated in this study overall the results from the current modeling study suggest that a long term irrigation schedule without significant leaching fraction may lead to salinity and sodicity problems there is clearly a need to apply a leaching fraction of 15 20 for leaching the salts below the crop root zone even blended water used for irrigation has a strong tendency to build up sodicity in the soil therefore annual applications of gypsum at 1 7 2 6 t ha or preferably based on a soil test or similar ca amounts from other sources should be applied to overcome the sodicity hazard in the soil the survey conducted by awad et al 2019 found that many growers apply annually organics compost and ca through nutrient solutions both of these additions help in alleviating sodicity hazards in the soil however continued monitoring of the salinity and sodicity status of the soil is an essential aspect of soil management that allows one to intervene well before issues occur the results obtained from the current study are specific for the considered crops soils climate and water qualities several other factors involved in growing protected crops were not considered in this study such as different substrates effects of ventilation and evaporative cooling these factors can also impact the water use and its management and related issues such as salinity and sodicity developments the concentration of nutrients the quality of soil substrate and local issues such as leachate management may also impact the plant water requirement and its effective management simulation tools such as those used in this study can account for these additional conditions and thus help develop guidelines for practitioners aimed at maintaining sustainable production systems 4 conclusions protected agriculture is a popular cultivation system especially for vegetable crops these are highly efficient systems in term of the consumption of energy and other inputs such as water and fertilizers however suitable water is often scarce in regions where these production systems exist such as in the vicinity of urban arid or semi arid environments therefore in most cases low quality water is used directly or in combination with other available water resources such as harvested rainwater unfortunately low quality waters are often used without knowing the harmful impacts on crop productivity soil health and the wider environment this study used the multi component major ion chemistry module unsatchem of the hydrus 1d model to evaluate the effects of long term 2018 2050 irrigation with blended water for a range of soil grown crops under unheated greenhouse conditions the results revealed that irrigation schedules for future climate projections that do not apply a significant leaching fraction might lead to a high salt build up and esp development in the soil the soil solution salinity ecsw can increase to 6 5 9 ds m at year 2050 and esp can rise to 27 33 for all crops considered these conditions could render the soil unfit for crop production and could potentially degrade the associated environment therefore appropriate management options should be implemented to keep the irrigation induced harmful impacts under control the study evaluated the efficacy of increased leaching and gypsum additions to control salinity and sodicity for this purpose the unsatchem module was extended with a new capability to allow annual gypsum applications management scenarios with different leaching fractions for salinity control showed that 15 20 more water per irrigation would be required to keep the salinity under control for soil grown greenhouse vegetables results obtained in various scenarios with irrigation waters with high sar and esp suggest that annual gypsum application at a rate of 1 7 t ha together with a leaching fraction of at least 20 was adequate for managing this hazard in other words management options that implement both a significant leaching fraction and gypsum amendments are required finally the long term monitoring of highly efficient greenhouse production systems is essential for early identification of irrigation induced soil salinity and other associated issues declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments authors acknowledge the financial support by

10820,long term evaluation of soil chemical changes in the soil is required to optimize irrigation of protected crops and to control associated environmental issues in this study the multi component solute transport module unsatchem of hydrus 1d was used to assess the effects of long term 2018 2050 irrigation on salt build up in the soil under unheated greenhouse conditions blended water recycled water artificially recharged groundwater and harvested rainwater was used to irrigate tomato cucumber capsicum and eggplant irrigation management included four leaching fractions lf i e accounting for 0 15 20 and 30 of applied excess water the effects of four amounts of annual gypsum application i e 0 1 7 2 6 and 3 4 t ha were also simulated model simulated annual root water uptake by cucumber tomato capsicum and eggplant was 303 476 642 and 649 mm respectively for an irrigation schedule based on outdoor temperature thresholds annual drainage was 4 1 6 1 of irrigation for these crops average salinity in the soil solution ecsw at the end of the simulation year 2050 reached 6 5 ds m for cucumber 7 6 ds m for tomato 8 7 ds m for capsicum and 9 3 ds m for eggplant soil salinity was building up at a nearly constant rate over 33 years exchangeable sodium percentage esp at the end of the simulation was 30 8 for tomato 27 1 for capsicum 33 2 for eggplant and 31 4 for cucumber these results indicate that both salinity and sodicity will exceed critical threshold values and thus must be managed to maintain sustainability of irrigated horticulture modeling showed that higher irrigation up to 15 20 coupled with an annual addition of gypsum of 1 7 t ha kept both salinity and sodicity sar esp below critical thresholds while ph was reduced from 8 7 to 7 8 thus creating a favorable soil environment for long term sustainable vegetable production under greenhouse conditions the new gypsum application module implemented in the unsatchem model has broad applicability in evaluating soil amendment scenarios to address sodicity hazards linked to long term irrigation keywords tomato capsicum cucumber eggplant unsatchem irrigation esp salinity 1 introduction protected agriculture is steadily growing around the world fao 2017 with greenhouse vegetable production being one of the most important and profitable agricultural systems greenhouses provide an opportunity to partially modify climatic parameters in order to develop effective growing systems under otherwise adverse conditions due to climate variability and climate change in australia the protected cropping industry has an estimated value of 1 8 billion at the farm gate which accounts for approximately 20 of the total gross value of the production of vegetables and cut flowers pca 2019 crops commonly grown in greenhouses in australia include tomato capsicum eggplant and cucumber ausveg 2019a nevertheless most greenhouses up to 80 in australia are low cost structures with soil grown crops parks et al 2009 ausveg 2019b nguyen 2019 though the number of high technology structures on soilless growing media has been increasing in recent years to meet specific market requirements ausveg 2019b nguyen 2019 high tech greenhouses could be five to ten times more expensive than low cost soil based greenhouses nguyen 2019 therefore in the northern adelaide plains most growers do not have the capital required to construct high tech greenhouses and instead choose to use low cost systems where risk levels are lower water availability and quality are the most important factors that determine the expansion of protected agriculture it is well understood that greenhouse crops cannot be grown profitably with highly saline water stanghellini et al 2007 to manage both water quantity and quality many irrigators have to make use of several water sources which are either conventional surface and groundwater or non conventional recycled wastewater desalinated water brackish water treated produced water from oil and gas production etc various qualities of different water sources add a higher level of complexity to irrigation water management and their use poses a new challenge to managers and irrigators reca et al 2018 therefore in many arid and semiarid regions salinization of soil and water resources is increasing in protected horticulture pardossi et al 2004 machado and serralheiro 2017 since most crops including vegetables grown in soil based greenhouses are highly sensitive to salinity the knowledge of salinity build up in soil is important for optimal irrigation management stanghellini et al 2007 similarly in the northern adelaide plains nap region of south australia yields of soil grown tomato and cucumber crops have been steadily declining for several years due to high salinity high sodium and chloride levels in the soil ferguson et al 2012 the reason for the decline was found to be the poor quality of primary water sources which was either saline bore or recycled water with an ec of 2 4 ds m due to limited storage capacity only a minimal amount of rainwater was captured from greenhouse roofs that could be blended with irrigation water to dilute its salinity likewise shi et al 2009 observed high accumulation of soil nutrients which led to higher soil salinity in long term greenhouse cultivations some nutrients that accumulate in the root zone may leach downward with the application of irrigation water causing soil and groundwater contamination colombani et al 2015 kim et al 2008 most greenhouse farmers follow irrigation and fertigation practices based on their experiences thompson et al 2007 without monitoring or controlling the soil water nutrient and salt status therefore accurate estimations of crop water requirements are needed to avoid either salt build up in the soil profile or excess water applications that would negatively impact nutrient availability for plants and leaching of agrochemicals to groundwater blanco and folegatti 2004 effective irrigation scheduling in closed growing structures depends on accurate estimates of crop evapotranspiration etc however direct measurement methods of crop water requirements e g weighing lysimeters stem gauges are either expensive or may not be practical to implement in commercial greenhouse settings villarreal guerrero et al 2012 alternatively simulation models offer cost effective and non destructive approaches to estimate crop water use among such models the fao 56 methodology allen et al 1998 has been used worldwide to determine crop water requirements under open field conditions and this methodology can also be applied to greenhouse crops bonachela et al 2006 qiu et al 2015 to use the fao 56 methodology for greenhouse crops measurements of greenhouse reference evapotranspiration et0 and crop coefficients kc are required fernández et al 2010 möller and assouline 2007 observed that daily et0 in a cropped greenhouse calculated following the fao 56 methodology averaged only about 62 of the estimated outdoor value the main reason for the reduction in et0 compared to outdoors was a significant reduction in solar radiation inside the greenhouse 56 of open field conditions and lower wind speeds which decrease the exchange of water vapor between the crop canopy and greenhouse atmosphere farias et al 1994 observed that et0 inside greenhouses was always 45 77 lower than outside braga and klar 2000 observed that et0 values inside greenhouses oriented east west and north south were 85 and 80 respectively of outdoor et0 however harmanto et al 2005 found that etc estimated using measured climate data in a greenhouse was about 75 80 of etc observed in an open environment several software packages such as prho v2 0 fernandez et al 2009 and vegsyst gallardo et al 2011 2016 have been developed that are based on the fao 56 method with a single kc approach and that simulate etc crop growth and crop n uptake of greenhouse grown vegetable crops due to the complexity involved in measuring climate variables and crop data such as the leaf area index other simple methods for accurately estimating greenhouse et0 that use for example the temperature based hargreaves equation fernández et al 2010 have been explored empirical approaches widely used under open field conditions that only require temperature and greenhouse radiation data allen et al 1998 itenfisu et al 2003 gavilán et al 2006 could be easily applied for determining greenhouse et0 boulard and wang 2000 nikolaou et al 2017 found a good correlation between leaf temperature and transpiration for a soilless greenhouse cucumber crop with the prediction equation being validated for different greenhouse climatic conditions however such irrigation practices have often oversimplified the complex nature of the interacting climate soil and crop variables involved in the estimation of crop water requirements for example irrigation scheduling for greenhouse crops based on outdoor temperature is practiced by growers in the nap who consider only 60 of outdoor etc awad et al 2019 while this simplified approach requires less data there is a need to test its effectiveness for long term irrigation while also safeguarding chemical quality of soil observations of soil health over one or several seasons won t reveal the potential adverse impacts of irrigation induced salinity and sodicity which usually arise only after many years of inappropriate irrigation scheduling hence there is the need for long term simulations that incorporate the soil processes that can lead to accumulation of various salts in the soil profile e g mallants et al 2017 processed based numerical models are excellent tools to enhance our understanding of the long term impact of irrigation on salinity e g phogat et al 2018 and sodicity risks in the receiving environment among these models the multi component major ion chemistry module unsatchem of the hydrus 1d software package šimůnek et al 2016 is an excellent tool intended to predict major ion chemistry as well as water and solute fluxes in soils during transient conditions while the water flow and solute transport components of the standard hydrus 1d model have been used widely e g phogat et al 2018 applications of the major ion chemistry module have been limited because of its complexity and a lack of appropriate experimental data e g gonçalves et al 2006 ramos et al 2011 however several short term studies mainly focused on assessing the impact of using high sar water suarez et al 2006 sodic soil reclamation simunek and suarez 1997 kaledhonkar et al 2006 wang et al 2014 water quality requirements mallants et al 2017 and solute transport ramos et al 2011 under irrigation with saline degraded water skaggs et al 2014 therefore simulations of the movement of dissolved solutes and precipitation dissolution reactions of salts in soils have been a useful complement to experimental data suarez 2001 also computer modelling may help assess the viability of different water uses such as blending and test the efficacy of soil amelioration methods applications with the major ion chemistry module unsatchem of hydrus 1d for assessing long term risks of irrigation with recycled water and associated blends and reclamation options for greenhouse crops are limited in this study we evaluate the impact of the long term 2018 2050 use of irrigation water blended from waters of different qualities recycled water managed aquifer recharge mar water and harvested rainwater on soil chemical changes for soil grown crops under greenhouse conditions we explore various management options such as increased leaching fractions and annual gypsum applications to avoid excessive build up of soil salinity and sodicity we additionally also seek to identify how to make the best use of blended water for sustainable irrigation in the nap region finally we also implement a new capability into the unsatchem module allowing an annual application of a solid form of gypsum in order to reduce the exchangeable sodium percentage esp levels in the soils the outcome of these long term simulations accounting for future climate predictions would help in devising better irrigation guidelines for growing vegetable crops under protected environments while also accommodating higher water needs owing to a future hotter climate 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and soil parameters the northern adelaide plain nap region is one of the important greenhouse crop growing areas in australia due to its flat topography existing agricultural and horticultural infrastructure and access to an urban market the nap is well suited for irrigated annual horticulture in the last decade 220 commercial establishments have emerged in the nap showing a 38 growth in greenhouse cropped area pirsa spatial information services 2017 however fresh water is a key input which influences crop yield and soil degradation the region experiences a mediterranean climate characterized by hot dry summers and cool to cold winters long term 1900 2016 average rainfall in the region is 475 mm department of environment water and natural resources 2016 and annual evapotranspiration is 1308 mm resulting in the need for irrigation for crop production soil samples for this study were collected in triplicates from two greenhouses in the region awad et al 2019 at two depths 0 20 and 20 30 cm these samples were analyzed for their physico chemical properties following standard procedures mallants et al 2019 the soil texture in the first greenhouse s1 is categorized as sandy clay loam at both depths with sand silt and clay contents varying from 47 9 to 62 2 12 9 23 4 and 23 4 31 5 respectively similarly the soil texture of the second greenhouse s2 was categorized as sandy loam at both depths the organic carbon oc content varied from 0 77 to 1 06 in s1 while it was nearly double 1 38 1 97 in the second soil s2 average soil water contents at saturation 0 01 kpa and at 4 8 33 60 100 and 1500 kpa and the saturated hydraulic conductivity table 1 of the two soils were fitted using the van genuchten mualem analytical model van genuchten 1980 to obtain soil hydraulic parameters for the unsatchem module table 1 soil chemical parameters required by the unsatchem module include the gapon exchange constants the initial concentrations of soil exchangeable cations k na ca2 mg2 and the initial solution composition k na ca2 mg2 alkalinity so4 2 cl in the soil profile the latter was defined using the solution composition of harvested rainwater collected in the greenhouses in the nap region table 2 awad et al 2019 exchangeable cations were determined using nh4cl solution at either ph 7 0 or ph 8 5 depending on the soil ph rayment and lyons 2011 the cation exchange capacity cec was assumed to be equal to the sum of adsorbed concentrations of the four cations na ca2 mg2 and k and it was assumed that the cec 107 4 161 5 meq kg soil is constant and ph independent notably the esp varied from 9 52 to 16 61 which was much higher than the threshold value 6 for australian conditions gapon constants were taken from mallants et al 2019 who estimated these values for similar soils in the nap region values of soil exchangeable cations and gapon constants for both soils used in the modeling simulations are shown in table 3 soil hydraulic table 1 and chemical properties table 3 measured in the 20 30 cm soil layer were assumed to extend to 200 cm the domain depth as the soils had almost uniform texture below 20 cm 2 2 unsatchem and its gypsum module the study focussed on long term simulations 1970 2050 using hydrus 1d with the unsatchem module šimůnek et al 2016 for evaluating the impact of the use of irrigation water blended from different water sources recycled water managed aquifer recharge mar and harvested rainwater for irrigation of crops grown under greenhouses conditions unsatchem is a multi component major ion chemistry module which is particularly well suitable for quantitative predictions of processes involving major ions such as simulations of the effects of salinity on plant growth and estimating the amount of water and amendments required to reclaim soil profiles to desired levels of salinity and esp šimůnek et al 2016 different components of the hydrus 1d model which are applicable for this study are described comprehensively in šimůnek et al 2013 and šimůnek et al 2016 the form of the one dimensional richards equation that is solved in hydrus 1d by the galerkin type linear finite element scheme assumes that the air phase plays an insignificant role in the liquid flow process and that water flow due to thermal gradients can be neglected šimůnek et al 2013 the single porosity van genuchten mualem model šimůnek et al 2016 was used in this study the major ion chemistry module in hydrus 1d enables the simulation of equilibrium

suffering from increased sodicity esp due to the prolonged use of irrigation waters of low quality high esp develops as a result of dynamic chemical exchanges between the solution and the solid phase after the application of irrigation water of high sodium adsorption ratio sar 2 3 irrigation inputs and crop parameters a survey by awad et al 2019 found that four crops tomato capsicum cucumber and eggplant are commonly grown under greenhouse conditions in the nap the growing season for these crops in the nap starts in january and lasts until the end of september november may and november for tomato capsicum cucumber and eggplant respectively growers schedule irrigation events based on their own experience the growth stage of various crops and air temperature awad et al 2019 from information provided by growers the following temperature threshold values and ranges were identified for scheduling of different irrigation frequencies temperature 20 c temperature between 20 c 25 c temperature between 25 c 30 c temperature between 30 c 35 c and temperature 35 c with irrigation frequencies of once per week every 4th day 3 times per week every second day and daily respectively utilizing the information provided by the growers awad et al 2019 developed a simple model iq qc2 which estimates daily irrigation requirements of crops and allows the mixing of different available water qualities the model adopted a temporally uniform 0 6 factor to convert open field crop evapotranspiration etc to greenhouse water requirement of the crops monthly kc values for tomato cucumber capsicum and eggplant used in the iq qc2 mixing model were taken from fao 56 allen et al 1998 average seasonal etc of all crops evaluated by iq qc2 matched the temperature based irrigation schedule adopted by the local growers therefore we adopted the daily irrigation application output from iq qc2 for the long term unsatchem simulations for each crop the average annual irrigation amount over the modeling period 1970 2050 predicted by iq qc2 amounted to 490 12 654 16 312 8 and 667 16 mm for tomato capsicum cucumber and eggplant respectively apart from daily crop water requirements iq qc2 also generates the associated water quality parameters based on the usage of available waters for irrigation such as recycled water harvested rainwater and artificially recharged groundwater the iq qc2 tool also calculates roof runoff water capture based on the roof area m2 and available storage capacity m3 this was done to reduce the required storage size and subsequently to increase the total volume of runoff that could be captured if two sources of water are available e g reclaimed water and artificially recharged groundwater the source that has the lower salinity level measured as tds value is used first when the required volume is less than the volume licensed for this source otherwise the other source the source with a higher salinity level is used water qualities used in this modeling study are given in table 3 water quality data represents the median water quality of treated sewage water at the bolivar plant mar water from the salisbury storage recovery well and the harvested rainwater from greenhouse roofs awad et al 2019 concentrations of all chemical constituents of blended water k na ca2 mg2 alkalinity so4 2 cl are estimated by iq qc2 as weighted averages of constituent concentrations of each water used monthly averaged blended irrigation water quality data thus obtained from iq qc2 for multiple years was used in unsatchem table 4 other crop specific inputs such as root water uptake parameters feddes et al 1978 were obtained from the hydrus database parameters for the salinity threshold slope functions for tomato capsicum and cucumber were taken from maas and hoffman 1977 and for eggplant from heuer et al 1986 the two parameters for these functions i e the threshold ece ds m and slope yield reduction per ds m for tomato capsicum cucumber and eggplant were 2 5 ds m and 9 9 1 5 ds m and 14 2 5 ds m and 13 and 1 1 ds m and 6 9 respectively the maximum rooting depth was assumed as 1 m for all crops which falls within the range of 0 7 1 2 0 5 1 0 0 7 1 2 and 0 7 1 2 m for tomato capsicum cucumber and eggplant respectively as reported by allen et al 1998 2 4 climate parameters climate parameters for the etc estimation were required for two periods the first one is a 48 year warming up period from january 1970 to december 2017 for each crop to attain equilibrium conditions for the soil water and chemical balance while the second one is the actual 33 year impact assessment period from january 2018 to december 2050 data for the first period were obtained from the bureau of meteorology station at edinburgh 34 71 s 138 62 e bom station number 023083 while data for the second period were based on downscaled climate projections i e median future climate for edinburgh by the general circulation model gfdl esm2m at rcp representative concentration pathway 4 5 charles and fu 2015 rainfall and soil evaporation were not considered in the simulations as these are controlled by the presence of closed growing structures greenhouse 2 5 modeling domain and initial and boundary conditions a uniform 2 m domain was considered for all crops tomato capsicum cucumber and eggplant with two distinct layers 0 15 and 15 to 200 cm the initial time step of 0 0001 d the minimum time step of 1 10 5 d and the maximum time step of 0 1 d were used in this study one hundred and one finite element nodes were generated for the 200 cm soil domain using a lower density 0 5 in the surface layer 15 cm and a higher density 1 at deeper depths the root density was assumed to decrease linearly from the soil surface to the maximum rooting depth of 1 m the initially uniform pressure head 100 cm condition was assumed while the initial solution composition was assumed to be equilibrated with the rainwater composition the measured exchange composition and cec were used in different soil layers table 2 to simulate water movement the surface boundary condition was specified as an atmospheric boundary with the maximum surface water layer of 5 cm i e whenever irrigation exceeds the soil s infiltration capacity water ponds at the soil surface and infiltrates overtime when irrigation stops a free drainage bc was imposed at the bottom of the soil profile zero precipitation was considered by the model for protected crop conditions however irrigation amounts estimated by the iq qc2 model awad et al 2019 for each crop was assumed as a time variable flux applied at the top boundary for solute transport the concentration flux boundary condition was selected for the upper boundary condition for the lower boundary condition the zero gradient boundary condition is the most appropriate particularly when water flow is directed out of the modeled domain šimůnek et al 2013 initially the model was warmed up for 48 years from 1970 till 2018 under historical climate with an estimated irrigation schedule for each crop and rainwater composition table 2 discussed in section 2 3 to establish a quasi equilibrium between the soil solution and the soil exchange complex subsequently a monthly varied average irrigation quality table 4 obtained from the iq qc2 model awad et al 2019 was applied during the irrigation application to each crop 2 6 modeling scenarios initially a base scenario was run for each crop tomato capsicum cucumber and eggplant using an irrigation schedule for unheated greenhouse cultivation used by the growers in the nap awad et al 2019 and other inputs described above although the initial soil esp was higher than the australian standard esp 6 a base scenario for each crop was performed to compare the efficacy of management scenarios on the reduction of the salinity and sodicity hazards relative to the base scenario the model was then run for numerous management scenarios developed based on the outcome of the initial scenario these scenarios included 4 leaching fractions lf in of excess water applied i e lf0 0 lf0 15 15 lf0 2 20 and lf0 3 30 and four annual gypsum applications i e g0 0 meq kg soil or 0 t ha g10 10 meq kg soil or 1 7 t ha g15 15 meq kg soil or 2 6 t ha and g20 20 meq kg or 3 4 t ha no gypsum was applied during the warming up period 1970 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 water balance components model simulated water balance components obtained for the base scenarios reflecting current farmers irrigation practices for different greenhouse crops are shown in fig 1 the annual values of root water uptake for all crops are close to their average annual irrigation applications 490 2 653 8 667 6 and 311 6 mm for tomato capsicum eggplant and cucumber respectively average annual root water uptake across all years by tomato capsicum eggplant and cucumber was 476 642 649 and 303 mm respectively however the corresponding average drainage component was only 4 6 5 4 6 1 and 4 1 of the total irrigation application respectively such low values are below the recommended leaching fraction lf needed to flush accumulated salts from the crop root zone typically open field crop irrigation designs require a 10 20 higher water application for salinity control depending on the crop soil and water quality hoffman and shannon 2007 in some cases this fraction can be higher than 20 if climate and soil encourage salinity build up in the soils and when crops are highly sensitive to salinity hoffman and shannon 2007 rhodes and loveday 1990 suggested a leaching fraction of 20 50 as ideal value for such conditions including for irrigation with recycled water as the leaching fraction is dependent on local conditions of soil climate and crop the determination of the minimum leaching requirement was undertaken in this study as one of the management scenarios 3 2 soil ph and salinity ecsw dynamics under different crops simulated annual values of ph and ecsw for base scenarios for different crops are shown in fig 2 for both soils s1 and s2 the subsequent discussion is based on the results for soil s1 while those for s2 are very similar the ph values decreased gradually although the magnitude of the reduction was very small less than 5 these changes in soil ph were expected due to the lower ph of irrigation water 6 95 7 4 table 2 as compared to the initial soil solution 8 4 8 7 which gradually brought down the soil ph to achieve a quasi equilibrium at the end of the simulation in the year 2050 the average ph values in the soils varied in a narrow range 8 1 8 4 for all crops the final ph depends on the amount of irrigation water showing the lowest ph for crops receiving the most water capsicum and eggplant the highest ph is for the crop receiving the least water cucumber with the ph for tomato in between on the other hand there was a similarly sharp increase in the profile average ecsw values under all crops the ecsw build up was the lowest under cucumber followed by tomato these results are consistent with the lower amounts of seasonal irrigation applied to those two crops meanwhile the highest annual ecsw was observed for capsicum and eggplant this is the result of the higher irrigation application for these crops and a longer cropping season jan to oct nov as compared to cucumber jan may and tomato jan sept the profile average ecsw in year 2050 rose to 6 5 7 6 8 7 and 9 3 ds m for cucumber tomato capsicum and eggplant respectively these values are above the salinity tolerance thresholds ecsw was derived from published ece values as ecsw 2 ece for these crops i e 5 5 3 4 and 2 ds m respectively maas and hoffman 1977 sonneveld and vogt 2009 bonachela et al 2018 observed that mean ec of the soil solution extracted by suction cups under a greenhouse tomato crop ranged between 6 7 ds m which is similar to the results obtained in the current study whether these salinity levels were the result of farmers over irrigating to overcome the salinity problem was not known as leaching practices were not well documented bonachela et al 2018 however soil salinization mostly depends on the amount of applied saline water meiri 1984 shalhevet 1994 therefore a leaching fraction should be applied well ahead of the salt accumulation in the root environment reaching hazardous levels meiri 1984 shalhevet 1994 or the evaporative demand increases fernández et al 2010 due to climate variability and or change therefore a soil with continued high salinity values above crop thresholds can create considerable osmotic impacts which reduces crop water uptake and renders the soil unfit for crop production on the other hand soilless production systems typically adopt a large leaching fraction 30 40 bonachela et al 2018 which is a fundamental management consideration for these growing systems to maintain the salinity of the root zone solution at levels which are not detrimental to the optimal crop production sonneveld 2000 to avoid problems caused by the accumulation of salts a sizable proportion of the applied nutrient solution has to be drained leading to the so called drain to waste system van os 1995 therefore soilless systems such as hydroponics are associated with a substantial loss of water and can potentially represent a major input of salts and agrochemicals to groundwater if untreated discharge occurs 3 3 soil esp and sar dynamics under different crops similarly annual average sar and esp values for base scenarios in the greenhouse soils also showed an increasing trend for all crops fig 2 initial in 2018 average sar in the soil solution varied from 1 to 1 9 in s1 under different crops and increased by 2 2 1 8 1 7 and 1 8 times till 2050 under tomato capsicum cucumber and eggplant crops respectively similarly sar values in sandy loam soil s2 also showed a rapid increase 1 8 to 2 8 times during 33 years of irrigation with blended water the final values of sar in 2050 in sandy clay loam s1 soil ranged from 2 6 to 5 1 while the corresponding vales in sandy loam s2 soil varied from 3 3 6 6 likewise the esp values in sandy clay loam scl soil s1 at the end of the simulation the year 2050 were 30 8 27 1 31 4 and 33 2 under tomato capsicum cucumber and eggplant respectively the initial esp values 9 5 16 6 table 3 in the soil were also high they had gradually increased over the model initial equilibration period 1970 2018 and varied for different crops in response to the amount of irrigation water applied an increase in esp during 33 years of cropping 2018 2050 in absolute values ranged from 9 to 11 which was an increase of 39 55 compared to the corresponding values during 2018 a rapid increase in esp leads to values much higher than the critical esp 6 which can lead to the development of sodic soils under australian conditions northcote and skene 1972 it can worsen the sodicity risk in the existing sodic soils similar changes in soil ph ecsw sar and esp were also observed in the sandy loam soil s2 for all crops fig 2 dot points however the magnitude of these parameters was different for different crops a strong logarithmic relationship was observed between sarsw and esp in both soils fig 3 initially esp increased by a factor of two or more when sarsw risen from 2 to 6 subsequently the esp build up occurred at a lower rate and reached a similar value as sar for sarsw of 18 19 esp then decreased with a further increase in sarsw numerous studies have attempted to establish relations between sariw sar of irrigation water sare sar of the saturation extract and esp of the soils in different parts of the world ussl staff 1954 paliwal and gandhi 1976 shainberg et al 1980 ghafoor et al 1988 evangelou and marsi 2003 seilsepour et al 2009 chi et al 2011 observed similar logarithmic relations between esp vs sare and esp vs sar1 5 as in our study and found insignificant differences between the two contrary the higher esp build up at lower sarsw levels observed in our study differed from an almost linear relation up to sar 40 in some other studies e g ussl 1954 paliwal and gandhi 1976 ghafoor et al 1988 however most of these relations were based on sar of irrigation water sariw which is different from sar of soil solution sarsw normally the salt concentration in soils is highly dynamic and much higher than the salt concentration in irrigation water which may have affected the impact of the interaction between solution and exchange phases ussl 1954 interestingly rengasamy et al 1984 observed for the australian surface soils 0 15 cm linear relation between sar1 5 and esp esp 1 95 and sar1 5 1 8 which is similar to our current study with lower sarsw values up to 6 subsequently stevens et al 2003 extended this relation for nap soils by including the data from the 0 100 cm soil depth and found a curvilinear rather than linear relation thus it is clear that approximate relationships between sar and esp vary with site specific clay contents mineralogy salinity of the equilibrium solution and the saturation percentage of the soil solution the data in fig 3 further reveals that sarsw of 2 3 can potentially lead to the development of esp higher than given the value provided by the australian standard esp 6 for the development of sodicity hazards in the soil rengasamy et al 1984 also suggested that a sar 1 5 soil water ratio larger than 3 is associated with clay dispersion crusting and reduced porosity in similar soils however they found a strong correlation between clay dispersion and both sar and the total cation concentration tcc in another study rengasamy and marchuk 2011 proposed an alternative ratio cross to sar it includes other cations mg2 and k that can induce dispersive soil behavior which is critical for characterizing the structural stability of the soils however we understand that different cations e g na k and mg2 have different effects on clay dispersion in different soils and that these effects depend on all inherent soil characteristics which affect the biogeochemical dynamics of the soil solution and soil exchange these results suggest that an irrigation schedule for greenhouse crops in the nap region without a significant leaching fraction and or gypsum addition appears not to suffice to avoid the buildup of salinity and sodicity in the soil therefore there is a need to improve irrigation scheduling with an appropriate leaching fraction lf as well as with regular applications of a suitable amount of gypsum g for controlling salinity and sodicity these management scenarios will be discussed next alternatively an application of soluble ca as part of irrigation can also help in keeping esp under control however rapid leaching of soluble ca or its likely precipitation in the soil as calcite at high ph may reduce the effectiveness of added soluble ca 3 4 management scenarios additional scenarios were performed with different leaching fractions lf0 15 lf0 2 and lf0 3 and annual gypsum applications g10 g15 g20 for tomato the results show that an increased leaching fraction without additions of gypsum produces a small increase in soil ph fig 4 gypsum additions at an annual rate of 10 meq kg soil g10 1 7 t ha combined with any non zero leaching fraction reduced soil ph at all depths by 7 5 9 4 however a further increase in the gypsum application g15 g20 regardless of leaching fractions had only a small impact on subsequent reductions 0 4 0 8 in soil ph overall average ph had been reduced to 7 7 7 8 which is a suitable range for an optimal nutrient availability for crops roques et al 2013 therefore an annual gypsum application of 10 meq kg soil 1 7 t ha combined with lf 0 15 lf 0 3 seems adequate for maintaining soil ph within a suitable range 6 0 8 0 similarly the ecsw in the soil decreased below the tomato threshold ecsw 5 ds m for all non zero lfs which suggests that a minimum lf of 0 15 is adequate to maintain the soil salinity below the threshold fig 4 as expected applications of gypsum increased the soluble ion concentration in the soil leading to an increase in the ecsw at all depths although it was still below the crop threshold it is worth noting that increasing the lf alone didn t reduce sar and esp in the soil to acceptable levels clearly these impairments require additional soil amendments such as applications of gypsum to reduce their impact on soils and crops the results show that an addition of gypsum at an annual rate of 10 meq kg soil 1 7 t ha along with a leaching fraction lf of 0 15 reduced sar and esp below thresholds within the top 30 cm soil depth however this combination was unable to lower sar and esp below threshold levels at the 60 90 cm depth a further increase in gypsum additions to 15 g15 and 20 meq kg g20 combined with a leaching fraction lf of 0 15 also did not further reduce sar and esp in the soil at deeper depths only when a minimum lf of 0 2 was combined with an annual addition of gypsum of at least 10 meq kg soil 1 7 t ha did average sar and esp drop below thresholds at greater soil depths other scenarios were also explored in which leaching fractions less than 0 15 were used together with different gypsum additions g10 g15 and g20 while ecsw dropped below its thresholds these scenarios were unable to lower esp below the critical threshold data not shown therefore it is suggested that for shallow rooted soil grown vegetables in the nap region additions of gypsum at a rate of 10 t ha with an lf of 0 15 is able to keep the soil free from the salinity and sodicity build up under greenhouse conditions on the other hand for deep rooted crops a combination of an lf of 0 2 with an annual gypsum addition of 10 meq kg soil or higher would contribute to maintaining a sustainable production under long term greenhouse conditions time series of profile average ph ecsw sar and esp values obtained for lfs of 0 and 0 2 and different annual gypsum additions 0 10 15 meq kg soil for tomato are shown in fig 5 the scenario with g10 and 0 2 l f had initial average profile esp values higher than the threshold esp 6 these esp values then gradually decreased to values similar to those obtained for the scenario with annual additions of gypsum of 15 meq kg soil g15 at the end of the simulation in the year 2050 similarly average sar values initially increased and subsequently decreased below the threshold ph was reduced by 8 7 to an average value around 7 8 and ecsw was much lower than the tomato tolerance threshold 5 ds m similar results were obtained for the sandy loam soil s2 with cucumber fig 6 apparently the amount of irrigation 312 mm for cucumber versus 490 mm for tomato and soil properties also influenced the effectiveness of lf and gypsum additions for reclaiming the soils other factors such as purity of gypsum particle size uniformity of application and mixing in the soil also influence the effectiveness of gypsum in reducing esp in the soil were not evaluated in this study overall the results from the current modeling study suggest that a long term irrigation schedule without significant leaching fraction may lead to salinity and sodicity problems there is clearly a need to apply a leaching fraction of 15 20 for leaching the salts below the crop root zone even blended water used for irrigation has a strong tendency to build up sodicity in the soil therefore annual applications of gypsum at 1 7 2 6 t ha or preferably based on a soil test or similar ca amounts from other sources should be applied to overcome the sodicity hazard in the soil the survey conducted by awad et al 2019 found that many growers apply annually organics compost and ca through nutrient solutions both of these additions help in alleviating sodicity hazards in the soil however continued monitoring of the salinity and sodicity status of the soil is an essential aspect of soil management that allows one to intervene well before issues occur the results obtained from the current study are specific for the considered crops soils climate and water qualities several other factors involved in growing protected crops were not considered in this study such as different substrates effects of ventilation and evaporative cooling these factors can also impact the water use and its management and related issues such as salinity and sodicity developments the concentration of nutrients the quality of soil substrate and local issues such as leachate management may also impact the plant water requirement and its effective management simulation tools such as those used in this study can account for these additional conditions and thus help develop guidelines for practitioners aimed at maintaining sustainable production systems 4 conclusions protected agriculture is a popular cultivation system especially for vegetable crops these are highly efficient systems in term of the consumption of energy and other inputs such as water and fertilizers however suitable water is often scarce in regions where these production systems exist such as in the vicinity of urban arid or semi arid environments therefore in most cases low quality water is used directly or in combination with other available water resources such as harvested rainwater unfortunately low quality waters are often used without knowing the harmful impacts on crop productivity soil health and the wider environment this study used the multi component major ion chemistry module unsatchem of the hydrus 1d model to evaluate the effects of long term 2018 2050 irrigation with blended water for a range of soil grown crops under unheated greenhouse conditions the results revealed that irrigation schedules for future climate projections that do not apply a significant leaching fraction might lead to a high salt build up and esp development in the soil the soil solution salinity ecsw can increase to 6 5 9 ds m at year 2050 and esp can rise to 27 33 for all crops considered these conditions could render the soil unfit for crop production and could potentially degrade the associated environment therefore appropriate management options should be implemented to keep the irrigation induced harmful impacts under control the study evaluated the efficacy of increased leaching and gypsum additions to control salinity and sodicity for this purpose the unsatchem module was extended with a new capability to allow annual gypsum applications management scenarios with different leaching fractions for salinity control showed that 15 20 more water per irrigation would be required to keep the salinity under control for soil grown greenhouse vegetables results obtained in various scenarios with irrigation waters with high sar and esp suggest that annual gypsum application at a rate of 1 7 t ha together with a leaching fraction of at least 20 was adequate for managing this hazard in other words management options that implement both a significant leaching fraction and gypsum amendments are required finally the long term monitoring of highly efficient greenhouse production systems is essential for early identification of irrigation induced soil salinity and other associated issues declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments authors acknowledge the financial support by

10821,this study develops a methodology to assess the comparative advantages of new methods to plan irrigation with respect to prevailing existing irrigation practices the methodology consists of a comparative cost benefit analysis based on the value of information approach that makes it possible to analyse whether an improvement in the information available to farmers generates economic benefits the method is applied to the problem of comparing computer irrigation models providing irrigation advice based on measurements water balance models and weather predictions and prevailing irrigation practices at times based on soil and plant observations or on advanced technologies in estimating and predicting crop water requirements in pilot experiments located in four different european regions the results reveal that the introduction of the alternative method improves the performance of irrigation practices in mediterranean regions that are characterised by high weather variability and for those crops for which the consequences of failing to meet predictions are relatively low i e tomato instead of maize drip irrigated crops instead of sprinkler irrigated crops under favourable conditions the use of the alternative technology generates a 0 20 increase in gross margin and a 10 30 water saving with respect to prevailing existing irrigation practices the study concludes by addressing the conditions that justify the use of advanced information systems to schedule irrigation interventions and by offering some policy recommendations to drive their uptake these include subsidising research at the evaluation stage and public investments aimed at knowledge creation weather and shallow water table monitoring stations and knowledge sharing counselling at the adoption stage keywords irrigation scheduling uncertainty value of information 1 introduction during the last decade the agricultural sector in europe has seen the introduction of information and communication technologies ict that have the potential to increase farmers access to public and private information improving among other aspects their efficiency in using water resources aker et al 2016 the recent diffusion of ict for agriculture in europe is favoured by the common agricultural policy cap which dedicates financial support to improve irrigation scheduling and to promote the dissemination of water saving irrigation techniques especially for water sensitive areas the adoption of computer irrigation models cims is sometimes a prerequisite for farmers to receive subsidies galioto et al 2017 cims provide messages to farmers about whether to irrigate and how much often through smartphones bartlett et al 2015 by coupling information from water balance models field sensors and weather forecasts increased interest from the scientific community in developing new cim technologies amongst the others corbari et al 2019 li et al 2018 nguyen et al 2017 has been documented worldwide but a clear understanding of the actual usage of cim technologies to plan irrigation interventions and the relevant impacts is still missing hence weakening arguments in favour of the public value of supporting their adoption galioto et al 2017 nakasone and torero 2016 this is because of the intangible nature of the product generated by these technologies namely information and because of the impossibility of checking whether farmers formally adopting cims are actually using them consequently the ambiguous performance of commercial cim technologies does not help public authorities in the design of adequate policy interventions to convey their proliferation therefore public authorities will at times provide incentives for the adoption when these technologies are not yet mature enough to be marketed with the result of failing both to increase farmers competitiveness and to trigger water saving practices bartlett et al 2015 from an economic point of view the decision by farmers to use cims to plan irrigation may be interpreted as dependent upon economic performance i e the comparison of the benefits identified as the value of information voi against costs most farmers will decide to adopt new management practices and begin to purchase and learn to use the technology only when they are convinced that the time and money spent are justified by improved yields or reduced costs or risk thus a farmer s decision to use a new information technology especially to plan irrigation starts from assessing the voi associated with it this value is influenced by the existing information status under which the farmer operates the type and quality of the additional information made available to the farmer and the consequences brought about by the use of the new information technology the objective of this paper is to develop and test a methodology to assess the comparative advantages of cims to plan irrigation with respect to prevailing existing irrigation practices this is a challenging issue due to the uncertainty surrounding the information produced by cims and due to incomplete knowledge of its effects the method is based on applying the voi approach bikhchandani et al 2013 to assess the extent to which an improvement in the quality of the available information justifies the change in the criteria used by the farmer to schedule irrigation the developed approach shows that better information does not necessarily imply changes in the criteria used to schedule irrigation the transition to new information sources is in fact conditioned by the expected benefits of using such information such benefits are influenced by elements that are both intrinsic to the technology itself such as the quality of the information provided and extrinsic namely the operational conditions under which the technology is implemented an empirical implementation of the method is also provided with the aim of investigating the factors that motivate investments in such type of technologies since the pioneering article of raiffa 1974 a number of scholars have introduced methodologies and empirical analyses similar to the one developed in this study in different fields of research bouma et al 2009 cavazza et al 2018 galioto et al 2017 lindner and gibbs 1990 liu et al 2008 yet there is limited literature available that applies the voi approach on issues related to water management cavazza et al 2018 galioto et al 2017 liu et al 2008 the existing literature highlights the potentialities of cims applied to the management of water resources both at the district level cavazza et al 2018 and at the irrigation plot level galioto et al 2017 liu et al 2008 in all cases the voi approach is used to evaluate the economic performance of new cims compared to the existing ones without really exploring how new information contributes to triggering changes in water management practices and most importantly without applying this approach to real case studies the methodology presented in this paper differs from previous studies both in the method and in the empirical implementation from a methodological perspective this study applies a voi approach to analyse the role played by information in influencing decision making disentangling the process of value creation brought about by the introduction of new pieces of information and providing a theoretical explanation of the conditions that might favour the use of new information technologies in the field of irrigation scheduling in addition the method is tested using data from field experiments in the framework of irrigation scheduling a practice particularly sensitive to the availability of information but not yet studied in the perspective offered by the present study thus the present study might contribute to fill existing gaps in the dedicated literature that to the best knowledge of the authors do not provide a clear understanding of the real benefits brought about by the introduction of cims in agriculture the remainder of the paper is organised as follows the literature review section 2 discusses how uncertainty is approached in the agricultural economic literature motivating the criterion used to assess the viability of new sources of information the methodology section 3 describes the assessment approach that was adopted while an empirical example is provided in section 4 where we compare different sources of information to schedule irrigation interventions at an experimental level section 5 discusses the main implications of the results obtained section 6 concludes whilst providing some policy recommendations and hints for further research on the topic 2 literature review lack of access to information is considered to be a major problem in the agricultural sector as it contributes to maintaining unsustainable agricultural practices and pressure on resources especially water resources nakasone and torero 2016 in fact a considerable number of studies in recent decades have analysed the management of water resources under uncertain information environments perry and narayanamurthy 1998 both at the district level anon 2014 chung et al 2009 das et al 2015 qin et al 2007 sabouni and mardani 2013 wang and huang 2012 and at the farm level carey and zilberman 2002 these studies support the idea that the natural variability of production not depending on the management of water resources hampers the adoption of advanced water supply and irrigation technologies because of the uncertain outcomes nevertheless in the real world the high risk of extreme outcomes triggers the adoption of advanced water supply and irrigation technologies the discrepancy between what is argued by the cited scholars and what is happening in the real world can find a possible explanation in the fact that such scholars did not explicitly include in their assessment methodology the adoption of information technologies such technologies contribute to influencing the perception of uncertain events by decision makers and consequently the decision maker s capacity to manage uncertain events in fact information helps farmers to develop strategies for mitigating the possibility of adverse events harwood et al 1999 when making decisions under uncertainty and risk there is the possibility of receiving different degrees of information prior to making the decision more information reduces the uncertainty and facilitates improved decision making the voi is used as a generic term for the increase in value resulting from better informed actions raiffa 1974 generally the greater the uncertainty of the outcome the higher the value of information additionally the more it will cost to use the information to make decisions the lower the price of the next best substitute for the information the lower the value of information laxminarayan and macauley 2012 to the best of our knowledge the voi approach has seldom been applied to the agricultural sector 1 1 the concept of the value of information has been applied in various fields such as economics finance medicine and engineering chiang and feng 2007 koerkamp et al 2006 furthermore the value of information has been estimated by different studies dealing with environmental resource management and disaster prevention bouma et al 2009 trigg and roy 2007 only few studies dealt with agriculture liu et al 2008 galioto et al 2017 cavazza et al 2018 a first attempt at applying the voi approach in agriculture was made by adams et al 1995 specifically they applied this approach to estimate the economic effects on agriculture of an improvement in the capacity to predict extreme weather events prior to the growing season in the southeastern us they found that increases in the accuracy of weather predictions have substantial economic value to agriculture making it possible to take precautionary measures with regard to land use hence mitigating damages more recently liu et al 2008 developed a methodology to assess the voi in precision farming specifically they developed a methodology to assess economic improvements in applying nutrients through variable rate application and a methodology to assess economic improvements in rationalizing land uses by applying technologies to discriminate management zones with different production potential later galioto et al 2017 applied the voi approach to assess the value generated by new irrigation technologies that improve information about soil characteristics and weather conditions based on simulation modelling cavazza et al 2018 developed a methodology based on the voi approach to evaluate how the combination of different information technologies contribute to influencing sequential decisions for the management of water resources at the district level based on simulation modelling however such studies do not provide any empirical evidence and the role played by information in improving farm performance in the field of precision farming is still unclear in fact there is no clear evidence that precision farming increases profit or decreases environmental impacts long et al 2016 the value of the information approach is particularly relevant when analysing decisions regarding water management cavazza et al 2018 and especially irrigation scheduling galioto et al 2017 the use of cims to schedule irrigation can increase irrigation efficiency this is because cims are supposed to offer better information about crops and their environment with the potential to help farmers in taking decisions closer to the optimal as the use of water and energy is concerned cims provide farmers with information about when and how much to irrigate coupling real time micro weather stations plant based sensors e g reflectance infrared temperatures or video and numerous real time soil water sensors scattered around the field at key locations to feed a set of predictive models cims potentially ensure higher economic returns principally by triggering a more rational use of inputs delgado and bausch 2005 hedley et al 2009 meisinger and delgado 2002 sadler et al 2005 tas et al 2016 and sometimes increasing yield and production quality cambouris et al 2014 fallahi et al 2010 2011 2015 montesano et al 2015 with respect to input uses scholars agree that the use of cims make it possible to save labour energy for pumping water water and fertilizer consumption moreover the possibility to differentiate the field in management zones can reduce the risk of having areas in the same field that are either too wet or too dry hence rationalizing the use of pumping energy and the consumption of water for irrigation li et al 2018 cims are also considered to be a primary management tool to reduce n leaching delgado and bausch 2005 meisinger and delgado 2002 nguyen et al 2017 and to minimize the need for continuous and expensive monitoring reducing labour efforts bartlett et al 2015 sadler et al 2005 with respect to crop production recent studies demonstrate that with irrigation scheduling services it is also possible to increase product quality recent results in this direction have been reported for tomatoes montesano et al 2015 potatoes cambouris et al 2014 and especially for fruit fallahi et al 2015 several studies have found that the magnitude of the benefit brought about by the use of water saving practices is conditioned by a number of factors especially the type of crop evett and schwartz 2011 the type of irrigation systems caswell and zilberman 1985 genius et al 2013 field characteristics sadler et al 2005 sunding and zilberman 1999 climate conditions sauer et al 2010 and the quality of information sadler et al 2005 usaid 2012 however farmers are often hesitant to use new practices to schedule irrigation and especially to drive irrigation by way of cims long et al 2016 this is because of different uncertainties regarding the economic value of better irrigation information in particular if the availability of irrigation water is also uncertain botes et al 1995 nguyen et al 2017 and due to the perception of more complicated management procedures and learning needs considered to increase transaction costs for the farm galioto et al 2017 these conditions substantiate the need to identify an appropriate methodology to evaluate whether an improvement in the quality of information to schedule irrigation introduced by the availability of new technologies justifies the use of such technologies 3 methodology 3 1 set up the approach presented here values the economic benefits of possible improvements in the quality of information to plan irrigation at what can be called the evaluation stage i e when the famer decides the type of information support to adopt for the scheduling of irrigation the method seeks inspiration and uses data from empirical experiments conducted in the framework of the european fp7 project figaro aimed at the development of new information tools to schedule irrigation further detail is provided in the next section in the figaro project the consortium developed a new cim technology to support irrigation scheduling to verify the marketability of the new technology the consortium ran a set of experiments to compare it with the prevailing irrigation practices in different regions in this respect in each experimental site the consortium identified a number of fields with similar characteristics similar soil texture morphology and size all of which were growing the same crops i e processing tomatoes maize etc and using the same irrigation technologies i e sprinkler drip etc for each experimental site irrigation was scheduled through the irrigation advice ia provided by the new cim technology on half of the fields and with the prevailing irrigation practice pi on the other half during the irrigation season the consortium monitored soil moisture before and after each irrigation intervention the amount of water applied for each irrigation intervention and the yield obtained in all experimental fields additional information on crop prices and unit irrigation costs from each experimental site was collected in this paper we use this information to develop two comparative approaches to assess the performance of the new technology the first one is a conventional cost benefit analysis to assess the relative performance of the new technology this is implemented using available information from the test fields the second step introduces an alternative assessment approach aimed at estimating accuracy thresholds about the new cim and providing a better understanding of the suitability of this tool depending on contextual production and climate conditions this makes it possible to underscore the role of information in the process of value creation it builds on the same information used above but also requires additional assumptions as the original information was not specifically collected for this purpose 3 2 comparative cost benefit analysis the collected information made it possible to compare differences in a small set of selected performance indicators i namely yield water uses and gross margins the difference between revenues and irrigation costs among the alternative irrigation scheduling systems to guarantee comparability across treatments we computed the following relative indicators for each performance parameter 1 r i i a i i i a i i p i 1 where r i i a is the relative performance of ia compared to pi for the i th performance indicator i i i a and i i p i are the i th performance indicators for the comparing irrigations scheduling systems when r i i a 0 there are no comparative advantages with the new technology ia perform better than pi if r i i a 0 for yield and the gross margin and if r i i a 0 for water uses the relative performance of the gross margin is influenced by the relative level of the other two indicators a higher yield affects gross margin positively through multiplication by the price higher water use affects it negatively through multiplication by the cost per cubic meter of irrigation water the compensation among indicators can in principle result in better performance for either pi or ia namely the positive economic performance of ia compared to pi is associated to increases in water use efficiency i e higher average productivity of water this does not necessarily imply water saving 3 3 comparative voi approach in this second step we refine and generalise the assessment approach presented above by developing a method to identify message accuracy thresholds that incorporate and operationalise the value of the information advice provided by the cim and compare it across decision support tools this value depends on the quality of information provided by the cim on the existing information environment under which the farmer operates and on the magnitude of the impacts associated with the decisions at stake the term quality of information in the present empirical framework is used as a synonym for the accuracy of the messages provided by the irrigation methods under comparison probability to correctly predict states in order to proceed we first have to better formalize the description of the decision problem by introducing the concept of messages states and actions messages represent the irrigation advice offered by a generic information service providing estimates about the probability of occurrence of states in the near future next decision making period states represent the different environmental conditions under which the crop is grown and that influence crop water requirements actions are the possible choices the farmer can make to satisfy crop water requirements without loss of generality and for the sake of simplicity we consider a binary representation of the problem with two messages irrigate and do not irrigate two states rain no rain and two actions irrigating and not irrigating messages actions and states occur into a sequential process where first the farmer receives a message from the information service second the farmer decides among a set of alternative actions third the farmer faces a set of alternative states depending on which the consequences of his actions pay off are determined thus following a backward induction process the farmer takes decisions and faces expected consequences on the basis of his expectation with respect to the existing information status of a comparable technology consistently with the voi approach we refer to the farmer s expectation as the farmer s expectation regarding the occurrence of forthcoming states that are conditional to the message received the sequential process described above is depicted by the decision tree in fig 1 for the message do not irrigate to formalize our problem we use the term m for a generic message supplied by the information service s for the occurrence of the state predicted by the message and s for the occurrence of the state not predicted by the message a for the action follow the message and a for the action do not follow the message in this framework a is coherent with m and a is not coherent with m likewise s is coherent with m and s is not coherent with m in addition we use the term p s m for the probability of occurrence of the state predicted by the message and p s m for the probability of occurrence of the state not predicted by the message and such that p s m p s m 1 if the information provided by the message is perfect p s m 1 and consequently p s m 0 for each message provided by the information service on the other hand if the information provided by the message is not perfect p s m 1 consequently p s m 0 finally we use the term l a s for the losses faced by the farmer when taking the right action and l a s for the losses faced by the farmer when taking the wrong action actions cause a loss when these are not consistent with states l a s 0 otherwise the loss is null l a s 0 the expected loss associated with each action taken by the farmer a a is then conditioned by her expectation about the likelihood of the upcoming states the value of the expected loss associated with each action is then obtained by the following equation 2a r a m l a s p s m l a s p s m m m 2b r a m l a s p s m l a s p s m m m where r a m is the expected loss associated with the action follow the message and r a m is the expected loss associated to the action do not follow the message the first term on the right hand side of eq 2a is null for the action follow the message and the second term on the right hand side of the eq 2b is null for the action do not follow the message because actions are coherent with states it is worthwhile to follow the message only if the expected losses associated with the action follow the message r a m are lower compared to the expected losses associated with the action do not follow the message r a m such that 3 r a m r a m o r p s m p s m l a s l a s o r p m l m 1 m m where pm is the relative error probability wrong predictions divided by right predictions about the occurrence of state s provided by the message m lm is the relative loss losses associated with the action do not follow the message l a s divided by losses associated with the action follow the message l a s when the ratio between the relative error probability and the relative loss p m l m is below 1 the expected loss associated with the action follow the message is lower than the expected loss associated with the action do not follow the message and messages can be considered accurate enough to drive decisions from the former eq 3 it is possible to calculate a reference accuracy threshold p s m the minimum probability to correctly predict events needed to justify the action follow the message 4 p s m p s m 1 p s m p s m l m a n d p s m 1 1 l m m m p s m is an inverse function of lm the value of p s m is high when lm is small and low when lm is high when the probability to correctly predict states is greater than the reference accuracy threshold p s m p s m it is worthwhile to follow the message fig 2 lm is zero if there are no consequences when disregarding the message that implicitly means that there are no rational reasons to take the action follow the message even though the message delivered by the new technology is extremely accurate in these extreme circumstances the reference accuracy threshold equals 1 based on common sense experience of economic parameters linked to irrigation yield and water uses it can be expected that the magnitude of the lm parameters are highly dependent on the type of message delivered by the new technology when the message is do not irrigate and the action is follow the message then the losses suffered when failing to meet the prediction are that the farmer is missing an irrigation intervention when irrigation is actually required with direct consequences on crop yield on the contrary when the message is irrigate and the action is follow the message then the losses suffered when failing to meet the prediction are that the farmer is misusing water when irrigation is actually not required with direct consequences on water uses and irrigation costs but not very much on yields except for very high amounts of water thus the relative loss is likely higher for the message do not irrigate and lower for the message irrigate that implies that higher accuracy is required to drive decisions for the messages to which higher losses are associated this is the message do not irrigate in our problem hence in light of the lm calculated from eq 5 for each message it can be expected that l d o n t i r r i g a t e l i r r i g a t e as a result p s d o n t i r r i g a t e p s i r r i g a t e in general the message service is more valuable if those messages to which higher losses are associated are accurate enough to drive decisions namely when p s d o n t i r r i g a t e p s d o n t i r r i g a t e the analysis made so far provides a rationale to assess if messages are accurate enough to be used to schedule irrigation the approach presented here reveals that the usability of the information technology under evaluation is influenced by factors that are both intrinsic the accuracy of the irrigation advice and extrinsic to the technology itself the magnitude of losses is influenced by factors such as crop type climate conditions and irrigation technologies while this is true for a single decision about irrigating comparing information technologies entails calculating the performances of the messages delivered across the whole season in our case the problem is to compare the performances obtained by scheduling irrigation through the information advice ia provided by a new cim technology with the performances obtained with existing prevailing irrigation practices pi in a given region ia performs better than pi if the following condition is satisfied 5 m 1 m p s r a m i a m 1 m p s r a m p i where the superscript ia and pi represent the comparing information sources the subscript m1 and m2 are the messages offered by the comparing information sources respectively irrigate and do not irrigate the subscript a1 and a2 are the actions that are coherent with the messages delivered by the comparing information sources the subscript s1 and s2 are the states need to irrigate and no need to irrigate this last step makes it possible to verify if the new cim technology is competitive with respect to the prevailing existing irrigation practices that is if it is capable of improving the quality of the information environment under which farmers operate in the following we introduce a case study in which we applied the methodologies developed thus far 4 an empirical application 4 1 data sources the methodology described in section 3 above was tested using the data collected in the context of the fp7 figaro project we compared two treatments a first treatment that followed a prevailing existing irrigation practice pi and a second treatment where irrigation was scheduled by means of the irrigation advice ia of the cim developed in the project the first is considered to be the benchmark strategy whereby irrigation is performed by checking the status of soil and vegetation conditions and using meteorological predictions provided by local meteorological stations and sometimes with recourse to additional soil water or weather information the latter incorporates advanced instruments such as local weather stations soil moisture sensors and agronomic models to estimate and predict crop water requirements in the near future during the irrigation season the comparison was performed for five different pedo climatic regions denmark south portugal south spain northern greece and northern italy and five major water demanding crops maize processing tomato cotton potatoes and citrus from 2013 to 2015 table 1 specifically 2 treatments one for pi and one for ia were carried out in each region over 2 consecutive years with the exception of the spanish and the portuguese region where the experiments where prolonged for an additional year each treatment was replicated once for the greek and portuguese regions twice for the italian region 3 times for the spanish region and 4 times for the danish region differences between ia and pi were estimated by comparing each replication of the alternative treatments for each experiment and year for example the presence of 1 replication per treatment makes it possible to perform only 1 comparison between the two treatments for each year of experiment this is the case of the greek and portuguese experiment the presence of 2 replications per treatment allows for 4 comparisons this is the case of the italian experiment the presence of 3 replications per treatment makes it possible to perform 9 comparisons this is the case of the spanish experiment and the presence of 4 replications per treatment allows for 16 comparisons this is the case of the danish experiment as a result we have 82 comparisons considering the whole period of field experiments of which 36 comparisons in 2013 and 2014 and 10 comparisons in 2015 experimental sites were selected following three key criteria 1 the existence of significant temporal variability in factors influencing irrigation interventions by cultivating summer crops 2 the presence of adequate equipment to monitor the status of water content in the soil soil moisture and plant sensors and 3 the direct control of crop management practices by the project staff in some cases field experiments were conducted on commercial farms such criteria did not guarantee perfect homogeneity in the selection of experiments indeed field experiments where selected by the project consortium members who in some cases relied on their own field experiments denmark and italy by using commercial sites and in other contracting the cultivation of specific crops with farmers portugal spain greece the crops selected for the comparison between ia and pi were chosen on the basis of their representativeness in the surrounding region of each experimental site the pi identified in each area was associated to 1 the most performing cim available in the region for experimental sites directly managed by the project staff 2 the practices used by the farmers directly cooperating in the experiments for the other sites specifically the danish experiment was carried out on experimental fields and the new cim technology was compared with an existing cim technology that is used to schedule irrigation for potatoes in the region daisy decision support system https daisy ku dk in italy the new cim technology was compared with irriframe the most popular decision support system used by farmers in the region to schedule irrigation https www irriframe it irriframe home index er for the other experimental sites the new cim technology developed in the project was compared with existing farm practices mainly based on farm experiences and local weather forecast thus the cim technology developed in the project was compared with different technologies under very different agro ecological conditions hence making it possible to assess the intrinsic value of the technology under heterogeneous real world conditions which allow for analyses of the circumstances under which the new technology is potentially capable of increasing the performance of the existing irrigation practices the experimental sites managed by contracting farmers where strictly monitored by the project staff for each experiment information was collected on soil moisture before and after irrigation using tensiometers scattered in each experimental field to estimate variations in the humidity level of the soil using the technologies under analysis water use by installing water meters at the pump outlet on each experimental site including commercial sites and monitoring the entire season in such a way as to obtain the precise number of irrigation interventions and the amount of water used per irrigation intervention for each season of treatment yield estimated by monitoring canopy growth which is useful to understand at which phenological stage water stress is suffered by the crop and then by sampling cropping areas at harvesting in addition information was collected on management practices specifically frequencies duration and amount of water applied for each irrigation intervention and on prices using a protocol developed by the authors specifically economic information on energy prices crop prices and labour costs collected using official statistical information when available from local statistical sources otherwise from the eurostat database http ec europa eu eurostat and the fao database http faostat fao org technological characteristics of the irrigation system including the hydraulic head of the pumping system the flow rate of the water delivered to the field the pumping efficiency and the power of the pump to estimate energy consumption per cubic meter of water applied man hours to equip each irrigation intervention number of irrigation intervention timeframe of each irrigation intervention scheduled through the protocol during the whole irrigating season the inconsistency of soil moisture measurements during the entire irrigation season in most of the experimental fields breakages errors of measurement etc made it such that it was not possible to assess water in excess and water at fault for the technologies being compared for this reason to implement the voi approach we relied on the information used to perform the cost benefit analysis on the number of irrigation interventions for each treatment and year and on the following assumptions needed to indirectly estimate the probability to wrongly predict events the target number of effective irrigation events n is set equal to the number of irrigation events of the best performing experimental plot for each experiment and each year of investigation the actual number of effective irrigation interventions for each experimental plot n s i r r i g a t e is set equal to the target number of effective irrigation interventions multiplied by the ratio between the yield obtained in the experimental plot and the maximum yield for each experiment and each year of investigation the total number of decision events n t is set equal to the ratio between the length of the irrigation season and the minimum period between two consecutive decision events for the whole period of investigation the information collected and the assumptions made allowed for a rough estimate of the quality of information from the technologies being compared which were used to drive irrigation interventions and of the associated impacts to implement the methodology developed here which is based on discrete choices whether or not to irrigate rather than how much to irrigate the number of missing irrigation interventions the absence of watering when irrigation is actually required for each treatment was computed by calculating the differences between the target number of effective irrigation interventions and the actual number of effective irrigation interventions between the technologies being compared this is formalized in the following equation 6 n s d o n t i r r i g a t e n n s i r r i g a t e eqs 6 to 9 are defined for each observation replication of each treatment being compared the subscript in brackets defines the message delivered to the farmer that in our study overlaps with the actions taken by the farmer in our experiment both messages rendered by ia and pi drive actions the number of missing irrigation interventions equals the difference between the target number of irrigation events and the actual number of effective irrigation interventions the number of irrigation interventions where the state no rain is coherent with the action irrigate furthermore the number of irrigation interventions where water is misused was calculated by computing the difference between the actual number of irrigation interventions and the actual number of effective irrigations carried out by the treatments being compared this is formalized by the following equation 7 n s i r r i g a t e n i r r i g a t e n s i r r i g a t e in eq 6 n s i r r i g a t e is for the number of irrigation interventions where water is misused the state rain is not coherent with the action irrigate this number equals the difference between total number of irrigation interventions made by the farmer and the number of irrigation interventions that are coherent with the state no rain finally the probability of wrongly predicting no need to irrigate was computed by the ratio of the number of missing irrigation interventions and the target number of effective irrigation interventions 8 p s d o n t i r r i g a t e n s d o n t i r r i g a t e n similarly the probability of wrongly predicting need to irrigate was obtained by the ratio of the number of irrigation interventions where water was misused and the difference between the total number of decision events and the actual number of effective irrigation interventions 9 p s i r r i g a t e n s i r r i g a t e n t n s i r r i g a t e this information was then used to estimate the economic impact of taking the wrong action that is a missing irrigation interventions when irrigation is needed or b irrigating when irrigation is not needed missing irrigation causes water stresses with direct consequences on the crops and hence also on revenues misusing water causes unnecessary expense with direct consequences on irrigation costs impacts where estimated differently if the technology predict need to irrigate when irrigation is not needed and if the technology predict no need to irrigate when irrigation is needed the first error results in water misuses and consequently unnecessary costs specifically labour and energy costs the second error results in a reduction in yield and consequently income losses the reduction in yield associated with a missing irrigation intervention is estimated by averaging the ratio of the differences among the highest and the lowest yields obtained in treated plots and the differences amongst the associated effective irrigation interventions the lost income is then calculated by computing the differences between lost revenues crop prices multiplied by the estimated reduction in yield and irrigation costs per irrigation intervention finally the cost associated with water misuses such as unnecessary irrigation interventions is calculated by computing the average amount of water applied per irrigation intervention multiplied by the unit irrigation cost pumping cost per cubic meter of water applied 4 2 results 4 2 1 comparative cost benefit analysis fig 3 reports boxplot results for each experiment the boxplot is built using multiple values generated by computing all of the possible differences in water uses a yield b and economic performances c between ia and pi thus 2 points for each experiment carried out in greece 32 points in denmark 27 points in spain 8 points in italy and 3 points in portugal 2 2 multiple values are generated by multiplying the number of replicates times the number of treatments times the number of years using the information reported in table 1 for example in the greek experiments we had 1 replicate 2 treatments and 2 seasons that made it possible to obtain 2 values differences in values between ia in the first year and pi of the first and differences between ia in the second year and pi in the second year ia performs better than pi when the difference between ia and pi is greater than zero for the yield and the revenue values above the dotted line crossing the y axis to 0 in fig 3 b and c and lower than zero for water uses values below the dotted line crossing the y axis to 0 in fig 3 a the figure does not offer clear evidence that ia performs unambiguously better than pi notably the use of ia seems to perform better than pi for drip irrigation except for drip irrigated potatoes in denmark while performances reverse when comparing ia with pi for sprinkler irrigation the improvement of economic performance using ia showed by the box plots moved up from the dotted line in fig 1c representing the experiments conducted in italy for tomato and maize spain for citrus and greece for drip irrigated cotton is mainly attributable to water savings shown by the box plots below the dotted line in fig 3b the impact on yield is less evident shown by the box plots below the dotted line in fig 3b in general results reveal that the use of the alternative technology generates a 0 20 increase in gross margin and a 10 30 water saving with respect to existing irrigation practices specifically ia proved to perform better for drip irrigated cotton in greece where unlike the other experimental sites an appreciable reduction in water uses was not noticed but rather an increase in yield conversely ia performed worst for drip irrigated potatoes in denmark where on average a reduction in yield was recorded whereas no water savings were noted compared with the local pi 4 2 2 comparative voi analysis table 2 depicts the performance of the irrigation technologies under comparison specifically the table includes information about the number of effective irrigation interventions the applied irrigation interventions that satisfy crop water requirements the number of ineffective irrigation interventions the applied irrigation interventions that are not required and the number of missing irrigation interventions the irrigation interventions that are required but not performed for both pi and ia the data reported in the table represents average values for the whole period of investigation grouped by treatment results from table 2 shows that the information service developed in the project seems to be relatively robust for the experiments carried out in spain italy and greece and less accurate for the others the degree of robustness is expressed by the magnitude of the coefficient of variation cv provided for each variable in table 2 the robustness decreases with increasing variability or increasing cv specifically the experiments conducted in italy and spain showed great variability between the different years of investigation higher coefficients of variation that is the service performance was very different among the different replications and for the different irrigating seasons these results offer a first rough approximation of the service reliability however this information alone is far from offering an evaluation of the service capacity to generate net economic benefits indeed we also need to account for the consequences suffered when taking wrong decisions the estimation of revenues and costs per irrigation intervention is reported in table 3 costs are generally less variable among different seasons than revenues the coefficient of variation is lower indeed costs presumably depend mainly on technological aspects that are controlled by farmers 3 3 energy price is not likely to vary significantly over a small number of consecutive years water use is likely to vary significantly among consecutive years but less variable is the amount of water applied per irrigation intervention as this mainly depends on field capacity while revenues are extremely variable and conditioned by a number of factors that are out of the control of the experiments such as pests and temperatures by comparing the average revenue and cost per irrigation intervention of the different experiments it appears that for some of them revenues are significantly above costs i e drip irrigated tomatoes in italy drip irrigated cotton in greece and sprinkler irrigated maize in portugal and for some others revenues are just slightly above costs such as citrus in spain and potatoes in denmark the difference between revenues and costs is the average productivity of an irrigation intervention and it represents a loss when the irrigation intervention is missed analogously costs represent a loss when the irrigation intervention is unnecessary the ratio between the losses associated with the two types of errors wrongly predicting need to irrigate and wrongly predicting no need to irrigate influences the level of the reference accuracy threshold minimum probability to correctly predict events consistently with eq 3 fig 4 compares the reference accuracy threshold p s m and the probability of correctly predicting events p s m for the messages provided by the information service the results depicted in fig 4 are obtained for each replication of each pair of treatments being compared and for each year for a total number of 82 comparisons ia performs better than pi for the points located below the bisector in fig 4 chart a and b the figure shows that the probability of correctly predicting events is likely to be higher than the reference accuracy threshold for the message with lower failure consequences irrigate most of the points in fig 4 b are below the bisector and lower for the message with higher failure consequences do not irrigate most of the points in fig 4a are above the bisector in any case the quality of information provided by the technologies under comparison must be weighted against the probability of states occurrence the climate condition under which the new technology is tested and the consequences of failing to meet predictions the operational condition under which the new technology is tested to ultimately verify the marketability of the new technology such a comparison leads to the results provided in fig 3 5 discussion the study presents a methodology to assess the economic viability of new methods to schedule irrigation interventions under different conditions the method is applied to the problem of comparing computer irrigation models and existing irrigation practices in estimating and predicting crop water requirements the main novelty of the study concerns the assessment approach based on the voi concept highlighting the role played by information in conditioning the usability of new irrigation technologies to the best of our knowledge compared with previous studies cavazza et al 2018 galioto et al 2017 the empirical example presented here is the first attempt to model the role played by information in triggering changes in irrigation practices at the evaluation stage that is preceding first use of the technology providing original theoretical insight and evidence about regarding the frontiers of application of cim technologies to plan irrigation specifically the empirical example provided by this study compares a new cim technology with the prevailing irrigation practices for different crops and under different operating conditions the results show that taking the overall average there is no substantial difference in performance of the new cim technology compared to existing ones however the new technology performs better for drip irrigated crops and in semi arid regions conversely the new cim technology can perform worse than existing practices in sub humid regions and for sprinkler irrigation performance improvements are mainly attributable to water saving the impact on yield is less evident negative performances were recorded for the danish experiment for drip irrigated potatoes the portuguese experiment for sprinkler irrigated maize and for the greek sprinkler irrigated cotton such unsuccessful applicative examples may result from the fact that for the danish experiment the new cim technology was tested in an operational environment where farmers were already using an advanced cim technology well adapted to local conditions in greece and in portugal the new cim technology was compared with current farm practices in these cases the success of the new cim technology seems to be highly influenced by the type of irrigation system to which the technology is associated sprinkler and drip irrigation the negative performance of the new cim technology with sprinkler irrigation seems to arise mainly from the fact that this system is associated with low frequencies of irrigation interventions here missing an irrigation intervention leads to greater losses than it would happen for drip irrigation namely the reference accuracy threshold is likely to be higher for sprinkler irrigation than for drip irrigation all other conditions being constant this might explain the reason why we recorded good performances for drip irrigation for those experiments located in mediterranean regions here positive performances were recorded when comparing ia both with traditional practices spain and greece and with existing cim technologies italy besides the difficulties in finding suitable comparable technologies as highlighted above the present study faced various limitations and challenges especially regarding the application of the method the evidence reported on a case study basis lacks a sufficient number of observations in time and space hence making it impossible to generalise the results provided here three years of investigation and analysis were insufficient to achieve robust results accordingly a longer testing period with more replications should be sought in the future in addition from a methodological point of view the probability of correctly estimating water requirements should be calculated by directly measuring soil moisture content before and after each irrigation intervention and not approximated by comparing differences in yield as we did in this study differences in yield can be used as valuable costless proxies for water stresses if no other factors than water interfere in conditioning them this is not usually the case in real world conditions in addition the methodology provided here is designed for discrete choices such the application or non application of water and losses are assumed to vary linearly with forecasting errors losses associated with two forecasting errors account for twice the losses of one forecasting error thus a further refinement of the approach presented here could link the probabilities of forecasting errors to water stress levels rather than irrigation interventions 6 conclusions the present paper analysed the role played by information technologies in the scheduling of irrigation in agriculture the paper depicts a simplified analysis with an eye to displaying the process by which information can contribute to building realistic expectations about future events hence influencing strategic decisions the results obtained reveal that a given cim technology does not perform in the same way in different regions mediterranean and continental regions for different crops maize processing tomatoes cotton citrus or different irrigation systems sprinkler and drip irrigation this highlights that such type of tool must be fine tuned to local conditions before considering their broader dissemination the assessment procedure developed in this study could help public authorities to identify the right set of instruments to drive the uptake of cim technologies at the local level for example the subsidisation of research aimed at improving the quality and usability of new cim technologies and or subsidizing investments in public infrastructures to guarantee accessibility to the relevant information i e meteorological station networks water table level monitoring stations etc could be suggested in those cases where it is found that the technology is not yet ready to be disseminated among end users subsidies for dissemination and advisory services might be worth implementing to trigger the adoption in those cases where it is found that the technology has already good performance but needs to be better known and appreciated by potential end users in cases of low adoption it can also help to understand if the problem is the technology itself or external conditions e g water or agricultural product prices and the extent to which a policy is needed at all in any case the results obtained with this study suggest that cim technologies can actually contribute to increase substantially the efficiency of irrigation practices in sub humid and sub arid regions where the presence of climate variability justifies the use of advanced technologies to drive irrigation interventions in the near future for drip irrigated crops where the consequences of failing to meet irrigation requirements are low compared to sprinkler irrigated crops in addition other studies montesano et al 2015 cambouris et al 2014 fallahi et al 2015 demonstrated that the use of such technologies is particularly welcome for crops where the amount of water applied influences the quality of the production which can be linked to the role of prices in our model a further improvement of this study would be that of extending the method from the evaluation stage of the information technology to the early adoption stage and to analyse the linkages between farm risk attitudes and the quality of information and the relevant impact on water and land uses as well as issues related to knowledge sharing and familiarity cabantous

10821,this study develops a methodology to assess the comparative advantages of new methods to plan irrigation with respect to prevailing existing irrigation practices the methodology consists of a comparative cost benefit analysis based on the value of information approach that makes it possible to analyse whether an improvement in the information available to farmers generates economic benefits the method is applied to the problem of comparing computer irrigation models providing irrigation advice based on measurements water balance models and weather predictions and prevailing irrigation practices at times based on soil and plant observations or on advanced technologies in estimating and predicting crop water requirements in pilot experiments located in four different european regions the results reveal that the introduction of the alternative method improves the performance of irrigation practices in mediterranean regions that are characterised by high weather variability and for those crops for which the consequences of failing to meet predictions are relatively low i e tomato instead of maize drip irrigated crops instead of sprinkler irrigated crops under favourable conditions the use of the alternative technology generates a 0 20 increase in gross margin and a 10 30 water saving with respect to prevailing existing irrigation practices the study concludes by addressing the conditions that justify the use of advanced information systems to schedule irrigation interventions and by offering some policy recommendations to drive their uptake these include subsidising research at the evaluation stage and public investments aimed at knowledge creation weather and shallow water table monitoring stations and knowledge sharing counselling at the adoption stage keywords irrigation scheduling uncertainty value of information 1 introduction during the last decade the agricultural sector in europe has seen the introduction of information and communication technologies ict that have the potential to increase farmers access to public and private information improving among other aspects their efficiency in using water resources aker et al 2016 the recent diffusion of ict for agriculture in europe is favoured by the common agricultural policy cap which dedicates financial support to improve irrigation scheduling and to promote the dissemination of water saving irrigation techniques especially for water sensitive areas the adoption of computer irrigation models cims is sometimes a prerequisite for farmers to receive subsidies galioto et al 2017 cims provide messages to farmers about whether to irrigate and how much often through smartphones bartlett et al 2015 by coupling information from water balance models field sensors and weather forecasts increased interest from the scientific community in developing new cim technologies amongst the others corbari et al 2019 li et al 2018 nguyen et al 2017 has been documented worldwide but a clear understanding of the actual usage of cim technologies to plan irrigation interventions and the relevant impacts is still missing hence weakening arguments in favour of the public value of supporting their adoption galioto et al 2017 nakasone and torero 2016 this is because of the intangible nature of the product generated by these technologies namely information and because of the impossibility of checking whether farmers formally adopting cims are actually using them consequently the ambiguous performance of commercial cim technologies does not help public authorities in the design of adequate policy interventions to convey their proliferation therefore public authorities will at times provide incentives for the adoption when these technologies are not yet mature enough to be marketed with the result of failing both to increase farmers competitiveness and to trigger water saving practices bartlett et al 2015 from an economic point of view the decision by farmers to use cims to plan irrigation may be interpreted as dependent upon economic performance i e the comparison of the benefits identified as the value of information voi against costs most farmers will decide to adopt new management practices and begin to purchase and learn to use the technology only when they are convinced that the time and money spent are justified by improved yields or reduced costs or risk thus a farmer s decision to use a new information technology especially to plan irrigation starts from assessing the voi associated with it this value is influenced by the existing information status under which the farmer operates the type and quality of the additional information made available to the farmer and the consequences brought about by the use of the new information technology the objective of this paper is to develop and test a methodology to assess the comparative advantages of cims to plan irrigation with respect to prevailing existing irrigation practices this is a challenging issue due to the uncertainty surrounding the information produced by cims and due to incomplete knowledge of its effects the method is based on applying the voi approach bikhchandani et al 2013 to assess the extent to which an improvement in the quality of the available information justifies the change in the criteria used by the farmer to schedule irrigation the developed approach shows that better information does not necessarily imply changes in the criteria used to schedule irrigation the transition to new information sources is in fact conditioned by the expected benefits of using such information such benefits are influenced by elements that are both intrinsic to the technology itself such as the quality of the information provided and extrinsic namely the operational conditions under which the technology is implemented an empirical implementation of the method is also provided with the aim of investigating the factors that motivate investments in such type of technologies since the pioneering article of raiffa 1974 a number of scholars have introduced methodologies and empirical analyses similar to the one developed in this study in different fields of research bouma et al 2009 cavazza et al 2018 galioto et al 2017 lindner and gibbs 1990 liu et al 2008 yet there is limited literature available that applies the voi approach on issues related to water management cavazza et al 2018 galioto et al 2017 liu et al 2008 the existing literature highlights the potentialities of cims applied to the management of water resources both at the district level cavazza et al 2018 and at the irrigation plot level galioto et al 2017 liu et al 2008 in all cases the voi approach is used to evaluate the economic performance of new cims compared to the existing ones without really exploring how new information contributes to triggering changes in water management practices and most importantly without applying this approach to real case studies the methodology presented in this paper differs from previous studies both in the method and in the empirical implementation from a methodological perspective this study applies a voi approach to analyse the role played by information in influencing decision making disentangling the process of value creation brought about by the introduction of new pieces of information and providing a theoretical explanation of the conditions that might favour the use of new information technologies in the field of irrigation scheduling in addition the method is tested using data from field experiments in the framework of irrigation scheduling a practice particularly sensitive to the availability of information but not yet studied in the perspective offered by the present study thus the present study might contribute to fill existing gaps in the dedicated literature that to the best knowledge of the authors do not provide a clear understanding of the real benefits brought about by the introduction of cims in agriculture the remainder of the paper is organised as follows the literature review section 2 discusses how uncertainty is approached in the agricultural economic literature motivating the criterion used to assess the viability of new sources of information the methodology section 3 describes the assessment approach that was adopted while an empirical example is provided in section 4 where we compare different sources of information to schedule irrigation interventions at an experimental level section 5 discusses the main implications of the results obtained section 6 concludes whilst providing some policy recommendations and hints for further research on the topic 2 literature review lack of access to information is considered to be a major problem in the agricultural sector as it contributes to maintaining unsustainable agricultural practices and pressure on resources especially water resources nakasone and torero 2016 in fact a considerable number of studies in recent decades have analysed the management of water resources under uncertain information environments perry and narayanamurthy 1998 both at the district level anon 2014 chung et al 2009 das et al 2015 qin et al 2007 sabouni and mardani 2013 wang and huang 2012 and at the farm level carey and zilberman 2002 these studies support the idea that the natural variability of production not depending on the management of water resources hampers the adoption of advanced water supply and irrigation technologies because of the uncertain outcomes nevertheless in the real world the high risk of extreme outcomes triggers the adoption of advanced water supply and irrigation technologies the discrepancy between what is argued by the cited scholars and what is happening in the real world can find a possible explanation in the fact that such scholars did not explicitly include in their assessment methodology the adoption of information technologies such technologies contribute to influencing the perception of uncertain events by decision makers and consequently the decision maker s capacity to manage uncertain events in fact information helps farmers to develop strategies for mitigating the possibility of adverse events harwood et al 1999 when making decisions under uncertainty and risk there is the possibility of receiving different degrees of information prior to making the decision more information reduces the uncertainty and facilitates improved decision making the voi is used as a generic term for the increase in value resulting from better informed actions raiffa 1974 generally the greater the uncertainty of the outcome the higher the value of information additionally the more it will cost to use the information to make decisions the lower the price of the next best substitute for the information the lower the value of information laxminarayan and macauley 2012 to the best of our knowledge the voi approach has seldom been applied to the agricultural sector 1 1 the concept of the value of information has been applied in various fields such as economics finance medicine and engineering chiang and feng 2007 koerkamp et al 2006 furthermore the value of information has been estimated by different studies dealing with environmental resource management and disaster prevention bouma et al 2009 trigg and roy 2007 only few studies dealt with agriculture liu et al 2008 galioto et al 2017 cavazza et al 2018 a first attempt at applying the voi approach in agriculture was made by adams et al 1995 specifically they applied this approach to estimate the economic effects on agriculture of an improvement in the capacity to predict extreme weather events prior to the growing season in the southeastern us they found that increases in the accuracy of weather predictions have substantial economic value to agriculture making it possible to take precautionary measures with regard to land use hence mitigating damages more recently liu et al 2008 developed a methodology to assess the voi in precision farming specifically they developed a methodology to assess economic improvements in applying nutrients through variable rate application and a methodology to assess economic improvements in rationalizing land uses by applying technologies to discriminate management zones with different production potential later galioto et al 2017 applied the voi approach to assess the value generated by new irrigation technologies that improve information about soil characteristics and weather conditions based on simulation modelling cavazza et al 2018 developed a methodology based on the voi approach to evaluate how the combination of different information technologies contribute to influencing sequential decisions for the management of water resources at the district level based on simulation modelling however such studies do not provide any empirical evidence and the role played by information in improving farm performance in the field of precision farming is still unclear in fact there is no clear evidence that precision farming increases profit or decreases environmental impacts long et al 2016 the value of the information approach is particularly relevant when analysing decisions regarding water management cavazza et al 2018 and especially irrigation scheduling galioto et al 2017 the use of cims to schedule irrigation can increase irrigation efficiency this is because cims are supposed to offer better information about crops and their environment with the potential to help farmers in taking decisions closer to the optimal as the use of water and energy is concerned cims provide farmers with information about when and how much to irrigate coupling real time micro weather stations plant based sensors e g reflectance infrared temperatures or video and numerous real time soil water sensors scattered around the field at key locations to feed a set of predictive models cims potentially ensure higher economic returns principally by triggering a more rational use of inputs delgado and bausch 2005 hedley et al 2009 meisinger and delgado 2002 sadler et al 2005 tas et al 2016 and sometimes increasing yield and production quality cambouris et al 2014 fallahi et al 2010 2011 2015 montesano et al 2015 with respect to input uses scholars agree that the use of cims make it possible to save labour energy for pumping water water and fertilizer consumption moreover the possibility to differentiate the field in management zones can reduce the risk of having areas in the same field that are either too wet or too dry hence rationalizing the use of pumping energy and the consumption of water for irrigation li et al 2018 cims are also considered to be a primary management tool to reduce n leaching delgado and bausch 2005 meisinger and delgado 2002 nguyen et al 2017 and to minimize the need for continuous and expensive monitoring reducing labour efforts bartlett et al 2015 sadler et al 2005 with respect to crop production recent studies demonstrate that with irrigation scheduling services it is also possible to increase product quality recent results in this direction have been reported for tomatoes montesano et al 2015 potatoes cambouris et al 2014 and especially for fruit fallahi et al 2015 several studies have found that the magnitude of the benefit brought about by the use of water saving practices is conditioned by a number of factors especially the type of crop evett and schwartz 2011 the type of irrigation systems caswell and zilberman 1985 genius et al 2013 field characteristics sadler et al 2005 sunding and zilberman 1999 climate conditions sauer et al 2010 and the quality of information sadler et al 2005 usaid 2012 however farmers are often hesitant to use new practices to schedule irrigation and especially to drive irrigation by way of cims long et al 2016 this is because of different uncertainties regarding the economic value of better irrigation information in particular if the availability of irrigation water is also uncertain botes et al 1995 nguyen et al 2017 and due to the perception of more complicated management procedures and learning needs considered to increase transaction costs for the farm galioto et al 2017 these conditions substantiate the need to identify an appropriate methodology to evaluate whether an improvement in the quality of information to schedule irrigation introduced by the availability of new technologies justifies the use of such technologies 3 methodology 3 1 set up the approach presented here values the economic benefits of possible improvements in the quality of information to plan irrigation at what can be called the evaluation stage i e when the famer decides the type of information support to adopt for the scheduling of irrigation the method seeks inspiration and uses data from empirical experiments conducted in the framework of the european fp7 project figaro aimed at the development of new information tools to schedule irrigation further detail is provided in the next section in the figaro project the consortium developed a new cim technology to support irrigation scheduling to verify the marketability of the new technology the consortium ran a set of experiments to compare it with the prevailing irrigation practices in different regions in this respect in each experimental site the consortium identified a number of fields with similar characteristics similar soil texture morphology and size all of which were growing the same crops i e processing tomatoes maize etc and using the same irrigation technologies i e sprinkler drip etc for each experimental site irrigation was scheduled through the irrigation advice ia provided by the new cim technology on half of the fields and with the prevailing irrigation practice pi on the other half during the irrigation season the consortium monitored soil moisture before and after each irrigation intervention the amount of water applied for each irrigation intervention and the yield obtained in all experimental fields additional information on crop prices and unit irrigation costs from each experimental site was collected in this paper we use this information to develop two comparative approaches to assess the performance of the new technology the first one is a conventional cost benefit analysis to assess the relative performance of the new technology this is implemented using available information from the test fields the second step introduces an alternative assessment approach aimed at estimating accuracy thresholds about the new cim and providing a better understanding of the suitability of this tool depending on contextual production and climate conditions this makes it possible to underscore the role of information in the process of value creation it builds on the same information used above but also requires additional assumptions as the original information was not specifically collected for this purpose 3 2 comparative cost benefit analysis the collected information made it possible to compare differences in a small set of selected performance indicators i namely yield water uses and gross margins the difference between revenues and irrigation costs among the alternative irrigation scheduling systems to guarantee comparability across treatments we computed the following relative indicators for each performance parameter 1 r i i a i i i a i i p i 1 where r i i a is the relative performance of ia compared to pi for the i th performance indicator i i i a and i i p i are the i th performance indicators for the comparing irrigations scheduling systems when r i i a 0 there are no comparative advantages with the new technology ia perform better than pi if r i i a 0 for yield and the gross margin and if r i i a 0 for water uses the relative performance of the gross margin is influenced by the relative level of the other two indicators a higher yield affects gross margin positively through multiplication by the price higher water use affects it negatively through multiplication by the cost per cubic meter of irrigation water the compensation among indicators can in principle result in better performance for either pi or ia namely the positive economic performance of ia compared to pi is associated to increases in water use efficiency i e higher average productivity of water this does not necessarily imply water saving 3 3 comparative voi approach in this second step we refine and generalise the assessment approach presented above by developing a method to identify message accuracy thresholds that incorporate and operationalise the value of the information advice provided by the cim and compare it across decision support tools this value depends on the quality of information provided by the cim on the existing information environment under which the farmer operates and on the magnitude of the impacts associated with the decisions at stake the term quality of information in the present empirical framework is used as a synonym for the accuracy of the messages provided by the irrigation methods under comparison probability to correctly predict states in order to proceed we first have to better formalize the description of the decision problem by introducing the concept of messages states and actions messages represent the irrigation advice offered by a generic information service providing estimates about the probability of occurrence of states in the near future next decision making period states represent the different environmental conditions under which the crop is grown and that influence crop water requirements actions are the possible choices the farmer can make to satisfy crop water requirements without loss of generality and for the sake of simplicity we consider a binary representation of the problem with two messages irrigate and do not irrigate two states rain no rain and two actions irrigating and not irrigating messages actions and states occur into a sequential process where first the farmer receives a message from the information service second the farmer decides among a set of alternative actions third the farmer faces a set of alternative states depending on which the consequences of his actions pay off are determined thus following a backward induction process the farmer takes decisions and faces expected consequences on the basis of his expectation with respect to the existing information status of a comparable technology consistently with the voi approach we refer to the farmer s expectation as the farmer s expectation regarding the occurrence of forthcoming states that are conditional to the message received the sequential process described above is depicted by the decision tree in fig 1 for the message do not irrigate to formalize our problem we use the term m for a generic message supplied by the information service s for the occurrence of the state predicted by the message and s for the occurrence of the state not predicted by the message a for the action follow the message and a for the action do not follow the message in this framework a is coherent with m and a is not coherent with m likewise s is coherent with m and s is not coherent with m in addition we use the term p s m for the probability of occurrence of the state predicted by the message and p s m for the probability of occurrence of the state not predicted by the message and such that p s m p s m 1 if the information provided by the message is perfect p s m 1 and consequently p s m 0 for each message provided by the information service on the other hand if the information provided by the message is not perfect p s m 1 consequently p s m 0 finally we use the term l a s for the losses faced by the farmer when taking the right action and l a s for the losses faced by the farmer when taking the wrong action actions cause a loss when these are not consistent with states l a s 0 otherwise the loss is null l a s 0 the expected loss associated with each action taken by the farmer a a is then conditioned by her expectation about the likelihood of the upcoming states the value of the expected loss associated with each action is then obtained by the following equation 2a r a m l a s p s m l a s p s m m m 2b r a m l a s p s m l a s p s m m m where r a m is the expected loss associated with the action follow the message and r a m is the expected loss associated to the action do not follow the message the first term on the right hand side of eq 2a is null for the action follow the message and the second term on the right hand side of the eq 2b is null for the action do not follow the message because actions are coherent with states it is worthwhile to follow the message only if the expected losses associated with the action follow the message r a m are lower compared to the expected losses associated with the action do not follow the message r a m such that 3 r a m r a m o r p s m p s m l a s l a s o r p m l m 1 m m where pm is the relative error probability wrong predictions divided by right predictions about the occurrence of state s provided by the message m lm is the relative loss losses associated with the action do not follow the message l a s divided by losses associated with the action follow the message l a s when the ratio between the relative error probability and the relative loss p m l m is below 1 the expected loss associated with the action follow the message is lower than the expected loss associated with the action do not follow the message and messages can be considered accurate enough to drive decisions from the former eq 3 it is possible to calculate a reference accuracy threshold p s m the minimum probability to correctly predict events needed to justify the action follow the message 4 p s m p s m 1 p s m p s m l m a n d p s m 1 1 l m m m p s m is an inverse function of lm the value of p s m is high when lm is small and low when lm is high when the probability to correctly predict states is greater than the reference accuracy threshold p s m p s m it is worthwhile to follow the message fig 2 lm is zero if there are no consequences when disregarding the message that implicitly means that there are no rational reasons to take the action follow the message even though the message delivered by the new technology is extremely accurate in these extreme circumstances the reference accuracy threshold equals 1 based on common sense experience of economic parameters linked to irrigation yield and water uses it can be expected that the magnitude of the lm parameters are highly dependent on the type of message delivered by the new technology when the message is do not irrigate and the action is follow the message then the losses suffered when failing to meet the prediction are that the farmer is missing an irrigation intervention when irrigation is actually required with direct consequences on crop yield on the contrary when the message is irrigate and the action is follow the message then the losses suffered when failing to meet the prediction are that the farmer is misusing water when irrigation is actually not required with direct consequences on water uses and irrigation costs but not very much on yields except for very high amounts of water thus the relative loss is likely higher for the message do not irrigate and lower for the message irrigate that implies that higher accuracy is required to drive decisions for the messages to which higher losses are associated this is the message do not irrigate in our problem hence in light of the lm calculated from eq 5 for each message it can be expected that l d o n t i r r i g a t e l i r r i g a t e as a result p s d o n t i r r i g a t e p s i r r i g a t e in general the message service is more valuable if those messages to which higher losses are associated are accurate enough to drive decisions namely when p s d o n t i r r i g a t e p s d o n t i r r i g a t e the analysis made so far provides a rationale to assess if messages are accurate enough to be used to schedule irrigation the approach presented here reveals that the usability of the information technology under evaluation is influenced by factors that are both intrinsic the accuracy of the irrigation advice and extrinsic to the technology itself the magnitude of losses is influenced by factors such as crop type climate conditions and irrigation technologies while this is true for a single decision about irrigating comparing information technologies entails calculating the performances of the messages delivered across the whole season in our case the problem is to compare the performances obtained by scheduling irrigation through the information advice ia provided by a new cim technology with the performances obtained with existing prevailing irrigation practices pi in a given region ia performs better than pi if the following condition is satisfied 5 m 1 m p s r a m i a m 1 m p s r a m p i where the superscript ia and pi represent the comparing information sources the subscript m1 and m2 are the messages offered by the comparing information sources respectively irrigate and do not irrigate the subscript a1 and a2 are the actions that are coherent with the messages delivered by the comparing information sources the subscript s1 and s2 are the states need to irrigate and no need to irrigate this last step makes it possible to verify if the new cim technology is competitive with respect to the prevailing existing irrigation practices that is if it is capable of improving the quality of the information environment under which farmers operate in the following we introduce a case study in which we applied the methodologies developed thus far 4 an empirical application 4 1 data sources the methodology described in section 3 above was tested using the data collected in the context of the fp7 figaro project we compared two treatments a first treatment that followed a prevailing existing irrigation practice pi and a second treatment where irrigation was scheduled by means of the irrigation advice ia of the cim developed in the project the first is considered to be the benchmark strategy whereby irrigation is performed by checking the status of soil and vegetation conditions and using meteorological predictions provided by local meteorological stations and sometimes with recourse to additional soil water or weather information the latter incorporates advanced instruments such as local weather stations soil moisture sensors and agronomic models to estimate and predict crop water requirements in the near future during the irrigation season the comparison was performed for five different pedo climatic regions denmark south portugal south spain northern greece and northern italy and five major water demanding crops maize processing tomato cotton potatoes and citrus from 2013 to 2015 table 1 specifically 2 treatments one for pi and one for ia were carried out in each region over 2 consecutive years with the exception of the spanish and the portuguese region where the experiments where prolonged for an additional year each treatment was replicated once for the greek and portuguese regions twice for the italian region 3 times for the spanish region and 4 times for the danish region differences between ia and pi were estimated by comparing each replication of the alternative treatments for each experiment and year for example the presence of 1 replication per treatment makes it possible to perform only 1 comparison between the two treatments for each year of experiment this is the case of the greek and portuguese experiment the presence of 2 replications per treatment allows for 4 comparisons this is the case of the italian experiment the presence of 3 replications per treatment makes it possible to perform 9 comparisons this is the case of the spanish experiment and the presence of 4 replications per treatment allows for 16 comparisons this is the case of the danish experiment as a result we have 82 comparisons considering the whole period of field experiments of which 36 comparisons in 2013 and 2014 and 10 comparisons in 2015 experimental sites were selected following three key criteria 1 the existence of significant temporal variability in factors influencing irrigation interventions by cultivating summer crops 2 the presence of adequate equipment to monitor the status of water content in the soil soil moisture and plant sensors and 3 the direct control of crop management practices by the project staff in some cases field experiments were conducted on commercial farms such criteria did not guarantee perfect homogeneity in the selection of experiments indeed field experiments where selected by the project consortium members who in some cases relied on their own field experiments denmark and italy by using commercial sites and in other contracting the cultivation of specific crops with farmers portugal spain greece the crops selected for the comparison between ia and pi were chosen on the basis of their representativeness in the surrounding region of each experimental site the pi identified in each area was associated to 1 the most performing cim available in the region for experimental sites directly managed by the project staff 2 the practices used by the farmers directly cooperating in the experiments for the other sites specifically the danish experiment was carried out on experimental fields and the new cim technology was compared with an existing cim technology that is used to schedule irrigation for potatoes in the region daisy decision support system https daisy ku dk in italy the new cim technology was compared with irriframe the most popular decision support system used by farmers in the region to schedule irrigation https www irriframe it irriframe home index er for the other experimental sites the new cim technology developed in the project was compared with existing farm practices mainly based on farm experiences and local weather forecast thus the cim technology developed in the project was compared with different technologies under very different agro ecological conditions hence making it possible to assess the intrinsic value of the technology under heterogeneous real world conditions which allow for analyses of the circumstances under which the new technology is potentially capable of increasing the performance of the existing irrigation practices the experimental sites managed by contracting farmers where strictly monitored by the project staff for each experiment information was collected on soil moisture before and after irrigation using tensiometers scattered in each experimental field to estimate variations in the humidity level of the soil using the technologies under analysis water use by installing water meters at the pump outlet on each experimental site including commercial sites and monitoring the entire season in such a way as to obtain the precise number of irrigation interventions and the amount of water used per irrigation intervention for each season of treatment yield estimated by monitoring canopy growth which is useful to understand at which phenological stage water stress is suffered by the crop and then by sampling cropping areas at harvesting in addition information was collected on management practices specifically frequencies duration and amount of water applied for each irrigation intervention and on prices using a protocol developed by the authors specifically economic information on energy prices crop prices and labour costs collected using official statistical information when available from local statistical sources otherwise from the eurostat database http ec europa eu eurostat and the fao database http faostat fao org technological characteristics of the irrigation system including the hydraulic head of the pumping system the flow rate of the water delivered to the field the pumping efficiency and the power of the pump to estimate energy consumption per cubic meter of water applied man hours to equip each irrigation intervention number of irrigation intervention timeframe of each irrigation intervention scheduled through the protocol during the whole irrigating season the inconsistency of soil moisture measurements during the entire irrigation season in most of the experimental fields breakages errors of measurement etc made it such that it was not possible to assess water in excess and water at fault for the technologies being compared for this reason to implement the voi approach we relied on the information used to perform the cost benefit analysis on the number of irrigation interventions for each treatment and year and on the following assumptions needed to indirectly estimate the probability to wrongly predict events the target number of effective irrigation events n is set equal to the number of irrigation events of the best performing experimental plot for each experiment and each year of investigation the actual number of effective irrigation interventions for each experimental plot n s i r r i g a t e is set equal to the target number of effective irrigation interventions multiplied by the ratio between the yield obtained in the experimental plot and the maximum yield for each experiment and each year of investigation the total number of decision events n t is set equal to the ratio between the length of the irrigation season and the minimum period between two consecutive decision events for the whole period of investigation the information collected and the assumptions made allowed for a rough estimate of the quality of information from the technologies being compared which were used to drive irrigation interventions and of the associated impacts to implement the methodology developed here which is based on discrete choices whether or not to irrigate rather than how much to irrigate the number of missing irrigation interventions the absence of watering when irrigation is actually required for each treatment was computed by calculating the differences between the target number of effective irrigation interventions and the actual number of effective irrigation interventions between the technologies being compared this is formalized in the following equation 6 n s d o n t i r r i g a t e n n s i r r i g a t e eqs 6 to 9 are defined for each observation replication of each treatment being compared the subscript in brackets defines the message delivered to the farmer that in our study overlaps with the actions taken by the farmer in our experiment both messages rendered by ia and pi drive actions the number of missing irrigation interventions equals the difference between the target number of irrigation events and the actual number of effective irrigation interventions the number of irrigation interventions where the state no rain is coherent with the action irrigate furthermore the number of irrigation interventions where water is misused was calculated by computing the difference between the actual number of irrigation interventions and the actual number of effective irrigations carried out by the treatments being compared this is formalized by the following equation 7 n s i r r i g a t e n i r r i g a t e n s i r r i g a t e in eq 6 n s i r r i g a t e is for the number of irrigation interventions where water is misused the state rain is not coherent with the action irrigate this number equals the difference between total number of irrigation interventions made by the farmer and the number of irrigation interventions that are coherent with the state no rain finally the probability of wrongly predicting no need to irrigate was computed by the ratio of the number of missing irrigation interventions and the target number of effective irrigation interventions 8 p s d o n t i r r i g a t e n s d o n t i r r i g a t e n similarly the probability of wrongly predicting need to irrigate was obtained by the ratio of the number of irrigation interventions where water was misused and the difference between the total number of decision events and the actual number of effective irrigation interventions 9 p s i r r i g a t e n s i r r i g a t e n t n s i r r i g a t e this information was then used to estimate the economic impact of taking the wrong action that is a missing irrigation interventions when irrigation is needed or b irrigating when irrigation is not needed missing irrigation causes water stresses with direct consequences on the crops and hence also on revenues misusing water causes unnecessary expense with direct consequences on irrigation costs impacts where estimated differently if the technology predict need to irrigate when irrigation is not needed and if the technology predict no need to irrigate when irrigation is needed the first error results in water misuses and consequently unnecessary costs specifically labour and energy costs the second error results in a reduction in yield and consequently income losses the reduction in yield associated with a missing irrigation intervention is estimated by averaging the ratio of the differences among the highest and the lowest yields obtained in treated plots and the differences amongst the associated effective irrigation interventions the lost income is then calculated by computing the differences between lost revenues crop prices multiplied by the estimated reduction in yield and irrigation costs per irrigation intervention finally the cost associated with water misuses such as unnecessary irrigation interventions is calculated by computing the average amount of water applied per irrigation intervention multiplied by the unit irrigation cost pumping cost per cubic meter of water applied 4 2 results 4 2 1 comparative cost benefit analysis fig 3 reports boxplot results for each experiment the boxplot is built using multiple values generated by computing all of the possible differences in water uses a yield b and economic performances c between ia and pi thus 2 points for each experiment carried out in greece 32 points in denmark 27 points in spain 8 points in italy and 3 points in portugal 2 2 multiple values are generated by multiplying the number of replicates times the number of treatments times the number of years using the information reported in table 1 for example in the greek experiments we had 1 replicate 2 treatments and 2 seasons that made it possible to obtain 2 values differences in values between ia in the first year and pi of the first and differences between ia in the second year and pi in the second year ia performs better than pi when the difference between ia and pi is greater than zero for the yield and the revenue values above the dotted line crossing the y axis to 0 in fig 3 b and c and lower than zero for water uses values below the dotted line crossing the y axis to 0 in fig 3 a the figure does not offer clear evidence that ia performs unambiguously better than pi notably the use of ia seems to perform better than pi for drip irrigation except for drip irrigated potatoes in denmark while performances reverse when comparing ia with pi for sprinkler irrigation the improvement of economic performance using ia showed by the box plots moved up from the dotted line in fig 1c representing the experiments conducted in italy for tomato and maize spain for citrus and greece for drip irrigated cotton is mainly attributable to water savings shown by the box plots below the dotted line in fig 3b the impact on yield is less evident shown by the box plots below the dotted line in fig 3b in general results reveal that the use of the alternative technology generates a 0 20 increase in gross margin and a 10 30 water saving with respect to existing irrigation practices specifically ia proved to perform better for drip irrigated cotton in greece where unlike the other experimental sites an appreciable reduction in water uses was not noticed but rather an increase in yield conversely ia performed worst for drip irrigated potatoes in denmark where on average a reduction in yield was recorded whereas no water savings were noted compared with the local pi 4 2 2 comparative voi analysis table 2 depicts the performance of the irrigation technologies under comparison specifically the table includes information about the number of effective irrigation interventions the applied irrigation interventions that satisfy crop water requirements the number of ineffective irrigation interventions the applied irrigation interventions that are not required and the number of missing irrigation interventions the irrigation interventions that are required but not performed for both pi and ia the data reported in the table represents average values for the whole period of investigation grouped by treatment results from table 2 shows that the information service developed in the project seems to be relatively robust for the experiments carried out in spain italy and greece and less accurate for the others the degree of robustness is expressed by the magnitude of the coefficient of variation cv provided for each variable in table 2 the robustness decreases with increasing variability or increasing cv specifically the experiments conducted in italy and spain showed great variability between the different years of investigation higher coefficients of variation that is the service performance was very different among the different replications and for the different irrigating seasons these results offer a first rough approximation of the service reliability however this information alone is far from offering an evaluation of the service capacity to generate net economic benefits indeed we also need to account for the consequences suffered when taking wrong decisions the estimation of revenues and costs per irrigation intervention is reported in table 3 costs are generally less variable among different seasons than revenues the coefficient of variation is lower indeed costs presumably depend mainly on technological aspects that are controlled by farmers 3 3 energy price is not likely to vary significantly over a small number of consecutive years water use is likely to vary significantly among consecutive years but less variable is the amount of water applied per irrigation intervention as this mainly depends on field capacity while revenues are extremely variable and conditioned by a number of factors that are out of the control of the experiments such as pests and temperatures by comparing the average revenue and cost per irrigation intervention of the different experiments it appears that for some of them revenues are significantly above costs i e drip irrigated tomatoes in italy drip irrigated cotton in greece and sprinkler irrigated maize in portugal and for some others revenues are just slightly above costs such as citrus in spain and potatoes in denmark the difference between revenues and costs is the average productivity of an irrigation intervention and it represents a loss when the irrigation intervention is missed analogously costs represent a loss when the irrigation intervention is unnecessary the ratio between the losses associated with the two types of errors wrongly predicting need to irrigate and wrongly predicting no need to irrigate influences the level of the reference accuracy threshold minimum probability to correctly predict events consistently with eq 3 fig 4 compares the reference accuracy threshold p s m and the probability of correctly predicting events p s m for the messages provided by the information service the results depicted in fig 4 are obtained for each replication of each pair of treatments being compared and for each year for a total number of 82 comparisons ia performs better than pi for the points located below the bisector in fig 4 chart a and b the figure shows that the probability of correctly predicting events is likely to be higher than the reference accuracy threshold for the message with lower failure consequences irrigate most of the points in fig 4 b are below the bisector and lower for the message with higher failure consequences do not irrigate most of the points in fig 4a are above the bisector in any case the quality of information provided by the technologies under comparison must be weighted against the probability of states occurrence the climate condition under which the new technology is tested and the consequences of failing to meet predictions the operational condition under which the new technology is tested to ultimately verify the marketability of the new technology such a comparison leads to the results provided in fig 3 5 discussion the study presents a methodology to assess the economic viability of new methods to schedule irrigation interventions under different conditions the method is applied to the problem of comparing computer irrigation models and existing irrigation practices in estimating and predicting crop water requirements the main novelty of the study concerns the assessment approach based on the voi concept highlighting the role played by information in conditioning the usability of new irrigation technologies to the best of our knowledge compared with previous studies cavazza et al 2018 galioto et al 2017 the empirical example presented here is the first attempt to model the role played by information in triggering changes in irrigation practices at the evaluation stage that is preceding first use of the technology providing original theoretical insight and evidence about regarding the frontiers of application of cim technologies to plan irrigation specifically the empirical example provided by this study compares a new cim technology with the prevailing irrigation practices for different crops and under different operating conditions the results show that taking the overall average there is no substantial difference in performance of the new cim technology compared to existing ones however the new technology performs better for drip irrigated crops and in semi arid regions conversely the new cim technology can perform worse than existing practices in sub humid regions and for sprinkler irrigation performance improvements are mainly attributable to water saving the impact on yield is less evident negative performances were recorded for the danish experiment for drip irrigated potatoes the portuguese experiment for sprinkler irrigated maize and for the greek sprinkler irrigated cotton such unsuccessful applicative examples may result from the fact that for the danish experiment the new cim technology was tested in an operational environment where farmers were already using an advanced cim technology well adapted to local conditions in greece and in portugal the new cim technology was compared with current farm practices in these cases the success of the new cim technology seems to be highly influenced by the type of irrigation system to which the technology is associated sprinkler and drip irrigation the negative performance of the new cim technology with sprinkler irrigation seems to arise mainly from the fact that this system is associated with low frequencies of irrigation interventions here missing an irrigation intervention leads to greater losses than it would happen for drip irrigation namely the reference accuracy threshold is likely to be higher for sprinkler irrigation than for drip irrigation all other conditions being constant this might explain the reason why we recorded good performances for drip irrigation for those experiments located in mediterranean regions here positive performances were recorded when comparing ia both with traditional practices spain and greece and with existing cim technologies italy besides the difficulties in finding suitable comparable technologies as highlighted above the present study faced various limitations and challenges especially regarding the application of the method the evidence reported on a case study basis lacks a sufficient number of observations in time and space hence making it impossible to generalise the results provided here three years of investigation and analysis were insufficient to achieve robust results accordingly a longer testing period with more replications should be sought in the future in addition from a methodological point of view the probability of correctly estimating water requirements should be calculated by directly measuring soil moisture content before and after each irrigation intervention and not approximated by comparing differences in yield as we did in this study differences in yield can be used as valuable costless proxies for water stresses if no other factors than water interfere in conditioning them this is not usually the case in real world conditions in addition the methodology provided here is designed for discrete choices such the application or non application of water and losses are assumed to vary linearly with forecasting errors losses associated with two forecasting errors account for twice the losses of one forecasting error thus a further refinement of the approach presented here could link the probabilities of forecasting errors to water stress levels rather than irrigation interventions 6 conclusions the present paper analysed the role played by information technologies in the scheduling of irrigation in agriculture the paper depicts a simplified analysis with an eye to displaying the process by which information can contribute to building realistic expectations about future events hence influencing strategic decisions the results obtained reveal that a given cim technology does not perform in the same way in different regions mediterranean and continental regions for different crops maize processing tomatoes cotton citrus or different irrigation systems sprinkler and drip irrigation this highlights that such type of tool must be fine tuned to local conditions before considering their broader dissemination the assessment procedure developed in this study could help public authorities to identify the right set of instruments to drive the uptake of cim technologies at the local level for example the subsidisation of research aimed at improving the quality and usability of new cim technologies and or subsidizing investments in public infrastructures to guarantee accessibility to the relevant information i e meteorological station networks water table level monitoring stations etc could be suggested in those cases where it is found that the technology is not yet ready to be disseminated among end users subsidies for dissemination and advisory services might be worth implementing to trigger the adoption in those cases where it is found that the technology has already good performance but needs to be better known and appreciated by potential end users in cases of low adoption it can also help to understand if the problem is the technology itself or external conditions e g water or agricultural product prices and the extent to which a policy is needed at all in any case the results obtained with this study suggest that cim technologies can actually contribute to increase substantially the efficiency of irrigation practices in sub humid and sub arid regions where the presence of climate variability justifies the use of advanced technologies to drive irrigation interventions in the near future for drip irrigated crops where the consequences of failing to meet irrigation requirements are low compared to sprinkler irrigated crops in addition other studies montesano et al 2015 cambouris et al 2014 fallahi et al 2015 demonstrated that the use of such technologies is particularly welcome for crops where the amount of water applied influences the quality of the production which can be linked to the role of prices in our model a further improvement of this study would be that of extending the method from the evaluation stage of the information technology to the early adoption stage and to analyse the linkages between farm risk attitudes and the quality of information and the relevant impact on water and land uses as well as issues related to knowledge sharing and familiarity cabantous

10822,crop selection in irrigated conditions entails characterization of crop water use and productivity dynamics under limited freshwater availability in a changing climate and environment there is ample scope to optimally irrigate row crops given the associated economic returns under full irrigation and relatively non alarming groundwater declines to require limited irrigation at least in many parts of the united states including nebraska however a fair and careful comparative assessment of cereal row crops for their efficiency of water use and associated metrics under optimal growth conditions is lacking we conducted field research in semi arid south central nebraska during 2016 2018 to comprehensively characterize water use and productivity dynamics in four major c3 soybean and winter wheat and c4 maize long season or l s and shorter season or s s and sorghum crops under consistent and well managed conditions crop specific signatures were found in seasonal profiles of total soil water and soil water depletion the highest seasonal total evapotranspiration eta was demonstrated by winter wheat 604 mm followed by l s maize 594 mm soybean 591 mm s s maize 547 mm and sorghum 518 mm normalization and scaling of eta was accomplished so as to better reflect comparative eta per unit of heat accumulation thermal units or tu eta was also studied relative to evaporative demand using single and basal crop coefficients kc and kcb respectively consequently empirical functions were developed for kc and kcb using base scales of days after emergence cumulative tu ctu and normalized ctu crop specific sensitivity of kcb to morphological area was studied crop water productivity based on grain yield wpgy and aboveground biomass wpagb was quantified and it was found that the two c4 crops were 89 more water efficient than their c3 counterparts finally the importance of vpd to explain the variability and improve prediction of wpagb in various crops was established keywords c3 crops c4 crops crop coefficients evapotranspiration crop water productivity maize sorghum soybean wheat 1 introduction water is one of the most crucial inputs for optimum crop growth and performance besides other primary resources such as light radiation and nitrogen han et al 2016 it has also been most prioritized for management given its limited quantities and non uniform distribution across various regions of the globe milly et al 2005 and across various terrestrial ecosystems tang et al 2014 xiao et al 2013 agro ecosystems especially row crop agriculture as is the case with all plant functional groups demonstrate resource use mechanisms that are intrinsic to specific crops due to differences in phylogenetic affinity monocots and dicots growth features canopy geometry branching pattern and physiology c3 and c4 photosynthesis deng et al 2012 these differences eventually translate to differences in water use patterns and quantities with environmental changes increasingly affecting crop production in the u s high plains kukal and irmak 2018a and beyond schlenker and roberts 2009 lobell and asner 2003 kukal and irmak 2018b ortiz bobea et al 2018 crop mix shifts have been occurring and will most likely continue in the future cho and mccarl 2017 increasing air temperatures kukal and irmak 2016a b have been shown to influence greater selection cultivation of cotton rice sorghum and winter wheat while barley sorghum winter wheat spring wheat and hay are more likely to be selected as regions become drier and corn cotton rice and soybean are more likely to be selected in wetter regions cho and mccarl 2017 crop selection based on estimates of relative robustness of crops to weather variability has to be supplemented with reliable information on crop water use and capability to produce greater dry matter or grain yield kukal and irmak 2019a per unit of water use nebraska especially south central and south eastern regions is characterized by high density of irrigation wells as high as 6 wells per km2 young et al 2013 and extensive cultivation of row crops nevertheless low to moderately low groundwater level declines 3 6 meters have been observed since pre development around 1950 of irrigation practices with some areas even witnessing increasing groundwater levels owing to deep percolation from irrigation distribution systems and excess water applied to crops young et al 2013 these declines are substantially lower than those in some parts of the aquifer in kansas oklahoma and texas where water level declines greater than 46 m have been recorded mcguire 2017 some of the fundamental counter strategies to agricultural water depletion include adoption of soil and crop sensing based irrigation management adoption of micro irrigation methods subsurface drip irrigation sdi and deficit or limited irrigation although nebraska leads the nation in use of soil and crop sensing technology to aid in irrigation scheduling usda 2013 the fraction 24 is low and substantial potential for increased adoption of technology for irrigation and crop management exists although deficit irrigation has been researched in the region djaman and irmak 2012 rudnick and irmak 2014 irmak et al 2016 djaman et al 2013 payero et al 2009 2008 payero et al 2006 there does not seem a dire need for the nebraska producers to adopt deficit irrigation in their operations in many parts of the state this is because of two major reasons i non alarming groundwater depletion rates in the state and ii large crop water productivity benefit associated with appropriate soil moisture sensing based irrigation management as demonstrated by irmak et al 2012 they reported 34 increase in irrigation water productivity and 4 increase in crop water productivity when irrigating optimally using soil moisture sensors moreover it has been also shown that under non water limiting conditions in south central nebraska the net income is achieved under full irrigation fit and hence fit be practiced for maximized profit irmak 2014a b rudnick et al 2016 thus in the imminent future the likeliness of producers irrigating fully using soil moisture sensing is greater than that of irrigating in deficit in certain parts of the state in the light of these facts it is imperative to conduct assessments of water use and productivity comparatively across major cropping systems kukal and irmak 2017 when managed under optimal growth conditions sufficiently irrigated and fertilized and well maintained for other agronomic practices to represent an ideally managed production field these assessments are challenging as they entail that proper focus be placed on maintaining homogenous and consistent conditions including soil properties soil and crop management weather conditions methodology and other variables to be fixed across different crops and are especially difficult to achieve in production scale fields homogeneity in the above factors is paramount to such investigations if a fair and unbiased comparison across crops is desired previous research and data that addresses comparative water use patterns across major crops in their respective ecosystems are rare hattendorf et al 1988 compared the water use characteristics of six row crops maize grain sorghum pearl millet pinto bean soybean and sunflower in kansas usa they found that mean daily water use if sunflower was 22 greater than the mean of the rest of the crops dry matter water productivity was 17 5 mg ha 1 m 1 for c3 crops and 33 3 mg ha 1 m 1 for c4 crops hamilton et al 2015 compared water use evapotranspiration and productivity in five perennial biofuel crops including switchgrass miscanthus native grasses restored prairie and hybrid poplar and annual maize in temperate humid climate of michigan usa they reported that miscanthus had the highest water productivity followed by maize poplar and native grasses and prairie our research aims to compare four row crop systems that represent the major source of food and feed in nebraska using a wider set of metrics than previously employed in past studies and thus characterize the water use crop productivity environmental interactions occurring in these crops when grown under non limiting water and nutrient conditions the selection of four row crops in this research maize soybean grain sorghum and winter wheat is justifiable due to several reasons first these are the four major row crops in nebraska accounting for 86 of the total harvested nebraska cropland usda nass 2018 and in the u s great plains in general fig 1 presents the spatial distribution of nebraska and neighboring states cropland that was under these crops cultivation in 2018 usda cropscape 2018 secondly these crops have a substantial share of irrigated cropland in the state 95 which is also evident in fig 1 from the overlap of center pivot irrigation systems and the cropland under these crops although a considerable area crop under gravity furrow irrigation also exists in the state hence these crops were grown under optimal conditions so as to allow them to reach their highest production potential thirdly these crops also provide immense opportunity to identify and study differences in crop growth dynamics as they differ in several aspects these include their mechanism of photosynthetic pathways c3 vs c4 canopy architecture spherical heliotropic leaf angle distribution erectophile planophile ground cover fraction leaf morphology resource use water light and nitrogen plant densities etc lastly these crops comprise of a significant land area in the global scale and are a common and significant grain crops that are and will continue to be grown for meeting the rapidly growing world s population s food fiber feed and fuel demand with these multifaceted differences these crops are ideal for an analysis that aims to differentiate their water use patterns under homogenous growing conditions since the aim was to achieve optimal crop performance and water use this research was conducted under sdi conditions facilitation in removal to a large degree or minimization of a confounding factor i e surface soil evaporation e was the intention which has been shown to be 10 lower in sdi than center pivot irrigated crop at the experimental site odhiambo and irmak 2015 moreover due to canopy structural differences in the four crops selected in this research evaporation patterns are expected to be variable on account of varying degree of soil surface exposed which could possibly confound the actual water use comparisons if this research was carried out under a sprinkler irrigation method e g center pivot conducting this research under sdi conditions is one of our attempts to minimize e and surface runoff losses diverting the additional water towards transpiration hence potentially resulting in increased yield odhiambo and irmak 2015 this research quantifies and employs a panel of metrics that directly or indirectly associate crop water use with soil water dynamics atmospheric water demand crop productivity and their biological and environmental controls for each of the four crops the specific objectives of this research are to characterize four row cropping systems maize soybean grain sorghum and winter wheat using the following metrics a total soil water in the crop root zone b soil water depletion and its depth wise distribution c evapotranspiration actual and scaled d single and basal crop coefficients based on alfalfa and grass reference surfaces and their relationship with crop morphology e crop water productivity on grain yield basis and aboveground biomass basis and f crop water productivity vs vapor pressure deficit relationships 2 material and methods 2 1 research site characteristics the field investigations for this research were carried out at the university of nebraska lincoln south central agricultural laboratory scal 40 58 n 98 13 w 552 m above mean sea level near clay center nebraska the soil at the site is a hastings silt loam well drained upland soil fine montmorillonitic mesic udic argiustoll with 0 34 m3 m 3 field capacity 0 14 m3 m 3 permanent wilting point and 0 53 m3 m 3 saturation point irmak 2010 the total available water holding capacity of the soil profile is 240 mm 1 20 m 1 the particle size distribution is 15 sand 65 silt and 20 clay with 2 5 organic matter content in the topsoil irmak 2010 the long term average annual rainfall in the area is 680 mm with significant annual and growing season variability in both magnitude and timing the 13 5 hectare experimental field fig 1d was irrigated using a subsurface drip irrigation sdi system that was installed in 2004 by dr suat irmak and is the first sdi field in nebraska and is one of the largest experimental sdi fields in the u s 2 2 soil crop and irrigation management the field experiments were conducted for the two growing seasons in 2016 and 2017 for maize zea mays l soybean glycine max l merr and grain sorghum sorghum bicolor l moench and 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 for winter wheat triticum aestivum l for maize a short season variety 80 day hybrid was selected during both years and a longer season variety 113 day hybrid was included in 2017 to accommodate all these crops within the extent of the experimental field the field was divided in the n s direction into smaller independent plots with at least 2 5 ha area each dedicated to a single crop the specific plot areal extents for each crop during both growing seasons are provided in table 1 these subdivisions within the field with uniform soil type ensured that various crops were subject to homogenous soil conditions during each growing season care was taken where possible soil and crop management was uniform across all crops while still representing the regionally prevalent management followed in grower production fields all crops were fertilized appropriately and sufficiently and the nitrogen amount applied to each crop table 1 was based on the soil samples taken from several locations in each cropped area of the field and the university of nebraska lincoln nitrogen recommendation algorithms the residual soil nitrogen was credited and subtracted from the final nitrogen amount needed herbicide insecticide and fungicide applications were made to all crops uniformly when needed to maintain optimum growth conditions it was ensured that none of the crops were water stressed this was achieved by continuously monitoring soil water status using soil moisture probes so that the available soil water in the top 1 20 m profile was kept between approximately 90 of the field capacity and the maximum allowable depletion of 55 of total available water taw irrigations were initiated each time the soil water in the crop root zone was depleted by about 40 to 45 below field capacity the total irrigation amounts applied to the crops during each growing season is listed in table 1 the depletion criterion of 40 to 45 taw was practiced to prevent the plants from experiencing any water stress the irrigation water was pumped from the ogallala aquifer and the depth to the water table was about 35 m in addition to nutrients and water the experiment was intensively managed to ensure avoidance of any stresses from weeds insects and diseases table 1 lists various detailed agronomic and management information for each of the crops during the two growing seasons 2 3 field measurements 2 3 1 soil moisture flux soil moisture was measured at sub hourly intervals using john deere field connect john deere water san marcos cal which is a capacitance based sensor and would be referred to as jd probe hereon capacitance probes are a form of electromagnetic em sensor that indirectly measure soil moisture content based on the dielectric properties of the soil medium the jd probes contain capacitors along the probe shaft which can be placed in 0 10 m intervals however the manufacturer recommended capacitor placement depths were used for this research which were 0 10 0 20 0 30 0 50 and 1 00 m these capacitor depths were selected so as to represent soil layers of 0 0 15 m 0 15 0 25 m 0 25 0 40 m 0 40 0 75 m and 0 75 1 20 m respectively for our calculations the assumption was that each of the capacitors along the probe represented moisture status at the mid point of these individual soil layers the jd probes output a count proportional to the sensor circuit resonant frequency which is used to calculate scaled frequency sf ranging between zero and one the sf was then converted to volumetric water content using the manufacturer s embedded calibration equation the jd probes were encased in plastic access tubes which were permanently placed in the soil throughout the growing season the jd probes installation was done immediately after emergence as the probes were placed in the inter plant space in the row the probes were equipped with an antenna that provided real time remote data access and a solar panel that recharged the battery each cropped plot was subjected to moisture status monitoring using 4 6 jd probes depending on the areal extent of the plot we employed depth specific calibration functions that have been derived from extensive research data irmak 2018 at the same experimental site scal and conditions aiming at comparing soil moisture reported using a wide range of soil moisture sensors to standardized soil moisture measured using neutron scattering technique 2 3 2 aboveground dry matter leaf area index and grain yield every 1 1 5 weeks during both growing seasons four quadrats of area with 1 square meter each were destructively sampled this sampling campaign was conducted for each crop totaling to 16 samples every 1 1 5 weeks across all four crops 4 crops 4 samples in 2016 or 2016 2017 for winter wheat growing season and 20 samples every 1 1 5 weeks across all crops 5 crops 4 samples in 2017 or 2017 2018 for winter wheat growing season each harvested area was at least 4 5 meters from areas harvested in previous campaigns so that the harvested gaps do not contribute to any edge effects in areas to be harvested in the future the destructive sampling was also limited to a particular but representative section of the field in order to prevent random gaps in the field which could have hindered the crop yield assessments from the records of the yield monitor the samples were dried in a walk in oven at 60 c until constant weight was attained and following which dry matter from all the samples was weighed and recorded we will refer to this aboveground biomass dry matter as agb hereon leaf area index lai was measured using an accupar lp 80 ceptometer meter group pullman wa usa every 1 1 5 weeks at 20 random and representative locations in each crop canopy the ceptometer consists of a light bar with 80 point quantum flux sensors which aid in detailed sampling and spatial averaging of light photosynthetic photon flux density or ppfd incident on a surface since the light transmission into a row crop canopy is subject to high heterogeneity owing to non uniform patterns of direct and diffused light transmitted to the ground surface a ceptometer is an ideal instrument to measure light transmission or lai in row crop canopies the instrument requires a light ppfd measurement to be recorded above the canopy uninterrupted by any plant part to represent the incident light on the canopy and several flexible number of measurements at the ground level to represent the transmitted light ppfd in the inter row spacing the lai measurements were conducted on clear sky days with non overcast or non cloudy conditions to maintain consistent measurement conditions throughout the growing seasons lai has been shown to have a diurnal variation owing to changes in solar angles weiss et al 2004 hence it was necessary to measure lai at the same time around solar noon every week for all crops greater details on the agb and lai data collection methods are described in kukal and irmak 2019b grain yield gy for all crops was measured at harvest using a combine harvester with appropriate header and equipped with a yield monitor a representative estimate of grain yield was obtained using aggregation of spatial yield maps for each crop after filtering the outer boundaries of the plots as well as aboveground biomass sampling areas to avoid any edge effects and hence misrepresentation of grain yield data the yield data were adjusted for appropriate moisture contents 15 5 for maize 13 for soybean 14 for grain sorghum and 13 5 for winter wheat 2 4 computation of reference evapotranspiration and thermal units daily grass reference et eto and alfalfa reference et etr at each of the experimental fields were computed using the standardized asce penman monteith equation asce 2005 with fixed stomatal resistance values for both grass and alfalfa reference surfaces 1 e t r e f 0 408 δ r n g γ c n t m e a n 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 c d u 2 where etref is either grass eto or alfalfa reference et etr mm d 1 rn is net radiation mj m 2 d 1 g is soil heat flux mj m 2 d 1 and is assumed to be zero for a daily time step γ is the psychometric constant kpa c 1 tmean is daily average air temperature c u2 is wind speed

time step coefficients cn and cd are 900 c mm s3 mg 1 d 1 and 0 34 s m 1 for a grass reference surface and 1600 c mm s3 mg 1 d 1 and 0 38 s m 1 for an alfalfa reference surface respectively on a daily time scale asce 2005 weather data used in eq 1 were measured using an agricultural weather data network awdn station managed by high plains regional climate center hprcc which was located only approximately 300 m from the experimental field heat available for growth and development for each crop since planting or emergence was computed at daily scale and was represented by cumulative growing degree days referred to as cumulative thermal units ctu in the present study the air temperature data used for computation of ctu was measured at an agricultural weather data network awdn station managed by high plains regional climate center hprcc in this research ctu values were calculated using the most widely accepted method mcmaster and wilhelm 1997 shown by eq 2 2 c t u e m e r g e n c e h a r v e s t t m a x t m i n 2 t b a s e where tmax and tmin is daily maximum and minimum air temperatures and tbase is the crop specific base temperature and was taken as 10c for maize soybean and sorghum and 0c for winter wheat for days when average of tmax and tmin was lower than tbase it was replaced by the tbase and hence tu for that day was computed as 0 we did not impose any upper limit for temperature e g 30 c for maize because there exists strong evidence to imply that transpiration and hence assimilation processes are not hindered at such temperatures at least under the environmental conditions at the experimental site irmak and mutiibwa 2010 irmak personal communication 2 5 soil water balance a general soil water balance represented by eq 3 was used to compute actual crop et eta as a residual from the closed equation 3 p i u r o n r o f f δ s w e t a where p is rainfall mm i is irrigation water applied mm u is upward soil moisture flux mm ron is surface runon within the field mm roff is surface runoff from the field mm δsw is the change in soil moisture storage in the soil profile mm and d is the deep percolation mm below the crop root zone the deep percolation was estimated by daily soil water balance approach using a computer program that was written in microsoft visual basic the inputs to the program were daily weather data including air temperature incoming shortwave irradiance relative humidity wind speed and rainfall irrigation dates and amounts initial water content in the soil profile at crop emergence and crop and site specific information such as planting date maturity date soil parameters maximum rooting depth etc payero et al 2009 bryant et al 1992 the computer program calculated daily eta and the water balance in the crop root zone using the two step approach eta kc eto where eto is evapotranspiration of a grass reference crop and kc is the crop coefficient in the program eto is calculated using the weather data as input to the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 monteith and unsworth 1990 and kc is used to adjust the estimated eto for the reference crop to that of the desired crops at different growth stages and growing environments the daily soil water balance equation for deep percolation is 4 d j m a x p j r j i j e t a j c d j 1 0 where dj is deep percolation on day j cdj 1 is root zone cumulative depletion depth at the end of day j 1 pj is precipitation rj is precipitation and or irrigation run off from the soil surface on day j mm ij is irrigation depth on day j mm and etaj is crop evapotranspiration on day j mm estimated by the two step approach the surface run off from individual treatment was estimated using the usda natural resources conservation service nrcs curve number method usda nrcs 1985 according to the silt loam soil at the site and the known land use slope and the conservation tillage c 75 was used which was obtained from usda nrcs 1985 assuming that the upward flux and run on are negligible the soil water balance equation is reduced to the following form for calculating crop evapotranspiration eta 5 e t a p i r d δ s w 2 6 crop coefficients both single and basal alfalfa based crop coefficients kcr unitless and grass based crop coefficients kco unitless were derived from measured eta mm and estimated etref mm for several intervals in the growing season and crop coefficient curves were developed to analyze the seasonal patterns for each crop crop coefficients kc are empirically defined as ratios of eta to etref eto or etr as 6 k c e t a e t r e f where kc kco or kcr is the dimensionless crop coefficient for a particular crop at a given growth stage soil water status and climatic condition and eta is the crop evapotranspiration the kc value in eq 6 includes effects of evaporation from both plant and soil surfaces and thus is influenced by the available soil water within the plant root zone and the wetness of the exposed soil surface in addition to normal i e average or single kc values basal crop coefficients kcb were also developed to represent the ratio of eta to etref in those conditions when the soil surface layer is dry so that evaporation of water from the soil surface is minimal yet the average soil water content in the root zone is adequate to sustain crop transpiration at a potential rate the kcbo and kcbr estimated from eta values were determined only from soil water depletion periods i e the period between the two soil water measurement dates when there was no irrigation or precipitation sharma and irmak 2017 both single and basal crop coefficients were studied against cumulative thermal units and empirical functions were developed for future estimation of water use for each crop 2 7 crop water productivity crop water productivity was estimated for two productivity scales i aboveground biomass wpagb and ii grain yield wpgy wpagb was estimated as the slope of the relationship between cumulative agb and cumulative eta sampled at successive points during the growing season for each crop on the other hand wpgy was estimated as the ratio of grain yield for a given crop measured at harvest and the total seasonal eta eq 7 7 w p g y g y e t a 1000 where wpgy is expressed in kg m 3 on a unit water volume basis and gy grain yield kg m 2 and eta mm is crop evapotranspiration 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather conditions during the experiment the environmental conditions at the experimental site were studied for each crop and their two growing seasons table 2 presents a summary of several meteorological parameters which can aid in interpretation of any differences encountered in water use metrics each of the parameters presented in table 2 are averaged for the entire growing season i e since planting until harvesting the two growing seasons were found to be slightly different in their growing season air temperatures with the average temperatures tavg being 4 7 higher in 2016 than 2017 for maize soybean and sorghum while this difference was 17 for winter wheat these differences were primarily caused due to differences in tmin tmax differences were within 3 except for 9 for winter wheat which were 9 11 13 and most importantly 173 greater in 2016 for maize soybean sorghum and winter wheat respectively daily average tu tudaily were also higher for all crops in 2016 with the differences being 7 11 13 and 16 for s s maize soybean sorghum and winter wheat however due to differences in total growing season length total seasonal ctu accumulated from planting to harvesting ctuplanting and emergence to harvesting ctuharvesting were 22 lower for maize in 2016 than 2017 22 higher for winter wheat in 2016 2017 than 2017 2018 while no differences existed for soybean and sorghum in terms of precipitation 2017 growing season was 23 37 and 37 wetter than 2016 for maize soybean and sorghum while 2016 2017 was 8 wetter for winter wheat than 2017 2018 interestingly wind speed u2 was 20 23 greater in 2016 than 2017 for maize soybean and sorghum however the variability in u2 did not largely affect the relative humidity rhmean 3 differences and vapor pressure deficit vpd 6 differences across the two seasons except for winter wheat for which 2016 2017 season had 9 greater vpd than 2017 2018 based on the interactions of these meteorological variables influences daily etr was 10 8 9 and 6 higher in 2016 2016 2017 than 2017 2017 2018 for maize soybean sorghum and winter wheat respectively indicating that the evaporative demand was greater in the former than the latter however accounting for the total growing season length management based these differences were reversed and hence 2016 growing season had 18 5 and 5 lower seasonal total etr than 2017 while 2016 2017 winter wheat season had 18 higher seasonal total etr than 2017 2018 thus higher crop growth rates due to higher daily tu and increased evaporative losses due to higher etr in the first growing season are expected although the seasonal total metrics might be subject to variability due to variable length of crop growing seasons 3 2 soil water dynamics 3 2 1 total soil water the total soil water tsw in the complete monitored soil profile 0 1 2 m presented in fig 2 reflects the integration of soil moisture detected at individual incremental depths throughout the profile at daily scale the mean tsw presented here represents the daily mean of 30 minute measurements of tsw at 4 6 independent spatial locations within a single crop seasonal profiles of tsw are shown against days after emergence dae since soil moisture monitoring was initiated after plants emerged due to the installation of probes in the inter plant spaces to simulate roots it was observed that the tsw is maximum for both growing seasons at the start of the growing season due to the soil profile at above field capacity conditions due to winter and spring precipitation all crops demonstrate higher initial season tsw in 2016 2016 2017 than 2017 2017 2018 due to wetter soil conditions from greater spring precipitation in 2016 we find that crop specific signatures of tsw exist in both growing seasons since within a growing season maize soybean and sorghum were subject to the same patterns of wetting from precipitation irrigation and evaporative demand any differences in the tsw profiles are due to the crop specific soil water extraction patterns the difference in soil water extraction patterns for maize and soybean at the experimental site have been previously shown by djaman and irmak 2012 and irmak et al 2014 soil water extraction by plant roots and evaporative losses from the soil surface caused the tsw to gradually decrease until a wetting event caused a spike increase in tsw before the next water extraction period began a particular observation was that tsw did not decrease beyond readily available water raw for any crop owing to the success of the irrigation management that aimed at optimal non stressed conditions for crop growth the error bars around daily mean tsw magnitudes represent the spatial representativeness of our measurements and their reasonable magnitudes ensure the repeatability of our measurements and strengthen our interpretation the mean tsw across the entire monitoring period was the highest in sorghum 440 mm followed by s s maize 399 mm soybean 398 mm winter wheat 394 mm and l s maize 387 mm although the mean tsw was relatively uniform across crops significant sub seasonal variability was encountered winter wheat tsw profile was characterized by lower magnitudes during pre and post dormancy periods but higher and relatively constant magnitudes during the dormancy period overall seasonal mean tsw was higher in 2016 for all crops except s s maize in 2017 observations from simultaneous growth of s s and l s maize revealed that the latter sustained longer periods of lower tsw than s s maize from mid to late growth stages although tsw represents the status of soil water available for use for crop growth and development it is a function of precedent soil conditions and timing and magnitude of wetting events and hence does not inform about soil water use patterns by the vegetation in question 3 2 2 soil water depletion soil water depletion swd represents the amount of soil water that is removed from the soil profile beyond a certain threshold which is the field capacity fc 417 mm 1 20 m 1here and thus the swd is 0 if the tsw is more than or equal to fc and is the difference between fc and tsw otherwise fig 3 presents daily swd for each crop during the two growing seasons in response to the wetting events precipitation and irrigation in relation to days after emergence the error bars represent the standard deviation observed in measuring swd across multiple spatial locations for each crop the broken red line represents the upper bound for raw and as noted earlier the maximum depletion for any crop does not exceed raw which implies the effectiveness of our irrigation management aimed at not inducing any crop water stress the periods of continuous water depletion are characterized by ascent portions of the curves and any wetting especially precipitation causes abrupt periods of descent and decreasing swd for comparison across crops we calculated the seasonal total depletion fig 4 a by adding the net positive changes in daily swd throughout the monitoring period winter wheat had the maximum total seasonal depletion mean of 546 mm during 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 followed by l s maize 394 mm soybean 243 mm sorghum 236 mm and s s maize 222 mm the total seasonal depletion was greater in 2017 than 2016 for maize by 9 soybean 11 and sorghum 44 but the opposite was true for winter wheat with a difference of 21 this might be primarily because of the higher seasonal evaporative demand etref for maize soybean and sorghum in 2017 and winter wheat in 2016 2017 which lead to higher seasonal total depletion from soil profiles in addition to the complete soil profile seasonal depletion was also computed individually for each soil layer as percentage of the depletion in the complete soil profile fig 4b we find that considerable variability existed among the contribution of each soil layer s contribution to the total depletion the first layer 0 0 15 m was the largest contributor to total depletion for all crops and the magnitude of this contribution varied from 37 sorghum to 46 winter wheat the higher magnitude for winter wheat might be because of the evaporation of the additional moisture from the snowmelt during the dormant season the second layer s 0 15 0 25 m contribution varied from 19 soybean to 28 sorghum whereas that of the third layer 0 25 0 40 m varied from 18 soybean to 33 sorghum layers 4 0 40 0 75 m and 5 0 75 1 20 m were the contributed minimally relative to other layers in all crops sorghum and winter wheat demonstrated negligible 2 and 8 respectively contribution combinedly from layers 4 and 5 which is possibly due to their shorter root zone than other crops such as s s maize l s maize and soybean which accounted for 18 15 and 22 respectively contribution collectively from soil layers 4 and 5 these observations lend credibility to the approach of using layer specific swd dynamics to represent the water uptake activity and hence root volume and structural characteristics of various crops in this regard the relative structure of depletion contribution presented in fig 4b can act as estimations of root geometry of these crops although swd does not perfectly explain the soil water dynamics that result from crop specific traits due to confounding factors such as non accounting for crop water extraction during periods when tsw fc or swd 0 failure to include soil water dynamics between emergence and the start of soil moisture monitoring etc it is a useful metric to distinguish the layer specific distribution of soil water extraction by various crops while these challenges can be overcome by using soil water balance on a periodic basis and computing evapotranspiration eta eta cannot be used to determine layer specific contributions and cannot be studied on a daily basis due to highly transient conditions of soil water influx and outflux especially during and around periods of wetting unless eta is measured using one of the energy flux measurement method i e brebs eddy covariance scintillometry surface renewal 3 3 crop evapotranspiration crop evapotranspiration eta was computed for several weekly to biweekly intervals during the two growing seasons for each crop as mentioned earlier the intervals were selected based on inclusion of the wetting events well within the intervals so as to minimize the effect of transient soil water conditions on the efficacy of the soil water balance approach sharma and irmak 2017 as a result the intervals tend to be of non uniform duration days which makes it challenging to compare eta across different intervals this is also crucial in the light of short scale variability in tu during the growing season e g presence of overcast conditions and relatively cooler days among typically warm summer days thus we normalized the total weekly to biweekly interval eta using dividing by the total tu accumulated during an interval and scaled multiplied this quantity by 100 c this normalization and scaling procedure resulted in eta quantities that for a given crop represented water use during a given physiological stage if the crop was subjected to 100 units of tu which typically is a week s worth of heat accumulation in a typical summer month the scaled eta for several intervals selected for each growing season for all crops is shown in fig 5 a in relation to observed ctu these values owing to our scaling process are independent of the weather conditions that were observed at the experimental site and their growing season specific differences and hence have better transferability in space and time eta was as high as 70 80 mm for maize soybean and sorghum and 55 65 mm for winter wheat per 100 c heat accumulation and these higher end eta magnitudes occurred around 500 600 c for the summer crops and 1600 2000 c for winter wheat on a season average basis the highest eta per 100 c was observed for soybean 40 mm s s maize 38 mm l s maize 35 mm sorghum 32 mm and winter wheat 24 mm the mean eta was subject to considerable variability during the growing season with coefficient of variation varying from 48 to 71 this is because of the differential crop water use rates during different crop physiological development and growth stages which is a typical bell shaped curve with relatively lower eta rates during early development which peak during mid development and then again gradually lower towards senescence therefore we justifiably used third degree polynomial fits to describe these functions for winter wheat the initial growing season mostly pre dormancy was characterized by lower eta rates especially in 2017 2018 due to no pre dormancy growth owing to unconducive conditions 173 lower tmin than 2016 2017 cumulative eta non scaled for both growing seasons is presented in fig 5b and shows crop specific cumulative daily progression of crop water use for all crops in relation to total accumulation of heat and hence underscores the contrasting patterns of water uptake in these crop species total seasonal eta representing crop water use non scaled eta from planting to harvesting is presented in fig 5c for both individual growing seasons as well as average across both seasons on average the highest eta was demonstrated by winter wheat 604 mm followed by l s maize 594 mm soybean 591 mm s s maize 547 mm and sorghum 518 mm this comparative behavior was true for both individual growing seasons as well with the exception of winter wheat in 2017 2018 which had 10 lower eta than 2016 2017 this is primarily due to two major reasons i 18 lower winter wheat etref in 2017 2018 than 2016 2017 and ii no considerable pre dormant crop growth in 2017 2018 owing to which the pre dormant winter wheat water use was primarily evaporation from snow cover and was devoid of a transpiration component although the discussed measurements of eta represent the actual water lost used from these cropping systems under the environmental conditions at the experimental site a comparison among them demands appropriate caution it has to be understood that the inclusion of a shorter season maize variety and winter wheat tends to confound these comparisons primarily due to their contrasting growing season duration and hence extreme magnitudes of heat accumulation moreover the dormant period eta in winter wheat accounts for only non beneficial use of water evaporation due to absence of live plant material thus for ideal comparisons across these cropping systems as earlier we normalized the seasonal total eta quantities using ctuemergence ctu accumulated from emergence to harvest and scaled them to 1500 c a typical estimate of ctuemergence for summer crops the revised comparison fig 5d revealed that on an average across the two growing seasons s s maize 600 mm had the highest seasonal total eta followed by soybean 553 mm l s maize 534 mm sorghum 484 mm and winter wheat 363 mm the assessment for winter wheat eta drastically shifted reduced due to the highest ctuharvest 2491 c that was observed also the 12 higher scaled eta in s s maize than l s maize implies greater rates of water use owing to the need for higher rate of carbon assimilation in s s maize than l s maize the individual growing seasons also confirm to the same comparative eta estimates except that soybean had the highest scaled eta 556 mm instead of s s maize 528 mm since the eta measurement intervals were chosen so that they coincide with the three summer crops maize soybean and sorghum we have the opportunity to compare periodic eta across them fig 6 presents linear regression of periodic eta non scaled amongst various summer crops since the eta quantities represent water use for the same set of environmental conditions across various periods eta was correlated least r2 was 0 28 for various crops the correlation magnitudes listed as a correlation matrix in table 3 were the highest among s s maize vs l s maize followed by l s maize vs soybean sorghum vs soybean s s maize vs sorghum s s maize vs soybean and sorghum vs l s maize the linear functions presented in fig 6 provide for estimation of eta for a given crop per unit eta for another crop and allow for inter conversion among them the water balance derived eta etawb was also compared with the fao 56 two step approach derived eta etafao56 that involves multiplying etref with a crop coefficient kc to estimate eta it was observed that on average across all crops the absolute difference between etawb and etafao56 was 7 and ranged from 1 to 12 across crops and growing seasons table 4 among all the crops sorghum was subject to maximum difference 10 followed by maize and winter wheat both 8 and soybean 2 the two step approach overestimated eta for all crops during 2017 2017 2018 while it underestimated eta during 2016 2016 2017 for all crops except sorghum the eta overestimation in 2017 was possibly due to 32 greater precipitation in 2017 which was challenging to account for in the dual kc approach fao 56 this overestimation has been documented earlier by irmak et al 2008 and djaman and irmak 2012 for non stressed maize canopy at the experimental sites the two step approach is subject to errors that stem from i uncertainties in kc values in initial and late growing season from daily scale variability arising from evaporative losses from wet surface djaman and irmak 2012 and ii non constant daily kc values within initial mid season and late season stages payero and irmak 2011 these challenges underscore the importance of developing local kc values for locally prevalent environmental conditions and soil and crop management practices to improve the accuracy transferability and applicability of eta assessments and its use in irrigation and water management decisions 3 4 single and basal crop coefficients local kc values for each crop were quantified for optimal conditions using measured data for two growing seasons and their seasonal distribution was studied in relation to dae both grass and alfalfa reference kc kco and kcr respectively were developed as different regions use different reference surface kc values monthly kc values for growing season months were sampled table a1 for each crop based on both reference surfaces the peaks for kco were the highest for winter wheat 1 62 followed by soybean 1 55 l s maize 1 38 sorghum 1 35 and s s maize 1 30 and occurred in may july june july and july respectively for kcr the peak magnitude was the highest for soybean 1 25 followed by winter wheat 1 18 l s maize 1 10 sorghum 1 09 and s s maize 1 05 and occurred in july for all crops except winter wheat may the kc peaks occurred at around 40 50 dae for maize soybean and sorghum while the two peaks occurred at around 47 dap and 214 dae for winter wheat fig 7 presents seasonal distribution of kco and kcr against dae for each crop the data distribution was fit with a third order polynomial function for maize soybean and sorghum while a fourth order polynomial function was used for winter wheat and all these fits demonstrated moderate to high correlations r2 at least 0 43 usual choices of the order of the polynomial function used to characterize kc measurements in the literature are third djaman and irmak 2012 irmak et al 2013 piccinni et al 2009 fourth djaman and irmak 2012 rudnick and irmak 2014 and fifth order sharma and irmak 2017 kang et al 2003 these functions demonstrate a typical bell shaped curve with peak kc values being around the mid season stage winter wheat was observed to have two bell shaped portions in the kc curve representing pre dormancy and post dormancy growth periods as was also observed by irmak et al 2015 the seasonal patterns of kc values were also studied in relation to ctu and fig 8 presents kco and kcr for each crop shown against ctu in terms of ctu the kc peaks occurred at around 500 700 c for maize soybean and sorghum while the two peaks occurred at around 650 c and 1600 c for winter wheat again third and fourth order polynomial functions were fit to kc vs ctu data for each crop similarly to kc vs dae data the use of ctu to explain variability and patterns in kc was demonstrated to be slightly better than that by the use of dae this is evident from an average of 6 increased correlation across all crops when ctu was used instead of dae to model kc the ctu base scale is capable of accounting for variability in heat accumulation that can normally occur for a sub period within a growing season e g in a week or across multiple growing seasons and hence is more sophisticated using a dae base scale which is static in nature and only considers the number of days rather than the quality of the day in terms of promoting plant growth with respect to air temperature the pooled kcr and kco for the two growing seasons were also linearly regressed among each other fig 9 a and a strong correlation was found r2 0 98 for all crops kco was greater than kcr for all observations and the regression resulted in a slope of 1 24 1 26 for all the summer crops while the slope was 17 higher 1 47 for winter wheat the kcr kco ratios for all crops are presented in fig 9b as a function of ctu since the slopes from the linear regression in fig 9a were consistent across maize soybean and sorghum we choose to pool the kcr kco ratios for these crops in fig 9b while independently considering winter wheat the kcr kco ratio ranged from 0 75 in the initial growing season and gradually increased to 0 86 at around 1200 c and finally decreased gradually to around 0 71 at the end of growing season around 1800 c it has been reported by irmak et al 2008 that these ratios are subject to change due to alterations in aerodynamic and stomatal resistance since both aerodynamic and stomatal resistance vary across crops and even within the same crop during a growing season due to physiological differences and crop morphology wright 1996 variability in kcr kco ratio is expected the mean kcr kco ratio was 0 79 0 80 0 80 0 77 and 0 70 for s s maize l s maize soybean sorghum and winter wheat respectively the relatively greater value of the ratio for all summer crops than that of winter wheat is most likely because of the differences in weather conditions especially wind speed and vpd irmak et al 2003 thus crop specific patterns of water use differ when different reference surfaces are considered and hence the ratio reflects the relative response of the reference surfaces to evaporative demand rudnick and irmak 2014 found kcr kco ratios of 0 83 and 0 79 for 2011 and 2012 respectively in maize at the same experimental site which confirm our findings for maize to the best of our knowledge these ratios are unknown in these climatic conditions for the rest of the crops soybean sorghum and winter wheat and this research presents the first published values of these ratios since single or normal crop coefficients kcr kco are calculated using data which include precipitation events these derived crop coefficient values are impacted by the precipitation frequency and amount during the crop growing season due to these factors kc values are impacted by site specific surface wetness conditions of a given field and therefore would be relatively less transferrable and would also be subject to change in different precipitation regimes either at different locations or in a different year in the same location which is not ideal hence the influence of precipitation needs to be minimized to obtain kc values that are fairly independent of precipitation variations and soil surface moisture conditions to accomplish this we quantified basal crop coefficients kcb and adjusted them for soil surface wetness when the normal kcr and kco values were adjusted to obtain basal crop coefficients kcbr and kcbo the fluctuations in kc values which arose from soil evaporation from precipitation were minimized figs 10 and 11 present alfalfa reference kcbr and grass reference kcbo basal crop coefficient curves developed by fitting third and fourth order polynomial regression functions to the time distribution dae fig 10 and thermal unit distribution ctu fig 11 of the measured kcbr and kcbo data the kcbr and kcbo data exhibited similar distribution and seasonal patterns to that found in kcr and kco with lower short term variability which is supported by the significant increase observed in r2 values in kcb functions from that observed in kc functions overall r2 of the kcb functions was 13 higher than that of kc functions when dae base scale was used and 16 higher for the former than the latter when ctu base scale was used this improvement in correlation was as high as 42 for crop specific sorghum models of kcb vs ctu we also developed resources to aid in application of these crop specific kc values measured under optimal growth conditions to be used for accurate estimation of eta in sites with similar conditions in order to achieve this we present functions that estimate kc both single and basal using a more convenient and transferrable scale than both dae and ctu this scale is normalized ctu nctu which is basically the ratio of ctu on a given day since emergence to ctu at harvest and has been successfully used previously to model crop growth colaizzi et al 2017 kukal and irmak 2019b this nctu scale ranges from 0 to 1 and allows for a common base scale across crops and growing seasons moreover the use of nctu improves the transferability of these functions because of its non dependency on absolute ctu values which can vary across locations and years the user can simply convert the ctu observed at the site for a given year to a 0 1 scale following the procedure outlined here and estimate kc and kcb using functions presented here table a2 these functions for kco kcb kcbo kcbr are also visually depicted in fig 12 for inter comparison of sub seasonal patterns across various crops functions representing relationships of kco kcr kcbo and kcbr vs dae and ctu are also presented table a2 the choice for the function to be used for a particular application depends on the relative level of underlying base scale data availability at a given site e g dae requires emergence records ctu or nctu 3 5 crop coefficient and leaf morphology in this section we aimed to determine how the ability of a plant to transpire under given evaporative demand conditions represented by crop coefficient is dictated by its morphological characteristics we attempted to empirically relate kcb quantified for several intervals in the growing season to leaf area index lai averaged for the intervals kcb was selected due to its effectiveness in representing the relative magnitude of eta to etref with minimized if not zero contribution from soil evaporation and thus better reflects crop water use dynamics and is fit to be investigated for its relationship with lai kukal and irmak 2019b used quantitative models to describe morphological growth for the four row crops in the same experiment fig 13 a and 13b present grass and alfalfa reference kcb regressed with lai respectively for each crop we find that there was a linear relationship for all crops signifying that the crops show higher rates of eta per unit for etref as the morphological area lai increases lai explained at least 7 13 for kcbr variability in kcbo to as high as 55 54 in kcbr the rates of increase in kcbo per unit increase in lai varied from 0 05 in l s maize 0 05 for kcbr to 0 16 in s s maize 0 14 for kcbr the rate of increase was the sharpest in s s maize due to relatively lower maximum lai possible in s s maize than other crops which leads to higher rates of carbon assimilation per unit leaf area and hence higher rates of water use or kcb 3 6 crop water productivity crop water productivity wp was reported on two different basis aboveground biomass agb based wp wpagb and grain yield gy based wp wpgy agb and cumulative eta showed high correlation 0 86 for each crop and the slope of the relationship fig 14 a represents the seasonal wpagb estimate for a given crop wpagb was the highest for l s maize 9 22 kg m 3 followed by sorghum 7 39 kg m 3 s s maize 7 05 kg m 3 winter wheat 4 37 kg m 3 and soybean 3 55 kg m 3 wpgy across different crops also followed the same order of relative magnitudes as wpagb fig 14b and c wpgy was greater than wpagb by 339 267 274 228 and 422 for s s maize l s maize soybean sorghum and winter wheat respectively we estimated the relationship between the ratio of wpgy to wpagb and harvest index the proportion of gy to agb at harvest the harvest index hi varied from 0 25 in winter wheat to 0 38 in sorghum table 1 wpgy wpagb were strongly and positively correlated r2 0 98 and it was found that across all crops the ratio increased by 8 with every 10 increase in hi conventionally wpgy is the variable of interest when food production with respect to water use is to be considered however wpagb presents insights into two main economic and environmental aspects of agricultural production firstly crops such as maize both s s and l s maize and sorghum are also bioenergy crops and hence wpagb is of greater interest than wpgy in their production secondly agb is an effective indicator of sequestered carbon in terrestrial ecosystems and hence effective measurement of wpagb is prerequisite to evaluation of water use given unit carbon sequestered so that large scale assessments can be conducted 3 7 impact of vapor pressure deficit on wpagb vapor pressure deficit vpd integrates the effect of air temperature and relative humidity and hence is a robust indicator of the environmental regime for crop growth at a given site in this research the measurements of agb and eta were conducted at weekly to biweekly frequency over the growing season among these discrete periods of sampling environmental conditions represented here using vpd varied widely as is the case for all annual crops at a given site this is evident from fig 15 a which presents the vpd measured at the site during each of the sampling periods for wpagb measurement for all crops during both growing seasons for the summer crops the vpd increased initially in the growing season to a maximum value 1 75 kpa and then started decreasing until physiological maturity 0 5 0 6 kpa with substantial variability for winter wheat vpd decreased from around 0 5 to a minimal value 0 05 during pre dormant and dormant periods and thereon increased during post dormant period variability in vpd impacts crop water use and hence can govern the wpagb demonstrated by the crop to demonstrate the importance of vpd in this regard first we quantified the sensitivity of carbon agb assimilation to water use eta using measured data in this research we calculated independent estimates of gain in agb and eta required to achieve that gain during every sampling period these independent estimates were linearly regressed to obtain estimates of the slope the curves in the left column of fig 15b show the parameters of the linear regressions and it was found that variability in eta during the growing season was able to explain anywhere from 1 to 16 of the variability in agb gain the lack of a high correlation among these quantities is because of three primary reasons i inherent differences in carbon uptake during different crop physiological stages ii use of eta instead of t transpiration which does not reflect true crop water use and iii variability in environmental conditions i e differences in weather conditions during growing season length due to differences in planting emergence growth and harvest between the crops across growth periods leading to confounding estimates of the sensitivity of dry matter accumulation to crop water use quantification of this sensitivity was largely improved when eta was normalized using vpd for the sampling period and the resulting eta vpd ratio parameter is used to regress against agb this concept has been employed in previous research bierhuizen and slatyer 1965 tanner 1981 1983 kemanian et al 2005 that aimed at quantification of the slope of the regression between cumulative agb and t normalized using vpd however our use of this approach differs in two aspects i use of eta instead of t and ii use of independent values of agb and eta rather than cumulative values although eta is not the real representation of crop water use due to inclusion of non beneficial component of evaporation it is easier to estimate or measure eta than transpiration in the field conditions and hence quantifying the sensitivity or slope of agb to eta vpd has value albeit the low correlation owing to the use of eta the use of vpd normalized eta resulted in 550 1800 125 and 140 improvement in the correlation magnitude in s s maize l s maize soybean and sorghum respectively while no improvement was found for winter wheat also for all crops except winter wheat the slope or sensitivity increased when eta vpd was used instead of eta the slopes from the agb vs eta vpd relationships right column in fig 15b can also be interpreted as a more sophisticated assessment of wpagb due to the use of independent estimates of the quantities regressed as opposed to use of cumulative values which is subject to propagation of bias stemming from sampling errors this approach is also supported by mathematical proofs malet et al 1997 that reveal that slopes derived from cumulated variables in bio environmental relationships are statistical artifacts however these potential sources of misinterpretation are often overlooked especially while quantifying wp our analyses demonstrate the value and importance of i using independent values of agb and eta and ii accounting for vpd variation in estimating wpagb the sensitivity was found to be the highest for l s maize and sorghum 4 75 and 4 74 g m 2 mm 1 kpa followed by s s maize 4 55 g m 2 mm 1 kpa soybean 2 72 g m 2 mm 1 kpa and winter wheat 2 23 g m 2 mm 1 kpa these slopes presented in comparison to each other in fig 15c bring out the difference in carbon assimilation per unit of water use among c3 soybean and winter wheat and c4 maize and sorghum crops in general the two c4 crops were 89 more water efficient than the two c3 crops and while this behavior is documented in the literature pearcy and ehleringer 1984 pearcy and calkin 1983 we quantify these differences for irrigated row cereal crops grown under optimal conditions 4 conclusions this research measured important water flux and crop growth and productivity variables for four row crops maize soybean sorghum and winter wheat in south central nebraska during two growing seasons and employed them to quantify important dynamics such as soil water crop water use crop water use vs evaporative demand crop water use vs heat accumulation and crop productivity vs water use relationships total soil water and soil water depletion were quantified on a daily basis throughout the growing seasons of each crop winter wheat had the maximum total seasonal depletion mean of 546 mm during 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 followed by l s maize 394 mm soybean 243 mm sorghum 236 mm and s s maize 222 mm the contribution of each soil layer to total soil water depletion was also quantified and crop specific patterns were studied the highest season total eta was demonstrated by winter wheat 604 mm followed by l s maize 594 mm soybean 591 mm s s maize 547 mm and sorghum 518 mm the sub seasonal and seasonal total eta were also normalized and scaled by a measure of heat accumulation cumulative thermal units and it was found that s s maize showed the maximum season total eta 600 mm followed by soybean 553 mm l s maize 534 mm sorghum 484 mm and winter wheat 363 mm when eta was scaled to 1500 c quantitative relationships among eta rates in various crops were developed for a given magnitude of evaporative demand moreover it was demonstrated that the two step eta estimation method fao 56 was subject to considerable errors which necessitates the development of local single kc and basal kcb values for each crop to aid in accurate estimation of eta in similar conditions empirical functions were developed for alfalfa and grass reference kc and kcb with three base scales of varying sophistication dae ctu and nctu sensitivity of crops to evapotranspire given unit of water to morphological area lai was quantified and functions were presented wpgy and wpagb were calculated for each crop and it was found that l s maize had the highest wp followed by sorghum s s maize winter wheat and soybean finally the importance of vpd to explain the variability and improve prediction of wpagb was studied and experimental evidence presented to establish that the two c4 crops maize and sorghum were 89 more water efficient than the two c3 crops soybean and winter wheat this research establishes a benchmark given the challenges encountered in order to maintain consistent conditions across four crop species so as to justify fair comparisons of crop water use and productivity in semi arid conditions of nebraska efforts to achieve this comparative assessment included maintaining consistent soil and crop management practices intervals of water use and crop productivity sampling use of subsurface drip irrigation to minimize surface soil evaporation losses etc to the best of our knowledge this research is the first to conduct comparative water use and productivity dynamics in four major c3 and c4 cropping systems in nebraska and among the first ones in the u s high plains the data and information presented in this manuscript would aid in informed crop selection by producers in light of water use and productivity both for grain yield and biomass metrics across these crops as well as provide them with irrigation management tools crop coefficients to be managed

10822,crop selection in irrigated conditions entails characterization of crop water use and productivity dynamics under limited freshwater availability in a changing climate and environment there is ample scope to optimally irrigate row crops given the associated economic returns under full irrigation and relatively non alarming groundwater declines to require limited irrigation at least in many parts of the united states including nebraska however a fair and careful comparative assessment of cereal row crops for their efficiency of water use and associated metrics under optimal growth conditions is lacking we conducted field research in semi arid south central nebraska during 2016 2018 to comprehensively characterize water use and productivity dynamics in four major c3 soybean and winter wheat and c4 maize long season or l s and shorter season or s s and sorghum crops under consistent and well managed conditions crop specific signatures were found in seasonal profiles of total soil water and soil water depletion the highest seasonal total evapotranspiration eta was demonstrated by winter wheat 604 mm followed by l s maize 594 mm soybean 591 mm s s maize 547 mm and sorghum 518 mm normalization and scaling of eta was accomplished so as to better reflect comparative eta per unit of heat accumulation thermal units or tu eta was also studied relative to evaporative demand using single and basal crop coefficients kc and kcb respectively consequently empirical functions were developed for kc and kcb using base scales of days after emergence cumulative tu ctu and normalized ctu crop specific sensitivity of kcb to morphological area was studied crop water productivity based on grain yield wpgy and aboveground biomass wpagb was quantified and it was found that the two c4 crops were 89 more water efficient than their c3 counterparts finally the importance of vpd to explain the variability and improve prediction of wpagb in various crops was established

the region djaman and irmak 2012 rudnick and irmak 2014 irmak et al 2016 djaman et al 2013 payero et al 2009 2008 payero et al 2006 there does not seem a dire need for the nebraska producers to adopt deficit irrigation in their operations in many parts of the state this is because of two major reasons i non alarming groundwater depletion rates in the state and ii large crop water productivity benefit associated with appropriate soil moisture sensing based irrigation management as demonstrated by irmak et al 2012 they reported 34 increase in irrigation water productivity and 4 increase in crop water productivity when irrigating optimally using soil moisture sensors moreover it has been also shown that under non water limiting conditions in south central nebraska the net income is achieved under full irrigation fit and hence fit be practiced for maximized profit irmak 2014a b rudnick et al 2016 thus in the imminent future the likeliness of producers irrigating fully using soil moisture sensing is greater than that of irrigating in deficit in certain parts of the state in the light of these facts it is imperative to conduct assessments of water use and productivity comparatively across major cropping systems kukal and irmak 2017 when managed under optimal growth conditions sufficiently irrigated and fertilized and well maintained for other agronomic practices to represent an ideally managed production field these assessments are challenging as they entail that proper focus be placed on maintaining homogenous and consistent conditions including soil properties soil and crop management weather conditions methodology and other variables to be fixed across different crops and are especially difficult to achieve in production scale fields homogeneity in the above factors is paramount to such investigations if a fair and unbiased comparison across crops is desired previous research and data that addresses comparative water use patterns across major crops in their respective ecosystems are rare hattendorf et al 1988 compared the water use characteristics of six row crops maize grain sorghum pearl millet pinto bean soybean and sunflower in kansas usa they found that mean daily water use if sunflower was 22 greater than the mean of the rest of the crops dry matter water productivity was 17 5 mg ha 1 m 1 for c3 crops and 33 3 mg ha 1 m 1 for c4 crops hamilton et al 2015 compared water use evapotranspiration and productivity in five perennial biofuel crops including switchgrass miscanthus native grasses restored prairie and hybrid poplar and annual maize in temperate humid climate of michigan usa they reported that miscanthus had the highest water productivity followed by maize poplar and native grasses and prairie our research aims to compare four row crop systems that represent the major source of food and feed in nebraska using a wider set of metrics than previously employed in past studies and thus characterize the water use crop productivity environmental interactions occurring in these crops when grown under non limiting water and nutrient conditions the selection of four row crops in this research maize soybean grain sorghum and winter wheat is justifiable due to several reasons first these are the four major row crops in nebraska accounting for 86 of the total harvested nebraska cropland usda nass 2018 and in the u s great plains in general fig 1 presents the spatial distribution of nebraska and neighboring states cropland that was under these crops cultivation in 2018 usda cropscape 2018 secondly these crops have a substantial share of irrigated cropland in the state 95 which is also evident in fig 1 from the overlap of center pivot irrigation systems and the cropland under these crops although a considerable area crop under gravity furrow irrigation also exists in the state hence these crops were grown under optimal conditions so as to allow them to reach their highest production potential thirdly these crops also provide immense opportunity to identify and study differences in crop growth dynamics as they differ in several aspects these include their mechanism of photosynthetic pathways c3 vs c4 canopy architecture spherical heliotropic leaf angle distribution erectophile planophile ground cover fraction leaf morphology resource use water light and nitrogen plant densities etc lastly these crops comprise of a significant land area in the global scale and are a common and significant grain crops that are and will continue to be grown for meeting the rapidly growing world s population s food fiber feed and fuel demand with these multifaceted differences these crops are ideal for an analysis that aims to differentiate their water use patterns under homogenous growing conditions since the aim was to achieve optimal crop performance and water use this research was conducted under sdi conditions facilitation in removal to a large degree or minimization of a confounding factor i e surface soil evaporation e was the intention which has been shown to be 10 lower in sdi than center pivot irrigated crop at the experimental site odhiambo and irmak 2015 moreover due to canopy structural differences in the four crops selected in this research evaporation patterns are expected to be variable on account of varying degree of soil surface exposed which could possibly confound the actual water use comparisons if this research was carried out under a sprinkler irrigation method e g center pivot conducting this research under sdi conditions is one of our attempts to minimize e and surface runoff losses diverting the additional water towards transpiration hence potentially resulting in increased yield odhiambo and irmak 2015 this research quantifies and employs a panel of metrics that directly or indirectly associate crop water use with soil water dynamics atmospheric water demand crop productivity and their biological and environmental controls for each of the four crops the specific objectives of this research are to characterize four row cropping systems maize soybean grain sorghum and winter wheat using the following metrics a total soil water in the crop root zone b soil water depletion and its depth wise distribution c evapotranspiration actual and scaled d single and basal crop coefficients based on alfalfa and grass reference surfaces and their relationship with crop morphology e crop water productivity on grain yield basis and aboveground biomass basis and f crop water productivity vs vapor pressure deficit relationships 2 material and methods 2 1 research site characteristics the field investigations for this research were carried out at the university of nebraska lincoln south central agricultural laboratory scal 40 58 n 98 13 w 552 m above mean sea level near clay center nebraska the soil at the site is a hastings silt loam well drained upland soil fine montmorillonitic mesic udic argiustoll with 0 34 m3 m 3 field capacity 0 14 m3 m 3 permanent wilting point and 0 53 m3 m 3 saturation point irmak 2010 the total available water holding capacity of the soil profile is 240 mm 1 20

annual and growing season variability in both magnitude and timing the 13 5 hectare experimental field fig 1d was irrigated using a subsurface drip irrigation sdi system that was installed in 2004 by dr suat irmak and is the first sdi field in nebraska and is one of the largest experimental sdi fields in the u s 2 2 soil crop and irrigation management the field experiments were conducted for the two growing seasons in 2016 and 2017 for maize zea mays l soybean glycine max l merr and grain sorghum sorghum bicolor l moench and 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 for winter wheat triticum aestivum l for maize a short season variety 80 day hybrid was selected during both years and a longer season variety 113 day hybrid was included in 2017 to accommodate all these crops within the extent of the experimental field the field was divided in the n s direction into smaller independent plots with at least 2 5 ha area each dedicated to a single crop the specific plot areal extents for each crop during both growing seasons are provided in table 1 these subdivisions within the field with uniform soil type ensured that various crops were subject to homogenous soil conditions during each growing season care was taken where possible soil and crop management was uniform across all crops while still representing the regionally prevalent management followed in grower production fields all crops were fertilized appropriately and sufficiently and the nitrogen amount applied to each crop table 1 was based on the soil samples taken from several locations in each cropped area of the field and the university of nebraska lincoln nitrogen recommendation algorithms the residual soil nitrogen was credited and subtracted from the final nitrogen amount needed herbicide insecticide and fungicide applications were made to all crops uniformly when needed to maintain optimum growth conditions it was ensured that none of the crops were water stressed this was achieved by continuously monitoring soil water status using soil moisture probes so that the available soil water in the top 1 20 m profile was kept between approximately 90 of the field capacity and the maximum allowable depletion of 55 of total available water taw irrigations were initiated each time the soil water in the crop root zone was depleted by about 40 to 45 below field capacity the total irrigation amounts applied to the crops during each growing season is listed in table 1 the depletion criterion of 40 to 45 taw was practiced to prevent the plants from experiencing any water stress the irrigation water was pumped from the ogallala aquifer and the depth to the water table was about 35 m in addition to nutrients and water the experiment was intensively managed to ensure avoidance of any stresses from weeds insects and diseases table 1 lists various detailed agronomic and management information for each of the crops during the two growing seasons 2 3 field measurements 2 3 1 soil moisture flux soil moisture was measured at sub hourly intervals using john deere field connect john deere water san marcos cal which is a capacitance based sensor and would be referred to as jd probe hereon capacitance probes are a form of electromagnetic em sensor that indirectly measure soil moisture content based on the dielectric properties of the soil medium the jd probes contain capacitors along the probe shaft which can be placed in 0 10 m intervals however the manufacturer recommended capacitor placement depths were used for this research which were 0 10 0 20 0 30 0 50 and 1 00 m these capacitor depths were selected so as to represent soil layers of 0 0 15 m 0 15 0 25 m 0 25 0 40 m 0 40 0 75 m and 0 75 1 20 m respectively for our calculations the assumption was that each of the capacitors along the probe represented moisture status at the mid point of these individual soil layers the jd probes output a count proportional to the sensor circuit resonant frequency which is used to calculate scaled frequency sf ranging between zero and one the sf was then converted to volumetric water content using the manufacturer s embedded calibration equation the jd probes were encased in plastic access tubes which were permanently placed in the soil throughout the growing season the jd probes installation was done immediately after emergence as the probes were placed in the inter plant space in the row the probes were equipped with an antenna that provided real time remote data access and a solar panel that recharged the battery each cropped plot was subjected to moisture status monitoring using 4 6 jd probes depending on the areal extent of the plot we employed depth specific calibration functions that have been derived from extensive research data irmak 2018 at the same experimental site scal and conditions aiming at comparing soil moisture reported using a wide range of soil moisture sensors to standardized soil moisture measured using neutron scattering technique 2 3 2 aboveground dry matter leaf area index and grain yield every 1 1 5 weeks during both growing seasons four quadrats of area with 1 square meter each were destructively sampled this sampling campaign was conducted for each crop totaling to 16 samples every 1 1 5 weeks across all four crops 4 crops 4 samples in 2016 or 2016 2017 for winter wheat growing season and 20 samples every 1 1 5 weeks across all crops 5 crops 4 samples in 2017 or 2017 2018 for winter wheat growing season each harvested area was at least 4 5 meters from areas harvested in previous campaigns so that the harvested gaps do not contribute to any edge effects in areas to be harvested in the future the destructive sampling was also limited to a particular but representative section of the field in order to prevent random gaps in the field which could have hindered the crop yield assessments from the records of the yield monitor the samples were dried in a walk in oven at 60 c until constant weight was attained and following which dry matter from all the samples was weighed and recorded we will refer to this aboveground biomass dry matter as agb hereon leaf area index lai was measured using an accupar lp 80 ceptometer meter group pullman wa usa every 1 1 5 weeks at 20 random and representative locations in each crop canopy the ceptometer consists of a light bar with 80 point quantum flux sensors which aid in detailed sampling and spatial averaging of light photosynthetic photon flux density or ppfd incident on a surface since the light transmission into a row crop canopy is subject to high heterogeneity owing to non uniform patterns of direct and diffused light transmitted to the ground surface a ceptometer is an ideal instrument to measure light transmission or lai in row crop canopies the instrument requires a light ppfd measurement to be recorded above the canopy uninterrupted by any plant part to represent the incident light on the canopy and several flexible number of measurements at the ground level to represent the transmitted light ppfd in the inter row spacing the lai measurements were conducted on clear sky days with non overcast or non cloudy conditions to maintain consistent measurement conditions throughout the growing seasons lai has been shown to have a diurnal variation owing to changes in solar angles weiss et al 2004 hence it was necessary to measure lai at the same time around solar noon every week for all crops greater details on the agb and lai data collection methods are described in kukal and irmak 2019b grain yield gy for all crops was measured at harvest using a combine harvester with appropriate header and equipped with a yield monitor a representative estimate of grain yield was obtained using aggregation of spatial yield maps for each crop after filtering the outer boundaries of the plots as well as aboveground biomass sampling areas to avoid any edge effects and hence misrepresentation of grain yield data the yield data were adjusted for appropriate moisture contents 15 5 for maize 13 for soybean 14 for grain sorghum and 13 5 for winter wheat 2 4 computation of reference evapotranspiration and thermal units daily grass reference et eto and alfalfa reference et etr at each of the experimental fields were computed using the standardized asce penman monteith equation asce 2005 with fixed stomatal resistance values for both grass and alfalfa reference surfaces 1 e t r e f 0 408 δ r n g γ c n t m e a n 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 c d u 2 where etref is either grass eto or alfalfa reference et etr mm d 1 rn is net radiation mj m 2 d 1 g is soil heat flux mj m 2 d 1 and is assumed to be zero for a daily time step γ is the psychometric constant kpa c 1 tmean is daily average air temperature c u2 is wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 es ea is vapor pressure deficit kpa δ is slope of saturation vapor pressure curve at air temperature kpa c 1 and cn and cd are constants that change with the reference surface and time step coefficients cn and cd are 900 c mm s3 mg 1 d 1 and 0 34 s m 1 for a grass reference surface and 1600 c mm s3 mg 1 d 1 and 0 38 s m 1 for an alfalfa reference surface respectively on a daily time scale asce 2005 weather data used in eq 1 were measured using an agricultural weather data network awdn station managed by high plains regional climate center hprcc which was located only approximately 300 m from the experimental field heat available for growth and development for each crop since planting or emergence was computed at daily scale and was represented by cumulative growing degree days referred to as cumulative thermal units ctu in the present study the air temperature data used for computation of ctu was measured at an agricultural weather data network awdn station managed by high plains regional climate center hprcc in this research ctu values were calculated using the most widely accepted method mcmaster and wilhelm 1997 shown by eq 2 2 c t u e m e r g e n c e h a r v e s t t m a x t m i n 2 t b a s e where tmax and tmin is daily maximum and minimum air temperatures and tbase is the crop specific base temperature and was taken as 10c for maize soybean and sorghum and 0c for winter wheat for days when average of tmax and tmin was lower than tbase it was replaced by the tbase and hence tu for that day was computed as 0 we did not impose any upper limit for temperature e g 30 c for maize because there exists strong evidence to imply that transpiration and hence assimilation processes are not hindered at such temperatures at least under the environmental conditions at the experimental site irmak and mutiibwa 2010 irmak personal communication 2 5 soil water balance a general soil water balance represented by eq 3 was used to compute actual crop et eta as a residual from the closed equation 3 p i u r o n r o f f δ s w e t a where p is rainfall mm i is irrigation water applied mm u is upward soil moisture flux mm ron is surface runon within the field mm roff is surface runoff from the field mm δsw is the change in soil moisture storage in the soil profile mm and d is the deep percolation mm below the crop root zone the deep percolation was estimated by daily soil water balance approach using a computer program that was written in microsoft visual basic the inputs to the program were daily weather data including air temperature incoming shortwave irradiance relative humidity wind speed and rainfall irrigation dates and amounts initial water content in the soil profile at crop emergence and crop and site specific information such as planting date maturity date soil parameters maximum rooting depth etc payero et al 2009 bryant et al 1992 the computer program calculated daily eta and the water balance in the crop root zone using the two step approach eta kc eto where eto is evapotranspiration of a grass reference crop and kc is the crop coefficient in the program eto is calculated using the weather data as input to the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 monteith and unsworth 1990 and kc is used to adjust the estimated eto for the reference crop to that of the desired crops at different growth stages and growing environments the daily soil water balance equation for deep percolation is 4 d j m a x p j r j i j e t a j c d j 1 0 where dj is deep percolation on day j cdj 1 is root zone cumulative depletion depth at the end of day j 1 pj is precipitation rj is precipitation and or irrigation run off from the soil surface on day j mm ij is irrigation depth on day j mm and etaj is crop evapotranspiration on day j mm estimated by the two step approach the surface run off from individual treatment was estimated using the usda natural resources conservation service nrcs curve number method usda nrcs 1985 according to the silt loam soil at the site and the known land use slope and the conservation tillage c 75 was used which was obtained from usda nrcs 1985 assuming that the upward flux and run on are negligible the soil water balance equation is reduced to the following form for calculating crop evapotranspiration eta 5 e t a p i r d δ s w 2 6 crop coefficients both single and basal alfalfa based crop coefficients kcr unitless and grass based crop coefficients kco unitless were derived from measured eta mm and estimated etref mm for several intervals in the growing season and crop coefficient curves were developed to analyze the seasonal patterns for each crop crop coefficients kc are empirically defined as ratios of eta to etref eto or etr as 6 k c e t a e t r e f where kc kco or kcr is the dimensionless crop coefficient for a particular crop at a given growth stage soil water status and climatic condition and eta is the crop evapotranspiration the kc value in eq 6 includes effects of evaporation from both plant and soil surfaces and thus is influenced by the available soil water within the plant root zone and the wetness of the exposed soil surface in addition to normal i e average or single kc values basal crop coefficients kcb were also developed to represent the ratio of eta to etref in those conditions when the soil surface layer is dry so that evaporation of water from the soil surface is minimal yet the average soil water content in the root zone is adequate to sustain crop transpiration at a potential rate the kcbo and kcbr estimated from eta values were determined only from soil water depletion periods i e the period between the two soil water measurement dates when there was no irrigation or precipitation sharma and irmak 2017 both single and basal crop coefficients were studied against cumulative thermal units and empirical functions were developed for future estimation of water use for each crop 2 7 crop water productivity crop water productivity was estimated for two productivity scales i aboveground biomass wpagb and ii grain yield wpgy wpagb was estimated as the slope of the relationship between cumulative agb and cumulative eta sampled at successive points during the growing season for each crop on the other hand wpgy was estimated as the ratio of grain yield for a given crop measured at harvest and the total seasonal eta eq 7 7 w p g y g y e t a 1000 where wpgy is expressed in kg m 3 on a unit water volume basis and gy grain yield kg m 2 and eta mm is crop evapotranspiration 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather conditions during the experiment the environmental conditions at the experimental site were studied for each crop and their two growing seasons table 2 presents a summary of several meteorological parameters which can aid in interpretation of any differences encountered in water use metrics each of the parameters presented in table 2 are averaged for the entire growing season i e since planting until harvesting the two growing seasons were found to be slightly different in their growing season air temperatures with the average temperatures tavg being 4 7 higher in 2016 than 2017 for maize soybean and sorghum while this difference was 17 for winter wheat these differences were primarily caused due to differences in tmin tmax differences were within 3 except for 9 for winter wheat which were 9 11 13 and most importantly 173 greater in 2016 for maize soybean sorghum and winter wheat respectively daily average tu tudaily were also higher for all crops in 2016 with the differences being 7 11 13 and 16 for s s maize soybean sorghum and winter wheat however due to differences in total growing season length total seasonal ctu accumulated from planting to harvesting ctuplanting and emergence to harvesting ctuharvesting were 22 lower for maize in 2016 than 2017 22 higher for winter wheat in 2016 2017 than 2017 2018 while no differences existed for soybean and sorghum in terms of precipitation 2017 growing season was 23 37 and 37 wetter than 2016 for maize soybean and sorghum while 2016 2017 was 8 wetter for winter wheat than 2017 2018 interestingly wind speed u2 was 20 23 greater in 2016 than 2017 for maize soybean and sorghum however the variability in u2 did not largely affect the relative humidity rhmean 3 differences and vapor pressure deficit vpd 6 differences across the two seasons except for winter wheat for which 2016 2017 season had 9 greater vpd than 2017 2018 based on the interactions of these meteorological variables influences daily etr was 10 8 9 and 6 higher in 2016 2016 2017 than 2017 2017 2018 for maize soybean sorghum and winter wheat respectively indicating that the evaporative demand was greater in the former than the latter however accounting for the total growing season length management based these differences were reversed and hence 2016 growing season had 18 5 and 5 lower seasonal total etr than 2017 while 2016 2017 winter wheat season had 18 higher seasonal total etr than 2017 2018 thus higher crop growth rates due to higher daily tu and increased evaporative losses due to higher etr in the first growing season are expected although the seasonal total metrics might be subject to variability due to variable length of crop growing seasons 3 2 soil water dynamics 3 2 1 total soil water the total soil water tsw in the complete monitored soil profile 0 1 2 m presented in fig 2 reflects the integration of soil moisture detected at individual incremental depths throughout the profile at daily scale the mean tsw presented here represents the daily mean of 30 minute measurements of tsw at 4 6 independent spatial locations within a single crop seasonal profiles of tsw are shown against days after emergence dae since soil moisture monitoring was initiated after plants emerged due to the installation of probes in the inter plant spaces to simulate roots it was observed that the tsw is maximum for both growing seasons at the start of the growing season due to the soil profile at above field capacity conditions due to winter and spring precipitation all crops demonstrate higher initial season tsw in 2016 2016 2017 than 2017 2017 2018 due to wetter soil conditions from greater spring precipitation in 2016 we find that crop specific signatures of tsw exist in both growing seasons since within a growing season maize soybean and sorghum were subject to the same patterns of wetting from precipitation irrigation and evaporative demand any differences in the tsw profiles are due to the crop specific soil water extraction patterns the difference in soil water extraction patterns for maize and soybean at the experimental site have been previously shown by djaman and irmak 2012 and irmak et al 2014 soil water extraction by plant roots and evaporative losses from the soil surface caused the tsw to gradually decrease until a wetting event caused a spike increase in tsw before the next water extraction period began a particular observation was that tsw did not decrease beyond readily available water raw for any crop owing to the success of the irrigation management that aimed at optimal non stressed conditions for crop growth the error bars around daily mean tsw magnitudes represent the spatial representativeness of our measurements and their reasonable magnitudes ensure the repeatability of our measurements and strengthen our interpretation the mean tsw across the entire monitoring period was the highest in sorghum 440 mm followed by s s maize 399 mm soybean 398 mm winter wheat 394 mm and l s maize 387 mm although the mean tsw was relatively uniform across crops significant sub seasonal variability was encountered winter wheat tsw profile was characterized by lower magnitudes during pre and post dormancy periods but higher and relatively constant magnitudes during the dormancy period overall seasonal mean tsw was higher in 2016 for all crops except s s maize in 2017 observations from simultaneous growth of s s and l s maize revealed that the latter sustained longer periods of lower tsw than s s maize from mid to late growth stages although tsw represents the status of soil water available for use for crop growth and development it is a function of precedent soil conditions and timing and magnitude of wetting events and hence does not inform about soil water use patterns by the vegetation in question 3 2 2 soil water depletion soil water depletion swd represents the amount of soil water that is removed from the soil profile beyond a certain threshold which is the field capacity fc 417 mm 1 20 m 1here and thus the swd is 0 if the tsw is more than or equal to fc and is the difference between fc and tsw otherwise fig 3 presents daily swd for each crop during the two growing seasons in response to the wetting events precipitation and irrigation in relation to days after emergence the error bars represent the standard deviation observed in measuring swd across multiple spatial locations for each crop the broken red line represents the upper bound for raw and as noted earlier the maximum depletion for any crop does not exceed raw which implies the effectiveness of our irrigation management aimed at not inducing any crop water stress the periods of continuous water depletion are characterized by ascent portions of the curves and any wetting especially precipitation causes abrupt periods of descent and decreasing swd for comparison across crops we calculated the seasonal total depletion fig 4 a by adding the net positive changes in daily swd throughout the monitoring period winter wheat had the maximum total seasonal depletion mean of 546 mm during 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 followed by l s maize 394 mm soybean 243 mm sorghum 236 mm and s s maize 222 mm the total seasonal depletion was greater in 2017 than 2016 for maize by 9 soybean 11 and sorghum 44 but the opposite was true for winter wheat with a difference of 21 this might be primarily because of the higher seasonal evaporative demand etref for maize soybean and sorghum in 2017 and winter wheat in 2016 2017 which lead to higher seasonal total depletion from soil profiles in addition to the complete soil profile seasonal depletion was also computed individually for each soil layer as percentage of the depletion in the complete soil profile fig 4b we find that considerable variability existed among the contribution of each soil layer s contribution to the total depletion the first layer 0 0 15 m was the largest contributor to total depletion for all crops and the magnitude of this contribution varied from 37 sorghum to 46 winter wheat the higher magnitude for winter wheat might be because of the evaporation of the additional moisture from the snowmelt during the dormant season the second layer s 0 15 0 25 m contribution varied from 19 soybean to 28 sorghum whereas that of the third layer 0 25 0 40 m varied from 18 soybean to 33 sorghum layers 4 0 40 0 75 m and 5 0 75 1 20 m were the contributed minimally relative to other layers in all crops sorghum and winter wheat demonstrated negligible 2 and 8 respectively contribution combinedly from layers 4 and 5 which is possibly due to their shorter root zone than other crops such as s s maize l s maize and soybean which accounted for 18 15 and 22 respectively contribution collectively from soil layers 4 and 5 these observations lend credibility to the approach of using layer specific swd dynamics to represent the water uptake activity and hence root volume and structural characteristics of various crops in this regard the relative structure of depletion contribution presented in fig 4b can act as estimations of root geometry of these crops although swd does not perfectly explain the soil water dynamics that result from crop specific traits due to confounding factors such as non accounting for crop water extraction during periods when tsw fc or swd 0 failure to include soil water dynamics between emergence and the start of soil moisture monitoring etc it is a useful metric to distinguish the layer specific distribution of soil water extraction by various crops while these challenges can be overcome by using soil water balance on a periodic basis and computing evapotranspiration eta eta cannot be used to determine layer specific contributions and cannot be studied on a daily basis due to highly transient conditions of soil water influx and outflux especially during and around periods of wetting unless eta is measured using one of the energy flux measurement method i e brebs eddy covariance scintillometry surface renewal 3 3 crop evapotranspiration crop evapotranspiration eta was computed for several weekly to biweekly intervals during the two growing seasons for each crop as mentioned earlier the intervals were selected based on inclusion of the wetting events well within the intervals so as to minimize the effect of transient soil water conditions on the efficacy of the soil water balance approach sharma and irmak 2017 as a result the intervals tend to be of non uniform duration days which makes it challenging to compare eta across different intervals this is also crucial in the light of short scale variability in tu during the growing season e g presence of overcast conditions and relatively cooler days among typically warm summer days thus we normalized the total weekly to biweekly interval eta using dividing by the total tu accumulated during an interval and scaled multiplied this quantity by 100 c this normalization and scaling procedure resulted in eta quantities that for a given crop represented water use during a given physiological stage if the crop was subjected to 100 units of tu which typically is a week s worth of heat accumulation in a typical summer month the scaled eta for several intervals selected for each growing season for all crops is shown in fig 5 a in relation to observed ctu these values owing to our scaling process are independent of the weather conditions that were observed at the experimental site and their growing season specific differences and hence have better transferability in space and time eta was as high as 70 80 mm for maize soybean and sorghum and 55 65 mm for winter wheat per 100 c heat accumulation and these higher end eta magnitudes occurred around 500 600 c for the summer crops and 1600 2000 c for winter wheat on a season average basis the highest eta per 100 c was observed for soybean 40 mm s s maize 38 mm l s maize 35 mm sorghum 32 mm and winter wheat 24 mm the mean eta was subject to considerable variability during the growing season with coefficient of variation varying from 48 to 71 this is because of the differential crop water use rates during different crop physiological development and growth stages which is a typical bell shaped curve with relatively lower eta rates during early development which peak during mid development and then again gradually lower towards senescence therefore we justifiably used third degree polynomial fits to describe these functions for winter wheat the initial growing season mostly pre dormancy was characterized by lower eta rates especially in 2017 2018 due to no pre dormancy growth owing to unconducive conditions 173 lower tmin than 2016 2017 cumulative eta non scaled for both growing seasons is presented in fig 5b and shows crop specific cumulative daily progression of crop water use for all crops in relation to total accumulation of heat and hence underscores the contrasting patterns of water uptake in these crop species total seasonal eta representing crop water use non scaled eta from planting to harvesting is presented in fig 5c for both individual growing seasons as well as average across both seasons on average the highest eta was demonstrated by winter wheat 604 mm followed by l s maize 594 mm soybean 591 mm s s maize 547 mm and sorghum 518 mm this comparative behavior was true for both individual growing seasons as well with the exception of winter wheat in 2017 2018 which had 10 lower eta than 2016 2017 this is primarily due to two major reasons i 18 lower winter wheat etref in 2017 2018 than 2016 2017 and ii no considerable pre dormant crop growth in 2017 2018 owing to which the pre dormant winter wheat water use was primarily evaporation from snow cover and was devoid of a transpiration component although the discussed measurements of eta represent the actual water lost used from these cropping systems under the environmental conditions at the experimental site a comparison among them demands appropriate caution it has to be understood that the inclusion of a shorter season maize variety and winter wheat tends to confound these comparisons primarily due to their contrasting growing season duration and hence extreme magnitudes of heat accumulation moreover the dormant period eta in winter wheat accounts for only non beneficial use of water evaporation due to absence of live plant material thus for ideal comparisons across these cropping systems as earlier we normalized the seasonal total eta quantities using ctuemergence ctu accumulated from emergence to harvest and scaled them to 1500 c a typical estimate of ctuemergence for summer crops the revised comparison fig 5d revealed that on an average across the two growing seasons s s maize 600 mm had the highest seasonal total eta followed by soybean 553 mm l s maize 534 mm sorghum 484 mm and winter wheat 363 mm the assessment for winter wheat eta drastically shifted reduced due to the highest ctuharvest 2491 c that was observed also the 12 higher scaled eta in s s maize than l s maize implies greater rates of water use owing to the need for higher rate of carbon assimilation in s s maize than l s maize the individual growing seasons also confirm to the same comparative eta estimates except that soybean had the highest scaled eta 556 mm instead of s s maize 528 mm since the eta measurement intervals were chosen so that they coincide with the three summer crops maize soybean and sorghum we have the opportunity to compare periodic eta across them fig 6 presents linear regression of periodic eta non scaled amongst various summer crops since the eta quantities represent water use for the same set of environmental conditions across various periods eta was correlated least r2 was 0 28 for various crops the correlation magnitudes listed as a correlation matrix in table 3 were the highest among s s maize vs l s maize followed by l s maize vs soybean sorghum vs soybean s s maize vs sorghum s s maize vs soybean and sorghum vs l s maize the linear functions presented in fig 6 provide for estimation of eta for a given crop per unit eta for another crop and allow for inter conversion among them the water balance derived eta etawb was also compared with the fao 56 two step approach derived eta etafao56 that involves multiplying etref with a crop coefficient kc to estimate eta it was observed that on average across all crops the absolute difference between etawb and etafao56 was 7 and ranged from 1 to 12 across crops and growing seasons table 4 among all the crops sorghum was subject to maximum difference 10 followed by maize and winter wheat both 8 and soybean 2 the two step approach overestimated eta for all crops during 2017 2017 2018 while it underestimated eta during 2016 2016 2017 for all crops except sorghum the eta overestimation in 2017 was possibly due to 32 greater precipitation in 2017 which was challenging to account for in the dual kc approach fao 56 this overestimation has been documented earlier by irmak et al 2008 and djaman and irmak 2012 for non stressed maize canopy at the experimental sites the two step approach is subject to errors that stem from i uncertainties in kc values in initial and late growing season from daily scale variability arising from evaporative losses from wet surface djaman and irmak 2012 and ii non constant daily kc values within initial mid season and late season stages payero and irmak 2011 these challenges underscore the importance of developing local kc values for locally prevalent environmental conditions and soil and crop management practices to improve the accuracy transferability and applicability of eta assessments and its use in irrigation and water management decisions 3 4 single and basal crop coefficients local kc values for each crop were quantified for optimal conditions using measured data for two growing seasons and their seasonal distribution was studied in relation to dae both grass and alfalfa reference kc kco and kcr respectively were developed as different regions use different reference surface kc values monthly kc values for growing season months were sampled table a1 for each crop based on both reference surfaces the peaks for kco were the highest for winter wheat 1 62 followed by soybean 1 55 l s maize 1 38 sorghum 1 35 and s s maize 1 30 and occurred in may july june july and july respectively for kcr the peak magnitude was the highest for soybean 1 25 followed by winter wheat 1 18 l s maize 1 10 sorghum 1 09 and s s maize 1 05 and occurred in july for all crops except winter wheat may the kc peaks occurred at around 40 50 dae for maize soybean and sorghum while the two peaks occurred at around 47 dap and 214 dae for winter wheat fig 7 presents seasonal distribution of kco and kcr against dae for each crop the data distribution was fit with a third order polynomial function for maize soybean and sorghum while a fourth order polynomial function was used for winter wheat and all these fits demonstrated moderate to high correlations r2 at least 0 43 usual choices of the order of the polynomial function used to characterize kc measurements in the literature are third djaman and irmak 2012 irmak et al 2013 piccinni et al 2009 fourth djaman and irmak 2012 rudnick and irmak 2014 and fifth order sharma and irmak 2017 kang et al 2003 these functions demonstrate a typical bell shaped curve with peak kc values being around the mid season stage winter wheat was observed to have two bell shaped portions in the kc curve representing pre dormancy and post dormancy growth periods as was also observed by irmak et al 2015 the seasonal patterns of kc values were also studied in relation to ctu and fig 8 presents kco and kcr for each crop shown against ctu in terms of ctu the kc peaks occurred at around 500 700 c for maize soybean and sorghum while the two peaks occurred at around 650 c and 1600 c for winter wheat again third and fourth order polynomial functions were fit to kc vs ctu data for each crop similarly to kc vs dae data the use of ctu to explain variability and patterns in kc was demonstrated to be slightly better than that by the use of dae this is evident from an average of 6 increased correlation across all crops when ctu was used instead of dae to model kc the ctu base scale is capable of accounting for variability in heat accumulation that can normally occur for a sub period within a growing season e g in a week or across multiple growing seasons and hence is more sophisticated using a dae base scale which is static in nature and only considers the number of days rather than the quality of the day in terms of promoting plant growth with respect to air temperature the pooled kcr and kco for the two growing seasons were also linearly regressed among each other fig 9 a and a strong correlation was found r2 0 98 for all crops kco was greater than kcr for all observations and the regression resulted in a slope of 1 24 1 26 for all the summer crops while the slope was 17 higher 1 47 for winter wheat the kcr kco ratios for all crops are presented in fig 9b as a function of ctu since the slopes from the linear regression in fig 9a were consistent across maize soybean and sorghum we choose to pool the kcr kco ratios for these crops in fig 9b while independently considering winter wheat the kcr kco ratio ranged from 0 75 in the initial growing season and gradually increased to 0 86 at around 1200 c and finally decreased gradually to around 0 71 at the end of growing season around 1800 c it has been reported by irmak et al 2008 that these ratios are subject to change due to alterations in aerodynamic and stomatal resistance since both aerodynamic and stomatal resistance vary across crops and even within the same crop during a growing season due to physiological differences and crop morphology wright 1996 variability in kcr kco ratio is expected the mean kcr kco ratio was 0 79 0 80 0 80 0 77 and 0 70 for s s maize l s maize soybean sorghum and winter wheat respectively the relatively greater value of the ratio for all summer crops than that of winter wheat is most likely because of the differences in weather conditions especially wind speed and vpd irmak et al 2003 thus crop specific patterns of water use differ when different reference surfaces are considered and hence the ratio reflects the relative response of the reference surfaces to evaporative demand rudnick and irmak 2014 found kcr kco ratios of 0 83 and 0 79 for 2011 and 2012 respectively in maize at the same experimental site which confirm our findings for maize to the best of our knowledge these ratios are unknown in these climatic conditions for the rest of the crops soybean sorghum and winter wheat and this research presents the first published values of these ratios since single or normal crop coefficients kcr kco are calculated using data which include precipitation events these derived crop coefficient values are impacted by the precipitation frequency and amount during the crop growing season due to these factors kc values are impacted by site specific surface wetness conditions of a given field and therefore would be relatively less transferrable and would also be subject to change in different precipitation regimes either at different locations or in a different year in the same location which is not ideal hence the influence of precipitation needs to be minimized to obtain kc values that are fairly independent of precipitation variations and soil surface moisture conditions to accomplish this we quantified basal crop coefficients kcb and adjusted them for soil surface wetness when the normal kcr and kco values were adjusted to obtain basal crop coefficients kcbr and kcbo the fluctuations in kc values which arose from soil evaporation from precipitation were minimized figs 10 and 11 present alfalfa reference kcbr and grass reference kcbo basal crop coefficient curves developed by fitting third and fourth order polynomial regression functions to the time distribution dae fig 10 and thermal unit distribution ctu fig 11 of the measured kcbr and kcbo data the kcbr and kcbo data exhibited similar distribution and seasonal patterns to that found in kcr and kco with lower short term variability which is supported by the significant increase observed in r2 values in kcb functions from that observed in kc functions overall r2 of the kcb functions was 13 higher than that of kc functions when dae base scale was used and 16 higher for the former than the latter when ctu base scale was used this improvement in correlation was as high as 42 for crop specific sorghum models of kcb vs ctu we also developed resources to aid in application of these crop specific kc values measured under optimal growth conditions to be used for accurate estimation of eta in sites with similar conditions in order to achieve this we present functions that estimate kc both single and basal using a more convenient and transferrable scale than both dae and ctu this scale is normalized ctu nctu which is basically the ratio of ctu on a given day since emergence to ctu at harvest and has been successfully used previously to model crop growth colaizzi et al 2017 kukal and irmak 2019b this nctu scale ranges from 0 to 1 and allows for a common base scale across crops and growing seasons moreover the use of nctu improves the transferability of these functions because of its non dependency on absolute ctu values which can vary across locations and years the user can simply convert the ctu observed at the site for a given year to a 0 1 scale following the procedure outlined here and estimate kc and kcb using functions presented here table a2 these functions for kco kcb kcbo kcbr are also visually depicted in fig 12 for inter comparison of sub seasonal patterns across various crops functions representing relationships of kco kcr kcbo and kcbr vs dae and ctu are also presented table a2 the choice for the function to be used for a particular application depends on the relative level of underlying base scale data availability at a given site e g dae requires emergence records ctu or nctu 3 5 crop coefficient and leaf morphology in this section we aimed to determine how the ability of a plant to transpire under given evaporative demand conditions represented by crop coefficient is dictated by its morphological characteristics we attempted to empirically relate kcb quantified for several intervals in the growing season to leaf area index lai averaged for the intervals kcb was selected due to its effectiveness in representing the relative magnitude of eta to etref with minimized if not zero contribution from soil evaporation and thus better reflects crop water use dynamics and is fit to be investigated for its relationship with lai kukal and irmak 2019b used quantitative models to describe morphological growth for the four row crops in the same experiment fig 13 a and 13b present grass and alfalfa reference kcb regressed with lai respectively for each crop we find that there was a linear relationship for all crops signifying that the crops show higher rates of eta per unit for etref as the morphological area lai increases lai explained at least 7 13 for kcbr variability in kcbo to as high as 55 54 in kcbr the rates of increase in kcbo per unit increase in lai varied from 0 05 in l s maize 0 05 for kcbr to 0 16 in s s maize 0 14 for kcbr the rate of increase was the sharpest in s s maize due to relatively lower maximum lai possible in s s maize than other crops which leads to higher rates of carbon assimilation per unit leaf area and hence higher rates of water use or kcb 3 6 crop water productivity crop water productivity wp was reported on two different basis aboveground biomass agb based wp wpagb and grain yield gy based wp wpgy agb and cumulative eta showed high correlation 0 86 for each crop and the slope of the relationship fig 14 a represents the seasonal wpagb estimate for a given crop wpagb was the highest for l s maize 9 22 kg m 3 followed by sorghum 7 39 kg m 3 s s maize 7 05 kg m 3 winter wheat 4 37 kg m 3 and soybean 3 55 kg m 3 wpgy across different crops also followed the same order of relative magnitudes as wpagb fig 14b and c wpgy was greater than wpagb by 339 267 274 228 and 422 for s s maize l s maize soybean sorghum and winter wheat respectively we estimated the relationship between the ratio of wpgy to wpagb and harvest index the proportion of gy to agb at harvest the harvest index hi varied from 0 25 in winter wheat to 0 38 in sorghum table 1 wpgy wpagb were strongly and positively correlated r2 0 98 and it was found that across all crops the ratio increased by 8 with every 10 increase in hi conventionally wpgy is the variable of interest when food production with respect to water use is to be considered however wpagb presents insights into two main economic and environmental aspects of agricultural production firstly crops such as maize both s s and l s maize and sorghum are also bioenergy crops and hence wpagb is of greater interest than wpgy in their production secondly agb is an effective indicator of sequestered carbon in terrestrial ecosystems and hence effective measurement of wpagb is prerequisite to evaluation of water use given unit carbon sequestered so that large scale assessments can be conducted 3 7 impact of vapor pressure deficit on wpagb vapor pressure deficit vpd integrates the effect of air temperature and relative humidity and hence is a robust indicator of the environmental regime for crop growth at a given site in this research the measurements of agb and eta were conducted at weekly to biweekly frequency over the growing season among these discrete periods of sampling environmental conditions represented here using vpd varied widely as is the case for all annual crops at a given site this is evident from fig 15 a which presents the vpd measured at the site during each of the sampling periods for wpagb measurement for all crops during both growing seasons for the summer crops the vpd increased initially in the growing season to a maximum value 1 75 kpa and then started decreasing until physiological maturity 0 5 0 6 kpa with substantial variability for winter wheat vpd decreased from around 0 5 to a minimal value 0 05 during pre dormant and dormant periods and thereon increased during post dormant period variability in vpd impacts crop water use and hence can govern the wpagb demonstrated by the crop to demonstrate the importance of vpd in this regard first we quantified the sensitivity of carbon agb assimilation to water use eta using measured data in this research we calculated independent estimates of gain in agb and eta required to achieve that gain during every sampling period these independent estimates were linearly regressed to obtain estimates of the slope the curves in the left column of fig 15b show the parameters of the linear regressions and it was found that variability in eta during the growing season was able to explain anywhere from 1 to 16 of the variability in agb gain the lack of a high correlation among these quantities is because of three primary reasons i inherent differences in carbon uptake during different crop physiological stages ii use of eta instead of t transpiration which does not reflect true crop water use and iii variability in environmental conditions i e differences in weather conditions during growing season length due to differences in planting emergence growth and harvest between the crops across growth periods leading to confounding estimates of the sensitivity of dry matter accumulation to crop water use quantification of this sensitivity was largely improved when eta was normalized using vpd for the sampling period and the resulting eta vpd ratio parameter is used to regress against agb this concept has been employed in previous research bierhuizen and slatyer 1965 tanner 1981 1983 kemanian et al 2005 that aimed at quantification of the slope of the regression between cumulative agb and t normalized using vpd however our use of this approach differs in two aspects i use of eta instead of t and ii use of independent values of agb and eta rather than cumulative values although eta is not the real representation of crop water use due to inclusion of non beneficial component of evaporation it is easier to estimate or measure eta than transpiration in the field conditions and hence quantifying the sensitivity or slope of agb to eta vpd has value albeit the low correlation owing to the use of eta the use of vpd normalized eta resulted in 550 1800 125 and 140 improvement in the correlation magnitude in s s maize l s maize soybean and sorghum respectively while no improvement was found for winter wheat also for all crops except winter wheat the slope or sensitivity increased when eta vpd was used instead of eta the slopes from the agb vs eta vpd relationships right column in fig 15b can also be interpreted as a more sophisticated assessment of wpagb due to the use of independent estimates of the quantities regressed as opposed to use of cumulative values which is subject to propagation of bias stemming from sampling errors this approach is also supported by mathematical proofs malet et al 1997 that reveal that slopes derived from cumulated variables in bio environmental relationships are statistical artifacts however these potential sources of misinterpretation are often overlooked especially while quantifying wp our analyses demonstrate the value and importance of i using independent values of agb and eta and ii accounting for vpd variation in estimating wpagb the sensitivity was found to be the highest for l s maize and sorghum 4 75 and 4 74 g m 2 mm 1 kpa followed by s s maize 4 55 g m 2 mm 1 kpa soybean 2 72 g m 2 mm 1 kpa and winter wheat 2 23 g m 2 mm 1 kpa these slopes presented in comparison to each other in fig 15c bring out the difference in carbon assimilation per unit of water use among c3 soybean and winter wheat and c4 maize and sorghum crops in general the two c4 crops were 89 more water efficient than the two c3 crops and while this behavior is documented in the literature pearcy and ehleringer 1984 pearcy and calkin 1983 we quantify these differences for irrigated row cereal crops grown under optimal conditions 4 conclusions this research measured important water flux and crop growth and productivity variables for four row crops maize soybean sorghum and winter wheat in south central nebraska during two growing seasons and employed them to quantify important dynamics such as soil water crop water use crop water use vs evaporative demand crop water use vs heat accumulation and crop productivity vs water use relationships total soil water and soil water depletion were quantified on a daily basis throughout the growing seasons of each crop winter wheat had the maximum total seasonal depletion mean of 546 mm during 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 followed by l s maize 394 mm soybean 243 mm sorghum 236 mm and s s maize 222 mm the contribution of each soil layer to total soil water depletion was also quantified and crop specific patterns were studied the highest season total eta was demonstrated by winter wheat 604 mm followed by l s maize 594 mm soybean 591 mm s s maize 547 mm and sorghum 518 mm the sub seasonal and seasonal total eta were also normalized and scaled by a measure of heat accumulation cumulative thermal units and it was found that s s maize showed the maximum season total eta 600 mm followed by soybean 553 mm l s maize 534 mm sorghum 484 mm and winter wheat 363 mm when eta was scaled to 1500 c quantitative relationships among eta rates in various crops were developed for a given magnitude of evaporative demand moreover it was demonstrated that the two step eta estimation method fao 56 was subject to considerable errors which necessitates the development of local single kc and basal kcb values for each crop to aid in accurate estimation of eta in similar conditions empirical functions were developed for alfalfa and grass reference kc and kcb with three base scales of varying sophistication dae ctu and nctu sensitivity of crops to evapotranspire given unit of water to morphological area lai was quantified and functions were presented wpgy and wpagb were calculated for each crop and it was found that l s maize had the highest wp followed by sorghum s s maize winter wheat and soybean finally the importance of vpd to explain the variability and improve prediction of wpagb was studied and experimental evidence presented to establish that the two c4 crops maize and sorghum were 89 more water efficient than the two c3 crops soybean and winter wheat this research establishes a benchmark given the challenges encountered in order to maintain consistent conditions across four crop species so as to justify fair comparisons of crop water use and productivity in semi arid conditions of nebraska efforts to achieve this comparative assessment included maintaining consistent soil and crop management practices intervals of water use and crop productivity sampling use of subsurface drip irrigation to minimize surface soil evaporation losses etc to the best of our knowledge this research is the first to conduct comparative water use and productivity dynamics in four major c3 and c4 cropping systems in nebraska and among the first ones in the u s high plains the data and information presented in this manuscript would aid in informed crop selection by producers in light of water use and productivity both for grain yield and biomass metrics across these crops as well as provide them with irrigation management tools crop coefficients to be managed

10823,soil moisture plays a key role in vegetation restoration and ecosystem stability terracing modulates hydrological processes by lowering the slope gradient and shortening the slope length the response of soil moisture variation to terracing is strongly influenced by land use climate topography and terracing characteristics in this study we conducted a meta analysis to examine the response of soil moisture to terracing in china for china s landscapes terracing generally improved the soil moisture by 12 9 relative to other terracing structures level ditches showed the greatest water conservation benefits especially on steep slopes terracing had higher water storage benefits in the northern plains and the southern dry hot valleys of china the benefits of water storage by terracing rose with increasing slope gradients above 15 and fell with increasing depth of soil layers soil moisture in the 0 100 cm depth differed among terracing structures but not among land uses mainly due to the differences in evapotranspiration under different micro topographical conditions in contrast soil moisture at the depth of 100 200 cm differed among land use types but not among terracing structures only because root water uptake always differed across land use types regarding climatic factors precipitation played a dominant role in soil moisture variation keywords soil moisture

ensure a sufficient food supply for the growing world population reduction in soil moisture due to runoff is a serious problem for sloping lands in different regions of china chen et al 2018 hofmeister et al 2016 and reconfiguration of hillside fields into terraces is one of the most important techniques used to enhance runoff reduction efficiency and benefit soil water conservation in those mountainous regions schuh et al 2017 xu et al 2016 rashid et al 2016 terracing alters surface soil conditions and enhance crop growth due to prevented runoff and soil water and heat energy can thus be better utilized terracing also increases the efficiency of soil moisture and nutrient usage damene et al 2012 wolka et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 which enhances crop resistance to droughts and diseases successfully and ultimately improves crop yields gebremedhin et al 1999 chowdhury et al 2001 kosmowski 2018 accordingly terracing not only changes the landscape but also improves the local

dynamics are closely related to infiltration evaporation water uptake by roots and runoff regulators which further increases the dynamics of terracing soil moisture relations yang et al 2014a b zhang et al 2017 in the loess hilly and gully region of china for example liu et al 2011 found that terracing remarkable increases soil moisture storage in the 40 180 cm therefore crops in terraced land can absorb more water than those in sloping land however some conclusions are inconsistent as zhang et al 2009 indicated that sloped land showed a higher degree of compensation for soil water storage deficit than did terraced land in the 0 200 cm soil profile in the red soil area ouyang et al 2014 discovered that soil water content of a dry terrace land 37 54 was lower than that of a slope field 45 40 furthermore natural rainfall infiltration was enhanced after the construction of level terraces and level ditches in the dry and hot valley of yunnan converting 89 and 83 of rainfall into soil moisture respectively with only 22 of rainfall being converted into soil moisture on natural slopes as stressed characterization of the soil moisture of terracing is fundamental for both theoretical and practical applications andrea et al 2015 camera et al 2012 chen et al 2016 wei et al 2016 although a clear conclusion has been drawn that terracing can affect soil moisture dynamics large differences in the effectiveness of terracing on soil water conservation across different regions remain in addition diverse approaches have been used to evaluate the effects of terracing on soil moisture and site or plot scale investigations of terracing are especially numerous the results of such small scale studies however are always conflicting consequently a systematic understanding of terracing effects on soil moisture variation is extremely important and necessary for appropriate strategies regarding terrace construction and maintenance in this study therefore the responses of soil moisture variation to terracing at the national scale in china were mainly analyzed meta analysis approach was used to investigate 1 differences in the response of soil moisture to terracing among diverse terracing structures climatic zones land uses soil depths and slope gradients and 2 to which extent that soil moisture is altered by different terracing measures in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 data sources and compilation we searched for peer reviewed journal articles using the isi web of science google scholar and chinese journals database cnki with no restriction regarding the years of publication the following sets of topic keywords were used terracing or terraces and soil moisture or soil water and china totally over 200 articles dating to 1980 that were related to the effects of terracing on soil moisture variation in china were obtained to evaluate the changes in soil moisture more objectively we selected these documented articles using four criteria 1 the terraced and related control treatments were conducted in similar experimental fields 2 the terraced and control plots were established in the same ecosystem types the same dominant plant species and the same soil types 3 the terracing structures of the study sites were clearly recorded and the measured variables in both controlled and terraced groups were performed at the same spatiotemporal scales and 4 to avoid short term fluctuations experimental measurements for less than one growing season were excluded after this exhaustive literature searching a total of 84 articles representing 1741 observations were included in our database fig 1 data subjected to a standardization process were allowed for comparisons when data were presented in only graphical form we digitized them using the software plot digitizer ver 2 6 2 for extraction cayuela et al 2014 meta analysis has been developed previously for the quantitative integration from individual studies and this approach is increasingly being used in those studies of soil moisture recharge and water use efficiency zhang et al 2018 sirimarco et al 2018 carrijo et al 2017 xu et al 2013 2 2 data analysis for further data compiling prior to the meta analysis we categorized terraces into six types including level terraces reversed slope terraces slope separated terraces sloped terraces level ditches and fish scale pit terraces slope gradients were grouped into three classes steep slopes 25 moderate slopes 10 25 and gentle slopes 10 due to the inconsistent reporting of slope gradients in the literature terrace ages were classified into five groups 1 2 years 3 5 years 6 10 years 11 30 years and over 30 years the geographical positions were grouped into four groups according to the average annual precipitation arid 250 mm semi arid 250 400 mm semi humid 400 800 mm and humid 800 mm regions meta analysis was used to generate confidence intervals to compare the differences in soil moisture between each categorical variable we performed an unweighted analysis using the response ratio to calculate bootstrapped confidence limits to include those studies that did not adequately report sample size or standard deviation using the statistical software metawin 2 0 rosenberg et al 2000 the overall effect size was calculated using a categorical random effects model the effect size r employed in this study is the magnitude of the soil moisture content of the terraced mean xt relative to the sloped mean xs r 1 xt xs where xt is the soil moisture content in terraced land and xs is the soil moisture content in the corresponding sloping land the y axis is an invalid line and it represents an effect size of zero when the confidence interval crossed the invalid line including 0 the efficiency is not significant the difference was considered significant if the confidence intervals did not overlap each other a statistical significance level of p 0 05 was used in this study 3 result 3 1 effects of terracing structures on soil moisture after long term cultivation experience chinese ancestors have created and constructed diverse terraces of different structures according to the natural slope features fig 2 level terrace is the most common type of terraces in china s territories and this is due to the specific geological conditions and cropping systems in general soil moisture content in the terraced lands increased significantly by an average of 12 4 relative to that in sloping lands in china according to the database six types of terracing structures were identified level bench reverse slope slope separated sloped level ditch and half moon also called fish scale pits terraces fig 2 soil water storage of such terraces are considered effective when the effect size r 0 and all the six types of terracing structures in our study were confirmed effective in soil water storage with level ditches having the greatest benefit 34 9 followed by reverse slope terraces 22 9 slope separated terraces 17 8 and level terraces 16 1 slope terraces and fish scale pits had the lowest benefits at 11 6 and 8 9 respectively significant differences in water storage efficiency p 0 05 among these six types of terracing structures were also observed fig 3 3 2 effects of climatic zone location of terracing on soil moisture to evaluate the effect of climatic zone variations of terracing on soil water content we classified the dataset into three regions semi arid semi humid and humid based on the mean annual precipitation map those regions with map 800 mm were classified as humid regions regions with 400 mm map 800 mm were classified as semi humid regions and regions with 250 mm map 400 mm were classified as semi arid regions arid regions were not considered in our study due to a lack of available data caused by less observations on terracing with regard to the distribution of precipitation the benefit of water conservation after terracing was 28 6 higher for semi humid areas the benefits of terracing in semi arid areas and humid areas were 15 1 and 5 4 respectively the effect sizes for all different map classes differed significantly p 0 05 fig 4 a the dataset was divided into four groups 5 c 5 10 c 10 15 c and 15 c according to the mean annual temperature mat in the different terraced regions terracing was found to improve soil water content markedly across all four mat subgroups and terracing efficiency was the highest in regions with an mat 15 43 3 followed by terraced regions with an mat 5 23 7 10 15 21 8 and 5 10 13 3 respectively fig 4b one way anova approach revealed significant variations in soil moisture p 0 05 after terracing among the four mat subgroups the result of variance analysis showed that map and mat explained 90 and 10 of the soil moisture variations respectively 3 3 effects of land use in terraced sites on soil moisture the beneficial impact of terracing on water conservation varied with different land uses we classified the dataset into five groups bare land cropland grassland forestland and tree cropland a significant increase in soil water content was detected for terraces with all 5 types of land uses the largest improvement in soil moisture was observed in grassland with an increase of 28 2 followed by tree cropland with an increase of 25 9 bare land cropland and forestland presented relatively lower efficiency in terms of soil water with values of 14 4 14 0 and 12 3 respectively fig 5 for regions with mats of 0 5 and 5 10 grassland presented the greatest beneficial impact on water conservation with values of 50 and 88 respectively in those regions with a mat of 10 15 soil water increased mostly in terraced tree cropland followed by terraced bare land and terraced cropland in the regions of 15 20 the greatest increase in soil moisture was in the grassland with an increase of 34 5 followed by forestland with an increase of 20 0 fig 6 a for humid regions forest terraced land demonstrated the highest efficiency in semi arid regions grassland showed the greatest benefits followed by bare land tree cropland and cropland finally forestland presented the lowest efficiency overall additionally the beneficial effect of tree crops on soil water conservation was highest in semi humid regions fig 6b 3 4 effects of soil layer depth of terraces on soil moisture terracing can significantly promote soil water storage across different soil depths between 0 and 200 cm fig 7 the surface soil layer i e 0 20 cm showed the highest water storage benefit of 26 1 and the benefit always remained greater than 20 across the 0 100 cm depth though it declined significantly below 100 cm furthermore the water storage benefit of terracing at a depth of 100 200 cm was between 10 and 12 fig 7 soil moisture at different depths varied highly with terracing structures and land use types firstly terracing structures can greatly affect water conservation under different soil layers for example the water storage of level terraces in the 0 120 cm soil layer was between 20 and 30 and varied between 10 and 20 in the 120 200 cm soil layer the surface layer 0 20 cm in the reverse slope terraces exhibited a lower water storage benefit and the water storage benefit was higher than 30 at the soil depths of 40 120 cm in contrast the slope separated terraces showed the greatest water storage benefit at the 0 20 cm soil depth layer the efficiency of level ditches was greater than 20 in both shallow and deep soils the surface soil layer 0 20 cm of fish scale pits showed a water storage efficiency of 23 5 whereas the other layers had values less than 20 fig 8 secondly the water conservation benefits of different land use types were also analyzed it was found that a soil depth of 0 80 cm in cropland presented a relatively high benefit of approximately 20 and the benefit at depths below 80 cm was less than 20 the grassland showed a higher water storage benefit in the entire soil layer especially at depths of 0 40 cm and the water storage benefit was greater than 50 the benefit of water storage in the forest was generally lower except for the 40 60 cm layer which had a considerable benefit of 48 7 conversely depth of both 140 160 cm and 180 200 cm showed negative water storage benefits fig 9 3 5 slope gradient effects on soil moisture under different soil depths the effectiveness of terracing on water storage benefit was also affected by the slope gradient in general terraces on different slopes show positive water storage benefits nonetheless the water storage benefit of terraces below 15 was not significant as the 95 confidence interval encompassed 0 with a benefit of approximately 5 the benefit of water storage by terracing was enhanced with an increasing slope gradient above 15 fig 10 on gentle slopes lower than 10 level terraces showed the highest water storage efficiency of 6 2 followed by slope separated terraces 4 0 and slope terraces 3 7 on moderate slopes 10 20 reverse slope terraces and level ditches had higher water storage benefits of 34 6 and 30 4 respectively on steep slopes 20 level ditches and fish scale pits showed greater water storage benefits of 23 1 and 19 1 respectively fig 11 a the bare land and cropland showed an approximately equivalent water storage benefit on gentle slopes below 10 on moderate slopes the water storage benefit of grassland was greatest at 30 5 followed by forestland 13 0 and tree cropland 9 6 on steep slopes 20 the water storage in grassland had the highest benefit of 30 followed by cropland of 20 9 and tree cropland of 11 3 respectively fig 11b 4 discussion 4 1 relationships between terracing structures and soil moisture terracing has been shown to be an effective method of soil and water conservation on slopes and has been widely adopted chen et al 2017 nyssen et al 2009 strehmel et al 2016 wei et al 2019 terracing changes the slope surface to a horizontal plane and the flow lines of the slope flow and the middle stream are continuously cut off thereby eliminating the redistribution of precipitation on the hill slopes rainfall is intercepted such that it can be infiltrated on the spot without causing runoff and sediment flow xu et al 2018 hu et al 2007 this feature is especially obvious in level ditches in china in which an average of 89 of the rainfall infiltrates into soil in the loess plateau for example hu et al 2007 discovered that the effects of level ditches and reforestation on water conservation were better than those of other terracing structures under the same site conditions the average soil water content of underground soil in level ditches was 11 32 which was 9 higher than that of reverse slope terraces 28 6 higher than that of fish scale pits and 46 higher than that of sloped lands respectively this is mainly because rainfall redistribution was directly intercepted on hill slopes and changes in micro topography has reduced runoff loss and thus increased soil water content according to the meta analysis level ditches showed the highest efficiency in terms of soil water storage while level ditches have often been constructed on steep slopes and can intercept most of the surface runoff infiltrate it into soil and redistribute rainfall in time and space fig 3 in addition reverse slope terraces and slope separated terraces can absorb rainfall enhance infiltration and reduce the loss of soil moisture in the lateral ridges fig 2 wang et al 2004 illustrated that reverse slope terraces can create micro catchments and thus enhance rainwater collection the enhancement on the other hand is negatively related to the horizontal distance of the slope and positively related to the horizontal width of platform field slope separated terraces are usually built in semi arid areas and 1 3 of the slope length is cultivated into a horizontal platform backfilled with topsoil and fertilizer is added to promote soil ripening liang et al 2011 the length of the slope section is generally 3 8 m and slope sections can collect runoff and increase soil moisture on the surface of platform sections this type of slope separated terrace is suitable for planting high yield crops on the platforms e g corn and wheat and economic forests on slopes liang et al 2011 zhang and wu 2012 in general the construction mode and utilization of slope separated terraces are based on topography and local land resources however some studies also captured that the specific structures of level terraces and fish scale pits may have the potential to increase soil air contacting area and finally intensify inefficient evaporation li et al 2014 which need to take mulching measures in practice to reduce such risks 4 2 relationships between climatic location of terracing and soil moisture soil moisture is recharged and regulated by precipitation and temperature wang et al 2018 and the precipitation gradient factor affects soil moisture by regulating soil hydrological processes yang et al 2018 c wang et al 2017 t j wang et al 2017 the semi arid regions of china such as the loess plateau frequently face serious water scarcity issues in this case terracing can improve rainfall infiltration which promotes vegetation restoration and increases soil water evaporation for low precipitation zones even a small increase in soil moisture by terracing is valuable in contrast the efficiency of terracing on water storage is weakest in humid regions fig 4a because soil moisture is no longer the restricted factor for plants and terraces are mainly used for enlarging cultivated paddy areas as well as for flood control in such regions for example c wang et al 2017 t j wang et al 2017 reported a significant linear correlation between soil moisture and map with soil moisture in the grassland more affected by precipitation than that of other land use types soil moisture is depleted over days and weeks primarily by plant uptake transpiration and soil evaporation zhang et al 2017 soil evaporation occurs in shallow layers with lower root density and varies temporally based on available solar energy as reflected by soil temperatures lag behind solar radiation inputs loik et al 2004 therefore temperature can be considered a key factor leading to soil water loss under those conditions of high soil moisture contents in regions with mat 15 c e g yuanmou county in yunnan province the benefit of water conservation is greatest of 43 2 this region is covered by dry and hot valleys with strong evaporation induced by warm temperatures centralized rainfall can induce severe erosion in the summer and severe water shortage in dry seasons fortunately terracing can reduce water erosion alleviate the uneven distribution of soil moisture over seasons and promote vegetation restoration in northeastern china with mat 5 c terracing consequently increased soil water storage when coupled with low water evaporation and low temperatures 4 3 relationships between land use and soil moisture in terraces land use strategies can influence the conservation and efficiency of stored water choudhury 2015 gao et al 2014 zucco et al 2014 in this study grassland terraces presented the highest efficiency of soil water storage and forestland terraces showed the lowest efficiency fig 5 soil moisture influenced by terracing between different land uses has been compared in many catchments of china which have indicated that soil moisture in bare soils is usually higher than that in vegetated soils furthermore soil moisture in annual crops and grasses is higher than that in forests wang et al 2013 li et al 2018 returning farmland to grassland is regarded as one of the best methods for improving soil water retention and reducing soil evaporation in semi arid regions yu et al 2015 li et al 2017 for tree crops the amount of water loss was smaller than that in cropland and bare land which resulted from interception during the water budget balance yu et al 2018 concluded that soil moisture in terraced forestland was lower than that in native grassland and farmland at all spatial domains during both wet and dry periods additionally li et al 2018 indicated that an increase in forest cover significantly reduces soil moisture but that precipitation is suppressed by the weakened summer monsoon in southwestern china in general root water uptake is an important process that controls soil moisture dynamics yang et al 2014a b forestland terraces are mainly covered by introduced vegetation unlike native plants the introduced plant species usually have deep root systems that reach far below precipitation infiltration depths and might consume deeper soil moisture chen et al 2010 yang et al 2014a b for example the root system of maize soybean and stipa bungeana in farmland may be mainly distributed in the 0 100 cm wang et al 2011 while the roots of c korshinskii could extend to 640 cm wang et al 2010 excessive depletion of soil water by a deep root system without sufficient rainwater infiltration can result in a lower level of deep soil moisture in woodlands and shrublands yang et al 2014a b in addition the amount of infiltration is distinct among land use types because of distinct crown interception such as lower infiltration in forests rather than that in grassland yu et al 2015 both precipitation and land use affect the source and consumption of soil moisture which further affect soil moisture variability 4 4 relationships between soil depth and soil moisture in terraces in our research the water storage efficiency of terracing was higher in the soil layers of 0 100 cm fig 7 indeed the water storage benefits of different soil layers in different terraces differed significantly with reverse slope terraces presenting a higher water storage benefit at the soil depth of 40 120 cm and level ditches showing greater efficiency across all soil layers fig 8 chen et al 2008 concluded that water rarely reaches soil below 200 cm in drylands under both natural and simulated rainfall conditions li 2001 explored how soil infiltration impacted by rainfall events might reach 100 300 cm with an average of 200 cm and liu et al 2010 found that shrubs were more sensitive to annual rainfall variation than grasses the characteristics of soil moisture variation suggested that precipitation replenishment is limited for deep layers in terraced fields february and higgins 2010 reported that soil moisture in forestland is mainly affected by plant root systems resulting in a drier zone than upper layers which may explain the relatively lower soil moisture at deeper layers similar results have been reported by others for example weltzin and mcpherson 1997 found that mature trees mainly absorb water from deeper soils than grasses in savannas soil moisture is highly affected by precipitation and micro topography in surface layer whereas mainly influenced by plant roots in deep layers in our study grassland and tree crops presented higher efficiency in deep soil layers fig 9 which reveals that water more easily travels vertically in artificial grasses and tree crops and the amount of infiltration is greater than that of water loss during this process 4 5 relationships between slope gradient and soil moisture in terraces the influence of slope angle on soil moisture distribution has been examined in many studies yang et al 2012 yang et al 2015 lv et al 2013 knowledge of soil water storage by terracing along the slope gradient is necessary to improve land management and to guide restoration practices in terraced fields according to our study terraces present a higher efficiency on steep slopes specifically level terraces and sloped terraces presented greater efficiency on gentle slopes whereas level ditches and fish scale pits showed greater efficiency on steep slopes in the hilly and gully region of northern shaanxi for example bai et al 1998 discovered that when there is a lack of investment it is advisable to adopt level ditches and fish scale pits on slopes of 15 25 the influence of slope gradient on soil water dynamics has two aspects 1 with an increase in slope the soil infiltration rate will decrease which can increase the amount of runoff 2 the effective rainfall captured by the soil will decrease as the slope increases mu et al 2015 indicated that the descending trend of the soil infiltration rate curve increased with increasing rainfall intensity and slope gradient indeed the increased slope resulted in a decrease in the soil infiltration rate that led to an increase in runoff fox et al 1997 also conducted an experiment to study the influence of slope angle on final infiltration rate for inter rill conditions and noted that changes in overland flow depth and surface storage were the main reasons for the dominant influence of the slope angle on the infiltration rate 5 concluding remarks in this meta analysis we identified how terracing affect soil moisture variation under different environmental variables in china a topic that has not been previously investigated the results indicated that terracing has improved soil moisture content by 12 4 on average in china the responses of soil moisture to terracing vary from different terracing structures climatic e g precipitation and temperature zones land uses soil depths and slope gradients level ditches presented the greatest water conservation benefit relative to other terracing structures higher efficiency of terracing on improving soil water was observed in the regions with a semi humid climate and mat in the range of 5 15 grassland terraces presented greater efficiency in semi arid areas with cold climates whereas forest terraces showed higher efficiency in humid and warmer climates level terraces and sloped terraces presented higher efficiency on gentle slopes but level ditches and fish scale pits showed greater efficiency on steep slopes other variables e g terrace age size and management which possibly influence the effectiveness of terraces on soil moisture in china were not considered due to insufficient data our results can provide important implications for terrace construction management and ecosystem services under different environments terraces are considered typical examples of coupled human and nature ecosystems currently terraces are particularly threatened by a lack of financial support and an aging farming population which induce poor conservation and weak maintenance of terraces the effectiveness of terraces however depends on proper construction and regular maintenance due to the increasing challenges of abandonment and collapsing risks the central and local governments should formulate effective measures to preserve terraces by providing financial incentives to farmers to maintain terraced landscapes regularly only through this path the sustainable development of terrace ecosystems can be achieved which finally benefit the natural ecosystems and enhancing human well being acknowledgments this work was supported by the national key r

10823,soil moisture plays a key role in vegetation restoration and ecosystem stability terracing modulates hydrological processes by lowering the slope gradient and shortening the slope length the response of soil moisture variation to terracing is strongly influenced by land use climate topography and terracing characteristics in this study we conducted a meta analysis to examine the response of soil moisture to terracing in china for china s landscapes terracing generally improved the soil moisture by 12 9 relative to other terracing structures level ditches showed the greatest water conservation benefits especially on steep slopes terracing had higher water storage benefits in the northern plains and the southern dry hot valleys of china the benefits of water storage by terracing rose with increasing slope gradients above 15 and fell with increasing depth of soil layers soil moisture in the 0 100 cm depth differed among terracing structures but not among land uses mainly due to the differences in evapotranspiration under different micro topographical conditions in contrast soil moisture at the depth of 100 200 cm differed among land use types but not among terracing structures only because root water uptake always differed across land use types regarding climatic factors precipitation played a dominant role in soil moisture variation keywords soil moisture terracing climate change meta analysis china 1 introduction soil moisture plays a key role in determining ecosystem structures and functions by affecting a series of biophysical and biogeochemical processes such as carbon water nitrogen cycle plant phenology forest growth vegetation distribution and microbial activity in terms of decomposition maxwell et al 2018 fang et al 2018 shi et al 2018 ma et al 2018 jin et al 2018 elmendorf et al 2012 soil moisture always changes substantially with rising temperatures and has received increasing interests in recent years dermody et al 2007 selyutin 2016 mihailovic et al 2016 c wang et al 2017 t j wang et al 2017 hawkes et al 2017 d odorico and porporato 2004 which is the most important factor that limits sustainable agricultural production to ensure a sufficient food supply for the growing world population reduction in soil moisture due to runoff is a serious problem for sloping lands in different regions of china chen et al 2018 hofmeister et al 2016 and reconfiguration of hillside fields into terraces is one of the most important techniques used to enhance runoff reduction efficiency and benefit soil water conservation in those mountainous regions schuh et al 2017 xu et al 2016 rashid et al 2016 terracing alters surface soil conditions and enhance crop growth due to prevented runoff and soil water and heat energy can thus be better utilized terracing also increases the efficiency of soil moisture and nutrient usage damene et al 2012 wolka et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 which enhances crop resistance to droughts and diseases successfully and ultimately improves crop yields gebremedhin et al 1999 chowdhury et al 2001 kosmowski 2018 accordingly terracing not only changes the landscape but also improves the local agricultural environment and land carrying capacity scientists have studied the variability of soil water in different ecosystems on terraced and slope lands rashid et al 2016 liu et al 2016 wei et al 2015 when considering the influencing factors e g soil properties land cover micro landform vegetation and meteorological environments the response of soil moisture to terracing is highly variable

dynamics are closely related to infiltration evaporation water uptake by roots and runoff regulators which further increases the dynamics of terracing soil moisture relations yang et al 2014a b zhang et al 2017 in the loess hilly and gully region of china for example liu et al 2011 found that terracing remarkable increases soil moisture storage in the 40 180 cm therefore crops in terraced land can absorb more water than those in sloping land however some conclusions are inconsistent as zhang et al 2009 indicated that sloped land showed a higher degree of compensation for soil water storage deficit than did terraced land in the 0 200 cm soil profile in the red soil area ouyang et al 2014 discovered that soil water content of a dry terrace land 37 54 was lower than that of a slope field 45 40 furthermore natural rainfall infiltration was enhanced after the construction of level terraces and level ditches in the dry and hot valley of yunnan converting 89 and 83 of rainfall into soil moisture respectively with only 22 of rainfall being converted into soil moisture on natural slopes as stressed characterization of the soil moisture of terracing is fundamental for both theoretical and practical applications andrea et al 2015 camera et al 2012 chen et al 2016 wei et al 2016 although a clear conclusion has been drawn that terracing can affect soil moisture dynamics large differences in the effectiveness of terracing on soil water conservation across different regions remain in addition diverse approaches have been used to evaluate the effects of terracing on soil moisture and site or plot scale investigations of terracing are especially numerous the results of such small scale studies however are always conflicting consequently a systematic understanding of terracing effects on soil moisture variation is extremely important and necessary for appropriate strategies regarding terrace construction and maintenance in this study therefore the responses of soil moisture variation to terracing at the national scale in china were mainly analyzed meta analysis approach was used to investigate 1 differences in the response of soil moisture to terracing among diverse terracing structures climatic zones land uses soil depths and slope gradients and 2 to which extent that soil moisture is altered by different terracing measures in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 data sources and compilation we searched for peer reviewed journal articles using the isi web of science google scholar and chinese journals database cnki with no restriction regarding the years of publication the following sets of topic keywords were used terracing or terraces and soil moisture or soil water and china totally over 200 articles dating to 1980 that were related to the effects of terracing on soil moisture variation in china were obtained to evaluate the changes in soil moisture more objectively we selected these documented articles using four criteria 1 the terraced and related control treatments were conducted in similar experimental fields 2 the terraced and control plots were established in the same ecosystem types the same dominant plant species and the same soil types 3 the terracing structures of the study sites were clearly recorded and the measured variables in both controlled and terraced groups were performed at the same spatiotemporal scales and 4 to avoid short term fluctuations experimental measurements for less than one growing season were excluded after this exhaustive literature searching a total of 84 articles representing 1741 observations were included in our database fig 1 data subjected to a standardization process were allowed for comparisons when data were presented in only graphical form we digitized them using the software plot digitizer ver 2 6 2 for extraction cayuela et al 2014 meta analysis has been developed previously for the quantitative integration from individual studies and this approach is increasingly being used in those studies of soil moisture recharge and water use efficiency zhang et al 2018 sirimarco et al 2018 carrijo et al 2017 xu et al 2013 2 2 data analysis for further data compiling prior to the meta analysis we categorized terraces into six types including level terraces reversed slope terraces slope separated terraces sloped terraces level ditches and fish scale pit terraces slope gradients were grouped into three classes steep slopes 25 moderate slopes 10 25 and gentle slopes 10 due to the inconsistent reporting of slope gradients in the literature terrace ages were classified into five groups 1 2 years 3 5 years 6 10 years 11 30 years and over 30 years the geographical positions were grouped into four groups according to the average annual precipitation arid 250 mm semi arid 250 400 mm semi humid 400 800 mm and humid 800 mm regions meta analysis was used to generate confidence intervals to compare the differences in soil moisture between each categorical variable we performed an unweighted analysis using the response ratio to calculate bootstrapped confidence limits to include those studies that did not adequately report sample size or standard deviation using the statistical software metawin 2 0 rosenberg et al 2000 the overall effect size was calculated using a categorical random effects model the effect size r employed in this study is the magnitude of the soil moisture content of the terraced mean xt relative to the sloped mean xs r 1 xt xs where xt is the soil moisture content in terraced land and xs is the soil moisture content in the corresponding sloping land the y axis is an invalid line and it represents an effect size of zero when the confidence interval crossed the invalid line including 0 the efficiency is not significant the difference was considered significant if the confidence intervals did not overlap each other a statistical significance level of p 0 05 was used in this study 3 result 3 1 effects of terracing structures on soil moisture after long term cultivation experience chinese ancestors have created and constructed diverse terraces of different structures according to the natural slope features fig 2 level terrace is the most common type of terraces in china s territories and this is due to the specific geological conditions and cropping systems in general soil moisture content in the terraced lands increased significantly by an average of 12 4 relative to that in sloping lands in china according to the database six types of terracing structures were identified level bench reverse slope slope separated sloped level ditch and half moon also called fish scale pits terraces fig 2 soil water storage of such terraces are considered effective when the effect size r 0 and all the six types of terracing structures in our study were confirmed effective in soil water storage with level ditches having the greatest benefit 34 9 followed by reverse slope terraces 22 9 slope separated terraces 17 8 and level terraces 16 1 slope terraces and fish scale pits had the lowest benefits at 11 6 and 8 9 respectively significant differences in water storage efficiency p 0 05 among these six types of terracing structures were also observed fig 3 3 2 effects of climatic zone location of terracing on soil moisture to evaluate the effect of climatic zone variations of terracing on soil water content we classified the dataset into three regions semi arid semi humid and humid based on the mean annual precipitation map those regions with map 800 mm were classified as humid regions regions with 400 mm map 800 mm were classified as semi humid regions and regions with 250 mm map 400 mm were classified as semi arid regions arid regions were not considered in our study due to a lack of available data caused by less observations on terracing with regard to the distribution of precipitation the benefit of water conservation after terracing was 28 6 higher for semi humid areas the benefits of terracing in semi arid areas and humid areas were 15 1 and 5 4 respectively the effect sizes for all different map classes differed significantly p 0 05 fig 4 a the dataset was divided into four groups 5 c 5 10 c 10 15 c and 15 c according to the mean annual temperature mat in the different terraced regions terracing was found to improve soil water content markedly across all four mat subgroups and terracing efficiency was the highest in regions with an mat 15 43 3 followed by terraced regions with an mat 5 23 7 10 15 21 8 and 5 10 13 3 respectively fig 4b one way anova approach revealed significant variations in soil moisture p 0 05 after terracing among the four mat subgroups the result of variance analysis showed that map and mat explained 90 and 10 of the soil moisture variations respectively 3 3 effects of land use in terraced sites on soil moisture the beneficial impact of terracing on water conservation varied with different land uses we classified the dataset into five groups bare land cropland grassland forestland and tree cropland a significant increase in soil water content was detected for terraces with all 5 types of land uses the largest improvement in soil moisture was observed in grassland with an increase of 28 2 followed by tree cropland with an increase of 25 9 bare land cropland and forestland presented relatively lower efficiency in terms of soil water with values of 14 4 14 0 and 12 3 respectively fig 5 for regions with mats of 0 5 and 5 10 grassland presented the greatest beneficial impact on water conservation with values of 50 and 88 respectively in those regions with a mat of 10 15 soil water increased mostly in terraced tree cropland followed by terraced bare land and terraced cropland in the regions of 15 20 the greatest increase in soil moisture was in the grassland with an increase of 34 5 followed by forestland with an increase of 20 0 fig 6 a for humid regions forest terraced land demonstrated the highest efficiency in semi arid regions grassland showed the greatest benefits followed by bare land tree cropland and cropland finally forestland presented the lowest efficiency overall additionally the beneficial effect of tree crops on soil water conservation was highest in semi humid regions fig 6b 3 4 effects of soil layer depth of terraces on soil moisture terracing can significantly promote soil water storage across different soil depths between 0 and 200 cm fig 7 the surface soil layer i e 0 20 cm showed the highest water storage benefit of 26 1 and the benefit always remained greater than 20 across the 0 100 cm depth though it declined significantly below 100 cm furthermore the water storage benefit of terracing at a depth of 100 200 cm was between 10 and 12 fig 7 soil moisture at different depths varied highly with terracing structures and land use types firstly terracing structures can greatly affect water conservation under different soil layers for example the water storage of level terraces in the 0 120 cm soil layer was between 20 and 30 and varied between 10 and 20 in the 120 200 cm soil layer the surface layer 0 20 cm in the reverse slope terraces exhibited a lower water storage benefit and the water storage benefit was higher than 30 at the soil depths of 40 120 cm in contrast the slope separated terraces showed the greatest water storage benefit at the 0 20 cm soil depth layer the efficiency of level ditches was greater than 20 in both shallow and deep soils the surface soil layer 0 20 cm of fish scale pits showed a water storage efficiency of 23 5 whereas the other layers had values less than 20 fig 8 secondly the water conservation benefits of different land use types were also analyzed it was found that a soil depth of 0 80 cm in cropland presented a relatively high benefit of approximately 20 and the benefit at depths below 80 cm was less than 20 the grassland showed a higher water storage benefit in the entire soil layer especially at depths of 0 40 cm and the water storage benefit was greater than 50 the benefit of water storage in the forest was generally lower except for the 40 60 cm layer which had a considerable benefit of 48 7 conversely depth of both 140 160 cm and 180 200 cm showed negative water storage benefits fig 9 3 5 slope gradient effects on soil moisture under different soil depths the effectiveness of terracing on water storage benefit was also affected by the slope gradient in general terraces on different slopes show positive water storage benefits nonetheless the water storage benefit of terraces below 15 was not significant as the 95 confidence interval encompassed 0 with a benefit of approximately 5 the benefit of water storage by terracing was enhanced with an increasing slope gradient above 15 fig 10 on gentle slopes lower than 10 level terraces showed the highest water storage efficiency of 6 2 followed by slope separated terraces 4 0 and slope terraces 3 7 on moderate slopes 10 20 reverse slope terraces and level ditches had higher water storage benefits of 34 6 and 30 4 respectively on steep slopes 20 level ditches and fish scale pits showed greater water storage benefits of 23 1 and 19 1 respectively fig 11 a the bare land and cropland showed an approximately equivalent water storage benefit on gentle slopes below 10 on moderate slopes the water storage benefit of grassland was greatest at 30 5 followed by forestland 13 0 and tree cropland 9 6 on steep slopes 20 the water storage in grassland had the highest benefit of 30 followed by cropland of 20 9 and tree cropland of 11 3 respectively fig 11b 4 discussion 4 1 relationships between terracing structures and soil moisture terracing has been shown to be an effective method of soil and water conservation on slopes and has been widely adopted chen et al 2017 nyssen et al 2009 strehmel et al 2016 wei et al 2019 terracing changes the slope surface to a horizontal plane and the flow lines of the slope flow and the middle stream are continuously cut off thereby eliminating the redistribution of precipitation on the hill slopes rainfall is intercepted such that it can be infiltrated on the spot without causing runoff and sediment flow xu et al 2018 hu et al 2007 this feature is especially obvious in level ditches in china in which an average of 89 of the rainfall infiltrates into soil in the loess plateau for example hu et al 2007 discovered that the effects of level ditches and reforestation on water conservation were better than those of other terracing structures under the same site conditions the average soil water content of underground soil in level ditches was 11 32 which was 9 higher than that of reverse slope terraces 28 6 higher than that of fish scale pits and 46 higher than that of sloped lands respectively this is mainly because rainfall redistribution was directly intercepted on hill slopes and changes in micro topography has reduced runoff loss and thus increased soil water content according to the meta analysis level ditches showed the highest efficiency in terms of soil water storage while level ditches have often been constructed on steep slopes and can intercept most of the surface runoff infiltrate it into soil and redistribute rainfall in time and space fig 3 in addition reverse slope terraces and slope separated terraces can absorb rainfall enhance infiltration and reduce the loss of soil moisture in the lateral ridges fig 2 wang et al 2004 illustrated that reverse slope terraces can create micro

promote soil ripening liang et al 2011 the length of the slope section is generally 3 8 m and slope sections can collect runoff and increase soil moisture on the surface of platform sections this type of slope separated terrace is suitable for planting high yield crops on the platforms e g corn and wheat and economic forests on slopes liang et al 2011 zhang and wu 2012 in general the construction mode and utilization of slope separated terraces are based on topography and local land resources however some studies also captured that the specific structures of level terraces and fish scale pits may have the potential to increase soil air contacting area and finally intensify inefficient evaporation li et al 2014 which need to take mulching measures in practice to reduce such risks 4 2 relationships between climatic location of terracing and soil moisture soil moisture is recharged and regulated by precipitation and temperature wang et al 2018 and the precipitation gradient factor affects soil moisture by regulating soil hydrological processes yang et al 2018 c wang et al 2017 t j wang et al 2017 the semi arid regions of china such as the loess plateau frequently face serious water scarcity issues in this case terracing can improve rainfall infiltration which promotes vegetation restoration and increases soil water evaporation for low precipitation zones even a small increase in soil moisture by terracing is valuable in contrast the efficiency of terracing on water storage is weakest in humid regions fig 4a because soil moisture is no longer the restricted factor for plants and terraces are mainly used for enlarging cultivated paddy areas as well as for flood control in such regions for example c wang et al 2017 t j wang et al 2017 reported a significant linear correlation between soil moisture and map with soil moisture in the grassland more affected by precipitation than that of other land use types soil moisture is depleted over days and weeks primarily by plant uptake transpiration and soil evaporation zhang et al 2017 soil evaporation occurs in shallow layers with lower root density and varies temporally based on available solar energy as reflected by soil temperatures lag behind solar radiation inputs loik et al 2004 therefore temperature can be considered a key factor leading to soil water loss under those conditions of high soil moisture contents in regions with mat 15 c e g yuanmou county in yunnan province the benefit of water conservation is greatest of 43 2 this region is covered by dry and hot valleys with strong evaporation induced by warm temperatures centralized rainfall can induce severe erosion in the summer and severe water shortage in dry seasons fortunately terracing can reduce water erosion alleviate the uneven distribution of soil moisture over seasons and promote vegetation restoration in northeastern china with mat 5 c terracing consequently increased soil water storage when coupled with low water evaporation and low temperatures 4 3 relationships between land use and soil moisture in terraces land use strategies can influence the conservation and efficiency of stored water choudhury 2015 gao et al 2014 zucco et al 2014 in this study grassland terraces presented the highest efficiency of soil water storage and forestland terraces showed the lowest efficiency fig 5 soil moisture influenced by terracing between different land uses has been compared in many catchments of china which have indicated that soil moisture in bare soils is usually higher than that in vegetated soils furthermore soil moisture in annual crops and grasses is higher than that in forests wang et al 2013 li et al 2018 returning farmland to grassland is regarded as one of the best methods for improving soil water retention and reducing soil evaporation in semi arid regions yu et al 2015 li et al 2017 for tree crops the amount of water loss was smaller than that in cropland and bare land which resulted from interception during the water budget balance yu et al 2018 concluded that soil moisture in terraced forestland was lower than that in native grassland and farmland at all spatial domains during both wet and dry periods additionally li et al 2018 indicated that an increase in forest cover significantly reduces soil moisture but that precipitation is suppressed by the weakened summer monsoon in southwestern china in general root water uptake is an important process that controls soil moisture dynamics yang et al 2014a b forestland terraces are mainly covered by introduced vegetation unlike native plants the introduced plant species usually have deep root systems that reach far below precipitation infiltration depths and might consume deeper soil moisture chen et al 2010 yang et al 2014a b for example the root system of maize soybean and stipa bungeana in farmland may be mainly distributed in the 0 100 cm wang et al 2011 while the roots of c korshinskii could extend to 640 cm wang et al 2010 excessive depletion of soil water by a deep root system without sufficient rainwater infiltration can result in a lower level of deep soil moisture in woodlands and shrublands yang et al 2014a b in addition the amount of infiltration is distinct among land use types because of distinct crown interception such as lower infiltration in forests rather than that in grassland yu et al 2015 both precipitation and land use affect the source and consumption of soil moisture which further affect soil moisture variability 4 4 relationships between soil depth and soil moisture in terraces in our research the water storage efficiency of terracing was higher in the soil layers of 0 100 cm fig 7 indeed the water storage benefits of different soil layers in different terraces differed significantly with reverse slope terraces presenting a higher water storage benefit at the soil depth of 40 120 cm and level ditches showing greater efficiency across all soil layers fig 8 chen et al 2008 concluded that water rarely reaches soil below 200 cm in drylands under both natural and simulated rainfall conditions li 2001 explored how soil infiltration impacted by rainfall events might reach 100 300 cm with an average of 200 cm and liu et al 2010 found that shrubs were more sensitive to annual rainfall variation than grasses the characteristics of soil moisture variation suggested that precipitation replenishment is limited for deep layers in terraced fields february and higgins 2010 reported that soil moisture in forestland is mainly affected by plant root systems resulting in a drier zone than upper layers which may explain the relatively lower soil moisture at deeper layers similar results have been reported by others for example weltzin and mcpherson 1997 found that mature trees mainly absorb water from deeper soils than grasses in savannas soil moisture is highly affected by precipitation and micro topography in surface layer whereas mainly influenced by plant roots in deep layers in our study grassland and tree crops presented higher efficiency in deep soil layers fig 9 which reveals that water more easily travels vertically in artificial grasses and tree crops and the amount of infiltration is greater than that of water loss during this process 4 5 relationships between slope gradient and soil moisture in terraces the influence of slope angle on soil moisture distribution has been examined in many studies yang et al 2012 yang et al 2015 lv et al 2013 knowledge of soil water storage by terracing along the slope gradient is necessary to improve land management and to guide restoration practices in terraced fields according to our study terraces present a higher efficiency on steep slopes specifically level terraces and sloped terraces presented greater efficiency on gentle slopes whereas level ditches and fish scale pits showed greater efficiency on steep slopes in the hilly and gully region of northern shaanxi for example bai et al 1998 discovered that when there is a lack of investment it is advisable to adopt level ditches and fish scale pits on slopes of 15 25 the influence of slope gradient on soil water dynamics has two aspects 1 with an increase in slope the soil infiltration rate will decrease which can increase the amount of runoff 2 the effective rainfall captured by the soil will decrease as the slope increases mu et al 2015 indicated that the descending trend of the soil infiltration rate curve increased with increasing rainfall intensity and slope gradient indeed the increased slope resulted in a decrease in the soil infiltration rate that led to an increase in runoff fox et al 1997 also conducted an experiment to study the influence of slope angle on final infiltration rate for inter rill conditions and noted that changes in overland flow depth and surface storage were the main reasons for the dominant influence of the slope angle on the infiltration rate 5 concluding remarks in this meta analysis we identified how terracing affect soil moisture variation under different environmental variables in china a topic that has not been previously investigated the results indicated that terracing has improved soil moisture content by 12 4 on average in china the responses of soil moisture to terracing vary from different terracing structures climatic e g precipitation and temperature zones land uses soil depths and slope gradients level ditches presented the greatest water conservation benefit relative to other terracing structures higher efficiency of terracing on improving soil water was observed in the regions with a semi humid climate and mat in the range of 5 15 grassland terraces presented greater efficiency in semi arid areas with cold climates whereas forest terraces showed higher efficiency in humid and warmer climates level terraces and sloped terraces presented higher efficiency on gentle slopes but level ditches and fish scale pits showed greater efficiency on steep slopes other variables e g terrace age size and management which possibly influence the effectiveness of terraces on soil moisture in china were not considered due to insufficient data our results can provide important implications for terrace construction management and ecosystem services under different environments terraces are considered typical examples of coupled human and nature ecosystems currently terraces are particularly threatened by a lack of financial support and an aging farming population which induce poor conservation and weak maintenance of terraces the effectiveness of terraces however depends on proper construction and regular maintenance due to the increasing challenges of abandonment and collapsing risks the central and local governments should formulate effective measures to preserve terraces by providing financial incentives to farmers to maintain terraced landscapes regularly only through this path the sustainable development of terrace ecosystems can be achieved which finally benefit the natural ecosystems and enhancing human well being acknowledgments this work was supported by the national key r

10824,vegetation water content vwc is of vital significance to many applications in agriculture such as crop yield estimation and precision irrigation however previous studies mainly estimate vwc at either high spatial resolution or temporal resolution due to the limitation of space borne observation systems in this paper we target on monitoring daily plant vwc as well as canopy vwc at 30 m high spatial resolution with the fusion of optical measurements from the land remote sensing satellite landsat operational land imager oli and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis in an agricultural area the study area locates in the central of iowa the united states usa the study period ranges from august 1 to august 17 2016 landsat 8 oli observations are with 16 day revisit cycle and 30 m spatial resolution modis daily surface reflectance product used in this study has 500 m spatial resolution six landsat oli images and thirty modis images were used to estimate daily remotely sensed reflectance data at 30m first then the fused satellite measurements were used to calculate normalized difference water index ndwi ground based plant vwc and canopy vwc measurements were collected during the soil moisture active passive validation experiment smapvex16 to calibrate and validate the model for plant vmc and canopy vwc estimation separately with the ndwi the results of validation with in situ measurements showed an r2 of 0 44 for the corn plant vwc an r2 of 0 66 for the corn canopy vwc and an r2 of 0 78 for the soybean plant vwc an r2 of 0 85 for the soybean canopy vwc respectively keywords vegetation water content downscaling data fusion landsat 8 modis ndwi 1 introduction the physical definition of vegetation water content vwc is volume of water content in vegetation hunt et al 2011 yilmaz et al 2008a b vwc is of vital importance in crop yield estimation agricultural drought monitoring and microwave surface soil moisture retrieval huete et al 1994 gómez plaza et al 2001 ceccato et al 2002 kim et al 2011 jackson et al 2004 njoku and chan 2006 notarnicola and posa 2007 vwc can be classified into leaf plant and canopy scales hunt et al 2011 leaf vwc which is also called equivalent water thickness ewt is the water mass per leaf unit area with unit in kilogram per square meter ceccato et al 2001 jacquemoud et al 2009 plant vwc is the ratio of water content weight to whole plant weight with unit in kilogram per plant it provides key information for agricultural applications as inferring water stress for irrigation decision making yield estimation and assess drought conditions canopy vwc is the water mass of vegetation per ground area with unit in kilogram per square meter canopy vwc plays a significant role in microwave soil moisture retrieval once the vwc can be monitored more accurately from satellite observations soil moisture retrieval through microwave observations can be improved jackson et al 2004 njoku and chan 2006 notarnicola and posa 2007 in addition vwc is also useful in forestry to determine fire susceptibility for wildland fire risk monitoring fensholt and sandholt 2003 tucker 1980 claudio et al 2006 various studies have investigated the potential of using surface reflectance data to estimate vwc hunt et al 2011 yilmaz et al 2008a b fensholt and sandholt 2003 tucker 1980 claudio et al 2006 vivoni et al 2008 wang et al 2008 2013 chen and brutsaert 1998 microwave bands are very sensitive to land surface moisture content entekhabi et al 2010 hunt et al 2011 jackson et al 1982 kerr et al 2001 kim et al 2011 njoku and chan 2006 notarnicola and posa 2007 microwave technique has been widely applied to soil moisture monitoring but it hasn t been used that much for estimating vwc compare with solar reflectance bands microwave singles have moderate surface penetration the moisture content retrieved from microwave bands includes both surface soil moisture content and moisture from crop cover for an agricultural or forestry area so monitoring vwc is of vital significant in improving the accuracy of surface soil moisture retrieval through microwave methods vwc is an important factor considering for many soil moisture satellite techniques such as smap smos sentinel series jackson et al 1982 kerr et al 2001 entekhabi et al 2010 the normalized different vegetation index ndvi is one of the most popular vegetation indexes to monitor vegetation living conditions but it has limited success when applied to vwc estimation chen et al 2005 huang et al 2009 sims and gamon 2003 ndvi is calculated with the spectral reflectance of red band and near infrared band the red band has strong chlorophyll absorption rather than water which means that ndvi is optimal for chlorophyll estimation instead of vwc chen et al 2005 huang et al 2009 further studies have applied normalized different water index ndwi and normalized different infrared index ndii to monitor vwc hunt et al 2011 wang et al 2013 gao 1996 both ndwi and ndii are targeting on the strong water absorption features of shortwave infrared swir bands hunt et al 2011 wang et al 2013 gao 1996 chen et al 2003 chakroun 2017 gao and goetzt 1995 fig 1 demonstrates simulated leaf reflectance with the prospect model at three different leaf water content levels jacquemoud et al 2009 from fig 1 the shortwave infrared bands 1200 2500 nm are very sensitive to leaf water content showing strong absorptions compared with visible 400 700 nm and near infrared bands 800 1000 nm gao 1996 chen et al 2003 chakroun 2017 previous studies have shown that ndwi is much better than ndvi for vegetation water content estimation chen et al 2005 huang et al 2009 gao and goetzt 1995 however before the mission of modis few sensors observed shortwave infrared reflectance which limits the practical use of ndwi for vwc retrieval the 16 day revisit cycle of landsat 8 satellite and cloud cover make it difficult to use oli for continuous monitoring of vegetation water content with ndwi data fusion of multiple satellite remote sensing measurements with different resolutions at spatial and temporal scales has the potential to address the challenge of vwc monitoring with good resolution at both spatial and temporal scales previous studies have been conducted to generate satellite observation with good spatial and temporal resolution by combining landsat with modis measurements such as the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model starfm gao et al 2006 the original starfm techniques have been revised as various improved methods targeting on specific applications for instance sadfat targets on thermal near infrared bands fusion for further land surface temperature downscaling sti fm focuses on image processing weng et al 2014 hazaymeh and hassan 2015 during the soil moisture active passive validation experiment 2016 smapvex16 ground based vwc at various scales were sampled we explored the potential of using remotely sensed observations to monitor vwc for both corn and soybean fields the main objectives are to generate high quality vwc estimation for the microwave remote sensing soil moisture and evapotranspiration studies conducted during smapvex16 and to do a favor to the development of agricultural drought monitoring and assessment this study proposes a revised vwc estimation approach with an improved data fusion technique the main innovation of this study is to monitor vwc at both plant and canopy scales with good spatial 30 m and temporal resolution daily by combining modis and landsat 8 measurements during the crop reproductive growth stage in the major agricultural area in the u s we downscaled satellite observation to high resolution because the 30 m high spatial resolution assuring the vegetation conditions and related lands surface properties within a pixel can be considered homogeneous 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area locates on a plain within the central of iowa the united states u s it is one of the main agricultural and grain production areas in the u s soybean and corn are two of the major vegetation types in the study area the study area called south fork experimental watershed was chosen in this study it is with relatively homogeneous soil type and vegetation cover the latitude of this site ranges from 42 2 n to 42 7 n and the longitude from 93 6 w to 93 2 w the climate is sub humid the annual average precipitation is around 800 mm smapvex16 leading by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the united states department of agriculture usda was conducted in 2016 from may to august mainly aimed at smap soil moisture product validation and calibration since vwc is a significant factor for surface soil moisture estimation vwc sampling was conducted in may and august in this field campaign for corn and soybean fields fig 2 a illustrates the relative position of the study area in iowa fig 2b is the geolocation of the soybean sampling sites as marked by circle and corn sampling sites as marked by star within the ground measurements a review of the vegetation sampling has been done by cosh et al 2019 2 2 data 2 2 1 satellite datasets we used terra modis and landsat 8 oli infrared and shortwave infrared reflectance observations in this study to generate daily 30 m vwc measurements oli carried by landsat 8 satellite can generate 16 day revisit global 30 m multispectral observations with 11 bands landsat 8 band 5 as near infrared band band 6 as shortwave infrared band were selected to fused with modis corresponding bands then calculate ndwi ndwi was used to retrieve vwc in the following steps the study area is covered by two landsat 8 scenes scene path 26 row 31 and scene path 27 row 30 six landsat 8 images with acquisition dates of july 22nd july 31st august 7th august 16th august 23rd september 1st and thirty modis daily images from july 26th to august 24th were selected to generate daily 30 m reflectance datasets from july 26th to august 24th modis is a significant sensor carried by both aqua and terra satellites with 36 spectral bands measurements in this study we used terra modis level 2 surface reflectance product mod09 and modis level 2 atmospheric precipitable water product mod05 l2 daily 500 m mod09ga product was used further to fused with landsat bands with similar wavelength to generate near infrared and shortwave infrared reflectance measurements at both high spatial and temporal resolution mod05 can generate a cloud mask to exclude the invalid pixels in the study area landsat 8 near infrared band 5 and modis near infrared band 2 have similar wavelengths centered at 0 86 μm they were used to fuse the near infrared band while landsat 8 shortwave infrared band 6 and modis shortwave infrared band 6 have similar wavelengths centered at 1 64 μm they were selected for the shortwave infrared band fusion the fused near infrared reflectance data and shortwave infrared reflectance data were used to calculate the ndwi to estimate vwc the ndwi value can be calculated through eq 1 1 n d w i ρ n i r ρ s w i r ρ n i r ρ s w i r where ρ n i r is the reflectance of the near infrared band 0 86 μm and ρ s w i r is the reflectance of the shortwave infrared band 1 64 μm modis and landsat 8 observations have different map projection and resolutions mod09 and mod05 products were preprocessed with modis tool mrt provided by nasa to the utm projection and 30 m spatial resolution before the fusion step 2 2 2 in situ measurements vwc sampling data were available for both corn and soybean sites the selection of both corn and soybean sampling sites were semi randomly selected though onsite judgement to determine if the site was anomalous for any obvious reason most of the corn and soybean plants were observed to be healthy through the whole sampling period the sowing period of corn fields ranges from april to may and for soybean fields the sowing period is usually from the end of april to the mid june there were two intensive observing periods iops during the field experiment in iop 1 may 25th to june 5th the crops were either not yet emerged or small and only consisted of leaves therefore the whole plant was weighed before and after totally dried we weighted the whole plant and counted the leaf amount for each plant only limited sites were sampled within iop1 in iop 2 from august 3rd to august 16th we weighed pod or corn stem and leaf from every sampled plant separately and counted the leaf amount and stem height as well the growth stage during iop2 for corn field contains silking dented and dough for soybean field contains blooming coloring and setting pods due to cloudy weather conditions during iop1 limited sites were available to build the monitoring model therefore we only focus on the vwc monitoring within iop2 in august in this study at each sampling site three sub sites were chosen starting from the entry point of the field and then at regular intervals diagonally across the field the first sub site was chosen with 100 m distance from the edge of the field the second and third sub sites were chosen by walking diagonally 100 m from the previous sub site a row will be selected randomly at each sub site to measure the row spacing density and direction the row density was measure by counting the number of plants within one meter the row properties were measured three times at each subsite five plants were measured and collected for each subsite both for corn and soybean fields the collected crop was separated to leaf stem and soybean pod corn parts leaf number stem height and stem diameter were measured as well each part was weighed before and after it was totally dried in the oven to estimate the water content and dry matter content and we used the averaged value of each subsite to calibrate and validate the retrieved vwc from remote sensing measurements 3 methodology the main steps for daily vwc estimation at 30 m resolution include a fusion of oli and modis data with an improved data fusion method b calculation of vegetation index using the fused reflectance measurements c calibration and validation of vwc retrieval equation d generation of daily vwc data with the calibrated retrieval equation fig 3 is the flow chart of the main procedures the improved reflectance bands fusion model we proposed in this study was based on the assumptions that the corresponding bands of landsat 8 and modis are highly consistent with relative similar wavelength gao et al 2006 ke et al 2015 and study is conducted within homogeneous area the area of this study is with two main crop types that can be considered as homogeneous within 30 m spatial resolution both modis and landsat 8 have near infrared band centered at 1 64 μm and shortwave infrared band centered at 0 86 μm the two channels spectral reflectance generated by different sensors were fused firstly to get daily ndwi measurements at 30 m spatial resolution then specific crop type s vwc at different scales were retrieved based on the relationship between vwc and ndwi zarco tejada et al 2003 fig 4 a is the histogram of difference between landsat 8 and modis near infrared band spectral reflectance where x axis represents the difference y axis represents the percentage of the number of pixels in each corresponding bin to the total number of pixels the bias between landsat 8 and modis near infrared band spectral reflectance is 0 0279 the standard deviation is 0 0433 fig 4 b is the histogram of different between landsat 8 and modis shortwave infrared band spectral reflectance where x axis is the difference y axis has the same meaning as fig 4 a the bias between landsat 8 and modis shortwave infrared band spectral reflectance is 0 0184 the standard deviation is 0 0346 when ingested within a small enough time interval different sensors reflectance observations with similar wavelength can be considered correlated and can be fused after radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction for homogenous pixels xu et al 2018 landsat 8 and modis dataset were acquired with time interval less than 10 min so we can consider the landsat 8 and modis observations collected at the same time modis l1b data quality flag and modis cloud mask products were applied in this study to exclude invalid or anomalous values landsat quality assessment qa band for pixel level condition and validity flags were checked as well modis were resampled to 30 m spatial resolution and the same map projection as landsat 8 through mrt provided by nasa before downscaling the fusion method in this study was developed based on starfm starfm aims at downscaling ndvi mainly targeting at near infrared bands fusion in this study both the fusion of near infrared and shortwave infrared are needed in previous work spectral radiance was fused firstly then calculate the reflectance value xu et al 2018 in this study the reflectance data were fused directly both level 2 modis and landsat 8 reflectance datasets were selected as shown in the flowchart a regression model was built based on the linear relationship between landsat 8 and resampled 30 m modis reflectance of the bands with similar wavelength on observed day l means the landsat 8 spectral reflectance m means the modis spectral reflectance of the corresponding band to means the observed time tp means the predicted time m and n are regression parameters we assumed m is a constant for same wavelength through the model we can generate reflectance at time tp with 30 m spatial resolution if we have modis measurements at time to and time tp and landsat measurements at time to in order to eliminate spatial and spectrum variation we accounted those in the weighting

the initial window size s is the spectral weighting function d is the distance weighting function a is a constant depends on the land cover type a is the threshold if the sum of difference between neighboring pixels reflectance is larger than a the window size should be increased by a factor of two due to the short study period and cloud cover in order to collect more valuable satellite observation landsat observation with cloud cover was replace by the landsat observation of the next closest time within the same region the regression model was applied to the resampled modis measurements on the predicted day downscaled reflectance can be generated based on the modis reflectance through the model then the regression models were built to estimate vwc with ndwi we mainly focused on plant vwc and canopy vwc in this study ground based vwc for plant and canopy can be generated as shown in eqs 6 and 7 separately plant vwc is the total water mass counted from leaf part stem part and pod part together in this study we collected all parts together as plant water content and generate the average plant vwc per site canopy vwc is the total plant water content per unit

soybean fields of the same study area through linear model with ndwi jackson et al 2002 chen et al 2002 cosh et al 2019 we randomly selected half ground observations collected from the field work to build the vwc retrieval model and used the rest to validate the model the least squares method is used to calibrate the linear model 8 v w c p l a n t a 1 n d w i b 1 9 v w c c a n o p y a 2 n d w i b

were fused to generate daily reflectance measurements with a 30 m spatial resolution the downscaled nir and swir reflectance were used to calculate daily ndwi with 30 m spatial resolution which was used to estimate vwc as well compared with landsat 8 near infrared band the statistical results of fused reflectance value is with r2 of 0 91 rmse of 0 09 compared with landsat 8 shortwave infrared band the statistical results of fused reflectance value is with r2 of 0 88 rmse of 0 07 compared with the ndwi value calculated from landsat 8 directly the statistical results of fused ndwi value is with r2 of 0 89 rmse of 0 04 the parameters of the trained linear model for corn and soybean plant vwc have been listed in table 1a the empirical parameters for corn and soybean canopy vwc have been listed in table 1b separately figs 5 and 6 show the scatter plots between observed and predicted vwc for corn and soybean fields separately the red diagonal line means observed value equals to predicted one therefore the distribution along the red line means monitored results with high r2 low absolute error and low rmse when focusing on iop2 ndwi can be used to retrieve plant vwc and canopy vwc both for corn and soybean with relatively good results although there exists a linear relationship between vwc and ndwi for both corn and soybean fields different crop type needs to be studied separately results show that same ndwi value may indicate different vwc for different crop type the coefficients vary with crop types ndwi value ranges from 0 44 to 0 53 for corn field while it ranges from 0 37 to 0 58 for soybean field within the same period corn field shows relative higher plant vwc with the same ndwi value with the increase of ndwi plant vwc increase rapidly for corn field compared with soybean filed in this study soybean field shows better statistical results with higher r2 both at plant and canopy level this may be caused by the influence of leaves growth angle and different canopy structures on near infrared and shortwave infrared bands reflectance table 2 as mentioned previously the study area was covered by two landsat 8 scenes we used both path 27 row 30 and path 26 row 31 landsat 8 observations there are only two landsat 8 observation available within the study period on august 7th and august 16th within these two landsat 8 passing days cloud contamination is relatively high in the study area if we only use landsat 8 to retrieve vwc too limited ground measurement is available to build the vwc retrieval model and validate the retrieved results by fusing landsat 8 with modis similar wavelength reflectance measurements through the improved downscaling method we can generate daily 30 m vwc with satellite observations and use ground based vwc on all sampling day to validate the results figs 7 and 8 show the time series of observed and predicted canopy vwc for corn and soybean sites separately sf01 ltar corn sf14 s32 sf04 sf02 s10 jpl cron s36 s31 sf10 s09 represents corn field sampling site id ltar soy s19 na04 s02 s03 s14 s21 s13 sf03 s18 s17 sf07 represents soybean field sampling site id from the time series of each sampling site we can figure out both the predicted and observed vwc increase with time the trend of the predicted value matches the observed ones quite well both for corn and soybean fields which means the model can be used to estimate vwc from satellite observations previously many field experiments have been done for the same study region remote sensing techniques have been applied to retrieve vwc successfully different from this study only one satellite sensor has been applied to estimate vwc combine ground truth measurements for instance jackson et al estimated corn and soybean canopy vwc through landsat 7 etm from mid june 2002 to mid july 2002 during smex02 field campaign for the same region with larger study area a growth curve of vwc for each crop type was developed to generate daily ground based observation both ndvi and ndwi were calculated to monitor canopy vwc for corn and soybean field separately ndwi showed better statistical results compared with ndvi with rmse is 0 73 kg m2 for corn field rmse is 0 20 kg m2 for soybean field chen et al monitored vwc with the same field campaign through modis observations same as the former one ndwi showed better results compared with ndvi with r2 is 0 74 for corn canopy vwc r2 is 0 52 for soybean canopy vwc recently a similar study has been done by cosh et al monitoring canopy vwc focusing on the same field experiment temporal interpolation was applied to generate daily 30 m observations from 16 day landsat 8 products while there exists no clear relationship between landsat 8 reflectance change with time different from this study the whole growing period from may to august was considered with rmse of corn canopy vwc is 1 37 kg m2 rmse of soybean canopy vwc is 1 10 kg m2 this study shows better results both for corn and soybean fields compared with the former work fig 9 a is the image representing spatial distribution of plant vwc on aug 10th 2016 fig 9 b is the image of canopy vwc on the same day respectively the error sources in this study mainly consist four parts 1 satellite observations both from landsat 8 and modis the satellite surface reflectance observations and vegetation indices calculated may introduce various sources of uncertainty such as atmospheric effects error from retrieval procedures weather effects and the degradation of sensors 2 error from ground observing the error from ground observing mainly from three ways error from instruments human induced error while conducting the experiments experiment design error when researchers designed the field campaign although site representative decreasing human and instrument induced deviation and re calibration have been considered carefully error may still be introduced in unexpected ways 3 error from fusion model the improved fusion model applied in this study consider there exist linear relationship between modis and landsat 8 reflectance bands with similar wavelength on observing and predicting date in reality the relationship between modis and landsat 8 in more complicated than linear relationship besides that we treat the effects from surrounding pixels the same to the central pixel the relationship between neighboring pixels is unknow yet 4 error from vwc modeling model ndwi vwc relationship we simplified the vwc monitoring model in this study to just consider ndwi there are several other factors that may affect vwc monitoring and ndwi vwc model parameter as well such as soil moisture surface temperature leaf area index 5 discussion up to now most downscaling studies to fuse modis and landsat bands mainly focused on ndvi and lst estimation in this study we revised an existing fusion model to combine modis and landsat 8 near infrared and shortwave infrared reflectance to generate daily 30 m ndwi for the estimation of various scales vwc at both good spatial and temporal resolution for different crop types through data fusion daily plant and canopy vwc at 30 m spatial resolution were obtained the results show linear relationship between ndwi and plant canopy vwc within the crop reproductive growing stage for both corn and soybean fields the limitation for this study is that we only have in situ observations for a short period missed observation for vwc with the corresponding ndwi ranges from 0 1 to 0 3 with broader dynamic ranges of ndwi and vwc the relationships may change for example some previous works found nonlinear relationships chen et al 2003 jackson et al 2004 6 conclusion this paper proposed an improved downscaling method to generate daily 30 m surface reflectance measurements within the study area by combining modis and landsat 8 then mapping various scales vwc with high resolutions for corn and soybean fields separately based on a regression model through ndwi datasets firstly we overcome the difficulty of using ground observation to train and validate the vwc monitoring model through satellite derived vegetation index ndwi since limited valid ground measurements can be collected by field experiments we downscaled daily 500 m modis surface reflectance bands measurements by fusing 16 day 30 m landsat 8 observations for bands with similar wavelength through a revised data fusion model to generate daily plant and canopy vwc at 30 m spatial resolution during crop growing season secondly vwc at plant and canopy scales were retrieved separately the plant vwc and canopy vwc play significant roles to indicate agriculture drought condition as well as leaf water content and may be applied to further microwave soil moisture monitoring thirdly corn field and soybean field were studied separately the rmse of corn and soybean field plant vwc is 0 1 kg plant and 0 02 kg plant the rmse of corn and soybean field canopy vwc is 1 31 kg m2 and 0 94 kg m2 respectively the r2 of corn and soybean field plant vwc is 0 44 and 0 78 the r2 of corn and soybean field canopy vwc is 0 66 and 0 85 only with high spatial resolution different crop types can be classified effectively and study area within satellite footprint can be considered homogeneous the vwc varies a lot for corn and soybean fields with the same ndwi value both for plant and canopy scales which illustrated that same ndwi value indicates different vwc for different plant type author contributions michael h cosh designed the overall field

10824,vegetation water content vwc is of vital significance to many applications in agriculture such as crop yield estimation and precision irrigation however previous studies mainly estimate vwc at either high spatial resolution or temporal resolution due to the limitation of space borne observation systems in this paper we target on monitoring daily plant vwc as well as canopy vwc at 30 m high spatial resolution with the fusion of optical measurements from the land remote sensing satellite landsat operational land imager oli and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis in an agricultural area the study area locates in the central of iowa the united states usa the study period ranges from august 1 to august 17 2016 landsat 8 oli observations are with 16 day revisit cycle and 30 m spatial resolution modis daily surface reflectance product used in this study has 500 m spatial resolution six landsat oli images and thirty modis images were used to estimate daily remotely sensed reflectance data at 30m first then the fused satellite measurements were used to calculate normalized difference water index ndwi ground based plant vwc and canopy vwc measurements were collected during the soil moisture active passive validation experiment smapvex16 to calibrate and validate the model for plant vmc and canopy vwc estimation separately with the ndwi the results of validation with in situ measurements showed an r2 of 0 44 for the corn plant vwc an r2 of 0 66 for the corn canopy vwc and an r2 of 0 78 for the soybean plant vwc an r2 of 0 85 for the soybean canopy vwc respectively keywords vegetation water content downscaling data fusion landsat 8 modis ndwi 1 introduction the physical definition of vegetation water content vwc is volume of water content in vegetation hunt et al 2011 yilmaz et al 2008a b vwc is of vital importance in crop yield estimation agricultural drought monitoring and microwave surface soil moisture retrieval huete et al 1994 gómez plaza et al 2001 ceccato et al 2002 kim et al 2011 jackson et al 2004 njoku and chan 2006 notarnicola and posa 2007 vwc can be classified into leaf plant and canopy scales hunt et al 2011 leaf vwc which is also called equivalent water thickness ewt is the water mass per leaf unit area with unit in kilogram per square meter ceccato et al 2001 jacquemoud et al 2009 plant vwc is the ratio of water content weight to whole plant weight with unit in kilogram per plant it provides key information for agricultural applications as inferring water stress for irrigation decision making yield estimation and assess drought conditions canopy vwc is the water mass of vegetation per ground area with unit in kilogram per square meter canopy vwc plays a significant role in microwave soil moisture retrieval once the vwc can be monitored more accurately from satellite observations soil moisture retrieval through microwave observations can be improved jackson et al 2004 njoku and chan 2006 notarnicola and posa 2007 in addition vwc is also useful in forestry to determine fire susceptibility for wildland fire risk monitoring fensholt and sandholt 2003 tucker 1980 claudio et al 2006 various studies have investigated the potential of using surface reflectance data to estimate vwc hunt et al 2011 yilmaz et al 2008a b fensholt and sandholt 2003 tucker 1980 claudio et al 2006 vivoni et al 2008 wang et al 2008 2013 chen and brutsaert 1998 microwave bands are very sensitive to land surface moisture content entekhabi et al 2010 hunt et al 2011 jackson et al 1982 kerr et al 2001 kim et al 2011 njoku and chan 2006 notarnicola and posa 2007 microwave technique has been widely applied to soil moisture monitoring but it hasn t been used that much for estimating vwc compare with solar reflectance bands microwave singles have moderate surface penetration the moisture content retrieved from microwave bands includes both surface soil moisture content and moisture from crop cover for an agricultural or forestry area so monitoring vwc is of vital significant in improving the accuracy of surface soil moisture retrieval through microwave methods vwc is an important factor considering for many soil moisture satellite techniques such as smap smos sentinel series jackson et al 1982 kerr et al 2001 entekhabi et al 2010 the normalized different vegetation index ndvi is one of the most popular vegetation indexes to monitor vegetation living conditions but it has limited success when applied to vwc estimation chen et al 2005 huang et al 2009 sims and gamon 2003 ndvi is calculated with the spectral reflectance of red band and near infrared band the red band has strong chlorophyll absorption rather than water which means that ndvi is optimal for chlorophyll estimation instead of vwc chen et al 2005 huang et al 2009 further studies have applied normalized different water index ndwi and normalized different infrared index ndii to monitor vwc hunt et al 2011 wang et al 2013 gao 1996 both ndwi and ndii are targeting on the strong water absorption features of shortwave infrared swir bands hunt et al 2011 wang et al 2013 gao 1996 chen et al 2003 chakroun 2017 gao and goetzt 1995 fig 1 demonstrates simulated leaf reflectance with the prospect model at three different leaf water content levels jacquemoud et al 2009 from fig 1 the shortwave infrared bands 1200 2500 nm are very sensitive to leaf water content showing strong absorptions compared with visible 400 700 nm and near infrared bands 800 1000 nm gao 1996 chen et al 2003 chakroun 2017 previous studies have shown that ndwi is much better than ndvi for vegetation water content estimation chen et al 2005 huang et al 2009 gao and goetzt 1995 however before the mission of modis few sensors observed shortwave infrared reflectance which limits the practical use of ndwi for vwc retrieval the 16 day revisit cycle of landsat 8 satellite and cloud cover make it difficult to use oli for continuous monitoring of vegetation water content with ndwi data fusion of multiple satellite remote sensing measurements with different resolutions at spatial and temporal scales has the potential to address the challenge of vwc monitoring with good resolution at both spatial and temporal scales previous studies have been conducted to generate satellite observation with good spatial and temporal resolution by combining landsat with modis measurements such as the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model starfm gao et al 2006 the original starfm techniques have been revised as various improved methods targeting on specific applications for instance sadfat targets on thermal near infrared bands fusion for further land surface temperature downscaling sti fm focuses on image processing weng et al 2014 hazaymeh and hassan 2015 during the soil moisture active passive validation experiment 2016 smapvex16 ground based vwc at various scales were sampled we explored the potential of using remotely sensed observations to monitor vwc for both corn and soybean fields the main objectives are to generate high quality vwc estimation for the microwave remote sensing soil moisture and evapotranspiration studies conducted during smapvex16 and to do a favor to the development of agricultural drought monitoring and assessment this study proposes a revised vwc estimation approach with an improved data fusion technique the main innovation of this study is to monitor vwc at both plant and canopy scales with good spatial 30 m and temporal resolution daily by combining modis and landsat 8 measurements during the crop reproductive growth stage in the major agricultural area in the u s we downscaled satellite observation to high resolution because the 30 m high spatial resolution assuring the vegetation conditions and related lands surface properties within a pixel can be considered homogeneous 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area locates on a plain within the central of iowa the united states u s it is one of the main agricultural and grain production areas in the u s soybean and corn are two of the major vegetation types in the study area the study area called south fork experimental watershed was chosen in this study it is with relatively homogeneous soil type and vegetation cover the latitude of this site ranges from 42 2 n to 42 7 n and the longitude from 93 6 w to 93 2 w the climate is sub humid the annual average precipitation is around 800 mm smapvex16 leading by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the united states department of agriculture usda was conducted in 2016 from may to august mainly aimed at smap soil moisture product validation and calibration since vwc is a significant factor for surface soil moisture estimation vwc sampling was conducted in may and august in this field campaign for corn and soybean fields fig 2 a illustrates the relative position of the study area in iowa fig 2b is the geolocation of the soybean sampling sites as marked by circle and corn sampling sites as marked by star within the ground measurements a review of the vegetation sampling has been done by cosh et al 2019 2 2 data 2 2 1 satellite datasets we used terra modis and landsat 8 oli infrared and shortwave infrared reflectance observations in this study to generate daily 30 m vwc measurements oli carried by landsat 8 satellite can generate 16 day revisit global 30 m multispectral observations with 11 bands landsat 8 band 5 as near infrared band band 6 as shortwave infrared band were selected to fused with modis corresponding bands then calculate ndwi ndwi was used to retrieve vwc in the following steps the study area is covered by two landsat 8 scenes scene path 26 row 31 and scene path 27 row 30 six landsat 8 images with acquisition dates of july 22nd july 31st august 7th august 16th august 23rd september 1st and thirty modis daily images from july 26th to august 24th were selected to generate daily 30 m reflectance datasets from july 26th to august 24th modis is a significant sensor carried by both aqua and terra satellites with 36 spectral bands measurements in this study we used terra modis level 2 surface reflectance product mod09 and modis level 2 atmospheric precipitable water product mod05 l2 daily 500 m mod09ga product was used further to fused with landsat bands with similar wavelength to generate near infrared and shortwave infrared reflectance measurements at both high spatial and temporal resolution mod05 can generate a cloud mask to exclude the invalid pixels in the study area landsat 8 near infrared band 5 and modis near infrared band 2 have similar wavelengths centered at 0 86 μm they were used to fuse the near infrared band while landsat 8 shortwave infrared band 6 and modis shortwave infrared band 6 have similar wavelengths centered at 1 64 μm they were selected for the shortwave infrared band fusion the fused near infrared reflectance data and shortwave infrared reflectance data were used to calculate the ndwi to estimate vwc the ndwi value can be calculated through eq 1 1 n d w i ρ n i r ρ s w i r ρ n i r ρ s w i r where ρ n i r is the reflectance of the near infrared band 0 86 μm and ρ s w i r is the reflectance of the shortwave infrared band 1 64 μm modis and landsat 8 observations have different map projection and resolutions mod09 and mod05 products were preprocessed with modis tool mrt provided by nasa to the utm projection and 30 m spatial resolution before the fusion step 2 2 2 in situ measurements vwc sampling data were available for both corn and soybean sites the selection of both corn and soybean sampling sites were semi randomly selected though onsite judgement to determine if the site was anomalous for any obvious reason most of the corn and soybean plants were observed to be healthy through the whole sampling period the sowing period of corn fields ranges from april to may and for soybean fields the sowing period is usually from the end of april to the mid june there were two intensive observing periods iops during the field experiment in iop 1 may 25th to june 5th the crops were either not yet emerged or small and only consisted of leaves therefore the whole plant was weighed before and after totally dried we weighted the whole plant and counted the leaf amount for each plant only limited sites were sampled within iop1 in iop 2 from august 3rd to august 16th we weighed pod or corn stem and leaf from every sampled plant separately and counted the leaf amount and stem height as well the growth stage during iop2 for corn field contains silking dented and dough for soybean field contains blooming coloring and setting pods due to cloudy weather conditions during iop1 limited sites were available to build the monitoring model therefore we only focus on the vwc monitoring within iop2 in august in this study at each sampling site three sub sites were chosen starting from the entry point of the field and then at regular intervals diagonally across the field the first sub site was chosen with 100 m distance from the edge of the field the second and third sub sites were chosen by walking diagonally 100 m from the previous sub site a row will be selected randomly at each sub site to measure the row spacing density and direction the row density was measure by counting the number of plants within one meter the row properties were measured three times at each subsite five plants were measured and collected for each subsite both for corn and soybean fields the collected crop was separated to leaf stem and soybean pod corn parts leaf number stem height and stem diameter were measured as well each part was weighed before and after it was totally dried in the oven to estimate the water content and dry matter content and we used the averaged value of each subsite to calibrate and validate the retrieved vwc from remote sensing measurements 3 methodology the main steps for daily vwc estimation at 30 m resolution include a fusion of oli and modis data with an improved data fusion method b calculation of vegetation index using the fused reflectance measurements c calibration and validation of vwc retrieval equation d generation of daily vwc data with the calibrated retrieval equation fig 3 is the flow chart of the main procedures the improved reflectance bands fusion model we proposed in this study was based on the assumptions that the corresponding bands of landsat 8 and modis are highly consistent with relative similar wavelength gao et al 2006 ke et al 2015 and study is conducted within homogeneous area the area of this study is with two main crop types that can be considered as homogeneous within 30 m spatial resolution both modis and landsat 8 have near infrared band centered at 1 64 μm and shortwave infrared band centered at 0 86 μm the two channels spectral reflectance generated by different sensors were fused firstly to get daily ndwi measurements at 30 m spatial resolution then specific crop type s vwc at different scales were retrieved based on the relationship between vwc and ndwi zarco tejada et al 2003 fig 4 a is the histogram of difference between landsat 8 and modis near infrared band spectral reflectance where x axis represents the difference y axis represents the percentage of the number of pixels in each corresponding bin to the total number of pixels the bias between landsat 8 and modis near infrared band spectral reflectance is 0 0279 the standard deviation is 0 0433 fig 4 b is the histogram of different between landsat 8 and modis shortwave infrared band spectral reflectance where x axis is the difference y axis has the same meaning as fig 4 a the bias between landsat 8 and modis shortwave infrared band spectral reflectance is 0 0184 the standard deviation is 0 0346 when ingested within a small enough time interval different sensors reflectance observations with similar wavelength can be considered correlated and can be fused after radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction for homogenous pixels xu et al 2018 landsat 8 and modis dataset were acquired with time interval less than 10 min so we can consider the landsat 8 and modis observations collected at the same time modis l1b data quality flag and modis cloud mask products were applied in this study to exclude invalid or anomalous values landsat quality assessment qa band for pixel level condition and validity flags were checked as well modis were resampled to 30 m spatial resolution and the same map projection as landsat 8 through mrt provided by nasa before downscaling the fusion method in this study was developed based on starfm starfm aims at downscaling ndvi mainly targeting at near infrared bands fusion in this study both the fusion of near infrared and shortwave infrared are needed in previous work spectral radiance was fused firstly then calculate the reflectance value xu et al 2018 in this study the reflectance data were fused directly both level 2 modis and landsat 8 reflectance datasets were selected as shown in the flowchart a regression model was built based on the linear relationship between landsat 8 and resampled 30 m modis reflectance of the bands with similar wavelength on observed day l means the landsat 8 spectral reflectance m means the modis spectral reflectance of the corresponding band to means the observed time tp means the predicted time m and n are regression parameters we assumed m is a constant for same wavelength through the model we can generate reflectance at time tp with 30 m spatial resolution if we have modis measurements at time to and time tp and landsat measurements at time to in order to eliminate spatial and spectrum variation we accounted those in the weighting

the initial window size s is the spectral weighting function d is the distance weighting function a is a constant depends on the land cover type a is the threshold if the sum of difference between neighboring pixels reflectance is larger than a the window size should be increased by a factor of two due to the short study period and cloud cover in order to collect more valuable satellite observation landsat observation with cloud cover was replace by the landsat observation of the next closest time within the same region the regression model was applied to the resampled modis measurements on the predicted day downscaled reflectance can be generated based on the modis reflectance through the model then the regression models were built to estimate vwc with ndwi we mainly focused on plant vwc and canopy vwc in this study ground based vwc for plant and canopy can be generated as shown in eqs 6 and 7 separately plant vwc is the total water mass counted from leaf part stem part and pod part together in this study we collected all parts together as plant water content and generate the average plant vwc per site canopy vwc is the total plant water content per unit

soybean fields of the same study area through linear model with ndwi jackson et al 2002 chen et al 2002 cosh et al 2019 we randomly selected half ground observations collected from the field work to build the vwc retrieval model and used the rest to validate the model the least squares method is used to calibrate the linear model 8 v w c p l a n t a 1 n d w i b 1 9 v w c c a n o p y a 2 n d w i b

were fused to generate daily reflectance measurements with a 30 m spatial resolution the downscaled nir and swir reflectance were used to calculate daily ndwi with 30 m spatial resolution which was used to estimate vwc as well compared with landsat 8 near infrared band the statistical results of fused reflectance value is with r2 of 0 91 rmse of 0 09 compared with landsat 8 shortwave infrared band the statistical results of fused reflectance value is with r2 of 0 88 rmse of 0 07 compared with the ndwi value calculated from landsat 8 directly the statistical results of fused ndwi value is with r2 of 0 89 rmse of 0 04 the parameters of the trained linear model for corn and soybean plant vwc have been listed in table 1a the empirical parameters for corn and soybean canopy vwc have been listed in table 1b separately figs 5 and 6 show the scatter plots between observed and predicted vwc for corn and soybean fields separately the red diagonal line means observed value equals to predicted one therefore the distribution along the red line means monitored results with high r2 low absolute error and low rmse when focusing on iop2 ndwi can be used to retrieve plant vwc and canopy vwc both for corn and soybean with relatively good results although there exists a linear relationship between vwc and ndwi for both corn and soybean fields different crop type needs to be studied separately results show that same ndwi value may indicate different vwc for different crop type the coefficients vary with crop types ndwi value ranges from 0 44 to 0 53 for corn field while it ranges from 0 37 to 0 58 for soybean field within the same period corn field shows relative higher plant vwc with the same ndwi value with the increase of ndwi plant vwc increase rapidly for corn field compared with soybean filed in this study soybean field shows better statistical results with higher r2 both at plant and canopy level this may be caused by the influence of leaves growth angle and different canopy structures on near infrared and shortwave infrared bands reflectance table 2 as mentioned previously the study area was covered by two landsat 8 scenes we used both path 27 row 30 and path 26 row 31 landsat 8 observations there are only two landsat 8 observation available within the study period on august 7th and august 16th within these two landsat 8 passing days cloud contamination is relatively high in the study area if we only use landsat 8 to retrieve vwc too limited ground measurement is available to build the vwc retrieval model and validate the retrieved results by fusing landsat 8 with modis similar wavelength reflectance measurements through the improved downscaling method we can generate daily 30 m vwc with satellite observations and use ground based vwc on all sampling day to validate the results figs 7 and 8 show the time series of observed and predicted canopy vwc for corn and soybean sites separately sf01 ltar corn sf14 s32 sf04 sf02 s10 jpl cron s36 s31 sf10 s09 represents corn field sampling site id ltar soy s19 na04 s02 s03 s14 s21 s13 sf03 s18 s17 sf07 represents soybean field sampling site id from the time series of each sampling site we can figure out both the predicted and observed vwc increase with time the trend of the predicted value matches the observed ones quite well both for corn and soybean fields which means the model can be used to estimate vwc from satellite observations previously many field experiments have been done for the same study region remote sensing techniques have been applied to retrieve vwc successfully different from this study only one satellite sensor has been applied to estimate vwc combine ground truth measurements for instance jackson et al estimated corn and soybean canopy vwc through landsat 7 etm from mid june 2002 to mid july 2002 during smex02 field campaign for the same region with larger study area a growth curve of vwc for each crop type was developed to generate daily ground based observation both ndvi and ndwi were calculated to monitor canopy vwc for corn and soybean field separately ndwi showed better statistical results compared with ndvi with rmse is 0 73 kg m2 for corn field rmse is 0 20 kg m2 for soybean field chen et al monitored vwc with the same field campaign through modis observations same as the former one ndwi showed better results compared with ndvi with r2 is 0 74 for corn canopy vwc r2 is 0 52 for soybean canopy vwc recently a similar study has been done by cosh et al monitoring canopy vwc focusing on the same field experiment temporal interpolation was applied to generate daily 30 m observations from 16 day landsat 8 products while there exists no clear relationship between landsat 8 reflectance change with time different from this study the whole growing period from may to august was considered with rmse of corn canopy vwc is 1 37 kg m2 rmse of soybean canopy vwc is 1 10 kg m2 this study shows better results both for corn and soybean fields compared with the former work fig 9 a is the image representing spatial distribution of plant vwc on aug 10th 2016 fig 9 b is the image of canopy vwc on the same day respectively the error sources in this study mainly consist four parts 1 satellite observations both from landsat 8 and modis the satellite surface reflectance observations and vegetation indices calculated may introduce various sources of uncertainty such as atmospheric effects error from retrieval procedures weather effects and the degradation of sensors 2 error from ground observing the error from ground observing mainly from three ways error from instruments human induced error while conducting the experiments experiment design error when researchers designed the field campaign although site representative decreasing human and instrument induced deviation and re calibration have been considered carefully error may still be introduced in unexpected ways 3 error from fusion model the improved fusion model applied in this study consider there exist linear relationship between modis and landsat 8 reflectance bands with similar wavelength on observing and predicting date in reality the relationship between modis and landsat 8 in more complicated than linear relationship besides that we treat the effects from surrounding pixels the same to the central pixel the relationship between neighboring pixels is unknow yet 4 error from vwc modeling model ndwi vwc relationship we simplified the vwc monitoring model in this study to just consider ndwi there are several other factors that may affect vwc monitoring and ndwi vwc model parameter as well such as soil moisture surface temperature leaf area index 5 discussion up to now most downscaling studies to fuse modis and landsat bands mainly focused on ndvi and lst estimation in this study we revised an existing fusion model to combine modis and landsat 8 near infrared and shortwave infrared reflectance to generate daily 30 m ndwi for the estimation of various scales vwc at both good spatial and temporal resolution for different crop types through data fusion daily plant and canopy vwc at 30 m spatial resolution were obtained the results show linear relationship between ndwi and plant canopy vwc within the crop reproductive growing stage for both corn and soybean fields the limitation for this study is that we only have in situ observations for a short period missed observation for vwc with the corresponding ndwi ranges from 0 1 to 0 3 with broader dynamic ranges of ndwi and vwc the relationships may change for example some previous works found nonlinear relationships chen et al 2003 jackson et al 2004 6 conclusion this paper proposed an improved downscaling method to generate daily 30 m surface reflectance measurements within the study area by combining modis and landsat 8 then mapping various scales vwc with high resolutions for corn and soybean fields separately based on a regression model through ndwi datasets firstly we overcome the difficulty of using ground observation to train and validate the vwc monitoring model through satellite derived vegetation index ndwi since limited valid ground measurements can be collected by field experiments we downscaled daily 500 m modis surface reflectance bands measurements by fusing 16 day 30 m landsat 8 observations for bands with similar wavelength through a revised data fusion model to generate daily plant and canopy vwc at 30 m spatial resolution during crop growing season secondly vwc at plant and canopy scales were retrieved separately the plant vwc and canopy vwc play significant roles to indicate agriculture drought condition as well as leaf water content and may be applied to further microwave soil moisture monitoring thirdly corn field and soybean field were studied separately the rmse of corn and soybean field plant vwc is 0 1 kg plant and 0 02 kg plant the rmse of corn and soybean field canopy vwc is 1 31 kg m2 and 0 94 kg m2 respectively the r2 of corn and soybean field plant vwc is 0 44 and 0 78 the r2 of corn and soybean field canopy vwc is 0 66 and 0 85 only with high spatial resolution different crop types can be classified effectively and study area within satellite footprint can be considered homogeneous the vwc varies a lot for corn and soybean fields with the same ndwi value both for plant and canopy scales which illustrated that same ndwi value indicates different vwc for different plant type author contributions michael h cosh designed the overall field
